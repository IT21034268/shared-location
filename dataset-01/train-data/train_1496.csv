1,Disappointing,I'm disappointed with both of Wigram's concordances -- this Hebrew one and his Greek one. I guess I should have bought Kohlenberger's concordance (smile). The print quality is poor.
3,clarification,It's important that the buyer know's that tis book is a reproduction of another one produced at XIX century.Good for research on old bibliography greek art
2,"Sorry, Billy - Not your best","I have been involved in fitness and martial arts (teaching, coaching and training) for decades and am always looking for a great workout that combines strength, cardio and martial arts. I have some TaeBo DVD's that I really like - my favorite being ""Billy's Bootcamp"". This one was a big disappointment. I was hoping Billy's counting and workout-logic would have improved with experience. Yes, you'll sweat, but it's not an organized workout that makes any sense at all and is missing some of his trademark glute and ab killer moves. I love Billy, but not this workout..."
5,Love this workout,"Product was delivered quickly. This is a great, intense, very effective workout. You really get a good sweat going and the weight routine is great for sculpting."
1,NOT IMPRESSED WITH THIS DVD,"I watched this DVD for about 10 minutes and then I had to hit the eject button. To start with all you hear is the women who workout with Billy counting from 1 to 8 over and over and over and over again. Then, to top that off, Billy goes through the entire routine expecting you to know the moves right off the bat. This DVD was very discouraging to me. I ended popping in the Kenpo X DVD from my P90X series so I could get the same type of workout. In short, I would not recommend this DVD to anyone. I am sorry I bought it."
5,Tae Bo Ripped Extreme,I purchased Tae Bo Ripped extreme because I wanted to take my workout up a notch. I usually work out 5 days a week. The first time I did Tae bo ripped extreme I could hardly get through the workout. This workout is a BEAST. The first part of the workout is cardio and in the second part they incorporate hand weights. I own several Tae Bo DVD's and this is the hardest one that I have done thus far.
5,AWESOME workout!!,"I LOVE this!! Such an amazing workout!! I got this dvd hoping it would be a good supplement to my high intensity Zumba toning class that I'm only able to attend once a week now. I'm so happy to say that this workout definately delivers!! I'm always dripping sweat and definately getting an amazing workout, especially with the weights he adds. I've done it with weights, without weights and done just the first half when I'm short on time. It's very versitile. I love that he combines cardo TaeBo moves and then adds in the hand weights. It's a full body workout especially if you are engaging your core the entire time. Would totally recommend this to anyone wanting to get a super sweaty full body workout. Plus Billy is always so motivating. You really can't go wrong!!"
3,Tae Bo Ripped Extreme,"I love Billy Blanks. He is inspirational and I like how moves are all done in rythmn/counting sets of 8. Tae Bo Ripped Extreme is NOT my favorite. I didn't like how ""creative"" he got with the moves in places, making it difficult to follow. Too many combo moves in one set. I prefer his ""This is Tae Bo"" that came out around the same time. That one keeps you moving and isn't too complicated. You will sweat either way- but I found this one more frustrating."
4,pretty good,I have done Billy Blanks workouts for years. This is up to par with his older titles. If you are a fan of his and you like Taebo this doesn't disappoint.
5,this works for real,"ahh....man this tape will put anyones body back together, i am a 49 yr old male and i was going to the gym daily, had to quit the gym because i opened a store, too busy to go... i do this tape at work in 20 min intervals, about 50 mins long total, the workout is in two parts one with 3 to 5 lb weights doing some aerobics with the weights it really does it man. and the aerobic part without the weights is pumping too. both workouts run concurrently so you can stop between the two, to the guys macho guys, this tape is for you even though it looks wimpy with the ladies and weights, but i swear it put my stuff together, and for women, yo stuff will be ignorant fine."
1,Disappointed,I received my video and was disappointed in the production quality. The first half of the video it seems that Billy's microphone is off and the only audio was the group counting extremely loud which was annoying. It was hard to follow when you can't hear his instructions. His audio didn't come on until the last portion of the workout. I havent' used it since....
4,Decent workout,"I used to do lots of TaeBo, but got away from it for awhile. I purchased this one to add to my collection of workout DVD's. The first half of this video is pretty good, although Billy seems a little stressed out. The girls behind him are giving each other high 5's and he chastises them several times for wasting time. The first half is all cardio which is good. Unfortunately, the 2nd half is all upper body weights. It seems like about 45 different arm/shoulder exercises in a row! No one needs to work out those muscles for that long, in my opinion. I thought the video was ok. I fast-forwarded it through half of the strength stuff because my muscles were fatigued from the first 15 exercises."
5,awesome work out,"I love this dvd --- you really get sweat and sore the next day. hard work out and you feel the burn. i use it every day, i love the fact that you sweat a lot and hard to breath. means your burning more calories."
5,Billy Blanks just gets better and better!!!,Awesome workout! Billy really brings it and even the very fit will find themselves huffing and puffing. I am very glad I purchased it--You will be too.
4,Definitely a good workout!,"If you're looking for a cardio workout, then I would recommend this. I've done his This is Tae Bo video, and this one is more challenging and gets your heart pumping. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because he spends about half of his time telling his exercise girls to have more energy, almost to the point of berating them. It got a bit annoying to me after awhile, but if you can get past this, it's an excellent exercise - not for beginners."
2,Annoying..,"I love Billy's Bootcamp workout. so I purchased this.This is a quite annoying workout. They change moves so many times I am so busy learning new moves I don't know if I can get any workout done. I am not really in for learning new dancy/kickboxy moves every 20 sec.I only used twice, and I really don't think i will do it again."
4,Works up a good sweat,"No regrets at all about this purchase. It gets my heart pumping for the first half hour, followed by another approx half hour of toning using weights. The latter puts a greater focus on the arms and upper body, which I need. Two of the choreographies had my feet in a tangle the first couple of times, making this a little more complex choreography-wise than Billy Blank's Cardio Inferno. Something that disturbs me about this DVD, and the reason that I didn't give it 5 stars, occurs somewhere towards the end of the DVD where Billy Blanks asked one of the team not to give up. His tone and demeanor then, the way he said it, and the expression on his face, make very uncomfortable. I don't think that was necessary at all, and its a pain having to see that regularly.ON the whole, a good workout."
4,Like...,"I like Billy Blanks and his DVDs but I am super advance and this was sort of an 8, you have to keep moving to feel the workout! Its a nice one! Thanks BILLY AND TEAM! ;o)"
5,Fantastic work out!,"I own a few Tae Bo DVD's, and this is one of my favourites. Even if I'm not in the mood to work out, when I put this on that all changes! I know some reviews are saying about the complicated moves, and I agree, at first go, you could be a bit lost, but the idea of these workouts are that you are not going to do them just the once! After a few workouts, I got the hang of the moves, and I'm so uncoordinated. I find the jumps with the weights a bit hard on my knees, so I just carry on with the weights and do a squat instead. I have seen some great results with this and recommend it. I do on alternate days with Ultimate Tae Bo, check that one out too."
5,Great Album!!!,"An Absolute Most Buy for Trance Addicts! If your a fan of Trance Allstars, or just good trance music in general, this is a definite must buy. Great Tracks and new tracks from Dj Tauncher. It includes the new single Go! and Lost In Love. I recommend this album to anyone."
2,Pitifull..........,"Trance Allstars....sounds good huh? Even the box art is appealling, but In my opionion, it's one of the worst trance cds Iv'e ever bought.Pretty much all the song are annoying pounding with some gay voices, and some lame melodies. This isint trance, heck, it's not even a lame attempt at techno. Only ATB's tracks save this cd from being total crap. Don't waste your time."
5,The Most Atmospheric album EVER,"This is most definitely not the original black metal BURZUM, but it don't matter. Varg was seeing before he went to prison that everyone in black metal was doing pretty much the same thing. He took the format of black metal and mixing with the apparent story continuing life he has. The first song, ""Tuistos Herz"", is a gong (?) banging classical masterpiece, moving in and out of worlds. The second song and my favorite, ""Der Tod Wuotans"", is a indescribable song that makes me travel to the stars beyond the stars. The seventh song, ""Frijos golden traunen"", lets my mind travel to iced trees and sparkling rivers of unmoved crystal lakes while I taste the sweetest bush rippened fruits. The ""lyrics"" (altho there are none in the music!) in the booklet pages are (I thinK) meant for reading while listening to the music. Varg continues to show why he is, and always will be,the King of Black Metal."
5,Excellent,"Great solid pipe, bends are clean and it was a perfect fit. The price was great also. Recommend this for your Jeep Wrangler YJ."
5,Fit perfect and a great price,I bought this for my 87 Jeep Wrangler 4.2L. It fit perfect and was far cheaper than any of my local auto parts stores.
4,It's a pipe....,"What can I say? It fits. It carries exhaust. It works. Does it look pretty? I guess, but again, it's a pipe"
4,Very cute...my daughter is still learning how to place pieces,"Very cute and well made. Shipping was fast and came before expected delivery time. My daughter is just over two yrs. and has had difficulty with odd puzzle pieces. Each side of barn door's have unique angle so it must be placed correctly to fit. She gets frustrated but, don't we all when we learn and don't get it the first few times:) She will get it soon I'm sure. Excellent******"
2,Wrong Item ... twice,"I can't rate the item pictured because I have yet to receive it. I received the Melissa and Doug Farm Peg puzzle instead of the Farm Peekaboo. I returned the wrong item and reordered as directed by customer service. I received the Farm puzzle again. The bar code on the back of the puzzle is wrong. I love the Farm puzzle, but I already have it. I will search for the Farm Peeka boo in a store. I fear they are all coded wrong."
4,Brow brush,Spiral brow brush was as expected. I had a bit of trouble figuring out how the brush came out and accidentally pulled on the band. It would have been helpful if a small arrow were imprinted on the band. Other than that the brush works fine. It is attractive and neat. Brushed aluminum made it very handsom looking
4,Really nice and portable,"The brush is thick and sturdy, great for unclumping mascara or just keeping eyelashes and eyebrows groomed. I deducted a star because there is no place to put the cap on the stem. I have to hold it or lay it down, and if I am in a moving vehicle like a train or plane, I could lose it. Other than that, it was a nice purchase."
3,It's retractable but not compact,"I purchased this item thinking it would be a space-saver in my crowded makeup bag and for travel--to me, that's the whole point of having a retractable brush! This brush is actually larger than the brush I was already using, which is not retractable. The design could be improved to make this a lot more compact while still being easy to use. The brush is okay, but nothing special in terms of quality. Knowing what I do now, I would not buy it."
2,Skeleton Spider,This product is very plastic. The hands can be repositioned and the skull turns. Product is nice but seems that it could be broken easily if moveable parts are forced.
3,Great book,"Having adopted from Vietnam, this book was so real. But even for those who have not adopted, the story really helps one see the paradox of adoption, a child given up by a birth mother, yet adopted by a forever family. I couldn't put the book down and it brought all the sights, sounds, and smells back from Vietnam."
4,Good performance from an unexpected source.,"I'm not a big fan of Zubin Mehta's Mahler. His New York recording of Mahler's 5th for example is mediocre. This one however is one of my favorites; it sounds great for the time it was recorded, and is lively and coherant, two qualities lacking in many of the recordings of Mahler's 5th. Recently I've heard more of Mehta's Los Angeles recordings, and I must say they make a better impression than the later New York and Israel Philharmonic recordings."
3,OK but not more,Lustans have really done quite some better stuff in the past. They are well past their prime unfortunately and the old records are really worth searching out since they are quite outstanding.
1,One of the worst movies I ever had!!!!!!!!!!!,"Is this movie for real????? W-h-y is this movie out there for sale.Thousands of movies I have (dvd, blu ray and 3d)this is one of the worst I ever seen.I have only one thing to say about the people who made this movie. F;.)(&('.'..*^%*%$&*(^("
2,Nah!,"This was classic ""B"" movie. It had some interesting stuff but just did not hold my attention enough. A lot of the recent zombie movies suck!"
4,"Actualy, Not Bad","For a SyFy produced movie, this is really pretty good.Even though the stars look wayyyy to healthy and coiffed, the writers actually have them doing things that make sense(not making noise, smelling for the rotten zombies, only engaging when necessary). I was so pleasantly surprised by this film that I bought a copy to watch again.True, the ending is typical SyFy crap, but 90% of the movie is worth watching.You could do a lot worse when picking a low budget zombie film to watch."
1,pass on this move,boring.poor special effects.waste of time an money.the only good thing about this move it will put you to sleep.would not recommend.
1,2012 Zombie Apocalypse,I guess Ving Rhames really needed some money to make a Crap Movie like this.The acting was so bad I had to just laugh at this Crap.I wonder did Ving look at this movie?
2,Stale zombie movie,"I didn't think it was possible to create a stale zombie movie these days, given all the new angles coming out of Hollywood, but this one is pretty flat. The acting is serviceable, and the special effects were better than expected. But the plot is by the numbers. Traveling group of survivors gets surprised by a bunch of zombies, somebody gets killed, actors an get emotional scene as they mourn the death, and everybody moves on to the next surprise attack, and the process starts over. One thing that does stand out is an undeveloped plot twist that zombies are setting traps. The idea is introduced, but doesn't pay off with any big surprise."
1,The worst movie I saw this month... and that's saying something.,"<strong>Zombie Apocalypse</strong> (Nick Lyon, 2011)I somehow got roped into watching another movie made by The Asylum, one of the worst studios on the planet. But my pain is nothing compared to that of Ving Rhames (<em>Pulp Fiction</em>) and Taryn Manning (<em>White Oleander</em>), both of whom were somehow convinced by casting director Gerald Webb, an Asylum regular, to star in this mess. Did they really need the money that badly?There is a thin plot (a bunch of survivors of the title malady have to fight their way to a human refuge that may or may not exist off the cost of California), but it's not worth going into any detail over. Nor is anything else about the movie, its fake CGI, its overacting, its godawful cinematography, its beyond-belief fight scenes. There is not a single thing about this movie that might make you want to watch it. Nothing at all."
3,"Why are there still edits in this ""uncut"" title?","A shame to get this entertaining zombiefest on DVD, with ""uncut"" splashed across the top of the box, only to find at least 2-3 moments in the film where dramatic cuts have been made to avoid showing direct zombie kills or devouring deaths of human characters. Fail. No more Asylum products for this finicky film fan."
5,I love cheese,"I bought this when I was watching it on SyFy. I am a huge zombie fan and thought this was a real cheesy movie. But how cheesy and horrible it is, is what makes it that good to me. If you expect a 10 million dollar movie, then do not get it. But if your just wanting to relax and laugh a little, then buy it. Most of the people who give it a bad review are the ones who take life too seriously. If it was on the SyFy network, you can't expect it to be the best movie. Enjoy."
2,Should have tried for a comedy...,"Zombie Apocalypse. On the plus side...it stars Ving Rhames. The first five to ten minutes are actually quite good. And then the first fight scene with the zombies takes place. The effects look like a mix of a cheap video game and a bad college class project. Plus, it had ""Crab Man"" from ""My Name is Earl""...From the moment he showed up, I waited for it to take a comedy approach. It was only a comedy in one regard...comically bad."
3,Grade A Cheese Fest.,"This movie had potential. I did not read any of the reviews before I bought this film. I do collect zombie movies but I wish I knew it was a SyFy movie first or I would not have paid the 10 bucks for it. SyFy movies belong in the 2 dollar bargain bin, not in the 10+ dollar range. If you appreciate zombie movies in all their various forms you will enjoy watching this film. If you are looking for something high budget that pays attention to detail and does not have crap CGI, buy it when its 2 or 3 bucks."
1,bad movie and love zombie movies!,"everything sucked about this movie story, zombies and characters, i really wanted to find a good movie but i guess i will just stick to walking dead!"
3,i liked it,"I`am kind of a vombie fan myself.Any thing with the walking dead for some odd reason I like.I thought the movie was entertaining and I watched it a few times.I liked the idea of the vombies that were fast runners.And the one dude was not only fast but built also,the one who was killed by the chain saw.I thought all the actors did a ok job for what the budget was.If your a big vombie fan like I am,this film is a must watch.I look forward to more vombie films in the furture.Of course if I don`t become a vombie myself""wink"""
3,Zombies!,I think they had a good script to work on this movie but unfortunately they don't have the budget to make it work all that well.. it's a B movie but I watch it from beginning to end. 2.5 StarPlot : Bunch of survivors tying to reach coast of California for the last safe haven in the catalina islands
5,Very simple and easy tool. And NO scratch!!,"It looks like this product has been around for years. (There have been good reviews since October 2000.) So I decided to get one. I received it quickly from Amazon (with no shipping charge since I purchased other stuff that exceeded $25). I must say I like it very much. And I will buy a few more with my next Amazon purchase.I tried it on my lowly point-and-shoot 35mm Olympus camera first. The brush does not seem to scratch the optical lens and the compound works like a charm. After that test I moved on to my Nikon Coolpix digital camera, Nikon N70 35mm SLR and my new Nikon digital D70 SLR. Under bright lamp, I carefully examined the lens surface, it passed my eyes. No scratches or lines. It really does a great job. I am impressed.I was tempting to buy a similarly priced Nikon brand cleaning pen but now I don't need to. This one already does all I need to do.Now my next step is to get one for each camera bag."
5,Handy accessory,"I have a SLR type digital camera I use this pen on ,It seams to do the job And its compact. Very good product"
2,Change 2 stars to 5,"This is the best way I have found to keep my lenses and filters clean. This pen even cleans the ocean mist that accumulates most days that I shoot along the shore. Better than pre-moistened papers, and way better than dry papers with bottles of stuff. My 2 star rating was made in error but I haven't been able to change it."
4,Indespensable,I've used Lens Pens since they were introduced. The chamois end is great for smudges and I've never damaged a lens coating with it. I never use the brush end since it is rather coarse. I prefer a bulb blower and a goat hair artist's brush.
4,"great song, but cd should contain better mixes","I bought this CD. It does not have instrumental Minimalistix & Lange Mixes, but it features a great and powerful remix by DJ Shog. Unfortunately, many quality mixes have never been released on cd in any country and are available on vinyl only:Reason (Mark Lawrence remix)Reason (Hemstock and Jennings Remix)Reason (Triple R Remix)Reason (Original mix)"
4,Get It While You Still Can,"The harmonies in the song ""Come the Fall"" are, for any fan of The Association, enough to merit owning this CD. The album is sufficiently obscure that once it goes out of print, I would not count on seeing it again."
5,Remembrance of Things Past,"Here is a fascinating ""snapshot"" of SP passenger operations. Based on an SP consist book, the author provides detailed information about the different types of cars operated on SP passenger trains. Production values are excellent throughout this work, captions match pictures, and the printing quality is uniformly good. There are ample selections of interior and exterior pictures of SP cars, most in color, and good coverage of dining car service as well. All in all a worthwhile addition to your collection of passenger train materials."
1,Outdated and boring,"As I was reading this book, I kept wondering how anyone would think readers would be entertained by such vapid characters. And if it was aimed at a teen audience (if Amazon identifies their e-book genres or target audiences anywhere in the descriptions, I haven't seen it), what would be appealing to today's sophisticated teenagers or young adults in a story about these substance-less girls of the WWI era? Then I looked on Wikipedia and found that ""Laura Lee Hope"" was a pseudonym for several authors writing between 1904 and the 1930s for series like ""The Outdoor Girls"" and ""The Bobbsey Twins."" Well, that explains it. I guess the book might appeal to someone who remembers such books fondly, as long as their reading tastes haven't become any more refined in the last 50 or 60 years. But as far as I can see, the only thing this book has going for it is the lack of grammatical mistakes and typos so often found in many recent e-books."
5,Best ever advice for curly girls.,I've read every book on hair care and tried every product ever created for naturally curly hair and this gem is by far the best. The author gives the most practical advice for achieving the healthiest hair you have ever had and a new attitude for embracing your curly self.
5,GREAT BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am mixed black/white and i have very different hair than most. i have the brittle frizz of african american hair but the softness of caucasian hair. I have relaxed, sprayed it, gooped it, dyed it, anything to get me to like it more. The first step in this book is to stop shampooing - just that tip alone has made my hair stop breaking and look so weighed down. Read the the rest of the tips they all are amazing!i recommend this book, it was a big help!"
4,Curly Girl Book,"This book was in good shape, arrived promptly and no hassles. I recommend this company."
1,'Flaking It' recipe--don't try this at home,"This is a review of the 'Flaking It' recipe in Massey's Curly Girl. For anyone out there thinking of trying the 'Flaking It' recipe for ""dry, flaking scalp"", don't. That is, unless you want your hair to smell like vomit.The recipe calls for massaging whipped heavy cream into the scalp. Not only does it create a total mess and is difficult to wash out of your hair (even after shampooing and conditioning), it makes your hair smell like vomit. I'm not kidding. I should have known better--there's a reason you don't let cream get warm, it goes rancid. When you apply heavy whipping cream to your scalp, it warms up."
4,"Nice book, but not really for African-American women","Overall, this is a good book with helpful tips that can be used by all women with curly hair texture. However, most of the black women featured either are biracial and have relatively loose curls, or they choose to wear very short hair, extensions or locs and don't necessarily have to deal daily with their curls. There is a chapter dedicated to African American women, but the only style suggested specifically for African American women is the straw set, which is only for short hair, is incredibly time-consuming and therefore not a practical style for everyday wear. Despite these complaints, the book offers some nice homemade recipes and I believe the underlying principles of hair care can be adapted for women with especially curly and kinky hair."
2,Limited in its usefulness,"If you must maintain an authoritative, professional, or conservative appearance for work, this is not the book for you. The resulting hair styles are frequently described in it as ""wild"" and ""sexy"" -- not words normally associated with a successful climb up the corporate ladder. Indeed, almost all the women featured are in creative or independent jobs.I know somepoeple are going to say ""but the corporate world is changing"" and I can only respond by saying, ""not really, not yet.""Anyway, for many of us, following the advice in this book would be tantamount to professional suicide. Be warned."
3,And now for some criticism,"She doesn't want you to use shampoo!!! Um, that ain't gonna happen! And have you seen the photos of some of the people in that book. If that is what my hair will look like after following her advice, no thanks.I'm a curly girl. I embrace my curly hair. I use shampoo (don't tell Massey, but sometimes I wash my hair twice in one day--shocking) and conditioner. My secret to good curly hair: a great stylist, good product and humidity.Apparently the author knows hair, but if you were to look at the photos of people who give testimonials about being a ""curly girl"" you'd wonder what they were thinking. I said to myself, ""did you realize you were being photographed for publication? because the pictures aren't really the most flattering."" The photos certainly gave me pause. If I follow her method, will I look like that? No thanks. I want to look good.There are some very witty moments in this book, the 12 steps to becoming a curly girl were funny."
1,new way to take care of curly hair,"I have been following this books recomendations and I love how my hair has responded. I have been using Deva products and am getting really incredable results. Great book. A whole new way of taking care of your unruly, frizzy hair. Every curly head should read this!"
2,Curly Girl,"I ordered this book by accident. It is not a very helpful book. I had read reviews on this book previously that indicated it was not a good book to purchase, but somehow it ended up on my order. To much trouble to send it back, so I am stuck with it."
1,Very Disappointed,"I hhave always had very coarse, curly, unruly hair. I would never follow the advice in this book and not use shampoo or a hair brush. That sounds gross and filthy. I just did not agree with the author. If a stranger stopped me in public and inquired about letting my hair grow out curly, I would quickly walk away."
4,Not just for Curly Girls!,"My hair is straight. Or at least I thought it was. I asked my stylist how I could get waves in my hair and she gave me this book.Turns out I'm not as straight-as-a-stick as I thought I was. Turns out, I've got some natural wave to my hair. I've been following the regimen, and have got more curl now than I ever had in my life.So if you're looking for curls where you thought there were none, read this book! Also, its an entertaining read, with the testimonials and such."
4,Great tips!,"I've been keeping my eye on this book online and finally purchased it. It's an easy read, I was able to get through the book in less than 2 hours.I found the book has a lot of great advice and has made it much easier for me to take care of my curls. I'm too curly for straightening my hair and besides, I don't want to straighten it.I think the best thing about this book is what to look for in the ingredients of products you purchase. Looking for the bad stuff is great, it makes it so much easier to know what products I shouldn't buy!The only thing I disagree with on this book, is that I think she left out a critical step for curly girls that have been using silicone based products for a long time. I felt it was necessary to use an anti-residue shampoo to remove all the build up I had on my hair. Once the buildup was removed I noticed that my curls sprang to life more quickly and the conditioner I was using started making a difference."
3,It's ok,Curly girl book is ok it u like it read about the curly girl but to me seeing is better on utube
4,Best I've Come Across,"I thought I was well-versed when it came to curly hair tips and tricks and what-have-you, but this is a valuable read with new insights. Pointers that WORK. I have often wished that there were magazines for curly haired girls at the hair dressers, because I never know how to describe the cut or style I want, and Curly Girl is basically it. Priceless suggestions."
5,This book changed my life!,"I have always been a nature buff but I totally went ""convenience"" when I had kids. After reading this book, I started read labels and using natural products again and I feel great."
2,Not that great,"I found this book to be a great disappointment. I read many of the reviews and thought it would have lots of information for women of color with curly hair. It does not.The short, short chapter she dedicated to kinky hair speaks of texturizers. Anyone who is natural knows that a texturizer is a weak relaxer. Why would we want to relax our natural hair?? I expected more, and I was highly disappointed."
4,"useful, fun, and helpful!","This book not only had lots of great tips for wavy and curly hair, but it is colorful and very fun to read. (It inspired me to go visit her salon in NYC) My hair has never been healthier. Well worth the $10."
3,"Good information, Bad Attitude","The information in this book is good. My hair is curlier and feels wonderful. It's a very inexpensive and chemical free way to treat your hair and scalp. I don't, however, recommend reading the ""testimonials"". Some of the women take their hair way too seriously."
3,Not for everyone,"I tried this book even though I was skeptical about not using shampoo. I followed the regimen religiously but got fewer compliments on my hair than I did while shampooing. Plus, by the end of the day I had smelly hair, no matter how much lavender mist I used! This book, while I think it would provide help/guidance for a curly newbie, is not for anyone who has been dealing with curly hair for the majority of their life. I am back to following my own curly hair routine, which gets me compliments everday. Worth a read, but not much more than that."
3,Not for someone in a small town,"The advice given in the book is very sound, and if I were able to find someone truly expert in cutting very curly hair I'd have it made int he shade. However, I live in a college town where the style is long and straight, and curly hair is an anomaly. I'm going to try cutting my own hair and see how that goes. And yes, it is possible to 'wash' your hair using conditioner only!"
5,A Must Have...,"...For any girl with even slightly curly hair. Apparently, even wavy hair can be curlier with the techniques and care methods described step-by-step in this book. I have curly hair and have always fought with it. Now my hair has never looked better and it's easier than ever to maintain. Granted, it will always be a process, but the results are worth it. The book also contains recepies for home hair care, personal curly girl confessions, and tips for African American curly girls. I felt empowered and, for the first time, proud to be a curly girl; it's given me a whole new lease on life(curls)."
3,Not for Wavy Girls,"I liked the book fine, however the tips did not work on my wavy hair. My scalp was constantly itchy and the top of my hair looked dirty and the rest just weird. I think it works well if you have truly curly/kinky hair but not on wavy."
4,Crrrrrrrl Power!,"I started out with wavy hair which I detested. Cancer took all my hair away and replaced it with raging screaming kinky curly hair. I hated it - but after readig this book I have totally changed my attitude. Now I love my hair and am not looking forward to the day my 'real' hair returns.I don't give five stars because some of the hair-care exilirs I tried did not seem to work like I expected.But this book is definitely an upbeat, you-go-girl, positive book."
3,Book Review,"This book has amazing info on curly hair care, and my hair has greatly improved since I've started using some of the techniques. The one thing I don't like about this book, is that the author mentions some inappropriate stuff, innuendo etc. Not excessively, but enough to bother me. You might want to look over this before your daughters read it, mothers. Besides that, it's pretty could."
4,curls galore,A must have for anyone that has curly hair. Great ideas for curly hair. Embracing my curls thank you. Item arrived in a timely manner.
5,Loie Swirls Again!,"Goddess of Light was a wonderful story of the life of Loie Fuller, an oft-overlooked but important innovator of lighting and other theatrical effects with great influence in the world of dance. Loie was not only a movement artist and an inventor but a businesswoman, who promoted other artists (i.e. Rodin) in addition to herself.Loie was successful because she was experimental, resourceful, and persistent. As this book describes in detail events in all areas of her life, we can come to appreciate this woman who capitalized on her ideas and opportunities, to know her personal pathos as well as her enthusiasm for her art. As a woman, I can appreciate the obstacles she worked through and the endurance it required. Thank you, Loie! Buy this book!"
1,Does not fit on an EA82T,"Maybe this set is for an EA81, because there's no way to make it fit on my car: the wires for plugs 1 and 3 were several inches too short for my EA82T, regardless of how they were run."
2,Pretty disappointed,"Shipping was SLOW. Then when I finally received it, I was dissatisfied and they didn't have a return policy. Never again."
2,"NIV Worship Bible, Large Print","If you read the NIV instead of the King James A.V.- please read - New Age Bible Versions, G.A. Riplinger--thanks, tom"
3,Good generic Bible,The print isn't as large as you might think. It's pretty much like the Bible's you see in motel room drawers.
3,Good enough basic reference Bible in contemporary language.,"As a Bright whose worldview does not encompass the supernatural nor mystical (an atheist in theistic terms) it might seem strange for me to own a bible, but I do try and understand what my Christian friends are referring to especially when they pick and choose verses out of context. Also, I want to compare passages between the arcane King James version and a modern version. What the ""bible says"" often is in opposition to Christ's teachings in the Gospels and I guess I want to understand where they are coming from better. As Mohandas Gandhi said, ""I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ."""
5,Love This Item,"Plain and simple, easy to read and the size is easy to handle. Hardback cover is great.If you're looking for the basic Bible in larger print, this is the best!"
2,"Bland, Boring. Disappointing.","Don't be fooled by the Amazon review where at the end it says: ""For fans of Sunny Day Real Estate, Death Cab For Cutie, Ben Folds, and Jimmy Eat World.""If you buy this album based on that, you'll be sorely disappointed. These guys make Something Corporate sound hardcore. Many of the songs sound eerily similar and they all have a very slow dragging quality to them. The songs go nowhere.One plus is that the songs do present a good message. But that's about it.Fueled By Ramen usually signs some great artists but I think they may have missed on these guys. Sorry, it's just not that good. I'd give this cd away."
3,Dark Dreamer,"Ok, I love books and just started reading lesbian romance books, WOW..great love sceens but the story is slow and ok development of characters.."
5,Refreshing,"I've been using Pre de Provence for months now and I can't say anything bad about them! This is not my favorite scent (lavender is), but it is still great. This brand of soap leaves my skin refreshed and not dry like everything I buy from supermarkets."
5,Milk Soap has Baby Powder Scent,"I ordered several scents in Pre de Province, and yesterday I opened the milk soap. It is awesome soap, like all the soaps by this company. The lather is unbelievable, it washes clean, and leaves my skin soft. This scent was a bit of a disappointment in that it smells like Johnson's Baby Powder. I do not like that smell. It is subtle, not overwhelming, but noticeable. If baby powder is not your thing, choose some other scent from their wonderful selections."
1,Total junk,"Do not buy this car if you want to have fun. First off, the instructions contradicted themselves more than once making it hard to put the car together correctly. Secondly, a number of the screws did not fit properly and as a result the driving gears did not connect well and would just strip instead of driving the car forward. Lastly, the car's steerng mechinism did not work at all. So bacically i was left with a car that would only drive backwards in a straight line. Overall the kit is just very cheaply made, and in the end is more frustrating to build than fun (which is one of the main attractions to this product). I would avoid this product at all costs, there is simply nothing good about it."
2,mehhh,"this was fun to build. It wasnt very hard to make, all you had to do was screw in some pieces. The directions were kind of clear, I understood most of the instructions but at times I was a ittle confused, but was able to figure it out. When it was time to drive it, it didnt really work. The motor would give out short bursts or do nothing."
2,RC car,"Took a couple hours over a couple evenings, our 10 yr old son had a good time seeing how the car went together."
5,TODD AT HIS BEST,"VERY GOOD AUDIO-VIDEO, GREAT SONG SELECTION. TODD IS AT HIS BEST IN THIS OLDER VIDEO. HE HAS A FULL BAND, AND BACKUP VOCALISTS, AS COMPARED TO JUST HIM, A BASS & DRUMMER, IN LIVE IN SAN FRAN. STAY AWAY FROM THAT ONE IT STINKS. LIAR IS ALSO VERY GOOD IF YOU LIKE THE LIAR CD YOU WILL LIKE THE LIAR DVD. BUT AS A VERY LONG TIME TODD FAN SINCE HE BEGAN WITH NAZZ, THIS IS REALLY VERY GOOD. HIS BAND IS GREAT, HIS VOICE IS AT ITS BEST. HE PLAYS VERY LITTLE GUITAR ON THIS DVD, AND LIAR. BUT THE GUITAR PLAYER IS EXCELLENT. LIVE IN JAPAN IS WELL WORTH THE MONEY."
5,why so much?,"I do not understand why this video dvd is over 200.00 I have seen songs from this dvd on youtube and would like to own a copy of the dvd but not at this price, I bought several other dvds by todd and none of them were close to this much."
4,Were You There?,"If you saw and enjoyed any of these shows then buy the disc and go back in time. The band is tight and Todd's singing is good. If you're looking for a show where Todd rips on the guitar, then this isn't it. Todd's out front singing most of the time and leaves the playing to his highly talented friends. Remember all those people up on the stage having fun and giving it their all? Well, they're all here."
5,TODD - FANATIC,"This is one of the BEST concerts going for TODD fans. Back up singers in spandex dresses, hands moving to the beat and classic TODD at his best!"
4,Good Reference for the Hornblower saga,"I just got this book three days ago.... I was very excited when I got it. I have read several of the Hornblower novels years ago. I want to get back into the saga from the beginning and use this as a visual reference.This book is similar to the one that was created for the Patrick O'Brian books. However, the second half of the book is notes and personal thoughts of CSF himself. Very interesting. I am looking forward to finding out the inner thoughts of this great author as he created and developed the Hornblower character as well as the various other characters.The first part of the book presents maps and descriptions of the various events for each of the books. It's a wonderful tool to help understand visually the circumstances of the events of the books.This book is a bargain for the Hornblower fan."
5,The Hallelujah Lass,"My granddaughter who is 12 yrs old loves these Historical, faith series books. I usually read them too. We have enjoyed sharing these true stories of people of faith.Excellent service;arrived on time, excellent condition."
5,An overlooked gem from a great group!,"This is a unique album and it is a shame that they did not receive the recognition they deserved during the short time they played together.I won't flog a dead horse here by going into great detail about the group or their music. If you want to learn more, check out my Orchestra Luna website at www.orchestraluna.com."
3,"My review of ""MATLAB for Engineers Explained""","The book is quite good for the price. However, the style of writing does not make it easy the find particular items of interest and apply them."
5,An outstanding example of the best cat detective series,"Joe Grey and his ""girl friend"" Dulcie are after the ghost of Hellhag Hill, who has already done several murders. Joe's human, Clyde is doing all the interfering he can, and the two feline eyes meet the Kit, who will be a character in future stories. Kit is another lovable feline character who adds a lot to this story and later ones. Joe and Dulcie are at their best in this well plotted whodunit. They actually take an active part in the detection and murder solving, unlike most of the other fictional Cat PI's, who are somewhat incidental to the real happenings. These cats are special! They are a little bit of a different breed and are able to understand, speak and read human language. They are highly intelligent, and highly capable of functioning in a human world. How they manipulate things and give clues to the human police is most interesting. This book is required reading for those who like cats and mysteries."
5,S. R. Murphy writes the fun books I love to read.,"Murphy does write enjoyable stories, Her plots are great, and her characters are fun to read. I can't wait until the next Joe Grey mystery comes out..."
2,cats as sleuths,Ms murphy's books get better.As a late comer to these books I really enjoyed reading about how new characters came alongI think the way the cats react to different events is really well done.Not owning a cat myself I would love one like Joe.but I suppose I'll have to make do with the neighbors cats who always seem to visit when anything is happening.
5,Great Service!,"Merchandise as listed and excellent in all aspects: shipping, condition, etc. Highly recommend this seller. Thank you!"
1,If only they acted like cats,"This is the first mystery series with cats I didn't like. Cats that speak English???? File it in fantasy, not mystery. I like my cats to act like normal cats, with the humans requiring *some* intelligence or curiosity. I think the author jumped on the bandwagon for some quick money in a proven genre. I wouldn't buy another one...or even borrow it from the library."
2,Not For This Vista User,After reading many positive reviews I purchased this gamepad. Unfortunately I can not get it to even work on my laptop. I purchased it for online games such as World of Warcraft. I downloaded the latest Vista drivers from the Saitek website but it still fails to work with WOW. I now have an attractive paperweight.
2,"Clunky, uncomfortable, cheaply built","This device is not very comfortable. I have small hands and the inability to adjust the wrist rest was a big drawback. The thumb stick can be rotated and pulled in and out but I noticed my thumb got fatigued because I had to reach a bit to use it.Overall the device is made from cheap plastic, it's lightweight and feels as though one bad drop onto the floor would break it. The software is a nightmare, I figured out how to program the mini-stick through trial and error and never understood the process.I owned mine for about 45 days and and the ""E"" key broke causing the button to be actuated all the time. I was actually glad it broke since it gave me the excuse I needed to toss this device and try the Belkin n52te, a well built adjustable sexy beast I am well satisfied with."
2,Good but not good enough,"I am giving this controller 2 stars because I had too many issues with keys that would send their strokes multiple times. I used it for playing poker and at times I would press a key for one window, the controller would continue sending that key to other windows causing me to lose money. I promptly stopped using it and have the Wolf King command pad."
2,Made for a man... :(,"Created for long manly fingers, which I do not have, I have small girly hands and although I did keep it since I desperately needed it I found myself re-adjusting the set up over and over, I just never got comfortable with it. The programing is insane, I tried to figure it out but just could not. When they mean this item is adjustable they mean ONLY the thumb pad is, kinda deceiving since it looks like you could also adjust the base and make it shorter, not so. the 4 top keys are too far for me to reach and the little joystick gets in the way more than anything. Also after 3 months of use the keys are really starting to look worn but have remain kinda hard to push. Keys 20/21 are a total mystery to me. I will say if you are good with programming keypads, if you have long fingers and you play very hard it should be right for you."
4,Good but could be better...,"Ive had this controller for over a month now,works great,fits perfect,all keys are in right place.My hand doesnt get tired,lights arent to bright,all in all it's what ive been looking for since i use a laptop to game with.Only thing i can complain about is the A key or left arrow key sticks in a long gaming sesion at times but then stop's works fine,other than that it's a great controller.Update 2/15/2011:the keys stick so bad that i can no longer use this product,i guess you do get what you pay for.To bad it didnt last very long as it was what i was looking for in every way.Im going to see what saitek can do about it maybe get it fixed....."
3,Okay game pad,"I bought this as a replacement gamepad since my son took his Logitec g13when he got a new PC.Its okay, I didn't need as many keys or want to spend a lot. It works fine.Some keys stick tho.. only after using it for a couple of days. The thumb""joystick"" feels cheap but I like how adjustable it is."
5,gaming with ease,"i havn't been using the command unit long but i love it. the software does take a little time to understand, but once u figure it out its a breeze. i play final fantasy xi on my laptop and i can use it as the numberpad seeing that i don't have one. if ur looking at buying a product like this get this one."
2,Frustrating,"My main complaint about this controller is that when a key is pushed to move my player, regardless of direction, it will continue to drift after the key has been released and will only stop after another key is depressed. This is completely unexceptable. I've been using it for about six months now and am fed up. I think it's high time to purchase a Belkin unit."
1,ProGamer Command Pad,"It's not comfortable to use, and the buttons are too stiff. It's a great idea, but the 'Belkin n52te' is easier and more comfortable to play with."
1,Only purchase if you're an expert on programming this,"I purchased this game pad hoping to be able to use it for gaming, of course. I'm an IT person and my fiance builds computers. We've both had a good deal of experience learning new programs and figurering out how to make hardware work. Neither of us has sorted this one out.We're only able to program a few functions for the games WarHammer and TOP. Neither of these games is difficult to navigate.Even if you are experienced, I suggest you spend the extra money and go for a product that users say is easier to program."
1,Save your money,"If i built a cyborg, i definitely wouldnt use cheap plastics. Although the fancy colors are nice on picture they remind of me of some bad disco videos ive seen on VH1. It didnt install well either, after the first couple times trying to install it and it crapping out in the middle of installation i junked it, yet again increasing my carbon footprint."
2,Not for the novice,"needs more effort of the manufactures side for configuration scriptsI do not have the time that is required for a Gaming add onand the Forums, and FAQ's are not of much helpthis has the potential of being a great deviceI view this much like Red Hat Fedora OSbelongs to the upper Click of time wasters"
4,good,"this is a good product, its ezey to program and its great for all the battlefeilds, and any other fps. its also good for a rts or just programs like microsoft word or macromedia flash. for exaple one button can be save, one can be copy, one can be paste ect."
2,"Great, but fragile","I had this item and it worked great until it broke. The problem is the thumbpad (its not a pad, it's like a mini joystick) on the side. I used this to move around (like AWSD keys) in WoW and the keys for skills. It worked nicely except the thumbpad thing breaks very easily. I sent it back to saitek with an RMA but they never sent me a new one back and I didn't even try to pursue it because I was just so disheartened with it. It does look great though!Bottom line is, if you're going to use the side thumbstick to move around, don't get this one. If you use the keys on top to move around then it should be no problem.The Nostromo thumbpad is an actual pad and so can take a huge beating. It's lasted me through everything. It's built like a tank."
2,ok product,cheaper than a nostromo n52...buttons are responsive...my major complaint is that the buttons are offset like a keyboard...if they would have put the buttons directly above/below each other i would have given this 2 more stars
2,Does what it's suppose to,"*edit - 2 years of ownership*I stick with my original review. I haven't used this in a long time, the only feature I liked about it that I left out in my review is that it has a good macro program that uses low system resources.*original review*Use is limited. The games I play, WoW BF2 WC3 SC are less enjoyable playing with this game pad. Yeah, it can be set to do alot of stuff on one key but you can never type directly on it, WoW has a key binding feature making this game pad completely useless, WC3 and SC along with other RTS not only need typability but keys like A S D F G etc to build units fast, BF2 just does way too much to be held in such a small gamepad (though I did manage to make a workable config for BF2, it didn't contain everything you might use). The only game that I have that I could play this with is Halo and Guild Wars because they hardly use any keys at all, which defeats the purpose of having this."
4,Almost perfect,"I had a Belkin n52te in my hands for a few days but never opened it afterreading reviews that the Saitek had more buttons and was less expensive.I am glad I took the Belkin back. The Saitek almost instantly improved mygaming as soon as I used it. I play FPS but I'm sure it would work well for other games as well. The only thing keeping it from getting a 5 star (and it may not even be the peripherals fault) is that sometimes I find myself stuck going in one direction until I press the opposite direction button i.e. the button doesn't stick, I just keep going even though I'm not pressing a button. Also, those not used to key mapping software may get confused. I found it easy."
2,We don't need another collection,"I bought this mainly to finally have ""Live My Life"". I was so disappointed in that it was a remix (and not a good one at that) and not the original single. Althought this collection exposed me to some tunes I liked such as ""Funtime"" and George's cover of ""What Becomes of the Brokenhearted"", this was a needless collection. I soon sold it."
1,who cares?,"I found this cd listing purely by accident - need I say more? Oh, alright: future landfill. Thanks for helping us all cut down on our consumption, Georgie."
2,Very hard,I was looking for a challenge and with this video you get that. However I was not aware that this workout is more for the arms and legs. Nothing more. I was kind of disappointed when I started this video. If I knew this video was more for the arms I would have not gotten the video.
2,Not my favourite,"Recently I have gotten into Bob's DVDs and I really love a few of them, Cardio Conditioning, ultimate cardio body and ripped core, are my favourites. But this one I did not like at all. Some of the moves I found too complicated for my un-co self to do, and there were a lot of moves that involved being on your hands in plank or push up position, which would be ok but I have bad carpal tunnel (from doing those moves!) so I can not do anything like that anymore. I ended up fastforwarding most of it. I did the DVD twice but now I plan on passing it on to someone else who might get more out of it. If you are tossing up between this one and one of the others I mentioned - I would go for one of the others."
4,Very Challenging Workout,This workout is tough! I have almost all of Bob Harper's DVDs and I think this was the most challenging. There were several moves I could not do. Something to work towards though!
4,Good job.,"Excellent. Very consistent workout. The instructor is well-prepared and knows exactly what hew wants to accomplish. However, it needs three or four more stretching (child's pose) breaks."
3,Great is sure it will somke you out but great excercise,Good dvd workout it touch but it will make a change you are looking for on your body .. Go for it see look the differents
3,Beginner DVD,"This is my least favorite Bob Harper DVD. It is a very basic/beginner kettlebell workout and did not hold my interest. It would be good for someone just getting started with kettlebells, but for someone looking for an intermediate/advanced kettlebell workout don't bother. I have been doing kettlebell classes at the gym for a year and this does not compare at all in terms of difficulty. I will not use this DVD again."
4,Tough workout but not for beginners or people with joint problems,"I don't usually use exercise DVDs but I have been looking for something for our family to do exercise together. Checked this one out from the library and tested it myself. The movements were not difficult but the repetitions with light weight were what made it a challenge. By the end you will feel the burn!If you're already in pretty good shape and wish to take on a challenge this is a pretty good one to try. But I wouldn't recommend this for beginners or people with joint problems. Unless you know how to modify the moves, the jumping and swinging will make the problem worse.One thing I really don't like about the video is that the people are always out of sync. They don't follow Bob's cues and were all doing their moves in different rhythms. I decided not to look at them and just listen to Bob's voice. That helped to prevent distraction and allowed me to focus on good forms.Overall, I enjoyed the DVD."
5,Another Toughie by Bob!!,"I LOVE this workout! I have been doing Harper's Inside Out workouts for a year now and love them. If you like Harper's tough workouts and are looking to add to your rotation, then this is a great one. It is for the lower body what Pure Strength Inside Out is for the upper body!"
4,Interesting and well-written,"It kept my interest (almost finished it in one long plane ride) and I felt the characters were written well enough to make the story come alive. I wouldn't make too big a deal about the ""surprise"" ending though - don't expect ""The Sixth Sense"" and you'll enjoy it more for what it is."
2,Did you people read the same book?,"Wow, was I disappointed with The Advocate by Axelrood. I was expecting a well crafted thriller with great Chicago overtones. Chicago is used here like an afterthought. The characters have mimimal personality and virtually no characterization other than labels: the gay guy, the mom-like receptionist, the mob-guy who swears like a sailor. Filthy language here.I would say it is well-plotted, though predictable in too many places.I expected much more. This reads like it was written by a junior college student. Poorly written indeed..."
5,Great read,Great read! The author definitely knows how to tell a judicial/ procedural/ courtroom story without being boring. Highly recommend this book!
1,Life Science book,"If I remember this book correctly, it was VERY dry. I believe it's Bob Jones' science. My kids hated the book. After this experience, I didn't use any textbooks from Bob Jones again."
3,Decent starter shoe,"These were the first climbing shoes I bought. They lasted about 6 months (climbing indoors 2-3 times a week) before I wore a whole in both toes. They are decently comfortable for a lower end shoe, but now that I have been climbing with my new 5.10 Anasazi's I can understand why they are so much cheaper. The Anasazi's are a huge step up in accuracy and aggressiveness, without really sacrificing any comfort. If you are new to climbing and aren't sure if you want to shell out $130 for shoes the eVolvs will be a good starting point, but if you want to do some real climbing look for something else. And start with the 5.10 Anasazi (FiveTen Men's Anasazi VCS Onyx Climbing Shoe)"
3,good shoe but not for beginners,the defys are comfortable and preform well for the majority of climbing styles. they are quite soft which makes them good for steeper climbing and very comfortable but reduces durablity. i think they are good shoes but would say that they are not a good beginner shoe. i can see the appeal to beginners as they are comfortable but ultimately feel that a beginner needs a shoe they can abuse. a good shoe for the advanced and intermediate climber but i would recommend something more durable for a beginner.
2,Subpar volume of Muench photographs,David Muench is a Master photographer of the remnant natural landscape of this country. There are many who have imitated his approach and failed to see the way he does. Thus it is disappointing to see a book fail to live up to his usually high standards. The production of the book was sufficiently low to make me wonder if it was rushed to press.
5,Counterreview,"Quote from the previous reviewer:""Let me explain. Books that sell well easily make morethan a million dollars, which is the estimated valueof the treasure. Is this being done out of thegoodness of the author's heart or for profit? ......However, I'm guessing this isn't purely a charitableenterprise.""This reviewer is truly irresponsible of his words, it's also abig shame that he is a so-called top reviewer.Quotes from the author's interview with NY Times:""...Using $2 million of his own money...""""...Any profits over his $2 million investment will bedonated to environmental charities...""It means he earns nothing other than happiness andexposure, he sacrifice his times indeed."
3,Staying power?,"Michael Stadther, A Treasure's Trove (Treasure's Trove Inc., 2004)With most of the actual treasure now found, Stadther's preface is going to get more important as time goes on; the book will have to be judged as a story rather than as a treasure hunting guide. Which leads one, of course, to the question of how the story is.It's not a bad little story, as these things go. Good guy has to fight bad guy because bad guy is doing terrible things to the forest and its inhabitants. Sounds like a lot of fantasy stuff, right? Well, that's both the good point and the bad point; it's familiar because you've read it before, though usually in much greater detail. Probably a good jumping-off point to get kids who aren't old enough for Narnia or the Lord of the Rings reading fantasy, but it's possible they'll be put off by the rather saccharine tone of the whole thing. **"
3,misses cult classic status,"Personally I find the story lacking depth or interest. However, for the idea of creating a book whose purpose is to go on a treasure hunt it is excellent. So it does deserve points for originality. The illustrations are well thought out, as obvious much more time went into them than some people believe. Most amateur artists cannot draw a comprehensive picture and incorporate clues and hints. It's worth reading once, and perhaps seeking out the treasure, but it falls short of a cult classic and beyond the end of the comptetition probably has no staying power."
2,Plagarized Kit Williams' Masquerade,"This is a rip-off of the British artist Kit William's book ""Masquerade"" that came out in the 1980's, and caused a massive treasure hunt all over England. The difference is Masquerade had beautiful detailed artwork on every page. This book does not."
3,Fun concept but....,"Okay, who wouldn't want to pick up a children's book and win a fortune? It's the ultimate fairy tale come to life. Conceptually, then, this book is a winner.However, if you're looking for a good story to go along with the treasure hunt, you'll have to look elsewhere.Other reviewers have complained about the book's clunky prose and poor editing. For my part, I was most annoyed by the abrupt and amateurish literary device used to avoid out-and-out telling the reader where the treasures were located. It reminded me of a humorous essay in which a veteran writer explains to novices that when he is unsure of how to end a novel, he solves the problem by writing ""Suddenly, everyone was run over by a truck. The End.""Bottom line: Don't expect an enduring work of children's literature -- or even a book worth re-reading (save for the treasure hunt part) -- and you won't be disappointed."
5,Good Book for Math Activities,"This book is an excellent resource for elementary math teachers. This book allows you to be creative with using children's literature in every day math classes. From using children's literature counting books to using a Dr. Seuss Book to teacher elementary geometry, this book is an excellent resource."
2,"Pretty, but ...","This is a pretty little ring, the CZ is bright and sparkles nicely. However, the band is so soft I can bend it between my fingers without even trying. Everytime I wear it, it comes off a different shape than when it went on, just from my body heat. I don't know if they didn't have my size when I ordered it and so stretched this one out too thin to fit me, or if has some soft lead mixed in with the sterling silver. The band is also a lot cheaper looking than that depicted in their picture. It is pretty but disappointing all at the same time. I would have to agree with a previous reviewer, don't get this one if you want to pretend it is something richer."
3,It's a OK ring,"I waited a long time for this little ring, and when it finally came I wanted to jump through the roof over it, but I just could not get up the steam to do so! This ring was not a complete disappointment but it was far from something I would proudly wear around if I was trying to pass it off as the real deal. For one, the sizing was off. I know I ordered my correct size but it was still a little too big. Secoundly, the dimound size was believeable, yet it looked a bit cloudy to me. The craftmanship was beautiful, but for some reason though it said .925 stearling silver it was a rusty color. Maybe that was part of the antique look, but I thought it was strange. Not a bad ring overall, but if you are looking for something to really pass off it's best to just buy it at a store so you can really see how it looks."
1,Boring....,I bought this for my six year old son who has thoroughly enjoyed the Reader Rabbit series since they have flexibility built in. This software is so rigid that he lost interest in about 10 minutes and announced that we could give it away.It is not fun.
3,JumpStart 2nd Grade,This is good game that will prepare your child for the 2nd grade but may not work with Windows XP Home Edition.
3,I love Jumpstart but this one is just okay,"In addition to our most recent purchase of JumpStart 2nd Grade, we have JumpStart Artist, Explorers, Advanced Kindergarten, Languages and Field Trip. My children love them all. JumpStart 2nd Grade, however, is not intuitive--even for an advanced kid. My son and I could not figure out how in the world to organize the computations in the math ""ice cave"". After several ""guesses"" we figured it out. Unfortunately the only instruction the game gave us was to use the columns on the left and top. There are no ""help"" functions so if you don't get it, you're on your own. And the games themselves aren't very challenging -- it's the figuring out how to play them that offers the most challenge :) It would be great if they had different levels of play. I still love JumpStart products...I'm just not a big fan of this particular one."
1,Disappointed,"Not impressed with this item, never got cold. When I called the company, they had a resigned attitude towards me returning it as if it happens all the time. There were factory placed stickers on the outside of the machine that looked like they were covering up things, they were white and I only noticed them when I took a closer look at the machine. It made me wonder if it wasn't a refurbished machine already. For the price, I can go and buy a gelato at the store and in the long run save myself a lot of time and money. Bummer though, I was looking forward to making my own goat's milk ice cream."
1,worked once,with great anticipation I waited for what appears to be the top of the line ice cream maker I own a restaurant and planned on making a flavor of the week. I got one churn sucessfully. tried to make another churn a couple of days later NOTHING locked up sending it back and will go back to the old wood bucket hand crank
2,50 minutes to turn 1 quart of ice cream?,"I've been using this machine for a few days,and am going to return it.The machine is just too slow.The looong churning time aerates the ice cream too much,and the quality of the finished product is inferior to other machines that cost a lot less money.I called customer service at Lello,and found the person that I spoke with to be rude and not very helpful."
2,"Not bad, but some quirks","This machine includes a pretty good compressor in it, which places it head and shoulders above some of those ""freeze the ceramic jar"" ice cream makers. Likewise it turns out thicker gelato consistently and in a short time-frame. The only difficulty I've had with it is seating the motor on the churning blade properly--it's necessary either to put a weight on the blade motor of the machine, since it doesn't snap into place. Otherwise you've got to fiddle with it until it works properly. I'm happy with the gelato, but the price-point is pretty high for something with a design flaw like that."
2,Mine stopped working!,"I bought this unit about 18 months ago and was initially pleased with it. It replaced a similar unit from this company which I had for years before it failed. My new unit wasn't used often over the time I had it. Recently I attempted to make ice cream and it wouldn't freeze. The compressor must be broken and I was told by the company when I called to have it fixed that it would be almost as expensive to fix as it would be to replace. The spokesman seemed very surprised to learn that the unit had broken in such a short time. To quote him, ""It usually takes the compressor longer to fail!"" Thanks, I wouldn't reocmment this brand to anyone."
2,Why do so many people like this?,"Purchased this as a replacement for my ""Simac Il Gelato Pro"", which freezes but stops churning as soon as the cream beings to set up.First major problem is the motor is permanently attached to the cover which makes no sense.. Cleaning it can be a very delicate procedure. The beeper on the timer is fairly worthless as it can barely be heard over the sound of the machine.Also, mine may be defective but even with a pre-frozen bowl and cold ingredients, we only get soft serve quality at best and it takes closer to 2 hours!."
4,Lello4090gelato pro,"I ordered my Lello 4090 gelato pro for the summer fruit season so that I could try the many fresh fruits in gelato. I was not disappointed in the gelato it produced, but for someone that does not cook, it could be a challenge. The directions that come with this machine are the worst I have ever seen. I am an avid cook, and still made about six different batches before I worked out the kinks.I would recommend to anyone purchasing this gelato maker to also purchase a cookbook on gelato making and not to rely on the manufacturer instructions or recipes.Saying all that, the machine does make a good gelato."
1,Don't waste your time........,This movie is very cheaply made and is so disjointed that it makes little sense. Flashbacks are given that just confuse the story. I did not care for this film at all. I love good horror movies but this is not one of them.
5,Heebie Jeebies,Well worth the price! Kept me up all night! Fantastic ending. Where can I see more of the actress who played Kelly?
4,great time!,"Awesome movie! great camera works, the story is realy nice, what an end! never would have tought. realy worth watching!"
4,great writing,"Low budget , cheesy effects, amature acting and directing , but what a great script. Has some really funny scenes - the funniest is a flashback / dream that really has NOTHING to do with the rest of the movie, but it was classic ! I alomst turned this off after the first few mins, but luckily I stuck it out and it was definitly worth the price of the rental ... not sure about buying it ,but , hey maybe. Check it out --- spacemutha ---"
1,Just plain bad!!!,"I started to watch this movie and after the first 30 minutes into it, I realized that it had no story and I had started to fall asleep. I don't even want to admit that I had bought it. I am just glad that I didn't pay anymore than $3 for it. It isn't even worth the plastic that it took to make it. Avoid this movie at all costs and save your money for a good B horror flick."
3,Need the CD to play this game,"I just received the game. I was a bit annoyed to find out that the CD has to be in the drive in order to play the game. I prefer games that aren't like this. If you have two home computers for the kids, I was hoping they could play on either machine.I was also a bit surprised when I first started the game. It just brings up a picture with absolutely no guidance or instruction. I had no idea what to do. I'm a programmer so don't usually have problems navigating software.I'm running on XP and that seems to run okay - though does seem to have to scale down the resolution for you."
2,Only for diehard Charlotte Bronte Fans,"Although the spark of creativity is there, it still takes some time to appreciated this novel after reading Janes Eyre. The main character Crimsworth seems to be arrogance, aristocratic, and audacious. This could be Bronte's first take on a male perspective, but is that what she considered the male psyche to be as she portrays on her other novels' male characters. All in all the novel has some worth, but needs getting used to."
4,Good description,"Although this is the first novel written by Charlotte Bronte and many people do not like the religious bias and racists in the novel, I feel that Charlotte Bronte correctly describe her characters, professors/teachers, even a CEO in a small company.I should say that those biases in the novel are very true in real-life, because the teachers generally look fastidiously at their pupils and consider them stupid. Such considerations are frequently mixed with religious and race bias. Actually, this novel describes how the protagonist feels honored when he has pupils from noble families.The only CEO, the protagonist's older brother, in this novel also can be seen everywhere in real-life, they generally are rude, and treat their workers poorly.This is very hard for a young writer to observe her teachers and bosses to such a deep degree.Compared with her other works, this novel appears simple, but how can we expect the great achievements from those characters?"
2,A significant portion of this book is in French.,"Just FYI, a fair amount of the dialogue in this book is in French. I quit reading it as I felt I was missing too much of the story."
3,Nothing to get excited about,"Talk about a classic with loose ends. Lots of who's and why's. Not clear on many main points, Bronte overlooked basic reader questions that were never answered. I thought more of this novel BEFORE I read it and now I'm convinced that this is the least thought of novel of all of Bronte's masterpieces."
3,A SO-SO NOVEL,"The Professor concerns the trials and tribulations of a young man growing up - choosing his career and dealing with the loves in his life. The hero of the book makes many wrong moves in choosing his life career, but finally ends up as a professor - and part time in an all girl's school. His adventures multiply here, as he runs into various difficulties with the school mistress and the various female students in the school.A good bit of the story revolves around his falling in love - briefly, first with the school head mistress, then with one of his pupils.The book is beautifully written, not that spell-binding, but not completely uninteresing, either. If you enjoy the Bronte sisters, then do read this book."
4,The Professor,"A quick read. Did not want to put it down. So many twists and turns, yet the story took you where you wanted to go. A Kindle favorite."
1,a couple of laughs,how do the Wayan brothers keep making wack movies&tv shows? now once in a while they have there moments but that doesn't happen as much as the wackness they put out.this film is another dud.the Wayans are like Jim Carrey&Adam Sandler i just don't get the appeal.all are very overrated.
5,One of the Funniest Movies Ever!,"Major Payne is hillarious. Both children and adults will be laughing throughout this fun and silly movie.Damon Williams does a superb job playing a comically overly strict drill instructor who takes over the education of a bunch of misfit ROTC students at a private school.Upon finding the children to be extremely undisciplined, Payne decides to shave their heads. The next scene depicts the boys feeling their newly shaved heads in disbeif as Williams barks orders at them. The laughs only increase as this funny movie moves on. If you like comedy movies, Major Payne is a must see. The plot is a little on the thin side, but the movie more than makes up for it with humor. My son actually watched the VHS version of this movie so many times that the tape broke. He has every line in the movie memorized, and it is among his favorites. Because of the breakage, I decided to purchase the DVD version for him for Christmas. I'm sure he'll be delighted."
4,Kids are Payne's!,"Damon Wayans is absolutely hilarious in this movie. Having worked at a school I can tell you that kids can be just the biggest pains in the butt, although after awhile they grow on you ( as Major Payne finds out too ) and you learn to love them ( as Payne does at the end ). Wayans character is terrific and if something hurts, he'll make you forget all about it ( inside joke, watch the movie ). Loved it !!!"
3,"old movie, is ok",saw this movie many years ago and remembered it being funny. our friend loves it as it appeals to his corny sense of humor so that's all that matters.
3,Excellent picture. Funny...Damon was superb.,"Major Payne is a movie about the Marine in all of us. It starts off with his time in battle and struggles in the Marine Corps.Major Benson Payne takes a position as the Commandant at Madison Academy. His transformation of the cadets is hilarious. He chews them out for everything and then as a disciplinary action he shaves off all of the cadets hair.Not only does Damon Wayans portray a motivated Marine full of integrity and honor he displays his human side to Ms. Wallburgh. Who ultimately transforms him into a passionate human being.Throughout the movie the humor never ends. Damon's use of words and military character make you laugh without end.If you have ever been in the miltary of know anyone that has been in, then you can relate to this movie.3-4 star movie that is hilarious.Damon Waynans did an outstanding job. 2 thumbs up. END"
5,GREAT MOVIE,I SEEN IT BEFORE AND IT WAS FUNNY I SAID I WANTED TO SEE IT AGAIN WELL I GOT THE MOVIE AND IT WAS FUNNY
3,Not for younger children,"There is quite a bit of inappropriate language and a little violence, so you may want to see it yourself before letting young children watch."
3,Okay...,"If you're familiar with Damon Wayan's roles in films, you know he takes a lot of characters that have what you might call annoying personalities (see his role as Michael Kyle in 'My Wife and Kids') and in this film it's much of the same. I think Wayans actually enjoys these annoying characters, but whatever.The movie itself is fairly entertaining for a 90's flick. Wayans plays a major at a children's military school, and there are some genuinely funny moments in this film, and some heartwarming moments. Part of the story is also about Major Payne trying to woo a pretty young nurse who has started working at the school. If you like Damon Wayans, you'll probably like this movie, just rent before you make the decision to buy."
5,Comedy for the whole family,This movie has some of the cutest/greatest lines in it - great fun for teens to adults - a little sappy in the end - but worth watching/owning!
4,Major Funny,"This was a funny movie. The whole family can enjoy this one. I miss those days when comedies was like this, fun movie."
4,Major Payne,"In order to win a war games competition, an insane Army major must convert a group of dysfunctional kids into true american heros. Major Payne is amusing. The story has a lot of potential, and much of it is shown. It is a very good comedy and a good spare-time watcher."
4,C-O-L-L-E-C-T,Damon Wayans is funny and a good actor. So somebody give him a job so he can stop doing all those telephone commercials (say butt).
2,I say 2 stars my family says 5 stars (lol!),"I am not the one to ask about this movie because I consider it to be like the Pet Detective movies, maybe not as bad as Pet detective, but not my taste, too annoying. There are some cute moments and even a little heart touching moments. My husband and our adult children love this movie....so I guess it's 3-1. They would rate the movie 5 stars."
4,Major Payne DVD,"A funny movie with so many one-liners and classic linesespecially for anyone who teaches and has taught students.Although old, it is a keeper."
5,A movie that former Marines can really appreciate!,"As you can see from the previous reviews this is a good movie that will have you laughing out loud. The people though who will really love this movie are the former and present Marines. Those of us who can be included in this latter group will find themselves laughing so hard that at times you will find yourself having to pause the movie to wipe away the tears from your eyes.Damon Wayans did alot of research for the character that he portrays, which included spending 2 weeks will real Marine Drill instructors. It has paid off well, because everything he does, from his voice cadence to the way he points at someone with his whole hand is completely authentic.So for all you former ""Devil Dogs"" out there, buy this movie, you will not be sorry."
5,I dare you to put this book down.,"I certainly couldn't put it down. Both times I've read it were non-stop sessions, and it is, I believe, the longest of the six books in this series. It's plotted so that the tension cranks up with every page turn, and you don't get off the hook until the very end. The ending is very satisfying. It really shows the depth to which Wilson understands his characters' and his readers' emotions.This isn't actually a very frightening book compared to some of Wilson's others (I'm thinking particularly of Reborn, which gave me literal nightmares). There is very little violence or gore, just the extreme tension of the plotting.I very much recommend that you read the other five books prior to this one if you want to appreciate the characters you will be meeting (you'll enjoy the other books for themselves, too). Then set aside one day (or night! yes, definitely a night) to read this one cover to cover."
3,plastic 3deck manual shuffler,"this shuffler is really made for a man's use, as you have to hold the cards down on each side, thus you need a large hand to span over the handle, as you need the other hand to turn the handle.i guess that is as best as it can get. My friend holds one side whilst I hold the other,then it works most of the time. sometimes the cards still get caught up in it."
1,TRASH,Poor construction. Poor operation. very seldom did it shuffle two decks with out a malfunction. Wife had recycled the box so I had to just junk the shuffler. Will not buy another sterling product.
2,Plastic 4 Deck Manuel Card Shuffler,"I bought this for my Mom because she lives in a 55 and up apartment and they play lots of card games. Only one side of this shuffler works. For the kind of money it cost, I would expect better quality. The automatic ones continued to break but at least they worked for a while. I will be contacting the seller for a refund or replacement."
1,Card Suffler,This product did not work at all for the purpose it was supposed to be designed for. It simply would not suffle cards. After trying to make it work many times we gave up. I do not understand how such a poorly designed product can even be offered for sale. It was returned for credit which was promply received. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
2,Missed the mark,The shuffler completely missed the mark as far as being functional. It didn't pick up cards very well -- even when we changed decks to a different thickness. I returned the shuffler and the company quickly issued a refund. They must have realized it was junk.
3,Good addition to your erotic video library,"We bought this video expecting a film version of the classic book of the same title, upon which the producers claim it is based. Sadly this is not the case. About the only thing this video shares with the book is the title, a few character names and a few very loose references to some episodes in the book. The producers obviously tried to ""improve"" a masterpiece, and as is typical of such efforts the product falls far short of the original. Had they simply dramatized the original book, this would have been a great erotic film.While it falls short of the book, this is still a good erotic film, worth watching, and adding to your library."
2,Don't remember it,"Quite frankly, I rented this a while ago and have completely forgotten it. The fact that it left entirely no impact suggests that I was not impressed."
2,"Well photographed, beautiful locations","But ultimately unsatisfying. The acting is extremely average. The plot is very underplayed; in fact, too underplayed. Even the erotic aspect of the movie loses its charm early on. I dunno. I don't think Anais Nin would've approved of this adoption of her work."
4,A discrepancy,"It is interesting to note the divide in people's taste. Hardcorists tend to frown at erotic films and eroticists find hardcore films offputting and daft. This one is more for the eroticists, hardcorists beware. Beautiful as such. Enjoy it."
3,Bland,"Oh, Audie England is cute enough, and looks great wearing not much more than Audie England. The story as a whole just didn't grab me, though.It's set in Paris, just before the German invasion of France in WWII. Somehow, all the excitement and tension of that time is lost completely. Instead, a self-involved woman is trying to advance herself as a writer by creating smut to order for a secret admirer. Huh?A few scenes are pleasantly steamy, but the movie as a whole leaves me cold.//wiredweird"
1,Shallow pornography,"Cinematography was very good but the writing was obviously a carrier for a pornography film. I a not a prude but I do know a good story and well-developed, if not admirable, characters when I see them. Acting was adequate for such a poor film. However, how are actresses supposed to act in pornography?"
3,delta of venus,I saw this video and thought that it was pretty good. I only watched it to see Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. He was the clairvoyant. The African who could predict things. I thought that he was very attractive and sexy. This is the only and most important part of the video to me. I'm waiting for it to come on DVD so that I can press menu and go to the most interesting part---adewale.
2,Much too large.,"This item was easy to install but much too large. The reason that I purchased the plug was to fabricate an unobtrusive, 18 gauge extension cord for a lamp. With compact fluorescent bulbs, wattage of light bulbs has decreased dramatically. Why haven't wiring sizes and plugs increased accordingly?"
2,Legs get scratches from hard tray plastic.,"I put this product together in 15 - 20 minutes. Put my 6 month old into the swing, place plastic tray into position. Next thing I know the baby starts crying uncontrollably, due to legs being scratched from hard plastic underside of the tray, and attachment pieces of the tray (3 inch scratch on right leg from corner of attachment). Even after removing the tray the baby kept scratching his legs on the attachment pieces for the tray, they are not removable just folds up or down. Only problem. Besides this the swing is sturdy & well-made. Haven't called evenflow yet. I will definitely return it."
1,forced to read due to being a follower of the series,"OH MY GOD what a tiring piece of work that fails on so many levels. I've just finished it and still have know idea what the point was and the only reason I even finished it was hoping there would be an actual point to it and actually I am a follower of the series and figured what happened may have later (im)pertinence to the series. As one other reviewer said not since the new adventures was there a more ""dense"" book. Pretentious more like. I usually can't wait to finish the Doctor Who BBS series novels however this one simply dragged on and on and on and had to force myself to finish. Unless you're a Doctor Who completist DO NOT WASTE A MINUTE ON THIS BOOK."
1,DEFIES THE READER TO READ IT,"WARNING: Reading this book may induce flashbacks to the worst history books your teacher ever forced you to read in high school!This ""novel"" is written as one of those dull, dry, historical texts and as such keeps the reader detached from the characters. There's little dialogue and the prose is written in complete exposition--that is, it tells but doesn't show. Add in the extremely small print, and you've got a book that begs ""Don't read me!"" Unless you're a die-hard DOCTOR WHO fan AND a devoted follower of the book series, you'll probably answer it by shrugging your shoulders and saying, ""Okay, I won't.""Things happen in the book that will directly effect the storylines of subsequent Eighth Doctor novels, and that is the ONLY reason anyone should even ATTEMPT to read this book. And even at that, you might want to first try searching the web for any blogs that sum up those events so that you can pass on this dreadful, dreadful book."
3,Really for Kids,"I bought the book thinking it would have movie posters. Instead, the booklet has photos of the actors each paired with a list of their favorite things such as -- favorite color, music, authors, vacation spots etc.It is a very nice glossy booklet suited for a very young fan.Kept the book though -- maybe I'll come across a twelve-year-old who likes Harry Potter."
2,Disappointed,"I have read 6 blackjack books now over the past few months and I was disappointed with this one. The information in the book is not presented in a logical, easy to follow manner. I found it to be scattered and fragmented. The information that Blackwood gives is correct, yet he does not go into enough details during several sections and the novice reader will not have enough information to be successful. Instead of buying this book, purchase Blackbelt in Blackjack by Arnold Snyder. The information is much better organized with much more detail which makes learning what you need to know much easier."
2,The book doesn't do justice to Confucius,"Somewhere there must be a book about Confucius that does him justice. This book isn't it. Confucius lived in a very violent world or war-lords and princes always fighting each other. Somehow, Confucius took a different path and tried to teach others the wisdom of non-violence and education. This man pre-dated Jesus by 500 years with his ideas of peace. This book gives some of the occurances in Confucious' life... and some good quotations... but it seems a lot is missing considering what Confucious is famous for. The illustrations by Tseng Yu-Ho are terrible. They look like childrens finger paintings on a fence! There is ONE good illustration before the title page of a charcoal drawing of Confucious.. but it is not drawn by Yu-Ho. This particular printing is beautifully bound in leather and has gold leaf pages. It looks nice on my shelf. I am no expert on Confucious, so maybe this is as good as it gets?"
3,Some Sweet Soul Music,"Catchy somewhat sassy Soul Music by these recent hall of fame inductees. Soul Man, Hold On I'm Comming, I Thank You, and Wrap It Up are classic numbers that will get anyone in an upbeat feel good mood. Said I Wasn't Gonna Tell Nobody is a pleasant surprise with a catchy hook around the chorus that compliments the vocals oh so well. Soothe Me is a nice low key bouncy tune and When Something Is Wrong With My Baby is a pleasant ballad.The rest is OK but certainly not very memorable. Truthfully these additional songs sound like cheaper rewrites of other songs by this artist and other soul musicians. Good music yes but not quite essential."

1,A Book for Un-Ambitious Users of Elements,"This book covers about 10% of Elements' potential. You will outgorw this book within days of using Elements.For example, I've learned from reading other books (see bottom of this text) how powerful layers are, whereas this book barely covers thier application.I'd strongly recommend the following 2 excellent books ""Photoshop Elements Solutions"" by Mikkel Aaland (who occasionally appears on Tech TV), and ""50 Fast Digitial Photo Techniques"" by Gregory Georges.I have all 3 books, and I find Aaland and Geroges' books a world apart from Andrews' disappointing, beginner-level book (nothing personal). I've also heard very good things about the ""WOW"" series but I haven't read them personally. Have fun!"
2,"Good information, but his conclusions are faulty","This book is filled with a lot of good information, but the problem I have is after carefully showing how messianic Judaism is really the brainchild and outgrowth of evangelical Christian attempts to convert Jews he throws up his hands and says that we should accept it as if it were a natural development of Judaism. It is not surprising that his views are soundly repudiated from all the branches in Judaism, including the Reform which he claims to be a member of."
5,excelente!,"Excelente! Olguín se gana, con su primera novela, un lugar de privilegio entre la generación de escritores jóvenes argentinos."
1,piece of junk,"poorly constructed , obviously made in china, junk. Not solid state, but simply a bi-metal strip that is not adequate to regulate anything. Don't waste your money."
1,This is not Rock Follies,"Expecting the book upon which the TV series 'Rock Follies' is based, I received a book titled 'Rock's Follies' containing stupid rock trivia. Attempts to contact the seller have so-far gone unanswered. Buyer beware."
2,Worse than a good blade grinder,"I bought this grinder as an upgrade for my old Mr. Coffee grinder, only to realize that it's not better at all. My major complaints are:1. Uneven grind. I can get both very coarse and very find grinds when I set the grind to be coarse, LOTS of sediments when I use the grind for French Press.2. Grind bad for Espresso. The finest grind is too coarse for espresso.3. Very loud.To be fair, this grinder looks nice. The brushed stainless steel is beautiful, but it simply does not do the job well."
4,Best Burr Grinder for the Price!,"This is the 5th coffee grinder that I've owned & it's the best! I love that I can grind up to 18 cups at a time. It lost one star because I would prefer the top be as slim as the base to take up less room on my counter. Consistent, fast & easy. Love it!"
3,Cuisinart Coffee Grinde w/ hopper,"So far this piece works great. You can preset the amount of coffee to grind, but it would be better if this selection was more fine tunable. I either have to grind a little less, or a little more coffee than I would like.This is my second unit I have purchased since my first one only lasted about 6 months. I called to late and the warranty had expired so Cuisinart would do nothing for me. If this unit lasts a reasonable length of time, then I give it 5 stars, but based on my first one, I have to downgrade it. But as you can see, I liked it enough to buy a second one. Though I have to point out, Cusinart does not follow through with very good customer service."
1,Unreliable coffee grinder,"I bought this grinder new, not refurbished. I rarely used this coffee grinder. I thought the top of the line grinder from a reputable name like Cuisinart would be a good one. Wrong. One day it just quit working. I called their customer service, and they said it was just gone. No resets, nothing could be done. Their advice? throw it away. that for a grinder that although it was out of warranty, can not be fixed. It still looks nice and pretty. But doen't work so it goes in the trash. don't waste your money. (BTW, I have a simple small grinder i have had for 20 years. It still works.)"
5,Best Grinder,"I had a burr grinder for years which went with ex-wife. Got a blde grinder and it simply didn't do the job right at all.The Cuisinart burr grinder is simple to use, very easy to clean, and grinds just the right amount for 2-12 cups. I use a french press sometime (coarse grind), a drip pot (medium grind), and occassionally expresso (fine grind). The grind is perfect each time. The price was right which made the choice a no-brainer."
1,owner,This is a piece of junk. It never worked either with me or with my son to whom I gifted it. I am really surprised that Amazon does not have any quality control. They don't ckeck before shipping any refurbished products. I called Cusinart Customer Services and was informed that it was out of warranty. I told them that it was never used because it didn't work. It seems that Cusinart has a great way of dumping their sub-standard products because amazon can sell produts without any problems. I suggest you not to buy such products from cuisart through amazon. Save your money.
3,Wrong dimensions listed!,"It should be 11"" high x 5.5"" wide x 6.5"" deep. I was shocked to see how big it is. (The product dimensions listed for this product ar 4x4x7.)"
5,Great Grinder for the Money,I have used this grinder for a month and I am very pleased with the performance. The footprint is just right for my limited countertop space. The results from grinder are wonderful and my coffee has never tasted this good. I only make drip coffee at home so I cannot attest to the grind for espresso.
2,thought this would be a good buy,"I ordered a Fractory-Reconditioned Cuisinart Supreme Grind Automatic Coffee Burr Mill DDV-16FR. What a mistake that was! Relying on Cuisinart's high profile name for appliances, I felt this would be a smart purchase; however, after opening and trying to use it, it never worked one time. I have had numerous Cuisinart appliances, including the grinder I was replacing and was up to this point satisfied with their performance, albeit they never lasted as long as I thought they should. I gave them benefit of doubt, though, with coffee makers and grinders because I used them more than the usual customer.I will not either buy nor use Cuisinart again."
1,A Dog,"I still have the original food processor model made by Cuisinart. With confidence in the brand, I purchased this burr coffee grinder. See first review for accurate product details. In addition, I have gone through three Cuisinart Grinders within a 6 month period. The grinder will work for a couple weeks to a month or so, then stop. In the past, Cuisinart has sent me a replacement. My third grinder was sent back to them about six weeks ago, and no replacement has been received. And frankly, I don't think I care. This is a piece of junk sold by Cuisinart. You would be better off buying a hammer."
3,"Adequate for coffee, not so great for espresso","I bought this for my brother so he didn't have to use his whirly-bird grinder for making espresso. After reading a few other reviews, I was expecting the static cling of the coffee grounds and the rather loud operation. Neither one of those bothered me too much. When we set it up for the first time, it was unable to grind the beans fine enough for adequate espresso. After disassembling the top a bit and adding some small shims under the burrs, I was able to ""zero"" the grinder. (That's the fineness setting at which the burrs actually touch each other and make an even *LOUDER* noise). After that, setting it for something slightly coarser than the zero point it can grind consistent, adequate espresso."
5,I'm no gourmet but this thing works,"Since buying this item and after ""playing with it to get it right"" I've finally found something that let's me actually brew a cup of good coffee that I don't have to add anything to. I love it. Well worth it."
5,Rich and informative.,"This book was among the best I have read this year. I had no idea as to the atrocities committed in the Congo around the turn of the century until I picked up this book. While Hochschild goes into great lengths to expose King Leopold II and his horrible deeds, he still maintains great objectivity and examines WHY Leopold may have acted in the manner that he did. I would love for Hochschild to look more into Leopolds mistress Caroline. That is a book I would definetly pick up."
2,What about the Horror created by the natives?,"I find modern history writers somewhat incredible when they only write to Condemn one side over another. I find prevalent among history writers who write about America's Indians without examining the inhumane practices of these varrious tribes. To be fair I also want to know about the slavery, torture, killing and kidnapping these Congolese tribes perpetrated on each other. The constant condemnation the author intones gainst Leopold looses its flavor for me and actually has the opposite effect. This author is a guy with a singular point of view out to get those who created our modern societies. I condemn all torture, rape, killing and slavery..surely these Congolese were not living in the garden of Eden! They too, because they were human, had to be just like the Europeans. I despise politically motivated history writing... This book is such an example."
1,Silly pop culture history for horror hobbyists,"Silly book, silly title.This book was boring and uninteresting and the title sucks.King Leopold's Ghost blah blah blah. This is so childish. How old are we? 7?Forget this and buy The King Incorporated: Leopold the Second and the Congo byNeal Ascherson. Unlike this book, it is fun to read and it is what anyone interested in Leopold should read."
4,A must read for students of Africa,"Paints the picture of why even today Africa is lacking the institutions that could lead to a stable democracy and economic growth. The cold brutal efffects of such a cruel, inhumane and utterly injust conquest has left in the Dark Continent wounds that even in the 21st century remain open pores."
5,Necessary history,"This book is a vital resource for learning about the effects of racism and colonialism by Europeans, especially the Belgians. In the case of this book, the villains are Belgians and other special citizens allied to Leopold and his economic interests. Rothschild performs a great services to the Congolese and to all who call themselves humanitarians. Their is far too little information about individual Congolese and other Africans, but Hochschild's Afterword explains why this is so -- and why that missing documentation is part of the heart of his book."
5,school,this i had only bought to be for one of my classes and when i had got it i thought it was in good
5,A True Story of Incredibly Shocking Evil,King Leopold's Ghost was a very well written true account of a very diabolical man. This book should be read by all races and a documentary should be made. It is truly a failing of all man kind to exploit others for profit. The atrocities in this book will make you want to cry (and you should) but the heroics of the people that exposed this brutality will make you see that even one person that truly believes in a cause can make a difference. Please read this account of the rape of the Congo and its people.
5,Exploring the congo,"I read this as a follow up to To End All Wars.Same characters appear in both.I loved this book especially because I knew nothing but the name of Leopold before.In the end, you realize, it doesn't take much to be king.Also, E.D. Morel, who appears in both books, I've come to feel from reading this, is a saint. He and several others show tremendous dedication and courage in exposing the horror."
5,Horrifying book that everyone should read!,"Africa has never been a stranger to horrible human rights violation, but in the late 1880s, King Leopold of Belgium brought forth a level of bloodshed and cruelty rarely seen before or since. He enslaved virtually an entire country, pillaged their natural resources and building a wealth scarcely imaginable. All this was done in the name of progress and building civilizations. These acts set the stage for some of the hate and anger that those in Africa still feel today towards Europe or the west in general. To not understand their past is to not understand their heritage which will never allow us to fully appreciate their view of the west. A powerful read by Adam Hochschild, a story that should be read by all, as Africa is still a troubled area with anarchy and piracy in a few areas which is reeking havoc in shipping lanes and other countries.My full review of this book is located on my blog which is linked in the very first comment located below. THank you"
2,"A great book, in an awful Kindle edition","Too bad publishers - even serious and otherwise reliable ones - don't treat Kindle customers with the same respect as they do buyers of printed books. This Kindle version, as pointed out by another reviewer, is full of mistakes, formatting issues, and lacks many of the features of the print edition.I also hope Amazon will make sure that Kindle books - especially full-price ones - are free of mistakes in the future. Unfortunately, these are still way too common.I'll be glad to remove this unfavorable review as soon as the problem is corrected, as Adam Hochschild's book is excellent, and deserves the best possible edition in any format."
4,History is not always written by the victors.,"Books dealing with a broad topic such as colonialism are difficult to get right. Hochschild comes close. By concentrating on one man, King Leopold, he puts a face on the driving force of evil greed that was the Belgian Congo policy. He was right to point out that Leopolds deeds were sadly not unique. While reading the book it was easy to be lulled into a feeling of ""Oh long ago those Belgians were bad to the Africans."" Thankfully the author recounts the recent policy of the USA in dealing with the kleptocrat Mobutu and one realises to parphrase the late Congressman Bono ""...and the beat goes on... """
3,A Great Eye-Opener,"Hochschild really opened my eyes about the tragedy in the Belgian Congo, and for that I'm very thankful I was introduced to(well, made to read actually) :) this book. Hochschild puts a very personal face on the Congo but it seems a bit shallow. It's filled with facts, but it doesn't seem to encompass the whole picture. It's definately not the ""tell all, end all"" on the subject. This is a good read, filled with biographies, but it is just a start."
3,Congo's Late 1800s History Through the Eyes of European,"The author's claim of a lack of primary sources (African writers) is somewhat disingenuous considering that quite a number of Africans (albeit educated by Europeans) DID write about the atrocities in the Congo. Other than that fairly huge flaw, the book itself was written quite lucidly and understandable. Especially cogent was the author's disgrace of the worse-than-racism world view almost everyone had in the turn of the century. Ignorance is never an excuse (especially when the Europeans thought they were educated)"
2,Congo deserves better,"Although Adam Hochschild's work is admirable it is not the masterpiece it is made out to be. In fact the author's holier-than-thou attitude and his un-nuanced view of foreign affairs in the late Nineteenth Century, makes his book an irritating read. Irritating because the Congo deserves better: with so much horror and so much bloodshed, the author really did not have to pepper his literature with his own chewed out opinions. He should have let the facts and the stories speak for themselves. Additionally, he should have taken more time to fit the Congo into its historical perspective. Narrative history should show some balance, this book doesn't."
3,A College Book!,"Great book, except with lots of details. I had to read this for college, so we got into most of the details, but it's a good book for insight into world history and slavery. Read this if you want to learn history in a casual and non-boring way!"
2,Unrealized potential,"This could have been a very good book -- an historical exploration of a little-known era and series of events in Africa. The author certainly did enough research to craft such a tale, and in spots the narrative is quite interesting. However, the author simply cannot stop trying to wedge this story into a politically correct fable without any real justification for doing so and keeps dragging in irrelevant things he admires -- Amnesty International, pacificists in WWI, etc. Well, it doesn't work and all this does is gradually undercut the author's credibility and make the reader suspicious of the other parts...Too bad, it could have been much better."
4,Detailed Readable History,"Positives:Detailed, readable history about Belgium's Scramble for Africa in the Congo. Hochschild does an excellent job of introducing key figures who aid King Leopold in getting 'his colony' in Africa as well as those who fought against the Belgian King's enslavement of the Congolese people. In addition, Hochschild intersperses the general experience of the colonizers and the Congolese with personal stories from sadistic colonizers, missionaries, the King's lobbyists, and most critically, some of the 10 million people devastated by King Leopold II's obsession.Negatives:Hochschild often distracts from the history he is so effectively telling through tangential introductions of more contemporary history and through personal analysis of historical events being presented. His personal analysis interrupts the pace of the history being told, and causes suspiscion about how the author chose to use the facts he researched."
4,"A Dark, Shameful Chapter","Few better descriptions of rapacious colonialism, genocide, and vicious hypocrisy exist. The text provides a lucid account of a shameful chapter in human history. It should be read by all who think civilisation unblemished."
4,The cunning manipulator,"Any reader will be able to tell what horrified me. What fascinated me was the description of Leopold II's cunning manipulation of his own image. He bamboozled diplomats, most journalists, and the public in Europe and the U.S. His downfall (not that he really had much of one) or rather the downfall of his reputation came from a few journalists some Protestant missionaries. Hochschild bluntly points out that the Belgians in WW I managed to generate stories of German atrocities commited against them that largely never happened but were precisely what they had inflicted on the Congolese. Do I have a complaint? Yes , I would like more photographs (and the ones in the poorl bound edition I have are falling out)."
1,Liberal bias ruined this for me,"When I began reading this, I detected a leftist bias and lack of scholarship. I checked the authors bio when I got fed up with his slant and assumptions and I wasn't surprised to see that he is a journalism professor at Cal-Berkley. Pass on this if you want an objective view of Belgian colonialism in the Congo."
4,Colonial African atrocities revealed.,"This book was a total learning experience for myself. The interesting history of colonial Africa was totally unknown to me. My only prior knowledge of the Congo was that at one point it was a Belgian possession that had been troubled by some human rights problems. I can't believe that the story of the Congo and its atrocities had escaped my education to this point in my life. King Leopold's Ghost has been an inspiring book, driving me to read more about colonial Africa."
4,Pretty good,"I recently read this book for a World History course and was surprised when I actually found the book interesting. The book reads like a novel but a novel with historically accurate information. For someone with little to no background information on the subject matter explored in the book, I have no hesitation when I say it was thoroughly enjoyable and (gasp!) informative at the same time. This book is a testament to the fact that not all books that contain historically accurate information have to be like a typical boring history textbook."
3,"Well-written and interesting, but oh so biased.","This is a really good book, make no mistake about it. People should learn about dark periods in our history. Europeans really did screw over the Africans. Still, the author goes a little too far in demonizing the villian, King Leopold. He also makes a more than a few suppositions --""it's safe to assume Mr. X passed by Mr. Y,"" or ""the King might have been thinking this""-- that really have no place in a history book. I would have preferred more fact, more political context. The history here can stand on its own merits and still show this time for what it was, horrible exploitation."
3,"Nothing new, now or then","The author did exhaustive research and presents it well organised. But: he has an axe to grind, and he grinds it time and time again until it wears thin.Instead of balanced history, it becomes a one-sided polemic.Reader beware!"
5,Required reading for anyone wanting to understand modern-day Congo,"This book and Michela Wong's ""In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz"" is required reading for anyone with an inkling of curosity as to why the DRC is in the shape it's in today. It was recommended to me by the AF Desk Officer at the State Department prior to my assignment to Kinshasa in the fall of 2007. I picked it up on a Saturday afternoon and by the following Friday I finished it and then went back and reread several of the chapters, and subsequently reread the entire book half-way through my tour in 2008. I considered it my good fortune to have served in the Congo, and this book more than any other helped me to understand that throughout it's history, with the brutality visited upon it by King Leopold and all the things that subsequently happened with Mobutu; the Congo, the Congolese, never had a chance."
5,Little known history,"Having served in the Congo in the l960's,I was especially amazed to know that no onefrom our missionary service spoke of the genocide and cruelty inflicted on the people of Congo during the previous 80 years under King Leopold II and the Belgian colonizers. It is not a part of history included in world history studies so far as I know. I recommend this book for all students of history so that this ""blank"" period of terror upon Congo is well known."
4,Vidal Sassoon VS432C 1.5,I have not had a hot air brush before. I like the plastic tips on the air brush. I was used to the Helen of Troy curling brush with the plastic tips. I like both products and am getting used to the Vidal Sassoon and think I will really enjoy this product. I understand this product lasts longer than the Helen of Troy which only seems to last for about a year before the tip comes off and you can't glue it back on.
2,Don't like the size,I don't like the large brush. Could I exchange it for the smaller size brush? I would love it if the brush was smaller. Other wise I is great!Annie
4,Perfect for long thick stubborn hair,I love this product. I have long thick hair and this is tool is the only one with teeth long enough to fit through it. Plus the teeth are hard verses soft bristles that just bend and don't grab the hair. My only complaint is it only last about a year. I have to buy one every year.
5,hair care,"I go through a lot of hair dryers and curling irons, when I couldn't find The Vidal Sasson model I could not get my hair to respond and it took forever to dry. I am so pleased to have found this product at the Amazon store. Most stores do not handle this brand any longer. Great product!"
1,Vidal Sassoon VS432C 1.15 inch,Very disappointed I plugged it in and it did not work.Was the right size product just defective. It Looked NEW!!!
5,An Overlooked Classic,"If you like cool music, hot cars and hot women (Salma!) this is the film for you! Great Hi-def picture quality. Bonus featurette is pretty cool too. Glad to see this movie get a proper Blu-ray release. Now if they would only release the amazing soundtrack for this film..."
5,Greasy rockabilly flick with a killer soundtrack!,"This is truly one othe greatest rockabilly 50's type films that I have ever seen. A monster soundtrack featuring Hasil Adkins, Charlie Feathers and Johnny Reno. David Arquette plays the perfect greaser and Selma Hayek is the perfect gal! Mean ol' cops and plenty of 50's style gang motif will draw all of the cats out of the barn!"
4,Screechin' rubber & Rockabilly!,"This is a killer flick that has David Arquette set as a rockabilly tough guy. His performance is great! He does an awesome job as a 50's greaser icon and looks the part! Selma Hayek plays his sensual Mexican girlfriend.The movie has a weird atmosphere, where you know it's supposed to be the 50's, but the styling is a bit weak. Especially weak is the arch enemy, who has long greased hair!!! Overall a really cool movie, Robert Rodriguez's 1st movie after El Mariachi. Cool to see what he did with 13 days and a 1 million dollar budget!"
3,Roadracers,"Well, this actually is a good movie. However, as is the style these days, it gets progressively more and more bazaar as it goes along until you wonder why you rented it."
2,really unhelpful...,"I just took (and passed!) the adult AANP computer based certification test...and I feel compelled to write a review of this study guide: the questions in this book did not reflect, in any way, questions on the exam. Even worse, the questions in the book were so esoteric and difficult, it almost lead me to believe I didn't at all prepare well enough...when in fact I had. I highly recommend the ""ANP cert. review"" book by Zerwekh, Claborn and Carter (Eds.)...it closely resembles the AANP adult exam, and was an excellent guide in terms of letting me know what areas I needed to study more, and which areas I was well versed in."
2,Disappointing,"I am reading this book and I have to agree with the first reviewer completely. Much of the figure legends is duplicated in the text and it is hard reading with the references inserted in the text. You have to go back to see what the beginning of the sentence was. I live in southern New Mexico and have seen some of the sites and petroglyphs that are mentioned but in other cases of where these site are, I am just as much in the dark as anyone else. Three Rivers and Hueco Tanks are open to the public and both are great places to visit. In fact, I want to go back to Three Rivers again to find some of the petroglyphs that are pictured. Dennis Slifer's book is much easier and more enjoyable reading. He is also vague on site location but does offer a list of public access places in the last chapter which gives you much of explore."
4,Multi-Phone Line surge Protector,"Installed the Panamax module for a small business phone system to protect internal equipment(PBX, phones, etc) from phone-line voltage-spikes. Installs easily, hardware included. I would recommend this unit for the home or office analog phone system. Also, be sure to ground the module properly, to ensure that it will work as specified."
4,Coming Out on Top,"Laughing in the Dark was a phenomenal, well-written book. Patrice went through many trials and tribulations in her life and managed to make it despite her many struggles. This book is not only exciting, but it provides very good advice. She talks about her experiences with men, drugs, pregnancy, death and many other things. By reading what she said, many women should know how to deal with life decisions without a doubt in their mind that most of their choices are right. I think that her best message to women is to stay strong; love and respect yourself before you jump into relationships, and you're more likely to come out on top--like Patrice."
5,A very realistic book,"I throughly enjoyed this book. It was nice to read from an author who talked about how she struggled in life and even went to jail before getting her head straight, as well as her failures and mistakes. I think Gaines is a very good author and this book was very well-written. I love it. It's one of my favorites."
4,Divinely Reviewed,"Laughing in the Dark was a testament of resilience and strength in overcoming poor decisions, horrific assaults and personal tragedies. The author bared her soul in sharing her story which detailed a life of abandonment, low self-esteem, desparation and crime. Fortunately, she began the healing process, made some changes and started the journey to power."
4,An amazing story,"Patrice Gaines-an amazing woman who has gone through almost everything you could think of. Laughing in the Dark is an amazing autobiography. I would recommend this book to anyone that is going through trouble in life; this book is could give them a better understanding of what they are going through because people can't see what is happening to themselves, but when they see another person going through they can understand it better. Not only do I recommend it to those with troubled lives but anyone that likes to read what is going on in the world with someone besides themselves. This book is amazing and I could read it over and over again and not get sick of it. So read it."
4,"""This One's for John (too!, er, ah, two!)"" - Calgary's Pat Bolen","A very good NFL films video about BigJohn, the greatest QB of alltime, andthe Broncos winning a second Super Bowlin a row. Way to go John. And a SuperBowl win over Mr Conservative Offece,Dan Reeves, who was the main reasonDenver lost those first three! Danwas a very good Coach however, as his201 wins attest to. He joins Marv Levyand Bud Grant, a couple outstanding ex-CFL Coaches who lost four Super Bowls."
3,Not a good Super Bowl to work with.,"This was a hard movie to make. They didnt have a heart-stopper Super Bowl to work off of, so they couldnt do anything. They did the best they could."
5,We waited a Long Time For This.,"As a sincere and longstanding Bronco fan It is really a wonderful felling to have finally WON IT ALL. Not one time but, BACK TO BACK. I only wish that we could have played the Vikings...... I will love this video just as much as the 1998 video. GO Broncos! One More Time Butterfly of Denver"
5,THE LURE OF CAPRI - from Italy with Love,"The descriptions of the island of Capri and surrounding areas made me want to get on a plane and see them for myself.The story is of a lost love, or is it fantasy? DiAnn weaves a tale of fantasy and reality as a young woman looks for her true love. She grows in her faith and sees how she needs to turn her life over to God and strive to live in His will and for Him. Then her life will finally be on track."
4,Excellent Orator at least,"I have NOT read this book, unfortunately, so I can not comment on it. But since there were no reviews here yet, I thought this comment might be helpful to potential readers. I just attended a wonderful talk/question and answer session given by the author, who is certainly one of the most charismatic, intelligent, and well-spoken speakers I have heard. He painted a well-rounded and vibrant portrait of Islam to a non-Muslim crowd and answered two hours of questions about the Muslim-American view of September 11th with extraordinary deftness. I am ordering this book now and will hopefully update this review after I have read it."
1,Innacurate description,"This book may be good for some, however it is misleading in the description. I was led to beleive that this book was in fact comic book coversations to help explain simple situations to my child with Autism. Instead, you have to write your own comic strips to do the explaining. Not worth the book in my opinion if it is still up to me to do all the work, I already do that without this book."
1,Awful. Just Awful. I wish I had followed the other recommendation to avoid this book. Waste of money : (,"This book has like 10 pages and basically tells you what a cartoon bubble is and how to draw a comic strip (if you have the intelligence of a 4 yr old, you already know this information). Save your money. I wouldn't pay 10 cents for this in a store and I guarantee you that you wouldn't either if you saw it before you bought it."
2,Very Short and Very Specialized,"In my opinion, this is probably most suited for the most severe cases, but the book is short and cheap."
5,This method increases understanding.,"An ingenious, insightful, and effective method of improving understanding for all participants in the Comic Strip Conversation."
5,"Fox Run 10-Inch Whitle Paper Lace Doilies, Pack of 12","I have been looking for some simple paper doilies but couldn't find them in the stores, so I decided to check on Amazon! Once again, Amazon came through! These are exactly what I was looking for--simple paper doilies to line plates or platters when serving home-made cookies and candy during the holidays. These are perfect."
1,Too expensive,This product is very flimsy and way too expensive for what it is. I was disappointed to say the least.
5,Buy it. Read it. Give it to friends.,"I first heard of Vea and his new novel on the Marc Cooper show on Pacifica Radio KPFK (90.7). The show inspired me to seek out his new novel. I finished it last weekend and am still carrying its power with me. To describe ""gods go begging"" as an example of a war novel or a Vietnam novel or a Chicano novel or a magic realist novel does not do full justice to the book. It is all of those and much, much more. Vea has succeeded in telling a story that I have never heard before and telling it in such a way that, to quote the last line of Frank O'Connor's classic short story, ""Guests of the Nation"": ""And anything that ever happened me after that I never felt the same about again.""Buy it. Read it. Give it to friends."
2,The Music is not that Great!,I am expecting a full house orchestra... but to my dismay.. a full organ arrangement... such a shame.. Anrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice was used... but it turned out to be a simple organ arrangement...Theres's no choice but to enjoy the music...
4,Hottest Love Making Scene,"When i first watching this movie, i didn't expect much but after viewing several minutes i was wrong. Its entertained me a lot anyway and i infact the fan of the leading actors. I know "" Stacey Dash "" from Clueles oposite to Alicia Silverstone, and the other leading actor in this sexy steamy movie "" Dan Gauthier "" from series Melrose Place and Beverly Hills. They both gorgeous and hot match.There are several sex scenes, the last one with Dash & Gauthier is one of the hottest love scene i've ever seen ( get the unrated version ). It should be released on DVD format soon. I will wait for it.........."
2,The action is not here,"If you're looking for a great TTF volume, 17 is definitely not it. There is hardly a track that stands out. My personal recommendation is that you spend your money on the latest volumes, like 21, which is excellent."
5,the earlier the better with this guy,"I like this CD even better than ""Lie to Me"", his excellent ""debut"" - actually this CD predates ""Lie to Me"" by 1 year. These first 2 CD's seem to be the only ones that are more the bluesy virtuoso guitarist I keep hearing about. The later 4 albums - I've only listened to on-line snippets of them however - seem to have really pedestrian boring stuff on them without the guitar work I crave. I tend to believe the more critical reviews of his later 4 albums and from those reviews and the on-line snippets, I won't be buying those. I keep hearing how good he is to see live - I've never seen him live, but I plan to and when I do, if he sounds like the on-line clips from the last albums, I'll probably walk out. He needs to go back to the blues."
3,Better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick,"This is not Jonny Lang at his best -- his best is probably mostly available when you see him in person. At very nearly his best on his album Lie to Me, Jonny is backed by absolutely masterful musicians while playing fantastic arrangements.That said, this album of Jonny in his younger days is still better than most of what is coming onto the market these days. Smokin' is enjoyable listening, if nothing else. If you're like me, you'll be happy just to have some new tunes to listen to. If Jonny continues to improve and mature as a blues artist, as I expect he will, anyone who buys this album will be glad to have a piece of his history in the making."
4,Good CD,"This item arrived with a crack on the case but the cd inside was is excellent condition. Overall, I would recommend this to another buyer."
1,"When ""New Age"" meets modern martial arts...","This a typical result of ""impressionistic"" research, that is the one not backed with facts and documents, but rather full of stuff that long fell out of fashion: urban legends about martial arts tricks coupled with ""new-age"" ad hoc explanations for everything as ""coming out of the same source."" A careful reader will note this pastiche right away. And if there is any reason to buy this book at all, is to make it a museum piece in the section dedicated to post-hippie follies."
1,Scratching under the cover,"Bodhisattva Warriors is meant to be authorative on the Buddhist Martial Art in China. Recent investigations however into the background of the author, Shifu Nagaboshi, cast doubt on his religious and martial arts credentials. Furthermore, there are various pictures, photographs and paragraphs in the book that are clearly taken from other, secondary sources without those being properly acknowledged. This book contains interesting passages on the Buddhist Yogacara view of the mind, but should be discarded by those interested in martial arts history."
3,Old stuff!,"I agree with a fan from Texas. I want to listen to new songs, not recycled songs.. I gave this album 3 stars because they are beautiful pieces, anyway. Hope he will come up with new material soon since I start to think I've seen too many Yanni old albums already. That's why I bought this album on tape, not CD."
3,Not her best book,I have read almost all of Patti Callahan Henry's books. I have enjoyed them all including Losing the Moon. It's was slow and predictable. Not my favorite of her collection but worth reading.
2,Not my cup of tea,"Reading is my favorite past time, but when I devote that time to a book, I expect to be entertained, learn something, find pleasure with the characters, and get a believable plot. I did not find any of these things in Losing the Moon. The author is a fine writer, but it takes more than good writing to make a good story. Some may enjoy how she handled the return of the old college boy friend some twenty years later and how that upset the life of the main female character. Did she not mature any during that period of time? Also I found the meeting unbelievable--not likely to happen in the close setting of the story. I didn't like the characters, nor the plot, not the way it dragged so heavily in the middle. Sorry, can't recommend this one."
3,Liked it!,"Why does the woman always have to be the practicle one? When you find your soul mate...the great love of your life...even though years have passed....shouldn't you be able to have that great love again? This is the story and the delima. I would take the side that if you rediscover that love, you should be able to finish out your life with that person. I liked the book and it was predictable."
2,not my type,"There are 2 reasons I bought the book: (1) the author is living in the suburban city next to my residence. (2) I had a thought of a similar storyline when I was writing some novels (for myself) in high school--- what if my kid dates my ex-girlfriend's kid. The language used in the book is nice, but I am sorry to say the plot is mediocre, quite disappointing me."
3,Disappointing Overall,"Great story, but unsophistocated writing style. The plot is very ""real life"" and thought provoking, but the writing is repetitive and a little too dramatic for my taste."
3,Infuriating characters,"I am only giving this book 3 stars, however, it is not a reflection on Ms. Henry's writing.I just found the Amy and Nick character's so selfish and immature in their behaviour that they were mildly unlikeable. I wanted to give them both a good hard shake and say why are you behaving like such fools?Of course, I realize thats the whole point of the story.:-) I just found it maddening. Like when you watch a scary movie and the heroine goes looking for the scary noice and your screaming - no, thats stupid, why would you go in there? Run away!Also - I thought it was a bit long in the middle building to the crisis.But Ms. Henry is a good writer and uses lovely language. And she builds her world very well."
2,Fishing,This book was written by my Grandfather and dedicted to my mother. I got it as a gift for my oldest son who now lives and fishes in the rivere that Grandpa did in McMinnville Oregon. It was stated as a first edition singed by the auther. By the time my son opened it on his birthday he found that it was not signed anywhere. Very disapointed.The book is good as always but.......this is why I gave the store 2 star the book is 5 stars.
2,Two stars for Vampira.,"The two stars are for the awesome track Vampira, the rest of the album is filler."
5,Absolutely amazing - one of DT's best,"This has to be the one of the most beautiful, happy, sad, epic and yet still heavy albums of all time. I would rank this as a tie with Accelerated Evolution as Mr. Townsend's crowning career achievement... there are simply no words to describe the amazingness of this album. If you are new to Devin Townsend (or at least his ""happy"" side), THIS is the place to start. Before hearing this album I didn't think it was possible to create an album so incredibly loaded with MELODY! The lush waves of powerful vocals, guitar, bass, strings/synth, piano, random banjos, and ten billion vocal harmonies make the songs so thick with melody that the music becomes a solid substance that you feel like you have to part it with your hands in order to move forward!! And there's not A SINGLE dull moment on this album! Simply phenomenal... like I said before, this has to be the most incredibly happy, powerful, emotional album ever... Long live the Dev!!"
5,Synchestra - Oh Yeah,"Devin just never seems to run out of ideas. All of his albums to date have been packed to the brim with very memorable, singable vocal melodies, yet still containing the heavy element which many of us have come to love. Synchestra is no exception. The album strikes a perfect balance between the melodies and the heaviness.Stylistically, it is very similar to Terria, containing some very chilled out, melancholy pieces. And of course, it is full of the sort of humour we can expect from Devin.Finally, the bouns DVD is weel worth the money. It contains tracks from most of Devin's previous solo albums, all recorded with the band in the studio. This is a must for any hardcore Devin fan."
3,You just wait and wait...,"For something - anything in this album to grab you and make you listen. Unfortunately it never happens as none of the songs are real ear pleasers. My background on Devin is based off of three pieces of work - ""Accelerated Evolution"", ""Terria"" and ""Ocean Machine"". Those albums just flat out rock(see my review for ""Terria""). I've listened to this album and I just can't get into it. Sure the multi-layering i.e noise wall is there but none of the songs ever grab you. I would recommend purchasing any of the three albums listed above, but steer clear of this album."
5,The MUST HAVE D.T. Album,"Synchestra was my introduction to Devin Townsend. I first heard a short 2 minute sample of the Track ""Triumph"" and my jaw just dropped to the floor. WOW!!!!!! That ROCCCKKKS. My first glimpse of Devin was of a Video with Steve Vai years ago when the band was just known as Vai, and I immediately wasn't interested to say the least. I have since purchased all of Devin's other albums but have yet to taste Strapping Young Lad as I believe that is a lot heavier. ""Vampira"" is another awesome Rocker, but this song has to be seen on Video (Check out YOU TUBE to see it) Absolutely hilarious. Other stand-out Rockers are ""Gaia"" and ""Notes from Africa"". I can highly recommend to any one curious about the music of Devin Townsend, BUY THIS ALBUM first, and like me, you will eventually have to delve into his other albums at a later stage. Highly highly recommended Masterpiece with a touch of everything."
5,I woe for B&B's Pain,"Cool! Another well thought up Video on the Best of Beavis and Butthead. My favorite was ""Blood Pressure"". I give it an A+. I don't understand why they added ""Animation Sucks"", though. It's probably because B&B's cartoon characters were dieing or that they had a struggle with the project. I still give it an A, though because of it's awesome humor. ""Bad Dog"" was a classic episode in my opinion."
3,wagon not for babies learning to walk,"I gave it three stars because the product is solidly constructed and is what it seems in the pictures. However, the lack of brakes and the slippery, plastic wheels make it utterly unsuitable for babies just learning to walk. My 10-month-old daughter would lean on it and fall down because the wagon would just slip away from under her. The light weight of the wagon doesn't help either. The blocks are much smaller than they look in the pictures, but they are actually OK for baby to play with. If I can figure out a way to add rubber around the wheels and add more weight to it, this wagon may yet prove useful."
3,Missing Parts,"My husband and I were excited to give this to our granddaughter for Christmas. However, as he started to assemble it on Christmas Eve, we noticed that the hubcaps were missing . This was to be her big Christmas gift so he proceeded to assemble it, despite the missing parts. We were quite disappointed that this did not arrive as pictured! Now, it will be very difficult to disassemble the hub nut from the axle in order to put the white hubcaps on . I'd like to request a whole new Walker Wagon with Blocks."
5,Perfect Push Toy for Toddlers!,"We bought this for my grandson's 1st birthday, and he loves pushing it around as well as getting in and going for a ride in it. He likes putting the blocks in and taking them out. The blocks are a made of a dense spongy-type material. He chews on these, and it does concern me that he will eventually be able to bite a small piece off. So for now, we will put the blocks away until he gets older. Other than that, we are very happy. It's very sturdy and he really enjoys playing with it all the time."
2,City Folk,"It's quite clear she isn't comfortable with the people of Mojave. She thinks everyone in Mojave has a crystal meth lab in their basement. Many people are erroneously called ""tweakers"" and the locals are portrayed as small-town idiots.There are simple errors in the book like getting the name of highways and local organizations wrong. These might be the kind of errors one might make in casual conversation, but not in a book one supposedly spent years writing.There are also errors of omission. For example, the BMW Gary Hudson drives around in, was paid for by money Gary Hudson received from his selling the movie rights of his life and this book to a studio. It's a good example of how the process of observing can alter what is being observed."
2,For Those Who Love Frustration,"As I was reading this, I noticed a pattern for Gary Hudson :Start a rocket company, hype it, get money, fail;Repeat as needed (maybe Gary Hudson NEEDED to?).I found the ""smoking gun"", however, in a very telling passage, where Gary laments that he wasted all of these years on trying to make rockets for the dreams he had of space travel, and that he was led astray by a book, ""Profiles of the Future"", by arthur C. CLarke.Now, I thumbed open my own well-read copy of ""Profiles"", and here is what I read :""It is an act of faith among science-fiction writers, and an increasing number of people in the astronautics business, that there must be some safer, quieter, cheaper, and generally less messy way of getting to the planets than rockets.""Next time, Gary READ THE BOOK (""Profiles""), OK?"
4,Great Fun,My grandson and I love Shaun the Sheep and Wallace and Gromit.I have nothing else to say. So many words need not be required.
5,Great for the Whole Family,Our family loves Shaun the sheep. This DVD while appropriate for almost all ages would probably appeal most to children 3 and up. Timmy Time an offshoot of Shaun the Sheep is also great for kids.
4,Slightly dissapointed,"This is not as good as the episodes on Netflix. Something was lost. For example, the redesign of the characters can be overlooked, but it never feels right. In the first season, the characters actions did not seem evil, but in these episodes some of Shaun's actions are mean. Why does the old lady have to repeatedly beat the pigs?"
5,STILL GOOD,THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT BUT THEY NEED TO GET THIS RIGHT HERE>>>>>ASPRE RASAGE<<<<<<. THATS THE REAL FRAGRANCE OF DRAKKOR
4,Still smells good to me.,"I bought a bottle of this way back in the day loved it then, love it now. I gather from some stuff I've read online that some consider it a dated, eighties ""lounge lizard"" type scent but it still smells great I think."
1,not original,"el perfume que compre no es original, ademas por el precio lo hubiese comprado en cualquier otra tienda. algunas veces compro en esta tienda pero debido a esta experiencia voy a dejar de hacerlo, a veces lo barato sale caro."
4,"Good Stuff, But I Wanted More","The quality of the job hunting stuff in the High Tech Survival Guide is good stuff, and I learned a lot--cold emailing, avoiding human resources, being a blabbermouth--that those other career books don't tell you. But, I wanted more. What about interviewing skills? Resume writing? Or other stuff? I guess he figures that those big scary career books talk about that stuff, he might as well concentrate on the stuff he knows best. All in all, a lot better than those 300-pagers. I'd recommend it to friends."
5,Great job hunt guide,"Frustrated with my job search, I went seeking some sort of guide book to help me out. I checked out Amazon and found this gem! ""The High Tech Survival Guide"" cuts to the chase. It has given me great tips and hints that are currently saving me time and effort in my search. I especially like the phone techiniques and how-to examples that the author provides. After ten days of applying what I learned from this book, I have spoken with 2 hiring managers and have an interview next week!"

1,It's OK,"This magnifier is ok. I purchased it for my mother who has a degenerative eye condition that she needs to use this all the time to read the newspaper, tv guide, etc. The main downside to this magnifier is that you have to keep the magnifier directly touching the page or else the text appears upside down. For someone who has trouble with coordination, this presents quite a problem. It is very awkward to use unless you are sitting at a table with a hard surface to lay the newspaper or book on. Another disadvantage of this magnifier is that it is very small - about 1.5 inches across. This is a very small circumfrance and makes it more awkward to use - especially when you have to keep this on the page. I ended up returning the item."
5,Educate Yourself Now,"This book is AWESOME.Just buy it now and take control of your music, your label, and your business.Thanks Michael for your desire to share your wisdom and experiences."
3,Could Have been Better.,I would say the author failed in presenting the case for a radical change in our cultural values. He had made some siggestions here and there. Also the fact that the notes are not formatted for kindle is a big inconvenience while reading on Kindle.
3,Reads more like a term paper,"Before reading this book, I read ""The Paradox of Choice : Why More Is Less"" by Barry Schwartz. I thought this book would take things to another level over that book. I ended up very disappointed.This book discusses studies that Kasser has been involved in. While some of the studies were interesting, I felt like I was reading a scientific journal rather than the unique way that Schwartz presented his material. This book would have better been titled ""Why Materialism will not make you happy"".The Schwartz book is a very interesting and thought provoking read. This book is more like a dry term paper, 3 stars was stretching it for me."
2,Dry and academic,"The two stars are because the author DOES prove his point. However, I had hoped for an interesting read as well, and didn't get it. It reads like a scientific study by a graduate student. What a pity it wasn't written for the general public, because we all need his messsage!"
5,Academic but Engaging,"I have to disagree with the reader from the Canary Islands. This book is an academic account about this important topic, but is anything but dry. For anyone wondering why feelings of alienation are so pervasive in our society, this book has the answer. Kasser's final chapter on ""Making Change"" is a gem."
4,Good bag for old glass-lined thermoses,"I don't drink wine, but was looking for a bag to protect my antique Landers, Frary & Clark glass-lined thermos bottles and this bag is just what I was looking for. It's nicely padded and the carry strap and carry handle both serve my purposes well. I hook the strap over the passenger-side head rest and my thermos sits upright on the passenger seat so I can get my thermos out easily enough to pour a cup of coffee at a red light and get my thermos nestled back in the bag before the light turns green. I imagine its great for keeping two bottles of wine cool too. It's very well made and I expect years of happy use. I've bought two of them because I liked the first one so well and an all-day trip to town is a two-thermos day for me."
4,Dual purpose for me,"I bought this to carry two glass VOSS water bottles to work with me each day. The water at work is chlorinated so I refill the glass bottles every day. The case is nice. It is perfectly sized for these water bottles. It is not top-shelf in terms of quality - the faux leather is a little cheesy and the zipper is a bit awkward to close - but it was reasonably priced and it is insulated. The strap is nice and long and can be shortened if needed. I also like the carry handle on top. If you don't need the top of the line, this is a very nice bag to carry wine or water bottles."
2,Michelle,This product was not what I expected. It had a cheap plastic insulation instead of the sturdy thermo aluminum color insulation as pictured (the kind of lining in cooler bags you get at clubs like Sams or Costcos or BJ's to keep food cold). Also no wine stopper included as described. Not happy at all with this.
4,Unjustly Forgotten Classic,"This movie isn't without its faults -- find me one that isn't -- but as one of the earliest movies about a woman taking her life into her own hands, it stands as one of the all-time greats. Compare this to the much better known ""Thelma and Louise,"" in which two women, merely bored, take off on their own and wreak a path of destruction for no other purpose than to prove they can. By contrast, Shirley Knight's character is suffering real and believable angst for a concrete purpose, and actually does something about it. Even minor characters are three-dimensional, and it's interesting to see James Caan and Robert Duvall before they settle into the predictable stock roles that continue to dominate their careers. Watch the credits closely -- this was one of George Lucas' first movies."
4,Film School Students should watch this one.,"I saw this in 1971 on an outdoor screen in a Construction Camp in Northern Australia when I was 19. It made enough of an impression that I still remember it, although I've never seen it on TV since. Caan (Pre-Godfather) was good, the girl was OK, but Robert Duvall as a single parent Cop living in a trailer in some one-horse armpit town in Middle America was textbook perfect."
2,Would not recommend,"At first I was hooked to this book. Then less than halfway through something went wrong... Little lost it. The storyline is interesting- Greek mythology woven into a modern-day ""what if"" scenario, although I think it could have been written better.The way it's written felt almost amateurish; very choppy and not well thought out. Little definitely has a way for creating a scene, I will give him that, but a story needs to encompass much more than simply setting up an image, and that's where he lost it.One of the main things I really did not like, which made me lose interest VERY fast, was that the characters lose their realness and the dialogue between all of them becomes ridiculous and not believable. As the plot progresses the changes within their psyches are not well documented and it made me wonder whom I was suddenly reading about.My suggestion? If you can find a library that carries this book, borrow it before you buy."
3,Ending is disappointing,Kept my interest for the first two thirds of the book. The ending seemed to meander. Feel the book probably should have ended earlier.
1,Disappointing,"Unfortunately, I have become less and less of a Little fan, and Dominion helped to seal my opinion. While only a couple of Little's characters have any redeeming qualities, the others are depraved and act reprehensibly. I will not purchase another of Little's novels or short stories."
1,"Plays well into a sick, valueless society...","I am appalled at how many people raved about this book and called it awesome. It's scary to think about how Godless many in our society have become. I like thrillers, and I've liked many of Bentley Little's books, but I couldn't stand to read this book in its entirety. If you have no moral values and glory in plotless sex and violence, then this is the book for you. Link it to mythology if you want to, but does that give it legitimacy or literary merit? Crude is crude; gross is gross; and disgusting is disgusting no matter what else you call it."
1,Nasty!,"This book was too nasty for my taste... A little to much detail of things I'd rather not read in a so-called ""horror novel""... One of Bently Little's worst!"
3,Goes well with a RED!,"I just finished Dark Dominion {DOMINION} today and I really enjoyed it! Bentley is a writer unhampered by morals and freely depics a bloodsoaked and sexually charged environment that could quite easly unsettle those with good Christian values.Fortunatly I am not one of those people and found it an indulgent treat!I gave it 3 stars because its jumpy, by that I mean the story all of a sudden presents seriously unlikely or ill explained events, I wont go into it because I dont want to ruin it for you!If you get the chance and are ""indulgent"" in the sexy goresense of the word read it!It may not be the best novel in the world but it is enjoyable,discript and uninhibited."
4,Better read it - can't be made into motion picture,"I decided to take a break from my countless Lovecraft and Maberry for this novel.This was my first Bentley Little experience and it's quite an interesting, unique read.The first half of the book read like a cheap teenage thriller with overt sexual tendencies, then later became something that is unlike anything you will have ever read or seen. Interestingly, though the book is filled with extremely graphic sexual situations and taboo events, it all ties in nicely to the story. I have to commend Little on taking a minor story of greek mythos and turning into something large (no pun intended, though there should be).I'm also reading his Collection, as I like short stories for when at my cabin. I'm trying to decide on which of his full-length novels to read next though.Highly recommended for free-thinking readers!"
3,Like a B rated movie,"This book reminded me of one of those cheesy B rated horror movies from the 80's that has tons of teens, sex, nudity and gore. One of those horror films that is so bad, you can't stop watching.""Dominion"" started off good and promising, but kind of lost me 1/2 way through. Too many decriptions of everyone in town drinking wine and getting ""in the mood"", so to speak.I'm sure Bentley Little had fun writing this book, knowing he would shock and disgust a lot of people.The mythology tie-in plot was ok.This book is not for the faint of heart!"
3,Not the best Bentley Little I have read...,"I really enjoy most all of Little's books, but recently I picked this one up and it just didn't do it for me. I don't think I even enjoyed the plot much either. I highly recommend something else by Little like The Mailman. Little usually writes some good modern day creepers that make you look over your shoulder."
1,Not really a release by the Cuban timba band Bamboleo,"Buyers beware. I ordered this CD, thinking that it was by the Cuban dance music (timba) Bamboleo that is led by Lazaro Valdez. It turns out that it is collection of songs by different performers. Only one song is listed as performed by Bamboleo. I did not open the CD. So I do not know if the Bamboleo listed there is really the aforementioned Cuban band. But looking at the CD and names of the performers, I think that the CD is not even about Cuban dance music. None of the performers listed on the CD is known at all. Their names do not even look Cuban. None of the top Cuban dance bands is listed there. I returned the CD and asked Amazon to show an image of the CD and post the list of songs and performers on the CD, so customers can make an informed decision. I hope that they follow my suggestion."
1,Surprise!,"I bought this book on a whim. Being from the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania I was surprised to learn there was an epic poem about the 1790s Wyoming Massacre written in the early 19th century called Getrude of Wyoming. I looked on Amazon for it and found this book which was a classic reprint of the poem. It was a little expensive but I thought I would donate it to my public library. When I received the book I was impressed at the crisp clean binding and then I opened the book. The pages were blank. Well not completely blank some had printing them and some had partial printing on them but mainly blank. I contacted Amazon which gave me a full refund, so I'm statisfied. Just beware of the classic reprints in this series which touts it careful and faithful digital reproduction of classic work because it is obvious there is a real lack of quality control. How many Gertrude of Wyoming books could you possibly be producing that a blank copy slips through the cracks?"
5,A GOOD ONE,"first of all, to make things clear i must say this cologne is not for everyone and definitely not for the teens,I'm 24,and feel its too old for my age.But still i have to say that it has its uniqueness and for surely oneday i would love wearing this often.I have no idea how the other vetivers like tom ford grey vetiver is gonna be, but for the money you spend on this one,its worth it."
3,Jury Still Out,"I received the product very quickly, but the jury is still out on how I feel about the smell of the product. The smell reminds me of when I used to get a hair cut by this one person that would use talc at the end of the hair cut, not sure I like it. But, when I smell it later on a shirt that I have worn I enjoy the lingering scent."
1,Repel.,"This stuff smells like bug spray, like some of the other buyers have commented. Was really excited to get this smell, unfortunately my boyfriend won't be wearing it unless he plans on sleeping alone. You'd be better off spraying yourself with some Repel bug spray."
2,Try before you buy!,"This has great reviews in the fashion circles that cover fragrance, but to me, it smells like an ashtray. There are multiple layers to the scent, but it's mostly bad tobacco, and that's the one that just won't wear off.It's also very strong, so even if you love the smell, go really light with this one."
2,Classic? Yes. Timeless? No.,"I bought this because of all the great reviews on a fragrance site, and a sniff at the local Sephora. Unfortunately, the sexy fresh carrot-smelling top quickly disappears. The smell becomes very disturbing - stale cinnamon, stale tobacco, and fresh Raid bug spray.My people give me honest feedback about all of my fragrances. Here are five comments I received on this one:1. Dull.2. Smells like weed.3. Smells like trees. It's like sniffing the bark of a tree.4. Smells really old.5. I don't like it.I sold the bottle on eBay for 33 bucks. I've never been happier to lose 7 dollars.It is a classic, just like classical music - it's been around for years, and most people prefer something else."
1,Cheap Hair Spary,"I really wanted to like this cologne after reading so many great reviews on it. However, everytime I try to wear it all I can smell is a little old lady who put on way too much cheap hairspray. Not my cup of tea."
2,Long Lasting But Not Strong,"Love the smell, its unisex. Smell lasts longer on clothing than on skin. The smell strength on my skin is too low, it might work differently on your skin. Unlike me, always test before you buy. I will try Drakkar Noir next time."
2,Great fragrance that won't last,"This has been the only perfume I have purchased since my Senior Prom, more than 30 years ago. The fragrance is just terrific. Nothing compares to the fresh and sophisticated smell of it. Sadly the fragrance won't last. After using it couple of times the smell of Vetiver just vanishes and is quickly replaces by an alcoholized smell. So now I buy it for special occasions when I feel nostalgic about the brand new smell and it buy it in the smallest size possible. Sad that Guerlain has not improved the formula after so many years."
4,"Green, masculine, Vetiver","Vetiver Guerlain comes from one of the most famous perfume houses in the world, and is a reflection in classic tastes - not current trends. Lately, it seems that a lot of manufacturers are starting to use Vetiver more and more in their releases, as an example, Tom Ford has released (in 2010) a version called Grey Vetiver, which is has garnered a highly favorable reputation. I would not put Vetiver Guerlain up there with my all time favorites, but I purchased it to augment my current collection with something more historical and masculine. It has filled this niche quite well and I would suggest it to anyone looking to add a scent of Vetiver into their rotation but do not want to splurge on the more expensive Grey Vetiver from Tom Ford. The smell is musky, fresh and old (in a good way). It would remind women, that they are out with a man of taste with an appreciation for the clasics. As always, the larger 4.2 Oz size offers the best value."
3,not what i'd hoped,"As a fan of the one and only Arc Angels cd, I was hoping this would be a bit better. It's a bit mellow for my tastes, doesn't rock as hard as the Arc Angels. The energy of the Arc Angels just isn't here. The musicianship is commendable, and I have no plans to return the cd. Just will add to my short list of mellower tunes. Hope Charlie and Doyle will consider doing Arc Angels II."
5,"If you don't own Jelllycream, buy it today","I had never heard of DB2 before, and bought Jellycream after hearing I Wanna Be on the radio - I'm a sucker for a clever guitar riff. I LOVED the whole CD. It's rare to find a disc I can play end to end and dig every track - but this is one. He has a distinctive voice, an imaginative style of guitar playing, and what's not to like about a great songwriter? I bought the earlier self-titled CD and love it as well, although Jellycream is still my fave. In this age of overproduced lowest-common-denominator pop trash, this disc is a breath of fresh air."
5,"Terrific, Unique, A great listen","I first heard DB2 about three months ago when I stumbled upon the Double Trouble ""Been a Long Time"" cd. Being a huge SRV & DT fan, I bought it and immediately fell in love with Doyle, Malford Milligan and Charlie Sexton. I'm not sure why I never heard any of these guys before. (I feel a bit cheated.) But I am thrilled to know about them now. Each is unique and each is outstanding in his own way.Back to DB2. I now have Doyle Bramhall II, Jellycream, Welcome and the Arc Angels Double CD and DVD set. I won't pretend to be a critic or to try to analyze or compare. In my opinion, the song writing, quitar playing, and voice of Doyle II are all incredible. It makes me very happy to listen to this amazing artist. He makes the kind of music that is fresh each time you hear it. I enjoy everything he does and wish he would release another solo work.As for the Arc Angels - WOW! What fun! I would buy more of their stuff in a heart beat."
5,Great guitar / vocals / songwriting,"I first heard Doyle when he was in Arc Angels and was hooked on his guitar and vocals. I recently saw him perform live with his new band and I bought the CD the next day. Great songs, great vocals, great musicians(Lisa and Wendy and Charlie Drayton)combine for some music. The CD also features Charlie Sexton who also played guitar with Doyle in Arc Angels. This is one CD you must have in your collection, Excellent!"
3,"A solid, detailed study bordering on the tedious","This history of money is very thorough and detailed. There are good pages on Ancient Greece and Rome which are very interesting and rarely found in similar studies. Yet I found the book disappointing and rather pedestrian, hiding the forest behind the trees. It is very descriptive, with a lot of material about the development of banking regulations, which I found a bit boring. It's also very Anglo-centric: more than half the book is dedicated to British banking and monetary history.For a ""big picture"" yet very clear history of money, I found Galbraith's book ""Money, whence it came and where it went"" much, much better - and much shorter. I also recommend ""the Great Wave"" by David Hackett Fischer, which, although not as rigorous, is a fascinating read."
1,"Knocking 'The Rock""",This film is about as weak as I remebered it to be when I first saw it 50 years ago. I only took it because it came as a package with Rock Around the Clock
3,the 50's,"This is an awful movie, but kind of fun in a nostalgic way. I was surprised that Bill Haley's band sounded so good. Black people not allowed as dancers, or to watch the show, or be in the movie as characters - only as performers - were we really that stupid and prejudiced back then?"
4,rock rock rock,Love these old movies. The quality is just fine. I just wish the case photos were more life - like. A still shot from the movie would have been a better choice.
5,rock around the clock and don't knock the rock,I have not seen rock around the clock for years the last time i saw it must have been late sixties any way i was playing some of my rock n roll records and rock around the clock came on and i thought i must get the movie i found it on AMAZON it was fantastic to go back to the (future) and relive the great music that rock n roll is and don't knock the rock both are great movies so put on your dancing shoes slick back the hair and go back to the future for a couple of hours and enjoy both these movies 10/10
2,Double Feature,"Two stars because it is historic having early rock and rollers on camera. Also is a double feature. It is a sad story line. The movies were made just to make a quick buck, which it did. Even though you get two movies, the price is still too high. This should sell for about 6 or 7 bucks max. Too much money for what you get. If the money doesn't matter, and your a fan of the comets, then go ahead and get."
1,Don't buy this product,This is a horrible product the tube will not screw off like it is suppose to and it cannot be cleaned. I had to soak it for 3 days before I could finally get the thing apart to clean it. I've tried keeping it loosely fitted and that doesn't even work it just will not come off. Do yourself a favor and buy one of the other brands.
2,Not what we were looking for,"If a short video clip had been available to view, we never would have bought this item. Despite the new looking cover with a picture of a little girl on it, the video looks to have been made in the early 80's and features only adults who are already expert gymnasts. The teaching is definitely geared toward adults/teenagers who have already mastered the fundamentals of gynmastics and are very flexible. The outfits worn by the two female gymnasts who demonstrate all the moves were also immodest enough that we decided we couldn't show the video to our kids. On the positive side, the teacher does a good job explaining the mechanics of the tumbling moves and pointing out possible mistakes that can be made. We decided to return the item."
5,classic Died Pretty,Im listing to this disc for the first time. A great band that got very little airplay. It took me several years to find this disc and it was worth it. It rocks a little harder than Doughboy Hollow which is another five star disc.
3,Autobiography written for children,"Yoshiko Uchida writes of her childhood, growing up in California as a Japanese American during World War II. She vividly describes her internment experience through the eyes of a young adult. This is an important book because it documents the Japanese American experience. It also reveals the strong Christian faith of this family. The story rings of truth and how an ""average"" person deals with adversity. This book only rates three stars because although the story is interesting, the plot was predictable. I was not left with a breathtaking feeling after reading this book. My favorite books leave me thinking about them for days or even weeks afterwards."
3,Good!,"Such a book is so important to future generations, that we always remember those who suffered in the holocaust: those killed and those left behind"
4,Worth reading,"It's never easy to read stories regarding the Holocaust, but you have to appreciate the details in those books that try to really pull you into that time. This one is a bit unique in that the perspective is not so much that of a survivor looking out from within, but looking on from without, as she was (thankfully) hidden in various homes from the terrible plight of her friends and family."
5,Excellent fix for my Snapper,"This blade made my 21 year old Snapper work like new. I thought the engine had a bent valve, but the new blade not only fixed this it now vacuums the grass clippings like it was new again. If your thinking of replacing your Snapper, try replacing the blade first, might make it work like the day you brought it home!!"
3,alright but could be better,"BoF 4 was a decent old fashioned RPG but it was lacking some of the charm Bof 3 had. The comboing and mid-battle party swaping was cool, but I missed the large 3D world map a fighting battles on the actual dungeon floors rather than changing the battle field. Also learnig from th masters was time consuming... I couldn't learn everything by the time i finished :( Still it's an excellent game."
4,S'up kick *ss game,"S'up, this game was one of the greatest games ever made. The only problems with this game is that during the whole period of the game I never once had to try to level up to beat the boss. Which means that there was no challenge, and the game was beat without the work of a challenge. And during the game at one point or another I had no idea were to go or what to do so I had to find a site on the internet. The site is gamefaqs.com, (greatest site in the world for walkthroughs and secrets). But either than that they had mini games like a fairy village and if you do well in the fairie village you get to rename any character and this game period kicks a**."
5,This is a very fun and cool game...,"I'd say that this is a very fun and interesting game. The sidequests are good, because it makes the game even longer. The only thing about this game that many people don't like, is the camera settings. People say that they can be very frustrating. The music for this game is great. The themes for the variety of towns is fantastic! The battle system is pretty good too. You can learn different abilities from enemies by gaurding. If the name of the attack appears in blue, then that means it can be learned, but it may take some time to learn it. All the characters in this game are all skilled fighters, so you might want to rotate which ones you'll use. Also, everyone will get the same amount of experince points (EXP) after a battle. Hope this review helped!To me, this is one of the best games I have ever played! I hope you buy it, becuase you'll love it!"
5,This one Rules,"This game is Awesome, I love the Breath of Fire series. I have been a fan since it was on the old Super Nintendo. The gameplay is fun and addicting get it you won't be dissapointed."
1,damaged product,"I cannot review this product positively, because mine was damaged upon arrival, so I was unable to even use it. The pan was dented in on one side and not acceptable. I had to immediately send it back for a refund. The package it was shipped in was sloppily put together; it was only cushioned by a little bit of crumpled paper, which is probably why it was in that condition by the time it got to me. I'll never order a product like that again, if they can't do better. I replaced it with Paula Deen's version, which arrived in perfect condition, because it was packaged in it's own separate outside box, and wrapped very well. Order it instead; the quality is better also."
2,Often Requires Fixing,"Battat makes some good, low-budget toys. There are two design problems with this tape measure, however:1) The ratchet makes it difficult to turn and what parent wants another toy that makes annoying noise. It is not as if real tape measures make clicking noises. You can, however, open this toy up with the five screws and completely remove the ratchet. That solves this problem entirely and makes the tape reel very easy to pull in.2) Unfortunately, as other parents have noted, the tape often gets lodged between the two plastic shells that form the housing. Sometimes I can get it unstuck quickly, often I have to open the tape measure up again.This would be a great, budget toy if it were designed properly. Unfortunately it is harder to use than a real tape measure. This one is fun until it fails, and then it lies around with its tape all unwound waiting for parental attention. Battat, please redesign!"
1,"nice idea, but not built for my boy","I had originally intended to get this to go with the workbench my, not quite three year old, got for Christmas, but it got forgotten. Then in March his birthday rolls around and I remember to get it. I wish I had forgotten it again. He opened it up, eyes bright, jumping in his excitement and starts to measure everything he can reach. Within TEN minutes it was broken: can't wind it up, can pull the tape out."
2,Flawed design,"We were thrilled to find this for our 4 yr old son, and wanted something durable since his 2 yr old sister has a habit of destroying everything. Unfortunately, although the casing and tape themselves are sturdy, this toy is poorly designed. There is a edge on the plastic piece (not broken, just the way it was designed) where the tape comes out, and unless the tape is pulled out completely straight, the tape ""catches"" on this extra piece, gets twisted, and then neither pulls or retracts. A patient adult can feed it in, untwist it, and make it work again, but this is happening over and over (no matter which kid is playing with it). Too bad, because if not for this design flaw, it would have been perfect for us."
2,too much treble in the vocals,There so much to like about this band and this CD but they decided to record ALL of the vocals through a filter that makes the singing artificially thin and high-ranged. Wayyyyy too much treble. It sounds over-processed and it is. I suspect it was done because the singer has limited range but I'd rather listen to his real voice than what they have done here to mask it. Blech.
2,"Great movie, but sound quality was horrific.",Good premise. Would have been a great movie if the sound wasn't inconsistent. And it was not my TV...Really needs to work on the digital experience.
2,THERE ARE BETTER MOVIES !,"While I didn't expect much from this familiar tale, it could have been much better! The characters are not well developed and we don't really care what happens to them. It's long for this type of film(over 2 hours) and when you don't care about the characters, it only makes it seem that much longer. I like ""The Rock"", but his decent films are few and far between. It's a watch-able movie, but I have seen many more entertaining and inspiring films of this nature!. If you must see this...Rent it! Don't buy it!"
3,"A Good, Wholesome Movie","This movie is perfect to watch on a Saturday night with the family when you simply feel like cuddling up, relaxing, and not having to think about anything."
3,Middle of the road,"Some nice football, but overall predictablle. The real footage at the end was a nice surprise."
5,The Gridiron Gang,I was able to get this one for us and I got it for my boyfriend I am glad it came right on time I was really glad that I was able to get something for him. this movie was good I haven't watched all of it but sometime when I am not so busy I will thanks again
4,Gridiron Gang Satisfies,"While the Gridiron Gang, like most sports movies, has game sequences that are unrealistic, the story is compelling enough to carry the movie. The acting is good and believable, and you end up caring for the characters. Inspirational and thought-provoking. Coarse language may make it inappropriate for younger viewers."
5,fabulous!,this movie has a great moral behind it and i loved watching it. it will be one i have my kids watch when they are alittle older!
5,Gridiron Gang has HEART,"This is a great movie!!! It had heart & spirit, told the story without going overboard. It's wonderful what Mr. Porter has done, and Dwayne Johnson (Rock) does a great job filling the role. Of course, loving football made this a must see for me, and watching the boys come together and learn to be a team as well as becoming friends with Dwayne in the lead (being macho without the usual hoopla)made for a riviting movie. It being a true story made it even better. It's a movie I know I'll watch over & over!!"
4,Great Moview/Better Price,"I purchased the movie for my son's birthday. He likes it and it may teach valuable lessons. Good price on the item, better that department stores (only shipping extra)."
4,positive gridiron influence,The story of sean porter and his dream is protrayed well in this movie starring the rock and xzibit. Normally I don't care for the rock as an actor but he did a surprisingly good job playing as the coach of the deliquent kids. The story is good but it isn't too different from any other sports/reform movie. So at times the story can be predictable. But the acting and the fact that it is a true story makes it a movie worth watching.
4,Very good movie,"Even if this kind of script has been seen before, the story is pretty interesting to follow, I have enjoy this movie and I am quite sure you will also. If you have enjoy movie like ""Remember the Titan"" or ""Invicible"", surely you'll like this one too."
1,Disapointed,This book really is a basic introduction to Lee Enfield rifles. After ordering books from Charles R Stratton and Ian Skennerton I found Alan Petrillo's book lacking in detail. I was able to learn more about the Lee Enfield rifle by surfing the web while I was waiting for this book to arrive. My suggestion is don't waste your money on this book.
4,Information on the Enfield Rifle,Very informative. I bought this book after I bought an Enfield rifle. It tells me where it was made and when. This is information that I wanted to know. Good book.
3,"Not enough info on rifle, too much on Sniper","Book was rated OK for the basic info it contained, but I was disappointed by the fact that the author used 17 of the 64 pages to describe the sniper rifle version, the use of the sniper sling and sniper rifle instructions. Most people can't afford a genuine Enfield Sniper rifle. The 17 pages plus the 4 on the bayonet could have been put to better use."
4,Very informative,If you have a Lee Enfield rifle and need some clarification about its history or are just interested in learning about one of the most famous commonwealth rifles in history I would definitely suggest this book. The one downside is it could go into more detail in some subjects like the various manufacturer markings where they were and the small details and there could have been some more lengthy explanation on some subjects but for what it is and what its worth is a good buy.
3,Introduction to the No 4 Lee-Enfields,"I recently purchased my first Lee-Enfield, a No 4, MK 2 made in 1955. This book is moderately helpful but does not have the detail I was looking for. It certainly is not expensive and is worth the $16.99 (including shipping) that I paid. I may buy the much more expensive book by Ian Skennerton to get a much more comprehensive look at the Enfields."
1,Surprize!,"I just recived my new pans. They are not ceramic interior. They are your basic non stick. Every web site will tell you ceramic, I called KitchenAid and was told that is a non stick interior. If you are looking for true ceramic interior pans do not buy these."
3,"Good, but could be improved.","I think the book is pretty good, but the price Amazon.com offers it at is higher than bookstore prices. Also, the page numbers and organization of the book is very confusing. I am taking a course at college that uses this book and the organization is very difficult to follow."
5,First Excel book that has taught me new things!,"This book does a great job of showing almost Excel guru functions. Skip the first couple of chapters about formating and how to move around in windows. After those, the book presents easy to follow lessons that will turn novices into experts. Only downside is that visual basic is not ceovered well-- although it does a reasonbable job introducing it-- it should have been left out of scope."
5,too expensive,Thought you might want to know that your price is higher then the bookstore price. Why?
3,here's the answer to all of the stupid questions...,"I wonder why all of you are in college, because you are all stupid. No online bookstore or chain retail bookstore can provide any, not any, book at a better price than the university bookstore. Do you understand, that's the point in a university bookstore, or a college bookstore. Don't buy your college books online, no one has them cheaper. Please, next time you leave a thoughtless review, please leave your full name so I know who never to hire for any job."
5,A GOOD PRODUCT FOR ITCH DRY SKIN!,I love this soap! My daughter has ezcema and I usually order this soap once a year to help with her dry skin and itchiness.
3,just what I wanted,I loved being able to order the book I needed quickly. It arrived in excellent condition within the week.
3,I use this because I'm lazy,The collars work great to keep the wax from entering the gap between the can and the warmer.You can make this yourself to save money. It's just a cardboard with a cut out of the can. I am still on the 1st collar after 3 uses. I don't see why I would need to change it until I change the can of wax.
5,A Must,These clean collars are a MUST if you are waxing at home.The wax gets so stringing and what doesn't get on the spatulagets on the collar & keeps things neat & clean.
5,does the job!,"i use this with my Gigi pot....makes for a clean wax pot everytime i need to change the collars..thick cardboard ensures the wax does not leak, and is very easy to change....does the job very well"
4,Love it!,"I am a soccer fanatic. I bought this book to become more confident in my game. It was a great book with lots of personal insight from players and suggestions for soccer skills. Great for any soccer players, specifically female."
5,A Coaching Must Have,"If you are considering coaching at any level, this is a must read. Anson translates his passion for soccer into an enjoyable and easy read. His honesty regarding technique, strategy and motivation will improve anyone's coaching ability. Highly recommended."
5,Excellent Little Crepe Pan,"I cook mostly in regular stainless steel pans, but when you're doing crepes, it is really nice to have a nice reliable friend like this KitchenAid non-stick to help you out! Just the perfect size and well constructed, I especially find the siliconized handle a tremendous boon to ban the burn. A bargain for the dough."
3,Good pan but needs oil,"I purchased this pan mainly to make scrambled eggs from egg beaters and read in the instructions not to use a cooking spray since it kills the non-stick surface. Perhaps so, but when I followed directions (including washing the pan first) and made the eggs, a lot of soaking and scraping was needed to get out the the egg residue that coated the entire pan. Since then I have used some spray and it works fine. A little light, but well balanced and typical of pans in this price range."
4,Just fell short for me,"I must say I was looking forward to the final book in the series. I didn't feel the same strong attachment with these characters that I felt with the first and second books. Nice ending, but just missed the mark for me."
1,"Poorly written, poor character development","3 youths are sent back from 2062 to 1962 to stop Kennedy's mistake in allowing nuclear war. Plot is thin. Individual characters are not developed.One main character (out of 3) dies, and this occupies 2 small paragraphs. Wordy, yet little substance. Complete waste of money."
1,Sophmoric,"I can only imagine Mona Clee as a 19 year old idealistic liberal (nothing wrong with that) with a masters in history. One of her characters lives into her 90's, but her depth of personality, sense of history as lived, and experience never passes that of your average college student.Clee's grasp of recorded history is sound, but historic figures are painted with a casual brush, and fictional characters are two dimensional. I never did figure out what Daria was doing there, except to serve as a place holder."
2,Liberal screed,"This book could have been a genuinely enjoyable escapist novel, but unfortunatlely, comrade Clee's obvious left-wing Democrat leanings color the whole thing. In her work, the biggest heroes in world history are JFK, RFK, and the poor misunderstood Russians. She even gives us an adoring encounter with a teenage Bill Clinton (God save us all!) In her world, war is ALWAYS wrong, and is nearly always caused be neanderthalistic conservatives. In fact, she hates the United States in its current form so much that her ultimate solution is to literally split it in two and give half to the Russians. All hale mother Russia, comrade Clee! Now why don't you move there?"
4,Worthwhile Exploration,"After listening to him in one of his book launch at Bangalore, I decided to buy his first book purely from the experimental perspective and analyze how someone grows as a author. I took some time to read this book but each visit was a journey on its own. The vivid imagination of characters and details was something new to me and I had good time reading it. The language of the book is another reason I enjoyed it thoroughly. I would highly recommend to people who would like to give book reading a try and particularly non-fiction. After reading this book my perspective has changed regarding non-fiction, which I initially thought as total waste of time. Looking forward to reading other titles now."
4,Memorable Book,"Memories of this book have been haunting me since I read it in the third grade. Without remembering details, a title, or an author, I have been searching for this book armed with only a recollection of a girl being held hostage and rescuing herself using a cellphone. I have finally found this creative book again."
1,"This book is awesome, by far the best book I ever read","This book is really boring, the only reason I read this book is because my teacher made us do a book report. The first three pages were somewhat interesting then the fourth page made me sleepy. The one part that was exciting was where the main character was kidnapped by two robbers. If you want to read the most retarded book of your life, BUY THIS BOOK!!!The main character gets kidnapped because she was a naughty girl and snooping around while two robbers were trying steal precious values from her family and her snooping around in the middle of the night. At the end she breaks free from the robbers and steals the cellphone in their kitchen and calls the police."
2,Not really a pickle picker,"Looks like my old and broken pickle picker but will not pick up the pickles. Unless it is used to ""stab"" the pickles it does not work."
4,Crash Bandicoot: N-Tranced,"The book should've been entitled ""Crash Bandicoot's N-Tranced to yhe Lin-Zy Bonsai"". Look! I haven't read this yet...so I decided to buy and read it instead (if I have enough money). The title I'd written has enough goodness than the usual. It has: New Crates, New Characters, New Levels, even a New Foe. The foe's name's Tania...if you ever heard it. She's a masteress of clones and'll take on anyone. Good Luck...and watch out for her...she'll get ya! The heroines/sisters that's challenged are Tifani and Vivani. They'll be your help to find the Tanians (lil' Tanias) to recreate the Earth. This is easy to read... I/ya hope."
3,Rich in theology ; a little bit poor in biblical content,"I have read positive reviews for this commentary, and Carson especially said that ""it is rich in its biblical-theological reflection."" I am agree that this commentary is rich in theology, but it is hard for me to find excellent biblical reflection in it. For me Barnett is just too fast to move into the theological content, before he digs deep enough into the original meaning of the text. I do wish that he would be more focus on 2 Corinthians itself."
3,Buy Martin instead,"Passable, but not meaty enough; the section on the integrity of 2 Cor. is especially weak. Buy Martin's (Word) commentary instead."
3,Portfolios That Sell,"The book was worth the $3.00 I picked it up for (used) but probably not too much more. The information is fairly generic and basically covers best practices for self promotion. No insider secrets, tips & tricks to set yourself apart from the competition, or surprising revelations. Most of what's covered is standard common sense."
2,Very Very Disappointed!!,"I ordered a (set of six) as it states for my family Christmas party on the 28th and recieved one! One fondue fork does not do me a whole lot of good unless you want to pass it around to use! I kept thinking I would receive the other 5, but didn't.Not use to this from Amazon!! My go-to place for everything! Only reason I gave it 2 stars is b/c I love Amazon!"
1,not clear how many came in the order,was surprised that the quanity was not 6. i should have checked the the amount more closely. will pay more attention next time.
3,disappointed,"I was very disappointed when I opened this book. I thought I was reading his other book, WINNING THE WAR WITHIN, with a new cover. Essentially I was. There is not enough new information in this book to justify buying both. It should have been published as a newer version of the old book, not a totally new book. Sorry, it is well written, an awful lot of good and well presented information, but feel like I was charged twice for the same book. If you don't own the War Within, then by all means, buy this book. If you do, then I'd pass. Thank you."
4,Excellent source of information about an important issue,"Inflammation Nation walks you through the details of most important development in preventive medicine of the last ten years. You might be surprised to find out that some of the foods we think of as super healthy (salmon, anyone?) may actually be elevating your risk of heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, and other ailments. Particularly recommended to anyone who follows Atkins, Sugarbusters, or the Zone Diet, where the dangers of diet-driven inflammation are not adequately addressed."
2,extreme deficiency,"What the authors say about inflammation and arachidonic acid is true and significant, but the lask of mention of other causes of inflammation is hard to forgive. Not a word is said about toxins, homocysteine, infections, oxidants, or inflammatory vegetable oils. among many causes of inflammation. YOu might try THE INFLAMMATION SYNDROME, or HONEST NUTRITION."
1,NOT worth the $$$...Dr. Chilton needs to go back to the lab and study harmful effects of aspartame...,Book was cogent until I got to the approval of aspartame and diet sodas. Chilton needs to go back to the lab.
3,There are better books,"I was reading this book until I came to a page where he says: diet sodas are ok on this diet. What? Are you kidding me? It's a terrible product......aspartame for starters and the acid that rips your stomach apart. What was he thinking? Of course, the other information in the book is good, but I can't believe he would suggest artificially flavored sodas. That blew his veracity for me. Perhaps I shouldn't throw the baby out with the bath water, but......."
2,A little too cute,"I appreciated this book for its overview of the epidemic of inflammation, but I found the material a bit thin. The very cute and somewhat dramatic presentation style took the substantive material that is there and diluted it. The recommendations and the sample meals left me feeling that Mr. C doesn't know as much about nutrition as we need to approach this through diet. A number of the foods in those meals shouldn't be included in any healthy diet, let alone one designed to reduce inflammation: Canadian Bacon? Margarine (even ""non-trans fat""?) Low fat Cream cheese? Heated oils for stir fry? Grilled foods? Fried oysters (a seafood likely to be high in heavy metals?) No thanks."
4,interesting,"I have now read Inflammation Nation, Win the War Within, and The Gene Smart Diet which are all about the fact that Inflammation is the cause of so many of our chronic ailments today, and that by eating right and getting the proper exercise we can reduce the inflammation in our bodies and live healthier, happier lives. I bought these books and read them in the hope that I can help myself. I have just started the diet so it will be a little while before I know if it is working, but I seem to be feeling some better. I recommend this book highly!"
5,A heavyweight weighs in to the Y2K discussion,"A am glad to see an author of Howard Ruff's reputation weighing in to the fight for truth. He was there in the 1970s and again two decades later to shine a little reality on a foggy situation. Clear, understandable advice on what is likely to happen with the banking systems and social security and how to assess the impact on one's life, health and finances.I also recommend The Survivor's Guide to The Year 2000 by David Epp as it had compelling reasons to invest in the metals because of Y2K - and most interesting - even if it were not for Y2K. With the FED printing money at over 10 percent, inflation is sure to raise its ugly head very soon. The question is what next and when? These two books clarified that for me perfectly. I am ready and will be prepared thanks to two very well researched books."
3,Little help?,This might sell more copies if the movies in the pack were listed somewhere.... If anyone who has this can list them I would be much obliged. :-)
2,Not terribly useful collection,"While the movies here in and of themselves are not 'bad' movies, unless you really want to buy them all you would probably be better off seeking the specific movies that you want rather than coughing up $115 for them here."
3,It is a bad deal.,With the market for the DVD's being so competetive you can buy these DVDs individually at a much cheaper price than as an action pack on amazon. Don't be fooled go else where. The movies are good so I'd get them just not all at once like this.David
1,FINALLY!,"Finally, Amazon.com has done it! Collected 12 DVDs that you wouldn't pay [a price] each for... and put them all in one mega set that you can have for [a price]!Fine films, all."
1,Hartz - Scrunch N' Punch Cat Toy,Cheap. Terrible. I was embarrassed to even admit to my CAT that I purchased this thing. Buy this product if you need some extra things in you trash can!
1,Useless,Doesn't hold together properly as base is too weak so wires lean over to the floor.Neither of my cats is interested in it.Please don't waste your money on this piece of junk!
1,DANGEROUS! BEWARE!,"I DO NOT recommend purchasing this toy for your cat. The wires holding the toys have sharp metal ends that are curved at the top. While one of my kitties was playing, one of these sharp ends got caught just below her eye! Thankfully it missed her eye or she would've lost her eyesight. I had to take WIRE CUTTERS to get the thing out of her skin! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS TOY!"
3,lost tracks?!?! i dont think so,"this cd is very dissapionting, it says ""lost tracks"" but it sounds like they were lost a couple of months agono old school here, just stuff with lame hookstheres a few good songs, but i hate putting on a cd which only has 3 good songs on it"
2,pitching it after one year's use,"I don't know why, but part of the surface was ruined and now is no longer non-stick. It looks like the surface was burned. (It has always been hand washed and never used with metal utensils.)Also, it is quite heavy and a little hard to handle when transferring from the stove and/or while washing."
3,Where's the cover?,"I needed a pan with a ""helper handle"" and this is fine for a few things, however, it really should have a cover. Its impossible to cook so many items that need to be simmered because the sauce can go everywhere and you can't melt cheese on a dinner while its in the pan. I find this pan pretty useless and usually go back to my old set of pans. Kitchenaid should offer a cover."
1,terrible freestyle,"This compiliation only has one good song ""heartbreaker"" The songs are not freestyle and are boring. This cd deserves 0 stars , but I will be generous and give it a 1/2 a star. One of the worst compiliations in freetyle ever."
2,very helpful,"I give it 2 and not 1 star is because of some good information. She tells us to fall in love with Universe. Because of this and other similar comments I give it 2. I do recommend that you listen to this. She has a lot of good, and helpful information that will help you see things from a different side of problems & relationships. don't accept everything she tells you, but some of the information will open your eyes on dealing with problems and relationships. And even if you're not in one at the moment, you still need to hear this. This is a must for all who is in a relationship or thinking to enter one.Easy to listen, she's a great speaker"
2,Mattress pad,Was a bit disappointed in this pad. It's not made the same way the smaller incontinence pads are made. The facing on this one tends to pill and it's got plastic in it so it's hot to sleep on.Intend on taking two of the smaller pads and sewing them together to fit our queen sized bed to use when and if needed.
5,MMM good!,"Hmmmm......how do you rate a food product? you either like it or you don't, & this one I liked! I think its a little expensive for what you get but hey.....good things cost, right?Pros:1. ease of use. Quick & easy2. taste(especially with a smoked ham hock tossed in)cons:1. costwould I buy this product again? Definiteley! Hey, I'm a guy & this is guy food.......quick & easy, no culinary skills required, & tastes great. The main prerequisites for guy food :o). Try it you'll like it!"
1,Not so hot,This film sucks. The worse job of film editing I have seen. Must have been made for someother continent.
2,DragonSpell... not a fan.,"This book is part 1 of a fantasy series by Donita K. Paul. I was drawn to this book because of its interesting name and cover, but I was disappointed by it's contents. I found this novel to be fast-paced and the dialogue very unintelligent. I hate posting a review like this, but I was just very unimpressed by the story itself. I did like the central themes of it, however.The characters, I found, had little growth and development. Kale, the main character, goes through a journey of self-discovery... without much self-discovery. Also, nothing bad *really* happens to her, until after each mission. Saving Celisse, rescuing Leetu; the bad things happened after they were saved. I found this unrealistic. Shouldn't something have gone wrong in each rescue mission? Well, that's all I really have to say about this one. Perhaps I should just stick with what I know. Journeying outside my fiction comfort-zone never works out well for me."
1,BEWARE!!! THIS BOOK IS LAME!!!!!!!!,"I could not finish this book. Which is saying alot, since I'm currently plugging through The Last of The Mohicans, convinced to finish it, and am known to read 400+ page books in one day. And yet I could not finish this. Why? It's poorly written and is utterly plotless, would work better as a short story. But nope. It's... well... let's just say it's beyond overrated. And from a person nearly obsessed with dragons, well... the best part of the book for me was the birth of that one little dragon; it nearly made me cry. But the rest was lame. So lame. Go reread the Dragonlance trilogy, the Space Trilogy, Raising Dragons, Tolkien, or a Star Wars novel if you're tempted to read this.Don't give in to the temptation.And yet, if you insist on reading it, I'll give you my copy!!"
5,good novle for young people,This whole series is a great one I have always love medieval fantasy stuff and this is one of the best books I have ever read with no stupid immoral things its not to hard to follow what the author is telling you and its a great adventure with dragons of all sorts good knights bad knights evil wizards and bad . Its all together a great novel.
2,Christian Fiction,"This is Christian fiction. Which I woldn't have minded except it wasn't mentioned before I bought the book. There are different names for God and Satan but it is pretty obvious. Not only that but I personally felt that the author was preaching at me the whole time. To be honest I didn't read the whole thing. I stopped at 38%. The reason *SPOILER* was because 2 of the main characters had just risked their lives saving a dragon that had been captured and tortured daily. They were going to use this dragon to help save another member of their party which had been kidnapped. Upon being set free the dragon killed the people who had killed her friends and tortured her. After this one of the main characters says he can't travel with the dragon, and that they will just have to walk to save their friend, because God does not of approve. *END SPOILER* Like I said to start with if your into christian fiction and you like fantasy than this book is for you."
3,Great for introducing fantasy.,"I initially bought this book and the rest in the series for myself, but ended up giving them to my younger sister. As someone who loves Lord of the Rings, the Inheritance cycle, the Books of Pellinor, the Chronicles of Narnia and so forth, I found this series a little tedious and boring. My sister who hasn't really read fantasy LOVED them. I'd recommend this series to kids who were curious about the fantasy genre and hadn't really read anything to compare this to. Because...when you start comparing this series to Lord of the Rings and such...well, there's no comparison."
2,DRAGON SPELL,I'M SORRY BUT THE PERSON READING THE BOOK COULD NOT HOLD MY ATTENTION. I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS HUMDRUM.I WOULD PROBLEY BUY MORE OF THE BOOKS IF IT WAS READ BY SOMEONE WHO GAVE IT LIFE.C.L.GARSEE
5,fun fantasy adventure story,"I loved this book! It is a fun fantasy adventure with just the right combination of both elements.It has a great storyline and loveable characters.This book is full of insight and can really tug at your heart.I love the picture you draw from the description of the characters.I felt I could see each of them and felt as though they were my friends too.I never knew what was coming next, especially as the friends came across some not so friendly creatures in their quest.This is a very fun story to read.I highly recommend it to everyone."
5,This book totally ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!,"I really love this book!!!I love the part when Dar and Leetu Bends come to Kale's rescue and save her from those mean grawligs.Iam very interested in the setting!I've always been interested in Medeival things.I love the ending,Kale found Gem and Metta her minor dragons and she defeted Rito.When I read the end I was so ecxited to read the next book."
1,Did not enjoy this book,This book was not very enjoyable and I would not recommend it to someone else. I was never able to really get in to it.
5,Absolutely Fabulous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My daughter just loved the first book so she came back to the BX and got DragonQuest, DragonKnight, and DragonFire. She couldn't wait for DragonLight to come out."
3,Fantasy readers beware!!!!!!,"So I got this book for my kindle after reading just the summary of the book and the preview I had sent to my device. I loved the first few chapters of this book. The plot is creative and I like the main character, but if you are not looking for a Christian fantasy novel Do Not Read This Book.The reviews say you can read this novel just as a Fantasy novel, I don't feel this is true. When one of the main characters goes on a half page long monologue about how you must out your trust in 'god' and believe that he will lead you on the correct path, this stops being a fantasy novel and falls firmly into Christian fiction.This is not a bad thing, the book is well written and I thought the story line was going well. But even after the characters monologue the overtones of Christianity were too much for me.This is not necessarily a bad book, just not for me."
4,Caught my attention,"I first picked up this book while spending the afternoon at a local book store. I began reading and found myself peaked enough to go home and purchase it from Amazon for my Kindle. It has a great underlying message, intermixed with the well developed characters (who continue to grow), interesting scenes, and enough action to move the story forward.Donita Paul seemed to have ended this story rather abruptly (as well as the following books, though I would rate all just as highly)"
1,Wary,"I started reading DragonSpell; however, after the first couple of chapters, I was uncomfortable with the presence of somewhat excessive magic. I was unable to finish reading DragonSpell.While I am certain that this series contains nothing akin to witchcraft, I am still wary of the series."
3,dragonspell,this was an enjoyable read and at a very good price. unfortunately the next books in the series are much more expensive and are just not worth that much money. hopefully the prices will lower soon.
1,a sham,"I had great hopes for this book, I was looking for great places to bring a dog. The descriptions invariably started out with some cute language then went on as if you didn't have a dog. I had the destinct impression that another book on parks was repurposed by just a few silly 'bring your tail-waggin' pooch ...' phrases tacked on to the front of each paragraph. The description for one park recommended bringing your kite. Can you imagine flying a kite with your dog on a leash?Disappointing."
5,calender,I thought it was great till I realized it was last years calender. Otherwise I've always liked this style calender. Please have next years available also.
3,Good product.,Too expensive for product available at brick and mortar stores for much less. Make a quick run and buy a bunch there.
4,arthur's april fool,my son loved this book. he was having a problem with a bully at school and this book really help him see that even big bully's have weaknesses.
3,arthur's april fool,it was an okay book. I think that D.W. and Arthur make the perfect brother and sister because they always disagree. It was a funny book because Arthur does a good trick on Binky.
2,Sloppy Work,"This book has a major continuity problem - Arthur and Buster are shopping on March 31st, they have problems with Binky the next day at school, and then the following day is April Fool's Day (April 1). Somehow, the author managed to wedge an extra day in there.Other problems include a teacher watching Binky bully Arthur without intervening, and then everyone laughs when Binky falls off the stage at one point, which is not cool even for a bully.Otherwise, it's a pretty cool book."
2,Great for tomatos,"I bought this with high hopes, alas the reviews I had read were correct, and no amount of sharpening could overcome the inherent softness of the metal. Titanium is a great lightweight, abrasion resistant material that won't rust, but in it's alpha form is just not very hard, and hardness is what is needed for a sharp cutting edge. The newer beta phase titanium knives are supposed to be a vast improvement, don't settle for anything less in a knife."
1,Had High Hopes,"I love the color and absolutely love my mixer of the same color so I bought the cookware to match. Well, it did not hold up like I would expect. After over a year of use the non-stick coating is flaking off. I already had to throw out the smaller skillet that matched this one because of the same problem. Very disappointing. I had very high hopes for this skillet. If not for the flaking I would have loved it (even with the discoloration as another reviewer mentioned).**Update**I finally had to throw it away a few months ago. The worst skillet I've ever bought. The ONLY good things about it were the handles."
5,Prog masterpiece!!,"Derek Sherinian along with Simon ""Party In My Pants"" Phillips is absolutey a deadly combination. This CD smokes from start to finish with a killer version of the Edgar Winter classic ""Frankenstein"". Don't miss this one. Highly recommended. Prog at it's best."
3,"Okay, but...",I wish he would stop doing those tracks with the 2 minutes of silence at the end and then 3 seconds of goofy noise.
4,Eau de Toilette,very specific a scent. But how do you describe the smell of a rose? Try it you'll like it.
5,Hop on the Train!,"I've read a lot of books on investing and seen a lot of so-called experts on CNN and CNBC and quite frankly none of them are as plain-spoken and insighful as Joseph Curatolo. The book really does get us all back to the basics of investing and it reminds us how to amass your wealth ... slow and steady. I've also never seen any book on investing that told you how to work with your broker to maximize your profits. Suze Orman's books are pure pablum compared to the solid information The Investment Train gives you. I hope I start seeing the author on some network financial shows, he's got a lot of important things to say."
5,An essential book for project managers,"Easy and comprehensible step by step guide to project management, very helpful for both experienced and entry level project management engineers"
2,It's like reading an outline,The book is surprisingly high-level regarding how one should go about construction management. It's also quite a dull read. I was expecting the book to be structured around one construction case or a number of cases to illustrate how to apply the procedures suggested in the book. It's kind of like reading an outline with very few examples to draw from.
1,Practical techniques,"This book has the basic knowlegde tha every CM must know, its easy to read, and it give you a better and required professional overview of construccion projects."
2,Doesn't motivate a busy mother to exercise.,"I bought this video expecting it to be fun and motivating like other Buns Of Steel videos. I found, however that it was extremely low key and quite boring. Unfortunately, I don't use it and I'm looking around for something more motivating."
5,OATMEAL SOAP,"A GREAT BAR OF OATMEAL SOAP WITH LOTS OF OATMEAL TO GIVE THAT SCRUBBING EFFECT. ALSO, IT LATHERS VERY WELL AND LEAVES A CLEAN SCENT."
1,Maybe it's just me,"but I've never found an Irish Breakfast tea that I like. This one, like the others I've tried, tastes like boiled sticks and dirt to me. I drink it only when I'm too tired to appreciate a more flavorful cup. But perhaps if you're a fan of the style, you'll find it exquisite..."
1,"Not A Book, A Monograph","This is a history of a ""still-born"" railroad project in Missouri. The project was never built and the author explores the reasons why the original concept was never developed. The line was originally intended to extend north of the Missouri River, but there is little information about this in the document. Also, the document lacks maps which could have been used to illustrate the builder's concepts, and the existence of rival or competing rail lines. Also largely unmentioned is the political atmosphere in Missouri at the time of the 1870's and 1880's, including passage of a statewide Constitution the forbade governmental entities from getting directly involved in the financing of railroads.This document is also a monograph, similar to the type of document a college student would turn in as a research paper for an upper level history class. The document is not a book. Listing it as a book seems misleading to this reviewer."
2,"Some good, some bad","First the good - nice and heavy, heats evenly, good quality ""feel"". Now the bad. I've had two of them and both behaved the same way. Despite using only plastic utensils, multiple small scratches developed. And despite following instructions and never using a heat setting higher than ""medium"", both began to stick within about six months of usage. Even bacon! Fool me once - shame on me. Fool me twice - shame on me again I guess."
5,Non Stick Shabbos Kugel Pan,"This pan is Great for Shabbos Lokshin Kugel .It has a great non stick surface and a wonderful heavy aluminum clad bottom to heat evenlyI give it 5 starsP.S. it does fry chicken shnitzel greatly, as a home chef I recommend it"
5,Perfect collection from one of the best actors ever,This is a perfect collection of Al Picino movies. Every one would recieve a 5 star rating from me. He is one of the greastest actors there ever was and on DVD the movies are better than ever. A must have for any fan of Al Picino.5 Stars
1,WRONG PART,Not the part in the add. They say it is a bad data entry in thier data base. They made it good though... no problem.
1,What happened to Charlie?,"I have read all the ""Charlie Bradshaw"" mysteries. I feel that the later books are entirely too frivolous with Victor as the main character and narrator. They have a very different feel and it's not one that I like. When Charlie was the star of his own books and Victor his side-kick, the amount of humor was just right. Now the books are just too goofy!"
2,just too slow,"After reading Fortress in the Eye of Time I was eager to savour this celtic effort by the same author.I found the same neat, accurate writing, the same fastidious attention to detail, the same unconventional characters.Mr/Ms Cherryh (I still have not found out which) shapes a fascinating twilight world were dimming elves, more inhuman than I have ever found them in a fantasy, are fading leaving their place to humans. There is no sense a fulfillment, nor predestination. Just sadness.It is not easy to create a novel out of these ideas. The author managed it in Fortress in the Eye of time, but this time unfortunately there is no plot. Nothing really happens in this book. Absolutely nothing. Characters do not come to life. You never connect with them. The atmosphere is fascinating but the final effect is boring.A disappointment."
4,Interesting but odd,I really like Cherryh's stuff but this was a little convoluted. A good read but hard to keep track of characters.
5,Such a great book!,"If you just, like me, went to Israel in vacation, or you are planning to go, or you just want to understand better ""the conflict"". This book is an open-eye, it gives you a new picture from the images we get from the television. A sincere and honest picture of the everyday reality of the people of Palestine.Very well written and easy to read."
5,Letters from the Woods,"Letters from the Woods brings one back to the quiet side of canoeing. With today's emphasis on extreme sports and wilderness experiences, this book is instead a pleasant journey through life, family and personal growth as seen from the seat of a canoe. The author takes us on a variety of wilderness canoe trips while sharing thoughts and discoveries about life and what it means to be a part of this earth. The book is thought provoking and enjoyable to read. Although I had previously read much of the material through a monthly publication, I found it difficult to put the book down once I started reading it. I leave the book close at hand and continually go back to different passages and it never ceases to bring quiet joy. I would readily offer this book to anyone to read, whether a paddler, or not. I certainly will be giving copies as gifts to the people I cherish."
5,Current issues and enduring questions,The book is just what I needed for class. Also I find it to be very helpful in writing papers
1,Why would you do this to yourself?,"My mother-in-law sent us this. Was she trying to make some kind of point? At any rate, it's not funny and even just reading the stereotypical, unfunny, cliched titles is enough to make you cringe yourself back into the last millennium. Who is this album even for? It's a tacky gift to give to a Jewish friend, and an even tackier and more awkward one to give to a Christian friend. Don't subject yourself to this atrocity against music, and even moreso, don't do subject a friend to it. Just say no to novelty dreck!"
3,Boring layout - but fun to read,"It's a nice idea and an intressting book. But I would like to have a thicker book covering more stars. This book just skimms the surface. Also there was no index, so it's hard so find the right info quickly. The layout is cheap. I want more work put into this book."
3,all right but there is better material out there for young adults,"I thought this was pretty good but found it oversimplified and eulogistic, even for young readers. I much preferThe Heart Has Reasons: Holocaust Rescuers and Their Stories of Couragewhich is also a somewhat easy read, at least the part of it that includes the narratives of the rescuers, but brings out the complexities and ambiguity that the moral decisions of the rescuers entailed. Likewise,In My Hands: Memories of a Holocaust Rescuerbut in that one the rescuer winds up trading sex with a Nazi for the safety of the Jews she was hiding, so some teachers might consider it unsuitable for young adults.Also, of course,Anne Frank Remembered: The Story of the Woman Who Helped to Hide the Frank Familywhich YA's will naturally find interesting, having probably readThe Diary of a Young Girl."
5,The way TvZ was meant to be experienced,"Though not quite as good as ""In the Rearview Mirror,"" ""Live and Obscure"" does considerable justice to the genius that was TvZ. His songwriting is absolutely amazing. The pure simplicity of his playing and singing leaves you speechless, just as in ""Rearview."" The sax adds character to the album, especially on ""Poncho and Lefty"", for a unique sound that is not overwhelming. All in all, you are left with TvZ doing what he does best, singing with a craftsmanship all his own and not duplicated anywhere else."
3,mournful intimacy,"When I first heard this I thought WOW! this is brilliant. These songs are so great and the tone of the album so satisfying that I thought these must be the definitive versions. His mournful voice and near perfect minor chord melodies and lyrics really hit hard. It's easy to get caught up in the romance of this guy's life and hearing the songs sung live with such intimacy is great. As I listen to more of his stuff, though, I hear better versions of many of the tunes here on other disks. Not bad but not essential."
5,Lo mejor de lo mejor de New Trolls,"Si alguien quiere conocer un grupo de Rock Italiano (e internacional podría añadir) como New Trolls debe comenzar por este disco.Unido con Concerto Grosso Nro. 01, New Trolls'79 es un trabajo que denota excelencia a la altura de cualquier otro grupo, de cualquier otro país, para la epoca.Sin duda recomendado en un 100%...Lo único que pudiera decir en contra es que la compra que realice por Amazon, resultó en que me enviaran la edición japonesa del disco. Es original, se escucha igualmente bien... pero bueno... no era lo que esperaba."
1,Falling Apart at the Seams,"After spending almost $150 on a bag, I hoped it would last for more then 18 months. I had already returned the shoulder strap, when the top seam began to tear along the handle. I am returning the bag, I assume for a replacement. I just hope it is a better experience."
1,try again,"A good idea for a story but terrible writing... excrutiatingly bad writing.... the story drags for over 100 pages and then when Belle and Boone end up in hell the story gets so ridiculous, that it is impossible to follow. The forced sexual tension could not save this badly written waste of money. Ms. Altom should really take some courses in plot development because this is a real stinker. If this is what publishers accept for publication just because romance sells, they've sorely misread their audience."
2,Sleeping Horror,"I liked the first two fifths of the story very well, but after that I'd say the story went to hell in a hand basket literally as well as figuratively. It went from being this charming, fun romantic comedy to a horror story. If you took the book and chopped off the last three fifths and burned it, then you could enjoy the first part and then make up the rest of the story yourself.Perhaps, if you like horror in your romance this sudden slide into horror would appeal, but in that case you might be impatient with the first part of the book."
1,Wasted potential,"The premise has fantastic comedic potential. A goody-goody Tooth Fairy and a Bogey Man who's convinced he's dying as he begins to transform into all his darkest desires? An Easter Bunny uncle? Fairies living in such mundane places as farms and ranches in Texas and Oklahoma and losing money in the stock market? Such are the things that cracktastic gold is made from. I expected a truly zany romantic comedy based on the cover. Sadly, the romance read like nothing so much as Stockholm Syndrome (perhaps appropriate for a female lead named Belle; Beauty and the Beast is my favorite fairy tale but it has its issues) while our intrepid heroine plays happy homemaker in her abductor's shack. Not worth it."
2,Missing Something,"It starts out as a fun, light fantasy-romance with a lot of promise. However, it turns into a confusing, twisted story of Good vs. Evil winding up in Hell. Way too many explanations are left out...how did he finally lose the wings??? Was an entire chapter accidently cut? Is the reader supposed to fill in the blanks? The ending just doesn't live up to the fun of the beginning. I think the author just has to pick a genre and stick with it."
4,Great Story,I especially liked the parts where all the Tallcheif men had to fight for their lady loves and how all these ladies considered their male counterpart to be delicate.This is a real good story which every reader can have fun with.Pick one up and I guarantee you will enjoy it.
4,Entertaining,Birk and Lacey have been building up for this book in the other titles in this family series by Cait London. Two explosive characters finally have to mesh and get over some misunderstandings. It was interesting to see Birk grow as a character when he must overcome his playboy image around town to finally make Lacey really see him.The Tallchief series is certainly some of the best by Cait London and it will be hard to pick a favorite.
3,Not the usual Clarks feel..................,"I've bought and worn probably at least 8 different pairs of Clarks comfort shoes, and normally LOVE each and every one. However, this sandal, which I consider the best-LOOKING of the Clarks I've worn, just doesn't have that cozy, comfortable fit and feel for which Clarks is so famous. Don't get me wrong: they aren't truly UNcomfortable---just not nearly as comfortable and ""cushy"" as I've come to expect from Clarks! While I'd have to rate the looks very high, the different and less cushioned-feeling insole and more generous sizing would have to bring the rating to a (reluctant) 3 stars. Springers have it all over this Clarks, comfort-wise."
4,"12 OF MORTON'S BEST SOLOS, ALBEIT SHORT ON TIME","Morton recorded these piano solos in December 1939, and ten sides were issued, on the General, Commodore and Vogue label. This compilation presents those ten sides, plus Sporting House Rag (which unaccountably was rejected originally) and an earlier alternate take of The Naked Dance which varies considerably from the issued version. Morton sings on five of the later sides, and his voice is as instantly recognisable as his piano style. This is of course the CD equivalent of the Commodore LP, and at just over half-an-hour playing time, falls well short of what a CD should offer. Nevertheless, these are some of Morton's best recorded solos, and his playing fully justifies 4 stars."
4,Spare Bucket for Lello 4090 Ice Cream Maker,"I really like that this bucket is really machined so exactly to match the sleeve it fits into. I wish there was a way, after the ice cream is made, to take the bucket out but it's always frozen to the sleeve with condensation. I'm not sure there's a fix for that, however, since it's the laws of physics that accounts for the freezing."
4,interesting read,"I have not finished reading it yet,but it does hold my interest and believe this is at least as possible as any of the world religion's."
5,Life changing book!,"This has to be the most amazing book I've ever read in the history of books. If you haven't read this yet then I suggest you get this book!This book will change your life in multiple ways, you will never look at life the same after reading this book. Now, for me, I can rarely read a book unless it's amazingly good. This book keeps me reading for hours, wanting to know more and more. I plan on purchasingThe Secret of the Soul: Using Out-of-Body Experiences to Understand Our True Naturewhich is by the same author as this book. I'm also looking into purchasingAnastasia (The Ringing Cedars, Book 1)which is another life changing book.Anyway, more about this book. The wording is great, you can understand everything. He goes into great detail about stuff, you may get bored of one chapter though. I believe it had to do with black holes and all, I'm not 100% sure. I kept reading it though because I did not want to put the book down.Read this book, you won't regret it."
4,Interesting & Enlightening,"This book really made me think differently after reading it. It makes sense and I'm glad I read it, you should too.I've had out of body experiences but I never knew that after some practice that you can penetrate various levels of our existence. Very interesting. There is much more out there than we realize. Why just go to sleep and wake up 8 hrs later without much else when you can turn your sleep time into an enlightening adventure without boundaries."
5,As good as everyone says it is,"If you're interested in learning how to OBE and get more connected with your spiritual self then this is a great pick. You get that and more. I personally have difficulties having OBEs because of my loud and busy environment. But I had my first OBE a few weeks after reading this book. The author did a good job writing on matters that are difficult to explain making it easy to absorb. Giving the reader a good understanding on OBEs. If you have never heard of OBEs or astral projection than reading this would be life changing. Yes I went there. Even though the book is almost 20 years old it is probably the best out there. He describes some good ways to do OBEs, I personally couldn't with any of his I used a tactile method. Just never give up and keep trying."
3,Algo nuevo y algo viejo...,"El autor aporta como novedad un intento de explicar 'la física' de estos fenómenos o si se quiere expresar de otra forma; intenta demostrar que son posibles, de acuerdo a lo que la ciencia sabe sobre espacio-tiempo, microcosmos, etc etc. Los métodos expuestos son con seguridad conocidos a quienes ya poseen varios libros en la materia."
1,Not working.,"Bought this book because its fame,regret it every minute. It is the same book like the ""Astral Dynamic"" total waste of time and money. Don't buy it."
3,It's a good read,"I thought it was a pretty good book,but sometimes it got repetitive,and didn't really give you steps to experiencing an OBE.It was more like a journal of HIS experiences.If you wanna read his journal,buy this book."
5,Ultimate Do It Yourself Guide,"Because this book is so well written and effective, I use it in classes I teach on the subject. It is one of the best I've read thus far, and stands out as a gem in personal development and inner exploration. William Buhlman puts the power into the hands of the reader, and lets you discover for yourself what is beyond your physical limits. The induction techniques are highly effective, and the personal accounts of his own OBEs set the stage and mood - they simply inspire you to find out for yourself! Furthermore, his personal experience will shed light on many experiences that the reader has perhaps brushed off in the past, dismissed, or never understood. Finally here is a well written account and manual to out of body exploration; one that helps create a container for experiences beyond the physical, and sheds powerful light into our own natural abilities."
5,Awesome Book!,"This is a really great book I read on OBE. Teaching about hot-to expereince our-of-body, what to experience, what are ups and downs, and theories.Although the author teaches out losing beliefs that is known of modern day mysticism of such spiritual beliefs and stories of OBE of other cultures, but the author self is not free of beliefs. Fact, much can be learned from other cultures without giving into beliefs, but meditating for truth. There is still little know of the nature of OBE, but the wisdom is there as long one loses the ego and use of logic, just simple meditate for understanding and wisdom."
5,Out-of-body experiences are exciting and you can do it!,Out-of-body experiences are by their very nature the cutting edge of human exploration. They provide a powerful verification of our spiritual identity and a proven method to explore ourselves and the universe.
5,Make you think about far away.,"Of all the OOBE books, this has got to be up with the best. Mr. Monroe's book plus this one will make all libraries first class in OOBE. You will learn something about which way the universe opens up. It is inward, a long long way inward. I will make you question and expect a lot of poopooing from others. He has a nice web page too. I recommend this book."
5,A fantastic book,"This is the best 'Out Of Body' book that I have read. A wealth of information, and very hard to put down. I found the author's theories on how the universe is constructed and how it functions, fascinating and definitely food for thought. I liked the way he approaches the subject with a scientific mind, even setting up his 'Out Of Body' experiences like a scientific experiment, in his quest to understand the process and verify the reality of their content."
1,Not worth the money!,I was already disappointed with the manual that comes with the game: They tell you that the technical reference is too extensive and plug you to buy the Prima Strategy book which I unfortunately did. It is partly a strategy guide and partly a technical supplement. More strategy guide than otherwise. I was hoping there would be a good description with tips on how to use the various functions in the game. What was most disappointing was that the icons in the building screen (one of the most important features in the game) are not described either in the manual or the strategy book. The book does give a description of each technical advancement and there is a chart at the end of the book. If you do think about getting this book look at it first. One thing to mention: The documentation might be lacking but the game is FANTASTIC!
4,It's a Warzone out there!,"Although I have played this game for a while it remains challenging and fun. This is not say it is without frustration, but generally for all you diehard fans of the genre it will make you crave a sequel or maybe even a prequel! I found the controls a little bit cumbersome making gameplay at times clumsy. The variety of units and situations compensates for this shortfalling. If I were to make anychanges at all, I would make more powerful longrange artillery pieces as well as more airsupport options. Another hinderance is the organization of battle groups. More battle groups should be an option as well as the way these groups follow their orders.All and all, despite these small annoyances, the action is enough to keep many an armchair general busy for a while."
4,Patient Workbook,"I loved Dr. Perkinson's book, ""Chemical Dependency Counseling"" and was eager to purchase this workbook for use with my clients in treatment. I found it helpful, but too expensive to require them to purchase it, or for our treatment center to purchase it for the 500 clients a year that we admit. I wish a CD-ROM was included, but I understand proprietary issues. I must say, however that I believe his publications should be mandatory for everyone working in our field."
1,Not scented,"Just received these markers and my son and I smelled each one of them. Only 3 smelled at all (brown, black, and the darker red. Only the black (licorice) smelled enough that you could smell without touching to your nose and sniffing so hard it hurt. So, they are markers, not scented. It is probably not possible to make a good set of scented washable markers. I needed markers anyway and wasn't willing to get non-washables yet, so I gave these a try. I'm not really too disappointed since I kinda thought the smell wouldn't be too great. They were worse than I expected though and I though I would write a review so the rest of you would know they are essentially regular, non-scented markers."
2,Fainted scent,"The markers work fine for markers, but I was specifically looking for scented markers. My son was thrilled to get these, but very disappointed that they barely smelled when you put it to your nose, and not at all when on paper. He was very disappointed because the scented markers at our children's church are very smelly! Thought these were the same ones, but it is obviously a different brand."
3,A combination of brilliance and boredom,"There is no middle ground in this series. Some of the sketches are brilliant (usually the ones featuring Nick Frost) and some are Saturday Night Live-like in their idiocy and those are usually the ones that, also in SNL fashion, are repeated so often you want to scream (if I hear that guy cry one more time...). It feels like the writers were rushing to meet a deadline or something. They are clearly talented and the actors and actresses themselves are generally very good but about half of it falls short in my opinion. Yes, it's worth the money. Yes, if you are a fan of British comedy check it out. Yes, if you love the Simon Pegg-Nick Frost projects check it out. But there are far better things out there."
2,Same as any,"The show is great, this video is not. You can go anywhere and pick up a workout DVD and it will basically be the same."
3,Good for people that are starting in exercise,"It is good but I am an advanced exerciser so I found the work outs a little ""slow"" for me.It burns a lot of calories."
3,dvd,"I like this dvd...has a few different workouts to choose from, which is nice. I would recommend this to people beginning a work out program."
2,Kind of boring,"I found the workouts to be really repetitive. There are very few kinds of movements, you just do the same things over and over again. I found it boring, and not very challenging."
4,Its a Keeper,"This DVD has 5 different programs. You get 2 cardio segments 20 minutes a piece, a weights segment also 20 minutes, a bootcamp segment also 20 minutes, and a stretch segment which is only 10 minutes. The workouts are actually pretty challenging. The quality of the workouts are good, but there are a couple of reasons why I give this 4 stars instead of 5. This is very high impact. If you have joint problems this is not the DVD for you. There is ALOT of jumping. Also, this must have been recorded before the finale because the cast of former contestants were visibly unable to keep up on some of the exercises. Also, sometimes they would be going at a different pace, or be on a different foot, than Bob the trainer. These things can be pretty distracting. The versatility of this DVD is a big selling point. You can choose just one segment, or you can mix & match. Its really very user friendly. So, for the intensity of the workouts & the versatility of this DVD I give it 4 stars."
5,Excellent Workouts,"I bought this mostly because I thoroughly enjoyed the show and definately preferred Bob's training style over Jillian's. I consider myself intermediate/advanced when I purchase workouts. After doing this workout the day I received - - I can definately see why the participants lose weight in the show. This is an EXCELLENT workout and it made me SWEAT. I programmed 60 minutes of workout my first time out and this definately will burn calories and get your heart pumping. The fact you can program what you wish to do is a wonderful feature that you don't receive with workouts costing twice this price. For this price you definately can't go wrong. This is definately a ""keeper"" workout in my workout regimen."
4,The Biggest Loser Workout,"This workout provides a good vehicle to become physically fit. With varying levels of intensity, there's practically something for everyone. It's light-hearted and fun. Caution, the music can be cheesy, and the transitions aren't very smooth. All in all, this DVD is a nice addition to most fitness libraries."
4,Good Workout.,This DVD workout is good. I only gave it 4 starts because I have only dont one workout so far.I started with the begginer workout. It was a good workout. I was sweating like never before. I cant wait to get to the other workouts.I like the fact that I could follow along right off the bat. The moves have modified versions incase you need them.Bob is a nice trainer. He is very encouraging. He is always reminding you to do what you can and to hold in your abs.I would reccomend this dvd to anyone who wants to start at a good easy pace and work up.I like the fact that the cast couldnt keep up...I didnt feel like I was alone.
3,"Okay video, but not much for motivation","I bought this because I was getting bored with my normal exercise videos. I had the ""Extreme Makeover"" beginner's DVD, but couldn't find one for the next level. I thought this might be the same type of video, but I found it really dry and boring. The exercises are okay, but I have a hard time coming back to it for some reason. You alternate between two different workouts for three weeks, then alternate between two other workouts for the next three weeks. I should explore it more, but at this point, I'm not impressed by it."
5,This is way beyond outstanding,I've never been one to stick to an exercise video/dvdBut this one I have!I love the 4 different workouts and you can even make a custom workout. It's awsome. Bob is the absolute best! He is so encouraging and makes me want to work out. I actually look forward to it now!
1,"disappointment, will not use it again","The first Biggest Loser video that I ever purchased and worked out to was the Cardio Max. I was so crazy about it that I decided to incorporate the Power Sculpt, which was another winner. These workouts make you sweat like crazy and you'll really feel like you had a great workout. I alternate these and workout six times a week. Now, I'm no skinny minnie, in fact, I have about 100 pounds that I would like to lose. But I wanted to expand my B.L. library and bought this video, Biggest Loser Workout 1, and was really disappointed. This workout was boring and repetitious. I didn't sweat ANYWHERE near the previous two. I couldn't believe that this workout was from the same people. So, If you love the Cardio Max or the Power Sculpt, you may not want to waste your money on this one, unless you're looking for a lighter workout."
3,A bit hard on the knees!,"I just got this DVD and as someone who hasn't exercised in I don't know how long, decided to try the ""low impact cardio"" to start off with. It is REALLY hard on the knees. Bob spends a lot of time in this 20 min. segment doing lunges and squats, both which are hard on the knees (and I didn't consider myself to have ""bad knees"") but it was really difficult. Another thing is it's hard to keep time, because you'll see Bob maintaining a certain rhythm, then they'll cut away to another person, then when they cut back to Bob, he's at a different pace. He's really motivational which is nice, but I just wish they didn't focus SO much on lunges. I think I'll be on this segment for a while before even attempting the ""high impact cardio"". It definitely makes you break a serious sweat though and I REALLY feel it today!"
5,I've tried them all!,I have tried many exercise programs and I must admit that this one is one of the best! The have a 6 week program that allows you to reach that marked 6 week goal to see exactly where the program leads you. The people are REAl meaning there are no experts doing the exercises they are people like you and I. In the beginning of the video you get to see where they came from so that you to can change like they did. If you've ever invested your money in a program this one is worth it!
5,Great workout video,This is a great workout video. Working out with Bob and Kim is such motivation. I am having fun doing the exercises with them and the crew of the Biggest Loser. I would definately recommend this video
4,i like it,This DVD was just what I needed. I like how you can break a sweat without being confused with the moves in the work out. I also liked the feature of turning off the trainer or having the trainer in the workouts. Bob could get a little annoying. But overall it was a good pick for someone who does not like to work out in a class or at all.
4,Great Workout,This is motivating and fun. Bob is great! I would have rated this 5 stars if it had focusused on the abs a bit more. All in all I feel better mentally and physically after doing this workout for a week so far and can't wait to see the results.
3,"Good Sweat, Bad On Knees","This is a great workout if you have some pounds to shed, and you have good knees. I really wanted to like this DVD, and the bits I can do, I find wonderful. However, I have a damaged Achilles tendon and at my weight (I have 100 lbs to lose), the extended series of deep lunges followed by squats, by more lunges are just impossible and painful for me. But, when I am about 1/2 way to my goal, I suspect I will return to this one. While the participants are often out of synch with the trainer, I found that nice... real... not a bunch of perfect robotic followers."
4,biggest loser,"This tape has some good strength building workouts, but to me the aerobics part of it is kind of joint pounding, I perfer to use it only periodically, The Firm is a much better all around workout."
4,FEEL THE BURN!,"I just received this DVD and have done the first workout- warmup, low-intensity, cool down. I was in the military for three years and got out just over a year ago and began to lose my svelte figure. I am very athletic and thought the forst workout would be ""easy"". Well, two days later I'm still sore! It was great fun, really got my heart rate up and made me sweat! Bob is soo encouraging, albeit a little cheesy. My only complaint is that the demonstrators can't stay in time with the music, Bob, or eachother, so it's easy to get distracted and mess up. Other than that they're great! I highly reccomend this to exercisers of all levels."
4,good work out,"I really like this tape, I had read the reviews on this website before and figured I would give it a try. The lunge segment is crazy but good, no pain, no gain! I have to agree with some of the others though, in that because they are ""regular"" people, they are all moving at different paces. I think you just need to focus on one person and keep that pace and you will be fine..the other good thing is you can customize a workout to fit any time frame because there are several segments to choose from.."
5,bob is great,I enjoy this workout a lot. I wish the transition from each section went a bit faster but that is my only complaint.
5,Love it!,I Love this Workout. The Low intensity workout is a challange as well as the high-intensity and boot camp. It is something people who have never worked out before can do and something for people who work out frequently. I highly recommend this workout. I call see and feel the muscles (especially my arms and legs) toning up. I try to do either the strnegth and sculpt or the boot camp every day along with another form of cardio and it is the best workout I have ever done.
4,Good DVD for on the road,Bought this video at the same time as the Biggest Winner exercise set. This video has four workouts on a single DVD so one can do the Cardio workouts while on the road and save the weights for at home. The workouts include warmups and cooldowns and get the heart rate up.
3,It's Okay,"Bob is a great trainer and the actual workout part of it is okay. I'm mid-advanced level but still felt like I got a good ""toning"" workout.However, the group doesn't stay together so it's distracting. I wish it wasn't sooooo casual. They follow him but not like the usual workout you see on tapes..."
2,Biggest Loser Workout,It was hard to follow. The music didn't follow the workout at all. It just wasn't what I thought it would be.
1,Disappointed - Jillian is Better,"After working out for 3 weeks to Jillian's 30 Day Shred; I found this video in my local library and thought I'd give it a try. As much as the show was touted it would be a good change....RIGHT. I was disappointed, thankfully I rented this DVD.I only made it as far as the Sculpting Workout. What a laugh. There are no compound moves....nothing. It is so easy. I never even broke a sweat. After that I didn't pursue it any further; I returned the DVD. Jillian's 30 Day Shred it so much better: you will break a sweat, you will feel the burn and start to see the difference. Thank god I only rented this."
2,Not Pleased,"I only tried the warm-up and the Low Cardio workout. You could hardly hear the background music, but it didn't matter because there is no rhythm at all to the exercises they are doing. I consider myself to be seasoned at working out to aerobics, and I have to have a beat, and a rhythm. Everyone was doing their own thing, and I thought I'd be able to follow Bob, but he just mainly walked around and did not lead. I was extremely disappointed and will most likely return the DVD."
2,Too Hard On The Knees!!!!,"I bought this workout for my husband. He said that he doesn't like it because its too much stress on his knees (lunges, jumping). I'm glad I'm able to return it. Beware if you have bad knees, even if you don't, be careful!"
2,the biggest loser,"while this is a good excercise, it is very hard on old knees. I had to quit after 6 days as my knees were so sore that they wolud barely bend."
3,NOT for everyone,"I have degenerative and weight-related knee problems and was unable to use this video due to the excessive amount of side-to-side work. I had, wrongly, figured that a Biggest Loser workout would be adapted for plus-size people and their associated limitations.If you do not have joint problems this would be a good beginner to intermediate workout."
5,"Best work out for beginners, end of story!","This is my absolute favorite workout DVD. I've tried pilates, yoga, and tae bo, but to me nothing is better than good ole fashioned cardio and strength training. I am young, but a beginner and very out of shape. I bought this for the purpose of losing weight. This DVD will make me sweat and really work, but not to the point where I can barely stand for the rest of the day. I also like that is has the 6 week plan of 4 different work outs. Bob is AMAZING. Most trainers get on my nerves after about 5 minutes, but I actually look forward to ""working"" with him each day. He's very motivational and just plain awesome. He also makes everything very easy to understand. I have been doing this video plus a good diet for a week and am already starting to see some changes in my energy as well as muscle tone. This is a keeper."
5,It really works!,"Let me just say, this video changed my life! I was so frustrated with workout videos featuring perfectly coordinated ""Stepford Barbies"". Like I didn't feel bad enough about being overweight and out of shape! Enter the Biggest Loser video....finally one with real people, with real bodies....what I love about this video is that they are in various states of weight loss, and are wheezing and sweating right along with me! I think it's great that they are not all in step with each other; but they always keep trying. And Bob never fails to elicit a smile from me, his energy and laughter are infectious (even through the pain!). It's also nice that you can mix and match the workouts, depending on your time and needs. This video, along with the book, have helped me to lose 25# in 2 months, and it's something I intend to stick with until I wear the disc out!!!! :)"
4,I love The Biggest Loser,"I love the show The Biggest Loser! Now I love this workout video!! It has shown me new moves and new muscles to work, that I don't work with other routines! I would recommend this video to anyone looking for a healthier lifestyle!"
3,Good and bad,"I'm not overweight nor do I have any major health problems. But this video was VERY challenging in good ways and bad:Good:-you can customize your workout-you will DEFINITELY work up a sweatBad:-it is hard to ""keep up"" because the participants are constantly changing the rhythm of the routine-on that same note, the fact that the participants are having a hard time keeping up is a distraction.-the guy is pretty annoying. there were times where I wished he would just go away.-it was REALLY hard on my knees (i haven't had knee issues since running track in high school and even then they didn't have this much stress on them).Overall, I'm not sure if I'd purchase this again given the opportunity. But now that I have it, I'll make the best of it."
3,Just Okay Workout Video,"I have been doing aerobics for years and thought I would try this video just to keep my workouts interesting. While I did sweat and found certain parts to be challenging, I was not that impressed. I thought that there was too much repetition of the same movements....I don't want to do a ""step touch"" move for 5 minutes. Plus, at the end of the low-intensity cardio, they do lunges and squats for an eternity. I consider myself to be in pretty good shape and I couldn't even finish all the lunges and squats. In addition, it was annoying that everyone on the video was going at a different pace. At least if Bob would have kept doing the workout, I could have just followed him, but he stops to go look around at everyone else."
3,biggest loser workout,"I liked this workout video, however, I got bored with it easily. But it was a good workout until I became bored. Love the show!"
5,The best workout ever!!!,"I loved this workout DVD, not only do you have many to choose from but just when you think you might not be able to finish the workout Bob looks right into the camera and says don't quit you can do it. I have lost 30 lbs in 2 months and I have never felt better."
4,Great for my new years resolution,"I have several workout video's/DVD's, etc. But this one is really different and fun. It's nice to workout with ""real people"" and not skinny mini professionals. It's fun to watch when Matt screws up in the routine and laughs about it. Some reviewers on this site said it was confusing, but I feel its easy to follow the verbal instructions of Bob Harper and you can go at your own pace. I have mainly put my own packages together with cardio and strenth training combos, which is great to be able to mix it up. Its probably most fun for those who are fans of the show (like me), but if you don't like typical workout videos this would be good to try as well."
4,Pretty Good Workout,I've only tried the high intesity cardio and the bootcamp sections of the DVD....Pretty good workout! Too bad it only lasts for 20 mins! I realized that you may enjoy it more if turn on your own music and work out to it. This DVD is perfect for people that are crunched for time and that like to workout in the morning.
4,Very Pleased,"I have loved this workout DVD. Bob keeps you motivated and it is nice that the ""biggest losers"" are uncoordinated and struggling in areas. Makes it feel as if you aren't the only one. I do hope that they have a follow up DVD that will have 1 hour long workouts because a 1/2 hour doesn't seem to do it after a while. All in all it was been a wonderful motivating workout and I love that there are 4 different ones to choose from."
3,Biggest Loser Video,I really enjoyed the video. You get an intensive workout in a short period of time. I also liked that you don't need extra equipment to do the video. My only complaint is that the cardio portion is very hard on the joints. If you don't have joint problems this is a great video.
5,Great Workout,This DVD is convinent because it allows the user to change the workouts to their level.
3,Decent Workout,"Being a fan of The Biggest Loser, I was excited about buying this DVD in 2009 and ready to get back in shape. Even though I wasn't in good shape, I didn't find this workout very challenging. Also, it was a bit on the boring side. The same held true for the other 3 TBL workout DVDs that I bought. They are designed for people who really are in poor physical condition. If you're in horrible shape and long to workout with the trainers from the show, then this workout is for you.If you can walk to your car without getting winded or pulling a hamstring, I strongly recommend P90X. It's quite challenging and filled with variety. There's a different workout for each night. Tony Horton is much more engaging than Bob or Jillian. Though I have to modify nearly half of the moves, I'm getting good results so far with regard to strength, flexibility and weightloss (averaging 3 - 5 lbs each week). You'll never get bored with these workouts. Check out Tommy Mygrant's story - [...]"
5,Great dvd,Loved this!! One of my favourites. Different than your regular exercise dvd's and guess what - it works.I have a hard time sweating and this did the job! I am also a big fan of turbo jam...intense cardio workout!!!!
4,Good Solid Basic Workout,"I am a big fan of The Biggest Loser, and wanted to do the same workout as the contestants, hoping to get their same results. The workouts are good and solid, and if you follow the recommended schedule, you will get good results. Although the ""real people"" are inspiring, their form in performing the exercises is not always good, so you might get thrown off. Watch Bob do the exercises and you'll be fine.The ""custom workout"" option is a great feature; do the low intensity followed by the weight training after you've gotten accustomed to the workout, and you'll feel great!After 4 weeks I can get through the low-intensity and the weight training segments; the high intensity and boot camps are still a little strenuous for me. But I'm losing and toning, and feeling good doing the DVD, and nothing succeeds likes success!"
4,A Good Workout for Beginners,I have been using the DVD and referencing the book for about three weeks now. I feel better and have increased by strength. I like Bob's approach to getting fit. I would recommend.
5,awesome,I like this workout dvd. Beginners to advance people can use this tape and still get a great work out. I have enjoyed it.Has sculpting along with aerobic workouts.
5,Watch Out Billy Blanks! This will get your heart going!,"Let me preface this by saying I'm a huge TaeBo fan. I mean huge. I bought the original infomercial set, then did TaeBo Live, paid to watch the TaeBo workouts on DirecTV in 2000, have the Get Ripped series and just bought the Boot Camp. So you get the idea...I like TaeBo and I don't stray that often to try something new.I was completely blown away by this DVD! The high intensity cardio workout rivals, if not exceeds, any and I mean ANY TaeBo workout I've ever done. The trainer is effecient and so are your moves and the entire workout. Not a single wasted motion. Not a one.If you are a workout fanatic or just thinking about it, this DVD needs to be in your library. If you don't believe the almost perfect 5 star rating this DVD has earned on Amazon, then rent it first. Once you do, you will be impressed. I'm sure of it."
3,Has it worked for anyone?,"Just checking to see if anyone has benefited by this DVD as far as weight loss/toning? I recently ordered it and am awaiting its arrival. I'm really anxious to start it once it arrives! I only gave it a ""3"" because I have yet to receive it."
4,Tough workout,"I liked this workout, especially the bootcamp segment. It was nice to see that even the participants were having a little difficulty and feeling the ""pain"". However, I am now back to working out with Denise Austin."
3,Great Workout,"I enjoyed the challenge of this dvd and the fact that they used people who I watched being transformed into their new selves. It's easy to follow along and Bob is a great instructor. The only complaint that I have is when you make your own workout plan, you have to keep reprogamming your plan into the dvd."
5,The Biggest Loser Workout is a real Winner!,"This workout has been a real motivating factor behind my weight loss. The people are real, the workouts are real. Bob, the trainer is an absolute doll!! Don't hesistate one minute when considering buying this dvd!! You won't be disappointed!!"
4,Good workout,"The Biggest Loser workout DVD is a good one. It has several workouts to choose from, although I've only done the warm-up and low-impact workout with trainer, Bob. I find it a little hard to stay with the music, because it's hard to hear the music over Bob talking. I think there's an option to use music only, though. I would caution, however, to think twice about buying this if you have knee problems. Bob includes LOTS of lunges and some squats and I am having some knee pain. Maybe my form is just wrong, I'm not sure. I am happy with my purchase, though. It's a good way to get your cardio in on a cold winter day when you can't get outdoors to exercise. I'm sure my heart is thanking me."
4,Pretty good exercise dvd,"Its a fun dvd and Bob is a hoot, his laugh makes you laugh. I'm not into lunges as they hurt my knees (too much running in the past) however its a great fun workout."
4,Gotta Remember,"I really like this product, but if you plan on loosing weight on it alone i would check another route. After all on the TV show they didn't juct workout in front of a tv, they ran, walked, tredmilled, elipticaled, and so on along with it. just a thought."
5,GREAT BOOK!,"I loved this book. Great advice, particularly for first-timers like me. Our daughter was only 12 mos. when I read it, but I will definitely use it as she grows-the few times I have been able to apply the technique I've been pleasantly surprised by the result. I loaned it to a friend with a 6 yr. old and now I WANT IT BACK! I'd recommend it to anyone."
1,Got Belt?,"It used to be called ""belt on the behind"".Now we write books, and lets talk it all out.And everyone wonders why kids are so out of control like never before today.Every generation can say, to a point, certain problems with kids, but this latest one.by far and away the most limp wristed bunch of men are turning out, and we need to all read books and find out why, and at the same time ""the belt"" has been kept buckled.1 plus 1 equals what?I raised mine the same as my parents raised me, and that is, most of the time, all you had to do is unbuckle the belt, and that was plenty warning.Nobody needed any Supernanny Joe Frost before, and interesting how she never goes back after a year for a follow up with any of the families.what's wrong with NO? Oh I must find a BOOK!"
4,Yet another interesting text on this area,Enjoyable book to read. Great illustrations. Very informative with regard to this area of collecting. I would recommend this book to others.
2,"Looks great, but doesn't work.","This timer has a great retro red style, but the buzzer doesn't work on the one that I just purchased. Pass up this disappointment."
4,does the job,this is good especially for the 2 bucks i paid. it's not that loud but loud enough for me.
2,buy another...,The timer buzzes really low and for a short 1-1.5 seconds. It's easy to miss when it goes off if you're in another room.
1,spend a little more money and get a better quality timer,"The design is poor and the ring is less than 1-2 seconds long. The timer on my microwave does a better job. If I bought this locally, I would take it back.Typhoon Buick Red Timer"
5,Love the Look!,"I bought this for the look but found that as a bonus, it really works well. The bell is loud and fairly long ringing and I am very pleased."
5,All You Need to Know about Work Based Learning,"I enjoyed the book immensely for a variety of reasons. Among the reasons: it filled in my own understanding of Work Based Learning; it combines a nice balance between theory and practice; and, the organization of the book was excellent.The book is comprehensive; solid; impressive in its breadth and depth; and, written confidently by an expert in the field.Kudos to Joe Raelin for helping us business types so readily understand all sides of Work Based Learning."
3,Some good information but not great writing,"I have mixed feelings about this book.I ordered it because I was considering a work based learning business degree. And, I have to say, the information in the book was very useful. (I carefully read the first half of the book and then skimmed the second half.) If I graded this book on content alone, I'd give it five stars.Nevertheless, the writing isn't great. I write professionally myself and publish books that cover similarly complex subjects. And the writing in this book is just barely acceptable. Too many buzzwords. Complicated sentence structures. Too many paragraphs with no topic sentences. For the less than friendly writing, I give it one or two stars... Hence the three-star averageMy bottomline suggestion? If you really want the information, you'll probably be quite satisfied with this book. But because of the stilted, academic style, you'll work much harder in your reading than you should have to work."
1,garbage,"Full of lies and distortion. Read if you're a fan, but take what's said with a grain of salt."
5,Great Book,"I was never really a Ric Flair fan, but something really told me to check this book out. Once I started reading it, I was surprised at how interesting the book really is. Ric's stories were great, and it also gives you another insight of the wrestling business. I found Flair's comments about Bret Hart and Mick Foley surprising, but true. Being a Bret Hart fan, he was never realy a great champion. Being a Mick Foley fan, he did do ridiculous things to make him look like a glorified stuntman. At times in the book, Flair did come off as being somewhat cocky, but I guess that's the Nature Boy for you. Great book."
3,Worth A look,After reading this book I have to say at first that I was never a Ric Flair Fan or Never will be but this book had alot of truth to it especially in his early days but I felt soon after I reached the end of his book that he seems bitter at all the Wrestlers that he ever worked with in WCW mostly including DDP not being over with the fans and some other wrestlers that he metioned even if you a Ric Flair Book I still recommend to read this book because he holds no punches unlike some of the other WWE books
4,Solid Transaction,"The book was as advertised and the shipping process went smoothly and professionally, on time. My only disappointment was in the book itself-- he had so many great experiences that I would have preferred more on that and less on the seamy activities he engaged in away from the ring."
3,Wooooooo,"Ric Flair has seen and done it all in wrestling. I like the fact that he's willing to lay it all out here in great detail. Next to HAVE A NICE DAY by Mick Foley, I would recommend this book to the reader of wrestler autobiographies."
5,Best Wrestling book out there,"If you are interested in reading a book by a wrestler, this is the one to read. I have read Hogan's and Dusty Rhode's as well as several others, but this book is by far the most realistic, seemingly true account of 1980's wrestling. For as much as Flair has accomplished in the wrestling world, he would have every right to talk about how he built the business and he is larger than the business. He does not though, which makes this book so much more enjoyable."
3,Woooo!,"Simple, fun read... especially for a long-time wrestling fan. I wanted to get it signed by the Nature Boy himself in Robstown, TX in September of 2008, but couldn't make it to the meet-and-greet before the NWA bouts later that night. Only fans will enjoys this, and I did. Great photos added to this edition as well... full color pages with pics spanning his long career. Wooooo!"
4,A Surprisingly Good Read,"I am not a big Ric Flair fan. Or I wasn't a big Flair fan back in his WCW days. I never tuned into WCW and have only caught up on Flair's history in wrestling through this book, his dvd set and WWE 24/7. I have grown to like the Nature Boy. Even though his book did create some controversy with his harsh words about Mick Foley and others, it gives you insight into the man and wrestler. If I could I would rate this as a 4 and a half stars out of five. The only wrestling book I think is a 5 star is Mick Foley's Have A Nice Day. This is close to being perfect (about on the same level as Mick's sequel Foley Is Good). You might not agree with everything the man says, but this book does what it intends to : entertain and inform. Highly recommended more for Flair/WCW fans or those who want to learn about the history of the business and one of the biggest stars to come along in the wrestling industry."
4,Truly the greatest of all time,"You may not like or agree with everything Ric Flair says but you can't argue that he has earned the right to say it. This book was a No Holds Barred look at the Nature Boy's life. It gives you a real inside look at his triumphs and tribulations in his business. As a life long fan of Ric Flair, as I read this it brought back memories, I laughed and at times I almost cried.He pulls no punches and tells it the way he sees it on everyone from Eric Bischoff to Hulk Hogan to Triple H. After reaing it you get the feeling that this book only scratches the surface. A man who has lived a life like that has so much more to say, so many more stories to tell. I look forward to reading more from The Nature Boy in the future.I withold one star as I am a tremendous Mick Foley mark."
2,a lot of bashing and ass-kissing,"He bashes people like bret, mick, sid, ddp, savage, hogan, scott hall. He kisses vince, hbk, hhh's ass a lot. Notice something? People he bashes are no longer in the WWE and people he ""likes"" or ""respects"" are top guys in the WWE. He also speaks a lot about Arn like he's one of the best wrestlers of all time which he clearly is not, I watch tons of wrestling but never see him appear on wresting videos or even if he does appear once or twice I fail to recognize who he is. I understand he is your buddy but come on nobody really wants to know about him but you keep repeating he is great, blah, blah, blah. And yes we know you are a womanizer so spare your stoires of how many women you have they are just disgusting, believe it or not he really takes pride in his womanizing which makes me sick. Don't read the book, he just writes to kiss some ass but hardly the truth."
1,Lies!!!!!!!!,"this book is full of lies and nothing but to promote the current WWE further. Flair sees mcmahon's favorite wrestlers like hbk and triple h as great wrestlers and those who opposed vince are bad wrestlers. Attacking wrestlers such as foley, hart, and savage are just plain wrong. He's NOT better than any of those three. Any wrestling fans knows what those 3 have done for the business. Mick, Bret, and Savage sacrificed a lot just to entertain people. Bret even cared for the well fare of his fellow wrestlers. The only entertaining thing flair can do is his ""WOO!"" chant which gets boring after hearing it a few times. As of now, Flair is still in the WWE and I must admit that I am bored everytime I watch him fight."
1,This book is about as entertaining as a Ric Flair match,"Ric Flair is a terrible repedative boring wrestler. For him to bad mouth great entertainers(wrestlers) like Mick Foley and Bret Hart in this book is a joke. They have done more for the business then Flair ever will no matter how long he stays, and he has over stayed his welcome by about 10-15 years.Flairs move list OFFENCE 1. Chest slap 2. Punch 3. Figure Four Leglock 4. No wait thats it, just 3 moves .DEFENCE 4.Bump of the top rope(atleast 3 times a match) 5. Back body drop. Repeat steps 1-3 if necassary"
1,Joel likes this so its stupid,i like ric flair alot but when i found out joel likes him i hated ric flair joel and him meet every saturday in robes naked and rub each others crotches on each others legs. im swear im telling the truth
2,WWE Hype Machine At It's Worst,"This book had promise, then Vinny Mac and crew had to work their way into it. In all, the book is not a bad read, there were just some parts that baffled me to death.The nerve of Flair to bash the likes of Savage, Bret Hart, and Foley to name a few is puzzling. He could of stated he didn't like neither style, but he went on to trash their accomplishments in the business, that's classless and unlike the Flair I watched and read about. It gets better, the talk of veterans needing to put younger guys over, but then praising long time politicians like Undertaker, Triple H, and Shawn Michaels, guys who would rather pass kidney stones and cancer tumors, than put anyone else over. That's when you can tell, it's the WWE spin machine.In conclusion, it's up to you if you want to purchase, but beware, alot of wacky WWE spin is on display. The stories of the old days are worth the buy, I will admit!"
3,Great Tips,"This is a pretty good book. Ric Flair says it like it is:1. How to book yourself into 16 championships and how to pace a match unlike Triple H and Dusty Rhodes... Ric says it hte right way.2. How to grow great man boobs over the years.3. How to dance and style and profile and it already benefited a guy like Eugene on Raw bouncing around in his office like a stud! Eugene is going to be a legend like Ric.4. How to not create a lousy stable like Evolution... Ric sums it up in one second... a stable sucks when you don't have Arn Andersen running the Harsemen!5. How to supply the best chops money can buy!Overall, this book speaks the truth and nothing but the truth!"
1,ric fare,my mommy read me this book last night and i had nightmares. It was very scarry about some wressler named ric fair. I told my mommy never to wread this story to me ever again. rick flaer is a scary man.
5,Wrestling As Literature,"A stunningly candid,superbly edited, endlessly entertaining, really-tell-all piledriver of a book! Fans of the AWA will be entranced. See how Flair and Ken Patera trained in sub-zero temperatures on Verne Gagne's farm. You are there when Flair wrestles his first match on December 10, 1972, working to a draw with George ""Scrap Iron"" Gadaski. (Fans of the AWA love Scrap Iron!) You will learn a little about the evil Tennessee Children's Home Society in Memphis, and gasp had how hated Johnny Valentine was by other wrestlers (Page 53. It's unbelievable!)Sometimes the editing gets sloppy in books of this nature (like Christy Canyon's, ""Lights, Camera, Sex!""), but not here. ""To Be the Man"" is visually appealing, and that matters. I recommend this book!"
3,"Didn't love it, didn't hate it.","Not bad. Reading about the life of a true legend like The Nature Boy was enjoyable. However, theres quite a few irritating typos and a tendancy to rant and rave about other wrestlers that occasionaly makes him sound like a bitter old geezer. At times you can almost picture him waving a cane and telling Mick Foley to get off his lawn. A good read if youre a Ric Flair fan. If not it probably won't convert you."
4,To be the man you have to beat the man...,"...and the man when it comes to wrestling biographies is still Mick Foley.Flair's book is a good read, but it doesn't quite match up against Foley's books or Fred Blassie's for that matter.Still, reading about the Nature Boy's adventures and misadventures over the course of his career is a must-read for any true wrestling fan."
4,"Durability an issue, but we like it all the same","I enjoy Karen Katz' illustrations, we have 3 of her books, and my toddler has been taken with this one in particular ever since we got it. We tried to read it with her only when supervised, but still we have lost a few flaps which must be glued back in place. Lift-the-flaps are so enticing for little ones, I wish they made them more durable."
3,Fun book but the flaps come off quickly,"My 13 month old loves learning about body parts, so this book is a lot of fun for him. Unfortunately, the flaps he is supposed to lift are not thick like the pages of a board book, but rather thin like a piece of thick paper. As a result, they were hard at first for him to get his chubby little fingers onto (until he bent them out of shape so much that they no longer lay flat!), and they were easily ripped."
5,Great peek-a-boo book,"My toddler was given this book when she was about 18 months old. With it, she discovered that there is more to peek-a-boo then simply hiding and revealing your FACE - you can also hide your hands, feet, bellybutton, etc.She still loves the book a year later, and has started ""reading"" it to her baby brother."
3,Cute but will not last long...,"Based on the reviews I bought this for my baby, I'm disappointed in how flimsy the flaps are. They will tear off in no time, especially with a boy that likes to get into everything. I'd be willing to pay more for something that will last a long time, hopefully the anniversary edition that's coming out will incorporate this change(?)"
4,Great book...flimsy pages!,"My 7 month old loves this book! When I show it to him he smiles andsqueals with delight. As most of of know, 7 month olds not only delight in the words and the pictures, but they like to feel and taste the story as well! This book is not holding up. The ""lift flaps"" are very thin and seem like they are going to tear off of when my baby lifts them. I guess I'm just used to his other favorite book, ""What Does Baby Do"" another lift the flap book by Begin Smart. That (like all of their books) is VERY durable! I suppose we'll just have to be very gentle with ""Where Is Baby's Belly Button?"" It is a great book, however I wish it was more durable so it could last for our next child!"
3,"Cute idea, but not sturdy enough for babies,","I will say that my daughter did like this book. It's a ""peek-a-boo"" type book. The problem is that, of course, babies want to open and close the flaps themselves, and these flaps are thin, flimsy and hard for little baby fingers to get a hold of (and avoid ripping or curlling once they do). Many of our flaps are missing, but the kids still read this book from time to time.It would be better if it was a little sturdier."
4,"Enjoyable Illustrations, but...","I bought this book because it came highly recommemnded and was one of AZ's best sellers. The only suggestion I have is that be careful giving this book to a toddler to look at themselves. Since the book has flaps that reveal ""Where things are"" they are easily ripped out. My daughter is 11 months old and I thought this would the perfect introduction to books. This may be considered a little young but she absolutely LOVES books and likes turning pages. That is why we opt for board books in the very beginning because the pages can be easily turned and are more durable than regular childrens'[paper] books. My only warning is if you do buy this book and your child likes to tear/pull things, beware. Or just wait until they are older and know not to. Otherwise, you are in for alot of ripped flaps."
2,not very durable,"I bought this for my 11-month-old granddaughter after reading high ratings and it lasted all of 10 minutes before a flap was torn off. She loves the pictures and it's a good book for learning parts of the body, but not one for a baby to handle if you want it to stay intact."
3,Fun book to read with your child,My son is 14 months and he really likes this book. We have lost a few of the flaps because the flaps are thin and difficult for a 14 month old to lift. My son has points to his body parts when we read this book together. Over all it's a fun book to read with your child.
1,Book was Damaged,"While the story of the book, itself, is great. The copy I recieved had water damage and some of the picture flaps were missing. The book was basically useless. I just tossed it as it wasn't readable and was missing parts. Given the cost, it wasn't worth my time to return. Just a lesson... and I moved on."
5,Gave as Christmas present last year,I purchased this for my niece who loved flipping the tabs up. She really began to learn words and all that. Would reccommend for early learning.
2,Cute book but flaps flimsy,The biggest problem with this book is that the flaps are too flimsy. My twins love to read books on their own and the flaps are already bend out of shape. The book itself is cute.
5,Very cute story,"Very cute story, the story is very charming, our one year old loves it. A good find for a reasonable price."
2,This book left me hollow,"Where is baby's belly button? Around the location of the navel.I read this book. It didnt take me long. I found that it left me empty inside. There was no coherent structure to be found, and it is never really explained where the baby came from or why it should feel the need to locate various anatomical features.Aside from that, the flaps were fun."
3,Book was o.k.,"Toddler girl liked it for about 2 minutes. Cute book but could've used some brighter, fun colors. Child seemed to lose interest quickly. And this little girl loves books!!"
4,I like Katz's artwork a lot,"Very round, very cute, very... childlike, for lack of a better word.And I always appreciate the effort in making a multiracial cast of kids, not everybody does that.Would be nice if the flaps were a little stronger, though. Unfortunately, they *will* rip off, so this book has to be supervised only :("
3,cute but needs to be fixed often,My daughter is 9 months and likes the book. The only thing is she rips the flaps like nothing! My husband has already fixed three flaps. They are on pretty good once we tape them back on so it's not a big issue. Maybe they should have made them with velcro or something since babies pull on pages? Cute book but make sure you have tape :)
4,Great book,"This book has been a favorite of my daughter's from about 12 months to now, when she is 18 months. She really enjoys turning the flaps and finding the items and then showing where the items (belly button etc.) are located on herself, her teddy bear, etc. Good value for money. She sometimes tear off a flap, and that is the only reason I do not give this item 5 stars, but the flaps are pretty easy to tape on again. This book is better than some other lift-the-flap books where it is hard for the infant to see where the flap is."
5,A big hit for my toddler,"This lift-the-flap book quickly became my toddler's favorite book (purchased when she was around 14-15 months old). She loves ""finding"" the hidden pictures under the flaps, and she also loves identifying the corresponding parts of her own body and corresponding items in our home, like clothing, toys and animals. A great buy. We also bought a couple of extras to use as gifts for friends' babies."
2,oh my!,"this book is very colorful... the illistrations are very bright.... my two year old loves books and i purchased this one becuase it came recomended by his speech theropist, however, the flaps are easily torn becasue they are paper... cardbaord books are better for smaller children. It only holds his attention for a very limited time and my three year old won't even attempt to look at it... i know all children are diffrent, and i hope you children likes it better than mine do."
2,flaps torn at first use,"It's definately not for a kid who like to rip into things like magazines, which is odd since this book is meant for babies and all babies do that. The flaps on each page were torn off on first use."
4,Cute!,"This is a cute little book! All babies love to touch their nose and belly button...! It's a great way to teach if you aren't using the real parts as examples! : ) The only thing I would say is that the ""peek-a-boo"" flaps are pretty thin for a board book. Just be careful when you are letting baby lift the flaps...Cute!"
4,A favorite,My 18 mos old granddaughter loves this book. She lifts the flaps and then points to those body parts on her own self.
5,Great book,Great kids book. My son is 18 months and loves the flaps on each page. One of his favorite books. Easy for him to understand and follow along with
5,Very Cute Little Book,"This is a very cute little book. Fun to read to baby, fun for baby to copy the baby in the book & find parts of her body. Good to teach baby about her body parts. Lots of fun to read."
5,Love it,"My two years old boy love this book, he learned so much from this book, believer or not your kid will love!"
4,A sweet book,"My daughter is 6 months old and absolutely loves this book. From the start it grabbed her attention. Now when I pull it off the shelf to read, she laughs and gets quite exited. It is her favorite ""interactive"" book so far."
5,18 Months and Still Lifting the Flaps!,"My 18-month old son still loves this book, as well as Where's Baby's Mommy. He has lifted the flaps so much that I've had to tape some of them back together. Its easy to read and point out the body parts on ourselves, too! Beautiful big illustrations. A real necessity in any baby's library!"
3,"We Like Toes, Ears, and Nose Better","These two books - Where Is Baby's Belly Button and Toes, Ears, and Nose are so similar, you only need one of them. And my boys prefer Toes, Ears, and Nose. I'm not sure why, but maybe it's because more body parts are discussed."
4,Fun Book,My daughter is 21months and loves this book. We have had it for several months and she is still not tired of it. She loves to play peek-a-boo with the babies in the book. The only drawback is the flaps are definately not child proof. Our copy is now well taped to repair torn pages. I would throw it away if she didn't love it so much.
3,A Little Disappointed,This book was highly recommended by a friend of mine who's son is the same age as mine. My son liked it for about a day and then he was bored with it. He loves the Sandra Boynton books - he has a bunch of them and is constantly bringing one to me to read to him.
3,Cute book but flimsy.,"This book is cute and my daughter really likes it. Only problem is the pages have little pop ups on them that are made of paper and glued on the page. Needless to say, I am already gluing parts back on the page. They should have made the paper thicker!"
5,#1 Baby Book from 2 months to 2 years,"Baby loves this ""peek a boo"" concept and has been able to interact by lifting the flaps from about 2 months old. Now that he is almost two years the flaps are getting roughed up but we have definitely got our money's worth.Great illustrations, great flaps that are cut in interesting shapes, and lots of vocabulary opportunities as well as hand coordination."
5,"love it, love it, love it","My son (15 months) absolutely loves this book. He will sit and do the flaps over and over and over and over. It has held up really well to his tug and folds (although he was able to eat a corner off a flap!). Great book. Good for working on teaching basic body parts too (hands, feet, nose, eyes, mouth, etc). We liked this book so much we ordered a similar book by the same author (yet to be delivered)."
4,Entertains My 1-1/2 Year Old...,"My 17 month old daughter loves books. I recently bought her a new selection and this was one of them. It keeps her busy and she can study the different pages and recognize body parts such as hands, teeth, etc. She also likes to play peek-a-boo with the baby at the end.My only complaint is that I've had the book for less than a month and with repeated readings a few pieces tore out and I had to tape them back in. I know that is a possibility with little hands and lift-the-flap type of books but I thought this was awful soon. My daughter loves her books and doesn't throw them around or rip or tear at them."
3,Daughter never interested in it,"My daughter has never been interested in this book. She's 21 months old, and we've had it for over a year, but it never seemed to hold her attention. Therefore, I can only give it three stars! She does, however, enjoy the very similar ""Daddy and Me""! Go figure!"
5,21 month old loves it,"My Daughter recieved this book for her first birthday and she still loves it. It's actually VERY sturdy for being a lift the flap book the flaps are sealed across the entire top or bottom of the page in about a half inch strip and are made out of a heavy cardstock type paper not quite board thick but still rather thick.We let her play with all her books whenever she wants even if it means possibly eventually destroying them and this book has stood up very very well. It's over ten months old and has lost only ONE flap and only very recently. She still loves it regardless.The drawings are cute the words are big and clear (we're starting to try to get her to follow along with the words we say by pointing them out). It's a bit short, but right now it doesn't seem to matter she'll read it twice through if she wants more and sometimes it's just the right length."
5,My baby was cracking up laughing!,"I bought this book for my 7 month old daughter, and she loved it! She cracks up everytime we read it together. She is now a year old, and the book is every bit as funny. The squeaks and giggles she makes are priceless!"
2,Disappointed in this Book,I have read countless books on this subject and this was unexpectedly one that I did enjoy reading. It felt like it remained on the surface level and never went deeper. I was greatly disappointed after reading the other reviews. Far too much prayer and focus on Jesus as savior and Christianity for my taste.
5,God's faithfullness,5 starHow His promise never fails us. Having faith as small as a mustard seed an it will be. I enjoy this story very much
3,It probably gives you an idea of what it might have been like..,"My grandmother was German Jewish on her father's side and the child of a secular couple with an interfaith marriage. I am constantly looking for details of people with lives similar to hers which is why I read this book. Even though this book is written from a very Christian perspective, I believe it illustrates well how sorted things got at that time. It is too bad the main character lost almost all her Jewish identity, but that is what happened to my own family as well. As descendents of Jews we can be grateful for the Righteous Gentiles who may have tried to save us.However, I feel this book pushes the issue of conversion to Christianity a little more than I am comfortable with."
1,a.k.a The Blue Man (original title),"I bought this for simply nostalgic reasons. I saw this film on CBC / CTV almost 25 years ago. My chemistry professor (I believe his name was Arthur Grosser) at McGill University had a small roll as the Anthropology or history professor in this film. Also, it was filmed in Montreal, I believe. I did, at the time, have some interest in astral projection and the film, at first, did try to introduce this practice and its appeal.This movie otherwise has nothing of value - strange plot resolution, poor production quality, and poor acting. It can't even qualify as a B-movie since, contrary to the modified title, has no gore or violence for those who might enjoy that sort of thing. Fortunately, Canadian films have improved a lot since the 80s.Oh, and I noticed this time around that Moneypenny had a small role in this film"
1,Biased and largely unsubstantiated arguments,"Burnham in the introduction claims that in conducting research for this book he could not help but divert from his original agenda (which he never really states) and instead produce a book about how the ""Victorian underworld"" and proponents of the ""minor vices"" were successful in infiltrating and eventually winning over popular culture in their quest to become mainstream. It is this blame-assigning viewpoint and use of archaic language that detaches the author from any sense of credibility when speaking about these matters, and indeed it seems (although he never states this) as if he has never experienced any of these horrible vices himself.I would've never read this book had it not been assigned reading in a Society and Engineering course. In short, the book is definitely on interesting subject matter and Burnham does a splendid job in destroying any curiosity or relevance the reader may have had."
1,How to be a jerk while calling other people name,"So you want to condemn other people and not seem like a jerk. Here's how.1. Research only instances of really bad people and claim their vices will have the same results for everyone.2. Ignore all research, including over a hundred years of proof that such vices are good for you.3. Remember that moderation is a myth.4. Blow things out of proportion. Make sure everyone is too guilty to consider how wrong you are with common sense.5. Write a book.Isn't lying about things easy? Doesn't everyone around you feel bad for superstitions made up 400 years ago that are proven to be the opposite? Good for you."
2,You've heard it all before,"If you've just heard Joel Wallach's message through the ""Dead Doctors Don't Lie"" audio cassette some MLMer probably gave to you, don't bother with this video, for a few reasons.First one, being no one in their right mind would take nutritional advice from an overweight, bald man who is very sloppy in his apperance. You get a much better visual from listening on your home stereo.Secondly, I don't think Wallach will ever change his lecture. I've heard Wallach speak on several different occasions, and he uses the same jokes and same stories each time for the most part. Not to say his message isn't a good one. It is, but change it up a little for Pete's sake. How boring must that be for him to say the same speech 200+ times a year?If you're new to the world of alternative medicine, this video can be valuable, but I just can't see how anyone would feel confidence about Wallach's message when you're looking directly at a visual of him. Better to stick with the cassettes and CDs."
2,Don't waste your time,Don't waste your money to buy this book. You can get all the same info off the internet. Not much detail to the book. Would of liked to of learned a lot more about a great race car driver and person that Tim Richmond was.
1,disappointing,"This book is only mildly entertaining and appears to have been researched superficially. It would benefit tremendously from more in depth interviews and anecdotes from Richmonds racing contemporaries. There is very little ""meat"" here. It is a quick read only because there is so little depth."
4,must read for nascar fans,"good book, a must read for a nascar fan. quick read, entertaing, and informing."
3,"When is ... a ""limited budget""?","While the book has excellent design examples, I find it hard to believe that 4 spot colors with a varnish falls into ""limited budget"" category. Limited budget in the Montana market is ""Designer donates time to make cheapskate project look good."" This book has great stuff, but does not fit within limited budget parameters."
3,You get what you pay for,"I have used a number of Sigma lenses throughout the years and I have been quite satisfied. I have a 28 - 300mm lens that I used with my 35mm Canon A2e. A few years ago when I made the switch to digital, I called Sigma and for around $75, they converted the lens to work with my new digital equipment. I have 3 Sigma lenses that I use now. I have had the 18-50mm less than a year and it takes great photos, HOWEVER, when you twist the lens hood off and on the lens, it turns the focusing gear. Mine has stripped out and you can hear gears grinding as the camera tries to focus. Somehow it does still manage to focus but it is slower and quite noisy. I know it is only a matter of time before it stops working altogether. I have replaced this lens with another Sigma, but I chose a higher end model with internal focusing. The 18-50mm would be a great lens at a great price for the occasional user if much care is taken with the hood."
4,Very good for the price.,"I purchased this as a part of a DSLR kit for a family member to learn on. The lens does a decent job hitting the intended target, and is pretty sharp from end to end, with only slightly softer images on the longest end. Light, and plastic, but not bad considering the price point.If you want a good performer for the $$, this one is a good choice."
2,AF Broke within 6 months,Ok lense while it lasted but AF was sketchy for a few weeks before it wouldn't work at all.
2,fantastic bigband music,"I have been a lifelong fan of jazz and bigband music, This is the best record in the genre I know! Fantastic stuff!"
2,Nonstick wore off in one year,"The pan worked well for one year. Now just about everything sticks, even though I coat the pan with oil. I have always followed all of the pan's instructions, including only using rubber utensils. Now I am going to buy a Swiss Diamond 12.5 inch pan, because they actually remain nonstick for life."
1,KitchenAid Non-stick Stir Fry Pan,"After ONE use the non-stick coating is peeling at the rim! If I had saved the box and packing, I would have sent it back. Too bad, the old trusted name brands are not keeping up with quality control. This was a replacement pan for a cheap Wearever that lasted years - bought what I thought was a better one... WRONG!! Too bad there's not an option to give 0 stars or even a -5 stars. I'll probably take the handle off and use as a plant saucer."
3,An okay choice.,"The way it's set up, plain and packed text; and bw pics, it becomes kind of a dry read but the scientific content is fine."
3,Needs a LOT more Chips,The board really is deluxe - the wood is beautifully finished. But there's no where NEAR enough chips - we needed to buy about 4 x the number they give you. THe storage box isn't all that great either and you need something to keep the directions and chips together with the board.
4,Nice powder,I bought it as a gift for my mom. She loves it and asked me to get it for her for Christmas.
1,halston powder,"The powder arrived in its box. On opening the powder container itself, the inner paper lining was broken and powder 'went everywhere'. I was not happy about this. I managed to save about half of the powder and felt it wasn't worth the effort to exchange it as it takes so long."
3,Buy this for the Polovtsian Dances,"This is an intial release of Stokowski's 1964 (I think that was the year) Phase 4 recording of Scheherazade. That particular work has been remastered and clarified on the Cala label and that is the one to buy if you're looking for a great Scheherazade. (Please see my review of that CD). This recording is ""muddy"" and bass-heavy with little of the nuances of the great performance recognizable. Poor engineering on this one. The Cappricio Espagnol suffers from the same problems and some wildly extreme tempos. I fast-forwarded through that one. The real gem here is Borodin's Polovtsian Dances. Soehow the recording survived the problems of the other two. It is a well-paced, well-played, and well-sung (in it's original Russian). The end is thrilling. Program the CD player to play this track only and you'll be satisfied. Don't give up on Scheherazade, just buy the Cala remaster."
3,Bigger than original size,"Shoes are comfortable, but they are bigger than original size. I order size 7 but it feels like a size bigger. Good price anyways."
3,Novels Within a Novel,"If you're looking for a christian romance or interested in genealogy, this book may hit the spot for you. With segments written by four different authors, I found it rather uneven. The concept sounds good, but I just didn't find some of the heroines engaging.It starts as a contemporary romance with Audrey MacMurray taking a genealogy class. She's attracted to the instructor, but backs off when she realizes he's a youth minister. Soured on religion by her missionary parent's abandoment of her, Audrey resists efforts to draw her into the religious activities. As she continues her research, the book jumps to ancestors of hers. This generates several sub-romances set in different periods of Scotland. One character, Celeste, is quite passive, though her growing feelings for her bodyguard mingle with her spiritual growth as he reads the Bible to her."

1,twisted,"This movie is virtually a complete copy of Rock Around the Clock. It looked ordinary, the songs were quite boring- apart from the title track.Did not really enjoy any of it - acting was poor - songs were poor - beinga copy of the rock movie I felt like I was watching the same movie but with poor preformances . Very disappointed."
5,Great Book,This book i s great I am the wife of a band director and I got it to read to my 2 year old twind we love it!
5,Very satisfied,"In the '80's, while I was spinning records, this was a hit for the club I was working in. It also was extremely hard to find!"
3,"Works OK, but . .","Bought this as a gift. It works fine, but its a little loud. Its hard to tell from the picture, but there is a small weight that spins around and drops to make the chimes go off. Fine for busy areas, but would be an annoyance in a bedroom or quiet area."
2,Chime maker stopped working after five days,"I purchased a Kirkland rainbow chime and a double rainbow maker in October for Xmas gifts for adults. Gifts given December 25th. After five days of working properly, the solar unit stopped functioning while the double rainbow maker is still working well on January 7th. I wanted to return the chimes but found Amazon.com's return date expired in November. So what is the use of buying your Xmas presents ahead of time from Amazon if they won't honor the return of a malfunctioning product??? I'll remember this PROBLEM next Xmas season and will probably shop around the stores the old-fashion way or order direct from a manufacturer rather than buing Xmas gifts from Amazon.com.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EZYQ24/ref=oh_o00_s00_i01_details"
1,Stay away,"Stay Away....Piece of junk....does not work........................Junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk, did I mention piece of junk?"
3,great solar idea,"this is my favorite gift to give. However, I have found that it stops working after a few months. Too bad they can't figure out how to keep it working, I would buy a million of them."
2,Chime Rainbow Maker,The gear that is supposed to spin the crystal causing it to strike the chimes failed to engage that gear sliding right by it. Returned for credit. Would purchase again if I could be sure it was going to function properly. The double and single rainbow makers work perfectly. Disappointed that the same cannot be said for the chime version.Jim Borchers
5,it's wonderful!,"The Afterglow works great. It has a nice, thin texture to it that doesn't show on the skin after you've put it on, a plus for a man. You can see results almost immediately, and I have seen a near elimination of ingrown hairs."
4,Pricing is excellent.,"Haven't used them yet, but went by reviews about adhesion being better than most. This review is more about value. I purchased based on the assumption that the reviews reflected the quality; the number of electrodes allowed sharing with my daughter; the quantity for the price was better than most others advertised. This was the best choice to incorporate all three reasons. I didn't rate it higher, as we need to assess the adhesion of these versus others we've used."
2,Don't stick well,These electrode pads just don't stick well at all. I've had to use tape to get them to stay on...they are supposed to be reusable but if they won't stay on then that makes it hard to reuse them! Very disappointed.
3,Hate to be the voice of contention but...,"There are parts of this book that are really great, primarily the beginning section and the end. However, it has too much of a history lesson about it for me. I don't mind when the books are historical, but i could skip whole paragraphs that I felt were in no way connected to the characters. Almost like the author had done all this research and was going to put in what she knew no matter what! Also, there is only so much drama one family can take. I know this book spans many many years but come on! Tey are only happy for about three pages at a time before something else goes wrong! I love the characters, but hated the whole infidelity storyline. I do find something human And redeeming in tessa,s affair, but not gavin's. I would not read this book again or seek out others by this author,"
5,Greatest book I've ever read,I love this book ... It is a great love story and life story. I have read it 3 times and never tire of it. I love Gavin & Tessa - they endure the hard times and come out stronger people for it. Highly recommended.
5,The Proud Breed,"This is by far my favorite book. The characters are true to life. The author has painted a vivid portrait of the characters, places, and the historical information that makes them come to life for the reader. I have read every book written by this author and, while I have enjoyed all of them, this has remained my favorite and has remained in my memory for many years and I find myself going back to re-read this at least once a year. I would highly recommend this book."
5,"Wonderfully comfortable, every day sandal",This sandal is so very comfortable. It looks nice with anything but your dressiest clothes. It is a sandal to live in.
3,not as comfortable as other Clark sandals,"Like another reviewer, I love Clarks shoes. This style is very cute but not as comfortable as several others I have purchased - especially across top of my toes."
5,Suprised,"I have owned this product for about two weeks or so. The first few times I was out in traffic ,I really thought it was broken because it very rarely did anything !!!. I called whistler about it because I thought it was broken. The very infomative support person I talked to said It sounds like it is working ok. and that I would be suprised how many patrol cars do not use there radar.so I should try it for awhile first then If I am not happy send it to them. Well this AM I got into my car and turned it on in my driveway. it started going off!! I turned down the road the beeping went to a higher and higher # on the scale. about a mile down the road was a patrol car sitting in a school zone it then regged a 9 on the scale. So I am so pleased to say I love this product It does not seem to give alot of false alerts like other products on the market."
3,Not enough bang for your buck...,"I got this product thinking that it would be a great radar detector for $85, and it is. However, having occassionally used a Passport 8500, this radar detector is a major letdown. You can't choose an automatic mode--you must choose between City modes or a Highway mode. Additionally, the detection gives you very little warning...maybe 1000 feet at best for a cop using Ka on the highway (that will get you a ticket).So, if you don't fly, but like to go 5-10 MPH over the speed limit and feel the need for a detector, then this is the detector for you. But if you like to go faster than that, then this detector will not be of any use to you."
5,great little radar detector,"Purchased this radar detector several month ago and found it to be one of my best purchases.Works great and have saved many speeding tickets!So go ahead a purchase one, you will not be disappointed."
2,Short Range,"I purchased this for my husband for Christmas and asked him if he had a comment. This is what he said. ""The warning range is very close. I usually have less than a mile notice of activity."""
5,Great protection for your money!,"I've owned this item for approximately 6 months, and it's the best investment that I've made in a while! I've found it very reliable, and cost effective...especially since I now know when radar is directed my way...in time for me to do something about it, and not get stopped/ticketed!I highly reccommend this item. It is well-worth the purchase price."
2,You get what you pay for...,An okay detector. Didn't help me avoid getting a speeding ticket. The signal filtering is below acceptable but I guess that is what you get from a cheap radar detector. It beeps even when there are no cops around...have stopped using it now...
2,Worthless,This product does not pick up radar detectors until the patrol car is within 50 feet of it. Not sensitive enough. The only reason this I gave this products 2 stars instead of 1 is that it does go off but not with enough time to slow your speed.
2,smaller than a breadbox,"rather disappointed in product. it does work as claimed; however it is HUGE compared to the detectors in my other cars. One feature lacking: cannot shut off sound on only the ""detected"" radar--shuts off sound completely. also cannot read led indicators in bright light."
5,great racing game,This game is easy at first but some of the races are hard. The pods are great and the tracks are exciting. The graphics are great too. The game doesnt get boring very quickly and multiplayer is always fun.
3,This is a pretty good racing game,"Star Wars Episode 1 Racer. Well, in this game you play as one of many characters that can be unlocked by winning races and setting records. After each race, if you place high enough, you can upgrade your podracer by buying new parts, or searching through Watto's Junkyard. There is a multiplayer, but it is pretty standard, just a split screen racing option. This is a pretty good game, and ... it's a great buy. I commend Lucasartss for the feeling of really fast racing, but besides this and the ability to buy parts, this game is essentially nascar on different planets with space ships and a winner title."
4,Fast Paced Fun!,"this song is one of the fastest and most addictive games I've ever played. One problem...it does get old. But it's great with friends. If you want a time consuming game that will keep you on the edge of your seat, this is it. But be aware that too much IS always enough!"
3,Fun but gets boring,"I got this game for my birthday. It was really fun for about 2 weeks, but after a while it got really boring. The game is relativly easy to beat, but if your looking for fun right now this is a great game to get.Mario Golf, and Mario Tennis are great games though."
3,episode 1 racer,"This is a great racing game with the mild RPG elments of getting better parts for your pods. The tracks are unique and interesting, but can be extremly difficult at times. One of the main things that keeps this game going is that you can get many hidden characters. Some firmilar faces from episode 1 appear in this game. Too bad you can't use weapons though (Sebulba is the only exception, but they're kinda useles...) a battle mode would've rocked. They're are many controlls that will require your ""jedi reflexes."" The dreamcast version is better, so if it's an option to get the DC version, get it, but this is a great treat to N64 owners."
5,600 mph? Ha!,"I just got this game and I absolutely LOVE it! Its really fast paced and requires a lot of racing skills (a step up from MK64). Definitely buy this game. It has 3 different sets of 7 tracks, at three different difficulty levels. Plus another four super advanced tracks. There are also 24 diffent Pods to choose from. Buying parts from Watto is a real plus, and is fun to do. Oh, as far as going 600 mph, as it says on the back of the box, this speed is much too low. With one of the fastest Pod Racers I've reached speeds of 1300+ mph! No kidding! Of course, this was on a straitaway using a turbo boost, otherwise you usually average about 500-600 mph."
4,Hey Read This Before Buying,"This game is good. And is very diffrent from most racing games. It takes longer for it to get boring because of the diffrent worlds. I would give it 5 stars it is just, it does get boring. After you play it for about a week you never want to play it agian."
3,"bien, pero muy dificil","Starwars Episode 1 Racer is a good game with many challenging levels, however, they are a little too challenging. I found navigating my ship through this level was very hard. This game is a very good buy for (the price), though."
2,The track's get boring after the first level...,"One of the most exciting and visually dazzling scenes of the long anticipated Star Wars Episode 1 was the podrace. We were all on the edge of our seats as Anakin and Sebolba dodged obsticles and avoided the shots of Tusken Raiders. Who didn't want to be in Anakin's shoes at that moment?Nintendo had the chance to create an amazing game, with challenges of such magnitude that we could really feel as though we were flying in a pod.Unfortunately they didn't. You dodge obstacles and try to pass other people. And that's about it. No special features for the pods (with the exception of Sebolba's flame thrower), no interesting tracks, just dodging obstacles and trying to pass other people.Even I, a die hard Star Wars freak, couldn't find joy in the game. If you want a fun racing game get Hydrothunder, or Road Rash 64, even Mario Kart.What it comes down to is this: the tracks all seem the same after level 1....."
2,is this game really fun,"I bought podracer about a week ago and i'm already tired of the game. It was a really fun game for about two days, but ramming into walls and exploding every minute gets old. Once you get past the first section of races the next section is so hard that its more frustrating than fun. The only really good part of the game is you earn podracers and money to upgrade your podracers by winning the races, but in time you start losing all the races and stop earning money. The two player racing is okay, but i would rather race someone in a race car game than in a pod racer game because in podracer if you try to ram each others podracer you go right through them and damage your podracer."
4,Great game,"This Game was exiting and fun. Fast pace action that's addicting. There was a small draw back though. You only go head-to-head with one other player. I wish you could do more. I guess they thought that with that kind of speed, you needed most of the screen to play. Still a wonderful game."
2,BORING!,"This game was wonderful at the beginning, but it got boring after a week. I would not recommend getting it"
4,fast racing at its best,"Star Wars Episode I Racer is a pretty good racer. It's almost as fast as the Extreme G games and its graphics and sound is great for a racing game. In most racing games, it's hard to tell where you have to go in certain races the first time you play it, but not in this game. The bikes look like they came right out of the movie and the voices that come from your opponents when you're passing them and making them look slow are cool. Unlike many racing games, Episode I Racer is not a breeze. The enemies will keep up with you most of the race and if you even barely touch a wall they'll pass you. The selection of tracks is good and the track layouts are imaginative and some are inspired by the movie. The 2 player option is also a plus, but being able to play 4 at a time would be better.If you like speedy racers and you're a Star Wars fan, you should like Star Wars Episode I Racer."
4,this is cool,this game is fun pretty fun:pros:good graphicsfun game playfast or normalgear shifting 3 gearsconsbetter with rumble paksometimes you need to blow on it to get it workingoverall this is a awesome game for n64 . I bokught a used one cause they have saved files already.
3,chose wisely to get this,"first of all this is a star-wars game (duh) the audio is very good, the graphics are good even without the expansion pack and the developers actually knew what they were doing. the levels however are BEASTLY HARD the players don't speak an understandable language (other than anikan) and there is no story if these are things that bug you don't buy. if you want a good multiplier and challenging campaign then buy right away"
2,enough,easy to beat. if u like racing with your friends and making it multipul of them then its not for you
2,For Beginners,"Since I have been living in the desert for the past twenty-some years, I looked for a book to inspire me to paint seascapes again. I found the book to be very basic and not inspirational. To be inspired I must return to the seashore."
4,Valuable for learning to do fecal egg counts,"Excellent reference for learning how to do fecal egg counts. So far, that's all I've used it for, but it is worth it just for that."
5,Horse Owner,"Excellent well detailed book that I bought to help me with FEC on our horses. It's well set out, easy to follow and understand. Love the spiral binding too."
3,veterinary clinical parasitology seventh edition,"the book came some what handy, but I would have like more information than it gave. for example what drugs were used to treat the animals, or the difinative host and intermidiate host."
4,Probably better than Vampire the Masquerade,"I am a fan of Vampire the Masquerade and the GURPS books. The background info in this single book is far more interesting and the Vampires more versatile than in V:tM. If you haven't read it, I'd suggest you at least pick it up and give it a try. Highly valuable for GURPS GM's."
5,Best Vampire reference by far.,"Even though this was written for GURPS 3e it is still the best Vampire reference book a GM can have in his library. About every variant of the vampire described in myth, literature, and film than one can think of is represented here regardless of it being Dracula (Gothic), the being from Lifeforce (Alien), Boris Karloff's Wurdalak from Black Sabbath (Vyrolakos), Demonic (Succubus), or the ""traditional"" Europian vampire (Vampir).Of the 47 different ""species"" of vampires listed 30 are actually described in 23 listings (several are simply different names for the same type of vampire). Each description gives the origin and habits of the vampire as well as its strengths and weaknesses.Even if you don't play GURPS, Blood Types is still the best all around reference on Vampires."
4,A superb collection of music,"Like the movie, the soundtrack is simply amazing as many scenes were enhanced with music that couldn't have been more appropriate. Particularly touching was Sarah McLaughlin's ""When She Loved Me"" as it wonderfully captured the emotion behind the story. A powerful album that will be a welcome addition to any collection."
2,disappointed in the shipping method,"the books i purchased a few weeks ago did not yet arrive at their destination in san jose, costa rica. what takes so very long????????? i didn't mind paying the shipping price but i am wondering when the books will get there."
3,That's OK,"An OK book, but not as good as ""All that Remains"". I really like this kind of plot, but it could be better."
2,not so good tape,his basic and advance tape has nothing new information. showing only small part of shiatsu technics. it's not even good tape for laymen.
5,The best for children,This is my 2nd time buying this particular lock for my house. Previously my husband and I purchased two for our condo and loved them. They lock securely and our children aren't able to unlock them. We liked them soo much we are buying three more for our new house. They are the best locks we have found!!!
4,No intrusions yet,"This lock is pretty tough. It is secured by 3 long screws, which anchor it very firmly into the door frame. For the doors that don't have deadbolts, this is a great inexpensive option. I would certainly buy more if needed."
3,Allright,"Not the actual ""The Door Guardian,"" but a very similar product. This was as expensive as the name brand one, but it feels cheaply made, and I don't know how long it will last. The last time I purchased the actual ""The Door Guardian,"" it lasted 3 years of trouble free operation on my front door with daily use. Time will tell if this will last as long."
5,Great for safety - easy to install.,These work great and I know many people that use them up high on the doors to make sure kids don't open the doors as well. Easy to install and very strong once in place. A little pricey but well worth it.
1,Not easy to install,"Be careful! your door need 90 degree angle for this product to mount. Besides, the attached screw is in bad quality and easy to bend. The attached screw could not make a straight punch because it's too easy to bend(very soft)!!! I punch lots of extra failure holes becayse of the defect screw."
2,cheap chinese steel,"though can act as a reinforcement for a deadbolt,i am not impressed with the quality of steel, this is after all made in CHINA. one 3"" screw broke while installing by hand.and the plate that the screw goes in bends easily.if your going to sell a product as this,at least use quality steel. i think consumers would pay a little more knowing this product could hold up. too much garbage in the U.S. that use cheap labor and materials in the name of extra profits. keeping children indoors more likely."
5,FANTASTIC door security,"Very long screws (3 inch?) that drill well into the door frame/stud. Heavy duty steal construction and brilliant design. For safety sake (especially if you have kids), I recommend placing it a 18 inches or so from the ground. I placed it about this height and it only took me a few minutes to teach my 4 year to open it in the case of an emergency. But with my full weight (215 lb) against the door from the outside, it wouldn't budge. So with proper placement, kids can reach it from the inside in case of fire or something, but criminals smashing through the top window glass of a door can't reach it- probably wouldn't even notice it. So even if the bad guys reach around and unlock the deadbolt, it will be difficult for them to get through the door. The bad guys would have to REALLY want in to either bust through this lock, or crawl through shattered glass to get in. WELL worth the money."
4,"Nice child lock, but required a bit of work to install.","Very nice childproof lock. I got the brass color, which is an antiqued gold color, which goes well with our existing hardware. We had to notch out a portion of the door to install, which we did not expect. It's basically like a really high deadbolt."
4,Works very well!,"Bought this to keep my kids from opening the door and I LOVE it. Only downside is you can't open the door from the outside if it is locked on the inside and I locked myself out because of that. My oldest daughter can easily open it, but the younger two can't. Another plus is I didn't have to drill any new holes in the door which is nice since we are renting, I just removed the existing lock plate and put this one on instead. Would recommend, just remember to unlock it if you go out the garage and shut the garage door after you or you too will get locked out. =)"
2,magnet does not work!!!!!,i had this case before.. but for some lame reason this one does not stay magnatized to my fridge!!! thats extremly inconvinient!
2,Confusing,"This is my first time buying a Denise Austin video, and I had read other reviews, but I really just wanted to try it out for myself. I only did half of the warm-up and I was lost, she moves into her next step so fast, and doesn't tell you what to do next. So you're always a step behind. She is awful. When I have more time and patience I'll finish the video, but I wouldn't buy another one of her videos again. And here's a tip: buy from the ""new and used"". Save your money."
1,Rediculous!,This buy was a MISTAKE. The dancers are often off beat and Denise doesn't explain the moves before she does them. I would sell the DVD if I thought people would buy it.
2,NOT for Cardio workout....,"I have worked out to Denise Austin for several years because I think she gives a good workout BUT I CANNOT stand her way-too-perky personality. I was very disappointed in this dance workout. The setting is fun and colorful and the music is great, but as far as a workout...this dvd really stinks. I found some of the steps somewhat confusing (but I am NOT very coordinated). This workout was more of an ""indoor walk"" style workout (like Walk Away the Pounds w/ Leslie Sansone, etc.). If you are looking for a fun way to get up and move, this may be for you. BUT, this is not for anyone looking for a cardio intense workout."
3,Barely broke a sweat,"This DVD is quite simple, and, honestly, a little boring. The moves aren't challenging, nor all that fun, and I found myself staring at the clock waiting for the 20 minutes to get by. I like other Denise Austin tapes, but I don't recommend this one."
2,What a dissapointment,"I usually like Denise's workouts, but I am so dissapointed. If you are looking for a ""dance"" workout, this is NOT it. There were dance moves included in the cardio workout, but I believe you could really injure yourself by doing them. This was basically any of her other workouts with a few dance moves inserted here and there."
2,Na-a! Not good!,"This is like the worst exercise dvd I own. I bought it about 4 years ago at a Walmart. I couldn't use it then, still can't use it now even after so many years. 4 years is a long time and I just thought by now my views might have changed. Needless to say there is absolutely no change in my opinion about the dvd. Perhaps if you've got a dance background of some sort you might enjoy this."
4,Good workout!,"I like Denise Austin workouts. The fit is perfect for me, as she's easy to follow, encouraging, motivating and the workouts are a good variety. I have other Denise Austin DVDs as well and they're all challenging enough."
2,Not her gig,"Denise Austin is a great fitness instructor, however dance is not her ""thing"". I love to dance and it was very hard to watch her and try and dance to the true rhythm of the music in the background. Now and then in the video she loses the her step to the beat of the music. I will have to stick with Leslie Sansone's in home walking videos. She(Leslie)is very good and very consistent with all of her exercise videos that I have purchased.Thank you."
2,Cardio Dance for Dancers,I own several Denise Austin tapes and DVDs. I do not like this one. The routines in the cardio segment change too quickly and too often to keep up unless you happen to be an experienced dancer. By the time I have figured out what Denise is doing she has moved on to the next set of steps or the ones after that. I've played the DVD numerous times and I still cannot do the steps.
4,Great Workout,I was using this workout a few times a week with great results. Have since switched to other Denise Austin workouts.
4,"Good workout,but cueing not great for the aerobics","I love Denise Austin, and had not purchased any of her workouts in a long time. This is a great workout, but my only complaint is that the cueing for the aerobics portion is lousy. Even the women in the background are having a tough time following her at times. After you have stumbled through it a few times, it is not difficult, but I don't like to be left behind. It is frustrating. Hence the 4 stars."
4,A Fun Cardio Workout with Denise!,"The five minute warmup, twenty minute cardio dance, and five minute cooldown/stretch is a lot of fun to do. If you enjoy dancing (and you don't have to be great at it!) and will enjoy Denise's bubbly personality, then I highly recommend this DVD. And it's not one of those DVDs where you'll feel burned out with doing it either. I use to do Charlene Prickett exercise videos but I'd feel exhausted after only five minutes and unable to finish. With Denise, I feel my heart pumping but I also don't feel as if I cannot finish either.There is also a twenty minute toning component using weights. This part of the DVD I don't care for, only because I like some of Denise's other DVDs better for toning. So that is why I rate this DVD 4/5 stars. But if you're on a budget this DVD can be implemented every day because it has everything you'll need - cardio, toning, and stretch."
5,You almost forget you're working out!,"This workout is one of the most fun I have done in a LONG time. I started exercising regularly again about 3 weeks ago, after not exercising for 2 1/2 years. Being so out of shape, I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to do this new DVD. Although it is challenging, I did all sections of the workout the first time through without stopping! I love that you can make the cardio exercises as high or low-impact as you prefer. Also, as a former dancer, I loved the dance presentation of the workout. I definitely recommend this video to anyone who is looking for something so fun you almost forget you're working out!"
5,Blast Away Fat,I bought this product on the recommendations of other reviews that I read. What a great DVD. It has everything combined for a great aerobic workout and to have FUN. This is perfect. Plus I love Denise Austin. She has a great attitude and is a good role model for people like me who are overweight.
1,Not too impressed,"I bought this under the impression it was a DANCE workout video, hence the name...However I was disappointed in more ways than one. The music in the background was so low you can barely hear it..And you aren't so much dancing, than doing dance moves at a slower pace. This not a video I would recommend."
5,Great exercise video!,"I love this exercise video! I think it is one of the best exercise videos by Denise Austin.It took for me a while to learn steps, but... I love challenges! Very beautiful view in the back. You feel that you are part of the group that you see on a screen.I have at least a dozen of Denise Auston videos and I use all of them!"
2,To the back of my shelf,"Denise is too perky, too chirpy and she fails to give guidance with her moves. If you haven't been working out for very long, or if you have never had good instruction, it would be easy to injure yourself with all the flailing around Denise does. I'll stick with Kathy Smith or Karen Voight or Lisa Hart."
1,"i'm sorry, but....","...i have Denise Austin's ""Shrink Your Female Fat Zones"" DVD and I LOVE LOVE it, so I decided to pick this one up. I am SO sorry that I did. I work out with my friend and we could barely get through 10 minutes - the moves are ridiculous and, although it did get our heart rates up, it's mostly because we were laughing hysterically at the moves. Honestly, they just made us feel ridiculous. I recommend getting the other DVD."
2,Dance Club-NO and Cardio-NO,"If you are in good shape, work out regularly and were looking for a good cardiovascular workout on your days off, this is going to seem like child's play and a little silly. The dance step workout section is also short, rushed and confusing. No doubt, however, some will consider this a very fun workout and I admire Ms. Austin's enthusiastic teaching style, so I gave it two stars. Otherwise, it's a waste of $10.00."
4,Not for the obese,"I had been doing low impact aerobics for 2 months, I assumed I would have no problem working out for only 20 minutes, WRONG. I found myself sweating excessively just by doing the warm up. The cardio workout was exhausting, way too much jumping, bouncing and shaking for someone like me carrying an extra 50 lbs. I wouldn't recommend this DVD for beginners or those obese to severely obese, its all high impact no letting up, and forgot about the strengthening session, high impact, lots of squats.However, I plan to keep this DVD for the future when I'm down to my last 10 to 20 lbs to lose, less fat jiggling and stronger knees."
1,worst workout EVER!!,"over the past 20 years i have worked out to over 100 different videos. this is the worst one i have ever come across. the music is not loud enough, denise has HORRIBLE cuing, the workout is boring and the girls working out with her look plastic. please please do not buy this dvd. you can just dig mine out of the trash."
1,Burn Fat Fast-- but only if you insist,"I recently purchased Denise Austin's Burn Fat Fast Cardio Dance and Sculpt video. As with The Dance It Off video, I found the moves too complicated, too stressful upon my joints and too annoying to follow. In addition, the cameraman/woman seemed to have a peculiar fixation with the jiggly breasts of one of the dancers. Top if off with the fact that my body refused to cooperate with my mid-life brain and you won't be surprised that this video ended up in the same place as the Dance It Off video. The Landfill. Why? Because it didn't deserve the honor of being recycled."
2,Don't Bother Buying this,"To all those who are looking for a break from the mundane aerobics exercise....don't buy this...this is not a dance video. Denise tries to dance but it does not work. The only part that is enjoyable and makes much sense is the strength training exercises.If you want a good work out buy Denise Austin 'Bounce Back After Baby"" video. The exercises are pretty much the same as is offered in this DVD, however, they are much better choreographed and overall does a better job.If you don't remember anything else...do remember buy ""Bounce Back After Baby"" it is good for anyone, whether you have had a baby 10 years ago or never have...if you are have just delivered and want to start..you might want to wait a little longer to try this..then again that depends on you and how fast your body is ready."
3,Love/Hate,"I bought this video after I had used Denise's ""Blast Away 10 Pounds"" a while back. ""Blast Away..."" delivered on its promise, but I never used both 20-minute segments. The first segment was great and the second one was too easy and dancy.I'm having the same thing happen with this video.The Dance Cardio part sucks. It's way too easy and a little silly. The strength training part, however, is EXCELLENT. It's quick, it taught me new moves, and it really made me burn. I love working upper and lower body at the same time with weights. My only complaint is that I wish there were more reps for each workout. I'm finding myself continuing the reps while she's changing positions.My solution? I do the first segment of ""Blast Away 10 Pounds"" and switch DVD's and do the second Strength Training part on ""Burn Fat Fast.""I can get a pretty good cardio and strength workout in just under an hour."
1,Buyers remorse!!!,"This is the worst exercise DVD I have ever purchased. Denise is over the top sappy and gives poor instruction, moves are stupid and simplistic, music is boring and uninspiring. I felt like I gained absolutely no benefits from exercising to this DVD. I really like Denise's Blast Away 10 Pounds DVD it gives a quick and good workout. I thought this would be a good DVD for a different twist, boy was I wrong. Kathy Smith and Tami Lee Webb are a better bet, I won't buy another Denise tape unless I preview it first!"
5,Such a great workout,Easy and good workout. Great price for what you are given. Her steps are super easy to follow and when done right as instructed it is a great workout.
1,Burn fat fast,"It's ok. The tape is a common exercises. It's like a normal exercises, not great in a dance & sculpt. Better doesn't have any dancing at all."
2,"not as fun as the title sounds, but...","the dance moves are so dorky, even denise's backup ladies seem a little embarrassed. and some of the add-two-exercises-together parts of the sculpting portion seem like denise is inventing them on the spot, so you're just flailing randomly with weights. and denise's voice is about the most annoying thing ever... all that said, however, i do get a pretty seirously good workout from doing this whole program all at once, so i will still pull it out on days when i'm feeling fairly tolerant."
3,it was okay,"i love denise austin, but on this dvd she does not give you enough time to memorize the moves before she goes on to the next move."
4,lots of fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this is a fun workout, very easy to follow,denise came up with some good new moves in the 20 minute strength section.highly recommended"
4,the great pianist,The music of Oscar Peterson leaves me always a sentation of peace with which I would not never stop to listen to it. In this disc it is accompanied from splendid musicians. Thanks Oscar
3,The fastest Iolanthe in the world?,"This is a recording that shows its age a bit. The women's pronounciation is rather like the Queen's: from another era. It's not surprising I suppose, because this was recorded in 1960. John Reed is good as the Lord Chancellor, as is Kenneth Sandford as the Sentry. However, this production is so rushed! I strongly suspect this was recorded so as to end in time for the cast to get to the pub before last orders.Another possibility is that it was squeezed to fit a double LP."
2,Too much information,"This book contains an immense amount of information, however it is presented in such a way that it is not condusive to knowledge. I chose this book off a list expecting a psycological analysis of people who use the Internet. I was more than wrong. This book is 500 pages of survey data, with the numbers manipulated in such a way that they back up the authors' opinions. I came out feeling tricked and stuffed with numbers."

Are they causing havoc throughout the school? To find out simply read the book Squirrels in the School.
1,Unhappy with Amazon,"I would love to rate the product but since Amazon can't get their act together and ship the product I will have to wait.Got an e-mail on 25 June that the item had shipped, they didn't actually ship it until the 29th of June.The item shipped from Capital Heights, MD at the Amazon warehouse (60 miles from my house) but Amazon sent it to New Port News, Va (160 miles from my house) now I have to wait even longer to get the items I paid to have shipped. Called Amazon for assistance and they are sorry (Yeah right) but they don't offer to fix their mistakes ""Sorry we can't help but we apreciate your business and look forward to your next purchase"" Ha doubt I will buy from Amazon again."
1,HMMMMMMMM.................,"Well... first off let me say that I don't usually write review's. But, I had to on this product.. and not because it is great.... ITS HORRIBLE.. the reception is awful.... I hooked it up and tried every station possible... but to no avail. I had to turn the volume up extremely high... and the background noise is torture to the ears !! With all the crackling and static... I am very disappointed.... very !! I am just going to burn all my songs to disc's... or buy a plug and play receiver... I wish it didn't have to come to this ... darn it."
1,"Be carefull, your Ipod will DIE","I got this Transmitter because I had trust this brand (Griffin), but as soon as I connected it to my ipod and then to my car, my Ipod turn off and then die, the transmitter burned my Ipod and I am really pissed off, I found this product cheap and It had a good review buy users should be more carefull because It will kill your Ipod and surely you will not get any warranty, this transmitter in the end is a [...] buck transmitter.PLEASE DONT BUY!!"
1,Does not work as I intended,I bought this to go with my Ipod for my car only to find out that this product only works with its own products and is a final sale. Did not know any of that when I purchased it. What a waste of money.
5,Just what I was looking for.,"I first bought another fm transmitter that cost about $20 and plugged into the headphone jack. It was very fuzzy and almost impossible to obtain the frequencies. The Griffin iTrip Auto FM Transmitter works great for my c240 the sound is very clear it is very easy to get the frequency and will automatically turn the sansa on when plugged in.pros: Actually works with the sansa c240 which has very few accessories out for it, very clear, relativley long cable, easy to use.cons: there is no way to turn the transmitter of so you have to unplug it, otherwise the display stays on. (as far as i know)*and make sure have all the firmware"
4,NOT FOR IPOD!,"I bought this a few days back, then to get it and realize it wasn't for apple products, so read it twice people!!I'm sure it is great quality. I feels well made, was packed nicely and was delivered quickly, it just was my mistake that it wasn't compatible with apple! :("
1,Bad Reception,"From the directions for this thing you would like that using it in your car is such a sinch! WRONG! I live in a big city and since there are so many radio stations it has been impossible to find a static patch that will work. So, if you live in a big city don't pay the 50-70 bucks just to be dissapointed!"
1,I have an iPhone. I am stupid for buying this,"I accidentally bought this because I thought it said ""Compatible"" with iPhone/ipod but when I read it now it obviously says it's incompatible with those devices. While it's my fault I bought it why do they even mention that it's not compatible? I mean. My iPhone charging cable doesn't support Sony Walkman but there was no tag on the box that said ""Not compatible with Sony Walkman"" on it. I think they put that on there because they knew that people would see it more searching the term iPhone or iPod and the giant label on the box that says don't open it if you plan to return it and the iPhone warning on a huge label indicates that I'm not the only dolt to make this mistake.I am giving them 1 star because they are purposely trying to get hits on this product using keywords. Amazon, fix this listing."
2,Lacking in sound quality,"This unit is easy to set up and use, unfortunately the sound quality is pretty bad. First, I had to to turn the bass all the way down when using it because it was very loud and boomey, to the point where it was causing distortion on my speakers everytime the bass drum was hit. Also, there seems to be little to no stereo separation, even though my car stereo was picking up the station in stereo. I would not recommend this."
2,You get what you pay for.,"Not sure if I received a defective item since seller claimed item was new but what I received was obviously used (may explain the low purchase price). Item had great sound quality in my garage but once I started driving, there was very bad reception. Very noisy and static. No backlit display."
4,FM Transmitter,"First of all, I like the price. Similar items are sold for over 50 dollars.Second, it is very easy to use, the manual is very easy to understand and follow directions.It takes some time to figure our what is the best frequency to use to avoid noise, after lots of tries I picked 90.5 and enjoy it ever since."
2,Low price for low sound quality,"I purchsed this to use in my 07 Mustang GT with my Sansa Fuse. It's only okay some of the time. I have the radio tuned to 88.1 and there's a lot of static most of the time, so the sound quality sucks. It sounds like your listening to a radio station that you're about to loose the signal on (kinda like on a roadtrip). Another thing they told me that was wrong, is that you just plug in and use the volume level on your radio. NOT TRUE. The volume level and EQ settings on the Fuse affect the levels on your radio as well. It's hard to find a good medium because some songs will distort and other you can barely hear. This might be due to the MP3 dowload quality, but still very frustrating. To be honest, I have hardly used it in the last 2 months since I purchased it becasue it sounds so crappy. Like they always say, I guess you get what you pay for!!!"
4,Sounds ok - what you pay for,"At the beginning was having problems because everything sounds like distorted however figure that it was the internal equalizer my Sansa e280 have... I just put bass, tr, voice and evertyhing down like -something or the lower numbers and now it sounds better. Not a CD quality but its ok."
2,SonicJ,"Junk.....You can hear a fuzzy white noise sound ALL the time. No way to turn device ""ON"" when just charging, have to unplug it and plug it back in. Don't waste your money."
3,Griffin ITrip for Sansa e280,"This was obviously made for the Japanese market where you would have your cigarette lighter on the drivers' left. In the US, having the power source on your light, the display will be upside down, unless you do a loop with the wire to be able to see the frequency display right side up. It works as advertised, although in a busy metropolitan area where you have radio stations on every other FM frequencies, it is pretty much useless. You will hear your iPod of Sansa like a crappy distant FM station cutting in and out and all that with quite a bit of static. It should work well in more remote areas free of much radio clutter (it works great deep in a concrete parking garage where radio reception is almost null)."
5,"First One Stolen, bought it again","Hope the guy who stole it hooks it up to his Ipod and ruins it. Mine had a Huge sticker on the front that said NOT for Ipods only sandisk, Not sure how people miss all the warnings. This thing works great we have a lot of stations around and I can find open channels. It charges the mp3 while your listening. No complaints if your not an apple head get this."
3,Needs some changes but good for the price.,"Nice display. Better than the ones that are part of the lighter plug. Cord is too short. Like all the rest, no stereo transmission."
1,will not work,"I purchased one that never worked. I had it replaced and it still didn't work. I followed directions explicitly, and tried 3 different locations on the fm band that had no signal present. Not a sound. Didn't matter which volume control was turned up or if they were both up. Nothing. Therefore, I have no idea about performance."
1,DONT BUY FOR IPODS,"This item isn't meant for ipods! Beware... I purchased it because a friend has a similar one, and was just about to use it when I read that it fries the hard drive on ipods."
1,I received the wrong product with no return option!!!!!!!!!! This is bait and switch!,"I had the Griffin 9202 iTrip and it was smashed in my moving up the coast.. My old one looked like the one in the picture.. the one this seller sent me is only the transmitter, not the charging base that is advertised.. so instead of getting awesome sound, I get nothing, but what would be transmitted through the headphones. I am upset because there was no return option and I am not satisfied at all!!! The picture advertised is not what you will get! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PERSON!"
2,BEWARE IPOD OWNERS,"I have this exact same model for iPod and loved it. Best you can get for the money. It's 5 years old and falling apart so I asked for a new one for the Holidays. Husband accidentally bought this one for the Sansa because they look exactly alike. I plugged my iPod into it and it shorted it out and fried it. Apple was nice enough to replace it even after I admitted what I had done but others beware, this is NOT for an iPod and will probably ruin it."
5,Griffin iTrip FM Transmitter,Very easy to use but make sure you set up before you start driving!!!None of the preset channels worked for me so I set my own frequency to use just took a minute to set up.
5,Bought this after trying numerous cheaper devices.,This product has worked extremely well and only once or twice have I had any background noise in either a hire car and my own. I have used it with both my Sansa C250 and Sansa Connect with no problems whatsoever.
4,The product is acceptable for the price,This item works just fine. I found a station that works. It is necessary to find another station when you leave the area. For instance the station I found in Los Angeles County with the least static worked well until I drove into San Diego County. I had to find another station at some point.
3,eh...,"Okay, it works in theory, but IN NYC/NJ area too many people drive their cars with XM/SIRIUS radios, and they use the same frequency requirements. The sound isn't great. Just barely Ok."
2,halfway works,"The charger feature doesn't work, and if the player is on pause for more than a minute or two, it turns itself off. Not too good for long car trips."
2,This product is defective,"Never met the seller but the product is not to my SATIFACTION....I CAN'T SET THE STATIONS ON THE TRASMITTER, CAN'T SET THE MONO/STEREO FUNCTION AND when I turn off my car the transmitter will cut off completely so I will have to pull it out of the cigarette lighter and put it back it and reset the channel back on the device to hear my music through the SPEAKERS.....BUT THE PRODUCT IS USED SO I REALLY HAVE WASTE MY MONEY....WILL BE PURCHASING A NEW ONE VERY SOON!!!"
3,"OK, but you can tell its not a cd playback","It works as advertised, but I've had trouble finding a clear enough station. When it plays back you get static during the louder parts of the music. I've moved it around a little and gotten slightly better reception, but still an issue.Another issue, which I think is a Sandisk issue, is that when you plug in the player, the volume blasts in the headphones. Even if you have the player setting at reduced volume. This can't be good for the headphones, so I have to unplug the headphones when I use it.I had been hoping that the playback would be at least as good as a regular radio station and its much below that. Its also difficult to set the station on the device. I could only store the station when using the manual(which I hate to use).Its the only one I found for Sandisk so thats why it gets 3 stars, but I had really hoped for better performance."
2,Been through two of them in one year,"I purchased this unit a year ago because it was the only one on the market that had both the transmitter and the charger. For many weeks, it worked as well as I would expect it. There was a little static, but through some of the metropolitan areas I traveled through, it held up just fine. Then, after five months of using it about three weekends a month, it died. I had updated the player and everything, but when I connected them together, it didn't work. Plus, it caused the player to have power surges.I called Griffin to get a replacement. First, they sent me back then wrong model (they sent an iPod transmitter). Two weeks later, I got the right unit, and less than 48 hours later, that one died, too. This time the player is completely useless.I gave it two stars because it was great when it worked and having the option to get a new one within the warranty time was fine. However, it doesn't work for long."
3,Static...,"This product does what it says, but there are only one or two stations available for its transmission. There is a lot of interference static-wise. It is ok but lower quality."
2,"It works, but has weaknesses","It does indeed work. However, if you travel and the frequencies are in use by different stations, you find yourself fumbling for another frequency the device can transmit to.Annoying.When there isn't any interference like this, it is clear and works well.I've reverted back to my tape cassette adapter, which works perfectly all the time it is in use."
1,Couldn't get it to work,"I tried every single station and couldn't find one that would transmit my MP3 player. I got updates for my MP3 player and still did not work, so I returned the transmitter. The upshot of it all was that I got my refund with no problem from Amazon."
4,Product good but Amazon slowwwwww!,"This transmitter does a good job at what it's designed to do...play MP3's.I like the fact that all my CD's are now safe in the house not melting in the car or being stepped on. Overall this product works good however be warned that even though Amazon had it ""in stock"" they took over a week to ship it. I found that very disappointing for Amazon and will think twice next time before i buy from Amazon."
1,Thanks for frying my iphone 4...,"Bought this product after misreading the title. This product fried my iPhone's hard drive...I spent 8 dollars to fry my $200 phone. Thanks a lot Griffin. Instead of having iPhone incompatible in the title, put it in the description so it DOESN'T come up when I search iPhone FM Transmitter."
3,Convenient,I'm pleased with the convenience of being able to listen to my MP3 Player in my car this product gives me. It is also easy to use.
1,Poor quality,"I don't know if it was because the unit was a refurb, but it sucked. It sounded like there was a short in the wire so it had to be held a certain way when in use. When it did work, it had very poor transmission and there was always static playing through the music. Even though it was a refurb, it shouldn't have been sold if it didn't work."
2,Not particularly the best transmitter.,"I live in LA and it works inside the city alright, except the ocassional jitters and static noise. But when you hit inter-state, it often loses the transmission."
3,Works better than other modles but nothing to brag about.,I works but I need to unscrew my car's antenna to get max performance. Using in a 2007 Pontiac G6.
3,Works Well for the Price,First of all: THIS IS FOR THE SANSA NOT IPOD.It works as described. Power it up and turn the volume up all the way before plugging in to the transmitter for the best sound output.It's a nice way to get some new music in an old car!
4,nice item,"I like the idea of this item. There is some static that I can't get rid of. I still like it, though."
4,Sansa-specific FM transmitter; iPods rot,"This is apparently the only Sansa-specific FM transmitter. (Everything else seems to be made for iPods and all the drones who own them.) It works fine. The audio is great--very clear. It charges the unit while playing. It's a breeze to use, so easy even iPod owners could use it correctly without instruction. It is a bit unwieldy though. I don't know why the transmitter is in the middle of the line--it seems like it would have been a better design to have the transmitter attached to the DC jack.UPDATE: This thing broke for no reason in less than a year. If I could, I'd lower my rating to 2-stars."
4,Please enter a title for your review:please enter....,"At the first few listens, i liked several songs a lot but thought the rest were quite simple and bland. However, i've really come to appreciate the quality of each song, which, although instantly accesable, still stand the test of time. A truly fantastic album, brimming with melody and emotion.Songs like oh river, promise me and when we say are so jam packed with melodious goodness it's hard to stop listening to them."
3,Yeah dude,"The concert footage was cool, but would have been better with more content. I watched the whole thing in like less than an hour. And whats up with the moments suspended in time? Its the same videos they've been posting on youtube for like a year. I don't know, this dvd seems very thrown together. And it wasnt even released on 7-7-07\If you are a real underoath fan, you should probably get this. Casual listeners should not get this."
3,"THIS IS 4 GREG AND ALL WHO,THINK THE RCR STILL ROCK","YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING THIS CD IS THE LAST THING THEY HAVE PUT OUT THAT IS KINDA GOOD.THE FIRST 2 WERE GREAT AND WHY NOT DAN MCOOL WAS SINGING.THIS WAS THE START OF THE DOWNFALL.IF YOU DONT THINK IM TELLING THE TRUTH JUST CHECK OUT THE NEW CRAPPY GLAM CD.(I LIKED IT BETTER THE FIRST TIME WHEN THE N.Y DOLLS DID IT)AND THE DOLLS THEY AINT.YOUR COUSIN THINKS HIS BAND IS GREAT,THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IF MR.MCOOL WAS STILL SINGING HE HAD THE SMARTS TO LEAVE A SINKING SHIP.I REALLY WANT TO HEAR YOUR REVIEW ON THE NEW CD.AND TO ANY1 WHO READS THIS JUST STICK WITH THE FIRST TO CDS.OR BUY THE NEW CRAPPY 1 FOR 2 BUCKS ON HERE THATS ABOUT WHAT IS WORTH."
1,Rebel about what?,These guys are completely pathetic. They were standing in front of me at a U2 concert in Seattle and they were too cool to even act like they were enjoying the music at all until Bono got closer to us on the catwalk that went out into the audience. Then suddenly one of them came alive like a teeny-bopper at a Brittney Spears concert and rushed the gate to try and touch Bono's hand. It was truly a sad display for a band who claims to be so anti-establishment and punk. Just another crappy band with two many tattoos and no talent.
5,This book is going to be...,one of those few that I'll never throw away. I can't tell you how many times I'm likely to read this book because I have no insight into the time of my death. Bravo!
2,Melodramatic,"McCarthy is a very talented writer (read Blood Meridian and All the Pretty Horses) but he is also known for a very melodramatic style of writing, using many archaic words. Suttree is written is this style and one could say it is 471 pages of melodrama without a plot. Despite the novel's length it is very underdeveloped and the reader is not sure why he should even care about the main character. Certain chapters are interesting (the workhouse chapter especially), but these passages are few and far between. Also the violence at times is ridiculous and does nothing to advance his ever prevalent theory that the world has always been this way and will continue in this way. McCarthy writes about nature beautifully, but after finishing this book, one is left unfulfilled."
3,book,"To the layman reader, the book was overly comprehensive. McCarthy writes so much off the wall imagery its hard to naturally/instinctly imagine wtf he's talking about. The story it self is very slow."
1,suttree,"Incomprehensible..Boring, A waste of money..I you want to spend time trying to unravel what the heck this man is trying to say, then do so..I gave it my best shot and in disgust tossed it into the waste basket."
1,Suttree by Cormac Mccarthy,"The book came in excellent condition from the used book store and I hope the book store will be willing to take it back since I do not want to keep this book in my library and I am willing to just give it away. I thought it was the worst book I have read in years. I kept on thinking as I was reading it that it would get better, but it didn't and I wasted my time reading it. I belong to several book clubs and read several books a month. This was a book club selection. I am sorry I had to read it and I will not recommend this book to any of my friends."
2,A beautifully written book about revolting people,"5 stars for an outstanding book, but just one star for being a pleasant read. The characters were convincing but totally unlikeable -- self-indulgent, self-destructive, sordid, and degenerate.The setting -- 1950s Knoxville -- was also very well-done, but again unappealing.I read about halfway through this book mainly to get a feel for my hometown in the 50s. Finally I gave up -- I just didn't want to be around any of the characters any more.If you like this sort of thing, you'll love this book -- it is very well-written. It's just not my taste."
2,Long murky road to ?,"I'm a Cormac McCarthy fan. I have read most of his books and recommend them all to friends and family. While this book was disappointing, CM is a master of language - you feel the cold, the hunger, the addictions and the poverty in this novel. The imagery brings you to live the scenes. However, this story has no plot - it meanders and wanders. While the Suttree character is developed nicely - you never understand why he's walked out on his family or why he comes and goes as he does. CM uses heavy doses of ""dictionary look-up"" words. The novel is dense and thick with descriptions of the surroundings and environment - as a result the book is long (very), unsatisfying and unfulfilling. If you are new to Cormac McCarthy's work - try any one of his other works including The Road, The Border Trilogy, No Country for Old Men or Blood Meridian."
3,Long ...,"Thinking about reading CM? Here's some advice: skip Suttree, try Blood Meridian. Suttree is overly long and, in the end, generally unsatisfying. It would have made an excellent short story, though."
1,way too wordy got in way of story,This novel was heavy with description and exaggeration. l tried to skip it to get to the meat of the story which is what every writer's role is from the Bronte's to Danielle Steel. l do not think l will read his other novels.
3,get ye some plot structure,"I love C. McCarthy, but I was a little disappointed with this book. I've read the first two volumes of The Border Trilogy, and I feel that McCarthy's capacity for transcendent mythic prose is better suited to the stark landscape of Mexico and Texas, rather than this grimy Southern river life. In the border novels his lack of narrative structure works well as a picture of existential drift. His heroes need to be on the road someplace, rather than stranded in a town. I wanted Harrogate to be the hero, and I wanted him to steal a car and drive to Mexico."
5,Great!,This is an amazing book. I finished it in 4 days and started all over again. Not for children though.
2,If I read one more line about the filthy river...,"While I take into account that I read this book for my Fiction Writing class and not for my own pleasure, it was difficult to slog through. I found the titular character to be wholly unlikable, wandering aimlessly up and down the riverbank. His interactions with other characters range from bland to uninspiring, and left this reader wondering what on earth the author hoped for us to learn.My particular pet peeve with this novel, however, was the grindingly repetitive description of the central river. I really did not need to hear how it was a filthy yellow watered stretch, littered with condoms. Over. And over. And over.Two stars instead of one because I concede that the prose itself was not absolutely horrible. It was readable, just not enjoyable in the least."
4,Just A Matter Of Time,"It's just a matter of time before this new artist will get popular and really make it big. She is unique and so is her style. It didn't take me long to feel her vibes, I felt it the very first time I listened to her cd. I love ""Gi Me Your Loving"". Be strong and keep the faith, you'll make it one day.Janel Lewis"
5,Very Good Album,"This is a very good cd, I'll recommend it to anyone. I enjoy listening to the sound of Wadadli Queen. her style is very natural and unique. Her songs are kicking down here in California. Also in London England, France and Italy. I can't wait to hear what she will be coming out with next."
4,Letters to Julia,This is an excellant book. I loved Julia Child and how she cooked with such passion. Reading this book makes me feel like I really know the person.
3,"Good, but boring sometimes...","This book is very interesting, but at times it gets boring. But, if you like books that don't have long chapters and that you can read fast, this is the book for you. When I read it it was kind of boring at some parts because they talk about the same stuff all the time. I like the chapters in the books the best because they are interesting!"
4,like it,"I love the concert, but I didn't realize that some of the extra things I had seen on youtube, were included in this dvd, but it was still worth the money to me."
2,Synchoronised play back,"I went to see the 3D movie and I enjoyed myself. But I was disappointed to this DVD. This DVD is same as the movie and there is no extra bonus songs or whatsoever, which I don't mind. Also all images are transformed into 2D not 3D, which I did not mind either. What I did mind in this DVD is that during concert, song and images are not recorded same time. It's like synchronised play back. If you see the ""I'm a Slave 4 U"" by Brittney, you can easily see that the her mouth movement and her singing voice does not correspond very well. I was disappointed at this DVD at this point."
3,Glee: The Concert Movie,"This movie was purchased for a gift and the person I purchased it for said that it was ""ok"". This movie wasn't exactly what she had hoped for,because of all the hype that was built up surrounding this movie; she didn't feel like it lived up to all the hype and advertisments. But it was ""ok"" to watch.Amazon: Thanks for the great customer service that you provide. My package arrived to me in mint condition!"
5,Glee concert 3D,This is a must have DVD for Glee fans. The audio and video is excellent quality and the arrangements and renditions are five star. The sale price was the lowest on the internet and it arrived in three days.
5,Glee the Concert Movie,"If you like Glee, you will enjoy this. This movie also has inserts from actual fans and how glee has helped them."
2,Disappointing,"My daughter is an avid Glee watcher, and she was disappointed by this movie. She felt that it lacked a lot of the spark and really didn't contribute to the show in any way."
3,It's great,It's a great movie but on the dvd the Single Ladies is not on it at all. So I am a little disapointed.
3,not duplicate,This is not a review. I cancelled my first order of Concert Glee because I used the wrong credit card. So I ordered it again and the only option you gave me was to make a duplicate order. It is NOT a duplicate and don't send me two. Bad software component.
3,This was a concert?,"While I was thrilled to see this in theaters last summer (because I could not afford to go to the nearest stop on the tour), I was really looking forward to this DVD. I thought surely one of the special features would be the ability to watch the concert without all of the fan or gleek stories interspersed throughout. No such luck. While I was happy with the performances I was really looking forward to being able to see the whole concert."
3,Not all about the concert,"Having seen the concert live, I thought this would be a great thing to have as well. Turns out it's not what I expected. Nearly half the movie is spent on like three fans and not enough on the concert. If your thinking this would give you an idea as to what you missed, its not the case. As a gleek, its good to just throw into my collection."
3,glee concert,bought as a gift for my wife she is ok with it. i guess? wasted my dough because now it is all over hbo
4,Great for Glee Fans,"If you are a fan of Glee and could not go to one of their tour stops...You will love this..We all enjoyed it (""we"" as in my stepsons and myself)The only drawback was NO Mr. Schu... Coach Bieste... nor Emma...and not much of Sue... The little bit of her we did see was in the special features...Other than that.. It was a great ""concert in your living room!"""
3,Great for Glee Fans,"I am a huge Glee fan and love watching it although I am always a season behind.The concert very, well Glee. I don't know that someone who isn't a Glee fan could get into this. My husband is not into Glee and he walked up once and said, what is this garbage? Except when Britney was doing her I'm A Slave For You. Figures! While I don't agree with him. I wish there was more to it but did love watching.I felt like some of the characters weren't used enough. There wasn't enough Lea Michelle and definitely not enough Chris Colfer but was so excited that they included the Mash Up of Happy Days Are Here Again and Get Happy, one of my personal favorites.My favorite part of the concert were when the Warbler were on stage. They are just so good. I wish there was more of the characters backstage too especially since they were playing their characters and not the actors. My daughter is a bonafide Gleek although she has never seen the show, she loves the songs."
4,Mirage - 'Tomorrow Never Knows: Singles & Lost Sessions 1966-1968' (RPM Records) 4 1/2 stars,"Nice, fun to-listen-to and very cool twenty-three track collection of The Mirage - a lesser known British Invasion band. Tunes here I couldn't get enough of were their stunning Beatles cover ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" (one of my personal songs by the Fab Four), ""You Can't Be Serious"", ""I Want Love"", the catchy ""That I Know"", the sappy ballad (so to speak) ""Lonely Highway"", the nifty-sounding ""Hello Enid"", ""What Do I Care"" (could so easily be mistaken for an unreleased long-lost Beatles song) and the alternative edit of ""Lazy Man"" - to which I'm sure I've heard this song before - perhaps on a various artists title. Worth many, many.... repeated spins. Also appreciated the acoustic demo for ""Ebaneezer Beaver"" where the band had most likely borrowed the melody off the 'Sgt Pepper' lp and the upbeat 1965 acoustic edit for ""Go Away"" which was penned by the Hollies with Graham Nash on the vocals. Highly recommended."
5,I love it!,"This book is full of amazing recipes, some of them very simple to make, I've tried most of them and found them delicious, it's one of the books I use the most in my kitchen."
5,Love! Love! Love these sandals!,"I adore these sandals! Ran true to size and width and look great with capris, jeans, skirts, and bermudas. I haven't met a Circa Joan & David shoe I haven't loved yet!"
4,I like it!,"I thought this sandal was cute online and it was such an UNBELIEVABLE price I just had to have it. I have several JOAN/DAVID shoes and find the quality and style of this shoe to be really nice, but the very front appears to be cut a little different and so it gives the shoe a much larger look than I am use to. I like it and received a lot of compliments on it. I like the fact that I can dress it up or down, and I really like the wedge. I LIKE IT!"
4,Good Intro Text,"If you're a casual reader looking for bold explorations of the mysteries of consciousness, etc., then you should probably look elsewhere.This, however, is a very useful and clear text concerning the mind as information processor view (also known as the computational/representational theory of mind) that tends to dominate academic discussion. A good introduction to the 'cognitivist' paradigm and the philosophical issues that arise within it.The book avoids/evades most metaphysical issues, but achieves what it sets out to do very well."
2,somewhat dry,The author takes a combination platter approachto the material giving a somewhat bland result.The subject matter is rather familiar and the bestthing about the book is the suggested readingswhich follow each chapter.
2,art book,"I was very disappointed with this book. As a former preschool teacher, none of the projects in the book were new to me. I was hoping for some special projects to do w/ my autistic son, but we have already done them all."
4,Exactly the right item,"It's the right purchase for me,replaced older damaged skillet,deceided to upgrade a little, and it worked out perfectly. Will purchase additional Kitchenaid units as time and money permit.I recommend it!!"
4,A Good Christmas Movie!,"Jingle All the Way brings to the screen the story of a father as he rushes to find his son a Turbo Man action figure on Christmas Eve. Things get a bit complicated though, when Turbo Man action toys are the year's most wanted toys...Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rita Wilson, Jake Lloyd, Phil Hartman, Sinbad, and the rest of the cast, have carried out their performances wonderfully. Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs during the holiday season.The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all good.In conclusion, Jingle All the Way is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection if you are a Schwarzenegger fan."
5,Jingle all the way,I'm replacing VHS tapes that our family truly enjoy watching during the holiday seasons. And this was always one of their favorites. Truly a great movie.
4,Good Christmas movie,Great holiday fun movie. Makes you sit back and reflect on the little things that matter (like family). We all need to spend more time with the ones we love.
4,Great Movie,"My 6 year son Grant loves this movie, he is a big Arnold Schwarzenegger fan. It is one of his holiday favorites. The only thing is now ""Turbo Man"" figures are really expensive and hard to find this many years after movie premiered."
4,Replacing vhs version,I have this movie in vhs and have been replacing my Christmas movies to dvds. Jingle All The Way is a cute seasonal movie.
5,A Family Favorite,"It's tough to decide who steals the show more, Phil Hartman or Sinbad. Arnold holds his own, though, to make this one of our family's favorite holiday movies since when the boys were teenagers to now when they're twentysomethings. Mostly sillyness, it's just fun to watch as Arnold and Sinbad grow more desperate and maniacal in their search for that year's must-have Christmas toy, with a fun performance by Robert Conrad as the unlucky police officer who keeps turning up throughout Arnold's quest. To me, Arnold does a good job of acknowledging his action-hero persona and having fun in the movie. Now that we have the Blu-Ray, I'm glad we'll put this back into the holiday rotation."
4,Jake Lloyd is the MAN!,"I didn't really care about anything in this movie exept Jake Lloyd. The actual movie was...ok, but Jake Lloyd RULES! I love Jake no matter what movie he's in. End of story."
4,Good Movie,I saw this movie a little while ago. It was an ok movie. But I don't think it was at all horrible. Jake Lloyd was great and so was Arnold. I am a big fan of Jake Lloyd and I think he is a great actor whatever he is in.
5,A holiday favorite,"We like the post man and all the different emotions throughout the movie. It has serious, funny and action throughout."
2,Arnold has lost his swag,This movie is not as good as the more recent Christmas movies. The storyline is good but it's not one I would watch more than one time. Not a family favorite.
4,Holiday hooliganism!,"Sindbad and the Terminator play off each other like Laurel and Hardy, only more hip... and the set-ups?... are truly funny, not just the usual awkward embarrassments. It was slapstick enough to resurrect my old ""Stooges"" funny-bones, and slick enough to poke much needed fun at all the ethnic bias that gets so tiresome in our society. I like it!"
2,Below average family comedy.,The young son is so dang irratating that all you'll want him to get is a lump of coal. Arnold is o.k. but he's done much better. Some funny scenes that save it from a complete waste of time.
3,For little kids.,Ok for kids 10 years old or less. Not much entertainment value for adults. Both Arnold and Sinbads acting is beyond awfull in this Movie. The one redeeming quality is Phil Hartmans performance as the creep next door.
3,Glimpses of funny - stresses me out,"First, I don't have kids yet. Second, I've never had a job that required I work as much as Arnold Schwarzeneggar's job in this movie.Ok, now this a Christmas movie about the fight to get the right toy at the last second and the struggle to show your family that you care, because of the mistakes that you have made in choosing work over family. Sinbad is really funny at times in this movie, as is Phil Hartman. It's worth a viewing if you love Christmas and want to see a movie from the 90s. This movie just stresses me out at times, more than gives me warm feelings of Christmas. :)"
3,A Schwarzenegger Christmas,"I don't think Jingle All The Way should be called a classic, nor should it be called a dud. I think it's a very adequate Christmas movie. I hate parts of it, and I like parts of it. What I hate about it is Jake Lloyd and Sinbad. Lloyd is a terrible actor, and he proves it here (and further in Star Wars: The Phantom Menace). Sinbad is just acting as his usual self; his performance here isn't really that special. What I did like about this movie, however, is Schwarzenegger, Hartman, and Wilson: all three of them give good performances. It's especially really fun to see Schwarzenegger in a comedy (and that includes Twins and Kindergarten Cop). Sure, he may not be the best actor on Earth, but he can entertain just about everyone if the occasion calls for either action or comedy. Here, you can tell that he's had some fun during filming. Overall, this is just an OK movie, but you would definitely have to see it for Auh-nold doing some very good comedic work.Grade: C"
4,Another Christmas Favorite!!!,"Every time around Christmas, my mom makes us watch this. It has a really good storyline about a dad named Howard who forgets to get his son a Turbo Man doll. He has all sorts of misadventures on Christmas Eve trying to find one. He runs into another dad looking for the doll also. Will they find the dolls for their sons? If you love Christmas, you'll love JINGLE ALL THE WAY!!!"
4,arnold saves christmas,Classis Arnold comedy with the addition of sinbad to boot. Tons of laughs for anyone who loves this acting master. Got to get the turboman!
3,Jingle All The Way,This is just an ok Christmas movie. There are other holiday movies that I enjoy more. But this is just ok.
3,Good Family Show,"It had some really funny moments, the actors were great. It was kind of slow in spots but all in all a good movie to watch with the family."
5,Jingle all the way - laughter all the way,"Very amusing Christmas movie, this is the third copy I have bought as it gets taken home by family and never returned as the nieces and nephews get attached. Arnold is brilliant as Turboman. Great family night movie."
4,Good Christmas Film,This is a silly Christmas film but I think it's worth the view. I love watching Christmas movies during the Christmas season and was happy to add this to my collection!
3,Classic Holiday Fun,"If you are a fan of Phil Hartman, you can't help but indulge in this family-fun holiday movie. Despite the fact that Arnold headlines in this move, there are still plenty of fun, and funny, family appropriate moments. This has been added to my family classics collection for some time. Is it a great Hollywood, Oscar-Worthy Showcase?? NO!! But it IS good, old fashioned, CLEAN, holiday family fun. Product of the '90's?? This is one you shouldn't pass up. Full of 90's flair, clean family fun, and cheesy, feel-good Christmas crap, it's a movie you should put directly next to""A Christmas Story"". Red Rider BB Gun, and Turbo Man Action figure reminds us all of that ONE toy we just HAD TO HAVE!!!!!..... . ""Jingle All The Way"" is the 90's version of ""A Christmas Story"". And in that, a classic reminder of every child's ""Gotta Have"" dream!!"
5,Jingle,"I love this movie even though it's been on TV i still wanted to own it, it's very funny especially with Arnold in it. Definitely worth buying."
3,ITS TURBO TIME,Any one who is a parent and has desperately tried to get that one special toy for christmas will appreciate this film. The Schwarzenator plays a man who misses lots of things with his family as his workaholic lifestyle keeps him away. As his misses his sons latest Karate advancement he tries to Make it up to him by getting the toy he most wants for Christmas. Ofcourse its now ChristMas eve and Despite his wifes instructions to pick one up weeks earlier he must fight tooth and nail now to get this precious piece of plastic that just Happens to be the hottest item at Christmas. He Come up against a mad postal guy wanting the same thing. So begins the fun and misadventure. A very cute movie. Could have been better but still very cute with some good laughs and Christmas spirit. Lesson learned DONT WAIT TILL THE LAST MINUTE
2,Poor all the way,"Poor acting, lame humour. Everything you need for a complete money and time waster. After seeing this film, I felt I had lost something - it was not worth the time I spent watching it.Very young audiences might get some kicks out of this film - however, they will get exposed to the morally questionable events in it. The (low) humour is akin to that found in the Home Alone movies."
2,Fun but not a classic,"This is a fun but uneven holiday flick. I guess Arnold holds his own, but the pre-packaged script leaves little room for anything but going through the motions. Sinbad comes off awfully whiny and obnoxious. As a vehicle to contemplate the over-commercialization of Christmas, it might be a conversation starter, but do you want to waste 90 minutes of your life again? The true meaning of Christmas? Perhaps Jamie will look to real people in his life rather than fantasy figures -- not a bad message in the end."
2,spoiled little boy,all this movie is about is this boy wants an action figure and the dad drives all over kingdom come just to got this stupid action figure. as if they can not just say we are getting you something else. he ends up in the parade just to give his son what he want because he gets to give it to any kid. really what parent will waist there weekend or day just to get there kid what they want even though every where you go out of order. he ends up stealing from his neighbor's son to give to his son. at a certain point i think it you got to call it quits. no matter it they want it or not. this movie is still funny but come on now honestly. the whole way through the movie he is just trying to get an action figure and that is about the story.
3,I was an extra in this movie,"Unfortunately my scenes were cut or you couldn't see me due to a tight shot. The movie was filmed in April when it was warm weather. You'll notice no smoke is coming out of people's mouth during the outdoor scenes. I think this was before they could Computer Graphic it in. I thought the movie was ok if you have nothing better to watch. It is better than ""Junior"". lol"
2,Arnolds Worst,I saw this movie around Christmas Time and I was not very happy it wasnt that funny or touching at all I recomend to buy another Christmas movie
3,Somehow I think Arnold does a better job in action movies...,"Arnold Schwarzenegger is a talented actor in deed, but his performances in The Terminator, Predator, The Running Man, and Total Recall prove that his real talent goes for action movies. Sure he can be funny at times, and he really wanted to do comedian work. But...I think he is much better at what he currently does as an actor: Be the BAD GUY."
5,AWESOME !,I PURCHASED THIS MOVIE FOR MY 16MONTH OLD WHO LOVES BARNEY VIDEOS THINKING MAYBE HE WOULD WATCH IT DURING THE HOLIDAYS - I FINALLY HAD TO PUT IT AWAY IN MARCH SO WE DID NOT GET SICK OF IT. IT IS ONLY OCTOBER & HE IS TWO & STILL LOVES IT & HAS ALREADY WATCHED IT DAILY ..... MY 28 YEAR OLD BROTHER & MY HUSBAND ALSO LOVE THIS MOVIE ... IT IS ACTION PACKED & HAS GREAT MUSIC
3,"CUTE, LIGHT-HEARTED FARE","Arnie's constant mugging for the camera aside (straight out of the Buckwheat School of Double Takes), JATW is a cute holiday movie for the entire family. Pop it in when you get tired of both Home Alones."
3,Not all that Great,"Semi-Interisting plot, but gets tedious and repetitive at the end. Fairy-tale ending that would appeal to a MUCH younger crowd. Too much violence to be considered a kiddie or family movie. Still, it was sort of funny. I thought Arnold did a great job, and so did the rest of the actors, except for Jake Lloyd. I saw 'Star Wars', and it's a mystery why even a few people actually LIKE Lloyd. Maybe his acting will mature, but for know I think he should focus on school and MAYBE return to acting later. Like I said MAYBE. Or MAYBE not."
5,Great,It was shipped soon. New. I am satisfied but I do not have fifteen more words to say about it.
4,So Funny,This is a great family friendly Christmas comedy to watch with the family. We really enjoyed it and recommended to everyone.
3,"Fun for young kids, not really for adults","This is an excellent movie to watch with your young kids. My 11-year-old still thought the gags were hysterical, and it's very family friendly.Adults, on the other hand, will most likely find this to be an excellent sleep aid. The humor is silly and zany, not really intended for adults (I hope!) I enjoyed it because my son enjoyed it."
4,I Never Get Tired of This Movie,"I quote this movie all the time throughout the year, so I enjoy when Christmas rolls around and I can actually watch it ""in season"".Don't expect too much and you'll be pleased. Sinbad is hilarious and Arnold has some great quotes that sound ridiculous with his Austrian accent (""Put that cookie DOWN!""). More Sinbad would've been good and it does start to tire a little after you've seen it a few times. But if you've never seen it, you gotta watch it! One day I'm going to convince my family to put this movie on an endless loop on Christmas Day instead of A Christmas Story."
5,Cool movie!,This is a must see every Christmas! Enjoyment for the entire family and adds a little bit extra to the black Friday shopping periods.
1,WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!,"Ahrnold is the worst actor of ALL TIME. This is one case of a movie in which I hope no one else see's. I saw this in my reading class when Ms. P didn't have a lesson and showed this just to kill time, I was so board. I hope no one ever spends money on this movie. I'm so happy the period was only about 40 minutes long because I couldn't stand to sit during another minute of that movie. JINGLE ALL THE WAY, NEVER WATCH THIS MOVIE! Sinbad tries to be funny but is very, very, boring. Once again, don't buy this, and if you have to get this movie for someone, save them and save your money."
3,Nice movie for kids,"This movie is not meant to be more than the piece of fluff that it is. No need to go off the deep end here. We know it's not Hamlet! Could it be funnier? Yes. Arnold Schwarzenegger's accent does not help the comedy much. I wish he'd take some speech lessons. He's not very good at comedy nor is he a the most wonderful actor in the world. But kids don't care. I'm not going to suggest that you run out and buy this film right away but if you're looking for something for the kids to watch and they have everything else then by all means, give it a try.There are a few moments that are funnier than others, no thanks to Schwarzenegger. There is a message in the film which I can give you in a nutshell. Spend more time with your kids. Here ended the lesson!Parental advisory: There is some violence but no nudity, sex or foul language. I suggest a viewing age of at least 6."
1,Horrible Movie,"Even when I was younger when it first came out, I never liked this movie. It was not funny and the entire mood of the movie was mean-spirited. I could not find any character in this movie that I liked and it never put me into the Christmas spirit. The acting was not very well done and it did not display the true meaning of Christmas in my opinion. Spend your precious Christmas money on something better."
1,"WORST MOVIE EVER (next to ""Suburban Commando"")","Oh my God, this film was really bad. I'm sorry, Arnold just can't play comedic roles. The ending is especially horrible, because Arnold is trying to hide his true identity from his son by dressing up as a superhero. The retard was wearing a see-through mask with his costume. Like an 8 year old kid can't distinguish his dad from Blasto-Man. And it's not like Arnold has an Austrian accent or anything. It is your sworn duty as a human being to avoid this movie at all costs."
1,HORRID!,"UGH UGH UGH!!!! if i could, i woudn't give this ANY stars!!THIS IS JUST A LAME EXCUSE FOR A SIT-COM RERUN!!!!! i've never seen a Christmas ""movie(?)"" as bad as this. WHAT KIND OF A PLOT LINE IS IT ANYWAYS???!!!! its totally embarrassing to watch! i can't believe this went beyond a T.V. special! it's just plain aweful! OK, HERE'S THE PLOT: a bumbling father is trying to get his SON a doll for Christmas! There ya have it--the worst Christmas . . .(dare I say film?) flick ever made."
2,I mahst have zat Tyurbo-mahn dahl.,"Is Phil Hartman hitting on your mom?Is your Austrian Mr. Universe dad incapapleof defeating a 2-bit comedian/postal worker?Take heart, JINGLE is here."
1,"Not for kids, not for adults.","This is the kind of movie that is so bad in all regards that the only possible audience that could appreciate it would be under the age of six (and probably in special ed). However, it was full of swearing and sexual innuendo so I wouldn't recommend it for kids."
5,A favorite Christmas movie!,Its a must see every year! We know almost all of the words but it is still funny year after year.
4,Great Family Movie!,This movie is funny and it was agreat family movie. It showed what is truly important which is spending time with your family.
3,Enjoyable comedy film.,"Schwarzenegger may not be at his best in this film, but his effort still makes this a very enjoyable film to watch, especially at Christmas. He plays as a father of a boy who wants a famous action toy for Christmas. Its Christmas Eve and Arnold has to work fast to find his son this action toy before its to late. Its funny watching him fight through shops and crowds to get the toy, but Phil Hartman is such a poor actor. Overall, I think this film is good and is worth renting."
4,A yearly requirement,This movie is a yearly requirment for my daughter and I at Christmas time. We watch it while putting up decrations.
5,Arnold is great in it.,"I couldn't have laughed more. Arnold was so funny and he made such a sexy Turbo man, the whole movie was terrific."
3,Goofy but good,"It was a bit rough and not very Christmas-like...some adult themes for an otherwise child oriented movie. Still, it had its moments of humor. Quite predictable throughout."
5,LOVE THIS MOVIE,Thanks. My family loves this movie. It made our holiday so much better getting to see this. Thanks for making our Holiday..
4,Good film,I personally liked this film and thought it was funny and charming.Schwarzenegger is actually quite funny as the father who is desperately trying to find the hottest christmas toy on the market on christmas eve for his son(Jake Lloyd).And sinbad is hystericall as a bizarre mailman also on a hunt to find this toy for his kid.Although the story is kind of thin this film is quite entertaining mainly due to Schwarzenegger's performance.
3,Not a Bad Christmas movie...,"Someone called this movie and its characters mean. I can only assume that this person has nver been out on a holiday rush to get the season's hottest toys...Tickle Me Elmo? Furbys? Beanie Babies? Well hey, sometimes it does get brutal out there as parents fight to get that toy.Jingle All the Way may exaggerate it a little bit, but not by much as Arnold and Sinbad battle through the streets of Minneapolis to find the Turbo Man action figure. I've seen, on many occasions, parents racing through the stores to get to the store aisles just as the store opens, just like in this movie.Mean? No..perhaps a bit misguided but both men just want to make sure thier kids have a great Christmas. Phil Hartman is hilarious as the slimy, anal neighbor, cozying up to Arnolds wife and Robert Conrad is a treat to see as a cop who is always in the wrong place at the wrong time.Look for Jim Belushi in a cameo as a dept. store Santa. Not a classic, but good escapist holiday fun."
5,"As usual CRITICS WRONG, FANS RIGHT","Another case that a bloated, single dimensional, over-educated, over-analytical ""professional"" reviewer totally missed the point of this film.This is a funny and action packed film. Arnold again does a great job of making this a fun film to watch.See it..."
5,Brilliant book!,This book was absolutely brilliant - I thoroughly enjoyed it and still remember how great it was even though I read it months ago and have read tons of books since. Definitely a great read!
2,Very Annoying!,"I rarely find a book that I can't put down, but I can't seem to force myself to pick this one back up! It is extremely confusing to read and the writing is done in a way that you never know who is ""talking"". I haven't read this author before and I highly doubt that I will again. The story lines are too fractured and scattered. Leave this one on the shelf."
2,Not Up to Usual Standard for Noble,"This was such a disappointing book from Elizabeth Noble. She has been one of my favorite authors for years. I've eagerly awaited each of her new novels. This story-line was weak, stretched beyond belief, & actually very silly. The characters were not as interesting as Noble's previous novels. The characters of e Natalie's father & mother was well-drawn, but the author failed to develop them with any great depth. The parents were much more interesting than Tom & Natalie & their escapades. It seems like a ""hasty-write"" or a ""potboiler"" to me--maybe the author was too overwhelmed by her upcoming move to NYC to do justice to this book. Completely forgettable!"
1,Not made in USA,"Not happy, I'm returning this item. The description specifically says ""Made in USA"".On the box for the one I received, it says ""Made in China""."
3,Guide me!,"Decent overview for most injuries, doesnt help that 90% of them say ""call 911"" first, but I suppose they had to put that in there for people who lack common sense. Overall good read and study material if you're interested in the healing arts."
3,Toooo Lllooonnngg.....,Should have been edited way down. No point to most of the road trip. I may eventually get around to reading the next in the series but this one reduced my interest.
4,Well written and enjoyable,"I enjoyed this middle novel in the Golden Queen trilogy. It has doesn't have quite the same wide scope as the other two books, but is fun to read. I sometimes got lost in the ethical discussions. But the story is fast paced and intriguing and the characters ring true to what Wolverton had set up in the first novel. I highly recommend it!"
5,Between poetic realism and nouvelle vague,"During the occupation most of the french directors made entertainment films so as to avoid trouble with the german propaganda. But Gremillon chose contemporary themes, lumiere d'ete is reminiscent of La regle du jeu for example that became forbidden. The screen-play is complex, but also entertaining. Striking is the different background music and background noise just as the camerawork. The booklets of the edition have a lot of useful information."
5,This is Beyond Belief! Nearly f%ckin Perfect!,"Shameless, enhanced, fully saturated, amazing track list, under the ""guise"" of a ""live"" recording, TKK end up releasing a slamming ""Best Of"" !Considering how pre-programmed most of their instrumentation is, this could've been called ""In A Crowd/In A Vacuum"". The smashing element of this CD is that it consists of The Thrill Kill Kult's most dead-on, updated, ferocious, versions/mixes of all the songs included. ""Ride The Mindway"", in this incarnation, could give you an orgasmic annuerism, all by itself. Light years better than the ""Confessions..."" version.My only wish is that they included, ""Hour Of Zero"", and ""The Golden Strip"", so all the albums would be represented. ""Daisy Chain 4 Satan"", too, knowing how much more vicious it it ""Live"".This is easily one of My Life With The Thrill Kill Kults best-ever recordings. Death to trend-hoppers. Long Live TKK !BaRoN DaKoTA"
3,Decent..,"Although, I prefer some of the album versions over a few of the live tracks, especially Swine + Roses."
1,can I give this album a negative number?,"I have seen TKK in concert half a dozen time and have bean a big fan of theirs for 12 years since I first saw them in concert. I was really dissapointed in the last tour to the point where I actually had to walk out, the sound was bad the energy was bad it just wasn't the same band I have seen so many times and looked forward to seeing. when this live album came out I got it because I have everything they have recorded, I was skeptical because of my expierence at the concert but thought that maybe it was just a bad night. The album prooves it wasn't a bad night but a bad tour. I highly reccomend any TKK album, but avoid this one at all costs.. hopefully Groovy Mann and Levi can get the wheels back on the band and get back to awsome music."
5,A Song For A Child by Jerry Grillo,"This is a beautiful short collection of tunes for children.Originally recorded as an homage to the Elian Gonzalezcustody struggle, it now serves as an educational toolfor children who constantly wonder about their securityin this troubled world. Great songs, beautifullyexpressed by a singer who has worked with childrenthroughout his lifetime. This CD received a special mention in the New York Daily News on June 27, 2000 just before Elian left for his native Cuba with his father. Elian and his father werepresented with a copy as were President and Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Grillo's version of ""Summer Me, Winter Me"" by Marilyn and Alan Bergman has almost a holy feeling of comfort. This is a singer who ""feels"" what he is singing."
2,A piece of historically interesting but overwritten prose,"Lady Caroline Lamb wrote this book to punish Lord Byron for abandoning her, and in that she succeeded admirably. However, the modern reader will have to wade through a good bit of overblown prose to get to the story. Compare this to Les Liaisons Dangereuses and you'll understand why. I had always wanted to read Glenarvon, since it's cited so often in contemporary prose and modern Regency romances alike. Sadly, I found it disappointing."
2,Very light book... don't recommend it,"This book has nothing to offer, except for those of you who now nothing about Orisha Tradition, and are curious. Otherwise don't waste your time and money..."
5,In the True Tradition of Spiritual Growth,"Ifa Karade has taken the intrigue and desire for power and prestige out of the mix. He reminds us that indigenous faiths are about spiritual evolution, not personal manipulation.This book is straightforward, ""forward thinking"", and spiritually challenging. Its not a rehash of every book before it. It serve a unique place and quiet as kept, more than a few ""old school"" devotees would do well to let go of their egos and read the book. It has serious intentions written in a welcoming and light tone. Ase to Baba Ifa Karade. A Classic book on the religion."
5,Baba Ifa Karade shows through this book that he's ARIWAAJU!,"EXCELLENT,EXCELLENT!!! Baba shows through this very informative book that he's ariwaaju (True Adept of Ifa). The book has a solid approach to understanding the basis of the divinities and includes herbs,and comparisons with Christianity, Islam,and Chakras from far Eastern religions."
3,Good Info. Beware.,"I bought this book when I began my walk into the Ifa Tradition of Nigeria. The title it's self lends you to believe that the material covered inside will be an overview of said tradition. This however is not really the case, most of the information is inspired by the diaspora tradition of Lucumi/Santeria.The receiving of several necklaces at once (Elekes/Collares.) The receiving of, ""warriors"", as an initiation does not occur within the Traditional Modality of Ifa.Pro's-Great information for the neophyte. Easy read.Con's-Does not address the Yoruba Religious Concepts it claims to."
4,"Straightforward, good beginner information","This is actually a pretty good book for those first entering the realm of the Yoruba religion. It has some good straightforward beginner information.I don't agree with every aspect of this book however - as I dont see the need to constantly compare our religion to others, our elemental energies to chakras, etc. But simply because I don't agree with everything included does not change the fact that it is a good Yoruba primer."
1,Yuck!,Lousy recepton. Noisy and interference static when the mixer was less that ten feet away! Returned it immediately. Too cheaply made plastic item.
5,An Incredible Blend of Styles,"Where to begin with this CD? I've listened to Lagwagon for many years, and when I heard about Joey's new band, I had to take a listen and I was blown away. The beauty of ""If I Had a Son"" (which moved my mom to tears the first time she listened to it) to John Popper's harmonica on ""Our Greatest Year"", this CD is great from beginning to end. Definitely worth a listen, how often do you hear a cello on a ""punk"" CD?"
2,Worthless cheap product,"I was planning on use this rings to make egg patties for breakfast... Not anymore. To begin with out of the box only 1 out of the 4 rings would lay flat, every other ring leaks when I would pour yolk mix into them. After storing them away they got deformed and leaked even more next time.Save your money... I actually had better results using a can of beans cut-open on both sides!"
5,simple,"I love to bake and i wanted to make my own English muffins - like my popovers and other British pastries. These rings are no-brainers. Pour the batter in the rings on a griddle and poof, delicious and easy authentic bread. Cool. BTW, i used olive oil in the spray to keep them easy release."
1,Wretched,"I purchased these and got exactly one day's use of them before tossing them in the dish water to soak with the rest of my baking supplies.When doing the dishes later in the day, they were already showing signs of rust. I was absolutely floored! I would have assumed, and obviously was wrong for doing so, that cooking tools would be made of food grade stainless steel or, baring that, a metal with a rust-proof coating.I'd recommend staying away from these. Perhaps look for a silicon version?"
4,"Kinda cheap, but they still work","These rings are thin aluminum, so they are a bit cheap. They can bend and become mis-shapen quite easily. But you can get them back into shape quickly too. They work great, but do keep in mind that they will get very hot on your griddle or in your pan. Most dough is forgiving enough that you won't notice any slight imperfections in shape caused by bent rings.You can get more durable stainless steel tart rings or English muffin rings, but I'm not sure it's worth the added expense. I would just stick with these and if they get knocked out of shape, just bend them back. (And speaking of tart rings, these will work just as well for that, though they might be a bit large.)"
2,Works.. Kinda.,"So I have these English Muffin rings. They look like they'll work. I mean, they are made of metal and are circles. Seems simple enough. Nope. The rings are too light and don't stay down while batter is added. It runs underneath and makes kind of a mess. I fixed it buy adding another pan on top to make sure everything is tight, but that takes time and still makes a small mess. But it does work if you really want to make them at home. I now just buy them from the store again.Also, don't even try to do eggs in these."
1,They rusted,"I used them once, hand washed as I was towel drying them they had rust on them. I didn't leave them sit, I washed immediately. There are 2 small circles of metal to join them and that is where they rusted at."
5,Perfectly round,and they contain the dough. It is a fine marriage of form and function. The edge are rolled and can stay wet so it is important to dry them carefully when you put them away.
2,Damaged when received,"The box and rings were really bent when I received the product. I was able to bend them back into shape. Used them to make gluten-free buns, they work nice when sprayed with oil. The worked for what I was looking for."
3,thier ok,Their great for English muffins or thick batters but to fry an egg it leaks. Probably be a bit better if non stick.
5,English Muffin Rings,"I just received the Fox Run set of rings for making English Muffins and Crumpets. The rings appear to be well constructed and of durable material. I only ordered one set of four because I was unfamiliar with the brand and were so low priced that they may not hold up to continued use. After receiving the rings, I quickly determined that I should order two more sets thereby giving me the ability to make a full dozen muffins at one time rather than four. At $5.08 per set that will not pinch the pocketbook at all."
4,Nice.,"I bought these rings to try to make some gluten-free hamburger buns for my son. My attempt looked awful, but they were perfectly circular!"
3,English Muffin Rings,"The English muffin rings arrived quickly which was a nice surprise.They turned out perfect English muffins.I ran them through the dishwasher, took them out and allowed them to finish drying on a towel.They all rusted.I am not sure if they would rust had I hand washed them, but putting them through the dishwasher was obviously a mistake."
4,perfect egg muffins,"I purchased these to make english muffins (without high fructose corn syrup,thank-you) and I also use them to form round egg shapes to fit the muffins.They're a real buy! They work great!"
1,They rusted in the sink after one use.,Total waste of money. I used these once and then soaked them in the sink before cleaning and they rusted at the joints! I don't want to use something that rusts on my food so I threw them out.They were also poorly constructed. The metal was very flimsy and they didn't lay completely flush with the bottom of my pan. I used them to make eggs and some of the egg whites leaked out so they didn't really created perfect circles. I could have dealt with that but rusting was a deal-breaker.
1,Bitterly Disappointed,"I used these rings only once and they rusted after the first wash. The rust got into all of the seams, so it is impossible for me to even think about using them again. These were a complete waste of money and way too expensive for 'disposable' Muffin rings. Also, the metal is so flimsy that the rings warped even with hand washing - you get what you pay for in this case."
2,Essentually China-made junk,"Don't buy these. As is too much the case today, China-made products seem to be the new normal. I grew up using these cooking rings and the only reason I don't have my originals now is that I gave them to my son to use with his family (i.e., built to last). The rings I just bought won't last a year. Low quality ultra thin steel; where they are joined, there are sharp edges (that will rust); they are clearly junk that will never make it to a garage sale."
4,Wonderful Product,"I bought these so I could make my own hamburger buns, and the result is fantastic! Now, instead of the buns spreading a little as they bake, they get all the rise they should!The only downside is how easily these rust if you don't get them COMPLETELY dry.LOVE THEM!"
2,they're ring molds,"except they don't really stay too circular, which is pretty annoying. also they rusted almost instantly, which is kind of gross.but they work i guess"
2,Less Than Perfect,"I bought this skillet in mid-2007 because its size would be perfect for cooking bacon and pancakes. I liked the shape of the skillet and the comfortable handle (still do). I always use a low to medium flame on the gas range which makes cooking bacon or pancakes somewhat time-consuming. Nevertheless, after using the skillet for a few months, it warped in the middle, which caused uneven cooking. Then a few months later it lost its non-stick quality, and had to be oiled before every use. This was hard to understand because the skillet was always hand washed, never scoured, never used metal tools (even though the literature said this was okay) or put in the dishwasher. This was my second disappointing go-round with non-stick skillets and I learned a lesson. Though it is more expensive, stay with good stainless steel -- Cuisinart multi-clad is a great choice.Cuisinart Multiclad Pro Stainless 12-Inch Skillet with Helper"
3,Not Perfect,"My old square griddle warped quickly in cooking pancakes on our smooth-top range at a heat setting of 60%, and the outside cooked slower than the middle. After reeading the reviews of the Kitchen Aid 12"" round griddle, I purchased one in the hopes that these problems could be avoided. I tried cooking pancakes at lower settings, but they did not rise properly. When I finally raised the temperature up to 60%, the Kitchen Aid griddle warped also, and cooked slower around the edges."
3,Buy the Harry Potter 7 Collector's sticker book instead,"My son loved the Collector's Harry Potter 7 sticker book, so I bought this one, too. Unfortunately, the stickers in this book had a poor image quality. They were grainy and bit blurry; it looked like someone had taken a low-resolution photo of items from the film and turned them into stickers. He still enjoyed using the book, but I wasn't impressed with the cheap look of the stickers."
4,He can't remember,The story has you guessing who is the bad and who is the good? A man thrown into a situations and spends the rest of his life on the run and trying to piece together his involvement in the whole scheme of things.
4,Well written eye-opener,"I first came across Kersten's book in Kashmir, India. It was a revelation then and equally enjoyable on recently reviewing it. Information given in ""Jesus Lived in India"" has been taken further by the wonderful ""The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing years"" by Richard G. Patton. ""The Autobiography.."" confirms Kersten's remarkable work and shows remarkable insight into one of history's most enigmatic spiritual teachers. Fundamentalists will not sleep comfortably with this kind of publication being made available, but then again, history has always been written by the victor's - so perhaps we haven't been given the full story as Kersten claims. Kersten backs up his claims with archaeological evidence in a manner that is easilly digested. Thoroughly recommended."
5,serious and respectful point of view,"this is an amazing book. it does not sensationalize the serious issue of jesus' life and the catholicism. the author does not ""force"" you to believe nor tells you to draw any conclusion....he only presents the facts, his scientific studies and YOU draw your own conclusion. i believe that this is the way to present any controversial thought about this sensitive matter.....unlike ""trashy"" and irresposible writings such as the davince code, ""jesus lived in india"" touched my heart and made me think a bit further about what we really know...but again, the way the book is presented and written that is what makes jesus lived in india a MUST READ book."
2,"Close, but no cigar","The author does a good job pointing out the similarities between Jesus and other Eastern dieties, and there definetly was a connection between the Middle East and the Far East.However, the author fails to realize a simple truth: Jesus Christ did not actually live at all.Similarities between Jesus and gods of the Far East are due to a common widespread mythology in the ancient world that was spread by a brotherhood of priests, starting in Egypt and going as far east as China. ""Jesus Christ"" is a compilation of several mythological gods that pre-dated Christianity by hundreds to thousands of years.I strongly suggest ""The Christ Conspiracy"" and ""Suns of God"", by Acharya S. Much much better information to be found in both books.Jesus did not live in India. He did not live anywhere. He is a myth."
2,Would not suggest for real parrot owners,"This Parrot mix is not healthy enough for parrots. I have an African Grey and Blue Crowned Conure, these tropical parrots need more fruit and nuts, this mix is 75% millet or small seeds. I would suggest this mix for cockatiels or a Quaker parrot"
3,interesting yet slow-moving account of late Victorian life..,"'The Whirlpool' is an account of emerging middle class in London circa 1890. With it comes all the social trauma of trying to find a balance between work, rearing of children, and leisure. As with some of other Gissing's works he focuses more on the plight of the women wanting to be more than simple 'hausfraus'. Their desire for personal fulfillment while still be super-wife and super-mom is probably true to the feelings of many women today.However as 'The Whirlpool' chronicles the lives of select London families it does so at a very slow pace. The dramatic moments are very prosaic. Fortunately the narrative and characterisations make this to be a reasonably good read, especially for anyone interested in feminism and life during that period.Bottom line: on balance a decent book. However I recommend reading Gissing's 'New Grub Street' to really appreciate his writing talents."
2,Some plastic bristles,The brush I saw that was bought in a hair salon did not have any plastic looking bristles in the brush. This one does. I like the brush but wish it would have been 100% boars hair. Quick shipping thru Amazon! :0)
4,so much fun!,"We had about 10 of these kind of necklaces knocking around our house, and our kids loved them, and my husband decided to buy this huge boxful! Now, in addition to dressing up by wearing zillions of them, they will make play food out of them (stirring ""stew"" and making a ""birthday cake."") they will make piles of them into mountains... so far we've had them a month, and they're still all perfect and shiny and unbroken after tons of play. They come in great colors -- purple, gold, silver, green, red, and blue. When they first came out of the package, a few of them had tiny metal ""clips"" stuck to them, like staples... we had to scan through the pile of necklaces and find them all before giving them to the kids. Other than that, great. Super cheap for so many."
1,Spend your day getting wisdom teeth removed instead!,"Fassbinder inflicts his personal pain and suffering upon his viewers. I've seen graduate film students walk out of this film. In fact, the INSTRUCTOR of the class walked out as well. The relief felt when he/she finally commits suicide was not worth the utter hell of watching the protagonist's torment for two hours. The remaining students actually cheered when death finally ended not only his suffering but our own.Call me insensitive and closed-minded, but only after you have experienced this ordeal for yourself. This is the worst film this film instructor has ever seen."
4,Great history and demonstration of techniques,I really enjoyed this book it has the history of stitching and how it remains both a pratical and asthetic art form.i learned some of the basic techniques and how to finish a project for framing. i really enjoy it. i think it'a good book for any stitcher's library who is interested in the basics to hardanger to the history of thier craft.
3,Fine,"Have some spelling mistakes, in Withman work a good ortography is relevant. But it's free and that's appreciated, cause leaves of grass is maybe the best work of Whitman."
2,Waste of money,"I am a pro athlete who had hit a flatline on my work outs. I decided to try some powders to see if they gave results. I followed the directions for 45 days and have seen zero results. I work out 5 times a week and what I did get from the product was bad headaches. Perhaps it is from all the additives they put in there. I finally used it all but will not recommend, don't waste your money."
3,Works but is not very sturdy.,The Geospace Jump Rocket set works but is not very sturdy so one has to be careful and monitor use.
2,Hard to use,The stomping piece seems to want to remain in a state of decompression. The rockest don not fly as high as advetised. I do not recommend this toy.
3,Hard to keep in proper position for firing,"My 5 year old granddaughter has a hard time stomping hard enough on the air compressor to launch. If the hose gets crimped in any way, not enough air gets through to launch."
3,"Very Fun, but not durable","Bought this for my kids and took it on vacation with us. Rented a house with the extended family and this did not make it beyond a couple of days before it broke. Don't expect long lasting play with this. It does work well when it works. Rockets go high enough and the kids had fun with it, again while it worked..."
1,unable to operate,I gave with toy to my 6 year old grandson at our family get together a few days before Christmas. While the family was together we never got it to work. His mom seemed to think there may have been a hole in it that was keeping the air from activating the action. I was going to return it to you but my grandson wated to keep it and try to get it to work at home. It never worked properly.
5,Lots of blasting fun.,My 4 and 2 yr old love this. Rockets are safe for indoor use as well as outside. This thing can get some serious air outdoors. adjustable launcher is great for getting distance as well as height.
3,"Great fun...but buy the ""basic"" launcher instead of deluxe","My son was given the ""basic"" version of this stomp rocket and he has LOVED it! (he's 3.5yrs old). For Christmas I thought I would spend the extra money to get our 4yr old neighbor this ""deluxe"" version. The deluxe version is harder to ""stomp"" whereas the basic stomp rocket (about $5 less) is VERY easy."
4,Great Relief for Carpal Tunnel Sufferer!,"I purchsed this software to transcribe tapes, and it has really given me some much needed relief from heavy typing. I'm able to wear both the headphones for the transcriber and for via voice, and I just dictate what I'm hearing from the transcribed tape! The easiest way to dictate, I found, is directly through the pad, and just cut and paste into word. Also, regardless of how poor you think your oratory skills are, speaking in your natural tone of voice helps the software to ""learn"" your voice pattern much quicker. I have found that even when I stumble over words that I use all the time, if I just do the voice analyzer after every session, it becomes more and more accurate. For a girl with a southern twang and drawl, that saying a lot!"
1,horrible,"what a rip off! I put this item on my registry, because it matched the crib set...I never saw it until it arrived as a gift. I was thoroughly disappointed when it came & saw it was made of cheap plastic. The music was SOOOOOO loud, with no volume control--I was scared to use it in the evening when trying to put the baby to sleep! Not to worry though...by the time the baby was ready to sleep alone in the crib, the music box/turning feature broke altogether!! How frustrating, because I've had music boxes before and was EXTREMELY careful not to overturn. Now I have to go buy another mobile altogether, after someone paid $50 for this piece of junk at BabiesRUs."
2,Poor quality optics,"This was a disappointing set of filters.The UV filter, the main reason I bought the set, is not worth using on my 85mm f/1.8 lens. It causes pretty serious reflection artifacts.The polarizer is slightly useful, it doesn't do a very good job of filtering out reflections or darkening the sky.On the plus side, the filters do fit my lens.In buying this set, I learned the hard way that you can't use cheap filters on decent glass, without paying the price in image quality."
1,It is not good for Telephoto,"It may be fine for short range photos. But when you go to telephoto with good lens, these filters blur the image. If you do not have good lens like Zeiss, you may not notice. But if you have good lens, you will see some blur quite similar to image quite a bit of out of focus. It is my fault to try expensive lens with cheap filters. HD2 may be a misleading information since manufacturer brand itself these attributes, it should have some kind of regulator agency like ISO or FDA or other to test photo products and state if it is real HD2, or if it is OK for telephoto."
2,Good for Starters but not for Pro's,"This Product is good for starters and is good in terms of value for money, But for the Aspiring professionals and professional...i suggest don't spend your money on this buy some thing better."
2,Better to spend a little more money and get one nice filter,"I used these filters for a few months after I got them. After doing some research and taking a ton of pictures, I found that these filters really do not replace a set of nice (pricey) filters. These filters did not do a good job of improving the pictures in the way they were made to. I also had some serious issues with the threading on some of the filters. Either they would not screw into my lens or they would get stuck and not unscrew.I would not recommend buying these at all, it is really just a waste of your money. I haven't used them since I got them. Either get no filters or spend a little more and get a few much nicer filters."
1,Garbage,A total load of garbage. The polarizer has cracks in coating. I plan on replacing with either Canon or Hoya filters. Don't waste your hard earned cash.
3,Yerinden cikiyor :(,UV olan kendiliginden yerinden cikiyor. Yani vida disleri tutmuyor. Polarize olandan memnunum. Bu fiyat bundan iyisi beklenmez sanirim.
5,Top 10 list,"From the first time I heard this I knew I was addicted. It's one of those CD's you never get sick of. She has such a beautiful voice, and every song makes you want be her. I have completely memorized this entire CD and it is a must no matter what kind of music you normally listen to."
2,Not Backwards Compatible,"HA! We misplaced our Roady 2 somewhere at the hospital and no one returned it to lost and found. Our car has the Roady 2 Car kit installed by CarToys which cost $320 for installation. Unfortuantely, the Roady XT is not compatible with the prior car kits, which means we would have to pay for Roady 2 car kit removal and new Roady XT car kit installation, meaning a whole nother $320 or more. Something so trivial as this. Therefore we cannot use new technology... Our only economical choice is to be stuck in the past replacing the lost Roady 2 with another Roady 2."
1,roady XT STINKS,"Unit hasn't worked since it was bought. If you want to return it, be prepared to suffer. You'll have to call their returns department (no information on returns online-SURPRISE!). They'll have you in queue for 45 minutes THEN tell you that you need the ID number from the unit. Complain to the service representative and be prepared to be abused. They have the MEANEST customer service agents I've ever talked to. DON'T SUPPORT THIS COMPANY BY BUYING THIS PRODUCT!"
5,Replacement,This is a replacement for one we have. Really like that It comes with a remote. It lets people in the back seat enjoy the musicchoice aswell.
5,best XM radio I've had,"I have had TWO of these (one for each car) for the last 5-6 years and never had any problems. This little baby is a workhorse. It's small, easy to use, and it works great. I take pretty good care of mine, but it is a portable radio, so I take it in and out of the cars with me, putting it in a little ""camera"" case and stowing it away in a pocket or purse. No problems ever. Works every time I plug it in.If you are looking for something portable, this is a good radio to get. Not the best looking radio or with the best display, but it does the job and keeps working!"
1,Not in any way Plug-N-Play,"I purchased this because it claimed it was Plug-N-Play and you did not need a cassette player. When I received it I found that to install without using the cassette adapter could take up to 30 minutes and was expected to provide less quality sound. Installation involved routing wires around the car. I ended up paying an experienced installation technician for 2 hours of installation. If you want to use the casette adapter, it is plug-n-play, otherwise, good luck!"
2,Poor sound quality,"Changed from Sirius to XM. Bought this unit and the sound quality is terrible. Sounds like the Treble and Mid is turned all the way down. Almost like listening to a sound system w/o tweeters. Of course I checked my equalizer settings and all is good. Tested inside the house on the home stereo, my stereo in the garage and my wife's vehicle as well. Same results. Very confused as I have the Delphi Boombox at work wired into a cheap stereo and the sound quality is great. I bought a new Roady and tried it.... Same thing. Very muffled w/ almost a hiss sound. If you are looking just for the signal and sound, it's not bad. If you expect a quality sound, this is not the unit to buy. As a pro dj for over 10 years and a car stereo installation tech of over 20 years, I have a decent idea of how wiring works as well as how sound quality should be. If you are not picky about sound quality, this is for you. Want to hear every detail a song has to offer, this is not for you."
1,Long time XM subscriber,On my 3rd unit. Antenna and power connection somehow always short out. I have purchased replacement parts. Although this unit never leaves my car. I do pick it up periodically to change channels. When I explained my issues with the unit to XM I was told unit was not meant to moved at all and that is why those connections keep shortening out.......Not happy with this unit.
2,"error message is ""antenna""","After 3 years, it just started saying ""antenna"" (indicating there is not a good antenna connection). I put on another antenna and got the same ""antenna"" error message. I guess the receiever unit has reached the end of its short life. It worked nicely prior to that, so it gets 4 stars for working nicely for 3 years, but zero stars for dying on me, so that's an average of about 2 stars."
5,Delphi Roady XT Satellite Radio,Great little unit. Built-in FM transmitter works great. Great reception. Easy to operate.
2,Service O.K. But modulator is VERY weak.,"I purchased the newer model 'Roady' to replace the earlier model. This one has an extremely weak modulator which I need to find a remedy. The older model broadcast a decent signal that could be picked up within 50 feet on other radios and personal sound devices. This newer model broadcasts a signal about three inches. The plugs have changed and the older modulator cannot be used with the newer model Roady.Needless to say I am very disappointed in the performance so far.Pros- XM satellite signal has improved over the last year with out requesting the signal to be re sent to our receiver, which was a real pain."
5,Excellent story,"I loved this book. Yes, there are swear words. But these books are tended more for an young adult/adult audience than children.Swearing is more permissable now. Simon has done a remarkable job characterizing the 4th Doctor and Leela just like they were in the series. I couldn't put it down; it's somewhat X-Files like, but much,much better. Give it a chance; just because there is swearing in it doesn't make it a bad story, it gets very good by the middle of the story!"
2,Half and Half,I found half of the book to be pretty interesting especially a weird ice creature killing or invading the victim. I didn't see much of the doctor and leela in it though. This would still pass for a good book if it wasn't a doctor who book.Sometimes I skipped ahead to see what the doctor would do. So I'm half disappointed in it but half ok with it.
2,Doctor Who ???,"I am sorry to say after reading this book I was sadly disappointed. I titled this review ""Doctor Who ???"" because the Doctor is hardly the main character. In fact Leela and the Doctor are minor characters that appear sporadically throughout the book. This story drags on with a dizzying array of underdelveloped characters. Characters are still being introduced 3/4 of the way through the book. Also the Doctor is referred to as 'Doc' not only by the characters in the book, but by the book itself, which I found particularly annoying.Not only is the plot slow to delvelope, you never get a significant closure, which I detest. If you are a serious Doctor Who fan lured in by a new novel fearturing the 4th Doctor and Leela, I would take a pass on 'Drift'."
1,Awesome Cover...but disapointing story...,"The cover of this book is awesome. All would agree with that. However, after just a few pages of reading I had to put the book down. Many words are present which one is not accustomed to seeing in a Doctor Who book. Words such as bi-ch, G-d d--n, and sh-t. One reads/watches Dr. Who to escape into other worlds and wonderful stories. Reading such foul language to me is not entertaining. I would thus not recommend this book."
1,DON'T BUY THIS GAME,MY FRIEND GOT THIS GAME THINKING IT MAYBE LIKE BATTLE TANK BUT ITS REALLY CHEAP ITS THE SAME THING EVERY LEVEL.3DO ALWAYS MAKES CHEAP GAMES. THEY HAVE A GOOD IDEA LIKE ARMY MEN BUT IT'S CHEAP. ITS OK FOR A LITTLE KIDS UNDER 9 THAT DON'T NO THE DIFFRENTS BUT DON'T PAY MORE THAN $10 FOR IT.
5,MCSE Windows NT Workstation 4 For Dummies,"Very nice book. This book concentrates on passing the exam instead of a ""everything you ever wanted to know about workstation"" kind of book. The 120 day evaluation of NT workstation is nice, as well as the practice exams, scenario book, and audio Q&A CD. You gets loads of things to study. This book helped me to score a 933/1000 on my 70-073 exam."
2,it's ok,"Nice book but it doesn't have much nice things to do. I expected a bit more for the price. For a begginer it's ok. But nothing special. Fast shiping and good quality book, thank you!"
1,Garnishing A Feast for the eyes,"This book is way too basic, very few illustrations and the print is extremely small. I would NOT recommend this book to even basic beginners."
1,not a good book,this book was not what i exspected it is not a garnish feast for my eyes think an 11 year old can do these things just simple not attractive...just has a pretty front not even a rose the vegetables are crappy things like cucumbers cabbage sweet peper what can be dun with dese not much
4,Very concise for the apprentice.,I found that this book is very helpful for the novice/trainee in buffet garnishing. It has been of great help for me in training my staff in our hotel. The templates are a great aid for those that are somewhat artistically talented and have a natural ability to translate a picture to the actual food product in the practice of garnishing.
5,Amaze your friends with your culinary artist skills!,"Want to be the hit of the party? Buy this book! Everyone remembers the food after a party and this book will help you create memorable food art. Francis has shared his secrets and ideas to make an ordinary presentation an extraordinary presentation. With a few fruits or vegetables and some simple and creative cuts, this wonderful book can make you look like a culinary artist.Francis gives great directions with color photos of the finished projects. At first I thought there is no way I can carve a swan, but I just did what he said and voila - I created a beautiful centerpiece on my first attempt. I never fail to get oohs and ahhs over the swans (and other garnishes) I make.I've given my copy(ies) of this book to people that have shown tthat they would like to do the same things. If you want to add some pizzazz to the table - BUY THIS BOOK!"
3,Not Enough Illustrations,Not near enough illustrations of the how-to-do process and the items shown are not ones I would like especially.
4,Helpful Bible Study Tool,"If you utilize the NRSV for preaching and teaching in your congregation, then this is a very helpful tool. Each lesson is commented upon in language that is clear and precise and ""preachable."" In some instances, the content of the commentary presupposes that the reader has some experience with critical or historical examinations of biblical texts, although if one uses the NRSV, that is probably not an incorrect presupposition. Overall, the commentary is clear and thought provoking and helps the preacher/teacher open up the texts nicely."
1,cabin air filter,they said it would fit and it does not it does not even have a cabin filter i shure hope i can send it back
2,Doens't Run far...,This thing maybe moves a foot on a hardwood floor. On carpet it can barely manage 6 inches. Pretty flimsy too but also not pricey.
3,"Basic cat toy, no frills here.","This toy is plush with a tail that can be pulled that makes it vibrate across a hard floor. However, my cat just likes to smack the thing around like a ball and really dislikes the high amount of noise the toy makes when you pull the tail. The noise actually deters the cat. If your cat is sensitive to loud or sudden noises, I don't recommend investing in this one."
2,running?,"You pull the tail ,it goes a foot, that's not running. Running to me means it scoots across the room,and my cat chases it. This is in the box of cat toys my cats don't use."
2,Okay,"I actually bought this book for my sister,who owned it some years ago but lost it.When it finally arrived(on the very last day they gave in the arrival parameters) I sat down and read it.That didnt take long. I'm sure the author was limited by the many unmarked graves that exist there now,but I kind of expected more. Especially for the $32.00 price tag."
4,You ain't just whistlin'Dixie!,"I've lived in Georgia all my life and I always thought the most mysterious thing about the state was why we keep supporting the Atlanta Falcons. Jim Miles book details more amazing oddities.This is a great guidebook for those who want to see the biggest state east of the Mississippi in a different light. Miles' well researched book not only tells about such odd things as the Georgia Guide Stones, but it also tells how to find them. I couldn't put this book down. This summer I am going to go on a mystery excursion right here in the old Peach State using Jim Miles' book as a road map."
2,somewhat disappointing,"I am not sure what I was expecting but I found this book to be somewhat tedious after getting through a good portion of it. Parts of it were just downright boring, and I never finished the book as I just couldn't get throught it."
2,Are you serious?????,This movie is straight home made. the acting and picture is trash and the film is boring from beginning to end. Do not get this movie i rented it and the main actor is the worst i ever seen. Other members are trying to sell there copies that is why they gave it 4-5 starsbut -negative 1 million for me
5,AWESOME!,"When I first picked up the Zion Covenant, I just can't believe how great the story really is! I felt the heartache and joy Elisa and Murphy experience, and with all the other characters, I can't help but feel like I'm part of the story myself. This series is the best I've ever read."
5,I just can't put them down!,"These books are absolutely fantastic! And this is from someone who hardly reads any Christian fiction. The author is able to portray the characters so vividly that I can almost feel their joy, relief, pain, fear and sorrow. The circumstances surrounding WWII and the plague that befell the Jews are told with such immaculate details. And the author does a wonderful job keeping the narrative flow even though the settings span from Austria to England to Jerusalem. Simply a page-turner!"
5,I am a history buff and I also liked these books,"These books are good, even if you are really interested in historical accuracy. The great thing about them is they can really inspire one to do their own research and learn themselves about what was going on during that time. The interactions between the characters and famous historical figures aren't factual, of course, but the major events are accurate. These books really inspired me to do my own research and to visit the cities that the characters inhabit. I really enjoyed reading them, so if you love history, don't let the fiction aspect scare you away, it often serves as a fun backdrop in which real learning can take place."
1,Contributes to the Problem,"Poorly organized and inaccurate, this book should not have been brought to print in such a state. Furthermore, for one who respects the constituent dance forms of this music, I was particularly appalled by the confusing and misinformed section on dance. We do need more well-researched, english language resources on this subject--this unfortunately cannot be defined as such."
3,Interesting but...,"I liked the fact that we have more books on Latin music, and this is interesting but the organization of material could have been better. The history is rich in detail and it would have been nice to have an encyclopedia style section of who's who in salsa and Caribbean music, much like ""The Billboard Guide to Tejano and Regional Mexican Music,"" on Billboard Books by Ramiro Burr. Those artists essays are crisp and succinct, telling the essential style and accomplishments of various bands in norteno, trio, Tejano, conjunto, banda, etc. This salsa book too could have spelled out the top players in bachata, merenegue, bomba, etc."
