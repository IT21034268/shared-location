3,The Better Side of Faulkner,"This is the better side of Faulkner: deep and layered, without burying the intent in incomprehensible subtleties. Strong characters, strong framing, strong dramatic arc, and strong themes make this one a comparative pleasure to read. It still suffers from Faulknerisms - including perhaps more length than was necessary and the inevitable obscurities in the answers to some of the plot's primary questions, but if someone is just starting out on Faulkner, this is the one I would recommend choosing first."
5,The book for the first time Faulkner reader to start with.,"Light in August by William Faulkner is the book for the first time Faulkner reader to start with. The book is very readable. Unlike some Faulkner stories, the story line is easy to follow. His verbosity is not as apparent in this work as in some of his others where lengthy sentences and tangent monologues within the story derail the reader. The plot is more typical than any of his other works. The average reader will appreciate the book and get a hunger to dip into other works by this southern master writer.Read and reviewed by Jimmie A. Kepler"
4,"Not the ""Best of"" but entertaining !","It was so much fun watching these old episodes ! I only gave it 4 stars because although I liked it,I don't feel it was the ""best of"". It seemed like some random episodes thrown together. I think the people who put this together didn't put enough thought into it or just used what was available ? I liked it because this is the only video of Match Game I was able to find and it was fun to relive those old moments. It would be nice if they could produce a proper collection of this and other classic game shows !? I have mixed emotions on this one. When I purchased this it was $4 and it was worth the price I paid just to see it,but if I truly wanted the ""best of"",I would have been disappointed. Gene Rayburn(the host),the contestants and the panel,the clothes,hairstyles and the seventies feel make this all worth while."
3,Confused?...........,"Is this a re-release of the set was out previously, or is it all new material? Would love to see an sdditional 30 episodes of this show!"
5,60's SciFI at it's BEST,"Excellent show. The 1st Season is the best IMHO. BTW, The listed original Air Date for the pilot episode is incorrect. I think it premiered in September 1965."
5,Image quality is State of the Art,"If you are buying this, you already know why you are buying it. What amazing technology for 1965 TV. The musical scores are awesome (get the CD's!). The picture quality is absolutely top shelf, better than the original film quality and digitized to perfection. I too would like to thank FOX for putting Lost in Space out on DVD since we can't watch it on TV anymore. My pre-order for season 2 and 3 is yours for the asking and I hope a business decision isn't the only reason you look at releasing it for! If it is, make the price worth it as we Yuppies love the show and will gladly pay handsomely for such great quality."
3,Not as good as I remember,"I too used to watch this show when it originally aired. I loved it then. It's just not nearly good as I remembered.It is an average written, average acted, low budgeted, science fiction show from the past that should have stayed there. The memory of it is better than the actual show.I could state many well thought out reasons why I feel this way to support my opinion. It simply would not matter. I know that I will most likely receive dirty looks and nasty comments about my opinion. Too many people confuse nostalgia with good all around family entertainment.For the record, I still love the theme song. :)"
4,A stroll down memory lane,"We remembered Lost in Space as being so 'futuristic'. Of course, seeing it now it's pretty hokey, but fun. One thing I have definitely decided--it's really too bad they didn't get rid of Dr Smith shortly after they discovered him on the ship--boy is he a pain!I recommend this series for anyone who grew up in the 1960's!"
5,Can't beat the orginal's,"Owning the first episodes is awesome. I never really knew what the deal was with dr. Smith till now. I came around when the show was in color and playing on movies till dawn (aging myself here) It's alot of fun to watch even my 16yr old and 4yr daughters are getting into. I bought this as a Father's day present for my ""hard to find a gift he would really want and like"" artistic husband and he was more than pleased"
5,Found on earth !!!,"Loved it as a kid, and it's still just as good as an adult. All the characters are great, but I appreciate John Robinson more now as an adult. Of course, Dr. Smith steals the show !!!!"
5,The clock comes full circle,"Growing up in the early/mid-60s while watching the astronauts climbing to that special event of reaching the moon, ""Lost in Space"" was an added dimension taking us to places that stretched the imagination. I was glued to that TV series and fell in love in ""Penny"" played by Angela Cartwright. She was my sweetheart. Many years later I took my seven year son to see the film. Later, he had revealed to his mom that he fell in love with ""Penny"" played by Lacey Chabert!The series still has me captivated. As we learn of the recent ""earth like"" planet discoveries, maybe some of them are just like that envisioned in the series."
4,Has Violence Been Cut Out Of Episodes?,"I have just been re-watching Season 1 and am concerned that ""Return from Outer Space"" has had a cut.Will Robinson steals a bottle of carbon tetrachloride and runs out of the store.Next thing we see is Will and the store owner talking to the Sheriff outside the store.Was an action scene cut out or is it just poor continuity?"
5,Through the Eyes of a 10 Year Old Boy,"I was born the year and month Lost in Space premiered so I did not get to experience it until the early 1970s. Oh how I remember being so excited when I was a little boy because every summer Lost in Space was was rerun. I was glued to my tv set. Sure the f/x are dated and can be cheesy looking...but when I watch Lost in Space I still watch it through the eyes of a 10 year old boy.It is so cool having it in DVD format. Although it does not have very many extras other than the unaired pilot and a presentation film to the sponsors, it is well worth the money. Most tv shows have only 22 episodes per season but back in the 60s more were produced so this collection has 29 (plus the unaired pilot). Come to think of it, LIS had 83 episodes so that would be around 4 seasons now instead of the three years it ran in the 60s. Anyhow, this dvd is well worth the purchase to this man still watching Lost in Space through the eyes of a 10 year old boy."
3,DVD's lack in picture quality,"Lost in space is a great series, however I was disappointed in the picture quality of the DVD's. The quality is not up to where DVD's are. It is not horrible, but I can tell that it comes nowhere near other black and white DVD's in sharpness, quality, etc. Does anyone else concur that these are not up to Par where they should be? Seems to be a pattern overlaying the video, almost as if it was transferred from laserdisc or something else. This does not look like remastering in its finest hour. However, it does blow away VHS tapes.Also, on the final episode, there is a preview for the next episode in color. So you can get a preview of what the color episodes will look like. It is episode 29 ""Follow the leader"" at the end."
4,Lost in space at its best,"Season one of Lost in space was definitely the best. It's vintage science-fiction filmed in black and white. LIS started out as a serious science-fiction show. The show's first season was the best of the three seasons it was on the air; Very good for its day. Too bad they went off the track, though, turning the series into an oft-times campy, silly fantasy. But, I highly recommend season one for any science-fiction fan who doesn't mind a look at sci-fi in its early days. If LIS had maintained its original sci-fi path, it would have given Star Trek a run for its money."
5,Lost in Space the series...season 1,"Was very pleased with the product. Came alot earlier than I expected and was in great shape. I had ordered earlier from another sellar and when I got it the first disk was missing,....but they refunded my money and by then Amazon had the series and it was even a little cheaper. This one was new and the other used...and though it was in good shape..the first one from someone else was missing a DVD and this one was brand new...and cheaper. We are very very pleased."
5,Message from Switzerland,"I saw ""Lost in Space"" (""Perdus dans l'espace"") when I was a boy of 8-10 years old. It was such great fun. It was never more on our channels, but I never forgot the serial. Of course I saw them synchronized in french. I now discover the stories in the original language, and more than 30 years later they have lost nothing of their charm. I'm looking forward for the next seasons !"
5,"""Lost In Space"" is An All-Time Classic TV Series!","This is a great collection of a wonderfully entertaining series. God bless Jonathan Harris. He was a mesmerizing talent. Was there a boy or girl in 1965 who wasn't enchanted by his ""Dr. Smith"" character? All I can say is: ""It's about time!"" Now maybe seasons two and three will also be released on DVD."
2,That' s the problem with LIS. It was aimed at 8 year olds.,"Stephen has aptly summed up the problem with Lost In Space. It WAS aimed at 8 year-olds. Those of us who were around 16 when it came out found it unsophisticated, boring, and silly fluff compared to the far more intellectually stimulating Star Trek. That's why the Lost In Space movie bombed too - it was as awful as the TV show - while Star Trek spawned a number of superb films and all manner of stellar spin-off TV series. Long live Star Trek. Lost In Space was a yawner. . ."
2,"Not Worth The ""Lost Space"" In Your Home","Only television fans who have cash, time and shelf-space to burn should consider acquiring this boxed set, and only then if they have a strong masochistic streak. How could this series have been so popular?Admittedly, the production values of the DVD boxed set itself are quite high. It's a well-made and attractive set. But the show itself is nearly unwatchable. The first few episodes are so sluggishly paced and woodenly acted, with such protracted pauses in the dialogue, that they seem endless even without the commercials.A big disappointment. What promised to be a nostalgic and campy pleasure turned out to be a tedious waste. I have been unable to bring myself to watch the entire set; I can but hope the later episodes were an improvement."
3,Great Series But MY Package Had Seen Better Days,"THis series was a great time for young kids in the 1960s. I purchased a used copy of season one and it appears my set had been lost in space for some time. Some of my discs won't play on my DVD player, the package was beat like a red-headed stepson, and the jewel casings showed great amounts of wear. Of course it WAS advertised as used but perhaps Amazon should include another condition listing: ABUSED."
4,A great Blast from the Past!,"I watched this show growing up and had many fond memories of it's fun campiness. I was not disappointed with this set other than the fact that the only extra included was the unaired pilot on the last disc. Some interviews with the stars,who are still alive, about their days on the show would have been nice. A featurette about the special effects would have been nice too. But if you loved the show you'll still like this set for it's clear picture and sound, and its' uncut, unedited, uncluttered episode presentation. If you see it on tv today, at least 6 minutes of the show is cut to make room for commercials, these episodes are completely intact, at approximately 51 minutes long each. The last episode of this set last bit transitioned the show from black & white to color."
5,Anxiously waiting for season 2 and 3 !,"Please I can't wait for the season 2 and 3 to be released on DVD. Hey FOX executives, what r u waiting for? Lost In Space is just a masterpiece ahead of its time. Still today it's so great to watch all those effects again. Just superb! 10 out of 10!"
3,Lost In Space Season 1,Remember how cool this show was when you were young?I suggest you don't ruin those fond memories by purchasing this and seeing how lame it actually was. :)
1,I hated Dr. Smith and Robot,"Those two were the most annoying characters ever on any Tv show, the whole cast looked and acted stupid. Even that big budget movie they made in the 90's was a flop because it was even worse in concept and script."
4,Lost In Space all seasons,"I liked Lost In Space when I was a child and remembered all the dramatizations in the series from space monsters, alien beings, strange occurrences that could not be explained by the family lost in space, and just everyday human nature which some times conflicted with the unknown realm. Why are we so fascinated with space and seeking out our galaxy? What would be the possibilities if we discover life some where else? For me this was the real epic of the ""Lost In Space"" series inspite of its flaws. T.V. shows were not always well scripted and ""Lost In Space"" also had a humerous side to the show."
4,Great SciFi TV Series,"I didn't watch much Sci Fi, but loved ""Lost in Space.Many of those who loved the ""Lost in Space"", ""I dream of Jeannie"", ""Bewitched"", ""Flipper"" and ""Gentle Ben"" TV series in their childhood also liked ""Kentucky Jones"" (Dennis Weaver) and ""The Farmer's Daughter"" (Inger Stevens).I wish these wonderful old TV series and many others like ""Yancy Derringer"", ""A Man called Shenandoah"" (Robert Horton), ""The Detectives"" (Robert Taylor), ""Hank"" (Dick Kallman), ""He and She"" (Paula Prentiss), ""The Magic Boomerang"", ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" (Jack Palance), ""Adventures of the Seaspray"" would finally be released on DVD.The Baby Boomers would be more than happy about it!!!"
3,Lost in Space - The Complete First Season,The best family centered Science Fiction TV series ever made. Only the First Season shows were the best. Back then the Robot was still a Robot not a full family member. And Dr. Smith had some really sinister plans for the Robinson family before he just got silly in later seasons. My wife and I sat there enjoying scenes that we had remembered from years ago.
1,stickers do not stick,"My son really liked the design of the stickers, however the stickers are pealing off of every surface they are placed on. Finally we had to use superglue to get the stickers to stick."
4,our common illiteracy: education as if the earth and people mattered,"The best summary of our unsustainable condition and a true source of hope. This work is loaded with great references and seamlessly links one excerpt to the next. This book has left me feeling informed and optimistic. There is great work to be done, and this book lays it out simple and clear."
3,"""Nice""--but questionable choice of songs","It's a strange quirk of many modern bands that they'll release singles that do NOT appear on their albums. So it was that when The Boss Martians got around to doing their first full-lengther, some 9 songs had come out previously-- NONE of which appear here, and most of which would have helped the overall quality of the disc. So while I love this band, this is my LEAST favorite of all their records to date. It's not a complete loss, though; highlights for me are ""You Better Run, Girl!"", ""Hey Tina!"" and ""Best Little Girl"". They also do a version of ""Batman"" (but where's the middle of the song?). Well, they got better-- ""THE JETAWAY SOUNDS OF THE BOSS MARTIANS"", ""13 EVIL TALES"" and ""INVASION OF THE LIVE BOSS MARTIANS"" are all major improvements over this one (even if 2 of them are tougher to find)."
4,Confused Student,"A bit old-fashioned, but that seems to be one of its strengths. I feel like no one book does a very good job of describing quantum field theory, but some books do a good job of describing some parts of the subject. And this book does a good job describing propagator methods, or Green's functions, which in other texts seem pulled out of the author's butt."
4,The classic book on QED.,"This book is in many way a very good book. Despite being written 35 years ago, it is still sometimes used in classes. It is perhaps a little terse, but overall is a good introduction to the subject"
1,Old and outdated,"This book is now quite old, being edited in 1964.The Quantum Electrodynamics part is still OK, despite some typos;it is terse and not recommended for the beginner.The weak and strong interactions parts are incredibly outdated:The Weak Interaction part is totally based on Fermi punctual theory,now superseded by the Electroweak thory.The Strong Interaction says nothing about quarks and gluons;again, the book is from 1964.If you want to know about such matters try Dr Walter Greiner books."
3,Nice coffee table/reception room book,"Other reviewers either loved this book or hated it. The photographs are probably more impressive than the written content, and I think that baby boomers might like it better than the children or grandchildren of baby boomers. Lots of nostalgic photos. It filled in some of the gaps in my knowledge, but as one of the other reviewers has stated, there is more detailed information to be found elsewhere."
5,An excellent tarot deck for those studying Egyptian Wicca,"The other reviewer was right about this not being a deck for beginners, but for me, as a student of Egyptian Wiccan ways and an avid Egyptophile, this has been a very useful deck. I've never gotten clearer, more accurate readings than I do with this deck."
4,turning my makita drivers into drills,This is the perfect set to turn your drivers into drills. Most of my work with my makita 12v is to drive screws in and out. I occasionally need to drill a hole and these bits are fine. I resisted buying a dedicated chuck for standard bits but would have if I was doing a lot of drilling. My only complaint with this package is it would have been good to have a travel case to prevent the bits from rattling around and dulling the edges. I cut my packaging so I could remove the bits and slide them back in the packaging to avoid dulling. Good size selection and sturdy so far.
2,Smallest bit spun out,"Smallest bit spun out of its holder on first use, rendering it useless. I had to get a drill with a chuck to remove it from the guitar neck I was drilling. All I was doing was pre-drilling a hole in a guitar neck for a strap button."
4,Good quality at fair price.,"I've learned to avoid cheap tools, especially in cases where metal parts need to hold an edge. These are good quality at a reasonable price."
2,No case?,"These bits are very well made but once you open the package they will tumble about and stray in your toolbox. Like many of their other items they should have considered some sort of case or containment so they don't get lost. The 2 stars is only for the lack of package, not the bits which work very well."
3,Dewalt DW2551 6 piece Hex Shank Twist Drills,"First very careful use of the 1/4"" drill broke in two while drilling into sheet-rock plaster ? Oh well the other drills seem to be holding up okay. I chose this product assuming that the drills would be more durable than the 12 hex drill set made in china but I don't think they are any better quality at all. Next time I will buy the bigger cheaper set."
3,Cute but more hassle than it is worth,"This product is definitely cute for a Halloween party but it is really not worth it. You will get a headache trying to blow it up (a pump or something is recommend if you have one) and the air leaks out like crazy. It only fits about one case of beer/soda, so you really can't use it as your only cooler. I would recommend spending more money to get one of the larger blow up Halloween coolers."
2,Beautiful but the birds don't like it,"While this feeder is beautiful to behold, the orioles would much rather use the hummingbird feeder next to it...even though it means contorting to reach the feeder hole.Not recommended."
3,Oriole Bird feeder,"This is a very pretty feeder. Once hung, it seems not to be able to flow from the glass container into the feeder bowl. I have to tip it every so often to let it bubble. There are no bee guards. I also had this same type of hummingbird feeder with the same problems."
1,Don't waste your money on this feeder,"My finches and orioles keep the hummingbirds chased away from their feeder so I bought this oriole feeder. If a bird lands on it, it dips and spills the nectar on the ground and so far only 1 finch has figured out how to use it. They all prefer the hummingbird feeder so I now have 2 of them. This oriole feeder goes in the trash."
2,poor quality,"As received, the two-piece plastic base was poorly assembled and could not hold water. Fortunately, it was so badly made that the problem was obvious. After much fiddling to mate the pieces together as intended, it still leaked. The parts were warped and did not line up well. A tube of crazy glue completed the construction of this product, creating a leak-free reservoir. The plastic threads on the base looked trouble-prone, but did screw together satisfactorily with the glass tank. Looking at the placement of the perches, I wonder if a Baltimore Oriole (what I get) will be able to use this feeder. Be sure to mount with perches pointing down, not up. Will try bending them further down to increase the distance from feeder ports. It is a very attractive feeder, but will look even better if the orioles use it."
2,Attractive but needs to be redesigned,"This is a very attractive feeder, but it needs to be redesigned to be more friendly to orioles. When I received mine I found that the perches were much too short for orioles to sit and feed comfortably from the nectar holes. After assembling the feeder and comparing its perches to those of other oriole feeders offered on the internet, I returned the feeder to the seller. This was with some regret because I thought it was quite beautiful in appearance. The illustration doesn't show the birds actually feeding so one doesn't know if they can easily drink the nectar. This product was a disappointment, but I think it could have been redesigned to make a more oriole friendly source of nectar and a really beautiful addition to one's garden."
1,Fell Apart in a Gust of Wind,"Disappointed with this flawed item! It seemed so solid when I bought it (glass jar, heavy plastic, metal). But the threads of the jar and bottom feeder don't mesh securely. The feeder part spins rather than tightens up. With only one cup of nectar in the jar (it hold four cups, the bottom FELL OFF in a gust of wind. I wonder if the paint is too thick or threads not cut deep enough. Whatever the reason it's being returned."
1,No more DeWalt items for me.,"I received this yesterday, after several extra days of the USPS sending it all over the West Coast before they decided to finally send it to me, but after using it my ire, first caused by USPS, only increased.This drill may be able to eat, and I do mean chew, its way through soft wood, but for anything harder you will be wasting your time and money. After drilling five holes through a 18 gauge flat sheet of aluminum it was finished. On the sixth hole it just spun but didn't cut.This Chinese manufactured drill bit is made out of cheap metal that is just a bit harder than the aluminum that I was trying to drill eight holes in. The last new DeWalt item I bought, a circular saw, was made in Mexico, but has performed well for the past 8 months. But since it now seems that DeWalt has changed to having its products made in China, after more than 40 years of me buying their products, that ends my relationship with DeWalt."
4,"Yes, this actually works","It seems odd that you need to 'break in' this simple device but you need to. After following the directions, it works like a charm.I make a lot of small stuff and I continually need to stop and rotate the part in the vise. I was doing these small spindles for a bookcase. 4 spindles x 4 rows x 2 sides x 4 sides per spindle = a helluva lot of time waiting for the sander to wind down. This thingamajiggie probably cut down the time needed by half. Really. No kidding.If time is money, this investment started making profits for me the first day I owned it. Still, it seems awfully expensive for what it is. So, it only gets 4 stars.UPDATE: I paid $24 for mine. I see that these are now selling for about $15. So, I'd give it a five."
1,Why did I buy this??,"Can't remember why I thought I needed this sander sitter. You have to set the sander down in it perfectly or it spins off the bench. If using a variable speed on highest setting the whole thing will ""walk"" off the bench if you leave it running more than a few seconds. First time my sander hit the floor I was a little more than upset. The whole mech is too light. As for the cleaning aspect, with the new stearite disks you can get, here on Amazon and from suppliers like Klingspor, you are hard pressed to ever load em up anyway. It's another one of those ""good ideas"" that just doesn't transfer from concept to actual use very well. If you just really have to have one, let me know, I'll send ya mine for the cost of postage. Can't recommend this one."
1,Save your money...,"My orbital sander certainly won't sit (running) on this; the base is too light and rotates around, essentially it is useless.The thing is actually too small for a 5"" sander. The instructions say to ""fold up the edges"" of the sanding disc so it will fit inside the holder. Huh? Why not just make it 1/2"" bigger?I *does*, however, make a convenient place to put my coffee cup!"
1,Save your money!!,"Major issues:- Diameter too small - you have to trim the sandpaper to fit- Too light weight - bounces around- Disc cleaner is not attached - it spins, reducing the effect on the paperOverall a good idea that was poorly engineered."
3,Limited usefulness,"This product works well if you are using a sander by itself, but it is too small if you attach your sander to a vac for dustless sanding. The sander will fall over if the vac hose is attached. I never use mine anymore."
5,Gorgeous,"Within the realm of Robin James' incredibly talented hand, comes a tale of a baby winged horse who may be left behind without mom. For if the young filly cannot fly, she cannot go with her mother back to her homeland. The story has a bittersweet ending, for the stallion known as Nitter-Pitter also has to suffer loss.An amazing tale and beautifully drawn."
5,Primos Goose Call,"Goose call is very easy to use. Easy to blow, Easy to manipulate different calls and tones. Great product. Reccommend to anyone."
1,Good Phyllis Hyman music on terrible-sounding CD.,"This CD's sound quality is simply horrible--when remastering these songs, someone pumped the bass up to the point where it almost drowns out the strings, horns and background vocals entirely! Most of these songs are available on several other Phyllis Hyman CDs (all of which offer much better sound quality) so you really should ignore or pass up this terrible-sounding CD."
1,Not for Teradata DBA,The book is not for DBA at all. I did not get much out of it. They did not talk about the GUI tools provided by Teradata. Just the Teradata SQL syntax and general concepts. The sample they give is more of Teradata 101. I wish I did not get it. It was 162 pages of information that I can get off the web. I read it in 2 days. A very unhappy customer.
1,Bitterly Disappointing,I was bitterly disappointed with this book as I thought it would help my terrier learn to kill on command instead of controlling his number two's. The editor should have given this publication a clearer title to avoid confusion.
2,Dissapointing,I really dont`t know how people can give 5 stars to this book. It`s clear that they don`t know nothing about photography books. It is true that in this book you can see almost all bresson`s photographs but you`ll see many of them in a small size. If I payed 47.25 for this book I expect to receive quality and not a lot of photographies printed in two pages (For me the concept of printing an image in two pages is unacceptable). There isn't a selection of the work in this book. I prefer a book with less photographs but well printed than this book where you have lots of images but in bad print. After spending a lot of money in this book try another of Bresson`s books. Surelly you`ll get better quality for less price.
5,AWESOME SONG,"both the original song and the techno remix are awesome songs... don't understand japanese and i'm not really into japanese pop but this song's really addicting. heard it on 92.7 party, it's a kool song, especially w/ that weird asian twangy instrument goin in the background.good song."
1,Light And Powerful,"The 12 volt impact wrench is perfect for us HVAC technicians. It's light enouigh to carry to rooftops, fast enouigh to move screws fast, and because of impacting capabilities, never too weak to break loose a hard nut or pierce a thick panel.The last one I bought is still in service with an apprentice; it's now 2 years old. Most of my drills haven't been worth beans by the time I replace them, and most are replaced after only a year or so."
5,My favorite earring,Goes with everything. The price was right and the size is perfect. I need to order some more.
5,Happiness in little things,"I bought the 1980 edition of this book at a used bookstore in Leuven sometime in 1987. It was a tough time of my student life, that reading the book was very helpful for me.Until now, I still keep the book in my study and reading it still create a happy moment for me.Thanks Bosmans!!!!Imam SoesenoBogor, Indonesia"
2,Misleading specifications,"I realize some Chinese manufacturers have a different concept of truth in advertising. This knife is supposed to have a ""solid brass"" handle per online description and manufacturer's packaging. I purchased this item as a gift for a friend and when he polished the rough finish he discovered that the handle is a ""pot metal"" alloy with a thin brass colored coating. Although the silver colored handle is probably serviceable it does not look right. If a product specification is not correct I think it would be better not to print it."
2,"1918 ww1 Trench Dagger, sold by Exquisit Gifts","Disappointed in quality. The 1918 U.S. is stenciled not cast with the brass knuckle handle. The Brass knuckle look fake. At closer inspection it is painted brass and not real brass. The blade is some sort of steel but feels flimsy. Don't plan to do battle with this knife. Not good for the world war III. I will sell it at the garage sale and get my money back..... Still looking.\\My product was bought from Amazon.com, Exqusite Gifts, for [...] plus shipping. total investment [...].."
2,Just OK,"This isn't too bad of a quick change chuck, but I have had some problems with mine. I have two dewalt drills and I have one for each and have the same problem with both.First off, the one in the picture is not the one you get. The ones I got were all metal and knurled. (no big deal) The big problem that I have are my bits sometimes fall out when I point the drill down (on both of them). It seems that the ball inside gets stuck and you have to hit it on a hard surface to get it to dislodge. I used a craftsman with a craftsman drill for a long time and had no problems.I still have had good luck with dewalt and will continue to buy their stuff. I suppose maybe I just got a couple of bad ones."
2,Which item is it?,"The pictures show two different products. I was hoping to get the one with orange on it in all pictures but #1. The product is as shown in the first one that for some reason is longer and makes it not as compact. I don't have any tools that can accept the middle section of this product, what is it for? I ended up buying a similar Irwin product that is more compact."
5,One of the best!...,"For the fans of Brian De Palma is necessary... For the other is to discover.... really. The movie stay always one of the best, by the style of directing but also by the subject end the deeper of the story Technical: The film had be filmed in 1981, it's impossible to do a good remastering without some original traces; So, a little grain by moment, but the definition is really augmented and some sequence really more impressive. The final for exemple. The original ratio is protected, it's really a pleasure to rediscover this movies with the entire image. For the sound, the work is also very good, we are more in immersion. So for a movies of 1981 the remastering is perfect. To buy without regret. It's a very good choice... To you to see^^"
3,LIKE GORGING ON COTTON CANDY,"Brian de Palma's unrated Blu-ray version of his lurid, way, way over-the-top 1980 film satisfies on all levels of melodramatic, camp and kitsch. It's the same feeling you get after a night of engorging cotton candy at a midway of peepshows, scary, rickety rides and a sideshow of freaks,.Very Hitchcockian (but without the artistry or subtlety), De Palma's bloody, libidinous fable is built around a mysterious, tall, blonde woman, always hidden behind big sunglasses who murders her shrink's patients and is now after a prostitute witness to the crimes.Michael Caine is Manhattan therapist Dr. Robert Elliot who is terrified at the psychotic killer hunting the women in his life (and with the doc's own stolen straight razor!).Elliot's desperate search to find the murderer before anyone else is hurt catches him in a vortex of deception, deceit and deviance that bridges the gap between innocent sexual fantasies to depraved nightmare. Angie Dickenson and Nancy Allen co-star."
2,Showing its age,Probably decent when released but pretty mild by today's standards. One can see where Angie got her reputation for sex appeal but that was many years ago.
5,A keeper!,"I'm fortunate in that someone very special recognized my interests this year with a generous gift in Stuart Kirkfield's book.Wayne, Elser, Howells and Carmichael's books are all tickled to have this new one sitting amongst them on my shelf. Stuart evidently has forgotten more about building and restoration than many of us will learn. But, thanks to his book we're all better makers due to his efforts.Tight lines,Gerald"
3,Typical Chilton,"This CD-ROM based manual has not improved from the paper-version. I had difficulty finding the correct info for a particular year's model (F150) and the actual component and the illustration in the book did not match. Chilton's products are good for general info only but fall short in covering some of vital info.One thing I was appalled about this CD-ROM set-up is that you can choose only one model and once you decide on a model, other models cannot be accessed in your PC (If you chose F150, the manuals for all other models cannot be accessed). I wouldn't mind this manual to be $100 if it allowed access to all models."
4,Fab Fun from Days gone by,"When I was 10, I had one of these. What a great toy is was for a 10 year old in 1973. It worked great and there was a bit of skill involved. You have to be sure to keep the launcher vertical or you would ding your mother's lamp shade. And of course you cant launch it under the trees unless you really want to go climb a tree. Any way, great memories with this one. It was certainly one of my favorites."
5,Read this book!,"William Browning Spencer writes the type of book, that you pick up for some ""light reading before you go to bed"" and end up reading till 4a.m. Much like its predecessor Zod Wallop it is a very easy read. I found myself dissapointed when I finished because its so hard to find a writer that is so hypnotic so enjoyable. I swear you will read this book in one or two nights. I just wish there were more works by Specer. If your looking for a new author, look no further. Enjoy!"
4,"Monstrously engaging, Résumé is a classic","Between finding time to fill in your timesheets with colored pencils and attending a late night AA meeting that's not overflowing with zombies and ghouls, read Spencer's ""Résumé With Monsters."" What Dilbert did for corporate America in the funny pages, Résumé does with Lovecraft's pantheon of nasties.Though the troubled protagonist is defeatist enough that you don't necessarily care if he wins or loses, the way Spencer slips in the scalpel and peels back the nightmarish absurdity of ""working for the man"" in a world gone crazy is a delight."
3,Jhaeman's Review,"Résumé with Monsters is an interesting and unusual book: a humorous parody of Lovecraft's Cthulu mythos. The main character, Philip Kenan, is a typesetter for various printing companies and believes that various denizens of outer space and other dimensions are personally intervening to destroy his life and career. It's not laugh-out-loud funny in most places, but it is smile-inducing and has great atmosphere."
3,his best book,"If ZOD WALLOP is his worst book, establishing lower bounds of literary incompetence rarely seen even today, Spencer redeems himself with a wild plot that mixes corporate Austin, Texas with Lovecraftian monsters and their semihuman minions. Interesting characters, acceptable writing, genuine humor and satire. I loved the telephone call from the Great Old One that ends the novel."
3,charlie's book,"This book is basically a rehash of many Elvis stories the fans have read in several other well known Elvis books.Charlie Hodge was a close friend and does have some interesting stories but nothing new.What you take away from this book is the same thing you take away from the other books;Elvis was a generous loving man who would do anything for anybody but he faced a giant enemy,himself.GD"
2,A mishmash of drivel,"Please Charlie, did you write this in your lunch hour? Its rubbish. It jumps from one thing to another, it doesnt follow any logical line and gets names wrong (Its DJ Fontana, not JD). Did this guy really know Elvis? If it wasnt for the fact that he appeared on stage (as Charlie says ""he"" was entertaining millions!!) with the King you would doubt it.Gave it two stars for the Elvis pictures but otherwise don't waste your cash. Buy the Enquirer instead, its more entertaining!"
3,Fair product,I have to agree that it is shaky. It is good looking but if you want a stable lectern get something else. It was over priced even with the saving. Company was very good to do business with. I would buy from them again but more careful in choice of product.
4,It is Ok stand,"It is Ok quality piece, for some very light load. It is made of good looking plastic and my only grudge that it is bit shaky. The lock is of good design and the whole piece is highly portable."
5,great biography & history,"Wonderful book! I feel I have not just read Darwin's life but a social history of Victorian England and the emergence of scientists as a new professional class with all its powers & privileges. I just wish there were more on Alfred Wallace and less Huxley. Of the whole cast of Darwinain characters, it seems Wallace is the most generous and admirable. And he raises the question that challenges Darwin and all his sidekicks up to now - consciousness and mind seem a quatumn leap from the evolution of matter and life that natural selection really can't explain them. Unfortunately, he dived off the deep end of spirtiualism and seances."
1,"Does not work, causes break outs",I have very oily skin and acne. I tried to use this to lighten the acne scars. I tried to use this 3 times a day but thats really unrealistic. I was only able to use this twice a day for about a month. I did not see any difference in my skin except I broke out a lot. I stopped using it to see if it had to do with the creme and when I stopped using it my acne subsided. This is not worth your money. I have not been able to find any creme that actually lightens acne scars and sun damage. i did not purchase this from Amazon.
2,Fine for soldering but not torch,"Pros:1. Has a separate on-off switch, easier to turn off, other similar torches usually only have a gas valve.2. This item has good quality of metal finishing.Cons:1. Not good for a torch.2. Hard to light.This item is fine if you are going to use it for soldering, because if you move the torch around an object to heat it, most of the time, the flame will go off, as the other reviewer has stated. (after it goes off, you can still hear the strong hiss of gas flow, so it is not a gas amount problem) This usually won't happen when you solder, because you will hold the pencil with certain angle towards the spot you are soldering. Besides, this item is hard to light, you have to hold your match right at the tip for a while to light, before it is fully ignited you will see the flame goes on and off. Other torches I have, they just take one click of the piezo button to light."
1,Stay away for all costs,"Used maily for soldering. The torch does not have built-in igniter and the re-fulling vent is of a poor quality, it failed after two refillings with ORIGINAL refill kits. It worked for me for a month - it's waste of money. Owned different butane torch that was ""made in China"" that was faaar superior."
4,st200t,"Actually I like this iron. Yes it is also a torch that will blow out easily but I did not buy it for a torch (heat shrink use mainly). I use it for soldering.One thing I must relay, when leaving it on using the built in stand, make sure the exhaust hole near the tip is pointing upwards! I had it pointing downward and it scorched the counter. Lesson learned.I find it solders real well, like the balance compared to other irons where there is more tip then handle. The best thing is no cord to plug in. You will find a happy temperature setting for soldering. This is nice as one can use it for really small soldering projects as well as soldering a larger one."
1,"Won't stay lit, just goes out all the time.","Torch always goes out, especially when you turn it up. When you turn off the red switch, it doesn't immediately turn off. It's barely hot enough to melt silver bearing solder and then the torch flame goes out while gas is still released causing you to restart heating up your parts. Probably better off just using a standard plumbers torch to rock up the heat and have your weld quickly happen."
1,Buy a better one,"As many others have already noted: goes out easily, difficult to light when wanting to use the soldering tip. I probably won't return it to the store, but would never recommend it to anyone."
2,Not very good,"Difficult to light, stay lit, and to refill. I use it a lot for small soldering projects and it's frustrating. Will buy a different one with better quality."
4,Great For soldering if it lasts!,"I bought mine about a year and a half ago at home depot for $10. I mostly used it for soldering, and I solder ccomponents on pcbs. The tip is plenty small for this and it worked great for me, until about 2 weeks ago I accidently got some melted plastic in the end that I can't clean out. I will definitely be buying another one."
1,Useless piece of junk,"I bought this item at a Home Depot thinking it would be a self-lighting butane torch (the packaging does not make the reality very clear).What I got was a little butane spitter that has to be lit with a match. Claims you can use it for soldering (not what I bought it for, but whatever), but in that case, why not just get a real soldering iron? Cheaper and it wouldn't use up butane.Summary:- Runs out of fuel very quickly- Not self-lighting- There are better torches out thereDon't buy this as a butane torch. Don't buy it as a soldering iron, either. In fact, just don't buy it. You'll regret it if you do."
3,Wrong Item,"Great Company to order from, Fast delivery. I received something different than the picture showed to no fault of anyone's. The original Item is discontinued. The Company made it right by me right away the next day. The torch itself does not stay lite if tiled or held certain ways. Not happy with the torch. But very happy with the Company I ordered from. Thanks Guys."
1,"DO NOt BUY, IMPOSSIBLE TO LIGHT","This is 100% junk. I did manage to get it lit once. The instructions say ""light the torch through the oval hole and then release the adapter to cover the burner""How about, ""light the torch through the oval hole, release the adapter, note that the torch goes out. Repeat as required (spend a half hour or so) to get it lit. What a piece of garbage."
3,soundtrack for your life,"as Wallpaper* said: Brian Eno's 70's invention of Ambient Music was intended to work as soundtracks for living. No distracting lyrics and arrangements, this is the perfect stuff for lounging about on a late sunday afternoon, or your drive down Market Street... if you're the wired kind who works surrounded by whirring, buzzing server hard drives, this thing will set you free while still allowing you to concentrate on watching the ax."
2,THIS BOOK NEEDS SOME ADDITIONAL MATERIAL AND WORK,"I RECEIVED THIS BOOK FROM THE ASQ, AND I AM CONSIDERING RETURNING IT. WRITTEN FOR A PERSON WITH SOME EXPERERIENCE, THE BOOK NEEDS A LITTLE MORE WORK. FOR EXAMPLE: PAGE 4 LISTS GAMMA FUNCTIONS VERSES N. THERE IS NO DEFINITION OF N. ON PAGE 6 NEITHER EXAMPLE SHOWS HOW THE GAMMA FUNCTION WAS OBTAINED. WORKING THE EXAMPLE BACKWARDS REVEALS A GAMMA FUNCTION THAT IS NOT IN THE TABLE ON PAGE 4. THE SOFTWARE IS A DOS BASED PROGRAM. VIRTUALLY EVERYONE TODAY IS RUNNING WIN95 OR NT OR MAC. SUGGEST THE SOFTWARE BE UPDATED FOR THE TIMES."
1,Unhappy Buyer,"I purchased this cordless phone on 11/27/2005 online. When it arrived I read the insturction manual, then let the battery charge for the 10 hours it recommended. When it was fully charged I tried to use the phone, handset would not communicate with the base unit.Returned for exchange, new phone worked well on out going calls, but incomming call's could not communicate with handset.The sound quality was less than great, awnsering system was of very poor sound quality, all in all just a poor quality system. Returned and exchanged for a Panasonic KX-TG2431W"
4,great album from a longtime fan.,"As a fan of Billy Ray's since the Glory days of 1992, I looked forward to SOuthern RAin as his new start, his debut on a new label. What I got was a great album. The title track is the best song on the album and should have been a bigger hit than number 40. Hey Elvis is a great rock track that's fun and let's the listener know why Billy Ray and sly Dog should be left alone to make their music the way they want to. Great. We the People and Burn Down the Trailor Park are just as cool. The downside is there are just too many ballads I will, Everywhere I want to be I could have done without. Crazy bout you Baby doesn't really do anything either, but that's my opinion, give it a try and discover this album."
5,"A DVD tribute to Charlton Heston, the star of over sixty movies","Janson Media's ""Hollywood Collection"" series now includes a DVD tribute to Charlton Heston, the star of over sixty movies. Charlton Heston For All Seasons pays homage to Heston's many roles, from king to slave and hero to villain, in classic Hollywood films such as ""Moses"", ""Ben-Hur"", ""El Cid"" and ""Michelangelo. Also revealed is the aspect of his personality that led him to speak out on the issues he believed in, regardless of their controversy. Highlights from some of Heston's most well-known movies intersperse this respectful homage, enhanced with extra features including a photo gallery, an interview with Gene Feldman, and a ""meet the producers"" segment. 85 min., color with some black-and-white footage of classic films."
5,Cant lose with these Dreams,"Having been a DA fan going back to ""Northen Town"" days and the INCREDIBLE ""Power to Believe"" it was wayyyy past time to give another LP a go. As I suspected ,haunting lyrics and vocals bring you back to that small industrial town ,forever overcast with clouds ,damp and beautiful . You wont be dissapointed ,as long as the feel of being where I just described makes you want to be there on occasion .If not , you might think it sucks chunky gravy .Nanny nanny boo boo ."
2,After 2 years of office use,"Our office purchased this shredder in Feb 2007. In May 2009 it's dead. So we got 2 years of use out of it. We have 13 employees which produce around a ream a week of shredding. The power does slow down considerably when shredding more than a sheet at a time, and it does seem like it will just quit sometimes. Ours now makes a loud noise when you turn it on (maybe due to the other reviewer's findings of keeping it unplugged. We never have unplugged it). It's an ok shredder, but not really a ""heavy duty."" Would not buy again."
4,It works,"I've only had this shredder for a couple of days, but so far, it seems to do a decent job for exactly what we bought it for: shredding financial paperwork. Credit card offers, etc. get tossed in without being opened, and get chewed up easily. I tried a CD that has hanging around and that got chewed up, but some shards were left behind on the top of the unit.I ended up buying it at a local club. This is our first shredder, so I'm not comparing it to anything else, just what I bought it for, and what it does.FWIW, I did lubricate the teeth first thing with some mineral oil."
1,A Heavyweight Wimp,"We had this machine for 2 years and it finally died. We shred less than 1/2 ream of paper a week, so I would consider the useage as light/medium duty. The shredder is a beast, it weighs about 30 pounds and takes up a fair amount of space. However, anything more than 4 sheets bogs the motor so badly that you start praying it will make it through without stopping. In addition, the shredded bits end up gathering on the sides of the motor, which no doubt contribute to the load. I think this shredder is poorly designed and am very happy with the Fellowes PS 12 I bought to replace it. It's twice as powerful with half the weight and half the space, plus at a lower price!"
1,please read the fine print before you purchase,"Hidden withing the instructions, they tell you to keep this unplugged unless it is in use. How inconvenient is that? I used this about 3 times before it was totally unusable. Guess the fact it was plugged in, it got fried by a power surge. Completely useless. It is headed for the curbside trash."
1,Reprint is flawed,"This book is not the original. It is a restrike and it shows.The font is broken in too many places, the print is small and the typos are too frequent to count. I suspect the real version reads more easily, but this is a struggle."
4,It kicks more ass than the terminator on steroids,I cant think of that much to say about the music since it really speaks for itself
5,full length?,awesome CD -- anyone know of a bootleg of the video version? stinks that the CD removed breathe and the land of rape and honey that the vhs version included. especially breathe - the dual drumming intro is bar-none the best start of a concert I've ever seen to really get the blood flowing.
4,A strong voice.....,"a friend hipped me to Alison, so i went to the website. i wasnt THAT impressed but later bought it at a local record store. afterREALLY listening to it, i became impressed!! the sister has a great voice and her lyrics are hot! i cant get enough of SAVE ME!it feels good to hear live instruments played the way they are on this song!! my favorites1.Save Me2.Like Rain3.Oil & Water4.Nappy5.Crossroadsthe only negative is the remake of the Janet Jackson song When I Think of You. other than that the album is hot!"
4,Alive!,"Alison Crockett cd is very smooth, and refreshing without sounding repetitive. It is needed more in the music industry. I am a happy consumer with Alison's CD. The musicians are superb! Alison's background arrangements are on point with a twist of past. Alison's flexible vocals are indeed a pleasure. I can think of many artist when hearing her voice. She does not sound like one. She has similiar sounds to Carleen Anderson, Ledisi, Brand New Heavy to her own unique sound. Alison's voice with the funky soulful british vibe is a nice & delicate combination."
4,decent,product as advertised. b+. get what you pay for--very flimsy but gets the job done. I would buy this again.
3,smaller than it looks,I really like the design with the molded handle and fixed metal base. But it's actually kinda tiny. two words
1,Don wate your money!,"I was not expeting top of the line hand pump but neighter a un-usable hand pump, first time i try with my 4 year old bike the nuzzle came off."
3,Its ok.,"For bicycle tires, this is what it,s made for. i was looking for something to air up a atv tire. for the price this is ok, it will do the job, for a atv tire, you might want to buy one thats a little more heavy duty."
4,Gorgeous eyes!,I love the Sultry Sapphire! It's easy to apply if you're careful and makes the smokey look so much easier to do. There's a revlon video on how to apply at you tube.
1,Not a great eyeliner,"I got this to go with the Just Bitten plum wicked lip stain. The colors look nice together, but this powder eyeliner is difficult to apply. When it touches your lashes it flakes all over your face. It did last overnight though. I wouldn't buy it again."
1,"Not a kid, just too lazy to create an account.","When I saw this, I thought it would be a convent way to fix my make-up throughout the day. Now I wish I could take it back, I only used this product once, but regretted it. It smeared constantly, after laughing, it looked like I was crying black, and was difficult to take off. It would not shade in the way I wanted it to, I would have been better off just using eyeliner."
5,My first favorite!,"I've tried many colognes (Hugo Boss, Dolce & Gabbana, Jon Varvatos), but there is something more extraordinary about LE MALE! This fragrance has many layers to it. It starts off with the musky aspect, but then it shows you it's fresh, floral and even citrusy aspect. Women love it, and have commented on wanting to know it's name! It's a stand out from the run of the mill Aqua Di Gios, and Black Codes that everyone and their brother seems to like. It has a unique bottle to say the least, but give it a try!!!! It'll become your new favorite!"
3,"Nice looking, not for high traffic.","This piece was exactly the look I was going for but the first one I ordered arrived broken, cast iron piece snapped clean. They quickly sent a replacement, and after being in place for 3 months, another area snapped off. It is now not functional. I use the gate every day, if this was a side gate that was rarely used it would probably be ok."
5,worth the price,"I bought this after hitting a deer on the highway and nocking off the o.e.m. mirror. The entire job from start to finish was less than 20 mins including removing the old mirror remnants. Three simple nuts on the inside and the old unit came off with a little hand prying to break the weather stripping seal. Other than the tweeter speaker being in the way of getting a socket wrench in there, it was super simple. The wire plug fit perfectly into the existing harness and operates motor control perfectly. Only comment is the mirror glass itself does vibrate a little at high speed so they may have skimped on the mounting of the pane but this is a fraction of the OEM part from the dealer and I bought on Saturday night (late) and had it on my doorstep Wednesday. Cant complain and would buy again in an instant, but hopefully wont have to."
3,Fine mirror,"The mirror itself is fine. I happen to buy these a lot as I live on a small city street and my mirrors don't happen to last long. However, the power cable that I received with the mirror did not fit the power cable in my 98 Camry. I have never had this happen the other times I've purchased these."
4,You don't have to be a Trekkie to enjoy it...,"...but if you are a Star Trek fan, you simply have to hear it! I'm not much into synth-pop but I do find S.P.O.C.K, well... fascinating. They have a fun theme, and more important, a good sound. This CD is my personal favorite by the Swedish band. Included are some of their better songs: ""Never Trust a Klingon"", ""Mr. Spock's Brain"", ""The Last Man on Earth"". For the Trekkie (or anyone) who enjoys synth, ""Five Years Mission"" is a good launching pad to begin your S.P.O.C.K. experience."
4,"AN UPDATED ""CHARLIE'S ANGELS"" THEME SONG!",Great work from apollo 440! his previous works with U2 and Lost in Space are outstanding. I hope to see a video of the theme song!
3,Just rented the movie...,"and liked it as much as when I saw it in the theater. And everyone is right - the CD is missing too many of the songs.FYI- the first ""Angel"" song is Juice Newton singing ""Angel of the Morning"" from 1981. They shoulda included it on the soundtrack... oh well..."
2,"Nothing much to offer, so get singles instead","I don't think this album do any good for Charlie's Angels fans'. The only song that deserves the top notch would be Independent Women. Others such as True is a nice song but it has been too commercialised, one, if you can still remember 'The Wedding Singer'.Although, the soundtrack does have few notable singers such as Aerosmith, Fatboy Slim or Marvin Gaye, it does no good since they are nothing new in soundtrack compilations.The only favourite here is Destiny's Child, Independent Women thus, I suggest that if you are a fan(either both), go and get the CD singles instead. It would be worthwhile to get the remix!!"
3,more missing tracks,"I think the soundtrack has a lot to recommend it, but the tracks that were left off are in many cases better than the ones that were included (or at least as worthy). Perhaps a double album should have been considered. Anyway, continuing the thread below, another track that was left off was:Live Wire - Motley Crue (towards the end on the helicopter, I think)"
3,One song,"the only reason i would ever think of buying this cd is for 1 song, the one that is played at the part with drew barymore tied up, it might be the 'bad guy' theme or something, can anyone help me out? is it on the cd? whats the name? who did it?thanks in advance"
4,A spur of the moment purchase that I actually don't regret!,"In an effort to spoil myself rotten on my birthday I scooped up several different motion picture soundtracks, this one included. While I enjoyed the movie, and I felt the music was upbeat, it did not have the greatest impact on me when compared to all the other eye-candy that Charlie's Angels had to offer. But I remembered liking it, so I added it to my basket- which usually leaves me with feelings of regret after I've opened it, but I was pleasingly suprised. I knew all the songs from the past and current radio play, but I found that the mix of them all together was pleasing and upbeat. I played the CD during my birthday party and got a positive reaction, not only from questioning and compliments, but also observing my friends unconciously dancing and singing along."
2,Where is the metal?,"I wanted this CD after I saw the movie because of the more metal-y songs. Prodigy's ""Smack my Bitch Up"" is not on the CD, and neither is Motley Crue's ""Live Wire"". There were a few other songs of that genre that I could not identify, but were the reason I'd buy this CD. Now, I'm not gonna get it . . ."
4,I need a track which this soundtrack does not include,"*spoiler included, sort of, do not read on if you haven't seen the movie*Hello all,First of all, the soundtrack rocks, and so does the movie, but there is one track which is not included on the OST which is in the movie (It is not the Prodigy's Breathe, however cool that is)The moment is when Eric Knox (Sam Rockwell) has Dylan (Drew Barrymore), captured in his hilltop fortress/castle type thing.He flicks a switch on his stereo, and a cool, funky tune starts playing, which he then moonwalks and break dances to.Please could anyone who knows what this track is, post something below my message.Thanks"
3,"Nothing amazing, but still good.","This is pretty much your typical soundtrack. It's got a few film-related songs, and then just a random selection of old and new. Highlights are from ""Destiny's Child"", ""Heart"", ""The Vapors"", and ""Deee-lite"". Of course most of the rest is good too, if you can stand to hear ""Baby Got Back"" one more time. I seem to remember a ""Korn"" song in the movie, but I guess that didn't quite fit in here. The sequel's soundtrack is decent too, but overall this one is better. Where else are you gonna hear ""Tom Green"" singing?"
4,Charlie's Angels~,"I've read some reviews here saying that this CD is bad. But that is not true. This CD has some bad songs and some very good songs. However, if you buy this CD your really taking a chance. The songs are ""old"" but they have good beats and some have nice lyrics. Probably the only reason that most of you bought this CD is for the Destiny's Child song(s). Good but the rest are good too!!"
3,Name of that song people are looking for.,"I found this posted in the reviews awhile ago (so I do not take credit for this)""For all of those interested, the song playing in Knox's lair is Simon Says by Pharoahe Monch.""You'll want to find the instrumental version of the song, thats the one they use in the movie.If you dont like listening to explicit lyric songs, definately dont get the regular version of the song."
4,Missing Song,"I believe the song that is missing that people are looking for is ""Breathe"" by Prodigy on their ""the Fat of the Land"" cd. It is played in both movies. Hope that helps."
3,song question pleez,Can someone tell me the song they play when Eric Knoxx does his dance in his secret base and a few moments Drew Barrymore appears to stop him.
3,To Cheez,Look bud-dy ! I too came on this site cause i'm tryin' to figure out the same song. If I remember or find out ... I'll be sure to tell you. I just don't understand how a song that great doesn't end up on the soundtrack!
1,name of instrumental,i REALLLY REALLY REALLY wanna know the name of the instrumental piece playing when drew barrymore enters the mexican bar where she meets jaclyn smith. somebody help me please!
3,Fatboy slims music,"I would like to know the music from the movie, when natalie went head to head with the ""Slim no talking bad guy"".... Right when he put him over the bridge there was music going, what is the title to that song. I have an idea is by Fatboy slim, but if anyone knows please E-Mail me at Juandfl1@aol.com Thank you."
4,Whats that song....,"This soundtrack is quite good, although there was one song that I was REALLY disappointed that was not on the album. The song that is played in the tower when Noxx is dancing by himself. Its a hiphop song, but it never seemed to make it on this album. If you know what song this is, please let me know."
3,where's the good music?,"I saw the movie last night, and there's tons of sweet music throughout the movie. However when i got the cd, i was really disappointed with the selections that chose to put on the soundtrack. A lot of the best songs were left off. It is still an ok soundtrack, but after the movie, i had really high-hopes."
3,Help with song title or artist,Hi i was expecting a song on the soundtrack and unfortunately it wasn't on it. The song is that japanese sounding song from the party. Can anybody tell me what's the artist and/or title of the song? Thanks
3,"love the movie, leave the soundtrack","Well, I loved this movie, but I would have never bought the soundtrack for myself. Still, it was an enjoyable first listen. Several songs on here are great groovin' type songs. (Tracks #2, #3, Fatboy Slim, and even the great jazzed-up Charlie's Angels theme song.) There are also a couple songs I wouldn't want to listen to more than a couple times. (Destiny's Child ""Dot"" is ridiculous, ""True"" is incredibly long and boring, Aerosmith's contribution is almost painful, and there are several others that were only in the movie for a few-second cut -for good reason.) There are no songs on here I love, but at least it brought scenes from the movie fondly back to mind."
1,Waste of money,"The soundtrack has got some classics like Groove Is in The Heart and a pretty good remix of the Angels' theme, but that's about all. The new Aerosmith song is horrible and the song by Destiny Child is being played to death on the radio and on MTV/VH1. All the great music you thought you would hear from the action scenes are not in the soundtrack; instead, we get tired-out top 40 songs like Turning Japanese and Baby Got Back. If you feel like being silly and listen to has-been songs, you can get much better compilation albums for cheaper price. This is an album you would listent to once, maybe twice, and would forever thereafter gather dust on your shelf."
3,Not Quite What I Expected,"While watching the movie I could not get over how much the high-impact dance music energized the audience and I. The soundtrack doesnt cover what I consider to be some of the highlights of the movie. The entire closing number (All The Small Things by Blink182) is missing, along with the music that accompanied the awesome action scenes. Although the music is good, dont get me wrong, it doesnt sample the movie as well as I thought a soundtrack would. The movie itself though had the best music of any movie I have ever seen, and is definately worth the ($...) i had to pay to get in."
4,Makes me feel good right down to my toes,"The movie was incredibly cute and fun, and the soundtrack is great as well. It's an ideal blend of music from several different decades, the 70's, 80's, 90's, and the new mellinium. My favorite songs are Leo Sayer's ""You Make Me Feel Like Dancing"" (makes me want to dance too!); Marvin Gaye's ""Got To Give It Up"" is the classic groove song, it's very smooth; of course Deee-Lite's ""Groove Is In The Heart""; Fatboy Slim's ""Ya Mama"" is surprisingly good. Songs like ""Baracuda"" and ""Baby Got Back"" aren't the greatest, but they remind you of moments in the film and you end up laughing and it sparks some conversation."
3,Dot - Destiny's child is great!,"I love that track, its not in the movie, but its still nice.To that reviewer wanting to know what that song is called, it is called got to give it up, be aaliyah."
3,BECKY CHILDERS,"I LOVED THE MOVIE AND WAS VERY EXCITED WHEN I WENT TO PURCHASE THE CD SOUNDTRACK. AFTER LISTENING TO IT I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. THERE ARE 2 SONGS THAT WERE ON THE MOVIE THAT WERE NOT ON THE CD. ONE OF THEM WAS ""UNDERCOVER ANGLE"" AND I DON'T KNOW THE NAME TO THE OTHER ONE, BUT THE SCENE THAT IT PLAYED ON WAS AT THE VERY END OF THE MOVIE WHEN THE ANGLES WERE WASHED UP TO SHORE AND WERE HEADED TO CHARLIES CABIN, I THINK THAT ROD STEWART SINGS IT THE SONG SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT ANGLES RESCUEING ME. I WOULD LIKE TO GET THOSE OTHER TWO SONGS."
3,Starts out great...,"With another great song by Destiny's Child (who can get enough of them these days) to open the track listing, one only listens to the rest of the songs with a twinge of dissapointment. I enjoyed the new spin on the old Charlie's Angels theme song. The CD is still worthy of a space in any soundtrack collection."
4,los angeles musicales,"es excelente la seleccion de temas usados en el film, rescatando joyas como ""barracuda"" entre otras. lamento que no se incluyera en el cd la version de ""angel"" por rod stewart y algunas otras buenas canciones que se escuchan a lo largo de la pelicula."
2,just fun,"have fun with this soundtrack?. Do you like this album?. if you say yes, i'm sad with that. this album pure waste my time and my money!. there are too many poor songs [classic songs and also modern songs] in this album which absolutely just funny song. but, beside of that, this album still has small-box of energy to make us smile. for the small-box of energy and hard editing, i give this album 2 stars."
3,Where's the music from the movie?,"Loved the movie and the music in it...was hoping it'd be on the soundtrack. The hard core songs are missing...but what's left is still fun. Marvin Gaye, Sir Mix A Lot, Fatboy Slim and others make this worht listening. The Matrix soundtrack is full of the style of missing music from this one...would be a good companion."
5,Charlie's Angels,This is an awesome soundtrack. It is fun and enjoyable to listen to. The best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do
3,Song Help,"Does anyone know the name of the song where in the scene, natalie and her bartender date go to soul train, the beginning of the scene, a songs starts with a ""do me baby""? I can't find who sings it cause I don't have any lyrics of it except for the ""do me baby"" part. Thanks in advance to those can help!"
4,Looking for Song,"I just want to know what the song is when they wash up on the beach at the end, somehting about ""angel came down from heaven"" i recognize the singers voice but I cant place the name.Note: After buying this soundtrack ""Heaven Must be Missing an Angel"" is now the #1 played song on my iPod, by alot!!"
3,More gap filling......,"Here's the list of additional songs to the soundtrack I've managed to identify so far:Come On Baby Tell Me - Low Fidelity All StarsTwiggy Twiggy/Twiggy Vs. James Bond - Pizzicato Five (japanese song at party)Smack My Bitch Up - The Prodigy (alley fight scene)Song 2 - Blur (Dylan kicks ass!)Blind - Korn (start of movie)All The Small Things - Blink 182 (end credits)Money, That's What I Want - Flying Lizards (Natalie character intro)I Love Rock And Roll - Joan Jett (I think it's this - Dylan character intro)Simon Says - Pharoah Monch (Knox dancing)Hope this helps...please add anymore you know.Cheers ;-)"
2,Where the heck is the rest of the music?,"I thought the movie has one of the very best soundtracks ever, hands down. But the CD is missing about half of the songs from the darn movie?! I was really dissapointed. BOO SONY!"
5,Add this CD to your collection,"This soundtrack has many good songs both new and old. Every song on this CD is a winner. The 2 new songs by Destiny's Child are great. Independent Woman fits the theme of the movie perfectly. This CD features songs I haven't heard in years. I particularly liked Groove is in the Heart from the early 90s. You Make Feel Like Dancing from the mid 70s. I loved the dance classics Heaven Must be Missing an Angel, and Got to Give It Up from early 70s. I loved the songs True and Turning Japanese from the early 80s. Add this great soundtrack to your collection."
3,Where's the music from the movie?,"Loved the movie and loved the hard core songs from the action scenes. Ran from the movie to get the CD...and wondered where the songs were?! Charlie's Angels 2000 is an awesome update and the last song is fun & funky. Recognized the ""missing"" songs from the Matrix soundtrack...would go nicely with this CD. Overall enjoyable...but not what I expected/hoped."
2,Soundtrack 2 - Soundtrack 3,"Unless they plan on releasing second and third prints of this soundtrack I expect to see bootlegs showing up on ebay any day. I'd prefer to buy them from the source for quality reasons, but if the studio that released this movie thinks the songs they've put on this CD are enough for the fans of this movie, they are mistaken. Someone should post a complete song list from the credits somewhere. I stopped counting after 30 songs listed in the credits."
2,The best song in the movie is missing,"How come ""Blind"" by Korn was played partially two times during the movie yet it isn't on the soundtrack? That's a shame, cause it's the only good song in the entire movie."
5,missling link,another to add to the list is fatboyslim's push the tempo playing during the helicopter chase towards the end. does anyone know what the disco track is that knox dances to before betraying dylan? i'd love to get hold of it.ta
2,Buford Pusser Legacy,I must say up front that I got this movie for the 'Real American Hero' movie about Buford Pusser because I was a fan of the origional Walking Tall movie and had read several books about Buford Pusser. This is not a bad movie but it is really not a great movie. It isn't bad but it uses the character of Buford Pusser and the rural setting for a pretty much fictional story. Brian Denehy does an ok job as does Ken Howard as the heel but it doesn't stand up to Joe Don Baker in the origional flick. Not even sure it is as good as Walking Tall II or Final Chapter Walking Tall. But it is certainly better than the movie Walking Tall with The Rock.I haven't watched True Blood yet so I really can't comment on it.
2,It says it covers Ford trucks 1986-200 but it doesn't,"I guess it would be okay if it covered what I expected. I have a 2000 Explorer and based on the title, that is what I thought I was getting. It covers up to 1999 Explorers. Maybe only a slight difference, but who knows. I started to install it, but at the beginning you have to select the vehicle you want and if wrong, there are additional fees. Chilton is a respected name but I feel I've been bait and switched. I do not blame the shipper, They probably thought as I did regarding years covered."
1,Little Information,I bougt this as a gift for my spouse who was going to replace the heater core on the F150. There was very little procedural information. Youtube videos were actually more helpful.
3,chilton cd rom,Better than the owners manual alone. Would be nice if it ran on vista or win7 machines. I have to run on my kids xp machine.
2,Basic info,"This is basic information,if you are looking for in depth procedures or any technical info, buy something else. The chapter on automatic transmission is about three pages long, unbolt transmission and take to shop.... Once you load the cd, you are asked for which model you want, once you do that you can only retrieve that info... no other models.... I will never buy another Chilton cd. The owners manual in the glove box has more info..."
4,An undiscovered gem,"Long before Whitney Houston recorded Dolly Parton's ""I Will Always Love You"" Bettye Swann was recording songs like ""Today I Started Loving You Again"" and ""Sweet Dreams"" bluring the lines between Nashville country and Memphis soul.This album is highly recommended!"
5,Bettye Swann - Quite possibly the greatest R&B soul singer to ever grace our fine planet.,"I have never listened to Bettye Swann sing a song that I didn't think was better than, or at least as good as, any other interpretation of that song or genre in existence. It sounds too good to be true, but man, don't let it pass you by. You'll be in on the secret if you pick up this truly life-changing Astralwerks release. No, seriously though. She's unbelievable. My favorite songs are ""I'm Lonely for You,"" ""Willie and Laura Mae,"" and ""Stand By Your Man,"" although it's a tough call since they are all so incredible that it will blow your mind. Yes, mind-blowing; that's Bettye!"
2,Well below expectation,I started reading this book and I really liked it at the beginning. It was clear and very simple. After some chapters it become a little confuse and then... half the book is used to tell authors esperiences and benchmark data that don't teach much to you. On the other hand the software that is included to practice forecasting techniques doesn't works in the way the book tells (it's a mess).Really I enjoy only the first half of the book.
3,A Good Book: Well Worth The Small Price,"I was hoping to find a good book on the techniques of biofeedback, but the problem when you buy books without being able to see inside them and read a little of them, is that you never quite know what you're getting unless there's a review.Well, before now there was no review and I bought this book, ""blind."" It turned out to be not a bad book, but not very helpful as far as actual biofeedback techniques go. Rather, the author Ann E. Weiss takes a detailed look into the history of biofeedback starting back in the late '60s on into the decade that followed. This is a fascinating look into what biofeedback can do to help alleviate several problems from arthritis to migraines and more.Okay, it doesn't have much in the way of biofeedback techniques, yet the book is worth reading if you have any kind of interest in biofeedback. It's very well written and reads well, and it's the perfect introduction to biofeedback.Orion"
5,No Bah Humbug!,"This is Victorian music at its finest. If you want to explore some magnificent old carols and gorgeous vocal arrangements, then buy this. If you want to be transported back to the time and place of Charles Dickens, then buy this. If you want to hear Let It Snow! Let It Snow! and Frosty the Snowman, then don't buy this. The Revels have five quality Christmas CDs, and this is the best one."
2,Not as pictured!,"I just bought this ripstik for my soon to be 11 year old daughter. I thought it was just plain blue, but it actually has strange little characters all over it that you can't see online. I was also hoping it would be smaller. I have seen kids in our neighborhood with smaller ripstiks and I thought this was it. The name implies that it would be a smaller size. It doesn't appear to be any smaller than the big ones to me. I'm debating whether to return it???"
5,Sergio Leone westerns - book,Got my product in a timely fashion and I have no complaints. This is a gorgeous book; must-have item! - JB
3,Everything has a price...,"First, they look great and the price is right. I have ordered 4 pair with different teams represented. It really does not matter if this is your home town or not. With that said, there are probably a few teams that would not interest me in wearing. The problem is related to the back of the show above the heal. In all of the pairs purchased they wore through the fabric and cracked. The rest of the shoe looked great but you start getting skin issues due to the plastic cracking and rubbing. Too bad, in the short run you can wear them to that point and not be out serious cash."
3,Stylish & Stains,These stone coasters are really cool and the Frank Lloyd Wright design is impeccable. I'm afraid they won't see much use as they are easily stained. They'll be great for anything that doesn't stain.
4,"The facts about ""Catch Me If You Can""","For those of you comparing the literary qualities of this book with ""Catch Me If You Can"", note that Abagnale did not write that book. He only told his story to the real writer. You can read Abagnale's comments about this at his website at http://www.abagnale.com/comments.htm.Having said that, I will say that Abagnale has plentiful good advice about taking precautionary steps to protect yourself from fraud. If you don't feel sufficiently informed on that subject, this book is an eye-opening source of information about the threats and the steps you can take to protect yourself.Abagnale's grasp of complex computer security topics isn't very strong. But that is a fast-changing subject that might be better researched online than in books, which are necessarily a bit behind the times."
3,Art of the Steal,THERE WERE A COUPLE OF BAD SPOTS ON THE AUDIO OF THE CD. THAT MADE IT JUMP OTHER THEM THAT IT WAS OK
4,the art of the steal,This book is very easy to read and it points out security that is helpful on a daily basis for our home
4,Common Sense that's Not so Common,"Abagnale offers some insight into the mind, motives, and methods of many criminals. As I read through the The Art of the Steal, I found that many of Mr. Abagnale's suggestions were useful, some were common sense, and a few were just fluff to fill up the pages of a book. I liked the format because the chapters are broken down into logical (and small) segments that provide excellent reading material for the bus, train, or in a waiting room. I found the details of the scams described in the book absolutely fascinating. The real question that you need to ask yourself after reading a book like this is : Do I feel that I am better prepared to prevent fraud for having read this book? My answer to this question is, Yes. I am buying an extra copy of this book for my neice who is a bank teller, and I would recommend it to those in management, those running a private business, or anyone who supervises employees that handle money (or cash equivalents)."
4,Essential for business owners!,"The Art of the Steal is a real eye-opener for anyone who owns or manages a small business. Abagnale's case histories of embezzlement and fraud reveal common scams and cons. I was wide-eyed, recognizing people and opportunities he described. That said, it is almost a ""How to become a thief"" instruction book.The weakest parts of the book are the sections on Identity theft and interrnet fraud; possibly because I already felt familiar with those subjects. But the business, credential and ATM & check fraud sections make this book a bargain. I will not look at checks and business accountiing in the same way in the future.I highly recommend this book."
3,Work fine but ridiculously expensive,The price on these sanding belts seems crazy. They probably don't cost even $2 to make in china and sell for nearly $10 each here. Luckily I do not go through to many...
3,Superwoman II,"Karyn White's second album, ""Ritual Of Love,"" is a decent follow-up to her self-titled debut. Its lead single, ""Romantic,"" stormed the charts as high as no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. Eventual singles such as ""The Way I Feel About You,"" and ""Walkin' The Dog,"" didn't match the success of ""Romantic."" The ballads that best showcase her vocal prowess are ""Do Unto Me,"" ""One Heart,"" and ""Tears of Joy."" Noticeably absent are L.A. and Babyface, who worked on her debut album eventually delivering 3 no.1 hits. Nonetheless a decent sophomore project by Ms. Superwoman..."
4,"Slinky, sexy followup. . . .","Though ""Ritual of Love,"" Karyn White's follow-up to her self-titled debut has a few tracks that are obvious filler, her slinky, sexy charm is still more than enough to satisfy. White's voice can be as slinky as Diana Ross' or as kittenish as Janet Jackson's purr, yet White's is much more thrilling and muscular, her vocal gymnastics obviously influenced by the likes of Babyface and Michael Jackson when he was in his prime. With equal aplomb, she easily handles crunching dance tunes (""Romantic"" [the only hit here that ranks with ""The Way You Love Me,"" ""Superwoman"" or ""Love Saw It"" from her debut album], ""Ritual of Love"" and ""Walking the Dog"") and sultry Babyface-inspired ballads (""Hard to Say Goodbye,"" ""How I Want You,"" ""One Heart""). ""Ritual of Love"" may not be letter perfect but it's still great enough to make you wish that Karyn White had not decided to abruptly end what was--and would surely have continued to be--a successful recording career."
4,One of the 90s Best,"Karyn White didn't have an amazing voice (it was different and soulful), but she had personality and the ability to reach young and old fans with her music. Unlike artists of today, she didn't use her sexuality to sell records. Instead (along with her powerhouse producers) she crafted some of the best 90s R&B;/Pop music of that era and this album reflects that.I was only a pup when this album came out and it took me a while to dig this album because I expected Terry Lewis to give his wife a more R&B; dance sound. However, I have grown to respect this album... Its a woman's album and her take on love."
3,it's alright,"Don't get me wrong, I love karyn white's voice, but I was disappointed because this cd only had 3 songs I really liked.It was au-right, I guess. I have mixed feelings. It wasn't great but it wasn't bad.What ever happened to her, she just has a singing voice that soft and sensual. There aren't many these days,who have that ol'skool vibe going."
2,Still Disappointing,"Karyn White's self-titled debut was a nice mixture of slow jams and upbeat R&B/dance fare, thanks to ace production team LA & Babyface. Somewhere between that album and RITUAL OF LOVE, something apparently got lost, though I'm still not quite sure what. White remained an appealing vocalist, and lead single 'Romantic' was a winner from the word go, but the rest of the disc sounds alot like Janet Jackson cast-offs(the presence of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis would attest to this, though you would think Lewis(White's husband)would do better by his wife). 'The Way You Make Me Feel' is indicative of what you'll find here--generic, faceless R&B. A disappointing effort from someone who seemed to be capable of much better."
2,Very Average,I dig Jam&Lewis alot.they are two of the Greatest Producers ever.but Material Like this Brings them down to Earth Quickly.Romantic was the jam Trademark Jam&Lewis but Most of The Material is 2nd-tier Material.While Jam&Lewis Use the same Formula Alot WHite Sounds Like A 2nd-tier Jody Watley.Both Instances Missing the Real Thing.
5,This Mortal Coil,"Enter the young male prostitute, performance artist, author, street monger, and angry prophet. He was all of these things and more until AIDS finally claimed him. But with Close to the Knives, he has left us all a very precious legacy--a frame of reference that begs us to truly witness the politics of suffering in American society and become more compassionate in the process. His omnivorous approach to our culture is dizzying, enraging, mysterious, beautiful, dangerous, heartbreaking, and very very necessary. When I finished reading it, I turned it over and started again. I will never be the same.....I have been galvanized."
5,A Masterpiece: More Timely Than Ever,"CLOSE TO THE KNIVES is simply one of the most important books ever written by one of the most brilliant creative minds of the era. This is an AMAZING, STUNNING and thoroughly SUPERB collage of essays surrounding Mr. Wojnarowicz's battle with HIV, dealing with the politics and bureaucracy of the disease, justice, history, the ranking of lives as ""important"" and ""unimportant"" by the powers that be, and life in general. FIERCE, POETIC, and INSIGHTFUL these pieces compose a whole that packs an awesome whollop and is nothing short of GENIUS. This book lights fires and breaths fire with the energy of the words literally screaming from the page at points. CLOSE TO THE KNIVES is also sad proof of yet another life lost before it's time due to the AIDS pandemic. It is a call to action with a message that has not dimmed one iota since it's writing. More timely and pertinent than ever."
1,The Rude Awakening of a Sophomore,Close to the Knives is an extremely explicit book on homosexual reations that include very violent behavior. It is about a man who is a prostitute and sells himself to make money. One should know before reading it that it is a pornagraphic book that pushes another life style on others.
3,I love this book!,"His writings and encounters are so inspirational! I would have given the book a 5 star rating but (and i dont know if its just my download - kindle and kindle for Mac) but theres a couple of chapters thats missing. During the part on prayer, section 2 it numbers 1-6 and then skips to the part on serving, section 1 number 4. In all im missing Prayer, section 2 numbers 7-10, Prayer section 3 numbers 1-10 and Serving section 1 numbers 1-3. Just fyi. Theres some good stuff in the missing ""Prayer"" section."
4,Heroes and Friends,"This is a rather decent taste of Travis' work. I did not buy this for the fact that it is a duet compliation of songs; rather for the fact that Travis is on it. Some of the songs are great (""Come See About Me"" with Conway Twitty, ""Waiting for the Light to Change"" with BB King, ""All Night Long"" with Merle Haggard and ""A Few Old Country Boys"" with George Jones). Other offerings should have been left on the cutting room floor (""Smokin' The Hive"" with Clint Eastwood - YES THE ACTOR!! - ""Do I Ever Cross Your Mind"" with Dolly Parton, and ""Shopping for Dresses"" with Lorretta Lynn). All in all, I would recommend to any fan of Travis - fun thingh about technology and CDs is that you can skip over the less-than-entertaining songs mentioned."
5,"Light, flavorful and crispy cracker","I have a gluten sensitivity so tried these crackers, what a find! They are pricey but wonderful with all cheeses or by themselves. I serve them when entertaining and guests always ask me the name of these crackers, and say they are going to get them because they are so good. Try them, you won't regret it!!!"
5,Fantasy,"This is one of Mariah's best songs to date, and a timeless classic! This is disc #1 of a 2-disc set, both released in the UK. This one contains the Album Version, the Bad Boy Remixes and the Def Club Mix, while disc #2 contains the MC Mix, The Boss Mix, and the Sweet Dub Mix, which are much harder to find. I recommend getting both discs to complete the set!"
5,One of the best,A true classic. Haven't seen this since it first aired 30 years ago. Five stars all the way. I loved it
3,Not much about Jomon culture,"I was rather disappointed in this book, but then I'm not much into high adventure, either. The book is more of a journal of one man's quest to experience the realities of the Eastward quest of the early Americans during the last of the Ice Ages. While I admit the book has many exciting moments that will appeal to those who enjoy risky adventures, I don't think those of us who hoped to learn more about the Joman culture and about it's possible peopling of the Americas."
5,an extraordinary story,"I have just finished reading this wonderful book. I couldn't put it down. The author's journey is so fascinating that I read it with our family's globe in front of me on our coffee table. I would always be looking at the globe to find the different locations Jon Turk (the author) visits along the way. This book held a lot of relevance for me as I live in a northern country (Canada) and was interested to read about the lives of the people Jon Turk met who live along the outer edges of Siberia.In addition, while it makes you think about the connectedness of all humankind, for those of us who live in North America it is a wonderful opportunity to learn how people came to our continent so many thousands of years ago."
2,Makes your hair stiff & stringy,"I don't know if this stuff actually works, I do know it makes your hair look and feel terrible after you apply it. My hair does not look good until after I shampoo this stuff out. And Wow! is it expensive, you could get monoxodil and/or propecia for this much."
3,Didn't notice any changes,"This is probably the third round I have tried Nioxin products. Each time, I don't really notice any positive changes. Nothing negative either. I guess it might work for some people, but if I have to struggle to notice a difference, then it's really not worth the cost."
2,Dry in your hair like gel...,It dries up hard like you put a gel on. Then it is quite hard to comb after it dried. I will stick with the Follicle Booster.
4,spray pump doesn't spray foam that effectively,"spray pump doesn't work that effectively because most of the time it will pump liquid before it will pump foam and so too much product ends up coming out in liquid form and it ends up running. Also, it makes your hair rock hard, which is annoying. Besides that it seems to work fine. If nothing else there is a psychological benefit that it actually does something. lol"
4,it is a mousse??,"I had used the System 1 scalp treatment and assumed this was the same type of gel. It is a foam, which acts like a mousse - in the beginning I was not sure of it, but as long as I understood that I should only use a bit of it, not a lot I was happy with it."
3,Nioxin Scalp Treatment,"Although I've used Nioxin products for approximately 10 years, I'm less than completely satisfied with this particular purchase. While the scalp treatment itself is fine, I decided to buy the 6.8 ounce bottle because it seemed more economical, and the price was in fact better than anywhere else I shopped. However, on a whim I decided to measure the fluid ounces contained in the bottle using a measuring beaker and discovered that instead of the 6.8 ounces listed on the container, it only measured out to be approximately 6.2 ounces. This may seem like a negligible difference for most people, but to me nearly half an ounce is rather sizeable. I may shop elsewhere next time."
4,Good product,"So far, it works on my husbands' thinning hair. Could make these in larger sizes or 6 packs as they go so quickly."
3,Not too sure,"I'm not too sure whether I like this product or not. When I first started using Nioxin products I originally used the products for normal hair (System 1) and I liked them. Then I realized I was actually supposed to be using the system 2 items for for my hair and when I started using the Scalp Activating treatment it made my hair feel very stiff like it was full of hairspray. Granted it made my hair feel thicker and possibly look thicker but I do not like the way it feels in my hair. I don't know if this is due to my hair being long (about shoulder length) or not. Even as I continue to use it, it does not seem to change or get any better."
3,Makes my scalp tingle but also dry,"I'm not sure if this product is working or not, but it does make my scalp tingle. The one drawback is that it also dries out my hair and somewhat my scalp as well. I also used the nioxin scalp peel. I now have a bunch of new Vellus hair growth in the front of my scalp where the hair had receded."
1,Not Usable as Shipped,"This product cannot be used without specialized tips that adapt your laptop charger to the powerpad for charging and adapt the powerpad to your computer for supplying power. These tips are not included with the product, they must be ordered from the Electrovaya website for $5 each plus a very steep shipping charge. The customer service folks there are not interested in helping or sympathizing. They will just tell you to order the tips, or talk to Amazon.So, here is the process: Order the PowerPad, Recieve the PowerPad, Open the Box, Try to Figure out How to Charge It, Read the Manual, Realize You Don't Have the Parts You Need, Figure Out that the Electrovaya Website is the Place to Go, Order the Tips, Pay the High Shipping Charges, Receive the Tips. Now you are finally ready to go.I am shippinig mine back out of sheer frustration."
2,Not Bad For A Junior High School Project!,"From the artificial dialogue, to the amateurish acting, to the clumsy editing, illogical plot line, and missing scenes, this movie (starring one of my favorite actors of all time, Chazz P.) contains almost nothing worth watching . Character development is non-existent, machoism rules supreme, and little makes real-world sense in this rather silly film. (Dang, but I hate to say that about a Chazz P. movie!)Very, very avoidable is ""Body Armour."""
2,Why did I watch the whole thing???,"This movie was very thin on plot, highly predictable, full of cliches and very weak dialog. Full of action though the fight choreography could have been so much better, I don't think I've seen much worse. Overall, I'd say pass on this one."
2,This movie isn't good as I thought!,This movie isn't good as I thought it will be! So I rate it as FAIR growing old to POOR.
3,Where's Winner On Winner?,"How has this book not been updated and reissued? Printed in 1978, it simply doesnt' cover enough material. The 1980s would bring his Death Wish sequels. Viewed today, Winner's insights might be interesting, particularly regarding Death Wish 3, which is possibly a genius piece of satire.Given Winner's visibility and his second career as restaurant/food critic, it's unlikely he'll pass up another chance to wax on about his views. The full Winner oevre deserves a better book."
4,Easy,Worked great not as runny as other some other fireplace sealants i have used. Great for minor fireplace cracks and pointing. Only drawback was the color was much darker than normal firplace grout. but after a few fires it wont show i'm sure
2,"Heavy, hard to adjust straps.","We have had this carseat since 2006, and I hate it. The stroller is ok for the most part. Everyone said to get a carseat with the z-handle, so we did. I don't know if I like the handle or not, because it is such a heavy carseat to lug around that the handle hardly seems to make a difference. It doesn't fit my kids very well for whatever reason....they are both long-waisted though, so maybe that is why. We have had a lot of trouble getting the base to remain ""safe"" in the car. Also, the straps are a little hard to adjust- I've gotten better at it with all the practice from two kids, but still....The stroller is also big and bulky, although I love the storage it has, and it has held up pretty well (we have not been gentle to it!) overall. But yes, the carseat is not so great. Perhaps the newer models have improved, since they seem smaller and hopefully a lot less heavy."
3,Car seat is difficult to adjust,The stroller in this travel system is pretty good but I have a problem with the car seat. I find it very difficult to adjust the straps to keep them fitting snugly on my daughter. To start with you have to adjust them in the back which is awkward to reach anyway (especially in the car) and it takes so much strength to pull them tighter it's almost impossible for me to do (loosening them is easy enough). Even my husband has a very hard time tightening the straps. I would recommend getting a car seat that allows you to adjust the tightness of the straps easily in the front.
5,Superb!,"I found out about this album from the new web site, JesseDayton.com. This is an excellent album, and you must look at the site! You can sample each song on the album! This is a must buy CD!"
2,"Some Okay, Some Out There","Geez, it's shows like this that make it hard for people to take things seriously, when in fact, they should take them seriously, but who would after watching someting like this? There were a few good points, but over all it just made people who believe certain things look like freaking nuts. I can't reommend this one at all."
3,interesting but not impartial,"i do agree that there has yet to be a work like this and in that the authors basis is very interesting.to have reveiwed all of these works at times i felt the author had little understanding of the kreigsmarine of ww2.and for some one who he devots so much time to the author clearly should have known that herbert werner never received the knights cross much less from the hands of donitz.a little disappointed in that he dismisses nearly all of the wartime works as ""nazi"" propaganda. alot of monday morning quarterbacking the decisions made in the conduct of the german naval war.this book really is more for the literature historian not the military or u-boat"
2,1998 4X4 F250 gvw7200 not covered well,first off my brakes on the rear were completely different from the photos in the book.second thing front rotors do not come right off the hub like book says the rotor is the hub on my truck. you have to remove three bolts on the back side of the spindle and a 1 3/8 nut on the front to remove the rotor. I also changed the heater core without discharging the A/C system but the book says to discharge and recharge the system.wow that seems like an expensive error to me.
5,A reference book of hints and tips!,"I highly recommend this book. Like a ""pearl"" this book is a valueable tool that will save you time and money. I have already put to practice many of the tips I have read in it. Tips from recycling things you would normally throw away into useful items, time saving laundry tips, gardening tips, health tips, and much more. There are so many tips and hints I can't remember them all, that I keep it handy as a reference."
5,Great book for country and city folks alike!,"What a reference this book is! Inspiring to the homemaker in the country or the city- helpful for anyone wishing to learn to make things from scratch, to make things with what they already 'have on hand'. I find this a great accompanyment to Carla Emery's book- it covers what that does not.....great herbal recipes, soapmaking tips, hundreds of suggestions to be sure to make life more simple, the COUNTRY WAY!"
3,Easylistening Spanish,"Light-footed singing and hand-clapping. Well done, but not as intense as La Nitra or Camaron. Good musicians.Peter"
3,Not What Was Advertised,"When I purchased this item, I was expecting to receive a box of 4 Performax (60-6180) 180 grit pre-cut sandpaper rolls. Instead I received a box of 4 hand-cut rolls of sandpaper from an unknown source. While I expect that the sandpaper will satisfy my needs (why I gave it 3 stars instead of 1), it's not what was advertised for sale, nor what I expected to receive."
5,great dinnerware set!,I've had this set for a month now and just love them. I am thinking of using them year round.
3,These are not the same dishes as they used to be,"If you are considering purchasing a few replacement pieces for an older china set you may have, stop, do not purchase these. These aren't the same lovely delicate dishes that were manufactured in England until 2003. These dishes are made in China, and are heavier, and not as delicate as they used to be. If you want the Made in England dishes you need to search your local antique stores and replacement pattern stores."
5,Elegant & Casual,"My 2 sets arrived today in perfect condition and so beautiful I want to put them on display. What a bargain, with 3 sizes of bowls and the bonus square plates! The only thing that would have increased my satisfaction with this purchase would be that I had waited a couple of days to order them. The price dropped about $7/set. So if you're thinking about buying them, do it now and get the best deal around."
1,very poor quality china,"The order of Johnson Brothers Friendly Village 28-piece set I just received is on its way back to Amazon. The shipping box was so flimsy and had so little packing paper I am surprised it made it here at all. The box was giving way and ripped at the corner. The inner box wasn't in much better shape. It was on its side and the top was ripping. Three pieces were pretty well shattered since all were so poorly packed, only in cardboard with edges not protected and nothing sealed. I am amazed more weren't broken. That was bad enough, but the quality of the china was so very poor. I have some of this pattern from when it was made in England, and the difference in quality is striking. I have always loved Johnson Brothers china but will have to look for it in antique stores. These dishes are not worth buying at any price.Johnson Brothers Friendly Village 28-Piece Set with Square Accent Plates, Service for 4"
5,Johnson Brothers Friendly Village dises,These dishes are just beautiful. I love them and so does my daughter-in-law.I bought them as a gift to her. They fit a young life-style with mugs instead of cup and saucer and lots of bowls.
5,Arrived Broken but Amazon took Care of it.,"This set arrived with three broken pieces. I'm not surprised because of the distance it had to travel.On the positive side, I called Amazon and they are sending an ENTIRE replacement set for free! Anyway, Amazon asked me to send the broken pieces back (okay, but strange).In summary, despite the problems with delivery I must say that this is a very nice set... it is home-y. It's also pretty nice for a single guy to have; I think it is masculine and classy. Why shouldn't a guy have the finer things?"
4,The Ultimate Collection,"This is the first collection of hits from The Isley Brothers to contain their early hits from Tamla/Motown (Shout Part 1) and their ground breaking soul hits on T-Neck (top ten songs like It's Your Thing, That Lady and Fight The Power, which was later used in the Spike Lee movie ""Do The Right Thing""). This collection shows how the Isleys were a formidable force in R&B music alongside acts like Earth, Wind & Fire and Parliament/Funkadelic, and they continued their success (in various incarnations through the 80s and 90s. This set also contains the anthemic ""Harvest For The World"", but the only thing that prevents me from giving this a five star rating is the omission of ""At Your Best (You Are Love)"" which was a #6 hit for Aaliyah in 1994."
5,Isley Bros cd,Excellent condition and sound. Rockin' out! Great idea for me to order; heard a song in a movie I was watching and realized all I had was vinyl.
3,"50% is good, rest are duds","Considering there are 17 tracks on this CD, and since I'm a die-hard Isley's fan, I can say that about half the tracks are Isley classics, and the rest is ""filler"". I mean, what is a cover of ""Shout"" (""... you know you make me wanna SHOUT, put my hands up and SHOUT...."" from the Blue Brothers) doing on an Isley CD? I'd recommend instead the Isley's 3+3 CD. Every track on that CD is slamming!!"
2,The Ultimate Isley Brothers,Really bad recording. Mastering sucked. Barely able to listen to it. Pass this one up.
4,It can't be done.,"It's impossible to fit all the Isleys best onto one cd. Most of the tracks are edited and it's still impossible. This cd is missing such songs as ""This Old Heart Of Mine"", ""Pop That Thing"", ""What It Comes Down To"", ""Who Loves You Better"", ""(At Your Best) You Are Love"", and ""Voyage To Atlantis"". If you are a casual Isleys fan get the box set and if you're a serious fan get a best of collection of their 60's work and each album they released from ""Brother, Brother, Brother"" to ""Between The Sheets""."
5,re-readable,"I have been reading POGO ever since it first appeared in the newspapers. I am glAD TO NOTE THAT MY SON (NOW IN FIFTIES) IS ALSO A fan. POGO has provided me with humor, philosophy, and anything else you can say. Walt Kelly had a genius for peering into the human behavior and interpreting that behavior with a possum, alligator, turtle, owl, etc. Who else could begin to approach his genius?"
5,"if you like Erma Bombeck, you will love Teresa Bloomingdale",This is the collections of thoughts of a mother of 10 in the 1960s and 1970s. Her writing has humor and heart not often seen in contemporary writers today.
1,nothing good to say,"this was the werst deal i have ever seen! firs it takes weeks to get this so called deal and bang what a deal to wait for, i got my order 3 weeks after i placed it and when i receved them every blade had a tooth mising and some faling off blades off balanced and i just cant say anything good about this. amazon has got realy bad with the qualaty of thear products im so up set with this"
3,Hit & Miss,"yup a hit and miss remix compilation. Not the place to start for New icehouse listeners! just old songs recorded differently, some good, some not so good.highlight is ""shakin the cage"""
2,incorrect size information,It says Size 6 - 12. My daughter wears size 10 shoes. It can hardly fit in.
3,Be careful!,"I bought these for my then 2 year old daughter. She loves them, and the pads they come with are super cute. Unfortunately, the wheels turn extremely fast, so there is no stopping her as soon as she stands up. She can only wear them if she is on grass or carpet. Even then, we have to be right by her. The other kid skates we have owned were adjusted so the wheels barely turned, making it easy for them to learn to be up on wheels. I would not recommend these as first skates!"
4,Loves these skates,"So far so good. Skates and pads appear sturdy. My 3.5 year old fits them but they are fully extended. She didn't take the skates off for 2 days :) I'd recommend these, but not sure about the sizing as my little girl is small for her age."
3,Fun for kids,"My 3 1/2 yr old rec'd these for the holidays. She does great with them on the carpet, but they are pretty slippery on the hard wood floors. Will try to use them outside once the snow melts. They are plastic, so not much to them, but fun starter skates."
2,Dora Skates,I didn't like these at all. The toes are too pointy and wouldn't fit. Might be ok for younger children than stated.
1,Cheap and not so cheerful!,"These broke within minutes of being opened. Yes, they are cheap, but you would expect the straps to last a little longer! The stitching on the strap caused the perforations to tear at the slightest pull. Didn't bother to return at that price, but I certainly wouldn't recommend to anyone."
4,Good basics,"Good basic skates, including pads. Easily fit over shoes, and have proven dependable. Are holding up well with repeated use. Nice fat wheels."
2,No shoes fit in...,"We got it when our daughter was 3 years old. She loved it because it was Dora! Howerver none of her sneakers fit in because of the small plastic arch around the toe. Only shoes we were able to find to fit in were ballet flats and slippers! She still loved to skate with slippers, but I did not like it at all for the safety. The rollers went too fast unless she stayed on carpet or grass. She finally learned to control by the brake this spring but it was too small for her by summer... I would try something else for our second child."
2,so so,"We bought these for my 3 year old niece, they were not very stable and she really didn't like them at all...."
2,"Shoddy, untypical Rick Steves","I live in Sweden and have done a fair amount of traveling around the region. I own several of Rick's books, including his UK book which was quite good for our trip there last month. However, this book is second rate in content and quality.The book is very thin and leaves out both very significant places and essential details about the places it covers. Scandinavia is fabulous, but this book won't get you too far. Unfortunately I haven't found one that will. ....The quality of the book is horrible. I was chasing pages down the streets of Tallinn cursing Rick's name two days ago. A tour book should be able to hold together. Carrying it around is really the point, right?"
2,Too Thin,"Although I've found several of the Rick Steve's books great, this one is not. I'm staying in Stockholm for four months and the book simply does not cover many things in Sweden. There's very little mention of the archipelago around Stockholm. The treatment of the Stockholm museums is equally weak. I think Sweden desreves a book of it's own -- not folded into a Norway, Sweden, Denmark book where none get the attention they deserve. I have the Rick Steve's Scotland book. That's an example of the treatment Sweden should get. In the particular treatment of Stockholm, I wonder if Steve (or his staff) wrote it from the view of a person taking a boat here and having only a day or two. Beyond a few days, the ""Stockholm"" portion of the book is worthless."
5,This Cd is AWESOME,I am a HUGE Billy Gilman fan and I just love his Classic Chritmas CD. I espsecially like the song Warm & Fuzzy If you like Billy Gilman then you will definatley love this CD. The CD has a lot of Chistmas spirit in it well duh what did you expect its a Christmas CD!!
5,Gilman forever,"First I heard the new album of Billy, Dare to Dream and it was really great!!!!There are 12 songs on it and every number was a masterpiece to my ears! I didn't heard this album yet, because I just ordered it, but I just know I'm going to love it! I first heard of Billy Gilman at Oprah. Here in Holland the broadcast is a bit later than in America, so therefore I didn't hear of Billy before. We don't know him in the Netherlands yet, but I know he is a superstar!! One voice could make me cry, so I think this cd also can make me cry. Such a voice!! Wow!!! You MUST hear it!!!!!"
4,pretty good,"I had his CD ""One Voice"" and loved it. Since it was Christmas, I decided to buy this CD. It's pretty good. His music tends to be the kind that you need to listen to, it's not background music."
4,Good job Billy,"I own this album. However I would of liked to hear him sing the Drummer Boy song before his voice changes too much. Such a song is perfect for an alto singer like Billy Gilman. However it is not the same if a man sings it.I wish you luck Billy, love your singing, You are the best."
5,"The perfect happy, fun Christmas CD",I LOVE this album!! It has become one of my top three favorites over the past few Cchristmases! I highly recommend it!
2,Disappointing,"I've purchased these balls before, closer to Christmas, and they were great, but with my last box, purchased in August, many of the balls were stale."
3,Had no choice,"Walmart stopped carrying these and I had to get some. Way too much shipping charge for a small, light item."
1,Bait and switch,"I was eagerly looking forward to listening to the CD album by Danny Elfman for his score for the film"" 'Dick Tracy"" which I ordered recently. To my horror, the CD inside was totally NOT the score from the film as I expected but some terrible collection of really bad music by some other band. Totally NOT what I ordered. Thankfully, AMAZON came to the rescue. This is the first time I have ever had this happen. It's nice to know that we can trust AMAZON to take care of its' custmers."
4,Music to mellow you.,"Jen Shyu's cd makes me want to hear more from her in other venues. While not a jazz fan, her voice is so smooth that when I want to mellow out, this is the first cd I go to. I would love to hear her do some classics as well as big band songs. I am anxious for the release of her next album and will buy it even if it is jazz."
5,I can't live without,"I am suspicious of talking, because the fragrance of Her Ckin2u reflects my personality.The fragrance is striking, seductive, appealing. He has the balance of strong and soft at the right. Simply can not live without! Fixing it is excellent! Sprayed two are enough.I highly recommend it!"
4,Great!,"The smell is fruity. For me, it's a little too sweet. HOWEVER, the lotion is great. It's serum-like, and leaves my skin super smooth and not greasy at all."
4,"Believe it or not, this was for my teen daughter!",My teenager loves the scent so it was big hit as a gift at Christmas.
2,Didn't blend for me,"I'm not really a fan. What I get from this fragrance is amber and citrus, and the two bodies of notes aren't well mixed. They don't seem to work well together at all. This fragrance seemed to be in a constant state of discord- it just didn't gel for me."
2,hated the smell,I had the 2006 version and I hated the smell of this one. I have since given the bottle away.
1,CKIN2U,While I love the perfume itself I had wayyyyy too much trouble getting it. The company didn't scan it right so it didn't arrive until almost a month after I ordered it... and that was after I emailed them about it twice!! On top of that I ordered a 5oz bottle and the one I recieved was 3.4 oz and when I emailed them they said it was Amazon's fault and that they scanned it wrong. So I didn't get a refund or a new bottle like I asked. Very disappointed since I was really looking forward to getting the perfume because it's nice.
5,very warm,I first smelled this perfume when I took a chance a couple of months ago and purchased a bottle from Marshalls without smelling it..I am a big fan of all the CK scents...then I saw that Amazon had this perfume at a WAY better price I got over 3 times more for less than $10.00 compared to the bottle I purchased at Marshalls. This perfume is my new favorite!! It goes on smelling fresh and citusy..then dries down to a warm cozy amber smell..I love it..I love how my clothes smell at the end of the day when I take them off...this scent is just there lightly lingering..it is a pretty sexy scent that is also appropriate for day wear..love it..huge value!!
3,Interesting book on Pennsylvania iron work,"I liked this book, but it is hard to get around the sloppy work done in copying it. I had a difficult time reading the text. I was very interested in the subject, but may have to buy another edition to get a complete understanding of the text. The picture reproduction was correspondingly poor as well."
3,Post Pistols,"I first heard ""Join the Professionals"" at a friends house in 1984 and loved it. This is by far their best song. 1-2-3 is a good rocker with a definite ""anthem"" feel to it. ""Just another Dream"" is probably the only other good song on this compilation though. The rest falls flat. Pick up the soundtrack to ""The Great Rock & Roll Swindle"" for more good Cook & Jones tunes. I wish they had included ""Black Leather"" & ""Here We Go Again"" as bonus tracks. If you're a Sex Pistols fan, this is a good addition to your collection."
4,Good Micro-Horror!!,"Just the facts:- Tense and suspenseful killer-clown thriller.- Nudity-wise, we have two pairs of breasts, male buttock nudity, and a FULL FEMALE PUBIC SHOT during a murder scene that the director rightly describes on one of the commentary tracks as borderline pornographic.- LOTS of the red stuff, but mostly aftermath shots.- The performances and direction are pretty strong. Christena Doggrell comes across nicely as the troubled protagonist, and the film has a good visual style.- The dvd is first rate and includes two audio commentaries - a fun dialogue between director and actress, and an articulate scene specific commentary by the director alone. There are five deleted scenes with optional commentary, a funny blooper reel, and a throwaway trailer.- Micro-budget, but nice work overall. If you like dead-eyed seriousness in your horror films, Intruder is worth a look."
1,Killer clowns are neat but this movie is trash.,"Let me just start by saying stop right there and do not see this waste of time. Killer clowns are neat but this movie is trash. I think every thing that happens in this movie you will be asking yourself why, example why is it pouring rain and three people come into the house and are dry as a bone, why if I stab this dude in the ear would chocolate syrup pour out and why is the blood on the door cherry cough syrup ?The cop in this movie is the saddest cop to ever breath air, if I see this kind of carnage I run back to the car call for back up grab the shot gun and start kicken down doors. Come on this could have been a good movie, we have the sex and gore just no story."
1,Donot buy this movie,This movie was so stupt i bought this movie on DVD and watched the movie and this movie made no sence there was time that this movie was scary but not at all donot waste your money on this DVD it was so STUPET
5,Raisin in the Sun cliffnotes,This cliffnote resource book for A Raisin in the Sun provides analytic discussion topics as well as makes a great test question generator. I pull information right out of the notes and create my tests from there.Great teacher resource.
5,Joe and the Boys Rock!!!,"If you like the blues (and i know you do) pick this one up. And if you get a chance to see Joe live, do it!!!He is an amazing guitar player (and he can sing, too)"
5,Bonamassa Rocks,"I have just recently seen Bonamassa at Konocti Harbor and was completely surprised. I figured he was just there as a warm up band for George Thorogood. On the contrary his performance was outstanding. Shades of Stevie Ray Vaughn,Jimi Hendrix,Eric Clapton and Duane Almond came through the intricate guitar work. Some of the music was laced with the old style jam session with vocals that were powerful.Throughout the entire show the music held a special quality that was all his own. After the gig I purchased this cd and So,It's like that. Both cd's are an accurate reflection of the live version. If you get a chance to see this performer don't miss it. Don't be surprised !!!"
5,Wow,"I never thought I would say that someone was better than, or even as good as Stevie Ray Vaughn, but I have heard this amazing new guitarist, and it took my breath away. Joe is as good if not better than SRV, although I hate to compare different players. I do hear a little of Eric C. also in his music. If you like blues guitar, you owe it to yourself to buy this cd. Words cannot do justice to the talent of this young man!!!"
5,and he's only 21...,I have not heard this much passion squeezed out of a guitar since SRV played Little Wing. Just awsome.
5,JOE IS DA MAN!,Joe's style is blues/rock. He has a great original sound. This is a great album that showcases his talent. He could be considered a prodigy. Give him a look/listen on youtube. Good stuff!
3,Not quite what I expected,"To be honest, I need to listen to this CD several more times before I can give it a quality review. That being said, I'm a little disappointed. My understanding is that Joe is a phenomenal guitar player, but the songs on the CD don't seem to highlight that to me. I expected the guitar work to stand out much more from the accompaniment, and figured there would be some really hot riffs that would blow me away. Not so. I was also surprised at his vocals, which seem to overwhelm the music a lot. This is my first Bonamassa CD and I'm sure it won't be my last, but I'll preview the songs more in the future!"
3,A nice start,"The guest visits by Leslie West, Rick Derringer, and Greg Allman were wasted. Uninspired work on their part. The backup vocalists for Miss You, Hate You though worked out well.Very promising stuff on his originals. His Albert King cover Don't Burn Down the Bridge is puzzling to me as he elsewhere nails the Albert thing. Stevie Ray had no problem doing a very reverent rip of Albert when he covered him. Don't know if I would go as far as saying the cover evoked memories of Spinal Tap BIG BOTTOM.The guy even at this point has wonderful chops but is still figuring out who HE is. His latest You And Me is a lot more even and still as eclectic. His synthesis of influences is more complete and personalized as you would expect.One wonders what the guy will be like a decade from now presuming he is still at it. His thing seems to work much better as a live trio than studio. This suggests the live version of this CD might be better, albeit more indulgent."
3,"I'd prefer 3.5, but it's not 4","There are many tasty guitar licks on this (see all the glowing reviews) and I bet it does sound great live. But there is too much filler for my taste. The vocals are raw and spirited, the sound good (though not great)the songs mostly fine. A pleasant journey, with a standout A New Day Yesterday (this from someone who saw Jethro Tull when that was a new song, and loves their earliest work--Benefit being my favorite) that almost makes it worth it alone. But not a release that elevates him to the guitar pantheon.Not a disappointment, not a thrill, but a well-made, well-packaged guy who sounds as if he will only improve. Just drop the mechanical sound (I Know Where I Belong), and let it rip."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this disc because my brother is a big fan of this guy. He's also very much into Stevie Ray Vaughn. Trouble is, Joe Bonamassa is basically a Stevie Ray clone here. Lot's of hard driving blues rock with the guitar front and center. But there is nothing new here that wasn't done better earlier - like Stevie Ray or Buddy Guy etc. The songwriting is a bit weak. My big complaint is the lack of variety in the music. I expect guys who are basically ""guitar heros"" to mix it up a bit - a la Jeff Beck or Eric Johnson. There is an all too brief flourish of acoustic guitar playing that only leaves you wanting more. Sadly the album just winds up being repetitive."
3,Talk about overplaying -- !,"Is Joe Bonamassa technically proficient or soulfully masterful? The former, certainly. By definition someone who is technically proficient can play many different styles, but underperforms and overplays. Joe can certainly play the blues, and has good knowledge of the style, but throughout this album, he overplays and is more like Yingwie Malmsteen than Stevie Ray Vaughn. In fact, comparisons to SRV are disrespectful to the legacy of SRV and a guitarist like Mato Nanji (of Indigenous) is more deserving of that honor.Not to take anything away from the album as a whole, just the comparisons made to SRV. The album as a whole shows Joe is a beginner. Check out the improvements made on ""So It's Like That."" There he achieves the pop-rock/Blues-rock he wants to attain without the heavy overplaying."
3,Good Energy,This album is good to just throw in your car CD player and fire up a couple of songs while you drive.As a guitar player he has good energy and lays down a nice guitar sound. The vocals are pretty strong on about half the songs.My favorite track at this point is the title track.
3,Entertaining,"It's a bit hokey and silly, but it's a must-have for the fan of her earlier music. ""Cropped and Chronicled"" is right...especially the 'cropped' part...it's a bit choppy. However, there are a few videos on this CD you'll have a hard time finding anywhere else including ""Honkeytonk Angel's Medley"" - ""Crying"" - ""Barefoot"" - ""Ridin' the Rails""Overall, it's worth it."
1,poor CD,I was send 2 CD's at 2 different times and they were defective. Have not been able to hear her CD yet. Would like to get a good CD of K.D. Langes Harvest of Seven Years. I was told I could not get a 3rd one.
3,Good for Collectors; Cheesy Packaging,"If you want to time-trip to the LIS episodes via the music and the cues, here you go. LIS was prime escapist television from the bountiful fount of Irwin Allen, and like its stable mate, Voyage To The Bottom of The Sea, featured trite, geared-to-kiddies plots and low-budget special effects.The packaging for such an expensive two disk ""limited edition"" is a shame. The flimsy swing-out jewel box fell apart in my hands as I openred it. I had to replace it with an old two-disk stacker type I had left over from old software."
1,Proceed at your own risk,I ordered this product and parts were missing.... Tried to contact seller via the info on shipment info and numbers are disconnected and changed. Be Warned!
3,Need sharpeners,"I have three of these that I lend my students who come to class unprepared. The novelty wears off quickly, and they can't walk away with them, but my problem is that I can't find a sharpender big enough for them, so I end up doing it with a knife. Any suggestions?"
3,big pencil,You can get this pencil cheaper on amazon better than ebay. I have a collection of pencils like this from cities and states.
2,Not built well,It was cheap but the eraser started falling off the day I got it. I had to tape it back on but what the hell? It's a giant freakin' pencil! I keep it at my desk at work so I can ask people if they want to use my big pencil. :) It's worth the few bucks.
5,Accountants Giant Wooden Pencil,This is a great product! Very well made and was exactly what I was looking for. If you are a teacher this would be a fun thing to have in your classroom. The price is right and we have had a lot of fun with the one we bought!
1,not worth the purchase,I was not happy with the pencil at all. Poor quality just cheep all the way around. Pay the extra money to have better quality.
1,HORRIBLE!!,First of all I didn't even get my package. My address is right because I have ordered things and got them before from Amazon. Second of all IT'S NOT FREE SHIPPING. Your ending up paying $5.00 for shipping. I was going to get the pencil as a joke but that never happened and now I'm working on a refund. Take my advice don't waste your time buying this product it will never show up.
2,"Technically, it's a large pencil","I didn't notice the ""Colors may vary"" text, so mine was red, not yellow. The shape is actually octagonal, not hex like a real pencil. While the lead had a plastic protective cap, of the two pencils I ordered, both were broken. Both the eraser and area under the protective cap shows significant wear from handling. Since this was for a fabrication project, I hedged my bets and also got a pencil from Pencil Craft online. Theirs is properly made, well packaged and quite nice, and not much more expensive."
3,Hard read,"I was very excited about this book. I have found Karen Ranney to be a very enjoyable read. However, the story of Tessa and Jered is one a bit different than her other books that I have read, (After the Kiss, GREAT book!)In the first chapter Tessa and Jered are married. His only need for a wife is to have children, otherwise he is not interested in her. She on the other hand loves him. He goes out of his way to make her hate him. He becomes so mean and unkind (leaving for his other home the night after there wedding without telling her, Kissing his misstress in front of her, to name a few) that I had to put the book down and come back later when I was not so made at him. In the end I was glad that I finished it, because I did enjoy it. It was a good book, but you have to be able to read and get past Jered's actions to fully enjoy and even finish the book!"
2,Hero's character was too flawed!,"I thought kept hoping that Jered would reform but it didn't happen until the very end of the story--but it was too little too late. By the time Jered was penitent and realized his mistakes, it was too late for me to like him. Tessa was excessive in her forgiving nature. I kept wishing she would exhibit some spunk, a spark of independence or teach him a much deserved lesson. She never really does and I was further annoyed/disappointed. I suppose her nature is much preferred to those overly proud characters found in other books-- but I would like to see a little more backbone. I found her character to be a bit annoying, overly child like. She prattled on, asking too many silly questions.I am not saying that this novel is entirely without merit, it had its momments, but on the whole it was mediocre.Still, I find Reding has a nice writing style. I will still give her other books a try."
2,Good writing but the characters?....,"Karen Ranney definitely has a flair for writing but I must disagree with everyone who thinks Jered Mandeville is the best thing since Swiss cheese. How depraved can one person be? Tessa certainly didn't deserve a jerk like him. She should've found someone who didn't go from voyeurism one night to depraved parties the next. I think Tessa's parents were a stronger couple than Tessa and her duke. Also, if I didn't see the date in the beginning of the book, I would really have never guessed that this took place during Georgian times. Where were the wigs and the high heels? After reading so many stellar reviews, I was a little disappointed....."
2,Good writing but plot is too dark,"Karen Ranney is an exceptional writer, but I didn't like this book very much. Jered was very unlikable...too depraved, arrogant, and cynical. His only redeeming quality was his good looks. I much prefer humorous, honorable heroes. Karen Ranney's book Beloved is much more romantic. In my opinion, the best book ever is Shanna by Kathleen Woodiwiss. Ruark is the perfect hero. I wish all books could be like that."
4,Emotions rolled as I read this one!,"Tessa and Jered's story had my emotions rolling. He is so dead set against feeling anything for her that I sometimes wanted to crawl into the book and knock him upside the head. Tessa keeps him on his toes with her straight forwardness when it comes to his behavior, which I loved. Wonderful characters and a moving story sure to earn a place in your heart."
3,Just Not It,"I really thought that I would enjoy this story. I had read the back cover and thought, great story. Well, I started to get into it for a moment, then it changed. The girl became his wife but he thought it was still ok to be a slut and play with his life. He didnt think much of her, didnt want her around and could care less about her. While she was so in love with him that she followed him, hunted him down, went to see his mistress, and still wanted to have his baby. Look there was a lot that went on in this read. I didnt like that he was a major ass to everyone and a mean person. At the end of the story he was still in ass but because she still loved him made it all ok. I would not have put up with his stuff. She should not have either. But I loved the Mother of the wife. I would want my mom to be just like her. All in all this book made me more upset then lovey dovey."
4,Introspective,"I have enjoyed all of this authors books. The beginning of this book seemed predictable and slow, but soon built up steam until I couldn't put it down. It was so full of surprises and unexpected humor, I found myselt gasping with laughter. I did not like Jared very much but he was trying so hard to be unlikeable and I understood him much better at the end of the book. The imagination of this author really fascinates me. The church yard scene was so real and unusual. I really enjoyed Tessa's introspections. And Tessa's mother is a jewel."
1,Disgusted,"I purchased two if Karen Ranney's books but if this is an accurate example of her style, I want my money back. I find no way to make any sort of sympathetic connection to the selfish jack-ass that is Jered and the stupdily naive Tessa. Honestly, although I have only read about half way through, I am ready to just burn this book to ashes. Short of self-castration, there is nothing Jered can do to win over my sympathies, and even then I doubt it would change my mind. And Tessa! Why on earth would she want to befriend someone who obviously does NOT care for her even when he confesses to admiring some of her qualities (apparently he forgot to list ""idiotic"" and ""has no self-esteem whatsoever"") When she calls herself an idiot, she's right! I am willing to just drop this book and give Ranney one last chance but if her other books turn out to be as horribly written as this one, I may throw up!"
5,"Not only the kind of book that helps you to prepare for a visit and to enjoy it, but also a souvenir you will treasure...","This guide to the Metropolitan Museum of Art helped me to plan what I wanted to see in that museum, and to learn beforehand about many of the works of art I was going to find there (for example European paintings, Egyptian, Greek and Roman Art, etc...). What is more, this book allowed me to read about some paintings and sculptures I didn't have time to see, even though I would have loved to be able to do so (too many beautiful things to see, to little time). Well, I suppose next time I will just have to start by the 2nd floor!.I think you will appreciate the beautiful color illustrations, and the opportunity to plan ahead of your trip and not in a hurry what you want to see first. This is not only the kind of book that helps you to prepare for a visit and to enjoy it, but also a souvenir you will treasure after returning from your holidays. Recommended!Belen Alcat"
3,New Edition,"According to the review in the New York Times (Friday April 13, 2012, page C19) and the Yale University Press site there is a new edition on 4-16-2012 with ISBN 9780300179491. I gave the book 3 stars simply because Amazon requires a star pick."
4,Not a bad price but I'm starting to get errors,"There are literally thousands of choices in the SD memory market so when it comes down to it, you pretty much take a shot in the dark. I tend to stick with known manufacturers, and OCZ is one of them.Initially, the card worked fine and for the most part, it still does, however I get an error message asking me to scan the drive for errors whenever I insert it into any of my SD readers.David"
1,Don't expect too much,"I was really disappointed when I bought this CD...I was expecting really wonderful music (think FFVII & FFVIII), but I was really let down. If you liked the FFVII & FFVIII soundtracks, don't get this one. The music in here is horrible."
4,The right frame of mind.,"I came into this fully knowing this is music for a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game. When compared to other games of this same genre (Everquest, Dark Age of Camelot, etc.), the music is incredible. The music is something you will hear again and again if you play the game, therefore it was made to be unobtrusive and rather simple.Few songs stick out in my mind, mostly the battle themes, as I love the upbeat tempo of them. If you're looking for something of the same high quality as Final Fantasy VII or VIII, this may not work for you. But if you want something that you can put on in the background and not be disturbed, this is perfect."
5,Good Soundtrack,"I have read some of the reviews and decided for myself to listen to this soundtrack and I truly think that it is indeed a good soundtrack. Granted, it's not like most final fantasy soundtrack, but this is an interesting point of view. To explore the different areas of video game music. I glad that I enjoy it and it will be in my collection. Yes, I have plenty of game music and let the beautiful music bring me peace in such a harsh enviroment.Robert"
3,80's Metal to Start the 90's,"I remember when this came out in '89-90...the big-haired dude with the jazz guitar looked like a poor man's C.C. DeVille, and the two supermodel metal queens on the album were just there for the obvious reasons.""Misery's Edge"" was the single and was the best song. The album itself is OK, but not spectacular. Commercial heavy metal, nothing too trashy or unusual, but OK."
1,What the hell,"The last couple of years have been the worst years in music, rap-metal is bloody awful to say the least. Rap music full stop is awful and all this rubbish is being shipped to britain from your bloody country.You need to sit all these 21st artists and say ''imagine what lennon would be thinking if he saw you know''."
1,This is NOT music!,"Ok, when Limp came out with 3 dollar bill, I thought it was cool, Faith was a great song. Then came Nookie which wasnt as good but alright, then came Rollin. This song is Horrible, the cd is horrible. They badly need a new single that will blow us away!"
1,this cd sucks the big one,this album really sucks. limp bizkit had it goin' with 3 dollar bill y'all which was freakin' bad a**. significant other was pretty good. and then there was chocolate starfish and hotdog flavored water. this album sucks. you HAD to be a limp fan to know why this album is worth jack listenin' to. it wasn't hardcore as the first one. they had to mess it up with this soft crap about bein' hated while they WERE at the top of their game. it really sucks. limp bizkit could've done better.
1,Don't waste your money,"This cd is absolutley terrible. I won't waste my time and give the same reasons that everyone else hates it. I want to write limp bizkit to see if I can get my money back. In some way I feel that I got ripped off. Maybe you should buy if you are someone... who doesn't appreciate good music. You know what, that's not even true.. Naw, even then you'd still be wasting your money."
2,Not very good...,"Okay, I was expecting a little more rock and less rap that doesn't even have decent lyrics. Maybe one or two songs were okay, but if your looking for some true rock, go to white zombie or something like that. If you want rap, go to eminem or wu-tang clan. Just please don't buy this. If you really want it, borrow it from a freind first. You'll be returning it the first chance you get."
1,Blame God,This is one of those albums that make you curse God for ever creating a thing called music. Durst should be put to sleep for ever calling himself a musician. This is the extend of his lyrics (say these to yourself in such a high pitched voice that your throat strains and hurts and you'll sound exactly like him): WHY YOU WANNA HATE ME!?! GET THE F UP! CHOCALATE STARFISH!! WHY YOU WANNA HATE ME? WHY's EVERYBODY PICKING ON ME? WHY YOU WANNA HATE ME?!? CAN'T WE JUST GET ALONG? YOU SAY SOMETHING BAD ABOUT ME I'LL HIT YOU!
1,ad nauseam,"How many times can you smash the same E-chord on a detuned guitar and expect to get away with it? Oh yeah, stupid me, you buy a different friggin stompbox/effects rack to make it sound different AND you scream the same cuss words in different order. Now that's original!!Peace.."
1,"IT'S LIMP, ALL RIGHT","I'm aware that the hard rock genre is balancing on a tight rope these days. People are more concerned with the image than they are with the sound. However, I can't understand how anyone could be interested in the whiny, non-musical voice of Fred Durst. When I first heard this guy I thought he was joking. The band may have a future if they kick him out and find someone with talent. To the current hard rock standards, the music is not that bad. It's weak, it's bad--but it's not that bad. Yet if they had any comprehension of the art, Fred Durst would have been gone long ago. You can't take Limp Bizkit seriously. Not worth one star."
1,Oh for the love of god...,"Once again, Limp Bizkit proves that they are just a bunch of sell outs. After ""3 Doller Y'all"" it all just went down hill. If you own this, you problem just heard of Limp Bizkit and don't realize that in a few days, you will be begging to have your ears cut off so that you cant here ""My Generation"" anymore. Just burn it. Burn it to f***ing hell. Limp Bizkit doesn't deserve any airplay at all. F*** Limp Bizkit!!"
2,Fred durst is just wierd,"its strange because the album itself is preety good its just fred durst that puts me off. my generation,my,livin itup,taking a look around and rollin' are good songs but! im taking 2 stars cus of fred durst hes a joke what does he still think nu-metalis alive cus no it died around 3 yrs ago! no1 will ever like limp bizkit ever again because of fred durst thats the reason! we ALL hate him hes stupid pathetic and on tv he gets very arrogant, also sum songs actually suk2 stars-cus of fred durstif fred wasnt in the band it would have been 4 stars"
3,Meh,"This CD is alright, but Significant Other was way better. Wes Borland was kind of right, LB did become a ""sellout band"" in a way. On this CD you can sense them trying to make an easy buck off of some of the songs, and most of the lyrics are downright horrible and laughable, its mostly about Fred Durst not wanting anybody to p*** him off, or him bragging about how Limp Bizkit has the ""hot s***"". Still, LB are a good band, and this is way better than that overrated, overproduced, formula-based Linkin Park crap."
5,Awesome!,"When I first heard this CD in our school cefeteria, I loved it. It is way better uncensored because you can hear everything, not just a bunch of blank spots. This really is a must-hear CD. Also check out Significant Other and 3 Dollar Bill Yall'."
1,"Pure, steamy, crap","ok,what the hell is this? This can't even be considered an album i mean, this has to be the biggest disapointment ever, i bought this thinking it would be ok, but after listening to it i am embarassed to put it in my collection next to sabbath or nirvana,i wouldn't even put this next to my sisters britney spears cd's, an absolute-MUST-NOT-BUY"
2,Terrible,"When I bought Limp Bizkit's first release, 3 Dollar Bill Ya'll I was amazed by their origionality. So of course when they put out Significant other I rushed to the store and bought it. This CD was pretty repetative and the first single, Nookie, was very idiodic but none the less I was still glad I bought it. When I listened to Chocolate Starfish I felt so angry at the stupidity of the album. Every track sounded like one before it. You would like to think frontman Fred Durst is trying to show off how many foul words he knows. I did however like the M:I2 theme song. The bottom line is you should stay away from this CD unless you like a lot of childish lyrics and swearing. Limp Bizkit is just another sell out band that'll die out sooner or later."
5,Great CD form the Bizkit!!!,"HI, this album was great. here are the tracks and there time:intro-1:18 cool introhot dog-3:50 they cuss too much heremy generation-3:41 1st single pretty goodfull nelson-4:07 2 words heavy heavymy way-4:33 this was the 3rd single one of my favs torollin'{air raid vehicle}3:34 the rock version of rollin also the classic also was 2nd singlelivin' it up-4:24 rap heavy song herethe one-3:42 another soft songgetcha groove on-the first minute is some kinda intro to the track then the real song is 4:29 also has xzhibit in ittake a look around-5:18 this is the theme for MI-2it'll be okay-5:06 soft songboiler-5:47 this is the last singlehold on-5:47didyou know there's a good charollete song called thisrollin{urban assult vehical}6:23 this has dmx,method man,and redman in itoutro-2:01 they also have a track 16 where they interview a fanthis was a great album by the bizkit!!! i recommend it"
1,their own guitarist said this sucks....,"yeah, even the band itself cant take it. its sad that this what the music industry has come to. and freddy has the nerve to talk bad about nine inch nails? at least if youre gonna TRY and insult a band a million times better and more original than you, WRITE YOUR OWN LYRICS. oh wait, you cant. oh well, just keep ""rollin' rollin' rollin'""....."
2,This album is kind of crappy,"I used to love Limp Bizkit, Korn, Linkin Park, and those nu-metal rap-rock boybands when I started listening to rock music (3 years ago). Right now I'm 16 and my music taste has developed and grew. Right now I'm into alternative and softer rocks. I don't know, if I have to rate this cd when it came out i would give it a 4 stars, but right now 2 stars seemed a little too much..."
1,should be 0 stars,"This album is bad. Limp is angry, but they have nothing to be angry over. Fred cant rap, he cant sing, and he can't write anything intelligent. The only reason anybody buys this is because it somehow got popular. Shallow people like dumb jocks with low intelligence might enjoy this album. If you want a real rap/metal band get some of the older rage albums. And oh, zack de la rocha's rapping skills is superior to fred durst's."
1,save your money for some *real* music,"i was really looking forward to the release of this cd, and when i finally got it i was *extremely* disappointed. dont get me wrong, im a huge limp bizkit fan, but this is just not anywhere close to the quality of three dollar bill yall$ or significant other. if it was possible for me to give it less than one star i would because theyve gotten so much worse since their debut. pass on this one and buy something that youll listen to all the way through. try some pod or deftones if you like their older stuff, youll be much better off."
4,^_^,"Limp Bizkit's latest, Chocolate Starfish and the Hotdog Flavored Water, is a high energy CD with a rap, rock, futuristic feel. My fave tracks are The One, My Generation, Take a Look Around and I found Outro hilarious once it starts laughing at the end, my friend and I couldn't stop laughing. The lyrics, while not totally deep or profound, fit with Limp Bizkit's style, so if you like rap rock music thats good to groove to, you should like this."
4,Good album,"This album is not as bad as I remember it. I think this is pretty good. The ending songs start to go softer and the Rollin' (Urban Assault Vehicle) song sucks but the album is pretty good. The only song that could have been better was the song ""Hot Dog"". Instrumentally it was good the lyrics just sucked. I didn't like that whole ""F"" word every two seconds thing that was going on there. Other than that, go buy this album if you're into the rock/rap type of music."
1,N'Sync with Guitars,"You know you've reached the pinnacle of musical hypocrisy when you have a VP from Interscope Records rapping a carefully packaged and commerciallized ""angry young man"" line. Overhyped, overplayed and way way overrated. Don't quit your day job Fred."
1,Ummm.. Whatever,"This is by far the CD I most regret buying last year. In fact, the only CD that was worst was Jennifer Lopez's ""On The 6."" In the words of your typical teeny bopper girl I can sum this baby up in one word: EW! If it weren't for Fred Durst's bad boy image, this band would be nothing more than a bunch of derelicts running around cussing. The only song I can stand without wanting to sue them for verbal assualt is ""My Way."" As for the overall feeling of the album, well, we're paying a group of guys to scream profanities at us. If you want good hard care stuff, check out the recordings from the family values tour or Eminem's ""The Marshall Mathers."" These are some CDs that actually are catchy and enjoyable though granted, they're still just screaming at you and/or bashing you and your beliefs."
1,Just Plain Bad.,"I'll make it simple. Limp bizkit is a band who sold out to get known and to sell. Three Dollar Bill will definitely be their best album, they will never top it. The band members lack talent, all Wes knows how to play are power chords, John's drums are awful, all he knows hot to hit are the bass drum and snare drum, Sam's bass, is worser than significant other. Sure, they seem like cool guys, but they need to focus more on their music not focus on making noise elsewhere, make noise, but good noise in the studio. But go ahead and buy this album, you have your own opinions."
1,RAP or ROCK??,"These guys shouldn't even be listed under metal!! Do you remember when ANTHRAX did this kind of music? How about BIOHAZARD?? They sure are singing a different tune now!! This is not metal! How did this band end up here? They should be in the R&B section!! If you listen to this, please don't call yourself a METAL HEAD!! You'll just embarrase the rest of us whol truly listen to metal!!"
2,Same old...same old....,"After reading many reviews that bashed this CD...I had to take a listen for myself...It doesn't seem like LB has grown at all...it's just a continuation of Significant Other...even though some songs like My Way, My Generation, and Rollin' can be catchy...the lyrics and the music itself are not that creative...Fred seems to lack enthusiasm...he doesn't put a lot of thought and energy into this album...it's like he figured that since their last album was so successful, why change anything...well, all artists, no matter how good they are (or think the are), they HAVE to make changes, take chances...that's what the entertainment business is all about...and that is what true lovers of music want......."
1,Could Fred sell out just a little more?,"Honestly, i bought this cd because it was limp bizkit. i bought it the day it came out, and i expected it to be sell-out, rap, trash. And that's what it is. Fred sucks. He used to be cool as hell back in the days of 3 Dollar Bill Ya'll, but this cd just sucks. What ever happened to the scream rock Limp Bizkit used to do? I guess it got smoked with Method Man and Wu Tang. The only good song on this cd is ""Full Nelson"" but it's a blatant rip off of their own, better song, ""Stuck"". I feel sorry for every person who was so in denial when they listened to this cd and tried to pretend they liked it."
4,good stuff!!!,"this limp bizkit album is good,BUT old fans that liked ""three dollar bill""will be dissapointed by it as it strays away from rock to rap though it still has a good beat to it!! people that are just hearing limp bizkit will love it!! so keep on rollin'"
4,Okay... Not Their Best CD... But Okay.,"Three Dollar Bill - cool!Significant Other - Even Better!Chocalte Starfish and the Hotdog Flavored Water - Go back to Three Dollar Bill...This CD isn't as great as their others, Limp Bizkit could have did a lot better. Only if you're a big LB fan, I would suggest it to add on to your collection. Cool Cover, though!"
1,limp talent,"I agree with everyone with this review, (when i say everyone i mean the smart, cool people who say this band sucks). Jee these guys suck so bad. Mix metal and rap and you come up with some bad genre of music called nu metal...korn slipknot, they suck, all show no talent, listen to METALLICA, OZZY, BLACK SABBATH, AC/DC or even nirvana, or children of bodom, theres music worth your time... without metallica or your black sabbaths or your judas preists, you wouldnt be reading this."
3,This was rushed; could have been better,"Significant Other was a rap-rock landmark whether critics know it or not;that album was well put together and thought out. Choclolate Starfish and The Hot Dog Flavored Water was rushed obviously to capitalize on the success of Significant Other. This album does have it's bright spots though; both versions of Rollin', Gimme Watcha Got, My Way, Boiler and the beautifully evil Take A Look Around, their re-interpretation of The Mission Impossibile theme make this a solid buy, but not an overwhelming one."
1,Worst CD ever,"I don't know how a band could get so bad so fast. There last cd was good i thought, But this cd might be the worst cd in the world. What kind of name is ""Chocalat Starfish and hot dog flavored water""? If you bought this cdalready and listened to it i dont think any one in their right mind would by their next cd. Limp Bizkit failed. It really was a great idea for the guitar player to quit. He is way to good for that god awful band"
4,Better than average,"This CD is much softer than the old limp bizkit, however he still manages to write catchy tunes. Livin' it up, Getcha groove on, rolling, my way, my generation, and the rollin' remix are all excellent tracks, but I believe his last cd was much better"
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE,his old stuff was good but now he just tried to over do it and just plain ... this may be very short but there is not much to describe when the cd is PLAIN JUNK.
4,Great CD,"This CD is well worth the money. It is very good and there is more than the two good songs that you have heard so far. The Cd is very good. I really enjoy it. Of course the best songs are ""My Generation"" and ""Rollin'"" but there are two ""Rollin'""'s on the CD. One is the original and the other is one done with Method Man, Red-Man, and DMX. That song also is very good. Great CD. A great purchase. Well worth it. You will love it if you like Limp Bizkit."
3,Limp Bizkit,"This was an okay cd. I think Significant Other was way better. I was expecting more of a Rock type of CD instead I got Rap, a disappointment. There are a few good tracks such as Rollin, My Generation, and Take a Look around but that's all there is as for hits, if there gonna put out another single it's gonna be a lemon! I only bought it because I knew Rollin/My Generation/and take a looke around are awsome songs, but that's all when Significant Other you can pop the CD in and it would have one good song after another, this CD you have to skip around for good songs! Hot Dog is a hilarous song though as long as it doesn't offend you!"
4,Fred Could have done better,"Don't get me wrong this album is damn good except for the fact that you get pretty tired of the lyrics after a while.The music by Wes,Sam,Otto and Lethal is the best but Fred screwed up with the way he wrote the lyrics.Every other word in the songs is F--. I hope that in the next album Fred gets his act straight and writes some better stuff and doesn't just swear every other word.If you are new to Limp Bizkit and want to buy one of their albums buy Significant Other beacuse that is definitely better and you can't get bored with that."
3,They can't do what they did with three dollar bill...,Limp Bizkit's new cd is nothing to be to proud of.They have gone towards being more of a rap band then a metal band.If you are true fan you will buy and not like it as much as the others.But for a first time buyer of this band I would not advise you to buy this record.
4,Bizkt at its Best,"I think Chocolate Starfish and Hot Dog flavored water is an excellent Cd I think it is better than Signficant Other, but no quite as good as Three Dollar Bill y'all. Some of the tracks our excellent, such as the beats of Livin' it up and the slow but very nice song, Hold on with Scott Weiland. There is Getcha Groove on which grows on you much like its brother ... did. And the urban assault version of Rollin is very catchy with method man back and DMX. This is a very good CD, I defientlely recommend buying it."
3,A man rises up to lead the masses...,"True to Marxist doctrine, a supreme being will rise up amongst the proletariat to lead us all to a better communal life. And that time is now, as comrade Fred Durst exemplifies the best of Lenin, Chairman Mao, and Generalissimo Fidel Castro in his new, cryptically-titled release ""Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog-Flavored Water"" (a euphemism for communism). Pay close attention to the dogma-laden track ""Rollin (Urban Assault Vehicle)"" as Chairman Durst peppers the listener with a frenzy of staccato-paced communist diatribe. Once you go red, you never go back, baby.Customers who bought this also bought:A lobotomy"
4,They'll never change,Limp Bizkit is still a pretty good band. But from their first release to this one they have not changed at all. Fred Durst still make that funny voice and their Rap/Rock style is still the same. If you're a Limp Bizkit fan I recomend U buy this Cd. It's not all that different but it has some new songs for you to listen to.
1,What happened between Sig. Other and this?,"How could they have worked on this so long and still made one of the worst CD's ever? Another question, why are people still buying this? Don't get me wrong, I like the new Rap-Rock thing going on but this is just dumb. I felt liking falling asleep listening to this! I just about threw this piece of garbage in the trash but then my friend asked if she could have it...two days later she threw it away! If you bought it already, throw it away, go grab a good Alice in Chains or Godsmack CD and listen to a GOOD band. If you haven't bought this, STAY AWAY!"
1,Not Worth the Price of a Bizkit,"Horrible - the first word that pops into my head. This CD is a combination of lack of talent, lack of inspiration, and lack of quality. There is no continuity to the album. You may have a song that seems to give life to the CD then the next song makes you wonder how they ever got a record contract. Please spend your money somewhere else. I would rather spend my money on an extra copy of a Matchbox 20 CD than to get this garbage."
5,Like u can do it better,"Seriously, every man and his own thingI personally like the cd, i think its real good, (it'll be okay, is my favorite)really expressing their feelings about the not-good side of life, backstabbing, not letting people mess with u, love-hate kinda pain.This album is openminded and gives u a brider look of life.I dont understand why everyone's critizing Fred Durst, so what if u dont think he can rap or whatever, if u dont like it then dont listen to it."
1,I'd rather listen to the Aflac duck sing Christmas carols...,"...then subject myself to this a$$ clown parade known as limp bizkit. There are much better things life has to offer, like prison food..."
1,What mental hospital did they come from???????!!!!!!,"I hate Fred Durst. All I even listened to were a few samples of songs from this CD, and instantly, I thought of calling the police. No, not really, but I did think of shooting myself because my brain had instantly been forever poisoned by this trash. Honestly, I at least gave the album 1 star because the band isn't horrible. It's Fred Durst I hate!!!!! Click on 'yes' if you agree with me. If you click 'no', uh, then I don't wanna know you....."
5,Another great Bizkit album!,"Limp Bizkit again proves that they are ever evolving with their new release Chocolate Starfish and the Hotdog Flavored Water,this album is relevant as a hip-hop and rock cd equally,Freds vocals rock,pick it up it's a great CD."
4,better than expected,"In the wake of his success we all know that Fred Durst has grown to be about the cockiest musician around. This for some will be reason enough to pass up this album but I would like to say that despite the drastic change from their older style this album is very good and stands alone as a good rock/rap album. Yes, this disk is very different from their earlier work, but, it is hard to improve without change isn't it? If you get this disk and listen to it without expecting something else it WILL grow on you, however if you jump from their first C.D. to this one you will be sadly disapointed by the disappearance of the rock theme and the emergence of the rap theme. But as I said listen to it and you'll learn to like it on its own merits. If nothing else GIVE IT A CHANCE."
1,Stupidity on a CD!,This CD is the stupidest thing I ever heard. Limp Bizkit is just another MTV band. The lyrics are idiotic and the music sucks. My brother likes this stuff. He doesn't know anything about real rock music. He says that LB is the best band. He listens to rap anyway. Then he goes to dissing Nirvana. That's totally ridiculous. I wouldn't waste any money on Limp Bizkit. All they care about is money. They suck. Don't buy this.
1,OH DEAR LORD...MINUS INFINITY STARS,"this is actually my dimise that i'm actually on this reveiw. i cant even begin to comprehend how bad this album is so i just say three things: ""------WORST-----ALBUM-------EVER------"" :yes you know it, so lets take a vote""yes"" if you think this is the ""------WORST-----ALBUM-------EVER------""""no"" your a sad indiviual how needs to geta brain!!"
1,COMPLETE GARBAGE,"THIS ALBUM PRETTY MUCH SUMS UP MODERN MUSIC:TRASH TRASH AND MORE TRASH. MIXING RAP AND ROCK IS AN INSULT TO MUSIC AND FURTHERMORE, THE PROFANITY ON THIS ALBUM ISNT EVEN FUNNY AND MAKES THE LYRICS 20 TIMES MORE CHILDISH THAN THEY REALLY ARE, AWFUL VOCALIST, AWFUL MUSIC ENSEMBLE. \, ITS EVEN WORSE THAN KID ROCK AND OR KORN. DONT BUY THIS."
5,Chocolate Starfish And The Hot Dog-flavored Water,"Limp Bizkit is the coolest band out there now. So naturally their CD would rock, but this album is totally my favorite so far. Rollin' and My Generation are my favorite songs in the CD. So I totally say that everyone should buy this album!!!"
5,AWSOME CD. LIMP SOUNDS SOLID,"Limp Bizkit sounds phat on this cd. Even though Fred is still rapping, he does a great job at it. Wes sounds real good with his new PRS guitar. Lethal does an awsome job in my generation full nelson. Johns drumming kicks like always. And Sam is just plain awsome on bass. This CD beats the pants off the toehr two(well mayby not the first but defibitely the second). BUY IT!"
5,This CD wreaks of awesomeness!!!!!!!!!!!,"This CD rules!!!!! I was expecting something that had more rap-type songs but it's not like that at all. All of the songs are great. I'm listening to it right now and I can't help but bob my head to the music. It's evident by a lot of the songs the Fred Durst poured his soul into some of these songs and songs like ""my generation"" can serve as an anthem for kids everywhere."
2,"I've now grown old of Bitz Climpkit, oh, Limp Bizkit.","Who does Fred Durst think he is? I've now changed. Limp Bizkit is the BEST BAND EVER! NOT! Ever heard of Linkin Park, KoRn or Drowning Pool? Or even Pantera, SlipKnot, Coal Chamber, Ill 'Nino or Sevendust? They are way better than Limp Bizkit. Limp Bizkit: SELL-OUTS! The songs: My Way, Rollin'(Air Raid), My Generation and Take A Look Around are the only songs that have any talent. But, they have two good albums. Give Significant Other and Three Dollar Bill a chance. Limp Bizkit were once one of the best. Now they're just awful. Pick up a Drowning Pool or KoRn album."
4,Meow,"Ok, people complain about his lyrics. Yes he's not a good writer. That's obvious. But you have to think about the people who actually listen to his words. He's a good writer to those who listen to his words. I honestly don't care for his words either but overall, the beats of the lyrics, the guitar riffs, the drum beats it all comes together to make alot of good tracks on this cd. If you are looking for a good lyrical band try Smashing Pumpkins or Our Lady Peace. But I love this cd, not for it's lyrics but for the music overall. Sure, they're not my favorite band and it probably might have alot to do with the lyrics and Fred Durst himself. But that's not what's important. Just listen to it. It's a good cd."
4,"They may be posers, but they are the best of the genre.","As much as I hate Fred, I just gotta give it to this band because I haven't heard another rock/rap band that can stack up to this one except Linkin Park. Yes, Fred's lyrics are pointless and really show off his ego. Yes, there is an infinite amount of cuss words on this cd. And yes, they are posers. But a lot of these songs just sound so good that I can't stop listening, and I'm not gonna deny that. These guys are good at what they do and I like to listen to them, not get into their personal lives. Just don't expect well written lyrics if you buy this album.Highlights are: ""Livin it up"", ""Hot Dog"", ""Full Nelson"" and ""My Generation""."
1,I remember when I had this..,I remember I was in the 9th grade I walked all the way to Bestbuy just to buy this album which the distance from Bestbuy to my place at the time was a very long walk. I was a big Limp Bizkit fan in my 8th grade year thought they were the best band out there. Now that I have grown up and look back it's like man how in the world can you like this stuff? It's just terrible.. I threw away this cd along with all my other Limp Bizkit cd's awhile back ago. Now I still like alittle bit of material off there first 2 albums I'm not going to lie there good songs when you want to listen to something just for the kick and that don't really mean anything. But the lyrics on most Limp Bizkit songs are just pointless and real childish it is pathetic. Well I didn't want to give this cd 1 star but I had to. to Do not get this CD if you must get something Limp Bizkit get Three Dollar Bill Or Significant Other but even those albums after awhile will start to become pointless.
1,Bad...,This album suck like a PoP Mc Hammer album but with electric guitard and a real drum. Get your copy..... and put that crap in the garbage!
2,It gets old (2 stars),"Edit:Ok, I give this 2 stars for the number of good songs: ""Boiler"" and ""Take A Look Around"". All other songs here are bad."
2,It just keeps getting worse,"Don't get me wrong, I like the bizkit, but Significant and Starfish should've been combined into one album with all the crap left off. You wanna know what I never liked about rap? Rap albums have 2 trendy songs and the rest of the songs are filler - a bunch of cliches and songs about how tough the singer is. In that regard, this is a true rap album. Fred ruins perfectly good songs by singing stupid lyrics that you can't sing along with. Yet I like this album enough that I still listen to it. Go figure. Oh, and what is this about 2 discs? Did everyone else get 2 discs? I am trying to find my case to see if I someone didn't notice it was a 2-disc set because I never noticed before."
2,Limp bizkit has lost there way,"I loved Limp bizkit i nthe days of three dollar bill ya'lll and half the songs oof of signifigant other but what is this! it seems like a poser rappers album the only reason i didn't rate it one star is theres one or 2 decent songs but thats it, i feel that Lb is going down the mainstream road and it pisses the sh*t out of me they had so much potential! and im dissapointed in them.No wonder Wes left the band he wanted to rock he wanted to play metal!!!!!! SO fred stop worrying about britney spears and go back to your roots."
2,ummm alright,"Alright my favirote song on here would have to be My Way. Probably because I can relate to it. My generation is a good song,but you can tell it was aimed towards teenagers. I like the music but it could use better lyrics. Rollin,is a good song for dancing too but besides that its dorky. The only reason I like hot dog is because it reminds me of a friend. Otherwise I do not really care for it. The other songs are dull."
3,NOT the bizkits best album...,"this cd was okay, but the songs arent as 'meaningful or thoughtful' as significant other or three dollar bill y'all. if you have dollars to spare buy this cd. if you dont, dont."
3,Limp Bizkit...Choco Starfish,"I felt that i enjoyed this album at first, however i feel the more i listened to it the more i began to dislike it. I wouldnt recomend this album to anyone unless they want to pay money for only a few good tracks. I particularilly enjoy listening to track 7...""Livin It Up"" also known as ""Life In The Fast Lane""."
4,Not as good as the last,"I have been a Limp Bizkit fan since their first album. I have to say although this album is very good I think ""significant other"" was much better. I love to see a band that can improve on their sound and songs from one album to the next but in this case I think they need to try a little harder.This time around I found myself skipping at least 3 to 4 tracks because frankly they are just bad. Significant other still remains my favorite LB CD and it will be the one that all other LB CDs will be judged."
1,Hands down the worst album ever made...steer clear!!!!,"This album is terrible, there's really no other word for it. The production is WAY too overpolished, the lyrics have no quality whatsoever (unless you count vulgarity as ""quality""), and the songs are poorly written and arranged. My dog can write better songs. This will appeal to all you ""angst- ridden"" 15 year old kids who have yet to discover REAL music yet. This album gets one star, and only because I feel bad for Wes Borland, obviously the only real talent in the band, even though he can't let it show. Hopefully this will be the last Limp Bizkit album, because this is by far the biggest waste of plastic and paper ever, and I dont see how they can get any worse. Fred Durst says, ""Its my way or the highway,"" and the latter is the only answer."
4,kiss my starfish,"This is my review of the songs on this records 1: Not bad 4 an intro 2:Humorous, and has a good beat to it 3:Good for this this type of song 4:One of the best ones here 5:Second Best 6:):):):) (in case u didn't know, those were 4 smiles) 7:good 8:I didn't know until 2 min., but this is great 9:cool, but a close call 10:im a m-i fan, so i loved this 11:freaky 12: The Best 13:not much here 14: VERY KOOOL 15: Has a monotonous voice for 3 min. still funny(the voice is a laugh)"
4,Full of Limp Bizkit adrenaline!,"Being a Limp Bizkit fan, I am surprised to say that this album isn't as interesting to listen to as their previous album. ""Rollin'"" is full of energy, but the lyrics just doesn't hit me in the heart as well as many of their previous songs. ""getcha groove on"" is has that tune to keep you repeating it over and over in your mind. I enjoyed ""my generation"" the most. Over all it is a fantastic CD to listen to, especially for Limp Bizkit fans. I play this CD every night before I go to sleep, soothing to the soul. =)"
2,Hmmm..........,"Well.....this CD could have been better and it could have been worse. Some of the songs are tight some suck. To me, this CD was played out before it was actually released. I think I've heard ""Rollin'"" and ""My Generation"" about 100 times each. I don't have a favorite song on this CD, but I can listen to whole thing. Overall I was kinda disappointed because I had heard rumors that LB was going more back to their ""3 Dollar Bills Y'All"" roots which proved false. I would like to see Fred and the boys really dig deep and come up with some classics like ""Counterfeit"" and ""Sour"". Fred needs to decide if he's a rapper or a rocker. He's trying to hard to intergrate the two."
1,Total [Junk},"Hey everybody, lets get a hit album and not do anything new and innovative and stay in the same pile of crap. $3 Bill was a great CD, but Limp's records have gone downhill since then. ... . Anyways, Durst's ""lyrics"" are more like he's trying to get slogans and not say anything important at all. I will give the band credit because they rock, but they need to lose the dead weight of Durst to get a credible lead singer or maybe even an MC with real skills."
3,Alright,"Can't say that I am a big fan of Limp Bizkit, but some of their songs are ok. Some are completely horrible. Hot dog is a crappy song but the rest didn't seem as bad as some of the reviews I read. So I am going to go 50-50 with this album."
1,I RATE NEGATIVE INFINITY STARS!!!,"PPL THINK THEIR SO COOL JUST CUZ THEY LISTEN TO MUSIC WITH A BUNCH OF CUSS WORDS!!! I CAN STAND CUSS WORDS, I DONT REALLY CARE! BUT SOME PPL OVERDO IT!!! AND 'WIMP'BIZKIT DEFINITELY DOES THAT! AND THEY SUCK BAD!!! ALL THOSE PPL SAYING THEIR THE BEST, QUIT WASTING YOUR MONEY! AND MOST OF ALL THEY R NOT ORIGINAL! PLAGUERISM (however u spell it) IS WRONG, AND TOO MANY DO IT! SO IF UR GONNA GET A CD GET ANY EXCEPT THIS ONE!!! or any of their others"
4,THIS IS GOOD,"Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavoured Water is actually a good album.C'mon,why did so many people criticise it when Bizkit couldn't have done nothin' better.People who were ctiticisin''em for language shouldn't give a damn about language and it ain't got nothin' to do with 'em so don't open your mouths without gettin' yer facts right.There ain't no more to say really,but you've gotta hear all the songs before you can make a judgement on 'em,and who gives a damn about language.L"
4,Why It's so big deal?,"Well i was Reading the reviews and I kind of surprise how terrible can be the antipathy could have some people with this band.Well I'm not a big fan, I really like the second and this album, I like how they sound, I like the energy that they proyect, The first album kind of good but not enough, But since West Borland is not anymore ..the things I guess is going down with this band, and no matter what Fred Durst can do....but I don't think that himself will put his band in the level of the second and the third album again.... or who knows..."
1,"Cum On, Try Somethin' Better","Rap and Heavy Metal, everybody said it wouldn't mix. But it did and this album isn't the best example of Rap/Metal. Limp Bizket are what kids call ""Posers"", Thinkin' that their cool even though their lyrics are cheap, Immature, and completly stupid. i can remeber when i was like 8 or 9 i thought the song ""Rollin"" was the coolest song ever. Now that i'm older and i am into more music i know a good song when i hear one and ""Rollin"",""My Way"", ""My Generation"" don't fit the cut. Also if you listen the same riff is used one more than 1 song. (Which isn't wrong at least if the song is different.) Bands like Anthrax and Rage Against the Machine (Now i see why that guy jumped on stage at the VMA's for they rightfully won the award unlike these guys) would be ashmed to hear where their legacys have ended up. Anthrax were the first to do rap/metal, Rage Against the Machine perfected it, and Limp Bizket destroyed it."
4,Something good to say about Limp Bizkit,"As i read through the reviews on Limp Bizkit's Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water, I was disappointed to see all the negative reviews. I own this CD and I really enjoy the music. I might not be trying to pull some deep meaning out of the lyrics to ""Rollin"" or ""My way"" but I know that when I put on the starfish CD, I want to dance and sing along and I have fun listening to it. And isn't that the description of good music?"
5,limp bizkit presents there best album ever,this by far is the best limp bizkit album ever. i had bought signiikent other when it first came out and loved it. so when chocolate starfish came out i rushed to buy it. Even though it has a PARENTAL ADVISORY on it doesn't really matter. i would still recomend ages 13 and up to buy this cd. other wise it's the best cd of 2000!
5,Awesome CD,This album is by far Limp Bizkits best cd yet the songs are awesome and i listen to it 24/7 if u like Limp Bizkit pick this up right now for the kids with strict parents get the edited version but this album is totally awesome from rollin to hotdog and all the other tracks great album.
2,There is better stuff than this,"Nothing like 3 dollar Bill. This CD was put out just for fame, it was all just thrown together, 3 chords per song, same lyrics. If you want to listen to some quality rock that has a meaning I would recommend some bands like TOOL, Filter, Nine Inch Nails, Or A Perfect Circle. Maybe Korn."
2,Fred Durst ruins what should be have been a great record!!,"Durst's ego has embarased everyone in the rock communtiy and is destroying the future of his talented band. Limp's past two albums had both great music and good vocals but on starfish Durst's lyrics are laughable at best. Fred what the hell happened to you. You gone from a great frontman to a wannabe, rapper. No thought at all is put into freds lyrics and the course of HOT DOG is about a dumb as fred can get. Musically the albumn is great as Wes and co, crank out great tunes only to ruined by freds, cristina aguleria due, macho, total lack of talent lyrics. I hope limb break up and Wes and Co. find a real frontman. FRED RUINED LIMP BIZKIT!"
4,The best limp so far,"I just got this CD an hour ago, and it is the best Limp Bizkit yet! Great job on this cd... seems to be a lot like ""Significant Other"", only even greater! A Must Have for all hard rock fans."
4,Good Album But Falls Short Of A Good Limited Edittion CD,"This album is okbut not worth the money for two bonus trax, pick up the regular one and save yourself some money"
5,Limps New One Rocks!!!,"I luv this album it rules and my fav songs are, hot dog, getcha groove on and rollin but i like many more. Limp really did a good job and i am also going to get the limited editetion with eminem on it. THIS CD IS WORTH EVERY PENNIE I SPENT ON IT. Rock on Limp!!If you didn't like this album check out their pervious releases:Three Dollar Bill Yall$ andSignificant other"
1,Oh my...,"What astounds me is that Three Dollar Bill is so ... good, but Significant Other is so mediocre and Limp (more Fred than anything) decides to follow that mediocrity with an even [worse] CD! For one, the melodies and notes are too disjointed to sound proper, he tries to maintain this tough-guy image with hard and drawn-out riffs with rough vocals and also (for some odd reason) this sensitive guy image ... where he tries somehow to mix melodic soft singing with his completely inept singing voice... (...buy the CD just to cringe over his obnoxiously horrible vocals...)He's making himself into what he used to hate: a fake. ..."
1,Pure Garbage,"I NEVER liked Limp Bizkit. In fact, the ONLY reason I bought this cd is because a friend of mine said that it was ""the best thing Limp Bizkit has ever done."" Boy, what a load of crap that was! This cd perfectly displays how Limp Bizkit was one of rock/metal's biggest mistakes. It's a pure disgrace to know that KoRn, the most important band in metal history in my opinion, discovered these [guys]. The music that Limp Bizkit plays on here is as always, repetitive and bland. Fred Durst doesn't even attempt to sing on here. Why bother? We've all heard him try to sing, and he just plain [not good]! And also, the constant use of the f-word is just kind of immature. REAL musicians don't find it necessary to constantly use profanities in their songs. Avoid this cd at all costs. Nothing on this cd is worth anyone's time."
1,the outro rules,the only good thing about this album is the outro. the other songs are terrible. there is some good riff potential but it is ruined by dj lethal's syncopated scratch rythms.
2,Sold Out,"Well, the Limp Bizkit started out as a [great] band, but unfortunately they ended that with a turn to something not as cool. Rap is not Fred Durst's forte, and his use of it on their third ""effort"" has lost him a lot of fans. The music that used to be the mook metal of ""Significant Other"" has degraded into a typical rap album. Where Durst used to write real lyrics, the newer songs (save a few lucky good ones like ""Take A Look Around"" and ""It'll Be Ok"" plus Scott Weiland's ""Hold On"") are mostly the rap standard, ""be cool, keep it real, and don't get in my way or I'll ... beat you down into a mushy pulp. But stay cool."" Sad really, their first album they were just having fun. The second album they were selling out and having fun, this one is just media puppet, TRL sellout stuff. Good Luck on the fourth album."
3,This one kinda [stinks],"the first 2 albums were definetely 5 stars but this one isnt that great... the only good songs are boiler, it'll be ok, the one and getcha groove on...rollin is way overplayed...i dunno i was just hoping for a better album"
2,should've stuck with what worked,"this was a major dissappointment. their previous cd was much better. only my way, take a look around and rollin' make this cd worth listining to. it seems limp thinks if they use the ""f"" word more than 100 times on the cd then people will like it more. what the heck is up with hotdog? they were right when they called it a ""f-ed up rhyme""."
2,Enjoyable as long as you don't pay alot of attention to it..,"This is one of those albums you could only enjoy while you're doing something else and not really paying much attention. They have some catchy rythms but come on, how much time did it take to come up with lines like ""keep on rollin' rollin' rollin'...""? And the fact that they had two songs based on that line was just downright sad. The lyrics aren't really going anywhere...or coming from anywhere for that matter. They're kinda just there for the sake of filling up some empty space although I believe they would have been better off making this album purely instrumental. If you're gonng listen to this album, read a magazine or watch TV to occupy your mind or you'll be hitting the skip button alot. ...But then again, I never really was a Limp Bizkit fan...."
2,Overrated..not best work,"When I heard of Limp Bizkit recording the next CD a couple of months before the release, I was excited about what it would sound like. I then heard the two singles released and seen the video on MTV (Rollin' and My Generation).. I have come to a conclusion that these are the best songs on the album.Anyways, after buying the CD, I literally was ""burned out"" on it only a couple of weeks later. In my opinion, I think that this album was more quickly put together with less effort then the first two albums. Plus, I think that it can become very tiring, very quickly. I cannot stand to listen to Rollin' anymore!!Before spending 20 bucks of your hard earned money on this album, I say, buy the first two CD's, and just download both versions of Rollin' and My generation and you will have Limp Bizkit's best work.(A little hint that the album was just put together quickly, they included the Mission Impossible theme which had already been released on that movie soundtrack.)"
4,tight!,"This is a good albume and i think all limp bizkit fans would like it. Favorite songs are rollin, rollin remix, my generation, and get your groove on featuring xzibit!buy this u wont be dissapointed!!!!"
4,GOOD ROCK ALBUM THAT IS PERFECT FOR BIZKIT FANS,"I know that Fred Durst is a dick and their music is dying down but this is a really cool album. Whether it's the hard 'rollin' or the catchy 'the one' this really is the best album that the bizkit have realeased. Forget about the new RESULTS MAY VARY, this is the album that showed the world that they could rock."
1,absolute abomination....,"Wow Fred Durst is totally full of himself on this one. He's got the world by the throat, he's got the chicks he always wanted, he's got total control over his bandmates.... what he doesn't have, though, is a good record. The filth of commercial music is spilt all over this one, and it oozes of the reek of putrefaction. Terrible, tasteless arrangements, the most patronizingly annoying voice ever recorded (kudos to mr. limp, fred durst), no talent, pure monotony and endless repetition. I mean, if you don't have any riffs, don't play em over and over. You people should listen to Megadeth or something..."
1,upset mom,"I can't believe that this is allowed to be publicized. My son is 13 years old and wanted this CD! Not in my life time or his will he ever get such a disgraceful, foul mouth so called piece of music. Limp bisket you need Christ in your life."
2,Significant Other part II?,"Wait, didn't I just hear this album? Oh, that's right. This one's new. Fred Durst and his bandmates certainly have pulled off another one, and when I say ""another"" I really mean ""another album that they know before it hit the shelves that it will go at least triple platinum."" A GREAT EXERCISE IN BS AND GIVING THE MASSES EAR CANDY INSTEAD OF REALLY TRYING TO GO SOMEWHERE WITH THEIR MUSICALITY, WHICH IS ACTUALLY PRETTY ORIGINAL.Also, the songs on this album are WAY overproduced. There isn't a second in ""Rollin'"" where I don't hear Fred Durst saying something. Hey Fred, here's a tip: SHUT UP! LET THE MUSIC SAY SOMETHING FOR ONCE! WE DON'T HAVE TO HEAR YOUR VOICE EVERY SECOND OF THE ALBUM!"
1,Trash,"Pathetic, meaningless songs. I could give a crayon to 2 year olds and get better lyrics. This is not metal, this is barely rap-core. Void of melody or talent. Stay as far away as possible from this CD. Want quality metal? Try In Flames or Children of BOdom, just stay as far away as possible from this CD.""Adidas, rapping, angsty lyrics, samples, funky grooves, screaming, ad nauseum. Stand in line, you know the drill. More spokes off the hub that Korn have wrought, and to a lesser extent, the Deftones, whose utter superiority to this cack is so obvious I just have to laugh. And laugh I will. You see, rap music is that airheaded kid that sat at back of your classroom, popular, but vacant, and damn difficult to ignore because he was so obnoxious. Lyrical analysis is futile though, sorta like perusing mattress tags for an iambic sonnet. But don't mind me, 'cause this will sell like justice for the rich. If you like your Korn-metal with an odious rap husk, well, there it is."""
1,I have a question,"Who's worse?Limp Bizkit or the 6 million Americans for buying this album and making them so popular. Lets face it, in their heyday you all loved them really. Thanks for letting another excuse for music pollute the world America."
1,Can't call this metal.,This album is awful. I could play better guitar riffs than borland. Fred Durst should be in a sitcom. The old dude on the decks needs to realise that the eighties were a while ago. Limp BIzkit is POP music.
1,Alright... Limp Bizkit Is Now Officially ...,"I used to like LB... i didnt like their first album cuz im into rap and it wasnt rap at all... Significant Other was good, their best in my opinion. So, when I heard that DMX, XZIBIT, METHODMAN, and da funk doctah spock himself, REDMAN were all on dis album i thought itd be a pretty good buy... I was wrong. Limp Bizkit is gone pretty much beyond repair... im really gonna miss songs like ""nookie"" and ""break stuff""... but whut to do? this CD is realllllly bad. i mean it. it aint heavy at all... it cant be true rock and it ain't HIP HOP/RAP AT ALL! whut da hell iz dis... basically DONT BUY IT unless u want a really good laugh. Go buy Jay-Z's new album the Blueprint cuz thats a tight album.PEACE"
4,Solid Album,"This was a pretty good album by Limp Bizkit. This album was the peak of limp's success.The songs were well writed except there was way too much profanity. I dont mind hearing ""F-This"" or ""F-That"" every now and then but Fred over did it a little. They didn't need to curse so much to be successful because ""My Way"" and ""Boiler"" are great songs with minimal cursing.Every song on this album is worth listening to. My generation and Rollin are real good hits. As is ""Getcha Groove On"". I normaly hate it when bands associate with rappers but this is the one case where ill make an exception. The vocals and beat couldn't be any better.The only downfall to this album is the overused profanity and they went a little bit on the softside, breaking away with 3 Dollar Bill.Overall i recomend this to people who dont mind frequent use of profanity and who like good frat-boy rock."
3,OK,"Rollin and My Generation are fair, but ""The One"" sounds so much like Re-Arranged it's ridiculous. Their other two albums are so much better. Don't listen to all the others who think they have to follow pop culture and immediatly give this album 5 stars and say "" LIMP BIZKIT ROCKS YO"" Try to listen to someone else's copy before you buy it yourself to see if you like it."
1,Thieves,"Limp Biscuit stole the song ""See Emily Play"" from Pink Floyd, put in their own lyrics, called it ""My Way"" and you're just going to let it happen? I'm not."
1,if...,"If you want metal, buy a Pantera cd. If you want rap, buy a Snoopcd. If you want [expletive deleted], buy this cd. Nuff said."
1,just plain horrible,"Buying this album was quite possibly the biggest mistake i have ever made, and ive made quite a few mistakes in my life. This shouldn't even be considered music, I don't even know why im bothering to write a review on this, i shouldn't be spending any time even thinking about this album. This is just pathetic, how can they live with themselves knowing that they make such horrendous ""music""?"
2,"In Response to ""The Greatest Album of All Time""","You have got to be some 12 yearold wigger that is impressed by someone who likes to use profaine language. I'm glad that you admire him for cursing freely in his songs, cause that makes him soo cool. This is what's wrong with today's youth. Learn how to write an intelligent review and then maybe people will take your opinion seriously. I gave this CD 2 stars. One for ""Rollin' Air Raid Assualt"" and another for ""Rollin' Urban Assault Vehical"". Fred Durst is nothing but a huge wigger and trys to rap when he sounds like garbage. Maybe when he learns that his skin color is white and stops trying to rap, I'll listen to him."
1,hate it hate it hate it hate it!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this is the biggest piece of worthless bull$#!& I've ever heard in my entire life!!!!!!!! Fred Durst can s**k it!!!!!!!!!! I hate Limp bizkit and I hate every d**n thing they stand for!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Fred Durst is the biggest piece of f***in' s*** on the planet and he needs to go home and shut the f**k up for once in his life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh, hell, let's just see how far these idiots get before somebody shoots them!!!!!!!!! I hope they all f***** die!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ha ha ha ha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,not terrible,but the problem i have with this recording is there is nothing on it that wasn't already on significant other. it's just basically the same and doesn't sound new. the lyrics are stupid.
1,PURE MINDLESS DRIBBLE!!!,"I look back at the day i bought this album and shudder with fear, DO NOT EVER THINK ABOUT BUYING THIS ALBUM NOT EVEN AS A JOKE, IT SHALL COME BACK TO HAUNT YOU."
1,....Fred durst is my hero!,"Fred Durst is my coz he swears like a mutherf#@ker!.See,i can f#@king swear to!.WOW!. well f#@k me,you think they will hire me coz i can f#@king swear all the f#@king time??This is weird,I can't seem to think of any other f#@king words to f#@king say coz all i can do is f#@king swear all the f#@king time!!F#@KING WOW! :-D...actualy,you know what,i think i might just stick to actual music instead..yeh,sounds like a plan.....ZERO F#@KING STARS!..SORRY FREDDY BOY!....oh,look at the time,don't you have you're headjob appointment with your best bum chums Korn?.."
1,END THE INSANITY!,"Limp Bizkit....what is there to say? They were so promising, so talented, and sold out so early. If any of you actually remember their first album Three Dollar Bill Yall then you know what I am talking about. They have gone from that, to okay(Signifigant Other), to okay just leave with some dignity guys (Chocolate Starfish and whatever the hell it is). If you want to do something useful with your twenty bucks or whatever the inflated price of this junk is buy a few happy meals for the poor, LB doesn't need any more money to inflate their already sickening ego."
1,What a joke...,Notice how those who gave this senseless drivel 5 stars usually can't spell or write grammatically correct sentences.
4,Very Very Good but not the best,"Ok. This cd is very very good but its not the best. There best Cd is Three Dollar Bill Y'all$ by far, but anyways this Cd is very good and I recommend it for anyone especially hardcore Limp fans. I got this Cd outta Fan Devotion but even if I wasnet a huge limp fan i still woulda got this Cd ,its awesome not too much rap or too much screaming its just perfect."
5,Limp are back,WOW. LIMP BIZKIT ARE BACK AND EVEN BETTER. THIS IS DA BEST CD I'VE EVER HEARD. THIS IS ONLY SUITABLE FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE LIMP BIZKIT
1,Limpp BIZZKIT rawk and rollll,"Where there is a party, there is rawk and rollll. And where there is rawk and rollll, there is limpp bizzkit. May the parties be joyous and the biscuits be limp."
1,hilariously bad juvenile delinquent stuff,"this was the first cd I got back in 6th grade, and boy did I think it was funny. I mean, the guy sings the ""f-word"" about 50+ times in one song, so whats not to like, right? well, other than the fact that I ""grew up"" and listened to better music later on, this isn't that bad. well, unless you are older than a 6th grader. then it sucks. and boy, this album sucks. basically everything wrong with music today can be traced to this album. its that bad. its funny as heck, but this is terrible music. it is worth a novelty listen if you want to be cracked up a bit, but other then that its garbage. and Fred Durst trying to do slower emotional songs at the end is just a complete joke. avoid this cd and their others like the plague."
1,todays music is crap,"is it just me or has todays music totally gone down the tubes, not all of it but most of it. Weve got a bunch of copycat pop singers who cant sing, weve got a little white rapper wining in every lyric and bashing people who arent like him, and then this brings me to limp bizkit themselves. the rap/core crap.Limp bizkit's latest crap-o-rama is just the same as their previous one, a bunch of loud wining that the mtv generation loves, i hate my generation of music, all it is now is how many t-shirts and posters a group can sell, its lost all of the heart it once had back in the 60's, 70's, some 80's and early to mid 90's but in the 2000's music is just plain crap.So if you have limp bizkits previous one dont bother with this one because your getting the same thing."
1,This is horrible,"This CD is the worst thing I have heard in a long time. I would give it zero stars if I could. It makes Significant Other (another crappy CD) sound like a masterpiece. Every song on here is worse then the one before it. I think Fred Durst spent too much time trying to get on Christina Aguluiar (sic), when he should have spent time thinking up decent lyrics. All the songs either sound like ""Nookie"" or ""Rearranged."" The one good thing about this CD is Wes Borland's guitar work. He needs to leave the band. [...] There is no way I would pay money for this"
1,I Hate My Generation,"I don't know... I guess I just feel bad for people who think this is good music. Yeah, I'm a music snob, but you have to be in this day and age. I'm afraid people who listen to this stuff will just never know how amazing music can be.If this is the sound of my generation, well then yes... I hate my generation."
4,Limp Bizkit,"This CD is awesome. I personally think that Getcha Groove On is the best song, but Urban Assault Rollin' is pretty good too. You should get this CD if you like Papa Roach, Linkin Park, etc, and if your parents are cool with cussing."
3,ROCKIN' BUT.....,"As grunge died rap became pop.Then rock joined rap.Im not complaining,man but that doesn't go.Still I can't disagree with MY WAY.That song is far out and is one of the closest thing to metal in this album.You must admit the band is talented in a way especially the guitarists but Fred Durst must chill and make real hard rock and metal.What side are you on man?It's making metal more rap and pop.Now I a loooooooooooooove metal and hard rock but this isnt it.Also cursing doesnt make a CD good man.The music does and the lyrics should be about partying or something.But it does destroy the f&*&*&*&*&****&*&*&&&%$ pop craze.So Limp chill and make REAL rock n roll.Fred will be remembered for ALMOST wrecking rock n roll by using it with rap but get this and chill awhile.But for real rock and metal get AC/DC's STIFF UPPER LIP and party with booze weed chicks and rock n roll.P.S TO KURT COBAIN. NOW THAT YOURE GONE MAN ALMOST HORRIBLE MUSIC IS HERE.OH WELL ROCK IN PEACE."
2,Bizkit,"I have been a limp fan since 1998 and after going to see them at WOODSTOCK 99 everyone that went thought they were one of the best bands of their time, and after listening to this new CD it puts Bizkit to shame, but after seeing them live where they played songs from CSATHFW and they sounded quite good and i think even though people put them down cause they brought out a bad album you realy have to see them in concert."
3,Bizkits New Album,"The new album does have some good tunes with catchy scratch beats in places but i think it is just a remake of Significant Other, Durst and co. have just gone down hill from Three Dollar Bills, when they where heavy, Selling out was the worst thing that Bizkit could have done, yes more people buy their cds but they have lost the respect of the long term fans of alternative music, at Limp concerts now little kids always get messed up in the mosh and they have to hospital and then Bizkit get the blame, also every kid now has one of those red caps, yes i use to wear one years ago but not anymore!. There are a few good songs on the album but i would recomend Three dollar bills or Significant Other, Don't get me wrong i have been a fan of Limp since 1998 when they were unknown and i am still a fan i just hope the new forth album will be back to what they used to be like."
3,So-So,"This CD is...ok. I like Significant Other better. ""Rollin"", ""My Generation"" is kind of ok. I don't really like any of the songs in this CD, but I'm a Limp Bizkit fan, so this CD is ok."
4,good work,just hearing 30 seconds of each song i thought it was very good work i will be buying this cd real soon would love to download it any suggestions please write to me thanks
1,Oh dear...,"What a complete load of rubbish... Limp Bizkit's third outing sees them trying even harder than the first two and failing even more. Modern radio should be ashamed at the way that it is encouraging bands like this. There was once a time when the ""superstar"" bands were there because they genuinely deserved it. Bands like the Smashing Pumpkins, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Nine Inch Nails and Alice in Chains got the spotlight because they genuinely deserved it... it's a travesty that manufactured tryhard bands like Limp Bizkit can achieve greater popularity than the little real talent that's still out there. Big ups to the major labels for flooding the market with rubbish like this, eh?"
4,different is better,"I believe that this c.d. is awesome and is one of my favorites. I like just about every song on the album and it's a good c.d. to put on and just let it play. I like rock and rap and it was mixed in this c.d. and I liked it alot. There were many different kinds of songs on the c.d.. I would just like to say that it is is a great c.d. and hope the next one is to in ""my generation""."
4,Very Good,"This CD is great, for the most part. If you listen to the whole 3 doller bill ya'lls, then this, you can see how they have grown. It is very much like S.O ( the last CD ) Some slow songs, heavy songs, rap songs, and a mix of all them. The song ""Rollin"" their first single, kinda gives an idea for the whole album, if you like both of limps other cd's, you will most likely like this one."
2,So much promise yet they remain predictable and disgusting,It is a sad story when you think about it. Their debut was a near prefect release. Significant Other gave us a new sound. Not really a bad thing but it made hardcore fans pretty upset. But with this album they have not reinvented themselves but they have become downright predictable. Every song is like significant other's track list just worse. My Generation is a good song but lets face it. Limp Bizkit has lost Originality and whatever happened to that LOW END. they really blew it this time.
1,What a joke!,This album is horrible and the 5 star reviews on here don't even know how to use proper grammar! Enough said! >:(
1,Limp Bizkit rule......no I'm just kidding,".......seriously,don't waste your money in these stupid things....you rather give it to welfare or something....we hope not to see these guys once again ever....and we hope that Less Is More never face the day light"
3,"Not the best, but still a must-have","A word of advice to those of you who are willing to put up with Fred Durst's *F-word* fetish...DO NOT get the edited version of this album! On some of the songs, so many words are cut out that the song actually becomes irritating to listen to, leaving you thinking that you would rather hear the foul language than deal with a song that's half-way gone because of editing. The album has some good songs, including both versions of ""Rollin'"" and the theme from Mission Impossible 2. ""Boiler"" is also a very awesome song, especially if you have some good subs to jam with (listen for the punches of low-low bass throughout the song). If you're into some harsh rock and you don't make the mistake of buying the edited version, you'll enjoy this album."
1,Vanilla Wafers and eau de toilette,"Oh, yay! Another manufactured POP BOY BAND with inane lyrics and sell-out attitudes. There is not enough talent in this band to fill up the top joint of Britney Spears' pinky. Their songs are juvenile and are about as socially conscious as The Baha Men's ""who let the dogs out."" If this is hard-core, the only thing to be pissed off about is this crappy music encoded on this disc. It's a good thing that Fred D. is friends with Carson Daily, they sooo have a career three years from now. MTV would NEVER crap their favorite turds. Maybe they can hang out together at a hot dog stand and relive their glory days; recalling when they were every thirteen year old's idol. If this is the future of ""rock and roll"" then I would rather listen to Color Me Bad. DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS CD, if you want real rock check out AC/DC's new album. Forget this band...limp is right."
1,What is this crap?,"God I'm so damn sick of hearing Fred Durst's annoying, whiney voice and the rest of Limp Bizkit for that matter. I think they wrote these songs in five minutes in hopes of getting fifteen buck out of a bunch of middle schoolers, who would listen to John Denver if it was played on TRL. This album is so stupid and every single song sounds the same. Mabye if these guys sat down and gave their songs some thought, insted of saying the f-word every two seconds, they could write something that has some meaning and sounds halfway intellegent. The only song that sounds different from the rest is ""Take a look around"". I loved Limp Bizkit on three dollar bill, but now I can't even stand hearing the words ""Limp Bizkit"". And just like the review above mine, what's up with Fred putting down Trent Reznor and the Nine Inch Nails. Trent will be making music long after Limp Bizkit has gone bankrupt and nobody remembers them. Sorry L.B. but you also lost another fan."
1,Waste Of Money,"Limp Bizkit was an artist I used to respect. 3 Dollar Bill Ya'll and Significant other were two quality CDs.In the last few years, the music industry has shifted drastically to hip-hop. Even rock artists (Limp Bizkit), began to be influenced by this movement. Unfortunately, it is one with no originality and we have all heard it before. This album offers nothing more than the dozens of others that have been pushed out to be bought by the masses of teen-agers. It is especially sad because this CD seems to use the F word as much as possible just to sell CDs.Unless, you enjoy listening to uninspired, already done music then I do not suggest this album at all. In fact, I would consider it a waste of money. Try listening to Radiohead, Metallica, etc. who actually try new things."
1,Terrible album overall,"This album plain out sucks,Significant other was bad enough,but now this we have this garbage?I liked Three Dollar Bill$ Yall,since it had a lot of energy.Chocolate Starfish and The Hot dog Flavored Water is a stupid album name.The only 2 decent songs on the album are Boiler (starts to die after a few minutes though) and My Way.If you really want a NU-Metal album,go grab a System of a Down Toxicity or just get a Korn album (First Album)."
3,Decent,"I have been listening to Limp Bizkit ever since Three Dollar Bill Y'All came out. I loved that CD, and later bought Significant Other. I liked it, but not as much as Three Dollar Bill. I recently bought Chocolate Starfish the first day it came out, having heard Rollin' and My Generation, and I have to say, although the CD is good, I was dissappointed. Some good songs include Livin' It Up (recording of the full version of the song Durst did with Christina Aguileria at the MTV Video Awards), Rollin', My Generation, Hotdog, and Take a Look Around (from MI:2). However, songs like the other version of Rollin' with DMX, Method Man, and Redman, and Getcha Groove On made it more sound like I was listening to just another Rap CD, which is dissappointing coming from Limp. To Limp Fans who liked both of their other CD's, I would say that it is worth the money, but it is dissappointing."
3,This isn't their best album but it will do.,"Here in England, Limp bizkit are new on the scene, but I got their previous two albums last year, and it seemed like forever before this one came out. I have to say that I was highly disappointed - it isn't a bad album, but it doesn't strike me as being really good either. There is more rap in this album, but it doesn't go down very well - lots of peps have said this. Saying that though, I love the track 'boiler' and 'my generation' - but already it is getting over played so I will have to put the album away, and listen to three dollar and sig. other until album number 4 comes out. Buy the album to support Limp and get them to the top though."
5,The Bands Best CD,"Now I know a lot of people think that music is horrible if it has the f-word in it, but that just is one little detail. Limp Bizkit IS the complete band, especially with members like Fred Durst, Wes Borland, DJ Lethal, and others. With the rhyming, harsh beats, and cool rhythms, this CD is perfect. The remix of Rollin with Urban Assault Vehicle brings DMX and Method Man into the Limp Bizkit picture to make an awesome track. In this CD, Limp Bizkit shows that they can keep on Rollin'."
3,"Great music, but ridiculous lyrics","The reason why a gave 3 stars is because the music is great, with better lyrics it could have been more. It seems to me that Fred got out of inspiration on this one, because their really are some ridiculous songs on this CD. He even sings how many time he says the famous f-word in the song he is singing. Other pretty dumb songs are My Generation and Rollin'. This last song is now shown on MTV, and yes, the video is even more ridiculous. Luckily for LB, their music is pretty enegetic and powerful, which kinda compensates for the lyrics."
3,It is their third best album to date,"Well I was waiting for this album for months and months. And as soon as I got it, boy was I disappointed. Yes I am a true LIMP fan, and because of that I know that they can do several million times better. Gone are the songs such as Break Stuff, 1999 and Nobody loves me-now we have some other stuff which I dont know whether to love or hate. The stand out track for me has to be Boiler - which no-one has mentioned, and Hotdog. I don't know how long it'll be till their next album - please let it be much better than this. But it will grow on you after a few weeks!"
3,Some songs are cool but but the 80 percent of the albumsucks,I only really lisen to about 4 songs on that CD. Only 4 songs are really good on there Go Download some songs on Napster (Why you still can) and see for your self I sugg that you buy there old album.
2,Trash,"Is there any other way to describe this album, other than using the word trash? I have never listened to a more copied, unthoughtout album in my life. I mean Limp Bizkit was good on 3 dollar bill and sig other kept them going. but this is (....) how can u put out an album using the same riffs and useless lyrics. the only reason i gave this album 2 stars instead of one was becuz i enjoy ""hold on"" which features Scott Weilend (i belive) the rest are repetitive and meaningless. limp would be cool without fred but nothing will ever happen to limp since fred is head of interscope. too bad for jon, sam, wes and dj lethal. quite talented guys too."
3,Hmmmmmm...,"""3 dollar bill yall"" was great, and ""Significant Other"" is probably my favorite CD EVER, but this one falls short. Fred has sold out a little to the MTV people. Not enogh effort was put into the album and it clearly shows in its poorer quality compared to Limp's other CDs. I'm hoping for a better effort from the band the next time around. Till then PEACE."
4,I'm not quite sure...,"Despite the immature and mostly meaningless lyrics in which Fred tries to fit in as many 'f*cks' as possible, while advertising his band and himself, I still like this CD. It has some good instrumentals, some cool guitar solos, and the tunes are pretty catchy. A few of my favorite songs are The One, on which he kinda holds himself back for a song and actually has more intellegent lyrics, It'll be Okay, which I heard in a radio interview he wrote after hearing that Kurt Cobain was dead, and he was feeling down and uninspired; it shifts pace a bit from lighter guitars to heavier sections with more percussion. Hot Dog I find funny and it sticks it your head, though it might not be a good idea to go around singing it in public, hehe :) Most of the other songs are alright, could've been better, could've been worse."
5,Great album,"I was a little nervous when i purchased the album thinking that limp may have gone too mainstream, but once i heard the whole album, it is a masterpiece. my favorite song is ""hold on"" which scott weiland and fred durst co-wrote. that song is a great track. it is probably one of their better mellow songs. on a rock and rap standpoint, of course, ""getcha goove on"" is my favorite. limp always seems to pull out the best guest rappers on their album. although, i would like them wo go back to their old ""3 dolla bill"" style, i think that they are still creating out of this world mixes and lyrics. peace."
4,Fred Durst and the Boys do it again!,"Who thought that they would put out an album that rivals all of their previous releases? I did. I was not disappointed. The hard hitting ""Getcha Groove On"" is probably their best song ever, not to mention the split personality song ""Rollin'"". All around great album to just sit back and chill to. Although you might be tempted to get out of your seat and jump around."
3,"Good Album, but way too raunchy to be great............","This was a pretty good album I thought. It had a lot of cool jams on it. However, it seems that Limp Bizkit tried to see if they could use the 'F' word as much as possible! I don't mind swearing in music, but the ""2 Hot Dog"" song said the 'F' word way too much! I call it the 'F' word song because Limp Bizkit says it atleast 60 times! But the CD is still cool though. I like Korn a little bit better. But songs like ""Rollin"" and ""Getcha Groove On"" are my favorite tracks on this CD. Not for all tastes, but good if you like this sort of thing."
5,Limp Bizkit Rocks!,"This album is the best the band has ever produced! I thought it would be hard for them to beat Significant Other but with all the talent in Limp Bizkit you can count on them to produce good music. They have their own style unlike all those boy bands out there who call themselves talented! My Generation, My Way, Rollin', Livin' It Up, Take A Look Around, and Hold On are some of my favorite tracks. The Outro is hilarious too."
2,The track Hold On was scratched!!!,"This record is a ""like new record"" and shouldnt be scratchet, im so desapointed becouse that track is the best in the album!"
3,So it comes to this . . .,"I used to like this album when I was a kid, but now it's nowhere near as great as I thought it was. This is probably Limp Bizkit's weakest album. The heavy-hitting sounds and significant lyrics found in ""Three Dollar Bill Y'all"" are completely gone, replaced by pop-rock melodies and annoying ramblings about money, women, and ""living life in the fast lane"". Much of the songs sound more like fillers than actual ones. But it's not a total loss. ""Full Nelson"" and ""Take a Look Around"" actually sound pretty good. ""Boiler"" and ""Hold On"" are the most mature songs on this CD. ""My Way"" . . . meh.Oh well, I'll still have ""Three Dollar Bill Y'all"" to listen to.Grade: C"
1,COMPLETE GARBAGE!,"If I could give this l/4 star, I would! This is the biggest ripoff CD of the year 2000. It is utter filth and garbage. This group is only interested in ripping off teenagers that bought this based on the group's name. To continually use the ""F"" word throughout the album, just promotes this band's ignorance. They lack originality, morals and disgrace the music industry. Don't waste your time buying this CD, you will just promote them to do another piece of garbage and be putting your hard earned money in their pocket. There is plenty more to choose..."
1,WTF????????????,"I cannot believe I used to like this pile of sh-t! it is the definition is WACK! Every song is terrible, the only 'ok' song is Getcha Groove On, only because of Xzibit. One of there most wack sonsg is 'Hot Dog' where Fred says f-ck 46 times (ooooh he's hard, not) alos 'Rollin' 'Take a look around' and all the other tracks which are just WACK. Take my advice and don't buy this or any other of there albums becuae they are jsut terrible.Fred Durst, wes borland and all the others FU%K YOU!!!!!!!!!"
1,Cesspool of crap!!,"Okay.....rap metal or hip hop metal is just stinking the whole scene up. What does it comprise of; 4-5 rappers who proclaim Black Sabbath, Metallica and similar bands to be their influences(but were actually influenced by Public Enemy, or (worse)Ice Cube, Snoop Dogg), a guitarist who cannot play a lead sequence, a good bassist in a wrong band, a drummer who can play a bit...but not too much, a talentless DJ, and of course, a vocalist who wants to sound like Phil Anselmo and woo the ladies at the same time. A true protoype....LIMP BIZKIT. Silly name, silly music...and lyrics are just an excuse to say the F word a zillion times. If 6 million records were sold in USA, it goes to show the number of idiots in the country who can be easily amused by such crap. This band has infact doing the same thing that hair bands like Poison did to heavy metal in the 80's; stinking the scene. Hope this band disappears into oblivion asap"
4,More good stuff from the boys from Jacksonville,"Chocolate starfish continues where significant other left off. Limp is growing and their sound is evolving. You still have a lot of their hard rap/metal songs like my generation though. All that good stuff still remains. More diverse stuff is being done as well. My way is a great song and is the same mold as re-arranged. Hold on is a great song as well and almost surprising coming from Limp. Limp keeps growing and Fred Durst keeps showing how he is growing musically and mentally. If you are a fan or even if you are not, pick up Chocolate Starfish and enjoy."
5,AWESOME!,"This cd is totally AWESOME, you have to buy this cd if you liked the 2 other cds. Buy this cd now."
4,I Limp wit' the Bizkit,"This album, even though it has explicit content, is one that is always fun to listen to. The song lyrics go with the rythm. The way that Fred Durst, and Wes Borlin play, like a team, they can make rythm like Mozart. The way that the bass in always on beat with Durst, it always makes me beat my foot to the rythm. This album, with its creative title, odd words, explicit content, can grab your attention within the first few songs. The depressing songs, about girl friends, or the fast rap-rock songs that are energy prevolking, this makes for a good album. The way that the band can make the tempo rise, and fall, at their own choosing, it makes you feel the emotions that the band once felt, as they made these songs. The way that the band can draw you into their world is amazing, and because of this, they have made this album great."
5,Livin' It UP,"One great cd from LIMP BIZKIT! Great TRAX, especially the Hip-Hop version of 'ROLLIN'-Very H-O-T!!!"
4,The Bizkit does it again!,"Limp Bizkit has done it again. This CD will keep you listening over and over again. If the lyrics don't keep you listening, the music itself will. My personal favorites are My Way and both versions of Rollin'. This is definitely a MUST BUY CD!"
5,This CD couldn't be better!,"This CD is the best Bizkit, or should I say best CD to ever be recorded! Limp Bizkit is totally the best band out there, no doubt, they beat Korn and Orgy by a long shot. Not that I don't like Korn or orgy, INfact I love em, But limp bizkit is speaking for todays generation, and they are just better than all other bands. period."
1,very useful cd,"holy ...! I love this album.seriously, this cd really works for me! every time I play frisbee it never fails to keep in the air. God bless u soggy bizkit for once you did something useful!!! ummm.. would i listen to it? NONONON NO. but limpbizkit, my fine frisbee thanks you."
2,What is this?,"I give cd 2/5 because 2/5 of it is worth listening to. Before I decided to buy this cd, my friend showed me the lyrics to hot dog. The funniest thing I have ever seen. Every other word is f---, which doesn't sound terrible with the song. But just seeing the lyrics was hilarious. I only like 3 songs on here. Can you guess which ones? My generation, my way and rollin. I must admit, I haven't even tried listening after livin it up. I wanted to puke. Limp Bizkit would do much better if they stayed with 'metal' (if you call what they sing metal). I still wouldn't listen to it, but i think other people would. Ps: I don't think I have heard a limp bizkit song where they did not mention how great they are. Ugh! It reminds me of Eminem! =("
3,Not as good as it could have been.,"When I first picked up this album I thought it was good, but the more I listened to it the more I realized that it wasn't all that inspired. While I thought Significant Other was a step forward, this was a step back. Granted there are still some catchy tunes and riffs(Wes Borland is still damn good) but nothing really stands out. The problem maybe the lyrics. Some of Fred's rants don't really seem to lead us anywhere we haven't gone on the first two albums. Another problem is it seems like he says f*ck just as kind of a filler(ex. ""Hot Dog"" where he says he just said f*ck for the 46th time). In an era of wannabes these guys need to be better than everyone else. Which means the next album they put out better be a hell of a lot better. If you liked the first two albums, by all means pick this up. Just don't expect anything all that different."
1,"BRING BACK THREE DOLLAR BILL Y""ALL","i am really 16 but couldnt figure out how to use this so take this seroiusly. i was a fan of KoRn ever since their debut album and got into Limp when they first came out. Their fist cd was awesome with cool tracks like Pollution and Counterfeit. Unfortunetly, it all went downhill. Sig. Other was ok but choc starfish is just plain boring. the only fans of this cd are limp bizkits new fan base because all the old fans are disapiotnted at the way limp sold out and produced this crappy cd. do ur self a favour and buy their first cd or skip limp all together. if u are a 13 year old boy then i understand ull want this cd so u can loook cool to ur buddies, but when u get older ur realise how pathetic this album is. Cheers"
1,"Oh, Remembered Something Else","You know how Scott Stapp and Limp Bizkit were pissed at each other? Well, Creed kicks Limp Bizkit's ass, so shut up Freddie and go back to eating pork rinds or whatever the hell you used to do."
1,This really bites...,"I was really hoping this would be a great release. But nope. It just really stinks. I also think that Wes was telling the truth when interviewed by MTV when he said he didn't like any of the songs on this. How could he like any of them. For the real music, take the time to track down stuff by Dave Kusworth."
2,nothing special.,"more of the same .... Im a fan of their last cd, signifigantother, but this one just didnt entertain me. the ... of the mission impossible theme and the cheap shots at trent reznor were bad enough, but the music was not anything special. save some cash, if you have to hear it, find some mp3s."
1,I'm pretty open minded and I have nothing against fans...,"But I just can't really listen to this album. A friend of mine left the CD at my apartment and i thought...""What the hell. I'll give it a spin for the hell of it."" And ya know what? I had to take the CD out by the time it got to track 6(Rollin[Air Raid Vehicle])! I'll make this short: If you want to take a look at something by Limp Bizkit, borrow an album first just in case you get disapointed. And if you do, start with their debut, Three Dollar Bill Ya'll, that album (to my suprise) I found half way decent. So yeah there's my outlook on ""Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water"" and to the fans, hope you enjoy it.P.S.- I'd like to give thanks to the guy who finally said something about that Brandon Welts ""Psycho"" guy! He was getting on my f***in' nerves! Thats it Cya"
5,Limp Bizkit is back and better than ever!,"I'm a huge LB fan and could not wait to get my hand on this album. This album is a new level for them (just as Fred Durst promised). All the tacks rock. If you are already a Bizkit fan you'll love this record. If you started hating Limp after Significant Other, you'll hate them more. However, if you dug Significan Other, this is the record for you, plus you might win one of the gold CDs and get backstage passes for life."
3,Not a....,"Well. Limp bizkit is going over the ledge. With each CD gettin more and more MainStream. Thats just to bad. With this CD they have gone over to R&B which was not one of there parts on the 3$ album. Thats a shame, Cause the 3$ album in my oppinion was the best ever (so far). THis Album lacks all that the 3$ album had. but has gained some new stuff. It has no Heavy tune like Break stuff was on the Significant other album, and thats not good. IOf you like melodic R&b his is an album for you. If you liked the 3$ album like me i suggest that you buy something else."
2,Most Hated Album,"Fred Durst. Punk rock or rap. He should have just stayed with Punk Rock. Why did he make the move toward, trying to sound ghetto. Heres the main topics on this CD, how he dates fine bunny tricks, how hes rebellient and kids listens to him, and how he likes to use the F word. He cannot rhyme worth of lick other than the song where he used 64 ""F"" words and rhymed with simple stuff like mom dad, cop, badge. I was eager to listen to this album after I heard the song Rollin, Rollin remix, and My way. Broiler was on TV and that song is just 5 or 6 lines being repeated. Its like Limp Bizkit try 2 make the best of this album putting songs like Broiler on TV.Lyrics: F*Production: BDelivery: F*Overall: F** F means Failing in case some fans may misunderstand me as one the hardcore moshpit fans who uses the F words."
2,The Bizkit is Limp,"Oh dear. I liked Rollin' when I first heard it (when it was used for the Undertaker's {WWE Wrestler} tune), and so I tried to find the single. I couldn't find it so I bought the album. There were some good songs, but after a couple of months, it becomes repetitive like disco music (God, I HATE disco!).... At least no more albums after New Old Songs will come out."
2,What!? They're still around?,"This CD is a disgrace. It seems like Limp Bizkit is getting worse each CD. Anyways, why does he have to swear every 5 seconds? I just can't wait till their next one comes out!!! Fred Durst has at least some good in him. He produced groups like Puddle of Mudd and Staind. They're both way better than he is!! I gave this 2 stars because I like My Generation a bit. To all the people out there, please don't waste your money on this!! In 20 years no one will have heard of him unless he's in jail for something."
1,"Okay, lets try something new",Rate tis review not-helpful if you think this album worths more than 10 dollars.Rate this review helpful if you think this album doesn't even worth a penny.
1,Music for the un-discriminating fan........,"Fred Durst has sunk to a new low. Unless you're a 13 year old who thinks breaking your curfew is cool and hate your parents for not buying you a Playstation 2, then you most likely won't want to buy this cd. Millionaire playboy Fred whines about his life like a four year old who just broke his little red fire truck, while the drums are only satisfactory at best and the guitar riffs are ready made for the MTV set. Recommended only if you are a thug wanna be."
1,Save your cash folks,"This album is atrocious. It has no right to be called music, let alone rock. Limp Bizkit is worse than any of those no-talent 80's hair bands. The so-called ""music"" has absolutely no emotion whatsoever. Lyrically, a ten-year old could do better. All that egotistical Fred Durst can say is ""f this,f that."" Ridiculous. The musicians are only slightly better, fairly mediocre, if you ask me. And poking fun of Reznor? Trent is a thousand times better than Fred could ever imagine. He is not a moronic poseur like these sorry individuals. Save your cash for Nirvana or Smashing Pumpkins. Or try a little known band called the Get-Up Kids. Actually, 90% of the music today is better than Limp Bizkit, and that says alot."
1,Kick Fred out and you'll have a band.,"Back in 2000 I made my brother buy me this album and ever since I have regretted making him get it for me.Limp bizkit is a good instrumental band but their weak link is FRED DURST.If they took him out and replaced him some guy who won a reality show kind of like the INXS show they could get a more talented singer,better song writer and overall a more respectable person and human being.The only thing I got out of this album was the crystal casing for another album.If any band or even one man you can find for hurting nu metal is here,The songs are dumb and sound like a retarded person wrote but i believe amentally challenged person could have written a better song song than him, in fact I have met people with dissabilities that could write a song that could chastize them in public.I hope that after this some stations he in California could stop playing their songs and play way better nu metal fans than these has beens."
1,I've no more repsect for Durst. I think he's lost it.,"I used to have some respect for Fred, back in the Three Dollar Days - where the guitars actually had a prominent piece of the action. Those were the good ol' days.... back then....All I can ask now is, what HAPPENED to him? Does Durst honestly think we want to hear him scream the F word 50 times in one track?? What's he trying to be, another Insane Clown Posse? Then he has the nerve to insult other bands that ""don't match his style"". His punch on Nine Inch Nails was really uncalled for. They're metal, he's ....Heck, even the album's title [stinks]. It has no meaning, no reason, and it's too long.The pathetic thing is that the rest of the band has huge potential! Wes Borland scored among the top ten best guitarists in the COUNTRY. And yet, he is stuck in a band run by someone who practically pirated his way into Interscope.All in all, Durst is ... now. CSATHFW is a pure waste of talent on the band's part, and shows the lack of talent from Fred."
1,blech,"The one thing I really, REALLY can't stand is when some musicians start singing about how great they are. God, that is such a turnoff! And it's espically annoying when it's a cd like this one, where the only true meaning they're trying to get across is ""We're badasses"". Can't you just taste the formula behind every single track? Yuck...it makes me sick."
2,The Downward Spiral,"Three Dollar Bill was awesome heavy rap/rock! Significant Other was really good too, but its sound was starting to lean towards the next album... Chocolate Starfish!Let's see, where to begin.""Hot Dog"" is good and sorta funny, but did they have to rat on NIN? ""Full Nelson"" is ok, but the lyrics are overall very simple. ""Livin' it Up"" is also ok, but only for the first third of it. ""Take a Look Around"" is good. ""Getcha Groove On"" and the Urban Assault version of ""Rollin'"" are perhaps my favorites, only because the guest rappers' lyrics make a fool out of Fred. In fact, this album might have inspired me to look at Xzibit.The rest of the songs are childish, repetitive, stuck-up, and annoying. This is a terrible way for such an awesome band to end. I keep thinking how much better these songs would be if more time and thought had been taken on them. Even I could write better lyrics. Let's hope LB doesn't get stuck in this muddy rut."
1,THIS BAND SUCKSSSSSSSS,I purchased this CD from all the publicity I have been hearing about this band. I put the CD in the player once and it won't be there again. I like grunge music but this sucks. I am a guitar player and as a guitar player I know that it probably only took 2 hours to make this in the studio. It sounds so bad that I think they made the words up as they went along. And for the guitar in the backround...My 2 year old could of done better. There is to much talant out there for this CD to fly.
1,what is this waste?,"i dont think this cd is worth anything. How could you spend years making this, build up all this hype, and turn up with this? Is this even music?"
1,get a new singer,Fred durst's voice ruins everything. the sad thing is people actually buy limp stuff to hear him.
1,Limp Bizkit never had any touch to begin with...,"If it's metal you're looking for, check out Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Panteral, Iced Earth, Inflames, or Nevermore.But I'll review the album anyways.Guitar - Subpar, easy ..., no complexity; musically lacking here.Drums - Dry, uncomplex, no originality.Bass - All it does is use the root note and follow the guitar.Vocals - Fred sounds like he has something stuck ...Lyrics - [juvenille].'Nuff said. If it's a metal album you want, go buy Metallica's Master of Puppets."
1,Please put them out of their misery!,"The first time I heard the tracks on this CD I couldn't stop laughing. How is it possible for any band to be this bad?!? These guys are like Vanilla Ice part II, no talent just hype. I pitty the people who think this is worth their time. Kids, I know you're smarter than that. PLEASE, for your own sake, listen to better music. The only reason I give this even 1 star is well A, because Amazon won't let you give no stars, and B, the homosexual referance in the title is worth a laugh. ""The next morning Fred Durst's chocolate starfish hurt a little and there was hotdog flavored water all over his new silk sheets, but he had to admit that Carson Daly was the best he'd ever had."" How cute."
1,THIS CD IS GREAT!!!,"Great for a skeet shoot that is. MAYBE it deserves 1 star for the Weiland appearance, because that's about the only song I've listened to more than once. True Bizkit is over, we saw it coming with Significant Other, this reinforced it. The Rap Remix of Rollin' will make your eyes roll (to any old Skool Bizkit fans). And rippin' on Trent and NIN went over the line. My official position? DEATH TO ADDIDAS ROCK!!!!"
2,SOME ADVICE FOR FRED DURST:,"Stop singing.Your music is horrible and your fans are incrediblyshallow for buying into it!! Anyhow,I have some far more important advice for Durst and Co.Kenna is a new young artist that's from Ethopia via Virginia whose signed to Durst's Flawless Records.He's an edgy,experimental guy whose debut ""New Sacred Cow"" is currently being sat on by Durst and the brass at his label.His album is a mix of new wave,pop,heavy metal,alt-rock,and singer songwriter influences.It's really incredibly tight.Please look out for Kenna and try to check out his leadoff single ""Hell Bent"".So therefore,my advice for Durst is to shut his stinking mouth,turn to being a label exec,and take all that money he promotes the future-high school janitors Puddle of Mudd and spend it onKenna instead.Remember look for KENNA.Album called ""New Sacred Cow""."
1,"overhyped, overrated...","If you want to hear Limp Bizkit at their best, buy either of the first two albums. If you have [$] that you don't want and an aversion to good music, by all means pick up a copy of this album.Don't get me wrong, I used to be the biggest Bizkit fan in the world, thier live shows were the best I've ever seen and 'Three Dollar Bill' was (is) fantastic. But when a track like 'Get Your Groove On' makes it onto a record, [I start to lose interest]"
3,Intro is stupid,"Why people hate this band so much? Especially some real metal fans. I mean Limp Bizkit is not a great band like Bodom or Iron Maiden or early Metallica(of course). Their lyrics is stupid, Fred Durst is anoying, lots of songs are over play... but they're not that BAD.I hate rap and I like metal, but this band is just for fun."
1,No,"You know, all of these songs really are stupid. Like ""Hot Dog"" and ""Boiler"" obviously just put on this CD to attract attention to 50 f words and suicide. I mean really..its sad, because Limp Bizkit wasnt always this bad. Theyw ere never great, but this is the CD thats going to wreck their career. Sorry guys, you suck."
1,Musical toiletpaper,I'm upset that only one star is the lowest possible rating. This CD is garbage. Pure crap. You would still be getting ripped off if you purchased it from a pawn shop.
1,Awful.,"Here, we have the end of rock n roll. We have impostors as heroes. We have absolute garbage being shoved down our throats, while the suits behind these idiots ruin the entire music industry. Limp Bizkit are the death of rock n roll...... talentless wannabee's."
2,A Pathetic Follow-up to Significant Other,"Only the most devoted Limp Bizkit fan or anyone who thinks Fred Durst is hot will truly love this album. But for anyone else who has been waiting for this release to get their dose of rap-rock, this CD isn't so appealing. Limp Bizkit has seemed to use the same material and music making skills used on Significate Other to create the wishing to be comercial success of Chocolate Starfish and the Hotdog Flavored Water. Fred Durst goes on swearing for no real reason, DJ Leathel scratches in songs that sound actually good without it, and Wes Borland, Sam Rivers and John Otto play the same rifs and hit to the same beat as their sophomore release. The entire CD sounds the same as the last, so close you can even match songs together from both CDs. If you like Limp Bizkit and don't care about the unoriganality of their music, go ahead and buy this disc. But for those of us who like listing to GOOD music, mabey something else is waiting out there."
1,funny,"it's so funny to see the reviews of these mtv airheads saying stuff like ""if you dont like the album you probably just dont understand it."" yeah, thats right. i guess the lyrics are just way over my head like for example how fred durst uses brilliant irony in the song ""full nelson"" in saying that people shouldn't talk trash about him behind his back but instead say it to his face so he can kick their a$$. pretty funny considering that ""hot dog"" is nothing more than making fun of trent reznor behind HIS back. it's also really intelligent in the song ""take a look around"" when fred says ""i know why you want to hate me, because hate is all the world has even seen lately"" which brilliantly juxtaposes the rest of this hate-filled cd.truly brilliant!"
4,Put down your haterade...,"Most people who dislike Fred Durst,tend to take it out on the music,actually that is plain stupidity.These are ratings for MUSIC,not ratings cuz you think Fred is a punk etc.I never used to care for limp bizkit,but a lot of the songs are actually deeper than ""nookie"".Personally I think there is some pretty good song writing on this cd.Look beyond the surface,open your mind(if that's possible).I am not one of the mass media 'sheep',or flavor of the month fan.It used to be cool to like Limp,now it's in 'style' to hate 'em,these same haters were the ones moshing in the pit to Limp 2 years ago.Go figure.Bottom line:think for yourself,give it a listen."
4,"Good, but Significant Other was heavier","If you want something that is head banging and hardcore, go buy Significant Other. I do like Chocolate Starfish, and there are some pretty intense songs, but there are also very mellow songs, such as ""Hold On"". I do like both Rollins, Hot Dog, Full Nelson, and My generation, and some of the slower songs. I think Limp Bizkit has really expanded on the range of styles that this album covers, going from the ballad of ""Hold On"" to the Hip-Hop version of Rollin' (Urban Assault Vechicle). I was also more impressed with the lyrics in the previous album, allthough some of the lyrics on Starfish have meaning, a lot are just catch phrases and cliche sayings. I do not have ""Three Doller Bill Y'all"", so I can't tell you how it compares to that cd."
2,Not the best they've done - hints of selling out on here!,"This is definately NOT one of their best works. The weakest of the 3 albums, I would only recommend getting this for all the hardcore Limp fans out there. True disappointment :<"
4,Limp Bizkit with a Vengance,"Limp Bizkit strikes back with an alright CD. At first from the other reviews at AMAZON.COM I was presuaded not to buy this record.But I thought Id borrow it from a friend to see if it was really that bad. I wasnt amused when I heard hot dog at first,but after listening to it for a while, I started to like it.Rollin was not the ONLY good song. My Generation, Rollin (Urban Assualt and Air Raid Vehicle), My Way, Livin it Up, and more.It all adds up to a good CD.Also, I think the song Boiler is underrated by a lot of people. I think they should of made a video out of that.Anyway...Do not listen to all reviews about this album.Borrow it from a friend or something and see what you think. I will admit that the lyrics could have been better, but that doesnt make this a bad CD.Worth the $$$.Dont take my word for it, go buy it."
4,It Rock's but it's defenitly not the best,"I think it is a good album, but is not limp bizkit BEST album, if U want to buy bizkit's BEST album buy three dollar bill y'all or significant others..."
3,"More of the Same, indeed, but listenable and enjoyable.","Limp Bizkit, with their third, oddly-named title ""Chocolate Starfish and the Hotdog Flavored Water"" once again proves to the world they know exactly what to do to make people buy records. Sure, their music isn't (and hasn't since the first CD) very good, but their catchy rhythms in songs like ""rollin'"" and ""Take a Look Around"" will make any rock fan start headbanging at the first listen. Sure, Limp Bizkit's lyrics sound dumb and dont make sense (On one song, lead singer Durst says the F word 50 times) but the innovative DJ beats of DJ Lethal and catchy chords of head guitarist wes borland make this CD worthwhile. Oh, and Fred: think of a better name for your next CD."
1,Disappointing follow-up,"I must admit, I did not purchase the previous offering by LB but enjoyed it thoroughly. Figuring this CD couldn't be much worse, I dished out 15 bills and was shocked at the lack of feeling that went into this CD. Only one catchy song (Rollin') and the rest was just rants and profanity. Not what I was looking for in the first place."
1,Why you hatin',"Why y'all hatin? Just take it eaze an' listen 2 diz album. Freddy-D is a genius, he drops dem wicked rhymes just like Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer before him. Whats more, he keeps one foot firmly planted in Backstreet Boy territory with his emotional falsetto. And whats all this talk about the f-bomb? The Bizkit Crew is just trying to keep it real. I don't know what you are all talking about, Limp Bizkit is the shiznack and have loads of street cred. If you want some mad rhymes and some good cruising tuneskis, then pick this album up. If you want to be enlightened and empowered then buy it. Limp Bizkit is still relevant in today's modern social landscape. People like Fred Durst, Vanilla ICE, MC Hammer and the Backstreet Boys will always be number one and will never die like other poser bands."
1,Horrible,"After their first CD came out, i figurd Limp Bizkit would be a force to reckon with in years to come. Their second CD wasn't bad either but i figured they would come back harder than ever. Wow, was I wrong. This is quite possibly one of the worst CD's i've ever considered buying. Theyve almost totally abandoned their rock roots and gone completely rap. It's not even as if they are good at rapping. Rollin' is basically the hokey-pokey in a rap version and my generation is an excuse to say the word F*** as many times as possible. Terrible lyrics, bad music, and the loss of what got them here in the first place make this album one of the worst post-debut album I've ever heard."
1,Limp Bizkit is utter [...],"This album is nothing but the same old rehashed junk from signifucant other. This is NOT metal in any shape or form. Bizkit only appeals to 12=15 yr old boys or girls who don't really know what rock music is. If you want some good metal/rock go for Spineshank, Tool, Godsmack, Simon Says, Disturbed, or anything but Bizkit. Bizkit is junk, feel like wasting your money on an awful band then Bizkit has the albums for you...OOOO and they have a remix one too..."
5,Limp Does It Again,"Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water, weird title but it doesn't matter because the cd is bump'n. The best songs are ""hot dog"", livin' it up"",""getcha groove on"", and ""my generation"". And also, ""rollin'(urban assult vehicle) w/ Dmx,Method Man and Redman, is tight! Significant Other might be a little better but that was like a ten star cd! If you are a limp fan, definitely just go pick it up."
4,Who woulda thunk it?,"I hate Fred Durst, I hate Limp Bizkit. I hate the title of the new Limp Bizkit album.But the album is undeniably great.""Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water"" is easily the most fun album of the year, a loud, obnoxious ode to excess that will be pumping on stereos across America for a ridiculously long time. Nearly every track has something cool to offer, from the hysterically vulgar lyrics of ""Hot Dog""... to Scott Weiland's haunting ""Hold On,"" to the pure fun of ""Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle)"" to the old school rap flavor of ""Getcha Groove On"" (featuring Xzibit). This is a record that demands to be listened to at top volume.Does it mean much? No. Is it socially relevant? No. Is it fun? Without a doubt. Give in, defy your instincts, buy the album. You will not be disappointed."
2,lord help these guys to write some better music.,"o my god. this is a re-release of significant other. they have 2 full-fledged rap songs. and hot dog has no meaning to it at all. thank god for some of their hits like my way and take a look around, otherwise this is a 1-star album. their songs are meaningless and 90% of the songs sound just like the track be 4. i suggest you keep your 15.00 and save it for linkin park or conspiracy of one by the offspring. these guys are taking popular demand and begin every song like so: ""bring it on"" or ""get the **** up"" and they are so unoriginal and non-artistic, it just sickens me."
2,Save your money,"I like Limp Bizkit quite a bit however, I feel this was a very poor cd and didn't meet any of my expectations. It appears as if Limp Bizkit is trying to aquire a new style, that just didn't work. It's half rap half is some semblence of the alternative style they have devolped previous to this cd. It is possibly the most conceited album ever created, with the use of their name in almost every song. Further, the lyrics have something to be desired, specifically in songs like Rollin' (both versions) and My Generation, in fact they come off as goofy. I ask you to save your money on this cd, and not make the mistake I have."
5,put you're hands up.... but don't put them down!,"THIS CD IS DA BOMB, PLAIN AND SIMPLE. THANK GOD FRED GOT AWAY FROM ALL THAT CRAP IN HIS OTHER ALBUMS. IF YOU LOVED LIMP BEFORE, THEY'RE NOT DISSIN' YOU THIS TIME. SO BUY THIS ALBUM!WARNING- do not by the limited edition one. it only comes with an extra cd with only one song on it, boring as it could get. it's not worth you're money, but this is!"
2,"SONGS TOO LONG, SOUNDS JUST LIKE THE LAST ONE","This CD was ok, but many of the songs sounded exactly like songs from Sig.Other. The songs also dragged on a bit, I found myself skipping to the next track because they were just too long. Rollin' is great, so is 3 and 10... 13 is great and almost haunting, but is also too long of a song. You can sing ""rearranged (sig.other)"" behind ""the one(starfish)"" and they sound exactly the same. Sounds just like the last one."
1,Nothing new at all. It sucks,"What happened to Limp Bizkit since the good ol' days of three dollar bill. Their follow up albums have been very weak. This new album is no different than Significant Other. It has the same sound as Significant Other, and even the booklet inside looks the same. Basically it's Significant Other but with a different name and cover. Also Fred Durst's voice on this album is extremely annoying. All he does is squeek his voice, and he does on almost every song. These guys are too caught up in the whole junior high, mainstream TRL crowd, and it's made them forget their early, true fans. If they can create something that has the same tone and sound as three dollar bills then I would like these guys again, but until then I'm staying away from this band. Save your money on this one."
1,Just Bad Music,"I own the CD, in my opinion this is just bad music writing. Save some money. do something you may enjoy better. (like getting a tooth pulled)"
1,Zero Stars,"Ok I'll keep this short...The band (not Durst) has talent. Wes Borland is an innovative guitar player, Sam Rivers a good bassist, John Otto a great drummer and DJ Lethal is untouchable since House of Pain... but Fred...my God, you're awful!!The so called ""lyrics"" on this album are nothing more than immature swearing, ""Hot Dog"" or nothing more than boasting about how tough and ""ghetto"" Fred is(Rolling)...The average intelligence level of everyone has decresed after this album was released and if another one comes out (come on guys, follow Wes's lead) then it will truly be the nail in the coffin for humanity. Do not pick this up. It is neither ""phat"" nor ""crunk""(whatever that's supposed to mean). Just plain awful."
1,Matty P speaks,"Well what can you say about an album of this stature? Well the awnser is not much. From the outset this thing creates a barely audioble drone which can't really be classed as music, it's musicians have less talent then the Venga Boys, it's title is highly unaumsing and I'd be ashamed to say I had anything to do with it. All in all a complete waste of your and my time."
2,Their name says it all.,"We're Limp Bizkit! We swear a lot! Our former guitarist wore weird makeup! We hate any band with more talent than us!Aren't they cool? Every CD Limp Bizkit makes seems to get worse. Fred's lyrics are pretty laughable. He spends an entire song trying to fit in as many obsenities as possible..., meanwhile insulting Trent Reznor, who has more talent than 100 clones of this band.While some of the guitar work is catchy, this album seems aimed towards 'angry' preteen crowds spoonfed on mediocre MTV fare. As a whole, Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water is about as refreshing as a flat, warm coke in the middle of a desert."
1,please...,"(...) if this isn't the band's worst album, i don't know how you get much worse. to say that bizkit is still cutting-edge and that anything durst has to say is meaningful outside of his own angsty juvenile poser-world is laughable. i'm sick of hearing durst whine about how critics hate his music when rolling stone is shoving positive reviews down readers' throats. if you want ""nu-metal"" that isn't tainted by it's front man's delusions of grandeur, try Linkin Park, Lifer, or early Incubus. without wes, it'll be interesting to see if bizkit's next album is even listenable."
1,Another horrible nu-metal album!!,"""Ya dude, Limp Bizkit like totally rocks....I hang out with my homies at the mall all day then we be down with the hard music at the Bizkit show."" I think maybe these children into bands like this have never heard good metal bands that actually do rock, so they don't realize how dumbed down a band like Limp Bizkit really is, and how Fred Durst is trying to fashion everyone in his dumbed down image. Musically, what is there to really talk about, just some simple open strumming or basic 2 chord songs any beginner guitarist can play. The opening tracks are pretty dumb too, especially since Nine Inch Nails are one of my favorite bands!!! In fact, go get some NIN and avoid LimpBizkit all together!!!!"
1,Limp what?,I'm gonna make this short and sweet...Limp bizkit's new album is nothing special. It's just the same ol'sounds. Their music(new album)is boring and it makes no sense. They have lost what being a band is all about. Now it's all about the money and less about the orginiality. Buying this cd is a huge waste of money. I'm so glad I didn't spend my money on something soo worthless and just plain ol'stupid.
2,LIMP BIZKIT ROCKS,"Who thought that they would put out an album that rivals all of their previous releases? I did. My boyfriend and I were not disappointed. The hard hitting ""Getcha Groove On"" is probably their best song ever, not to mention the split personality song ""Rollin'"". All around great album to just sit back and chill to. Although you might be tempted to get out of your seat and jump around"
1,Limp Album from Limper Bizkit,"I had high expectations for this album. But, as oft is the case the band failed to live up to expectations. When they failed to find lyrics they often fell back on catch phrases from their last album. The music just isn't there. Granted it is loud, but as I said above they seemed to just rely on their past performance, rather than produce powerful tunes. Not catchy. Limp."
4,Not Bad...Not Bad At All...,"Well Limp Fans, let's face it...it's another step up for The Bizkit, and well....it couldnt have been in a better direction. Musically, the album is full of new sounds and phat beats. Lyrically, Fred is still MC'ing well and good....for a balding White Guy from Jax. I've never been impressed with the higher pitched, whiny voice of the Durst, except for maybe on Three Dollar Bill, Yall$, where he did less ""singing"" and more screaming. Overall...an excellent album with a few minor downsides. Buy it...listen to it..love it. But in Fred's own Words, ""It's no Stairway To Heaven"".~Chuck"
5,Limp Bizkit Rocks,This is by far the best Bizkit CD! It is so meaningful! It is intense and you can rock to it at the same time! You would be a fool not to pick this one up!
4,A great album but more of the same?,"Which shouldn't be considered a bad thing, as long as you enjoyed Significant other. With the release of significant other, limp bizkit decided to evolve and go for a more well rounded sound. They continue this tradition with chocolate starfish. Many of they songs even use bits and peices from previous songs. The cd starts out with their usual non-associated intro, providing more of the same robotic sounding voices. Then moving on to hot dog, which sets the tone for the rest of the cd. Rock mixed in with rap. Overall its a very good album with the exception of 1 or 2 songs but If you liked significant other you'll love this."
1,It's really not good.,This album was a huge seller before people actually heard it. This album doesn't nearly measure up to significant other. It's not good. It's just not good.
5,A 12-Year Old Kid Reviews This Album For Your Enjoyment.....,"D00D MAN THIZ ALBUM ROCKZ, IT IZ SO KOOL!!!! F' THIS AND F' THAT! LIMP BIZKIT STYLE, THEY ARE THE BESTEST BAND IN THE WORLD, TRL R00LZ D00D! ALL THE KIDZ AT MY SKOOL LISTEN TO THIZ AN IF U DONT U SUK D00D!!!! THIZ IZ METAL AT ITS BESTEST AND THE BEST METAL ALBUM EVER SINCE I KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT METAL EVEN THOUGH IM 12! DONT LISTEN TO ALL THOZE OTHER GUYZ WHO KNOW ABOUT REAAAAL MUSIK! LISTEN TO IT BECAUSE ITS K00L D00DER!!!!! CARSON DALY RULEZ!!!People who bought this CD also bought: A swift kick in the ass.(WHOA I CUSSED D00D! K00LNEZZ!)"
2,lame cd,Limp Bizkit are done.Fred is obviosly running out of things tosay. you can tell by the way he swears at least twice in eachsentence. The only good songs are the rap version of rollin and it'll be OK (which is inspired by kurt cobain). Most of the songs are the same format as significant other. There best cd is three dollar bill yall so you should get that if you really need a limp bizkit cd otherwise spend your mony on a good cd like Deftones white pony or Slipknot.
1,GOD HELP US ALL!!!!,"JESUS CHRIST THIS IS AN AWFULL CD!i give them credit for ""$3 bill yall"" it was ok but im still not a huge fan of that cd, i dont even own it. but this is a sad excuse for music, music is suposed to be a form of art but this is just a form of sh*t! even when everyone was listening to them in the '90s i hated them. i dont see how they even got popular! this is unlisten able, i would rather be violently tourtued by a nazi on meth during world war 2 then listening to this cd! its just that awfull. first boy-bands then this load of rat ass, god what is this country coming to....."
1,Worst cd,Limp bizkit is a joke. fred durst is an annyoing singer. this maby be the worst cd i have heard. there is not one good song on the whole cd. the bigggest wait of $15 i have ever spent. i listen to the cd once and give it to my brother. so save you money and buy a cd worth buying
1,Mainstream Rock at its Worst!,"1 Star is low enough to express how terrible this album truely is. Fred Durst might have a knack for finding unknown bands but apparently he doesn't put his own albums in the player too often. Personally, I can't say I blame him. Unoriginal and uninspiring songs fill this album. If you do end up buying this album, at least you can feel good about knowing you can use it as a frisbee or a coffee coaster. If you think Limp is the pinnacle of rap-rock, do yourself a favor and pick up any album by Rage Against the Machine. You can thank me later."
5,Limp Bizkit does it again!,"This is a great album!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A few of the best tracks are ""My Generation,"" ""Hot Dog,"" ""Take a look around"" (also found on the 'M-I:2' soundtrack), and... well... the whole album. If you like a mix between Rock, rap, alternative, and funk, this is the CD for you. A must have in anybody's collection,"
4,One of Limp's Best,"I do miss the nookie. But on Choclate Starfish Rollin, My Generation and The One keep the cd in the player long enough before you wanna thro the nookie in there. This album is very good, well written songs and great vocals. The band sounds greater than ever and Xzibit as a guest, did a great job. Congratulations to Fred and the boys on a great third album."
2,Nothing New Here.... In Fact Nothing Good Either...,"Wow.So I was eagerly waiting to get the new CD, after seeing Bizkit live and playing Significant Other so much that it wore out the cd. I was looking for more hard hitting, angry intelligent Durst.Too bad.Instead of Other's pointed message and catchy tracks, CS&THFW was full of pointless dribble (give me the microphone, let me throw down...) and the same bass line over and over. Nothing to mix up the album, nothing new to throw out, nothing worthwhile.It just seems like an attempt to suck all the $ possible out of their remaining 2 minutes of fame. Look elsewhere for your angry rock fix."
3,didnt meet expectations,"I've listened to most of the songs and so far they've seemed to be sub-par from what i expected. Rollin'in my opinion is the best song on the cd, and it isn't even THAT great. I like the song but it isn't nearly as good as other songs he has written. Song #2, Hot Dog is pretty good too because it is entertaining to listen to all the swearin and bad mouthin of other people that he does. Numbers 10 and 11 are also alright to listen to since they actually have some kind of melody and flow to them and it mixes it up from beats such as Rollin'. If i knew all of this information before I bought the cd I would have 2nd thoughts about buying it, but I still would. After listening to it more I'm sure I'll like them better overall. It would be hard to follow up on his last cd Significant Other which was spectacular...so buy the cd, it should be worth it."
4,It is pretty decent,"This cd is pretty good. The songs are high energy but it still didnt capture the sound on the first album. Limp has gone pop, but the songs on this cd are still decent. yah."
2,What happened Limp?,"This CD is horrible albeit a few points. ""Take a Look Around"" is probably Limp's last great stand. But I think these guys have seriously sold out to MTV. Anyone seen the video for ""Rollin""? Fred in a ballroom with girl dancers. Im sorry but this is to N'Sync or Britney Spears to be metal/rap. And yes, I did listen to the lyrics, but Im sorry. When Fred sais the ""F"" Word after every sentence, it gets pretty rediculous. 3-Dollar Bill was Limps best album and even Signifigant Other was good. But i think this CD really lacks power. Ill give props to Wes because he is in my opinion one of the best guitar players of any metal band today (aside from Kirk of Metallica). Unfortunately Limp will be praised by every TRL fan out there and this CD will succeed. Oh well....lets see where Korn goes."
3,Misunderstood Album,"Limp Bizkit is a very misunderstood band. I do not respect them as artists. They are entertainers everybody. Comparing Limp Bizkit and NIN or any other artist's music is like trying to compare apples and bananas, you can try stating the obvious, but other than that nobody can say which is better. Their music is fun and airheaded, and annoying at points. But they are entertainers, and they succeed at that. This album was filler, hopefully following something better in the future. I would reccomend this album if you are a die-hard fan, but if you're just getting into Limp Biz get 3 dollar bill or Significant Other."
2,2 and a half actually,"I could really care less if a band ""sold out"" because music should sell well if it is good. Now Significant Other was fairly good and a hell of a lot better than 3db, but CSF.. really has some just terrible things happening to it. 1. Fred Durst, you know you don't have to use the f word every 3 seconds to be considered cool. 2. The band has gotten lazy, they know damn well that their album will sell well and it seems that this whole album sounds like a demo tape. 3. The ego has grown...and grown...and grown...and grown...4. Hotdog, sorry but NIN is one of my favorite bands and I don't really consider it funny at all.All in all it could've used some more time and some better songwriting."
3,nothing like Significat Other,"This album was a dissapointment after its predecessor. Basically, My Generation ,Take a Look Around and Livin It Up are as good as it gets and most of the other stuff lacks the class of their previous stuff. Rollin is so irritating now and I still can't believe it got to number one. If u buy one LB album get Significant Other."
3,"Music you can jam to, but talent is lacking","This Chocolate Starfish album has a lot of songs you can jam to. A few songs you can pump in your car, singing along to, while having your senses heightened. But once the nostalgia wears off, you're left with some downright foolish lyrics, weak vocals, and music that sounds pretty much the same as Limp Bizkit has ever done.Fred Durst has a very distinct voice. It doesn't matter that his singing voice is terrible, it's what makes the music stand out from the rest. A note to fans: if you like a particular song and aren't sure of the lyrics--keep it that way. You'd be better off not knowing the lyrics because they are on a junior high school level.All in all it's a decent album, but has some awful songs mixed in, which I expected in the first place."
2,"GOOD CREATIVE MUSIC, STUPID IMMATURE LYRICS...","what a disappointment... this so-called ""long-awaited"" joint from limp was supposed catapult them further but unfortunately it didn't (at least with me!!). if anything, it just goes to sound off that fred durst is an egomaniac. just because he's the frontman doesn't mean he should be all over the album. he doesn't even give his band members a chance to showcase their talents. without them, fred durst is nothing. his vox suck and his so-called lyrics suck even more. it's the music of wes, lethal, john, and sam that holds limp together as a group. fred durst's so-called lyrical talents and capabilities don't even count. he's just the poster boy for the group as he's always by himself on magazine covers and interviews.it's obvious that this album was rushed production-wise. although i like the hip-hop feel to it, i think limp should stay true to their metal roots and not sell out to the mainstream pop culture..."
1,Joke???,"If hobos were culled in a desultory fashion, told to singer a capella after smoking 100 cigars, their vocal talents would far supercede those of durst. He is bar none the least talented singer in any year, of any decade, of any century."
1,oh my god...,"I am sick of this band, and honestly, I'm sick of the faggots who hate it too and are suggesting bands like Slipknot, Lamb Of God, and other almost-as-gay-as-limp-bizkit bands. Limp Bizkit is probably among the worst bands I've ever heard, along with Slipknot which has more band members than instruments in a music store, and less talent than in a newborn monkey with cerebral palsy. If you decide to be less retarded, then go get music by the following bands:Children of BodomIn FlamesBlind GuardianMetallica (old)Iron MaidenJudas PriestIced Earth3 Inches of Bloodamong others. And whoever that idiot was who bashed on LB and then starts talking about f*cking Korn, Ill Nino, Coal Chamber, Shadows Fall, Slipknot and Skinlab? holy christ man, save yourself before its too late! all of you! ARMORED FIST!!"
1,Buy The Velvet Underground Instead,This is rock music for people who don't like rock music. How dumb do you have to be to like this (...)? Listen to the first Velvet Underground... listen hard. That's right it's called rock and roll. Limp Bizkit is just limp.
5,Vladimir is a dolt,"i read your reviews and frankly i'm sickened by them. i want to see anyone of you guys/gals get out there and just try to do what bizkit does. i'm not a big fan....in fact, this is the only lb cd that i have but all in all it a good cd. the songs rock and would make anyone want to bounce. vladimir wants us to believe that this cd stinks....well buddy, learn to spell (nothing could stink any worse than your sense of grammer). maybe durst isn't trying to make a point. maybe he just wants to have fun just like the rest of the world. crawl out from underneath your cappuccino and just loosen up, get laid or something. if you want a disk that you want to have fun to, get this one. if you want a disk to tell you what's going wrong in the world, then get a life. they're too short. i have one. do you?"
3,Combine the first two albums and you get this one,"I can't lie, I was one of the many people who totally accused Limp Bizkit of selling out after ""Significant Other"", and I just hated them after that. And, truthfully, they did sell out, as Wes sort of admitted in an interview. But they've gone back to having more of that raw vibe they had on the first album on some of the tracks, and it is much heavier and more rock-oriented than ""Significant Other"". Fred Durst isn't the best lyricist, but he wasn't that great on the first album either, so I don't want to dis him too much, even though he didn't write stuff as stupid as ""Rollin"" on the first album. Dont get me wrong, it's an ok track, but the lyrics just suck. So if you're one of the many who accused them of selling out, you may find some good stuff on here, but I don't think we can ever expect them to go back to the sound they had on ""Three Dollar Bill Y'all""."
3,Whoah different slightly....,"The new Limp Bizkit cd brought a few dissapoinments to me but there some excellent tracks on the cd. Hotdog is a profanity laced moshfest with distorted guitars and a fairly heavy sound next it is followed by another stand out track, My Generation. Well I thought if there was a reason to buy this cd then this is it, great work by DJ Lethal in this track. The only thing I didnt really like was the copius amounts of bad rap in this cd, I think on Rollin (Urban Assualt Vehicle) thats DMX I dont know but damn that sounds good. But other cameos arent the best, and Fred always has to mention Limp Bizkit in each track it gets irritating. Its a shame their are no tracks like Re-arranged though.... Still its gonna get tired really soon and new bands like Static-X, Pitchshifter and other in this new sound will soon dominate the airwaves. Expect Fred and Co to hang around a little bit longer.."
1,pick your ear,PICK YOUR EAR CHANCES ARE THAT LITTLE PIECE OF EAR WAX HAS MORE TALENT THAN LIMP (POST 3DOLLABILLYALL)
1,dissappointed,not good at all. i expected some rapcore but instead i got rap. that's right the second version of rollin' is a rap song that you'd hear on a party station. this is just party music. limp BiZkIt is not the rapcore i knew from 3 $ bill. this is just sad. party music for party people.
2,Ok when it came out,I liked this CD way back when it came out but compared to other rock albums this album lacks big time. Fred enjoys using MF in his lyrics for no reason. I mean I could give a care about the language in the albums I listen to but this guy was just saying it to say it. The songs are mediocre and better left unheard. If you want rock go buy any of KoRn's albums.
2,Bizkit Gone Bad...,"In my opinion, Limp Bizkit has taken a well proven formula, and completely [messed] with it. Significant Other was by far Bizkit's greatest album to date, but when i purchased this worthless table coaster i literally slammed it with a hammer. This is less than more indeed, and so is their new old songs cd. Both of these releases are worthy of my toilet and should have never been allowed out of the studio...man i hope that Wes is jamming to his even more terrible big dumb face cd...or perhaps his new eat the day tracks, lacking any talent or vocalist. Sure Wes has his own talent, but he never reaches full potential with a credible band. Bizkit makes me sick, and Durst does especially. Hot Dog was a track that i played a many times, just to remind myself how terrible Durst's lyrics are. Now, all of you, go out and forget the bizkit...for the forthcoming Bipolar disc will likely be the point of bizkit death..."
2,Never thought I'd say this but Get the Clean version,"I got the clean one when i was in like 5th grade and I loved it, but i just started listening to it lately and decided to find out what the real one sounded like so I downloaded the explicit CD. I hear the F word all the time at school but this is crazy! They probably think they're all bad and stuff for saying it but they are really good songs but they ruing them by saing the F word over and over again. It's not like it offends me or anything, it's just plain annoying. Download Hotdog, you'll see what I mean in 30 seconds."
3,"Dissapointing, but not totally worthless","Three Dollar Bill was a great debut, and Significant Other was a pretty good sophomore effort, but Chocolate Starfish leaves something to be desired. There are some good songs here, but overall the album stands as a dissapointment. Many of the songs lack the usual emotion Fred puts into his lyrics, along with the fact that many of the songs are downright annoying, such as Hot Dog, Getcha Groove On and the second version of Rollin', to name a few. There is, however, the usual goods from Fred and the crew. Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle) is a fun song to listen to, and most of you would probably also like My Generation, although I didn't. My Way is kinda good, but not the best. My two favorites are the MI:2 theme Take A Look Around, and also the most mellow song on the album, Hold On, which is a real change from Limp's style; one might even call it a ballad. Overall, though, I feel I got enough good songs to make this album worthwhile. Hope you like it."
2,Even the MI:2 theme can't save this peice...,"...""My Generation"" is another rally annoying song, along with ""Full Nelson,"" ""Getcha Groove On"" and almost every other song on this CD. Only 3 songs kept me from giving this 1 star. The rock version of ""Rollin"" is a pretty catchy, fun tune. Also is the extremely mellow ballad ""Hold On,"" something most fans of Limp wont like because it is so different for them, but I think it is a very good peice of music. And finally is the best song on this CD, the MI2 theme ""Take A Look Around."" Still, if all you want is that song, then buy the soundtrack to the movie. Unfortunately for me I bought this instead, and instead of getting another great album like 3 Dollar Bill Y'All, I got 3 good songs..."
4,"Album of the Year, I Don't Think So","First of all i want to say that i expected much more of this album, and of course, the band. Why???, because if you listened very well this cd you could noticed that some of the background music was very repetitive; the lyrics were just fine, but the music it's something out of place. Also, in comparisson with the other to albums, i can say this was a little more softer than the other two, that were more stronger in music and lyrics. But let me think this was just a little fall ,and that in their next producion they'll be more interested in the fans and making a better album."
3,"could have been better, but hey its not too bad....","the guitaring and music is nothing short of awesome on this album....the big downfall is the ""cry me a river"" mentality of Fred Durst..if it would have been either Chino Moreno or Daryl Palumbo or someone with a good lyrical style....this album would have been one of the best....but Fred Durst's blunt style ruins this album...but Wes Borland does some phat guitar lines...examples being ""It'll Be OK"" and ""My Way""....Three Dolla Bill was better, but this album isnt half bad....Significant Other was pretty good too...this is there worst..but not bad...they just need some new lyrics.i reccomend GlassJAw and Deftones.."
3,Good enough,"If you're stomach enough to face the 30+ barrage of 'F' words that adorn opening song Hot Dog, chances are you'll probably enjoy this album, a profanity-packed powerhouse of thunderous riffs and angsty lyrics seeming unsophisticated but strangely clever ie. ""Gonna do things my way/It's my way/My way or the highway"". Many people will see Limp Bizkit as a cartoon band; but anyway, if you don't then enjoy it anyway - though don't take it at all seriously."
2,so sad,"im sure all those 13 year old nookie fans out there will make this album go platinum. after hearing it myself, i found it about as entertaining as bsb's millenium album. limp bizkit the newest boy band, i would have never thought it possible three years ago!"
1,"Don't buy this if you own ""Significant Other""","The new LB cd is Significant Other re-released, except not as good. They should have called it Significant Other II. The music, rhythms, beats, echoes, even the lyrics - virtually identical. I like the LB, don't get me wrong, but I was expecting a little more creativeness on this one. I should have just bought another copy of Significant Other. What a disappointment. Save your money."
1,"This ""band"" has no talent and that is fact not opinion.....","Well the rap metal scene is uplifted by a new release by limp bizkit whose claim to fame is covering a george michael song. Why do these rap rock bands come out with a new album every year? Every album by bands from this genre sounds alike and it's not a good sound; rap and rock make a poor combo. The albums lyrics are nonsense. This is pure mtv fodder and I know that millions will be sold but what does that say about the state of music. Most critics agreee that the last half of the ninties musically was weak and that's when this rap metal thing began. I hope they go away but kids in this country are too stupid and worried about ""style??"" over substance. What ever happened to 80's alternative, how did that exellent music fade away only to be replaced by this garbage; it's sad and I hope that this trend dies a painful death...."
1,Were they kidding?,"Perhaps a more appropriate title for this album shouldve been ""We are whitetrash idiots who suck balls at making music""Fred Durst should be repeatedly flogged for spawining this crap.Here are some catchy lyrics for your next album:L-I-M-P Bizkit is real quere.You think i have no talent? Well i could crap out something that is better then these no talent ass clowns.This disc...is balls."
2,What went wrong here?,"What the hell? I go out to the store to buy the new Limp CD and I get this? This isn't a horrible cd, butit is a huge dissapointment compared to what it could of been. I've been a big limp fan since the days of Three Doller Bill Y'all, and I was a bit dissapointed with the release of Significant Other, but this CD takes the cake. Tracks like ""My Way"", and ""Getcha Groove On"" are the two stars in this review. Without them, this cd would be just another coaster for my coffee table. Buy it only if your a hard core limp fan. Otherwise, go pick up Three Doller Bill Y'all..."
5,HOW COULD YOU NOT LOVE THIS!,"This CD is simply amazing. There is no oter way to describe it! Wes Borland's amazing gutiar riffs, Sam Rivers blasting out loud bass notes, John Otto keeping a steady beat, while D.J. Lethal does his thing over at the turntables. But the most amazing thing is Fred Dursts voice, no one out there can sing like he can. Almost all of the songs on this CD are great, and if your a rap and Hip-hop fan, they're all great! The thing people complain about to much is how the lyrics don't make any sence. WHO CARES!?!? Almost no alternative music out there tells a story or makes sence, so shut up! This is a must, if you don't have it, get it!"
1,What Happened?,I don't know how it happened and why but CS&HDFW is really really BAD! Significant Other was a a GREAT album! But this new record doesn't do anything. It sounds like the previous. Oh and I don't think Fred Durst's voice is very good...at all. But I do like Wes's costumes/makeup.
4,This CD is off the sheezy,This CD is like techno alien music. It is cool. If you listen to the songs you will not get bored of them. I think you all will like this CD. Just buy it. If you don't like it give it to me. Limp Bizket is not like rap or nothing. All the songs are cool. I think so. I think you will like this. It's all good. I think so. You will probably like it. It's cool. Yes it's cool. It is so cool!END
1,I havent herd it yet,Could someone please post a review that tells me the difference bettween the regular and limited edition of this CD?
4,A real new approach to the fans by limp bizkit,"The beat, bass, scratches and wild pumping vocals really sets this disc apart from the previous 2 albums. Fred Durst has roped in the right artists to guess appear on this record like icp(2 provoke the hell out of eniemn) n method man(to keep the hip hop roots flowing) the songs are all jumping and some melodic. definately worth the money. the lyrics are fab and the songs are quite easy to digest. it has a bit of the rap metal element in them as well as the sound from disturbed to keep this record pumping. The only thing that was dissapointing was that there was no collaborationg with primer 55 a band that can repell this album into greater greatness. good this wes went back to the 6! too much of 7 string sound destroying good ole guitar cuture. may this be a turning point to rap metal and trigger the sound of orgy/rammstein inspired music."
5,Limp Bizkit,"This is a great cd.It is one of the best buys you can get.It has ""Rolling"" and ""My Generation"" and many more songs which are great.If your a rock fan,this is a definite buy."
4,not bad.... good going limp bizkit!,"this cd overrall was pretty tight especially for ya limp bizkit fans. but myself not a major fan but i did like this cd alot... good lyrics especially in ""hot dog"" the lyrics were kind of amussing to me because of the overuse of the F word. well to any rap and rock fans... give this cd a try... you might like it... well atleast i thougth this cd was great. Strange outro... 10 mins! oh well enough of reading this just go ahead and buy, preview, or whatever!"
1,This is Pure stuff,"I am very dissipointed in Limp for this cd I mean, Sicnificant Other wasn't the greatest cd in the world but it was a hell of alot better then this.The only song that saves the CD is ""My Way"" but that gets slaughtered when some DJ starts saying Cheak out the Melody like 500 times. However, I should of seen it coming ever since there 3 dollar bill days they have just gotten worse if you want a good Limp cd cheak out ""Three Dollar Bill for Y'all"" not this stuff that cd was the best they ever made."
2,"Get ""Significant Other"" instead","""Chocolate Starfish And The Hotdog Flavored Water"" (what a title!) is one big disappointment. There are only three good songs on this album, namely ""My Generation"", ""Take A Look Around"" and perhaps ""Rollin'"". Fred Durst's rhymes are very weak, half of the lyrics consist of the f-word. I only listened three times to this album, and after that never ever again. That's how fast it becomes boring.You'd expect an album that is by far better than this. If you don't own it already buy ""Significant Other"" instead. It's loaded with great tracks and more intelligent lyrics. I really hope their next album will be totally different from this. The band has great potential, especially DJ Lethal and Wes Borland. So, get a grip Fred Durst, and next time don't try to please the MTV-genaration, do what my generation wants to hear!"
1,BAD,"This cd is horrible all they say is f this and f that! it's stupid, save your money and run from this evil cd!!!!!!!"
1,Dont mess with NIN!,"I heard Rollin and My Generation and liked them. Then I heard Hot Dog. First i kinda liked it, thought it was catchy. Then, halfway through, I heard them make fun of 'NIN - Closer.' Thats a great song from a great band. Dont mess with it."
1,"It's sad to see what some people call ""music""","Has it really come to this? So-called ""rock bands"" are actually reasoning that instead of catchy melodies, hard-edged riffs, original song arrangements, emotional singing and screaming and infectious guitar solos, they'd rather try to fit as many ""f"" words into their lyrics as coherence will allow on top of a distorted, mid-tempo beat? This album really does epitomise everything that music should not be. All that this really is is some guy in a red baseball cap moaning about how life sucks in order to appeal to a shallow teenage market with some guitars in the background so that he can claim it's rock music. Avoid at all costs."
1,If Fred Durst were a moose...,"He would have only one antler. It would have green moss hanging off of it. The other would have been broken off by another moose while it was pushing him down a big hill. A very big hill. He would have gotten dirt in his big moose nostril and grass stuck under his big moose eye-lid.If not a moose, then maybe a fish. One of those very skinny fish that look big when you see them from the side, but then when you see them from head-on, they are really skinny.That's more like Fred Durst. That's more like LB. Looks big, sounds big, but really, it's paper thin. It's like a moose with one antler. Looks big, but it sounds bad with all that grass stuck in it's big moose nose. It's like an adolescent male with adiposogenital syndrome.It's like a fish."
2,Not enough oomph,I bought this unit to power a 12v 3A bilge pump for pumping out water in pool/rain-fly. I noticed when the unit ran for 30min it would shut down due to the thermal circuit but at some point it apparently shorted the transformer and would blow the fuse. Good for low amp applications.
4,"sturdy unit for things requiring more power than typical ""wall wart""",I bought one of these years ago for a Koolatron electric cooler. It has worked fine as a stable power supply for devices that need more current than an ordinary wall-wart baby power supply provides. This is a nice sturdy unit that has some heft due to the large transformer. The dual socket and terminal outputs are flexible for making up adapters connecting to various connectors.
3,Pyramid 5A power supply,"I used this power supply to charge my Lipo batteries for my RC planes. This power supply worked fine when I was charging at 3A continuous. However, the Voltage dropped to an unacceptable level when I tried to charge at 5A. Even 4A did not work very well."
2,"Nice, but not for continuous 5 amp","Bought for application using just less than 5 amps. While it does deliver 5 amps, it will only do so for a few minutes, then will shut off, resting comfortably for about 40 minutes, then back on. I needed to return as my application required 5 amps. Nice unit, but not for continuous use at rated capacity"
2,over rated power rating,"I bought this for a fire radio we are trying to use as a base station. Knowing a bit about power supplies tells me the transistor on the heat sink is only good for 3 amps, not 5. Probably a good 3 amp supply but don't expect more out of it than that."
3,Works like it's supposed to,"Worked for me. I measured output at steady 13.81 volts from both cigarette and binding post terminals, and my use only requires about 500mA so never tested its upper current limits. I was using it in my entertainment system to provide regulated voltage to my external DAC, which it did well and improved its sound. Unfortunately it also seems to cause a large amount of interference on the electric line. When it's turned on, my TV (on the same surge protector) gets a large amount of fuzziness that goes away the second I turn the Pyramind PSU off. Gets 5 stars for doing what it should, but loses two for interfering with other components. It's perfect if this is the only thing you're using, but less so if combined with other sensitive equipment."
3,"Okay, not that great.","I read some reviews that said that this power supply is definitely not 5A rated more like 3A. I bought it anyway because I don't need that many Amps and I need an isolated power supply. But it's true the voltage is regulated to not exceed 13.8 V, but the spec didn't say anything about it could go lower, actually below 12 V at 5A load. And yes you'll need a fan to run at 5A. So for me it's okay for my need, but if you're looking to load it anything more than about 2-3A then buy a stronger power supply."
1,Voltage Drops unacceptably @ 3 amps,I purchased this to use with a 25W ham radio transceiver. At first it appeared OK but when I spoke into the mic the light on the radio would dim slightly. I made one contact who said that my audio was terrible and another said it was all noise and not intelligible. I hooked up my multimeter to test the output of the supply. During receive it was a good 13.76 VDC. But on TX with it dropped to 10.8 VDC. I checked the current being drawn and it was 3.2 amps (on TX) - well within the supposed capability of the supply. When I would talk into the mic the the voltage would drop causing distortion. To say that this can do 12V @ 5 amperes is a lie. The voltage drops down way before it gets near 5A. I'd return it but I threw the box out. 12V paperweight maybe?
4,indispensible title on my computer bookshelf,"This has been one of those books that I constantly refer to. Not only is it good for learning some of the unique C things that apply to Unix, but you can also learn how to get around in Unix.

2,The silver modile edition is cheaper,"i found this same gun, but its in silver [ and its on amazon] for like $5, and now i think its like $3 or sumthing. u can buy 3 of those 4 less. the good thing about these is that the shipping was very fast [one day b 4 the earliest it would arrive] and these r good 4 a 1 on 1 match. u can tell if u get shot, if its on bear skin it will only sting for 3-10 seconds at most. the accuracy is decent. the worst part is the range, it is very short, only effective about 15-20 feet. i was playing with my brother 2day and i was on top of high deck and he was at the end of the yard about 30 feet away and i could barely reach him."
3,so-so,"these guns are okay, and they work better after you get new bbsbut they are good for the price (no accuracy) and the shipping is really fast"
1,this gun is not the one you want even though you love the price,At first you will think this gun is great but after 2 weeks or so it starts to jam the top slide will even fall OFF WHILE YOUR FIRING!!!i have tried super glueing it back toghether and it still broke apart after about a week.One last thing when you load it with .2 bbs they tend to get stuck in the gun so while you use it all you hear is a really annoying rattle sound.
3,disappointed somewhat,"It arrived damaged alittle, din't have wine in it and looked like alot of empty boxes, but again not opened yet, so we''ll see."
2,Disappointed,"We bought this for our son, and were excited about his first remote control car! However, after a month of playing with it, the gears became stripped and it wouldn't work anymore. We were very disappointed. The intention of this car is wonderful, but when you actually get the car, you realize how poorly crafted it is. I would not recommend this toy to anyone. When you spend money on toys, especially toys from decent toy manufacturers, you expect the quality to be there. I am sure this was tested over a period of time, so I am sure that they knew this car did not provide very high quality."
1,Would have been fun - if it worked!,"As stated in the other reviews, this would have been a fun toy if it worked longer than 5 minutes. We replaced the batteries several times, but it did not make a difference. My son got it for his first bithday and loved it, however, we had to get rid of it as it created more frustration than fun.Too bad!"
1,What a dissapointment,"I purchased this car for my son who is 21 months old and what a piece of junk. It works for 5 minutes and after replacing the 6 batteries it requires numerous times, I realized I am better off throwing it in the garbage. My son gets very upset when it does not work. I can buy a Hot Wheel for $.97 that will last 20 years. I did e-mail Chicco customer service about this, I'm waiting to hear back. What a hunk of junk."
1,Waste of money,"Very disappointed in this toy. First, it didn't every work right. We put the batteries in, but the remote never worked properly. Second, you are supposed to use the controls in the top portion, but it seemed they were programmed backwards, and in essence, only made the car scoot a little bit and in the opposite direction you thought. Finally, the top when put on is very durable, so my daughter can carry it around, but when she tries to take it off, it is very hard to do for the small kids. Overall, I would not buy this at all for anyone."
4,Owned for 4 years and its still running...Great Beginner RC!!,"After seeing the reviews, I decided to write mine, I see most folks who rated this toy a 1 star said it didn't work, maybe it was a bad batch but I've had this car for 4 years now and it still works like new!!! The only down part is the amount of batteries it takes. Both of my sons are 3 and 5 and they have ran the car through the wringer (threw it, hit walls, sent tumbling down the steps, etc.). I highly recommed this as a child's first introduction to RCs. Your kids will love it, out of all the toys I've given away or thrown out, this one and the Chico Jeep RC has been a keeper."
2,It didn't work...,"How horrible to get a toy that doesn't work. We learned a valuable lesson. Take it out of the box and try it before letting your two year old open and see it on his birthday. He doesn't know it is remote control so he just pushes it around, but what a huge disappointment."
1,Cute but crap,"I ditto the reviews that I've seen in this space. The car barely moves it's more than 5 feet away from the controller and after only two months one of the wheels no longer turns. Complete junk. I would like to say thanks to the reviewer who posted ideas on fixing the car, I'll give them a try, but considering what you get I have rate this car a zero, which is a shame because it's cute and there aren't many rc cars for two year olds."
1,not as good as it should be,I bought the girls version of this toy. Its really cute looking but WEAK even though I tried several new batteries. I wouldn't buy this again!
1,Not worth it!,My son received this car for Christmas. It worked the first time we used it but we noticed that if we forgot to switch the car to the OFF position when we were done the batteries would die. Each time my son wanted to use the car we would have to replace the betteries! The last time we tried to use it we changed the batteries in the car and the remote and it won't work. So now it's garbage!
4,Fun and tough,"My son LOVES this new toy. He asked for a remote control car for Christmas, but he is only 2 so we didn't want anything too fragile. This car and remote are built very strong. He drives it off the table repeatedly and it has yet to show any signs of wear. Good tough toy for a little kid."
5,great toy,"I love chicco products, this is great. I purchased this for my 20 month old son and he loves it. Very well made,the best remote control car i have seen in a long time."
1,Poor quality,"I was searching for RC cars for my now 4yo and saw this and can't believe it's still on the market. We had this last year and it lasted for less than a month. Although it's a solid toy, it just has no longevity, no matter how often you replace the batteries. The rare moments it did work, my kid had to practically stand on top of the car for it to move. Buy a different RC instead, this one is only fit for trash day."
5,Fantastic shoes,"I originally bought these shoes just for indoor soccer and found them to be so comfortable that they became my main pair of casual shoes. I agree with another review that says they take a short bit of time to fully break in, but once you have broken them in, they are extremely comfortable and stylish for regular usage and perfect for indoor soccer."
2,great looking- sizing very small,"I loved the image on the screen when I ordered them and I was not disappointed when I received them, visually that is. they were more the size of and 11.5 than 13.5 that i ordered, and I blame this on quality control issues at over-seas manufacturing sites. But the question must be asked, ""why is it that when you buy a basketball sneaker of the same brand, the sizing is more than adequate, but horribly off in a soccer shoe?"" I am a life- long fan of Adidas sneakers but found this item to be all flash and poor execution. If you are looking to purchase these online, I would either go an extra size up, or better yet, buy the original Sambas, which are still true to size."
4,Half size too small!,"I usually wear a size 11.5 shoe so that is the size I ordered. When I got them they were a half size too small so I had to ship them back to Amazon, at my own cost, for a refund. Other than the sizing problem, the shoes are great!Please note that the 11.5 shoes I wear are Reebok, Nunn Bush, and a few other casual brands. I think that the size is consistent with Adidas and Nike sizing but I usually don't wear those brands."
3,Not the best indoor socer shoe.,"This is a ugly indoor soccer shoe but it works. It is great for just messing around but not for playing an actual game. It is good for side kicks but that is about it, there r more problems with it than good things. It is horrible for juggling because the laces r not covered an it is not flat on top. It is horrible for running because it is stiff and the leather is really thick. It makes ur foot sweat really eaisily and it is not comfortable at all. They r really heavy too so it is hard to run. The only good things is it lasts a long time it has good grip. These shoes r good for just messing around or just wearing but horrible for games. I would save ur money for something better and it could be cheaper than this too."
2,There is one good thing about this CD Complilation,"This contains Ph.D/Jim Diamond's virtually unobtainable original ""I won't let you down,"" which is a classic synthpop ballad, once heard, never forgotten. Take it out as a blast from the past for anyone 38 to 49 in the year 2006 and you are in for a treat.Otherwise, the rest of this complilation is forgettable stuff you can get elsewhere at a lower premium."
3,mixed emotions,"The Retroliners are trying to create a sinister ambiance with their music but the product is a so-so dilution of surf-rock who's missing an important ingredient...creativity.But not too bad after all. Jean Lacombe,Montreal,Canada."
3,Just O.K.,"Found this product to be as advertised. However, found others to be less expensive and just as high quality. Too many products on the market in this class with questionable quality."
3,Charming! Wonderful art work.,"I read this story to my 7 & 8 yr. old boys. They thought it was cute, but not fast-paced enough for them. I thought it was relaxing and charming. I would recommend this book for an adult that likes a variety, or for a K-2 grader due to the slow, relaxed pace."
5,For Children from Two to Ninety-Two,"Once a week I volunteer to read books with children at the local library. VERDI by Janell Cannon is one of the most popular choices (Ms. Cannon'sStellalunais also highly popular). It seems that children of all ages enjoy this book about a little yellow snake who doesn't want to grow up and become a boring green adult. As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a great coming of age story. We always discuss the books after reading them and after reading ""Verdi,"" the kids always say something like ""even adults were young once"" or that ""you can still have fun when you're a grown up."" I also must comment on the illustrations, as they are exquisite - so colorful and detailed. Everyone just loves looking through this book again and again."
4,Verdi,I found this book to be very good. It talks about a young snake that doesn't want grow up. The story talks about his attempt to stay young. It is a very enjoyable story and is worth reading. So I suggest you read it!
4,Only option you have - DVD Tutorial is much better,"The Kontakt software has limited information available. While this book is very comprehensive, the best option to learn Kontakt is from the newly released tutorial DVD. It is awesome."
4,Many mathematical subroutines for you,"This book was written in 1981 and was written for the BASIC programming language. Because of this, most computer users will not be able to use this. However, computer enthusiasts may have some use for this book.The contents include plotting subroutines, complex variables (like spherical coordinate conversion), vector and matrix applications (like determinants and matrix inversion), random number generators (like Fermi distribution and Poisson distribution), and basic series approximations (like Taylor series expansions). In each chapter, Ruckdeschel describes the mathematics involved, then explains how the subroutine is written.If you need to write these kinds of subroutines for your work, this can provide a starting point for you. This was written before the World Wide Web became so popular so some of these you may now find on the Net."
1,definitively a bad book,"I have carried out several valuations in real life and am very familiar with the terminology and methods commonly used to valuate a company. This book unfortunately has not meet my expectations at all. It is very confusing and lacks of clear structure, especially when describing the DCF method, WACC and all other valuation key parameters. Extremely dissapointing."
5,Fabulous book! My cat loves it and so do I.,This author captures the essence of bonding with your cat through affectionate touch. Feline photographs are great and layout imaginative. Cat Massage is a book you will keep and refer to for years
1,For those who have NEVER had a cat...,"I would only recommend this book to people who have never owned a cat until now. This book is basic common sense and really not worth the money spent if you have already owned cats for years. If you have, then you will find pretty much nothing new in this book."
5,Oklahoma,"Great single for this 12 yr old country artist! Hes so adorable and definately knows how to croon out these great songs! The 2nd track is a song off his Christmas album, really great!"
4,music to slow down to,"The sticker on the cover says it all - music to slow down to. This is a hypntoic album and well worth the price if one is looking for a tasty bit of ambient electronic rhythms. Stay away if you are seeking a beat oriented downtempo, abstract jazz type of groove. A slow and unrelenting sound that paints itself around a room AGAI takes up seventy minutes and lures you in with its simplicity."
4,Very satisfied,I really like these earrings. I wear them to work and at home- they go with many of my outfits. Good quality for the price!
5,Great abrasives,I use my 16-32 performax to remove cup from boards before machining to build furniture. The abrasives last a long time (I keep them clean between uses though). I'm too lazy to buy generic rolls to cut to length.
3,enjoyable,"yes, i enjoyed this sci-fi film but you definitely have to be in a forgiving mood to enjoy this. shades of ""Them"" here and you'll simply love the ""posse"" when they come into the film. the actors give it their all and you can't ask for more than that."
2,Rubbish,"I picked up this movie with a number of other SciFi Channel releases and this one is not worth the time taken to view it,the plot is full of holes,for example why doesn't the director of the covert op need a helmet like his troops to protect his brain from being controlled.The redemption of Karen (the wife)is totally unbelievable as is the participation of the street gang who just happen to want to fight the government,and to top it off most of the acting is second rate,probably because the actors found the script as trying as I did."
5,Close to Gone With the Wind,"The Floridians was a wonderful book! I am a southern-rooted New Englander and gave it to a born and bred and raised Yankee friend who couldn't put it down. ""Margaret Uhler can really write!"", she said. This is a book full of colorful landscape and images of times past that make a wonderful backdrop for strong and colorful characters who move about the scenes of history in Florida, through the south and expanding even to Europe surviving the struggles of war and family. This could be a close second to ""Gone With the Wind"" if there were a David Selznick around. An all round real treat!"
5,Great Book,"Great Book! When there was work to be done,I had to force myself to put the book down. It was equally hard to leave it and go to bed. The characters seemed like real people,as indeed were. The author did an excellent job of describing everyday life in the years 1809-1883.I don't know of another family with such a riveting history, which came from actual family accounts. General Patton's portion of the story had beem preserved in his personal letters and battle reports. Great story!"
1,Boring Book,"This book went on and on about nothing important. I was verydisappointed in its structure. The book is not so much about Florida (of which I am a 7th generation cracker) but about how important the family was and their ""great"" socialization with the ""upper-crust"" of the world. It was very hard to stay focused and caused me to skip a lot of the book. I was looking more for history and events in and of Florida and most of the book was about their travels. I feel I wasted my money on this book."
2,Im confused,"I dont understand these guys. I remember them as being new-wave romantics, with their most well known songs, Birds Fly, and Love is a Wonderful Color, which are probably their 2 best songs. Their first album, I admit was decent, but after hearing this, Im glad I didnt get anything else by them. I mean, c'mon. They shouldve just stuck to what they did best, instead of trying to do metal, blues, and reggae-ish(!) pop. Im sorry, alot of this comes off as half-baked, mediocre pop/rock at times coming off as a bad REO Speedwagon or some kind of AOR rock, like they lost their way somewhere. The only reason to buy this is for their 2 greatest hits. Its not just one disc, ITS 2. 2 DISCS OF MEDIOCRE MUSIC. Go get yourself a decent Echo and the Bunnymen record or something."
2,Pray for an early thraw!,"Unless you are a die hard, and I repeat, die hard fan, save your cash and get MP3 downloads of the three songs that are worth hearing. Big disappointment!"
2,"Good resource, but only if you want to build his kit","I bought this book thinking it would tell me how to program my own robot, and maybe how to make one from scratch. It just tells you a little bit of the basics, them moves on how to build the robot on his site. But it is an excellent book if you can afford his kit and dont want to move on to anything very advanced."
3,Product was good,"This filter turned out to be fine. The product was as expected. I actually rate this a 5, but I cannot change my stars"
2,Poor Guidance and Outdated,"I used the Fodors for out trip to Italy in November 2005 and was very dissappointed with it. Since there are no pictures, it was very difficult to identify monuments. The descriptions of the various historical places were vague and unsatisfactory. We had to purchase additional guides while in Italy to help us better understand the sites/monuments. The prices are also outdated: almost all of the admission or ticket prices it quoted were wrong and less than the actual price. As well, the restaurants it recommended were dissatisfactory. Next time I will pick up a different book (not Fodors), one with pictures and more details."
1,ay jalisco no te rajes!,"The DVD quality is good, it has been restored, the negative and sound are good. This movie is a magnificent ranchera movie, a period piece, a master-piece. But I have the movie in video, and I am very unhappy, because the movie has been cut, of many beautifull scenes, many of them with ""Chaflan"" (Carlos Lopez) and Angel Garasa (Mala Suerte), how much been delected, probably 20 minutes or more. The quality and good transfer to the DVD are real good. The many, many scenes deleted, made the DVD a dissapoiment. A real pity ."
2,One more disappointment,"I have many tools. I probably enjoy tuning them and making them perform almost as much as making furniture. However, the Jet/Proformax 16/32 drum sander has continued to disappoint at every turn. These extensions are necessary to hope to achieve a smooth sanded surface, however they are clearly not sufficient. For $120 you get two metal shelves that with a great deal of fiddling, but no clear methodology, you can provide some crude, but much needed support on both sides of the sander. However, you now have an even more expensive sander that consumes very overpriced sandpaper rolls, and remains a huge challenge to smooth a panel. I keep trying to make this tool work well, but still find I can do a far better job with a hand plane or belt sander in much less time. Perhaps it is time to give up and sell the whole thing."
3,Hard to adjust.,"It took me the better part of two evenings to get these tables installed and adjusted properly. Even after I got them the way I wanted them, during use they didn't provide the positive support I was hoping for.I mostly just use them to keep the workpiece from falling to the floor."
1,Flimsy and ...,"I returned these tables along with the Performax 16-32 sander. (see my review titled ""Extremely Disappointing"") The problem with the tables is they can't be mounted to be co-planer with the bed of the sander. Instead, they tilt downward, away from the conveyor. They also don't align evenly with the conveyor from side to side. Aside from giving the illusion they beef up the 16-32, they are of very little use. Save your money and build your own."
3,A Real Pain to Adjust,"These need a design change that allows something other than a mallet to adjust them. As a retired machine shop supervisor, I could design something myself that would work well, but it's more trouble than it's worth, unless I have to repeatedly re-adjust them. I spent more than an hour screwing with them. Once adjusted they work fine, but installing them properly can put you in a bad mood."
3,"Not bad, but more of the same","In this novel, Nayland Smith declares that Dr Fu Manchu has become a slave of routine, going through the same sinister motions that he has been going through for years in his attempts at conquest. I think this comes out in the book too obviously.I greatly enjoyed the first three books in the series, full of suspense and intrigue. This present book is perhaps no less full of suspense and intrigue, but it's pretty much the same suspense and intrigue as before.If you're a Fu Manchu fanatic, I suppose you might as well read this book, but otherwise the first three novels make a nice set and I think I'd be content to leave the series at that. If you've never read any Fu Manchu this one wouldn't be a bad book to read, but the first books would do a better job of setting the stage for the characters."
5,"Great Price, Good Product,goos service","I have only bought this from this company but,sofar the service was fine,the product has lasted ! Mercedes Hisis."
1,almost content free and dangerously misleading,"This book can be summarized thus: the reasons to use SSFs are:a. Better leverage [false with portfolio margin]b. Tax avoidance [usually false, since the methods described by the author can be classified as ""constructive sale"" by the IRS]Everything else the author says is either exchange-generated boilerplate or would work just as well with ""SSF"" replaced by ""stock"".As far as I can tell, the main reason for the existence of SSFs in this day and age is that you can essentially do naked shorting with them [no locate is necessary]. Nothing is free, and in the case of SSFs, the spreads are much wider than for the underlying equity, plus you need to roll them, if you want to hold the position for a long time."
1,WAY 2 SIMPLE,"I agreed with the guy who gave this book a star. When I saw the book, it looks good. But when I started to read it, I realized more than 50% of the book are definitions. It is way too simple.Honestly, there aren't any good books on SSF."
4,Good Music at an AWESOME Deal! (4 Out Of 5 Stars),"I saw this cd set while in Bahrain for around the same price (12 to 13 bucks) and decided to get it and listen... and boy was i satisfied.I had heard of The Scumfrog by my good buddy Jason from the Worthington (hey buddy!), but really never hear his type of music and mixes. SIMMER is actually a 3 CD Set (Also there is the 3 CD Limited editon set, which i am reviewing) that includes the 2 CD Set EXTENDED ENGAGEMENT!This type of music was a refreshment to me as i love to take chances to new stuff. F KARMA is a great track as well as other titles on ""SIMMER"".EXTENDED ENGAGEMENT is worth this deal alone. Both continuous mix cds will get you going and in the mood to dance till you drop. Definitely some rock / tribal / trance influences can be felt.GET THIS 3 CD SET AT THE KICK @$$ PRICE AND SEE WHY YOU SHOULD BEWARE OF THE SCUMFROG! ITS WORTH IT!(4 Out of 5 Stars)"
4,help - how do you adjust these as I have lost the instructions,I have just got these for my daughter but can;t figure out how to adjust them - can anyone help?Kathy x
5,Outstanding value,"This full denim comforter has exceeded expectations! It is beautiful, very thick, and expensive feeling... all for only $49.99. My son loves it and it looks great on his bed. I am a very happy customer. My only regret is there was no box-pleated bedskirt to match."
4,An engaging and informative read,"Bill Powers in virtually unknown outside a very small community of people interested in applying control theory to understanding human behavior, an activity that can be traced backed to Norbert Wiener's influential work in the 1940's. Powers' obscurity is particularly unfortunate because his work is truly revolutionary and deserves a much wider audience. In this book he gives a typically lucid presentation of the basics of his application of control theory to understanding everyday behavior. It's a wonderfully clear exposition of his ideas and provides invaluable insights into what makes us tick. Perhaps in the next millenium academic psychology will catch up to Powers. Until this happens, you couldn't ask for a better guide than this engaging book."
4,Happy but,"I read one review where it said that this item does not set flush to the wall.... didn't pay too much attention, and ordered one, and yep, I get it now, it doesn't sit flush to the wall, there is about 1/4"" gap ............ It would be nice if they had made this with a reverse indentation in the back, so that it would sit flush with the wall......... That being said, I really like, in fact have now ordered my second one, so I guess I got past the ""not flush"" result... it works extremely well, where you have several of those charging cords, where they are kind of large, and block the outlets. All and all I am happy with it, and would not dissuade others from purchases, If you know what to expect, then you aren't disappointed."
2,Had to return it,"I could not get this outlet wall adapter to stay firmly against the wall outlet. I tried additional screws and played with it for a while before deciding I had to return it. It did not secure tightly enough against the wall and when plugging and unplugging outlets from it, it moves around and becomes loose so you have to use two hands to hold it in place and remove the outlet with the other hand. This did not work for me so I returned it."
2,Not as advertized. Cheap Chinese crap,This must be measured in the metric system. Did not fit a standard US GFI receptacle. Had to break the plastic alignment plug to get it to work.
4,More outlets in an instant,"Had a lot of small electronics for the same double outlet.This is big, but it fits securly over the existing outlet. So there is no need to have an external extension cord (any more)."
3,The product needs better description.,"From the description, it seems like the product will convert two outlets to six. But in reality, it only plugs into one and covers the other one. There is also a plastic probe in the middle on the side where the plugs are and I had to cut mine off in order to fit it into the outlet that we have."
4,"Works very well, the only improvement","would be to increase the vertical spacing between the outlets by about 2 inches (50mm) so that larger devices could be plugged in. It is no worse than other multi-outlet adapters but hey, just being a copy of others doesn't say a lot."
5,I like it.,"This is the second GE In-Wall Adapter I bought. The outlet can be permanently mounted into the wall with the provided screw, or it can be mounted over a faceplate. I've done it both ways. The the angled faces make finding an open outlet much easier by keeping some of the large bricks out of the way. I really like the clean look compared to a power strip. It works great, just as it should. I like it."
3,"Wish it stayed in better, but it does the job","It does as I expected or maybe slightly less. It does give you 6 plugs, but it comes out of the wall very easily. I suppose you could permanently install it, but being in an apartment setting that's not why we got this. Either way, glad to have more plugs in key locations."
4,Great adapter,I bought this adapter for my fish tank and couldnt be happier. I couldnt find any like this one in stores and the price is good too.
3,Unclear description: does not adapt from 2-prong to 3-prong,"The description wasn't clear, but to be clear, this does not adapt from 2-prong to 3-prong. It adapts 2 3-prong adapters making them into 6 3-prong adapters.As a product it is fine, solidly built, no complaints. I just wish the description was more clear on this."
2,"Good concept, not-so-good quality",I purchased this hoping it would solve the problem of needing additional outlets in one specific area. This is in an undisturbed area behind a solid wood nightstand. I find that that the items plugged in will just fall out after some time. The outlet recepticals are very loose and it applies to everything I have attempted to plug in from a phone charger to a clock to a lamp. I would not purchase this again.
4,Good idea applied.,"Someone was thinking, based on experience I presume.The sockets are separated far enough that you can actually use them all."
2,poor design,"I have to admit that the price was low, but I found the engineering of the device to be poor. I went to install one of these outlet adapters and as I screwed it into the plate, the screw popped through the device. As it turns out, there is a tube that the screw fits in and it is not well connected to the device. (note: I did NOT use a powered screw-driver!)The second issue is that there is only one plug on the back. Poor design there, but very cost-effective. I have half of a dozen Brinkman adapters from 10 years ago, and they are built like bricks. Can't find them anymore. I paid $9 for them.As for the GE product, I returned mine....."
2,Does not screw in for a tight fit,It works but I was very disappointed that it did not screw in tightly. Now its jiggles side to side a little. Would not buy again. And I would spend a few more bucks to get a nicer one.
3,bulky,This unit is a bit bulky to place in many indoor rooms. There are better products for wall hugging and behind furniture. This is best served in a work room or garage or those seasonal occasions like behind a Christmas tree.
5,"well-designed, quality outlet","This is a great outlet. As other reviewers have stated, it provides ample space for large power plugs without sticking out too far from the wall. It is well-made, and it comes with a screw in the middle to hold it on.It should be noted, as others have mentioned, that all the power comes from the top plug. If you want power from two separate plugs (for use in outlets in which one plug is on a switch, for instance), use something like theGE 54947 6-Outlet Grounded In-Wall Adapter, White. For me, though, having all the power coming from one plug is a benefit. I use an apartment in another country where the wall outlets are single. I merely break off the piece of spacing plastic on the bottom in the back, and I've converted a single plug into six! One of those things that is useful and well worth the money."
4,Not Good with a GFI Outlet,"Again (I just wrote another review on a similar product) this product works by having a center bolt that is supposed to replace the little bolt in your plastic cover plate. If you have a GFI, it isn't going to work as intended--you can try to put it in (the metal prong plugs) but they won't fit in very far, so it is not a very good idea. Other than that, for the money, you can upgrade a two outlet plug unit to a six plug unit. You have to take a Phillips screwdriver and pull out the one bolt (remove the plastic cover plate) and then put this unit in and put the bolt through the unit and bolt it into the main box. Obviously it would be a good idea to turn off the power to the unit before you are do this. (Electricity is kind of like fire; tamed it is great, loose it can be a killer; you don't want an electrifying experience.)"
4,multi-plug with side entry,This is a well made multi-plug. It is nice that it has side entry plug-ins. The only con would be that it only plugs into the top outlet and covers up the bottom one. This is only a problem when you have the top outlet that is connected to your light switches.
3,Bottom outlet is just plastic to hold into socket,My first one had 2 outlet plugs into the socket. This one is very cheaply made. Only the top outlet into the socket makes connection and splits it 6 ways.
2,Not the quality from a GE product,The plugs are very loose in the socket. This won't hold up over time. Not the quality I expected from a GE product.
3,Good product but it's not perfect.,"The power sockets around my house have 2 sockets on them. A couple of the top ones stopped working. Before fixing them I thought this would be a simpler solution. After received it, it turned out the outlet only will plug in the top socket as the bottom socket is used by the grounded plastic plugs.If the outlet is designed in a way can be plugged into any socket then it would be perfect.Otherwise it's a very nice compact outlet."
1,Too cheap,"I ordered four units. I attempted to install the first one and it broke in a really confounding way where the screw was passing through the unit and protruding white tube extended out of the back. I opened a second one, and it simply would not install flush with the wall. I gave up before opening any more packages. Avoid."
3,Deeper than I hoped,"I had planned to use this behind a dresser. The faceplate plugs would not be accessible obviously but the side plugs would be, and I figured this would make the plugs accessible.Unfortunately the product picture does not give an accurate impression of the depth from the face to the back. It's a little over 1.5 inches. This is much further from the wall than furniture generally goes. They could easily have made the profile less deep, but I guess they were trying to accommodate the fat transformer-style ""brick"" plugs.So for splitting a socket or for handling more than one transformer on the same outlet, this seems a decent product. I just wish they'd shaved a little off the depth; a third of an inch would have made a big difference."
1,Don't buy!,"Screw held in product by plastic tube. If you insert once it may work but if you pull it out the plastic tube holding screw comes out and won't go back, rendering the product useless."
1,Cheap Quality,Its very flimsy.bought two of them.The first one got damaged while tightening the screw.Difficult to remove and insert plugs.Looks as if it will come off the wall outlet anytime.
5,Solid and well designed.,"What can you really say about a prodcut like this and in this price range? It's either solid and exactly what you expect or a cheap piece of junk. This is solid and exactly what you expect. Wish it came in black but obviously I am not knocking it for that, I knew it was white when I ordered it."
2,Not thrilled,Not sure why it has a projection in the middle of the unit. Kinda of have to force it into the socket
4,"Nice design, comes with a screw, could fit closer to wall.","This was one of the few models I Looked at that came with a screw (even though others ""product shots"" showed a screw). It would be nice if the screw were ""captive"", I dropped them several times. I like that I have the option of having cords stick out along the wall, or out away from the wall.The down side is these really don't fit very flush with the wall, even with the faceplate removed and the outlet screwed quite tightly back into the wall. There's still 1/16"" to 1/8"" gap between the wall and the box. Not a huge deal, but would have been nice if it would fit flush. I'm worried about dropping something in behind there, but that's probably just because my mom once had a gold chain fall down along the wall and short out a wall-wart that didn't fit entirely flush. It apparently made quite the pop. :-) I bet I could fix this by adding a nice bead of white silicon caulking around the edge..."
5,The Woman She IS!,"This whole cd is the BOMB!! But I purchased it specifically for this one cut, ""You Can Make The Story Right!"" That jam is my s***! (The late great George Howard does a nice version of it as well.) All I can say is, it's songs like this, performed by the incomparable Chaka Khan, that make her, The Woman She IS!"
4,Very good album,"This is one of Chaka's best solo albums. Although it features early-90's production values, the strong songwriting and singing by Chaka more than compensate for the dated sounds.There is a fine mix of R&B; (""Love You All My Lifetime""), ballads (""Look At Me That Way""), dance-pop (""Facts of Love""), and even a reggae-tinged mid-tempo ballad (the stunning ""Telephone""). All the tracks fit well together, making this one of Chaka's most cohesive solo albums."
3,Does the job,"I bought two pairs of these gloves -- one for myself and one for my 9-yr-old daughter. The price was good and they do the job of helping heal our cracked hands and keeping the lotion where it should be. I washed them and threw them in the dryer. That may have been a mistake. They shrank and lost their shape. They're still wearable, but a little odd looking. I would recommend air drying them."
3,GLOVES,I ordered these gloves to wear overnight because my hands are very dry. I thought I was getting small but I got medium. They are so big I could fit two hands in them. They are made very well. Very good quality.
1,Defective and Unacceptable!,"I have small hands and could not find cotton gloves at my local pharmacies. I hoped these would meet my needs. Unfortunately, not only are the fingers way too long, the way the gloves are stitched together makes the fabric bunch up awkwardly and uncomfortably. These were definitely a waste of money -- and someone made a huge mark-up on these gloves which appear to have been hastily and ineptly constructed. (The box says in China.)"
5,Great Sandpaper for Rough Stock Removal,I use this genuine Jet Performax product for medium to high rough stock removal. It handles both smoothing rough sawn stock as well as dimensionalizing planned stock. In the past I have tried to use 120 and 150 grit for the initial passes but wound up with burn marks and streaks on the 4/4 cherry stock despite depth and speed adjustments. I now use the 100 grit for the initial passes and then switch to the 150 grit for the final passes on the cherry stock. The 100 gritJET 60-6100 100-Grit Ready-to-Wrap Abrasive Sandpaperalso works great on 4/4 popular and soft maple as well. Having already cut sections for mounting in my Performax 16-32 drum sander saves time and insures the right fit vs cutting from continuous rolls.
3,a movie like no other,"You will be hard pressed to find a comparable movie, and that alone makes this film worth the watch. Come on, pizza guys on mopeds, German crooks, and a taxi driver hero, with the wackiest car since the back-to-the-future-delorian. Actually just the pizza guys' parade featuring guys doing flips on scooters is enough to justify watching this film.If you find this watch it. You will totally flip out."
5,what an exciting action-packed surprise!,"very original and refreshing. once you got a great new idea and an opportunity to make it realized with good production team, then the success would be a certainty that no one could resist not to like it. this is the first of the 4 'taxi' movies and also the very best one, you just can't deny it. the combination of action, suspense, comic and crazy moments, good guys and bad guys, stupid cops and reckless taxi driver, well, what more ingredients you want to add into this hilarious and outrageous french cuisine? non, mon ami."
3,Not up to it's listed rating,"I bought this 10-12 amp model after reading all the reviews on the 5 amp model thinking this will surely work since it is only going to run a 12 volt windshield wiper motor at 3.5 amps, which drives the lead screw on my Sherline mini lathe. It would not even start the motor. As soon as I flip on the power switch to the motor the LEDs on the power supply go from Green-Ready to Red-Protect. So, for now I will continue to run the motor with my 8 amp battery charger as it works fine. I just wanted something different to power it. Returning it was a breeze. Within a minute Amazon sent me a RMA and UPS shipping label. First time I have returned anything purchased from Amazon and I must say it was very easy."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!,"I would give no (0/zero) stars if I could.I originally bought the Pyramid PS9KX 5A/7A Power Supply with Cigarette Lighter Plug for an auto tire pump I bought on Amazon (12 VOLT ELECTRIC AIR PUMP w/GAUGE for Tires Bikes Cars Air Matresses by RAD Sportz (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WEMMUK/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i01)). This one didn't provide enough power. But, I'd thrown away the box (FIRST LESSON: Don't throw packaging away until you are ABSOLUTELY SURE) - and the return window is 30 days or it becomes garbage so I had to eat the cost and toss the item. Stupidly, I bought another Pyramid product - the Pyramid PS15KX 10A 13.8-Volt Power Supply with Cigarette Lighter Adapter. This one wouldn't power the inflator at all.I've since tossed the pump and the first Pyramid power supply. I'm TRYING to return this item. In the end, after WASTING over $120 for this solution, I ended up going with the Slime 40025 ($52). We'll see how this goes."
5,Pure power at a great price.,"The Pyramid PS15KX 10A 13.8-Volt Power Supply with Cigarette Lighter Adapter is a very reliable power supply. It also protects against shorts and over current. This power supply will work with all 12v products that have less than the 10A current need. Don't be mistaken, you need 13.8v to power 12v products. This is the average voltage that most Automobiles supply on their battery and cigarette lighter plug. I use this supply to power dew heaters for my Celestron CPC 1100 Telescope. This is a well made solid built power supply. I am very satisfied with my purchase."
5,A Beast!,"This thing is a beast! Can't believe it shipped free, as it's dang heavy! Had a much lighter version that finally gave out, I'm going to assume that heavier means more copper, will last as long or longer than my previous power supply!"
1,Didn't work as advertised.,"The item overheated and shut down after a few minutes running 8 amps. Not one, but both of the units i purchased. I returned them both. Use the Tripp Light PR10. ."
2,below rated capacity,"I was using this unit to power a small cooler, 6 amps. Unit kept tripping and resetting. Had about a 50% duty cycle.. Using a recommendation from another reveiw, I installed a small pc cooling fan on top, to draw air past the heat sink as well as out of the case . Has run 10+ hours a day since then no problem. With out a cooling fan, there is a heat/reset issue. Just wish that they had incorporated a fan in the original design."
3,Neither here or there :-l,"This is a fairly interesting-ish book about one of the best players to have played the sport. However, I wonder why he wrote another book? Surely he doesn't need the money (unless it all went to alcohol). It's interesting to get inside his mind a little and see what he's all about, but it is all jumbled and mismatched and leads nowhere. I like him, but if I had read this first before buying, maybe I wouldn't have bought it. Only for true Rodman fans. Otherwise, skip it."
1,"Yeah, that about sums it up","Dennis Rodman should be extradited. To North Korea, preferably. Here's a suggestion: Let's trade him for that green unicorn the North Korean regime claims to have in its possession. We could release the unicorn in some wildlife preserve in Louisiana, to scare the hell out of Bobo & the Finding Bigfoot team. As for Rodman...well, I'm sure the racist, purity-obsessed Stalinist-feudal dictatorship of the DPRK is just the place for Mr. Bad As I Wanna Be.Although I frankly doubt it."
4,Completes the series,"Timeline of the rise and fall of one of NBA's greatest. The moral of the story is the dangers of fame-- this completes the tale of one exceedingly dramatic rise and fall from way too high.Reality Check: fame sucks.In other news: language easily accessible, a quick, enjoyable easy read. Book in decent condition after library life."
2,"smart cat,but tired book","Dennis Rodman is a Great Basketball Player&truly knows the game inside&out.also a Smarter cat that He often leads on.but this Book is just alot of loose thoughts that never goes anywhere. there are a few interesting moments talking His time in various spots during His Career,but nothing really new.still Dennis Rodman remains one of the most interesting Athletes Ever."
1,He IS dead.,"This clown said all he could say with his first book, back when it mattered, to some people, because winning basketball teams matter, to some people.Note that it wasn't published by one of the big fat publishers. They don't expect it to sell. So don't be one of the few fools who buy it."
1,All of the pages fell out,"I ordered this book because it was described as being in good condition. The first time I opened it, the pages began to pull apart from the spine of the book. All of the pages have now fallen out of this book, and I have not even read the first two chapters."
4,Love the moisture smell not that great,"I love the Shea butter moisture for my skin, but the smell is not the best. It's not offensive, but it's not the lingering fragrance I would love to have. Still trying the various fragrances but this one will not be on my ""can't wait to reorder list."". Love all the others I've bought and highly recommend this brand."
5,Pre de Provence soaps,Although these soaps are a bit pricey...I treat myself to them from time to time...They feel and smell fantastic and they do last a decent amount of time.
1,Very disappointed,"The publisher promised ""witty & warm"" I found nothing close to either. In my opion,the book was pooly written, no charm, humor or even believable. The setting was Montgomery Alabama, 1900,it could have been LA, Chicago or New York and almost any year with the lack of real reference to the time and place. The author tried way too hard to come up with unusual names for her characters to the point that it was ridiculous . I just didn't believe the characters and didn't care."
2,Not Enough Elvira.,"Not Enough Elvira. She should at least made appearance to the Playboy Manison. With her show. She had seen the movies, that she's making comments on. So shouldn't she have gone to the manison to see the Haunted House?"
1,Playboy present Halloween spooktacular?,best to watch this one without any sound. I was expecting more of Elvira (why is she on the cover if she's not in it that much?). Basically it's a lot of how they set up his party and a bit (just a bit-not nearly enough) of the scantily clad women. This was disappointing.
5,THE VOICE OF AN ANGEL!!,"I fell in love with Jewel's voice since the first day that I heard her sing live in concert. I think that Jewel's songs are very good because she expresses her feelings through them. Everything on this track is just amazing. If you have this album,or thinking of getting it, then you will notice that she sings a lot about her mom and dad, she really is a family person. She also sings some songs in German(not included in this album). If you loved Jewel's previous albums, then you will just love this one more. Jewel sings 62 songs in this album, and all of the tracks are excellent. You better get this amazing album, and you will never regret it, believe me."
4,Great debut!,"I love this album have had it for years and have every one of their albums all worth getting! This old time hard rock like ac/dc, krokus, and others like them!Evry song is good and gets you pumped up and singing along with! Just a fun rockin' good time!!!"
5,New CD on Acetate Records in March '06,"Check out the NEW Cd from Rhino Bucket on Acetate Records in March '06www.rhinobucket.comwww.myspace.com/rhinobucketwww.myspace.com/rhinobucketmusicRhino Bucket T-Shirts available on www.rhinobucket.com and click on the ""SWAG"" sectionCheers,2006-""The Year Of The Rhino"""
2,Strong beginning...contrived conclusion,"As with the second volume of the Zuckerman trilogy (Zuckerman Unbound), Roth begins in fine fashion but gradually loses steam. The result is an ending that seems less a result of the natural actions of his characters and more a testimony to Roth's own boredom or fatigue with his subject. Would have been more effective as a short story--as a novel it seems bloated and a bit flimsy. Roth has done far better than this."
3,They get you with shipping fees,"The throw blankets are ok - what I expected, nothing more.But PB sure get you on shipping fee. Charged almost as much for shipping as the blankets cost. I should have noticed before I finalized the purchase."
5,Very informative and helpful,"This book is excellent for information on starting a church library. It has information on the Dewey System, labeling, cataloging, and much more."
2,AMATEURISH,"I am an attorney practicing law for many years. The Review book is full of important information that I assume is relevant to the Broker exam. I will be better able to answer that after I take the exam. However,the minutia of information is so extensive that it becomes simply impossible to remember all of it. In addition, it is replete with typographical errors, obvious mistakes,questionable correct answers to quiz questions and simply NOT a professionally prepared product. The editors clearly did not proof-read the text, even after so many editions!In one word -AMATEURISH!"
2,There are so my grammatical and math errors its a difficult read. DO NOT BUY!,"If they cant bother to fix the plethora of grammatical and math errors in the book its going to take you for a ride. The book also is not very good at segmenting concepts, sometimes one can be reading and then find themselves in a new concept thinking it may or may not be an extension of the first concept. The typos are the most frustrating. If they cant edit it correctly and be sure that its a quality product, they dont deserve anyones business."
4,Very Useful Book!,"I purchased this book to supplement the classes (and their corresponding textbooks) that I completed in order to obtain the state broker license. This book was great assistance, since it summarized well the main concepts to focus on for the exam. The sample test questions are good, but in parts, could have been written better. If you supplement this book with the book written by Minnie Lush, California Exam Guide, you should be comfortable with the state exam questions."
3,"OK,","Online study guides worked better and seemed more up to date. The info in this was relevant, but the online test exams were spot on. If you can't get online access or do better with a paper book than a computer screen, this book will do."
4,PLAYS IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT!,"MY SON RECEIVED THIS LAST CHRISTMAS WHEN HE WAS 6 MONTHS OLD. WE KEEP IT IN HIS CRIB AND TILL THIS DAY WHEN HE WAKES UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, INSTEAD OF CRYING FOR A BOTTLE OR JUST FOR US TO COME GET HIM HE PLAYS WITH THIS TOY! IT IS A BIG LAUGH IN OUR FAMILY BECAUSE AT LEAST 4 NIGHTS A WEEK WE HEAR HIM PLAYING ""HIS PIANO"" AS WE CALL IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT!! HE ENTERTAINS HIMSELF TILL HE GOES BACK TO SLEEP- WHAT A RELIEF FOR US! MY BROTHERS 2 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER STILL WAKES UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, SO I SUGGESTED HE RUN OUT AND GET THIS TOY! I LIKE PLAYING WITH IT ALSO, AND THE COLOR AND LIGHTS ARE VEYR NICE. IT IS NOT LOUD AND ANNOYING LIKE SOME TOYS. IT IS ALSO PRETTY DURABLE. 1 YEAR AND STILL GOING STRONG!"
4,I needed a higher drawer!,"The idea is great, but wish they made a size taller for those of us that want more storage space. I have a plantation bed that could fit a 9"" high drawer and would have suited me better. The drawer idea is great, though."
5,"apart of the vital information collection !""",Adifferent format and challenging to play because it is the first one i have and one i have always wanted the title of course.
3,A great manual for teachers and intermediate students,"Mr. Vezzoli's book is a great book for brushing up on proper execution of the aides, collection and extension of the horse through various gates, and why certain seats are used for different styles of riding. If you can find this one in a used book store, add it to your home collection."
3,A teacher and intermediate student's manual,"I read this book when it was first issued. It was an excellent supplement to the riding lessons I took at the time. It begins with the basic chapters of confirmation, equipment and gaits of the horse, then gets more technical as horse's collectiveness,extension, and rider's postioning are discussed. Detailed description is given of the proper leg and rein aids for each exercise between horse and rider. I still reference the book and it is a permanent part of my equestrian library. Illustrations are great, photography could have been better."
4,Does the job at a low cost,I didn't expect much at that price; however it exceeded my expectations. The pump does the job just fine and the gauge is fairly acurate.
5,Just in the neck of time,"This pump arrived on time and was packaged professionally. But here is what really kicks a little you know what. My friend purchased a new bike, he got a flat tire and was just bummed out beyond my personal understanding. I was able to help him out because I had a tire pump that just arrived so I was able to try it out immediately. It worked like new, and to tell the truth, a tire pump is a must for anyone biking in the city. Ths product is something that will pay back over and over if needed."
2,It does not work on all bike tires,I was very dissapointed that the valve on the pump do not work on my bike tires that require 125 of air pressure. Does any one know how to make the pump work with all bicyles tires
2,Original release 1980?,How could the soundtrack be released in 1980 when the movie was originally released in 1984? One of my favorite movies but the released soundtrak stinks - 4 or 5 songs? A lot more music in the movie than that.
3,the difference between the two,on the two pictures provided the one the above people are talking about must be the one where it shows the picture of molly ringwald and the guy with the cake.. that is only some songs from the movie (which it states on the cover under the title) where as the white cover is the actual soundtrack and contains all the songs.looks like they put out a sampler
4,Great Album!,This album was very underrated. It was a brilliant collection of songs to show El's diversity and creativity.
3,Pretty Good very Underrated Cat,"this Album brought El Debarge&Maurice White together&Others on board.""After the Dance"" with 4 play&Patti Labelle Singing with El are showcased.this is a tight Marvin Gaye cover.""You know what I Like"" with Chante Moore is catchy.El showcases His Many Talents as a Writer,producer,arranger&Instrumentalist here.there is a Strong Marvin Gaye feel along with a 70's vibe.some interesting Cuts here."
4,Great driver. Wish it fit on my drill's bit holder.,"Great little tool to have in your toolbox. Inexpensive, yet seems to be quality-built. I just wish it would fit on my drill's bit holder. It is too long to securely latch in there."
1,Had to change this to 1 star. Buy a Ryobi instead.,"The thing cracked and swallowed a bit. Gar-bahgge. I have a Ryobi cheapo for the last 10 years. I bought this one for a second drill. After 5 days use, using a DeWalt drill, it cracked. As we write on boxes in the office so the cleaning people will pick them up... ""Basura""! I sure wish I could change my stars. Skip this accessory."
1,One star is too high...,"These things are 100% trash. The first one broke and I thought it was a fluke (the extender portion was locked half-way back and the bit was useless). I gave them another chance and bought a 2-pack (large and small) from the local Home Repo store. The short one drove maybe 20 screws and the guide locked back all the way in. I tried to free it with some pliers and it shredded. Spent a day and a half with the longer bit driver and it started to bind up and not glide back as it should, gouging my wall. I held the guide with my hand and spun the drill to free it up and the whole thing went to pieces. I had a handful of bit extender parts and circlips in my hand. Dewalt should be ashamed of themselves for making these. Although I'm a contractor, they all broke under typical DIY conditions. Save your money and buy the offerings from Makita, Bosch, or Milwaukee."
4,SCREW TIP,"DEWALT IS THE ONLY ONE THAT HOLDS UP TO THE NEW STYLE IMPACK SCREW DRIVERS THE LONGEST BUT EVENTUALLY DOSE BREAK. I LIKE THE FACT THAT IT HOLDS THE SCREW AND YOU CAN HOLD SOMETHING ELSE WHILE YOU START THE 4"" DECK SCREW.NICE TOOL BUT A LITTLE PRICY..... THAT WHY I GAVE IT A 4 STAR"
4,"Just like its cover, it's aggressive!","This first release of Icon's is definitely their best! I personally enjoy ""World War"" and ""Under My Gun"" the best, but the entire CD kicks! Unlike their next album, this one remains hard and true to metal form! Get it now!!!"
4,Unique Debut,"While many prefer the polished ""Night of the Crime"", this was Icon as a metal machine. With ""Killer Machine"" and ""Under My Gun"", the brilliance of guitarist Dan Wexler showed a unique sound that was ahead of the somewhat mundane rising LA scene at the time. Worth getting. Only the song ""I'm Alive"" is weak here. Check out the instrumental ""Iconoclast"" for true magic."
5,A TEN STAR CLASSIC !!!!,"One of my all time fav's, I rank it right up there with Black Sabbath Vol 4. Every song rocks - 1 ballad. Dan Wexler is a guitar genius, as he now plays with Alice Cooper & others, could you imagine Alice Cooper singing ""World War"" live ?!?! No metal collection complete without this one!"
3,INCOMPLETE,THIS CD HAS SOME GOOD MOMENTS IN IT BUT IT'S INCOMPLETE. IT GETS BORING AT TIMES AND THE MUSIC IS NOT AS TIGHT AS THEIR OTHER CD'S. NIGHT OF THE CRIME MAKES THIS CD LOOK LIKE A PRACTICE SESSION. JUST AVERAGE.
2,This would work great if I lived in a doll house. I had no idea it was so SMALL.,Very small. I'm not sure what I will use this for. I thought I was getting a much larger broom. Pix is deceiving.
3,Iva's Voice is in Top Form,"3 and a half stars on this double cd set. ""berlin tapes"" is a cover album, iva's voice has never sounded better!, the selection is a little odd, sung differntly.highlights ""complicated game"" , ""loving the alien"", ""dissapointed"" and even the sinatra cut "" all the way"". Boxes is a ""mostly instrumental album"" very dreamy, ambient music, nothing spectacular. oddly ""no promises"" and ""regular boys"" are here oo, prior to ""measure for measure"" album. New icehouse fans should get this once they get a few Other Icehouse albums, FIRST."
1,HONESTLY - DO NOT BUY THESE!,"I've reviewed a lot of products for Amazon, and I love most things made by Jet, but these are JUNK! Please don't waste your money. The backing paper is cheap, and it tears easily. Two of them ripped cross-wise in their clamps as soon as they were installed and I turned on the drum, causing them to rip loose (luckily the cover was closed!!) A third one ripped laterally as I was unwinding it to install it. So out of a box of four, only one could be be used. I returned the other three for a refund, which Amazon was good about. I've had my Performax sander for years, and have never had any problems with genuine Performax paper. Jet - you really should be ashamed of yourself with this one!!!"
4,Drum Sander Wraps,I'm pleasantly surprised these last as long as they do.However I don't suggest using even the coarsest grit to remove paint. They load up with paint.Overall I am quite pleased with these abrasive wraps.
1,Jet Should Be Ashamed!,"When you purchase a high quality machine, you expect high quality parts to go with it. At almost $12 a roll this sandpaper is a joke. It tears when you put it on the machine, if and when it stays on the machine. The quality is so spotty it's just lack of concern on Jet's part. I wish there was someplace else I could buy sandpaper, but I'm stuck."
3,Carrie 2,"I ordered this and it played great but after the movie was over, the movie couldn't come out my VHS. And it broke, therefore, it can't be watched again, but I like this movie."
3,Not the best but it was okay,I recently bought this movie and saw that most of it's setting was at a high school and high school kids. Not that that's bad but this did make it get uninteresting in some areas but towards the end was a freaky/scary ending where the main character unleashes her telekinetic powers at a party where they were lots of high school kids around that aparked her rage. I've heard from a lot of people that Carrie part 1 is good but I saw it and it was in a 1970s or 80s setting which I didn't like so I wouldn't recommend Carrie part 1.
5,EXCELLENT! A PERFECT SEQUAL!,"I luved this movie! I recently rented this one, BUT I WAS WRONG! I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT THIS ONE! THIS IS MY 5TH FAVE HORROR MOVIE! BUY IT!"
4,Better Than I Thought,"I was pleasantly surprised when I took a chance by renting The Rage: Carrie 2. I am an avid Stephen King fan and have seen and read the original Carrie. It was good; much better than I had expected. Don't get me wrong; it's not the best movie ever made. There are pieces of the plot that are a little far-fetched. But in general, I found it to be a very compelling story of teenage life. The lead characters, played by Emily Bergl and Jason London, were very strong in my opinion and the story was gripping. I was so impressed that I actually watched it twice. It's so much more than just a horror story. It's definitely worth seeing if given the chance."
4,2-4-6-8 who do we appreciate?,"This sequel to the horror smash 'Carrie', is yet another teen horror flick. However, with one-liners and special effects, this seems to be an improvement. The 'star of the show' Emily Bergl, gives a captivating performance as this year's traumatised teen. The support cast were average, and Amy Irving seemed to be a disapointment this time. Special mention goes to the twin of Alicia Silverstone, Rachel Blanchard (Clueless and Sugar and Spice) and Charlotte Ayanna (Jawbreaker) for playing the 'teen bitches' with a little more class than expected. As Monica (Blanchard) says ""She should get extra points for being so skanky"", I would have to give this film extra points for being so daring. It's not easy to follow up on such a hit, but I think they did a pretty alright job. Though good, I have seen better."
2,it depends if you saw the original or not...,"if you saw the (absolutely incredible) original 'Carrie' then you know that this movie is such a piece of garbage that you should not even breathe in its general direction.If you haven't seen the (absolutely incredible) original 'Carrie' then for you, you little moron you, is an awesome horror movie where everyone dies.bottom line: this movie is NOTHINGNESS compared to the original carrie but AWESOME when its NOT compared to the original carrie.Worst part:basically the same exact thing happens in both movies, with the exeption of the suicide in carrie 2. Outcasted girl with telekenisis gets tricked then kills everybody using her power, including herself, with one survivor (i think there was 1 survivor in carrie 2 but im not sure) but in the original carrie, everybody died at school, while in carrie 2 everyonne died at a party.TELL ME IF IM WRONG. that's all i have to say. thank you for reading."
2,NOTHING BUT A ROUTINE UPDATE OF THE ORIGINAL,"YEARS AFTER THE EVENTS IN ''CARRIE'', ANOTHER BULLIED GIRL [EMILY BERGL] UNLEASHES HER TELEKINETHIC POWERS AGAINST HER FELLOW HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO PICK ON HER ALL THE TIME. HAS SOME GOOD ACTING, BUT NOW THEY'VE TAKEN THE CARRIE STORY AND TURNED IT INTO YOUR AVERAGE MODERN-DAY TEENAGE HORROR FLICK. THEY COULD'VE DONE BETTER THAN THIS. FANS OF THE ORIGINAL FILM WILL MOST LIKELY BE DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS SEQUEL."
2,so-so sequel...,"The sequel to the 1976 film based on Stephen King's novel, ""Carrie"" seems sort of like a reason to bring back characters who get a gory death. But, it plays reasonably well, with Emily Bergl marginally well playing Rachel, Carrie's half-sister. It seems like a watered-down plot of the original ""Carrie,"" with lots of gratutious sex, nudity, and gore than the first, but it seems to be a sort of shadow to ""Carrie,"" more than a sequel, like Roger Ebert said.The only good thing about this is that it has Amy Irving reviving her '76 character Ms. Snell, the only main character left living at the movie. What happened to Rachel, well, you'll have to see the movie for yourself...This is only a movie for star watching (Mena Suvari ""American Beauty,"" Zachary Ty Bryan), die-hard Carrie fans, people who like it because of the nudity and sex in this film and undemanding fans of cheap gore and predictable chills.Rated R for sexuality/nudity, graphic horror violence and gore, and for language."
1,This was nothing like the first one,This movie is stupid. It was nothing like the first one. A lot of the scenes were boring and it seems like they added some of the scenes to make the movie longer. This movie would probably be 50 minutes without those added pointless scenes.
2,Bit boring dont you think?,"Yes, it has it's thrills and spills, but the first three-quaters seem so go on forever; this plus the whole supposed ""father"" idea, ending up in nothing more than just a silly drawn out sub-plot? Please? What should have been an incredibly sexy movie, focussing much more on Carrie's abillities, just seems to totaly miss the point in this ""bore-and-snore""."
4,Good movie - bad DVD transfer.,"The DVD of Carrie 2 is mediocre. You can see pixilization in the backgrounds, which detracted from my viewing pleasure. There were also some spots where I saw some mpeg splotchiness."
2,Minor horror film won't displace original,"In-name-only sequel of sorts, as the new girl's name is Rachel, has ""Carrie"" survivor Sue Snell (Amy Irving) as a high school guidence counselor with - bingo! - Carrie White's half-sister Rachel (Emily Bergl) as a student. Snell and good guy jock Jesse (Jeremy London) attempt to help her while all the other mean kids pounce, but not quickly enough. Story updated for '90's audiences has marginal results, and certainly not in a class with the 1976 film. Sissy Spacek declined a cameo."
3,If You Like These Types of Movies,"The Rage Carrie 2 was okay. It was gory; heads rolled and a man's genitals were ripped out. The story line itself was okay, but was too similar to the first one. It was more like a remake of the first movie than a sequel. It would have been better if there weren't so much gore in it. And the sex scene was unnecessary, really. Movies tend to be better if there is less gore and more is left to the imagination. All in all it was okay, but kind of cheesy."
1,Stupidest horror sequel ever made.... a true embarrasment...,"This movie was the worst thing that I have ever seen in a long time. The acting was good, and the plot could have worked, but the final result was just horrible... plain horrible. No beyond horrible. Not only was it boring and dull.... it was pointless. The black and white shots were completely unneccessary and the ending was just ridiculous. This movie was bad, terrible... and stupid.... only a 10 year old would find it 'cool'."
1,Atrocious,"Atrocious sequel to the big horror hit ""Carrie"" from the late 70's. The original written by Stephen King was a complete success and this frankly isn't. It is 24 years later and still the scars from that night where everybody met the real Carrie White exists. Now, out of the blue, some producer decides to write a sequel! Why? The plot is very thin. Emily Bergyl plays Rachel, a girl with similiar powers to Carrie (played by Sissy Spacek, her debut movie) and things start to get a little out of control. Amy Irving, one of the only survivors of the first film reprises her role as Sue Snell, something which kept me watching (unfortunately) Very predictable, which should have turned out to be a made for Tv movie. A disgrace to Stephen Kings line of best sellers. Before I go, let me ask this question? Why do people create sequels to King's bestsellers? I've said enough...."
3,Don't measure up!,"I thought this sequel was okay but definately not as good as the original. Such classics like Carrie, Amityville, Exorcist, Night of the Living Dead should remain what they really are....... Classics! Every horror classic should not have to be remade just to please this short attention spanned generation. In most remakes, it seems like they do more harm than good to the movie and the original still get the highest rating."
4,A good Sequel or remake?,"Carrie 2 is a good movie about Rachael (Emily Bergl) and how she lives with mean Foster-Parents. All she has is her Dog(A Basset Hound)and her best friend Lisa (Mena Suvari). One day at scholl Lisa commits suicide by jumping off the school and onto a car. Rachael finds out Lisa did it because of popualar people. Rachael herself is also tormented. The tormenters are Mark(Dylan Brunan)Eric(Zachary Ty Bryan)Tracy(Charlotte Ayanna)Monica(Rachel Blanchard)and Brad(Justin Ulrich). Strangly Rachael is falling in love with Jesse (Jason London)a popualar jock. Amy Irving is also in this as Sue Snell from the origanal. At Prom Rachael is finally made crazy. She uses her psycic powers to kill Mark,Eric,Tracy,Monica,and Brad. She also kills many more prom goers. I thought it was a great movie."
5,"""Great Movie""","""The Rage...Carrie 2"" is a worthy sequel to the 1976 blockbuster that starred Sissy Spacek. Released in 1999, ""Carrie 2"" follows the story of Rachel Lang, a highschool introvert being harrassed by her classmates, mainly male jocks out for a good time. After being accused by the boys for reporting their devious behavior to the police, Rachel is threatened and tormented until she can no longer stand it. She, like the original Carrie, possesses telekinetic powers and she uses these powers to wreck vengence on her tormentors. Amy Irving reprises her role from the original ""Carrie"" film. The DVD is double sided with both full and widescreen presentations and there are a slew of bonuses including an alternate ending, extra scenes, audio commentary, and a collectible booklet. Although out-of-print ""The Rage...Carrie 2"" is a must-own for everyone's horror movie collection."
2,weak and disappointing,"As far as sequels go, this one is average but it does copy some of the same scenes and story as the original ""Carrie"". Not a bad show, but not as good as Stephen King's ""Carrie""."
4,Clever. A Suprisingly Entertaining Sequel.,"Alright, so the story is a little far-fetched. But what does that matter? The acting in this tragic/horrific tale is almost just as good as it was in Carrie. Emily Bergl is great as the troubled Rachel Lang. She lives up to the performace Sissy Spacek delivered in the original. The ""kill the teenagers"" sequence at the end is much more graphic than it was in Carrie 1. Overall, this is a good movie, and could be watched by anyone, espically fans of Brian De'Palmas original."
1,"As Simon Cowell would say...""Absolutley Dreadful""","I really wish that i could give this film a ""0"", but too bad about that. No, really, it was HORRIBLE. The first film was what i would say a million times better, literally. It was even worse than Godzilla. So, Don't watch it, it will only wreck the way you watch movies."
1,Not even good B-Movie camp!,"If you were expecting to see a fascinating sequel to the horror classic ""Carrie,"" well... okay, none of us expected anything of the sort! I went in with few expectations, expecting the flick to be a cheap but fun ""shunned chick gets her revenge"" bit. Maybe I would see fun campy movie, maybe a cool albeit lowgrade supernatural romp. Yuck---this flick doesn't even pass as good camp! The villains are too ""over the top bad,"" the dialogue lame, and the ultimate set-up to humiliate the tormented heroine is so far fetched. Fun firework show during the climax, but seems like the rest of the movie was pure after thought. ""Carrie 2"" seems like one of those flicks that some B-Loving fanboy/filmmaker tries to produce with the specific intent of making a ""wacky guilty pleasure classic;"" those usually make for the worst camp! Whatever the intent, this movie falls flat."
3,Not much has changed...,"The sequal isn't all that different from the original except that Rachel appears to have great self esteem and sticks up for herself.The mothers in both movies are mentally unstable or insane, both Carrie and Rachel are outsiders, both had powers, both are in high school, both have popular girls out to get them, and both kill everyone along with themselves but managed to spare one classmates life in the process.Part two seemed more like an updated version of the original. A sequal is a continuance of the original. This one was not.It could have been so much better."
2,Not the best but give it a try,It was an ok movie but its not the original.The prom scene is way better than the one in CARRIE and this movie does have lots of gore the prom scene also rips off the nightclub massacre in HELLRAISER 3.For some reason this flick reminds me of the movie HELLO MARY LOU PROM NIGHT 2.Just give it a try and see if you like it.I hope they make CARRIE 3.
5,Great Movie!!!!!!!,I saw this movie it was great!!!It is mostly about a girl who has telekinectic powers which means she can move things with her mind.Sound kinda boring?Its really not that bad of a movie.But if you are looking for a thriller it is not that great because its not that scary but I still loved it!!!It is one of my favorite movies!!!Emily Bergl does a great job playing Rachel.I give it 5 stars and I defenitely think you should watch it!!!
4,One Of My Favorites!,"Emily Bergl(Rachel Lang)did a great job and fulfilled the part as the raged girl. My school needs to watch this film especially my principal. The reason for the R rating was some nakedness in the boy's locker room. Much Violence at the end. One Of my favorite parts and some profanity and sex game issues. That would be so neat to make a Carrie 3, this film is good, but it kind of scares you in the beginning, but once you go through it the endig seems to be the best. The more blood the better. I would recommend some schools should see how much torture kids go through. Alone 160,000 kids stay home from school because of being teased, bullied, or humilated. I would recommend it. You know it was one of my favorites."
4,Great Movie!,This movie is GREAT! Rachel Lange (Emily Bergl) is very cool when she attended in the party! It's a bit of boring in the beginning. When you see at the last part it's amazing! Don't miss this movie! Check it out!
3,Mat's swan song uncharacteristic but fine nonetheles,"The bad news is that All Shook Down is not truly a Replacements album. The great news is that it is a Paul Westerberg album. Many longtime Mats fans, already jaded by the glossy ""Don't Tell A Soul"", probably ran screaming when they heard the fine tunes on this effort.Even though it ain't really the Mats, this CD has some of the best songwriting Paul has done. 'Sadly Beautiful' is an excellent tender ballad. 'Nobody' and 'One Wink at a Time' are also great songs. This CD also is a great example of Westerberg's evolution as a songwriter. Yes, these songs were written by the very same man who wrote ""Customer"", ""Bastards of Young"", and ""Alex Chilton.""The album is quiet and introspective and very good if listened to in the right perspective. Give it a try, but spread the listening out between doses of the classic Replacements albums"
4,Transition or Fade Away?,"Inconsitant and often frustrating, this album is hardly the way most pictured the mats going out. Yet it certainly has its moments of raw power, albiet quiet moments. ""Sadly Beautiful"" and ""Nobody"" are stunners and ""Merry Go Round"" bounces with that patented mats strut. ""Happy Town"" may be embaressingly silly but the albums closer more than makes up for it. Is ""The Last"" about the band, about Bob Stinson, as it was so eloquently put below, or is it just Paul trying not to give up? Anyway you look at it ""The Last"" is one of the most desperatly beautiful songs ever recorded. ""Would it hurt to fall in love a little slower? I know it hurts at any speed."" We miss you guys."
3,Sadly Beautiful,"The dissapointing bow-out from the greatest American band to never have a hit, ALL SHOOK DOWN has a few highlights.""When It Began,"" ""Attitude,"" and ""One Wink At A Time"" would all have gotten some airplay and some time on the charts in a normal world. I love the honking sax on ""One Wink At A Time,"" it's just a shame that 250 million Americans weren't allowed to hear it and love it too.But please, radio programmers, don't be offended by my criticism. I'm sure everyone loved hearing ""Whip It"" and ""Hey Rickie"" 50 million times instead."
2,It just doesn't click,"After reading a rather misleading four-star review of this album in Rolling Stone when this hummer came out, I rushed out to buy it. After all, you gotta start with a legendary band somewhere, right? Don't start here. After listening to this one, I couldn't figure out if I was missing something essential to rock 'n' roll or to the Replacements themselves. This is an incredibly inconsistent record. There are, admittedly, a few gems scattered here and there: the tear-jerking ""Sadly Beautiful,"" or the pleading ""The Last,"" which might be read as a plea to Bob Stinson to please quit drinking and ""make this last one really the last."" It's telling that these songs are ballads. Where's the hard rock? It ain't here. If the songs intend to rock, Westerberg holds back for some reason. Even the hardest song, ""My Little Problem,"" featuring a neat duet with Johnette Napolitano of Concrete Blonde, never gets as wild as it wants to. Agreed with a review below: For diehard Westerberg fans only."
2,this aint the mats,"sorry, i aint gonna agree with any rolling stone idle worship by saying that everything this legendary band was good. cause this isnt. two good songs tops. if you have to buy this, at least get let it be, sorry ma, tim, and pleased to meet me first. on second thought, buy something else."
4,Westerberg goes solo,"""All Shook Down"" has much more in common with Paul Westerberg's solo career than it does with the Replacements as a band. Gone are the snotty attitiude and the devil-may-care sloppiness that characterized the band at its height. Nevertheless, Westerberg is a fine pop craftsman, and this album features some of his best songs. In fact, there is scarcely a clunker on the whole album. I had the honor of seeing the 'Mats final live show in Chicago on the Fourth of July 1991 after this album was released. It was a bittersweet moment to say the least."
5,Paul Westerberg remains true to form,"Paul Westerberg's songs run the gamut of hard-rockers to soft,touching ballads that describe the human condition. He doesn'tsound really like anyone I have heard and credit his individuality in his song writing and the band's sound. He hastruly matured from his early punk music roots."
4,Had a premonition when this came out...,"Without looking at any reviews, I bought the 'Mats swan song album & found it to be a glittering jewel of pop tunes, as expected. I also noticed that it was not a Replacements album after a perusal of the liner notes. At that point, I expected it would only be a matter of time before the band broke up. A 'sadly beautiful' ending for a band that should have made it big."
2,Out of Date,"I got this as a present for my dad. It's cheap and easy, but out of date. It only goes to Windows 98. This was perfect for my dad seeing as he actually USES 98. *shrug*"
5,Incredible,Brought back memories of Laguna Beach. Great music from start to finish! Highly recomend it. Want to buy more of his sounds
3,"Good try, but..","Good try, but other than the energetic and supremely danceable ""Let's Go Back To My room, "" not much there."
4,Spare and Lovely Renderings of Christmas in the Desert,"The first track or two may seem a bit canned and mechanized, but the CD soon yields to the most gentle and beautiful guitar renderings of some favorite Christmas songs. The gentle melodies, the beautiful guitar themes, the Latin percussion and the Mexican horns soothe your soul and remind you of the beauty of the Southwest . . . you find yourself thinking about mountains, desert, firelight, travelers, caves and mangers. . ."
1,Background music for a bad restaurant,"I enjoy the music of Ottmar Liebert, but this cd is dreadful. The disc opens with a rendition of ""Deck the Halls"" that's slow enough for a classful of six-year-old violin students to keep up with. The over-emphasized downbeat in ""I Saw Three Ships"" ruins that song as well.The problem with Christmas music sometimes is that, since we've grown up hearing these tunes, we forget to appreciate how lovely some of the melodies really are. This disc does nothing to remind us. I can't imagine any less soulful or heartfelt versions of these songs. Skip this disc and get Joe Pass: Six-String Santa instead. Six-String Santa has got to be one of the best instrumental Christmas Collections of all time. Trust me."
1,Lifeless...unispired...flat...oh and I didn't like it,"...someone must have dragged him into the studioand forced him to run through the standardXmas ""stuff"". Pass on this one, get a Gene Autry instead."
1,Bleh!,"I've enjoyed other works by this artist, so I purchased ""Christmas and Sante Fe"" without listening to it first. What a mistake. It's what I call motivational music. It makes me want to do something else."
2,Ottmar does Musak,"I really like Ottmar Liebert and when he's in Seattle make a point of trying to make his concerts, at one point having sat through driving rain during an outdoor concert. Up until this point I have liked everyone of his disks. Maybe that's why this was such an incredible disappointment.This could be described as Ottmar does musak or Ottmar goes commercial. Its the ""same old, same old"", tired, Christmas music, but played on accoustic guitar. I expected more of Ottmar Leibert and will be more cautious hereafter."
4,The book to have if you work with fish,"If you ask anyone who deals with fisheries management, they recommend this book. It's thorough, readable even by those of us who don't have have advanced math degrees, and focuses on the practical consequences of guessing how many fish there really are in the sea. If you want to know what's behind the curtain when managers declare how many fish you can catch, this is the book to read."
4,Blast from the New Wave Past,"If you were into the New Wave of the 80's or want to be a part of the memory now, then sample this album. Like the great Canadians Platinum Blonde, this group's life was way to short. The fact that there are re-mixes proves the songs...Get in to the music with ""Save It"" and enjoy Images great sounds."
4,A concise historical account of LBJ's political chicanery.,"A well-written, thorough study of one of the forgotten, yet most important, moments in Texas and American politics. Kahl provides a complete story of ""Landslide Lyndon's"" ballot box fraud in his race for the U.S. Senate in 1948. Had Johnson lost this election, he might never have been president, and this book tells the complete story of how LB J and his cronies stole an election, then used parliamentary tricks to avoid being overturned. Mary Kahl puts the whole story together in a fascinating read. If you are a Lyndon Johnson fan, or a Lyndon Johnson critic, you have to read this story."
1,HORRIBLE PACKAGING BY MIKASA-ITEMS VERY DAMAGED,This is a really gorgeous set of candle holders .....if you get them intact though- the biggest challenge is to get them UNDAMAGED from the manufacturer. I had bought these from a place called Table & Home first and they came in damaged because there was absolutely no padding between the 3 candle holders. Upon contacting Table & Home they told me that they did have issues with this item and that all packages came in from Mikasa like that. Then I tried to buy this from Amazon (don't know if they go through an intermediate supplier) - and when these came in - the same horrible packaging - 3 glass candle holders with absolutely no padding/tissue paper etc in between them !!!!
1,Manufacturing DEFECTS,"Greetings,I recently purchased this set from a Bed, Bath and Beyond in the Chicagoland area. This design was simply stunning at first glance, however upon further inspection, not too hot to say the least.Two of the three pieces in the set had manufactured ""pin"" marks on the product itself. Sure they were tiny, but COMPLETELY noticeable. One pin mark might have been doable, however one piece in the set had about 5-7 pin marks in total, pretty much on every possible side.Definitely avoid this set unless you want to pay anywhere from $90-$120 on your hard earned cash on goods that are damaged before you even leave the store.Thank You!"
3,Honest if uneventful,"If you are farmiliar with the subjectmatter of the Buru, then you already know that the this book will not end with the author capturing the creature and solving the mystery. This book is an honest and interesting narrative of a 1940's trek into the jungle. It's very much a travelouge, sort of the day to day events that occur on such a trip. It is slightly dated, and like I said, they don't find the beast.Still, I give the author points for honesty, and it is an overall good natured account.Anyone who has a serious interest ion cryptozoology would like this book."
3,Late.,"I ordered this product on August 24. I did not receive it until Sept 7. On Sept 3, I ordered the real thing from another amazon seller. I received both filters on the same day. I was very unhappy with the shipping speed from this seller, though thrilled with the other."
5,The future possibly......soon,"My favorite eposode out of all the series,A classic look at the future of science,the acting is great so is the plot."
3,Solid barroom rocker,"Released in 1990, Zero Day was the debut full-length from American hard rockers Nevada Beach, something of an odd band out on a label like Metal Blade.Zero Day is a pretty decent offering of AC/DC and Nazareth-inspired hard rock songs. This is the kind of music you'd expect to hear playing at your rowdier local bar. Instead of going the glossy ""ballads and keyboards"" route that so many other bands took at the time, Nevada Beach stuck to their hard rockin' guns. Unfortunately that meant the band went largely unnoticed. Aside from an EP, this is their only release.It may not be very original, but Zero Day is a fun CD to spin when you want to hear some good, straightforward rock and roll. Fans of the more rawkin' ""hair metal"" era bands like Dirty Looks, Junkyard, Tangier and War Babies will definitely want to give it a listen."
3,Smells Nice...Ice Cubes helped more!,"Does smell nice, but I think putting the ice cubes down the disposal helped clear the clog more than the Plink."
3,cleaner,Product was fine however it was moved to a seperate order so I had to pay for shipping on this item and my other order processed at the same time... Buyer beware when emptying cart.
3,Somewhere between a 3 and a 5,"Well, I really like this product, and it probably is worth a ""5"" rating, but I decided to rate it as a ""3 to 5"", because the little round lemony things got away from their packaging and the dog ate a couple. So...I am waiting on its final disposition, you might say. If the dog survives intact, I'll give Plink a ""5-Star"" rating. Under more normal circumstances, I would be discussing Plink's great lemon scent, which actually does renew itself with a blast of hot water, as the label states. Probably not the ultimate doggie treat, however..."
2,Virg,"They Just make the diposal smell clean thats it, I was looking for something to clean it. Don't waste your money, Buy disposal Care does exactly what you pay for."
3,disposal cleaner,"It's a bit difficult to really tell how well this product is working. I do know that our disposal always smells clean and fresh, so I can only judge that it is working as advertised."
4,Good for a short amount of time,Works well and give a fresh scent after use. But that's short lived as the fragrance is gone after a few hours. But it works when first used and does get rid of the left over food smell. Just not a long-term solution.
1,"Deodorizer, not cleaner",It's basically a deodorizer; smells like lemon drops. It would have been just as effective to chop up a citrus fruit and throw it down the disposal. The product just masked the odors and didn't appear to do any cleaning. The glowing reviews here seem kind of dodgy as they read like they were written by people from a marketing firm rather than actual consumers.
4,"Easyb to use, fresh, and effective","I'm a big fan of these little lemon marbles. They are easy to use and fresh-smelling. It's hard to say whether they actually clean the disposal - they don't foam up the sink as other disposal products do - but they seem to legitimately freshen and deodorize, not just mask the scent. For my home, they've been extremely useful. A bonus is that after you use one, for the next few times you run hot water or turn on the disposal, the lemon scent is renewed."
1,Disappointing & very lack luster,"If you are interested in this because there is a violin in the band and you think this will make for an interesting mix of instrumentation, don't buy this album. Any traces of the violin are lost in the mix of screechy electric guitars, so it sounds like any old guitar, bass, keyboard/synth combo. This CD just didn't do a thing for me. I thought it was over-produced and boring. One more for the garage sale bin."
5,Great Voice / Great album,This album is beatiful. Emeline Michel has a great voice and she is a great singer.I recommend this album to anyone who is interested in international music.
3,It is ok,"It comes quick, but the picture obviously looks better than the real product, so I have a little bit of dissappointment. Hope it can run a little long life."
5,Works good.,"No issues, works much better than our foot pump that is product replaced. Pumps a bike tire up quite fast."
2,What happend to Dewalt quality?,"I remember when Dewalt made quality tools, cheaper brands make better quality shafts. The bit holder magnet is the weak link that makes this tool useless to someone that uses it full time. If you plan on occasionally using the shaft then it may be worth it. Avoid if you are a carpenter you will be pulling your tip out of every screw. I bought 5 of these and they all work the same."
5,so refreshing,Speck and enoch provide the perfect beat backdrop to the amazing lyrical skills of cise and akin. An amazing album! The first three tracks will blow your mind and it doesn't stop there. A great combination of political and emotional awareness.
1,Wrong Cable!,"Like several others, I received the wrong cable from Westronics. Black and ""Indoor Only"". Amazon gave me a full refund - I would strongly suggest not buying this item."
1,Also got WRONG CORD!!,Like the last reviewer I also got the wrong cord. It's black and not even made by GE. I ordered the 25ft one. Called amazon they are investigating it. Looks like the company they are getting these cords from is supplying amazon.com with the wrong cord. But amazon should make sure they are getting correct products from suppliers!
3,A question of trust.,"I am really going up and down about this series. I found the first book lukewarm, while reading the second book interested me enough to run out immediately and buy the third. However, now that I have read the third I have to confess to feeling a little bit let down.The two main characters, Llian and Karan, spend most of the book stressing out about whether they trust each other. Somehow, this point is more important than the lives of their friends or the fate of the world. I have to say that I still find Karan one of the more remarkably unlikeable female leads in recent fantasy. I sincerely hope that in the 4th book, they get a therapist offline and the rest of the book can continue without further whining.That said, the adventure *does* continue and other of the characters become more interesting. I like very much the direction Rulke is taking and I am curious to hear more about him.Not a terrible read, just not a great one."
4,Glider,"This EP was my first foray into MBV and probably why i love this release so much. I can't stand to see it sitting on the used shelf so i have bought the record and tapes, giving them away to friends. Starting off with the album version of ""Soon"" you wonder why this wasn't just called the Soon EP. Very representative of everything on Loveless, i can't complain. Then we get to the sound of an industrial plastics factory with ""Glider"". Beautifully disturbing. Kevin Shields takes a shot at the mic in one of his better songs ""Don't Ask Why"". The closer ""Off Your Face"" has a sort of New Order feel to it and was the reason i bought the album. I like this companion to Loveless and also recommend the Tremolo EP."
3,Not worth $9.98. Not even close.,"The EP GLIDER is highly overrated. Not only does it only have four songs and clocks in at under twenty minutes, one of those songs is a seven-minute track taken directly from the album LOVELESS. So, if you already own LOVELESS, you'll only be getting about 13 minutes of new material from this EP. Unless you're a diehard fan of My Bloody Valentine, or a huge fan of the song ""Soon,"" then you better stay far, far away from this EP (unless you find it for dirt cheap at a second-hand store; in that case, pick it up immediately). Buy ISN'T ANYTHING (see my review) or LOVELESS instead. They're both wonderful albums."
3,Rusk Shining Sheen...strong men's cologne aroma,"I ordered this based on the positive reviews I found, however, I don't recall a review mentioning the aroma. Eeeeeww...this has a really strong ""men's cologne"" aroma! Great for men...problem is...I bought this for me!! It does create shine, but be careful, a small amount goes a long way. I would recommend spraying it into your hands first and rub them together and then lightly coat your hair rather than spraying it directly on or you'll end up with greasy looking hair.I would like to mention that I purchased this from Dealseekers.com (aka...salonsavings.com) and mistakenly deleted my feedback there and can't leave new feedback so I'd like to leave it for this seller here..""I Received the Rusk Shining Sheen within 3 days via USPS despite winter storms in seller's area, as well as my own. Impressive! Good seller!! Thx!"
1,Out of date!,"Many guide books don't need to be updated frequently - Italy perhaps. But China has gone through so much change in the past 10 years, that this book is now completely useless. Cities that used to be a dump are now eager for tourism. Outlying smaller towns are now within reach. Hotel options have gone from a choice of one or two to dozens. This one might even discourage you from going to a place that could be an adventure of a lifetime. This is not a book for anyone wanting to visit the China of today, take the time and money and purchase the updated version."
3,Misses a lot but overall useful for travel in CHina,"China is a difficult country to travel in, a fact which the new Lonely Planet China guide makes quite clear. Modern China is rarely exotic and at times quite frustrating for tourists, and the book does not mince words on this subject. However, if you are planning on undertaking some hard independent travel in the PRC, LP is up to the task and contains a lot of very practical information about budget lodging and transportation. LPs main shortcoming, as I see it, is that it concentrates too much on the cities and sites ""worth seeing"" and not enough on some of the beautiful counytside."
1,"Full of inaccuracies, sloppy, not worth buying","I have always had a very good impression with Lonely Planet travel guidebooks. However, this guide really changes my mind. It is the worst LP guide book that I have ever read. It is full of inaccuracies and is sloppily-written. There are just too many mistakes littering around the book. Those sections of the book that deal with the Chinese history are particularly poorly-written, showing the authors' severe lack of research in the subject. Throughout the book, the authors also show a total lack of respect and understanding for the local population and culture. The 1-star rating I give is due to the large quantity of maps available in the book."
5,Powermatic cabinet saw - 5hp,"Oh man..., what a saw! So smooth, stable and powerful! I ripped about 40bf of 10/4 maple this morning on this thing, no problem! This thing is noticeably smoother than even the old standby unisaw. Nice..."
1,Unsafe power switch on Powermatic Model 66,WARNING!!!! The switch on this unit can be turned on by pressing against it with a nail belt or a pair of Carhart Carpenter Overalls. I saw this happen to a 40 year Master Craftsmen. The older machines had a much safer switch. Be sure to unplug the unit when changing any saw blade. The saw itself is an excellent table saw and is the top of the line for heavy duty table saws. POWERMATIC NEEDS TO INSTALL A SAFER ON & OFF SWITCH Jim
5,Delightful Dawn,"This is one of my favorite CDs, a REAL GEM. There isn't a dud amongst these treasures. Quite tradational, something country has given up on, to my great dismay. Rockin house, is just one of several tunes that were and still are just a little to good for today's country. Vince Gill knew a great voice, she has backed him up at many of his shows, and he always showcases her. With good reason!"
3,Not for Me,"This tape is probably best used by someone who is young and fit, not someone overweight or out of shape, and certainly not an almost senior citizen like myself. There are actually four workouts on this tape. In the first the participants use chairs, broomsticks,or no props to perform a group of exercises that include toe touches, sit ups, and many others that seem rather old fashioned. The second is an introduction to weights with a few upper body exercises and only ten reps of each. Then comes a lightning fast combo of the first two workouts. I thought strength training was best performed at a slow controlled pace, but this was very fast--50 reps of each exercise.Finally he does a buddy set of the same exercises used in the first three for people who don't like to exercise alone.Jake is personable and fun. I really liked the video of the theme song at the end which included all of the participants."
3,"Fairly good self-study book, but lots of typos","I bought this book as a self-study guide for mathemetical logic. It contains a thorough treatment of propositional and predicate calculus, and briefly covers related subjects such as set theory and Goedel's incompleteness theorem. Overall it is fairly good, presenting the topic in a clear concise manner. The low (for a math textbook at least) price and the fact that it contains answers to selected exercises make this a decent choice for a self-study guide. The only problem I had was the fact that this book contains many typographical errors (I have the 1988 revised edition), which can be somewhat confusing in the the early sections of the book and extremely confusing in later chapters, which are difficult enough."
3,A fair starter kit,"This is a fairly useful work for beginners in mathematical logic. However, one gets the idea that Hamilton himself is a bit muddled, as that's how it comes across in places. I wonder whether there is a text on mathematical logic that isn't a bit muddled now I come to think of it."
5,Genious,"These are the most incredible lyrics. the music is the best combination of rock hiphop i have heard.dannys voice is powerful and brooks rap and words are will addict you.my favorites Storm chaser, My addiction and It dont matter.Ifyou want to hear whats going on in 2001 check it out"
5,Where have these guys been????,"Of course the obvious answer, based on the subject matter of this CD, is in drug rehab! They obviously put their time to good use because this is my greatest musical discovery for the year. Lyrics deal primarily with the seedy under-belly of their chemically dependent life and the struggles to stay sober all the while put to beautifully performed and produced music. This CD will not disappoint."
5,CUZWECAN,Rehab is the most addictive group I have ever abused. Buy this cd now! Than get on KAZAA and download the CUZWECAN album and while your at it download Brooks Bufords cd cause I dont think its ever going to see the light of day. tracklisting at ICAMETOTROUBLEYOU.COM
5,memories,this is a good cd brings back great drinking memories. there is about 5 songs on this album that i liked.
4,Rehab Rocks,"This is earlier Rehab. A bit raw but a great piece. Showing some influence from other bands, moreso than their later music. This cd sounds like it came out of Detroit not Georgia but that is not a bad thing either. I love Rehab and think it is a awesome addition to my collection."
5,Best Rehab album,This is definitely the best Rehab album out there. I like Rehab's unique sound and this is the album that I always go back to when I'm in the mood for some Rehab.
2,Did you ever think they'd last long? Well me neither!,"First off let's get this straight. These guys are NOT Crazy Town. I mean at least Crazy Town had a catchy tune. But if there was one song on the whole album that I could care less about, it would have to be Crazy People. This is the most ignorant song on the entire album: ""Sittin' on the corner of 33rd and utter hell. You ain't killed nobody today, but I ain't well"" That is pretty much the extent of their talent. Not all hope is lost though. The one hit that they DID have on the radio, It Dont Matter, is OK yet it's still too poppy for my tastes. Other recommended tracks, Sittin' at a Bar and Storm Chaser. 2 stars for effort."
5,sitting at a bar,"Ok. I had no effin idea who these people were until I started dating my last boyfriend. It was totally wierd to hear that a guy related so well to so many of the songs on that cd....(drinkin problem, sitting at a bar, my addiction). After having to listen to it several times, it got stuck in my head. I am jammin out to this cd everywhere I go!! I can DEF say that sitting at a bar is my new theme song!!! I rate it a 5!!"
1,Where is your dignity?,"How can anyone live with themselves charging $100 for something that doesn't even work. I could live with less than stellar sound quality, but peeling paint and valves that just don't come back up all the time?? This was a big huge waste of money. I expect garbage when shopping at the dollar store, but when I pay $100 for something, I would expect it to work. Spend the money and buy something else."
2,This Book Stank,"This book was too long and too boring for me to say any good words on it. I did not like the cut-and-dry style of Harper Lee, and i didn't appreciate the way that the first half of the book seems useless after you have completed part 2. all the author had to do was introduce the character of Boo Radley in a paragraph or two and then get on with the trial. i know that some people would argue that part 1 had more substance than simply telling the reader about boo, but i dont think much else mattered, so hate me all you want to. this is just a typical book that they make you read in school : dull. so i didnt expect much else."
3,Cops in Hats,"The second Don Siegel movie from 1968 about a cop in NYC hunting the killer who stole his gun. (Paging Dr. Freud.) Great NYC location work is mixed with some dreay backlot stuff in this otherwise good policer. We get a little too much of the cops' homelives, but there's a hard-hitting climax. (Plus the last line in the picture provides ironic resonance to the city's racial issues with law enforcement that haven't gone away since the picture's release. ) Nice brassy Don Costa score."
3,a cop dies because he didn't wear his vest,This film is a different era: even New York is cleanerappearing here. The dirty cop is OK becausehe is doing it to save his son.The police commissioner is human because he is having an affair.The detective sleeps at his girl friend's after a fight with his wife.His wife gets drunk and almost sleeps with the single detectiveher husband got for her date.The blood and guts is not quite as bloody or gutsy?
4,Misleading Title,"While reading this book I kept expecting and hoping for practical information on solutions for spaces in my current home. I checked this book out of the library based solely on the title. It was a very interesting book. Many of the solutions would mean reconstruction or a considerable outlay of money. If you are in the process of building or remodeling, this is a very informative book that provides practical and efficient ideas for using and designing your space and I give it a 5-star rating.If you are looking for lots of design ideas for problem areas, you may find a few relevant tips, but not enough to warrant purchasing of this book, so I would give it a 3-star rating.I am giving this book a 4 star because it really does not cover ""Not so Big Solutions for your Home"". It should have been called Solutions and Practical Ideas for Constructing your Home. That title would have earned a 5 star."
3,NOT SO FAST THERE,"The premise is that the pictures shown are examples of what can be achieved by merely understanding certain underlying principles; the fact is they're simply examples of what can be achieved by hiring professional designers and spending lots of money.The ""rules"" that emerge are just current practice. The so-called good design of today, such as open kitchens, would have been a bad design a hundred years ago, when people were plucking chickens there, and will be eventually made obselete when rooftop helipads become common :-)But these Not so Big books seem to have been successful, and much of the credit has to go to the excellent book design and the author's cheerful prose."
5,Great Home Ideas,We are about to start building a new house. There were solutions brought out in this book that supported what we were already planning. The book also had some good suggestions that we will use to renovate our current house to get it ready for resale.This is an excellent book!
1,Oh No! It's Rosie O'Donnel!,"As we have all seen, Rosie is a bad mother. Her youngest child recently broke his leg due to neglect from Rosie being off in the other room counting her money. As we have also seen, and unfortunatly heard, she is an incredibly sub-par singer. If she has a thought on something she will not talk about it like the normal people in this world, she will ""write"" a song about it and have it go with the same music of one of her many favorite Broadway shows. This CD demonstrates how lazy Rosie is. There are only about half of these tracks that have Rosie on them, not that i am complaining. She also only selects the artists that we all have heard a thousand or more times on the local radio. Why be so superficial? why don't you work with some musical acts that are not as mainstream, and come up with some songs that are actually innovative, not just the same kind of music that we can all hear on the Top 40 countdown."
5,not quite as good,"This one just isn't as good.I like it and it's better than most holiday cd's but I was very impressed with last years and this one doesn't quite match it.Macy Gray, Dixie Chicks, and surprizingly Ricky Martin are the real gems on this one.I say buy it but be warned that you may find yourself reaching for the skip button once or twice.Happy Holidays!"
1,YIKES,"I am not one to do this type of thing, however I just heard this over the weekend and it was [pretty bad]. Let me start by saying I never understood the Rosie thing. I can't fathom how she has legions of followers, but this is America and miracles happen every day. Tastes are subjective, but one thing not subjective is that Rosie can not sing. On a handful of these songs, she is heard moaning in the background like some kind of animal in heat. The end result is that otherwise fine performances end up sounding like high school garage band stuff. Imagine the ego of someone to expect that people would pay to hear this? Maybe she is smarter than I give her credit for and a disciple of PT Barnum..."
1,Rosie O'Donnell is just as annoying as Kathie Lee Gifford,I know for a fact that Rosie O'Donnell has admitted to the public that she cannot sing. Now if she can't sing then why has she released two Christmas albums with her annoying caterwauling? Oh my god is she awful. All the pro tools in the world can't make Rosie O'Donnell sound even mediocre on cd.
1,Wretched Refuse!,"Rosie O'Donnell recorded the tracks for this CD with other artists at the height of her TV popularity, and the proceeds from the sales went to charity. Kudos on that count, however, as for the quality of selections and performances, skip it. With the exception of a couple of lovely solos from Jewel and Linda Eder, the rest is a waste. Rosie, not much of a singer,joins many performers for bad duets that almost make the listener wish that Christmas would come and go sooner. While the CD banked on the popularity in 2000 of Jessica Simpson, Macy Gray, Smash Mouth, Destiny's Child (Beyonce' still active with her sisters) and other artists, as Christmas selections, the music is painful.For Christmas musc performed by contmporary performers get A Very Special Christmas, and in particular 1 and 2. Skip Rosies mish mash mess."
1,NEVER ORDERED,"LOOKED AT BUT NEVER DID PLACE AN ORDER FOR, THAT I CAN REMEMBER????? LONG GONE 5 MORE WORD WORD WORD WORD WORD"
1,Never used it. Requires Internet activation,"Am finally catching up on my reviews. I'm surprised you can still buy this. Aren't they up toSystem Suite 9 Professional? I got this for free after rebate. 3 user license.Unfortunately, this version required you ""activate"" it via the Internet. (It said that in the fine print on the box.) I can understand their reason, but 1) I have some computers not on the net, 2) I have most of my computers ""locked down"" so they don't leak much out to the net and 3) I don't trust applications that phone home.So I never used the product. I have other, separate, mostly freeware utilities that do the same thing. I'd be upset if I paid something for it."
4,good utility suite,"Cleans the computer well. All-in-one feature performs many tasks in one step, so no user interface is necessary. I use a separate program for anti-virus, so I can't comment on that portion. Good value."
1,Not very impressed,"After purchasing the program thinking it would perform a through check on my Presario running XP Home all I get is a message that SSP6 has unexpectedly quite. I emailed tech support w/ the info, but so far no response after 10 days. There is no # to call for support. Maybe I overlooked something.Also, I submitted the rebate form which came on the package, but was told that the seller was not participating in the rebate program and I need to check w/ them. I did and they said they shipped what VCOM had provided them, which included a rebate form if doing a competitive upgrade.Not very impressed w/ either the software or the company. Would never buy another product from these guys, even when the price after rebate is 0. LOF."
1,BE ADVISED:This is Single User Software,"Be advised, this Software is for a SINGLE USER, only licensed for one computer. I bought this for Home use after using SS% for 2 years and V-Com said it would no longer be supported of 03/06. I installed it on 2 home computers, it worked fine for 4 weeks, then it popped up a Box on my second computer that I couls not use it because it was licensed on another computer, I needed to buy additional license for each computer. When I tried to use it on my Main computer, it popped up the same message. So now it will not work on either computer. I uninstalled it and sent it back. Just because it's Cheap does not mean it's any good."
4,Won't mess up your system,"Unlike Norton, I have not had issues with Win98, 2000, XP-Pro, nor have I had to periodically reload the OS on the ten assorted machines I have used this Suite on, for many years.I would prefer less keystrokes to perform routine tasks, but will trade that for the lack of headaches and the very good OS optimizing/maintenance. I use homebuilt desktops, Sony, Compaq, Averatec and IBM laptops; all w/o problems; all run swiftly as the registry files are much smaller and my HDs are optimized.My other gripe is the loss of multi-machine okay to run it, as with the older versions. There was no warning that my new version would restrict me to one computer, which happened to be an Averatec that died. E-mail contact reset the license to my IBM laptop. I run the software I paid retail prices for in an un-updated mode (except for anti-virus and anti-spyware) on the others.I'd like to see an inexpensive multi-machine option offered."
1,Fatally Flawed,"After owning SS5, I was looking forward to 6 as a replacement for my attempt to use the very slow running McAfee security products. This version of SS simply failed to loaded it auto email and filescan functions, despite numerous suggestions from VCOM. I was forced to return it as defective and had to the pay the shipping myself. I was very disappointed in this product and will not buy another of their products again."
4,History makes history,"This is like the history text books we had in the 1950's, which it may have been.Pure unadorned text. No concessions to short attention spans here.I read it on my Ipad however and was able to switch to Wikipedia for analysis, pictures and maps as the mood took me. Wonderful stuff.I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and can heartily recommend it.You don't have to take my word for it either. Google the author's name and read a review written when it was first published, 1938.History makes history.Also it's free!"
2,"Format, format , format","The format of this book as downloaded made it almost impossible to read. The original was of a very dated style with marginal notes that proved impossible to accomodate in the ebook format. You should remove it, I found it close to unreadable, certainly totally annoying in navigating the main text."
5,Very good overview,"I have read quite a few books on the monarchs and various aspects of Tudor England and I found this text to be most helpful because it gave a balanced view of the issues that came up. More modern books, while using the latest research, put forward a particular interpretation, which is quite valid, but Innes's book would be a good introduction to the era."
5,Ellis and Monroe,"What a great read! A dark mystery revealed through a good plot and lots of great lines, some even made me laugh. I couldn't put it down till done!"
2,Almost a Good film,"""Ivory""on paper would have looked like Academy Award material. The reality is very different, the film is a hodge podge full of fine performances and good intentions. Central to the success of the film is Tim Draxl's superb performance as the young concert pianist attempting to navigate the world around him. The problem is, there is a lack of conflict in the film and we end up with a performance that is not supported by a driven and interesting story."
5,Leonard at his best,"This is a hard, fast-paced, joyride of a book. Leonard doesn't write many bad books, but occasionally he seems to run out of ideas. Not this time, though. If you're looking for the perfect busride/planeride/trainride reading, something to keep you absorbed for hours, pick this baby up.JK"
5,Another great Leonard novel,"Elmore Leonard wrote this book in the early '80s just when he was hitting is stride with contemporary crime novels. STICK has all the trademark elements of an EL yarn--a down-to-earth hero surrounded by a bag of mixed nuts, colorful but lethal bad guys, beautiful women with issues, lean prose, and lines of dialogue so good you sometimes have to stop and read them twice. If you like his later books, you should go back and read the earlier ones. They're so much fun they should be illegal, and STICK is no exception."
4,Everyone after a buck,"Things haven't changed much as everyone is still trying to score. If you aren't one of the predators, you may be eaten. If you are one of the predators, you may still be eaten. There are con men, drug dealers, and people with money looking for investments. People can sell drugs, they can sell information, or they may sometimes sell their bodies. Earnest ""Stick"" Stickley has just served 7 years in a Michigan prison for an armed robbery that went bad. He used to sell used cars, although they were usually not his cars. You will get a little insight into surviving on the inside. Now he is out, and has returned to Miami to visit his daughter. An invitation to ride along on a simple assignment seems routine until things go very, very bad. But Stick finds opportunities in adversity, scoring money, and scoring with various women. It's one of those stories where various people get to the top and then get dragged down as people feed on each other."
5,A classic,"This is a book Mae West tried to have stopped because she wanted a cut of the money. It went through THREE different editions! FILLED with photos and every saying she ever said, it is highly recommended."
2,Mirror electrical not working,When I first installed the mirror only operated up and downwards. Later it stopped operating at all. You have the option to manipulate the mirror by hand and it does work. I am not sure if the malfunctioning is related to the wires coming out of my truck or is the mirror itself. I will have it checked soon. Price on this item was unbeatable as I checked many other sources and I decided to go for this one.
4,Teaches very relevent words for use in society today.,"This book usually is intended for students who have already studied a year of chinese. However it is a bit more advanced than that, but should not pose too much of a problem. The vocabulary and text are much more interesting than texts from first year Chinese courses, and the material is much more relevent to the educated populace of China and Taiwan."
5,Great Introduction to Taiwan,"I used this book when studying in Taiwan. It is definately intermediate-level and may be too advanced for beginners. It follows American language teaching methods and has explanatory grammer sentence patterns, lots of drills, and fun practise exercises. It also has a good amount of reading material included. The English explanations are clear and Mainland-style pinyin is used with traditional characters. It is definately *the* book to learn about Taiwan and its everyday life. If you have never been to Taiwan, some of the subjects might seem confusing or odd, but it all makes sense once you are there."
3,Needs 10-pin USB jumper on motherboard or on a USB 2.0 card,"I wish the product said that it required a 10-pin USB 2.0 jumper on the motherboard to connect the cable. (It uses 9 of the ten pins on the ten-pin jumper.) I was hoping to fasten it onto my USB 2.0 PCI card, but no go.I'm upgrading to a new motherboard soon, so I'm not returning it."
3,it's ok,works ok. nothing to write home about. however the 2 face plates was the reason i bought it.
4,Very nasty woman - very clever writer !,We follow a young lawyer as he becomes more and more drawn into a deadly search for truth. His recently-deceased father's honor and his own very young flirtation bring him into a 'campaign of terror' devised by a truly evil serial killer.
2,Good compromise,"If you have a pre-wireed circuit, this switch can allow you to vary the speed of your fan from the wall switch. Easy to find in day or night. It will not give you as many speeds as the digital switches."
4,I liked it.,"This is a fun game at first, but you might come across some problems. You treat real animals, and use real tools. This is a fun game!"
2,TRUCULENT WRITING STYLE,"Almost all good intentions Mr. Ferrill had when writing this book were wasted due to his bad writing skills. The book is rough, truculent, some topics that would be easy to follow are boring because the writing is so bad. Anyway, the Roman Empire is decently focused in this book, as well as the explanations for its fall."
3,Somewhat enlighting.,"I enjoyed reading Ferrill's work. It was generally well written and easy to understand for a non scholar. Some areas were glossed over; why the Eastern Empire survived in spite of the Eastern army suffering two major defeats-Adrianople and Julian's abortive Persian campaign. I liked his thesis that barbarian armies were not composed of mostly cavalry which is a common misconception. Ferrill does defend the Western emperor Honorius in spite of history's judgement that he was a do nothing emperor and basically ensured the destruction of the west. He does not explain certain key events: namely why the Goths after victory at Adrianople became federoti under Theodosius only to rebel a generation later, culminating with the sack of Rome.Overall, this work is worth reading for its simple style and essentially correct assessment of the Western Empire's demise."
3,Worth A Look; An Occasionally Inspired History,"The Fall of The Roman Empire, Arther Ferrill; Thames & Hudson (1986)Ferrill's occasional bad writing habits & inept editing almost ruined The Fall. How often in 169 pages did I see the word, ""however""? Easily, one hundred. And the bogus ironies! See Pat O'Conner's definition of irony in ""Woe Is I"" (1996), & see if Ferrill's ""ironies"" conform to the definition (doubtful).At any rate (another otiose crutch-phrase found often in mediocre histories), Fall's not worth a full review. But it is worth holding on to - due to the sustained moments when Ferrill wrote enthusiastically & well, which is the point of writing, to begin with."
1,Very disapointing...,"I bought this album to help my music students and I listened to it and have never used it. Charlotte is still very young and I think she should leave fame until she's older. her voice has a lot to progress on and I've noticed she does go out of tune. I am not jealous of her as I have no need for fame. Also she does need much more practice to become a singer of 2000/01. The album is a waste of money, I have listened to the others as well and they are no better. Voice of an angel is an overstatement. She has a lot more work to do before becoming a wonderful singer though she had got a good chance of becoming near enough perfect.."
5,My favorite Christmas cd.,This is my favorite Christmas cd. O Holly Night makes it worth buying. The DVD is also great. I saw her in person with the Atlanta Symphony. She is the real deal! You may want to listen to this cd all year long.
4,A musical piece for the ages!,"Charlotte Church...Two years ago the little girl impacted us with ""Voice of an Angel"", now a teenager she is still amazing us with Classical Christmas songs on ""Dream a dream"", a record families will enjoy year after year... and in a future the little kids of today will remember Christmas and Charlotte Church, even if they are not Classical Music lovers...But who knows?.. They can learn to apreciate real music."
2,Just So Disappointing,"As a listener following Ms. Church's marvelously developing voice, I was disapponted in her new Christmas CD, ""Dream A Dream."" Her voice has a shillness to it in many of the songs. I am not sure if the songs were cast wrong for her voice or simply had the wrong range. More enjoyable to listen to was her rendition of ""When a Child Is Born"" - as well as ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen."""
4,The Singer for Those Who Love Beautiful Rising Talents,"Those who say that Church has a bad voice or that people who like Church don't understand singing do not themselves have any patience for young rising talents. I have not heard from her ""mummy or press agent"" yet I find Charlotte Church to have a very beautiful voice that shall only become better with age and experience. If the point is not Church's voice, but how she dresses, then why bother to listen to her? I am a mother with two grown daughters who does not care how a performer is dressed on the album cover but who finds Charlotte Church's voice and singing presently overflowing with soul-stirring passion and with the promise of greatness. This from an up-and-coming Charlotte Junkie."
2,Disappointing - don't get it it,"I was terribly disappointed in the overall quality of this album, even though I already had only middling expectations. Charlotte Church is overrated as a singer, and unfortunately the production of these songs does her even less justice than she deserves. I felt orchestra and choir overpowered her voice on most selections. Buy something else for Christmas."
3,Some good - Some bad,"I enjoyed about half this CD. Some of the carols lend themselves to her style of singing, some do not - and really are more appropriate for ""pop"" or ""easy listening"" voices."
3,Shipping was fast but CD Skips alot.,It is a nice CD but two of the tracts skip really bad. Quite disappointed because one of them is my favorite song. This is most likely going to be my last time buying a used CD. I don't know what I was thinking.
1,"Too young, too flat","I downloaded ""O Holy Night"" because of the singer's name. The little sampler didn't include the opening screech-fest, the fight between instrumentals and singer, nor the singer's flat notes working toward the heights. Definitely not one of the better renditions! I would not recommend."
5,It Simply Moved Me,"Wow! ... When I first heard [Charlotte's] version of O Holy Night (my all time favorite Christmas song) it moved me to tears. I personally find her voice mesmerizing. Ave Maria is simply haunting. Mary's Boy Child, a song that is rarely performed, is done here with grace and quality. She sings from the depth of her soul and her voice is indeed a rare gift. Like all people she will grow, and improve. But that doesn't necessarily mean that her starting point (where she is at now) is a place of vocal or talent deficiency. I will be listening to this music again in the future, and looking forward to more of her recordings. She truly is an artist."
5,Wonderful!,"I had never really been into this style of music, but I ended up hearing ""Just Wave Hello"" (from Charlotte's self titled cd) on a Ford commercial, and I knew I was immediately hooked. I really liked that album, but this one is even better. This CD includes of my favorite Christmas music with great vocals and music. The song ""Dream a Dream"" is wonderful. I highly recommend broadening your musical horizons and giving this a shot!"
3,Overdone,"I have found myself listening to the title track over and over again, entranced by the music and the children's beautiful voices. However, most of the rest of the CD sounded overworked by Charlotte Church. She pushes her voice, instead of letting it flow. In ""Dream a Dream"", the duet with Billy Gilman, their voices float and dance with the music. I wish this cut were on Billy's album instead. He is so natural and pure. It's too bad Ms. Church drowns him out."
5,Now This Is Beautiful!,This is the way Christmas songs should be sung! All the songs are so beautiful I don't even have a favorite. All I can say is BUY IT!
4,Just Relax,"...if you just listen for the pleasure of it, you'll really love this effort. There is no better place to start than ""O Holy Night."" I recently heard it while driving in Florida and immediately knew I had to have the CD. The CD, overall, is powerful, beautiful stuff, despite what technical imperfections [some people] may wish to dwell on."
4,Wonderful cd,"I liked ""Dream a Dream"" but Billy Gilman was not that good. I liked ""Ave Maria"", ""O Holy Night"", and ""Silent Night"". Those are my favourite songs. ""Winter Wonderland"" does not sound right for her. I think ""The Christmas Song"" is average. All traditional songs sound excellent. This is one of my favourite cd's."
2,Disappointing,"Most of the songs on this album are either badly over-orchestrated, badly over-produced, or both. Whoever put this album together should have just let Charlotte sing, without all the excess background. As far as the title song, it's only value is in its ""cute"" factor of two precocious children singing together. Spare me, please."
2,"She has a good voice, but she sings with no feeling.","I listened to both of her CD's, and my opinion is the same for both: they're cold. She's missing the one thing that could make the CD even a LITTLE better:feeling. When I listened to this Christmas CD, it was like this. See, she hit the notes perfectly, but she had no feeling behind it. I would suggest you buy another CD, one with more feeling to it. Her cold feelingless voice leaves you blank. I would suggest getting a CD of someone with more feeling in what they are singing."
2,Pushed too far - painful to listen to,"An adequate compilation of Xmas songs from an OK, developing soprano. Most church cantors could have done as well. Would be acceptable as background music, but as with her other albums lacking in real musical worth. Ms. Church is being pushed too hard too fast and I found the strained attempts at ""serious"" vocalizing painful to listen to - scary really. One fears another child star being overexposed and exploited, in danger of ruining her voice. Offensive in the extreme was the listing of ""Dream a Dream"" as anonymous - the blatant note-for-note ripoff of Faure's Pavane offends musical sensibility. I'm not a trained soprano - simply a listener not sucked into the hype."
1,Great potential but not ready!,"I am NOT a jealous trained soprano; I simply can tell good classical singing from bad, and wish that those who love this young voice would take the trouble to hear a truly great soprano. Ms. Church may someday be great, but not yet; also she is pushing and overdoing, and as a result sounds nearly unbearable at times. She should be sent back to the conservatory and the local parish choir for a few years, and protected from further exploitation by promoters; she is risking her voice and the nerves of lovers of great music."
1,What????,"I don't like Charlotte Church's recordings at all. She needs to understand she cannot sing opera right now, and she is but she is singing it the wrong way. I read on her biography she made it because she was singing kareoke just when she sings kareoke doesn't mean she has to be an opera singer right away. She needs to take voice lessons to improve her vibrato and her tone and needs to sing IN TUNE. She needs to be trained for a very long time and she obviously does not have musical backround and therefore people overestimate her. I am glad that i did not buy this CD."
1,Charlotte Church's 3rd worst CD ever,Charlotte's CD this time is very bad as usual. I can sing much better than her cause my voice teacher cares about me and Charlotte's voice teacher does not!
2,"Nice, but unfortunately not much more","Charlotte Church`s voice is certainly beautiful but it definitely lacks character. She performs well, but I miss a touch of personality in all of her songs. The Christmas songs are all the well known once it`s just too bad that they seem so shallow. Maybe Charlotte Church will learn with age to interpret songs rather than just singing them"". At this point she doesn`t come near the mature voice as someone like Barbra Streisand, but time will tell how Charlotte Church's voice develops. Meanwhile I wait a few years before purchasing another CD from her."
5,The Angel's voice is still Angelic,"The Angel's voice is still Angelic:(yes, I said this twice) Dream a Dream is a wonderful CD. The first track ""Dream a Dream"" just screams for a video and is very heartfelt, much like ""Pie Jesu"" and ""Just Wave Hello"" on Charlotte's first two albums. Forget for a moment that this is a Christmas album and listen to it now until Christmas and again throughout the new year."
3,"""Hark the Herald ... "" is a keeper.","Charlotte Church's album, ""Dream a Dream"" is a Christmas album. Charlotte has a high soprano voice and the songs in this album sound like the kind of music you would hear in a fancy church service. In fact, I think that's what they mean when they say ""High Church."" This album isn't for everyone, but ""Hark! the Herald Angels Sing"" is definitely one song that is worth listening to. The song starts out with Charlotte singing with the orchestra. Then the next verse is the choir singing with the orchestra. And in the final verse, they all come together with Charlotte's voice rising above the others, like a seagull soaring above a landfill. This song also reminds me of the way Jeannette MacDonald sang ""Battle Hymn of the Republic/San Francisco"" at the end of the 1936 movie, ""San Francisco."" So, although I think ""Hark! the Herald Angels Sing"" is 5 big stars, I gave the overall album 3 stars because I liked her first two albums better."
3,Not as bad (or as good) as some would have you believe,"Like many others, I was introduced to Charlotte Church a couple years ago, during the ""Voice Of An Angel"" hype. ""Dream A Dream"" is better than VOAA, simply because Charlotte's voice has matured greatly. The title track in particular is extremely well done (and Billy Gilman, who previously had annoyed me to no end, also turns in a credible performance). However, even to an opera novice like me, it's obvious Charlotte has a long way to go to reach the status of a Renee Fleming or Frederica von Stade, the latter whom Charlotte's voice superficially resembles. The comparisons to Sarah Brightman, however, are not far fetched. Opera purists rant about how her singing is a textbook case on how not to sing; her fans rhapsodize about her magical voice. To someone who doesn't fall into either camp, it's a decent album made by a 14-year-old who sings pretty well--emphasis on 14-year-old."
2,Not so great,I wish I had read all of these other reviews before I bought this CD. Her voice is actually quite irritating on this CD and the musical arrangements seem off as well.
3,Doesn't work with our well water,"After researching this product, I bought it because of its claims to reduce the amount of iron in the water. We either have a lot of iron or it doesn't work. Either way, it is not filtering out the iron. Like another review, I also had problems with leaking, which never happened with other shower heads I have installed. I cannot rate the chlorine filtering because I have well water, but I wouldn't recommend it for iron."
1,Sent it back.,"The filter would not come out of the unit. I had to call dealer for help. He said they were veryhard to take out. Well, I am a senior and do not need hard things and if I had to change the filterit just was not worth the trouble. I could not believe others had not reported this."
4,"Great, but not perfect","This thing has a good spray pattern and it seems to help water quality...the water smells better now. The handle is fairly comfortable to hold onto.The bad points:-Plastic adapter/mounting fixture feels like it will break if I tighten it enough to stop the leaks.-Spray nozzle holder is somewhat small compared to the actual nozzle neck so it just barely barely sits in the holder.However, I do like it and I believe if I don't abuse it I'll have this filter/sprayer for a long time."
2,Trouble changing filters,"I've been using this filter for about a year and a half and while it does the job and the price was right, the filters are an absolute nightmare to remove. Every time the filter is due for a change I dread the 30 minutes it takes to wrestle the old one out of the handset. The one I just removed made a mess, since it was destroyed in the process. Would not recommend to anyone who does not have a great deal of hand strength and patience."
4,smooth skin,"My skin was dry and flakey before, now, smooth and almost silky. I am pleasantly surprised with the results. I may invest in a home unit."
5,Fantastic!,Great price and works great! My hair feels so much healthier and it's nice to know i'm no longer bathing in unhealthy heavy minerals like fluoride!
2,The price grabbed me,The price is right but the product results don't live up to other shower The Aquasana AQ4100 Shower Filter/ W extra headfilters I've used.
5,The best,"I really like this hand held, it has great water pressure but can be a gentle spray if you choose."
2,Two years old - cracked,"I think this unit has worked well enough to keep the majority of the rusty water from my hair, however two years on, I rotated the filter and when I turned it on, water sprayed everywhere, the handle had cracked and now will have to be replaced. This is after the holder broke, as many others have said, I bought a new one from the hardware store. They could do a bit better on the quality, methinks."
5,Another great book in this series!!!,I just love this book. The graphics are so nice... the children will really keep engaged and happy to read this book. Who doesn't love piggies & pancakes????
2,A very poorly written book............,"I've read this book to my daughter who loves it. I've also read the other books in the series. The illustrations are rather cute but the story is so poorly written. I feel anybody could have come up with the lame text this author has come up with. All her books are the same style and don't require much creativity or imagination. I give the book two stars because my daughter likes it and the illustrations are good. We borrow it from the library and I would never purchase it. For a good children's book, I think the British authors do a better job!"
3,A Dumb Book,"I think the book of ""If You Give A Pig A Pancake,"" is really dumb because it really doesn't make any sence. For example: I mean, really, if you think about it you would not give a pig a pancake in the first place. I think this is a stupid book for little kids to read. I think the only thing that I like about this book is the illustrations. I think they are so cute."
5,This title is a must have for your collection!,"As I sat in the bookstore reading this title to my 4 year old, she stayed glued to each word! Like those that came before, If You Give a Mouse a Cookie, and If You Give a Moose a Muffin...this book is a delightful tale which must be shared!"
3,Cute but Mouse/Cookie is better!,"If your child loves pigs, then get this book....if not, then stick to the ""If you Give A Mouse A Cookie"" book.This book does not seem to flow very well...seems a bit unbelievable what the pig goes through. The Mouse/Cookie book seems more connected and flows better.The pictures are cute in this Pig book, but not a reason to buy it.My suggestion - stick to the Mouse/Cookie book."
5,"Charming,delightful story!","This is a ""circular story"" where the reader encounters the same concept on the last page of the book as they see on the first page of the book. A charming book filled with opportunities for young readers to predict and problem solve as they read a delightful story about an interesting pig!"
2,Not what I expected....,"I love this story, and purchased the book as a Christmas gift for my niece. When the package arrived I was disappointed to find that the book was massively oversized (the book was about two feet tall!) I had to return it at my own shipping cost and buy a different copy at a brick and mortar store. Nowhere in the product description do I see it described as oversized."
4,Kids Love These Books,"My 6-yr-old daughter begged me to get this book thru a school book club, which I did. It continues the series of books (""If You Give a Mouse a Cookie"", and ""If You Give a Moose a Muffin"") which she absolutely loves. Years ago, we got ""If You Give a Moose a Muffin"". She loved it so much, I made it a point to get ""If You Give a Mouse a Cookie"", and eventually ""If You Give a Pig a Pancake"". She reads these books over and over. Yes, the storyline is ridiculous. That's the entire charm of the books! It's so off-the-wall, that it makes my daughter giggle with laughter every time."
4,So much fun for the little ones,"This book, and the accompanying pig doll, are adorable for preschool age children. My 5 year old son really enjoys reading the book with me - and sometimes he ""reads"" it to me.It is a cute way to encourage children's memory and illustrate how things sometimes go in circles.A wonderful treat for a birthday or holiday gift."
5,Great introduction for teaching cause/effect,"I have used ""If You Give a Pig a Pancake"" for a Literary Switch Day activity with students across grade levels 1-8. After reading this darling book, the students composed their very own school ""Because Story."" Each student did a watercolor picture to illustrate their words and then all of the pages were bound together for a school wide book which was added to the school library for all students to enjoy. I have also used ""If You Give a Mouse a Cookie,"" and ""If You Give a Moose a Muffin"" in the past."
3,Pigs + Pancakes = Trouble.,"If you like pigs then this fun filled book is deffinatley for you. i would recommend this book to ages 5-8. This book is about a pig who starts with a pancake and end's up with so much more, like some pictures, bubbles, even building a tree house plus more! But then everything goes wrong..."
3,"So, So",Just another variation on the first book (Mouse Cookie) and to me the story did not flow together as well. My kids like it though.
4,Not As Good,"As the ""give a mouse"" books, but still way better than alot of the mind-numbing books out there for kids."
1,Alex Proyas fans beware!,"I originally made a point to watch this film because it was advertized as being from Alex Proyas (who has made such great movies as The Crow, I Robot, the Knowing, Garage Days and one of my all time favorites... Dark City). However, Alex was only a producer on Riverworld. After watching it, I thought it was terrible. So I say if you were considering this film based on Proyas' connection, do your self a favor & skip it. Riverworld does not deserve to be listed on the same page as his other movies."
1,Avoid this like the plague,I watched this stinker on the Sci-Fi Channel when it first came out and was horrified. I've been a Riverworld fan since the first book was published in the '70s and I cannot believe that the makers of this thing had the audacity to name it after the great series by PJF. I can't believe that anyone who's read the books would actually recommend it. Perhaps some day a good movie version of the books will be made but this ain't it. This monstrosity needs to be buried and forgotten.
2,Could be good if...,"This film would have been a pretty good made for TV movie if it were a mini-series instead. I have read all of the Riverworld books, and tho the movie departs from them it portrayed the concept of the books rather well. If there were 2-3 sequel movies, this could have been good."
3,Great Movie,I remember when this movie permiered on the Scifi channel. I couldn't get enough of it. It has a great story filled with great characters. I cant wait to get my own copy of this flick
4,"If you liked this movie, try the book series...","I read the book series a while ago when I was a teen. My memory must be failing, but I think I liked the books better. I liked the movie. It was well done for the amount of material they tried to cover. My recommendation would be to read the book series. It starts with ""To Your Scattered Bodies Go"", by Philip Jose Farmer. I know you will enjoy."
1,don't watch if you are a fan,"This was a complete bastardization of the wonderful book by Farmer. The books were great and original, but SciFi channel boiled two of the novels down into a truely crappy film, barely recognizable from the source material. They should be ashamed. Read the books and never, ever watch the movie."
3,about this title of movie......,The story of this movie is average but is banned in Singapore for good(not sure why).
3,Good thriller!,"Good for an evenings entertainment. Predictable by nature. Well acted, reasonable apocalyptic score. If you liked this movie, check out ""Dealers"" with Rebecca De Mornay available only on VHS it would appear."
3,Review Rogue Trader DVD,"Review Rogue Trader DVD: The film was as good as expected, the quality was as expected. One negative observation: the DVD did not have any subtitles, not even English!"
5,One of Ewan's Best,"I am a big fan of Ewan McGregor and have seen most of his movies. I was hesitant to get this movie because the idea of money, trading, etc. seemed foreign and out of my league. You DO NOT have to know anything about trading to get into this movie. Ewan McGregor gives one of his best performances. You actually feel extremely nervous and uncomfortable as he gets himself deeper and deeper into trouble. You kind of feel like you're going to get in trouble for just watching! Great movie if you love suspense and a ""must own"" for any Ewan fan."
3,A fast ride to the bottom.,"Ewan Mcgregor once again in the based on a true story tale of a up and coming stock broker who gets the big gig and gets to run things his way Only to get himself and London's largest bank in a financial situation that posses no solutions. Good story, good message, super cinematography, not the best movie ever but still one of Mcgregors most sympathetic roles. Not a bad night out."
2,"Greed, Arrogance, and Bad Jackets","Unlike compelling stories of high finance and crime in films like the Thomas Crown Affair and Rollover, Rogue Trader purports to be the true story of Nick Leeson, a stock trader whose speculation brought down Barings, England's oldest bank. McGregor portrays Leeson as a charmer white collar criminal who ended up sentenced to six years in a Chinese prison for insider trading and fraud. Diagnosed with cancer, Leeson wrote his memoirs and low and behold it became a film. Ewan McGregor plays the self-absorbed, arrogant Leeson with his usual competence and energy. Anna Friel is his in the dark wife who yearns to be pregnant but can't interest her husband away from the trading floor. This is story of greed, larceny, and speculation on a grand scale. The film was never released in theaters but went straight to Showtime and has now been released for home sale. Skip it and rent it. Good acting, good story, but not a very compelling item for collectors of McGregor's work."
3,Amusing account of the Barings Bank collapse,"This movie is based upon Nick Leeson's personal account of events associated with the collapse of Barings Bank. The movie really does not give you a direct understanding of the events. A person really needs to read a document that is freely available through an internet search. Look for ""Chapter 7 Barings Bank PLC: Leeson's Lessons"".That document is really excellent and it does an exceptional job of helping the reader understand all the facets that went into the collapse. Rogue Trader is an interesting accent to the article, but not the other way around. The movie gives you a good idea of what Nick's perception of the events was. But that is the limit of its usefulness. If you want to really know what happened in the collapse of Barings Bank, you need to read the article described above."
3,The Stock Market? Ho-humm......,"I have to admit, when I popped this movie in the DVD player, I wasn't all that enthusiastic about seeing it. But if anyone can make the stock market and investing interesting, it ought to be Ewan McGregor, right? Wrong! Even an energetic actor like McGregor had trouble making a stock portfolio sound fascinating. Sadly, the boredom of watching his character sit at a desk and fret could have been overcome if there had been a real attempt at doing a character study of Nick Leeson and what really made him tick. There had to be more going on beneath the surface of this man than just an attempt to cover for one of his employee's mistakes. But you never really get a glimpse of who he is. On the level of simply getting a buzz from watching my favorite actor, McGregor, it was nice. But I just kept thinking--oh, if only the script had given you something to work with! Too bad."
1,REALLY BAD FLICK!,I only watched it for 2 reasons: it was lent to me; and ewan mcgregor was in it. This movie is even worse than Aspen Extreme! It's like watching paint dry...AND HE DON'T EVEN FLASH THE VIEWERS LIKE HE'S DONE IN OTHER MOVIES! Talk about a disappointment!
2,Risible,"The true story behind the fall of Barings Bank is fascinating. However, it is not fimic. This movie focuses on Ewan McGregor as an absurdly photogenic, charming version of Nick Leesson, the man whose improprieties caused that fall. McGregor's natural charm makes Nick seem far less culpable than he really was, despite the actor sleepwalking through an appalling script with some of the worst dialogue I can remember. Inept - or rather TV-movie-clumsy) direction doesn't help. There can be some forgiveness for ""true"" movies that invent episodes or make real-life characters to push a story along; there can be none for a movie that tells such a shallow version of the truth via its story's least interesting (if pivotal) character, and over-casts to make a boring futures trader look like a star."
4,International Intrique,"Crossing the line to be successful in a foreign country is as addicting as it is in the U.S.. This was big. Once started, it's impossible to turn around, as per Isaac Newton i.e. once in motion... Enjoyed the movie but it's one that requires you to stay in the room."
4,McGregor is fantastic,"Ewan McGregor in an extremely well acted role in the true story of the downfall of Britan's oldest financial institutions. Ewan plays a trader on the Singapore Stock Market who gets caught up in a high stakes gambling with his firms funds to cover up his own wagering, starting off as a simple small lose it snowballs into billions and he must fight against time to make back the losses before the deadline. McGregor's acting is great and you really get stressed yourself watching him go through everything he's that convincing. All and all a great suspense movie."
4,"Try to fight the market, and the result....Chapter 11","It really is a great movie. I've seen it twice from my friend and I still am going to buy it. This movie really takes you along with it to experience both pain resulted from greed and ambition, and a little success that made Leeson a hero.....for a limited time. Just shows you that the no matter how liquid or powerful you are, if you try to chase the market and win back your losses, you can end up losing everything."
3,"Good Lead Actors, Decent Movie","McGregor and Friel make a cute couple. While there's not a whole lot of depth, it is a fairly good translation of Nick Leeson's book."
4,Scary,I work in the financial market and it is very stressfull.Watching this movie actually stressed me out because it couldso easily happen to the company I work for.
3,2 out of 6 supplies failed within a couple months.,"This supply is the bare bones cheapest supply you could get. After purchasing 6 of these for my employer, 2 failed in short order with shorted power transformers, instantly blowing fuses. These units are still under warranty, but Pyramid requires you to pay return shipping to and from their repair depot for their crappy product. It will be interesting to see how long it takes them to repair these.By the way, the squealing noise that a reviewer mentioned is caused by the power supply regulator circuit going into oscillation during power down. Another clue of a not very good design."
2,no more pyramid,i was really happy with this product.when it worked. i bought it about a year or so ago. i use it to power car audio equipment in my house because i no longer have any desire for the loud speakers in my car anymore. used this product probably less than 50 times and a resistor burnt up inside of it. i emailed amazon about it and they were awesome. no problems or questions asked within a few days i had a response and noticed they had already shipped a new one to me which i recieved in about a week or less. so i sent the old one back in the new ones packaging and hooked up the new one to my car audio equipment. within a couple months the fuse blew so i replaced it with the same size fuse. tried several fuses and everytime as soon as i plug it in and turn it on it blows the fuse. now trying to get ahold of pyramid to resolve my issues and cannot get a response back from them. amazon...Great job. Pyramid...your awful
3,cheap,"fans a tad noisy, thay could have put lights in the meters,that would have been nice. but that would have costed them .50 cents extra to make it i guess."
2,Adequate But Nothing More,"I was disappointed to find that the meters are not illuminated, something I guess I took for granted. I emailed Sound Around's Tech Support department twice to verify that the meters were not lighted and were not, in fact, defective, and have gotten NO REPLY of any sort.The unit has developed a little squeek when I turn it off. It sounds like perhaps the fan bearings need more lube. I have no idea but this does not bode well for a one month old unit.Honestly, I would have returned it but it weighs 18 pounds and UPS shipping back to Amazon would have run $25 or more. (I received it from Amazon with free shipping.)The bottom line: You can do a lot better than this power suppply."
3,The Men with the Horn,"Michel Legrand arranged, orchestrated and conducted the music for the movie that co-stars Miles Davis as a jazz legend - the fictional character, Billy Cross - who lives in Paris.But it is trumpeter Chuck Findley who is featured on one-half of the cuts, so listeners hoping for a Davis soundtrack in the style of Ascenseur Pour L'echafaud will be sorely disappointed. The pieces fit well within the framework of the movie, though Findley carries the heavier load on the horn."
3,Mucho Davis,"Especial para coleccionistas. Al ser un titulo de musica de un film,y de no haber llegado a los catalogos de mi pais, representa un titulo en donde encontramos a Davis, inspirado, y con la orquestacion de Michael Legrand.Además podemos escuchar la vos de Miles en varios pasajes."
2,Disappointed,"I found very few recipes I was actually interested in making. We have ""Appetizer"" parties twice a year and I am always looking for good recipes. I could not find anything to add from this cookbook."
3,its ok,"its ok, but i was expecting more grafics, am a chef at a hotel and I always looking for ideas, recipies are ok, but more photos could make the difference"
3,three stars is not bad,"For the most part this is a good product. The joints are made well. The wash panel is made and designed well. The undulations are angled so the water moves downward.However, it could have been made just a little tighter width wise. The medal panel falls through when you use it. One of the nails on mine was shot through the inside edge so it split the wood on the inside. Not a good thing because this could cause a splinter injury."
4,Good washboard,"This washboard gets the job done at a decent price, I haven't had any issues with it yet. Seems to be somewhat durable."
4,Great instrument,"I'm using this as an instrument, not for washing clothes. As such, it works nicely. I suggest finding a bunch of thimbles somewhere, though :)"
3,What you would expect for the price,"The sound is about what you would expect for this price. Reasonable, but nothing to get too excited over. The aux jack is a nice touch. It's great for playing your ipod through speakers.The speakers are a bit light though; A heavy cord (like the power adapter cord) can pull the speaker off the shelf so you need to be sure your cords are long enough."
4,It sounds good for the price. I would buy again,"I was looking for good quality speakers, but did not want to spend a lot of money. These met my needs and I am glad I purchased them. Specially when they are used by children."
1,Useless,"I have a MacBook which does not have much volume on its audio so I was looking for external speakers to get a boost. With these plugged in and both the computer and the speakers at full volume, it is not any louder than the MacBook itself. The quality of the MacBook audio is as good as these speakers and maybe better. All in all, a waste of money in my view."
1,Speakers SUCK!!!,"I bought these to listen to music on my computer. Needless to say, I am very unhappy with them. They sound very distorted at higher volumes, and that little blue light is very annoying. DO NOT PURCHASE unless desperate!!"
3,Head doesn't snap on...,"The item was received on time, but later I found out that one of the heads (the one with the cut-off ear) doesn't snap on properly. Didn't know right away because it was a gift I sent to someone else... I think it was in a sealed package, so the seller may not have been aware of that..."
3,These work ok,The sandpaper rolls are difficule to install but this is more the machine than the paper rolls. They do do what they need to do.
1,Shopman,"This sandpaper does not fit the Jet 22-44 as advertised. It is 3"" wide not 3 1/8"" leaving gaps on the drum. It appears hand cut from a large roll. Better to get the right paper."
1,Poor excuse for sandpaper.,I have had problems with every type of sandpaper Jet sells for the 22-44 sanders. The paper is so cheap now it rips as you put it on the machine. It's trash. You end up throwing two of the four rolls out. Jet should be ashamed to sell shoddy sand paper like this.
5,Learn how to triumph over adversity and not be a victim,"Life trashes everybody sooner or later, in big and small ways. We can't always control what happens to us, but we have choices about how to respond. It is up to us whether we become chronic victims, blaming fate and everyone else for our problems, or use adversity to become stronger, wiser, happier. Al Sibert's excellent book is your guide to avoid becoming a professional victim. He offers keen insights and detailed, practical advice and guidance on how to use trauma or even the stress of daily life to make yourself a better person. This book should be required reading for all of us. Dr. Alexis Artwohl, author of DEADLY FORCE ENCOUNTERS"
4,Helpful,Haven't read all of this book but what I have read I find to be useful information. Give it a try.
3,Best for those who are already on their way,"I think this book is probably better for you, the better you are already dealing with life. For someone having survivor traits, it will re-enforce you. To me it seems less useful for those whose self-esteem was badly damaged in early childhood. Perhaps the author underestimates the damage that can be caused by early parental denigration of the child, and how long that influence can last. For some of these people, the book will further depress them when they encounter their inability to adopt the strategies that they know are good, and that the author favors. In my opinion, the book is better at describing survivor traits than at showing others how to succeed."
3,Amazing versatility,"This is not straight forward rock, but a very complex and enjoyable mixtures between rock, jazz and funk !!! It has great musicians by Gillan's side. It's a record to remember forever for those who love independece of compositions."
2,Really annoying ...,"Gillan musicians tried to be too much versatile in this album. They succeeded, but in doing so they did something very different from rock, sometimes really boring. So they did, that after that Gillan changed his mind and went back to straigh forward rock."
2,GILLAN'S WORST,"Even listening to it with an open mind, this cd sounded boring and confusing, as if the musicians were trying to prove how great they are and capable of alternating rhythms and tempo. The rsult is not a rock'n roll album, but some weird combination of genres, which is a good idea. But it didn't work at al.."
5,"Clear Writing, Easy to Understand","This book provides clear instructions for an amazing number of card games. It is amply illustrated, which makes learning new games even easier than you'd expect. I own several other card game books, but I found them to be overly complicated with stiff writing. I unreservedly recommend this book."
5,Madrid Fleximap,"For those who like to walk from place to place on vacation, these maps are invaluable for their street to street information. You can't get lost."
3,"Maelo's solo debut, not his best","After being released from prison two years before, he also broke away from Kako's band. I will say right off the bat that ""De Colores"" isn't as good as I expected, especially after how successful his previous album was. It features several boogaloos, something unheard of by Rivera and quite frankly, I don't remember him singing a boogaloo after this album. Several other tracks are just uninspiring and seem awkward coming from him. The title track is very good, highlighting as usual the pride of his heritage. Simply put, he has done better. Much better."
4,Makes charcoal organization easier,"My neighbor has the ""Performer"" from Weber which I believe comes stock with these. He uses them all the time for indirect cooking so I figured they would come in handy for my 7 dollar Weber kettle tri-wheel special. They have worked out great so far. The price is a little much for just two pieces of metal, but it really takes the pain out of organizing two piles of briquets on each side of the grill."
2,works well but there are better options,"The function of these work as expected. The downfall is the constuction sucks compared the the older ones Weber made. These are made of tin held together by small tabs that will come undone and spill the hot coals everywhere. When this happens, and it will, things turn into a real nightmare.There is a better option called The Smokenator sold here on Amazon. The smokenator is a 5 star item."
5,Nice product to have with your grill,This is a very cool product that I use a lot when I do my BBQ. I highly recommend this when you need to do slow cooking. It keeps the charcoals organized.
4,Pretty Cool,I like this little fuel basket set. It keeps the coals together when you want to create a two-zone fire. I have used this product about 6 times now. The only small con I find is that the lit coals near the ends don't hold their heat and are usually the first coals to die out. The coals in the center usually last (stay lit & hot)as they normally do. I use a Weber chimney to light my coals... and they burn bright red and then white hot before I dump them into these baskets. I would recommend these mostly to the grill-master who has it all. I find them worth the small cost I spent for them and as I said they work - just have to monitor your coals a little more than you may normally do. Great gift idea though.
4,Great for heat control,"These products are great to easily control and position your heat source in your grill. I only gave 4 stars because after a lot of uses they start to kind of fall apart from being hot all the time I presume.Be advised that by ""a lot of uses"" I mean a lot. I have used my current set in excess of 100 times and they're still barely starting to show degenerative changes."
5,One of my favs,"I didn't really care about her being Vanessa Bell Armstrong's sister. I was following two of my favorite producers, BeBe Winans and Tim Miner.I was familiar with Tim's style and rep as a singer and producer of Urban/Pop/Rap. But other than Al Green and Deleon, the majority of his work was on ""no name"" artists. So because BeBe had a Mainstream presence, I figured that if they both were on this project, it had to be awesome -- and it was.Highlights: What You Do (the near twin of Whitney Houston's ""I'm Your Baby Tonight), I Choose To Be A BelieverTruSoulDJ"
5,We Should All Go bAck to Nature,"I love these crackers for several reasons. They are absoutely delicious, to begin with. And they do not use ingredients like ""partially hydrogenated soybean oil."" They are hard to find in stores. It's a hit or miss thing, here in the Northeast. So I ordered from Amazon. Propmpt delivery, and ease of purchasing will keep me coming back."
2,"slow moving plot, lots of description","This book is big on description, slow on plot. I had a hard time reading it aloud to my children. The author uses too many words to describe what is happening."
5,trust me on this,"if you don't have this album and you even remotely think that you're a true hip-hop head, buy this sh!t right now. From the incredible production on tracks like ""Reality Check"" to the storytelling of ""Glen Close"" to the all-out war flavor of ""One Man Army"" to the pounding of ""KGB"" (J.U.I.C.E.'s flow on KGB is seriously ill) this album has it all. The rhyme style is somewhere in between ""Illmatic"" and ""36 Chambers"" with beats similar to the likes of ""Lifestylez ov da Poor and Dangerous"" and ""Mecca and the Soul Brother."" Rap Hezbollah, you ain't seen nothin' yet!"
5,Oh my God,"Man this by far the best all around underground album I have ever heard. It is even up there for me with Illmatic and 36 Chambers. Everything the good reviews said was right and those who reviewed it poorly are signed on competing independent labels that suck ass. Senim Silla has the best flow of any emcee I've ever heard and One Man Army is good too.There is no filler in this album. Every track is unique, and of course ill. I just can't believe that no one has mentioned my favorite track on the album yet, Solar Powered. That ish is just completely ridiculous with the flow. The beat is always in my head.This is the Hip-Hop album you've been waiting to obsess over."
5,Indescribeable,"I have never heard a hip hop album like this. It's incredable, intelligent, funny, real, dope and lyrical all at the same time. The punchlines are THE BEST i have ever heard. I mean ""I rock heads like Mt. Rushmore,"" is straight hilarious.If people don't like this album it's because they don't understand it -- point blank. It ain't for ig'nant mofos, it's for the real intellectual cats. If you're looking for a true hip hop, like I was, you'll find it right here."
5,UNBELIEVEABLE FROM START TO END,"This album is to rap, what porn is to lonely people, two hands full of something you don't want to let go of. While hip-hop is going on a downward spiral of absolute chintzy garbage, and cancerous crud that make your ears bleed, this dynamic group, let's loose on the album of the century. They make me feel that rap is real music again.I mean this album is the most signifcant thing to happen to rap, since Canibus joined the Army. What a relief! I keep a copy for my stereo, so when I wake up, there is the bittersweet sounds of lyrical caligraphy sending a tickle through my body, while one in my discman, so if I can't hear a car raging behind me, I die with good music.Buy it, live it, love it. Goodbye, and Float."
5,Real Hip-Hop CLASSIC,"Good stuff comin' out of this album. These guys got skill. ""Conquistadors"" has some of the best rhymes I have ever heard, and the beat is live as hell. ""Fellowship: is another ill track that has great rhymes and a nice drop added with it. ""Wolf Man Jack"" brings back an old legend and the art of storytellin' through music. I guarantee that if you love real hip-hop, you will love this album."
4,Not great,Not the best of the music world ... but Its good enough to listen through all the way. I'd reccomend downloading a couple of their songs on audiogalaxy before buying it ...
3,Hmm.. Ok.. but I was expecting more..,"First.. Don't get me wrong, this album isn't trash.I bought it because I liked the samples and rhyming on ""Fellowship"". There are a few good tracks in my opinion, mostly near the beginning with ""Reality Check"", Conquistadors"", and ""Slang Blade"". The other ones.. are OK, but nothing as memorable as ""fellowship"".To tell everyone what kind of music I'm into, I like Das EFX, Cypress Hill, Sage Francis, Deltron 3030, Public Enemy, (OLD) Snoop Dog and Black Sheep just to name a few. So if your interests go along that route, you may get some decant playability out of it. As I said, It's not bad and they make a good effort into bringing out the old school in hip hop that isn't there anymore.I think the best constructive criticism that I can give Binary Star is to work on the samples. Some of them really didn't hook (the latter half of the album I got really bored of), even though the rhyming in all respects were ""spot on""."
3,mediocre to say the least...,"i could understand why listeners would rate this a 5 because don't get me wrong , it's a pretty decent listen. For something that came out in the year 2000 this album is very typical, and hip hop newcomer would have ate this up at the time. I came across the vinyl which was chillin in a crate for the past 7 years, and I decided to give it a run through, but my reaction was the same as when i first listened to it. For the diggers out there, the production isn't very impressive, especially some of the drums used througout the album. There's a couple tracks, by that i mean a couple, that are worth listening to (towards the middle of the album). The cuts are kind of wack. I thought that i might have slept on this album because of the highly esteemed internet reviews, but this album is average at its best. give it listen if you're that bored, but don't say i didn't warn you."
1,Boring,"Let me begin by saying that I'm a fan of underground recordings. Jedi Mind tricks, Freestyle Fellowship, Self Scientific, etc., I like them all or can find some redeeming factor even in songs I don't care for. I listened to this CD 2 times and threw it away. The beats didn't satisfy me at all, the lyrics are ok but the delivery is monotonous. If you don't have beats and you don't have flow, what DO you have? A lame album. Sorry Binary Star, this CD sucked."
1,don't waste your money,"I completely agree with the previous ""boring review."" I gave this album a few chances, even though the first listen gave me no reason to ever listen again. I love underground hip hop, but this album is intolerable: I couldn't even give it away. Finally sold it at a used place for 50 cents. Very dull, poor production, average lyrics."
1,Dis album be wack y'all!!!!!!!!!!!,"I ain't no what y'all is listenin' 2, but it ain't real hip-hop. What up wit' all dis undaground stuff, man. Y'all punks need to look up hip-hop in y'all dictionaries like Jayadeep said. Fo real, what's up wit all dem untitled ""hidden"" tracks anyway. Get a grip on yo hip-hop, and find da real stuff. Undaground hip-hop is good, but this put a bad display ov it. Aight, i'm out. Word."
4,classy music,This song reminds me of the way music used to be done. It has an infectious rhythm and clever lyrics. I find myself humming this song regularly. I also added this song to my love rotation in my cd player. ENJOY!
4,Greatest songwriter ever,"Justin Hayward is the best songwriter and singer I have ever heard. Started listening to him in 1968,have nearly every song he has writen and sung, and would buy anything he made. Not a bad song on the cd. Some are just better than others like Moving Mountains, Silverbird, Is It Just a Game, Lost and Found, and The Lights are Low. They are the best. I can listen to them over and over."
5,Works great with a fair price.,I installed this faucet on an older (~1960) Belvedere shampoo bowl. It's working great with no drips. Nice finish as well. I would have liked to see a rubber seal to go under the faucet since it didn't have one with it. I laid a very small bead of silicone after installing the faucet to take the place of the gasket. I would recommend to anyone.
4,French new wave..? why not,"I grew up,hearing great british New Wave bands, when friend told me about'em, i'd even laugh....But they do not envy anything to great bands like New Order,The Cure,Echo & the bunnymen...They have it all....buy it, at least their greatest hits..."
2,Save Your Money!,"Save your money. Don't buy this filter. Very poor quality filter and prefilter. Buy the name-brand Sunbeam filter. Amazing what a difference in quality Sunbeam filter is to this knock-off brand. There is no edging to seal the gap between the air cleaner and the filter. Therefore, this is allowing air to flow around the filter rather than through it. Not a tight fit at all. Very disappointing. But as the old saying goes....you get what you pay for! Spend the extra $2-$3 and get the name brand Sunbeam filter. It is well worth it. The first and LAST time I will buy the filter."
4,FILTERS,GREAT FILTERS-BUT THEY WHERE A FEW MM SMALLER THAN THE ORIGINALS-BUT THEY STILL WORK FINE IN MY SUNBEAM AIR PURIFIER
1,Do NOT buy this product,"I received this product and it stinks! Literally. It has a plasticy smell that does not goes away!!! Febreeze didn't work, airing it out for weeks, putting it in the dryer with downy sheets. Nothing. Do not buy this, spend a little more money for something better."
5,"The original, not the Disney version","This is, of course, a wonderful story but it is the original story not the Disney version. I was so happy to find this book. My daughter borrowed this book from school and lost it. I couldn't find it anywhere except Amazon. I truly enjoyed reading it. It's amazing how many fairytales have been rewritten by Disney. It's nice to read the originals every once in a while."
3,Don't rent it for Anthony Michael Hall.,"I bought this DVD on the cheap, hoping for a nice dose of Anthony Michael Hall. I was disappointed in that respect because he shows up for maybe a total of ten minutes, and doesn't appear to be making maximum effort with his performance. That said, this is an interesting film and I give it three stars because it's certainly not great, but it's good enough to pop into the DVD player for some campy entertainment. At the end of the day, I'm glad to have added it to my collection. And besides, some Anthony Michael Hall is better than none."
1,No suspense at all! totally silly movie!!!!!,"This movie is nothing but a dull, dreadful, & boring piece of film. The killer (a lady) in the movie is so unbelievable in the the role, and the lead lady cop (a star from Baywatch), is totally out of place playing this kind of part!!! The movie consist of absolutely no suspense at all! I could not help notice when I was watching the movie that it looked like on of those horrible so-called thriller movies that you see on the Lifetime channel. The movie is like a bad cop show!"
4,More fun some repetition,"Nicole Hollander's grasp of cat-human relations (you'll note which comes first) is pure genius, and in this second collection she was again delivers some of the most side-splitting bits of prose I've ever come across. Of course, to be fair, I do suppose you have to be something of a cat lover (or at least, live with cats) to understand her wit and humor -- in other words, the concept of two cats holding their owner's 1040 hostage for food might be lost on the uninitiated.The only negative thing I will say is that this particular volume, ""My Cat's Not Fat, He's Just Big Boned"", contains some of the same material as her earlier ""Everything Here Is Mine"", which is the only reason I gave it four stars and not five."
4,"Spin Doctors are in the ""House"".","What, just because these guys only released one huge album before their popularity passed doesn't mean they can't put together a great ""Best Of""? It's true the debut ""Pocket Full Of Kryptonite"" was their best album, but many good songs came afterwards. This collection takes pretty evenly from their first 3 albums. Included are the monster hits ""Two Princes"", ""Little Miss Can't Be Wrong"", and ""Jimmy Olsen's Blues"", plus this has ""Cleopatra's Cat"", ""I Can't Believe You're Still With Her"", and a live ""Refrigerator Car"". This band is a good cross between the ""Red Hot Chili Peppers"" and ""Blues Traveler"", and I think it's time to give them another ""spin""."
4,Just your nothing special greatest hits album,"Yes I bought this cd. And all your getting is a collection if some old spins tunes. That's just about it. If the spins had made it a ""best of"" (as in they picked the songs that they thought were their best, not there most popular) album it would have a better track listing."
3,Decent But Better Off Getting The Original CD's,"If you would rather go with the quick route in collecting songs by the Spin Doctors, this CD is a decent alternative. It features many of their great songs like Little Miss Can't Be Wrong, Two Princes, Jimmy Olson Blues, You Let Your Heart Go To Fast, What Time Is It, and You've Got To Believe In Something. However,the first Spin Doctors CD, Pocket Full of Kryptonite certainly stands on its own merits and you the listener will miss out on many great songs.Also the second CD has some good songs like More Than Meets The Ear and Beasts In The Woods that are not on this collection. There is a hidden track cover version of That's The Way I LIke It(on another CD0 that is notably missing.So my opinion would be to get Pocket Full of Kryptonite and possibly the second CD as opposed to this non-all inclusive compilation."
2,I Dont Understand.....,"The 1st thing I would like to share is... Ok have the noticed that this is the 21 century... This sounds like the late 80ty going into the 1st 90ty's.. I once was a Spin Fan with the other album they had I thought it was cool and all, so I see they have came out with a new cd. I was like cool so I bought and after I put it into my cd player I dont see why it didnt just reject it... I thought that this would be cool and with some fresh new toons... Well I was wrong ... So if you plan on buyin this cd i strongly suggest using it just to complete the collection.. I guess they tryed hard so I'll give em 2*'s for effort..."
5,"Man, this is so easy",Simply insert your card into the card reader and the reader into the USB port of your PC/Laptop. The pictures are immediately available for download after popping up on the screen. Could not be simpler.The card reader is small and easy to carry which is an added bonus. Easiest card reader to use that I have found. Good price too.
