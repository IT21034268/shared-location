1,Cannot give what it deserves: a 0 star,"New remakes after more then 20 years are ALWAYS plain trash. The band is too much older, but anyway, collectors are looking for original recordings. DON'T BUY IT!."
1,Remakes and Bad Sounding Demos,"Varese Sarabande really blew it with this CD. Obviously, they could not get licencing from ABKCO for the original hit recording of ""96 Tears"", so they offer (much later) remakes. The demos sound really bad, in quality."
1,"Get the 1995 release, not this one","This is a reissue of the original 1995 version, and on this one, the tracks are separated by a 2 second gap. If you know this album, you know that most of the songs are mixed together to flow like one long track. When they redid the album, I guess the creators forgot to make the CD gapless and now there is an awkward pause between each track even though it was made to be a megamix. Buy the other one :)"
3,An interesting tool,"I purposely choose to name this book ""Easy web design"" a tool because it is really a tool with which to work. Mary Millhollon and her companion did a good job. The use of non-complicated terms is appreciated. The division of the book into various parts as the talk (part I); the walk (part II) and the rest(part III)is very important and helpful. The part one presents basic ideas regarding the web. Part two delves into the creation of web sites while part three treats going live, that is, rendering public the created site. Very intesresting is the time care dedicated to the XHTML and the CSS topics. I've gone through the book and I can recommend it for anyone interested in designing web sites even from the scratch. My general consideration of the book is that it worths the pain and the cost. It is true it has not treated every detail, but then no book has ever treated all the details regarding a topic. It is a nice tool on web desingning."
4,"Good Reference for Randolph County, WV","This is a good reference book for Randolph County, WV. Lots of information, and many biographies. Some biographies are more extensive than others, but almost all of them have very specific genealogy information which would be very helpful to anyone researching their family tree in this are of the country."
4,Typical Hu Maxwell work,"This book as all others written by Maxwell is very complete. He also wrote History of Tucker County, which I have read. I am researching a book about my forefathers in these counties and find very useful information in them, about characters and happenings of the times. Mr. Maxwell obviously had to do tons of research for these books and for the times they were produced are very complete.MF"
4,Great iron!,"This is my 3rd T-fal iron. I love them! I iron a lot & find this is hands down the best iron, especially for this price. It's light & very easy to use. My only issue is you have to lay it down to fill it. I find that a little awkward, but I can live with it. I highly recommend it. I hope this one lasts a long time, but when it goes I'll be getting another t-fal."
4,Good,"I had this iron for about 3 years now and it is still working pretty well. The only problem is filling the water tank can be messy and sometimes it leaks. Other than these problems that happens once in a while, it is a good iron."
1,Not good...,"Pros: Light and it's really gliding when you are ironingCons: It doesn't do it's job at all. Even if i turned up to the max heat setting, I can't even get the shirt iron properly. There were still lines after a few irons, even with steam. I returned the product eventually and got black & decker, which works so much better although it's heavier."
1,leaks like a waterfall,"Got this iron for Christmas within a month it was leaking water every time I used it. The water just leaks from the bottom and the sides, I have not dropped it or done any damage but am tempted to throw it across the room everytime I use it."
1,Mine leaks and is going back today,"I bought this iron based on the reviews here. Mine may have been defective, but at the highest steam setting, even at the highest temperature, it leaks water through the soleplate holes."
5,Perfect for my needs,I've used my new Tfal iron for several weeks and it works great. Steams good with no dripping or water leakage. It heats quickly and does a great job getting the wrinkles out even in jeans. It's got a generous sole plate which makes ironing faster and is adequately lightweight. All in all a good product. Very satisfied with the product.
2,"Looks nice, but has issues","What an attractive iron. Beautiful on the outside, but the inside needs work. It leaks when the iron hasn't reached a high enough temperature. The steam seems to function when the iron is held upright, yet doesn't provide adequate steam in the horizontal position (used when ironing)."
5,t-fal iron,Works better than any iron I've had since leaving my mother's home. It heats up fast and does not require going over fabric several times.
4,T-Fal Iron,"After reading reviews on zillions of irons I decided on the T-Fal. I didn't even know that T-Fal made irons just kitchen cookware. The iron is very good with steam, shot of steam, and spray. My only complaint is that if you are doing a big load or ironing and you need to refill the water container the iron must stay flat on your ironing board in order to fill the container. I guess if you had a ""plate"" of some sort for the iron to sit on it might be better. My worry was that by the time I filled the container my ironing board cover would be burning. Fortunately that did not happen."
1,"Tie Down Engineering 86119 60"" Heavy Duty Post Guide-on","This Tie Down Engineering 86119 60"" Heavy Duty Post Guide-on is the worst case of galvanizing I have ever seen. Poor coverage and ugly makes me wonder how long this will last when used in salt water environment...."
4,Awesome,"A perfect mix of blues and rock. Dale Krantz-Rossingtons voice reminds you of icons such as Janis Joplin and Stevie Nicks. Takes you back to a time when rock and roll was Rock and Roll!! If you are a fan of Lynyrd Skynyrd, then this band comprised of the remaining members (Gary Rossington, Allen Collins, Billy Powell, and Leon Wilkeson plus female vocalist named Dale Krantz-Rossington) will not disappoint. This 1980 debut album from Rossington Collins met with critical and commercial success, unfortunately it was not to be repeated. If you just like great music, then definitely add this to your collection."
4,Good but slightly small,"I was a bit surprised how small this board looked when it arrived. I had expected a larger board because it is advertised as being 10.5 inches long. Minus the grip and the channel (pretty wide), the actual cutting surface is 8.25 inches x 6 inches. If you need a bigger board, this one may not be for you."
4,Nice little cutting board...,"I use this to cook in the dorms and it comes in especially handy when I go to someone else's room to cook. Larger enough to be useful, but small enough to be portable.I've had it for almost a year now and it starting to get a little fuzzy from all the cuts on one side, but it hasn't been stained by any food yet. The juice rivulets on one side are nice for cutting fruit and not making a mess. And it hasn't damaged my knife so I can't complain.I will most likely buy the larger version of this board in a year when I have a proper kitchen."
5,Good for camping,"I bought this for my camping set because of its compactness. I use it from everything to cutting butter, meat, veggies and fruit. It's way cleaner than cutting on the picnic table and much easier than cutting things on a plate. Buy this if you don't already have a cutting board in your camping gear!"
2,Not very good,"Small and cute clip board. but when not eazy-washing. Plus, I doubt its duration, since it's easy to see the cuts."
2,really small and scores really easily,"I was hoping that this ""cutting board"" would actually let me cut on it and not score so easily. I'm replacing a much larger one because it has so many cuts in the board. It's so hard to really clean the board when it's all scored. I'd think a cutting board would mark up so easily. The rubber edging does help hold it in place slightly, if your counter is level and smooth. I have tile so it's not perfectly even, and therefore the rubber doesn't always catch and hold. It wasn't one of my better purchases."
4,small but does the job,"its a little smaller than i realized (even after reading the reviews), but i have a small kitchen and its just us two, so i dont need a huge one. easy to clean and feels good."
4,OXO MUST STAND FOR HUGS OOOO AND KISSES XXXX,"I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT I AM VERY PREJUDICED TOWARD OXO - I WAS GIVEN A NUMBER OF OXO KITCHEN GADGETS ABOUT 8? 10? YEARS AGO BECAUSE I HAVE TERRIBLE ARTHRITIS, CARPAL TUNNEL AND NOW NEUROPATHY IN MY HANDS - I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE PRODUCTS IMMEDIATELY - I'VE HAD TWO BATTERY OPERATED CAN OPENERS OVER THE YEARS BUT FIND I ALWAYS GO FOR MY HAND HELD OXO - EVEN WHEN I'M OPENING UP ENOUGH CANS TO MAKE 12 QUARTS OF SPAGHETTI SAUCE - SO YOU SEE I REALLY AM PREJUDICED TOWARD OXO AND THIS LITTLE CUTTING BOARD IS NO EXCEPTION TO THE RULE - HOWEVER, KEEP IN MIND THAT IT'S SMALL - IT'S GOOD FOR CUTTING A PEPPER OR AN ONION OR A SMALL BLOCK OF CHEESE OR AN APPLE BUT DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE FILET CHICKEN CUTLETS OR CARVE A ROAST ON IT OR EVEN CUT UP A CANTALOUPE ON IT - IT'S VERY SMALL BUT IT'S STURDY, IT GRIPS WELL TO SURFACES AND THE MATERIAL IT'S MADE OUT OF CLEANS UP WELL."
3,"Ok, but....","This cutting board is really too small for anything more than a small onion. If I have to get another board, it will be larger and one that is flexible, not stiff...those are much more practical."
4,Great cutting board,"I use these cutting boards every day. They are excellent in the dishwasher and don't dull knives. They do stain a little bit after using for a few months, some things don't wash off as easy as they should. On one side there is a little ridge that runs the perimeter presumably to catch juices that flow from whatever you are cutting; this is pretty helpful. There are rubber feet on both sides so the board doesn't slide around. Overall great though, my favorite cutting board!"
1,not durable,The board is thick but not strong. It's easy to see the cuts and mine broke into two pieces after a few use (and I wasn't cutting hard at all). Plus this guy is slippery on the counter! Overall disappointing~
5,NICE LITTLE BOARD,I THOUGHT THIS WAS A LITTLE TOO SMALL AT FIRST BUT NOW IT'S OUR FAVORITE CUTTING BOARD. I PLAN ON ORDERING MORE OF THEM.
5,Take the time to measure,"This cutting board was much smaller than I thought it would be, which is of course totally my fault. I failed to measure my idea of the dimensions against anything physical. THe cutting board is exactly as described, and OXO creates really good quality products."
5,Best value,"Not only is his board great for dry products but flip it over and you have the drain grooves for cutting tomatoes and other runny products. Again, I don't need a 2 foot board brought out to cut one roll or one onion. Best value delivered.In my opinion OXO makes great products and Amazon made it easy to find what I needed at a great price."
4,Nice but tiny,"This is a very small cutting board, so i wouldn't recommend it for your main one. However, its very comfy to hold, and looks great on a bar or something for cutting limes and such, and for that I would highly reommend it!"
1,Terrific.....Unless You're Concerned About Safety,"I love OXO products & have a kitchen full of them. This cutting board, however, is disappointing. The material is terrific, but the workmanship is off. The board is is warped. It does not sit firmly & flatly on the countertop and slides all over the place. I cook a lot & cannot imagine using this for food prep. I purchased this as a replacement for the larger one, which I returned, which was also warped. This one will go back, as well. The small one was perfect."
5,Get several of these,"Great size for all kinds of stuff, I have 3 and they get 90% of all cutting board use in my kitchen. Small enough to easily go in dishwasher, large enough for most cutting tasks. No stains have set in yet. I have a couple larger ones and one huge one, as well as a round wooden one for bread only, and that's a good inventory."
5,Slayers Rules!,"I cannot stop watching this tape! It is so good! Great twists in the plot, some stuff you don't really expect, and some you do. I really love the addition of the new bad guy, Valgaav, to the Slayers series. Definately one of the better enemies. If you love Slayers, then this tape is a must see! Although I do suggest watching the first three tapes from the Try series first, since otherwise you would be totally lost. ^^'"
4,A classic among afterlife enthusiasts,"Considered by most as a classic among classics, this book has changed many and created many people's opinions and beliefs about the afterlife experience. A little hard to read at times, due to the archaic grammar, but invaluable to the student of religion."
5,L`amor che move il sole il`atre stelle.,"In his COMMOEDIA, Dante summarized the medieval thinking, much of the human history and his own general knowledge , beyound throwing his principal criticized people (for their behaviours and decissions) on the supplicies of the Hell. Infantile opinnion will it be to judge the FLORENTINII NASCENTI NOR MORIBUS just for his heavenly poetry. In the COMMOEDIA, as in any literary work, the need is to feel the pleasure as trying to understand what we`re reading, for occult, science and moralism are among the songs of immortality. For us, readers, is the work to delight the glory of Dante`s travel and discern his immense intolerence. May Virgilii, the human reason, lead us. So that we labour our fate, beyound the power of the BELLE STELLE. DIXIT."
1,Does not fly. Bad Quality,Very disappointed. I bought for a trip to Central Park with the kids. The plane looks good but does not fly. Do not buy.
2,Strictly for the locals,"I have been spending a lot of time in Western Essex County over for the last few months, and I picked up a couple of books in this series. Like the others I have reviewed (West Orange, Livingston), I find this one to suffer from a lack of focus. The photos are haphazardly arranged without any overarching order. I don't mean to offend anyone who lives in this beautiful area. I'm sure the book holds a lot of pride for them. But for someone like me, I honestly didn't learn much."
3,different views on architectural practice,"This is actually a collection of essays from a conference organized at the GSD. Architects are invited to contribute their thoughts on what they consider to be the biggest factors influencing practice.However, it is impossible to go into much depth when all you have is 5-7 pages of text. This also contributes to the at times repetitive at others disjointed nature of the book as a whole."
4,Very Enjoyable Read,I picked this up at the library just because I like the cover ;). Turns out the book behind it was just as enjoyable. A nice story that is a very fast and easy read...perfect for a Sunday afternoon. Great for any fan of historical fiction.
1,???,I realy can't rate this shirt because I never got it the company sent me some kind of fireman shirt instead of the EMT shirt that I ordered
5,Product Quality,"The Product was above what I expected, delivery time was great ""But"" better yet was the Customer Service !!!!I would give them a 5 by 5 rateing"
2,gel plant soil,The crystals did not produce nearly as much product (gel) as it was labeled. I have purchased this type of product several times from other vendors. Disappointed in lack of quantity once hydrated by instructions.
1,don't buy refurbished,this company advertised refurbished and this item was apparently not completely checked out.What aggravated me the most was that I had to pay the postage to return an Item that did not work as advertised.I will never again buy a so called refurbished item or from this seller again.
1,Buyer Beware,"This model worked well for the first few days that I owned it. Then I started to notice that my TV made clicking sounds while the VCR was on. I disconnected the VCR and the clicking stopped. A few weeks later, I needed to use the VCR again so I reconnected it to my TV. The clicking sounds resumed, and occasionally the TV would shut itself off and then turn back on a few minutes later. I disconnected the VCR but my TV continued to have problems. A few weeks later, the TV was dead. I borrowed a spare TV from my boyfriend to get by until I bought a new TV. I did not have any problems with his TV until I stupidly hooked up the VCR to record a show for him. His TV did not work after recording the show. Now I need to buy 2 replacement TVs and a VCR thanks to Sylvania."
4,Thank goodness someone still sells these,"Sorry, but we are old fashioned and still like to record things from TV the old way (cartoons for the grandkids and an occasional movie to watch later). When our old VCR died, I figured no problem, I see them for sale everywhere. What I didn't realize was that most of the new combo units do not have the video in cable to make it possible to record from the TV. Took me awhile to find this one, but it works well for what we need it for. It's not really high end, but perfect for our needs and budget."
3,"Great start, disappointing end","I started reading this book as part of an on-line book club. I enjoyed the first 5 pages so much that I bought the book. The book started out great. However, I was disappointed in the last half of the book. I found the plot line very simplistic. I would have liked to see the author use the plot line to explore the S'sinn/Human differences and build a better relationship between the two races. Instead the author falls back on a Deus ex machina plot gimmick of Jarrikk and Katy's ability to make others do as they bid to resolve the confict."
3,Not very stable - definitely more of a toy than luggage.,"It is a very interesting concept, but is not an ideal piece of luggage. There is nothing in the case to make things stay in place on either half of the case. Also, if a kid decides to ride it, it has a tendency to tip forward despite the little protrusion that is supposed to prevent the tipping. Also, if you are a family of more than one kid, do yourself a favor, either buy one for each kid or do not buy at all. The last thing one needs on a long international journey is two kids fighting over a piece of luggage."
4,Andrea Berg - Weil Ich Verliebt Bin,"J'aime beaucoup les chansons de cette chanteuse.Par contre ce CD m'a un peu déu car il a été très mal enregistré, le fond sonore est trop élevé car il couvre les paroles.Heureusement que les autres enregistrements sont bien meilleurs."
2,poor compilation from an otherwise great series,"The Rough Guide series is generally an outstanding way to learn about a new genre by sampling tracks of the highest musicianship.Nothing against Calypso and Soca- these are both dynamic and expressive genres. But this compilation reflects the modern trend towards downsized horn sections replaced by synthesizers. The problem with synthesized horn sections- and I think this is beyond just a matter of taste- is that the authenticity of the sound is limited by the current state of the art technology. So rather than sounding timeless, this music is dated by its technology. Rawness and energy are lacking on this compilation, which could best be described as cheesy."
5,Old Time Radio Fan,"If you were born in the 30's or 40's and listened to the radio this product should bring back fond memories. I remember very well, when I was very young, sitting around the radio with the rest of my family, on Saturday and Sunday nights listening to Adventure, Mystery, Detective, and Humorus Radio Programs. This was before the age of Television. When I saw this item for sale I purchased it and my family and I listened to the stories in our car while traveling on vacation. Even our young sons who were skeptical, sat back and listened and later discussed how, although a little kinky, they were interesting stories that made you use your imagination. I would reccommend this item to us old folk to go back in time and to the younger generation to understand what life was like before computers, cell phones, i-pads and pods, etc."
1,Irritating to listen to and a faulty CD,"The set is mediocre in mystery/suspence content compared to it's comtemparies of the same period. The sound quality is poor. It was dull and muffled through out the entire collection and the volume was not consistent. The Special Bonus CD, TV's Greatest Shows Originating form Early Radio, would not play. I tried it on three different CD players. This is not worth the money or the time listening!"
4,Classic Blues Compilation,"This is a great blues compilation - from Muddy Water's eternal ""Hootchie Kootchie Man"" to Little Walker's ""Boom Boom Out Go The Lights"" (which was a hit for Pat Travers in the 70's) these are classic blues tunes from the mid fifties. A great album for anyone who wants to get a good sampling of what the Blues are all about."
5,This book has changed my life!,"I re-read this book (or at least a portion of it) every month or so, just to remind myself of what kind of person I want to be. It's positive suggestions have really made me be a better person. I'm a teacher, and I've actually posted up some of the suggestions on the walls of my classroom, in an attempt to make my students more positive and peaceful. The book makes a great gift for any occasion, for any person."
3,Pretty Good For the price,"Used it during a ""welcome home soldiers"" party. The kids loved it. We used it as the Badminton game. It held up well. The handles of the rackets are not very strong- but you should just be careful not to hit the bars or any other hard surfaces.Over all- it was fun using it."
2,I would've been satisfied....,it was what I wanted to order but the fact it was for a xmas gift and it was suppose to be new the carrying case shouldn't have arrives torn
1,Worst Item,"The item that came with a ripped cover. The racquets were of very poor quality. No clear instructions on how to mount the net, etc.I finally had to return the product. Please do not buy this product."
2,No shuttlecocks.,"There were no shuttlecocks in the packaging we received even though the picture on the product page shows two in the bag. I'm not sure if this was just an oversight with our product, but it's pretty sad for a ""set"" to be missing such an important part."
3,"Good music, not loud enough","This CD seems to have been recorded with a single microphone in a large room from far away, however, background noise is minimal, so turning up the volume for playback is not much of a problem. You can hear the echo in the room, it seems, which makes for a more of a ""live"" sound. It's good music, I wish I could hear it a little better, so I'll put up with using headphones."
2,bizarre recording,"The music is beautiful, but the production values are bizarre. Maybe I just got a bad disc, but one has to play this disc at almost twice the normal volume in order to hear it and the amplitude seems to rise and fall throughout the recording."
1,"Le Creuset 7-Piece Spatula Set with Crock, Blue",I bought these because I liked my Mom's set but when I got them they were bigger than her spatulas. The spatulas were flimsy and you wouldn't be able to scrape out anything thicker than pancake batter. I was very disappointed in the quality and returned them.
1,Waste of Money,"Sadly, this book was a waste of money. It was a gift, with paints, for my husband. I was looking for instructions on using the water mixable oils, not painting techniques, and this book offered nothing. I should have purchased the book by Sean Dye but I went with the less expensive. You get what you pay for."
2,No good!,"When I bought this for my sister, it work that well either. If I were you, I would get a EA Sports controller instead. Its more responsive than the Barbie controller. And it's more cheaper."
1,Glad this is discontinued,Does not keep the water warm as stated. Infrared heat is useless because it never heats to a noticeable temperature.
4,Quick Relief for mouth sores,"My husband has a terrible time with mouth ulcers. Any time he bites his cheek or gets any kind of laceration inside his mouth he always develops an ulcer on the same spot. Needless to say we've been looking for something to help speed healing and relieve the pain for a while and have tried TONS of stuff that hasn't worked very well. This product however has by far been the absolute best product we've come across thus far and my husband has been using it consistently for almost two years now. While it doesn't give him complete and immediate healing, it has cut his healing time in half at least and has significantly reduced the pain. Overall, it's a great product!"
2,Didnt work!,"My mom and I both have the mouth ulcer problem, its so annoying! too much pain, it goes all over my tongue and thoat, i was hoping this bottle will help us, but it didn't! its so miserable, we can't even eat or drink! =("
1,Not as described,"The description says ""Item Package Quantity 6"" but there was only one. I'm extremely angry. As if I'd pay $12.95 for one!"
5,Great Insight into the Evolving English Language,"Adrian Room tells us that there are 11 reasons why a word will change its meaning - but mainly words change as a result of transfers, weakening, adjustment and abstraction. Thus, in the 13th century, a ""knave girl"" was a ""boy"", and girl simply meant child. Still in the 13th century, an ""inn"" was a person's home, and ""with"" (as in ""with a friend"") meant ""against"". We discover that ""lingerie"" was any clothing made out of linen, ""list"" was a band or strip of material, and a ""pupil"" was an orphan child. Room has collected about 1,300 common words that have changed meaning, and where possible he attempts to explain why the change occurred. The book includes illustrative historical quotes and traces the history of a word to its present day. Politically correct language, it seems, has been with us for centuries. A wordsmith's delight."
5,Great costume for my 9 year old :),My daughter loved it :) perfect and true to size!!!!!!!!! the only thing that I had to adjust was the head band. It just woulnd stay on but other than that perfect
3,small... cute but ill fitted,it was SO adorable on my daughter but it was very small. in fact though it fit her just fine the skirt was WAY too short to look appropriate for a child. She only tried it on and never wore it again.
1,very poorly made,The quality of the material was awful. We had not even made it out the door before the costume had giants rips at the seams. The stitiching that connects the velvet material to the slicker material ripped right through the velvet rendering almost all of the seams useless.
4,Nice quality,Bought this for my 9 year old for Halloween. She wears a 10-12 normally. I was impressed with the quality of the outfit- the material is not thin like most costumes you find these days. I did have to extend the head piece with a safety pin. My only complaint was the boots kept sliding down and had to safety pin them TIGHTLY to keep them from sliding down. She looked beautiful.
3,Wonder Woman costume size medium,"The Wonder Woman costume was a medium for our 6 yr old grand daughter. The dress was a good fit, the leggings were way to big, but I don't think a small would have fit. We had to keep fixing the leggings. Still it will be able to be worn again."
3,Great Costume!,"For a constant-use costume, my preference would have been the old Underoos superhero-based underwear and undershirt set, which is no longer offered in superhero-style, just Spongebob & Dora, or sexy, ""retro"" underoos for ladies. Therefore, this costume was a winner by default of being the only choice. I did like the fact that it was a skirted costume. The boot cover & crown straps broke within a week of play, but the elastic was easily replaced. Still miss underoos though..."
1,Sadly just returned it,"I ordered this item for my 4 y/o daughter who loves Wonder Woman. When it arrived it looked great and my daughter loved it. However within a day or two the material came away from the seam where the skirt and tunic meet, the belt fell apart, the seam at the back of the neck came apart, and the paint/finish on the tiara was coming off. It was not too small for her (a little big in fact) nor did she play ""roughly"" while wearing it.If you are a good sewer the seam issues are possibly fixable but its a shame that the costume is so poorly made to begin with. We decided to return it for a refund because we afraid that the replacement would be just as bad."
3,adorable but cheap,"My 3 year old daughter really wanted this costume for Halloween. She looks absolutely adorable in it! The problem is that it is cheaply made (aren't all Halloween costumes though). The threads were already unraveling before she tried it on. Hopefully it will make it til Halloween! FYI, the boot covers do not look like the material shown in the picture. The material is more like velvet/felt."
1,Terrible Quality,"This costume is extremely cute. Bought for my 4 year old daughter to attend a super hero party. Took out of package shortly after receiving to try on. I dressed her. The top white part of boot cover ripped completely off while putting on without shoes, second one also ripped about an inch long. We decided not to wear the boot covers for party next day. At the party, within two hours, half of the star on the head band was peeling off, there was a small hole in the shoulder area and a 2 1/2 inch rip in the seam in the waist. It is extremely annoying to pay $25+ for a product which did not even last through a 3 hour birthday party. I will never purchase this brand again."
2,Not a Good Quality!,"Not a Good Quality!. My daughter used this in our home for some days for play with her daughter and the color gone.... Is beautiful, but with not a good quality!"
1,Terrible quality causes big tears!,Just received this item. My daughter was sooooo excited. No sooner has she put it on all runs appeared in the skirt. The quality of it is terrible. She is in floods of tears cause I've got to send it back!!!!!!!!!
3,Very fun but won't last,"I purchased this as a holloween costume. After my daughter wore it just once, I realized the fabric tore away from the chest emblem and the red fabric also tore away from the blue star ""fabric"" on the bottom. It appears the stitches themselves have compromised the red fabric. Making it seam like it's partially cut...like a perferation.I had to repair more than 12"" of seams just to get it ready for Holloween night. Very annoying! I'd return it if my daughter was not so in love with it already...she begged me to keep it so I'm sure I will be stitching it again."
4,Super cute,My daughter loves this costume. She wears a 3t-4t and this costume fits perfectly. As stated by the other reviewers the headband is too small and the boot covers are too big but they are not key parts of the costume for my daughter.
4,Nice product,"We liked it a lot. The kids love it too. The armbands are too big for the tiny arms, so I had sewed them in some. The velcro for the boots also too loose on the shoes, a little sewing solved the problem. Overall, it's a great costume."
1,SIZES ARE NOT CORRECT,"This was NOT SIZE APPPORPRIATE ..I tried the same costume on ,my child @ the store ...Ordered it on here it way toooo small!!!! She is a small petite child..The sizing IS WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!VERY DISSAPOINTED!!!!!now Halowee is tomorrow & I HAVE TO BUY LEGGINGS TO MATCH THIS OUTFIT!!!SO HER REAR DOES'NT SHOW!!!!!!!"
3,Wonder Woman Costume - update the sizing charts!!,I am currently ordering my 3rd size of this costume. The quality seems to be good and as expected but the size chart and information on the site are very confusing. The small is suppose to be 4-6 and it doesn't cover her bottom (closer to 2T). The site indicates that it is recommended for 4-5 yr olds so I ordered the large and it is an 8-10. The size chart says the Large is 6X. So I finally ordered the medium and it's yet to come in...here's hoping. Also why is the Medium $4 more?
2,"Great idea, HORRIBLY HIDEOUS quality","Ug. This is my least favorite kind of kid-related purchase: The quality is so low there are literally threads hanging off everywhere, but the kids love it so much it's not worth sending it back to make a point. This costume could be very cute. The sparkly cape and skirt are just the right amount of sparkly without looking cheap and the boot covers are pretty realistic looking.BUT. BUT. BUT. The quality is past horrible. Right out of the package, here were threads hanging from every place where the person who sewed the costume had to stop and start sewing. The boot covers have whole sections, several inches long, that were separating when we took it out of the package.I really don't ask for a lot from a Halloween costume. I understand they might fall apart in the wash and they might be made of the cheapest fabric ever synthesized. But the in-your-face shoddiness of this costume really irritates me."
2,Shoddily made,"This costume was very poorly made. Besides cheap material, which we expected, it wasn't even well assembled. The seams didn't match, there were holes in the boot covers, most of the pieces were overly large for the age group, and the star smeared off of the crown before she had worn it for 5 minutes. She did still look like she was wearing a Wonderwoman costume from a distance, and she was happy, but I was very disappointed in the quality and won't purchase from this manufacturer again."
5,"It looks great, you get what you pay for, don't expect a lot at this price.",It looks just like the picture and my little girl loves it. I don't expect it to last a long time but who would for what you pay for it? She has run around in it today and it still looks good to go for Halloween. Anything past that is just bonus before it falls apart. This full costume costs less than a pair of jeans so I can't complain.
3,"fun costume, but funky fitting","I bought this for a 4 year old. The gold belt and boot covers are way too big and the headband is way too small. Good thing I'm handy with a needle and thread. Despite the oddities of it, my daughter wants to wear it every other day. Now she just needs an invisible airplane:)"

5,Awesome Twilley Music,"I am so happy Mr. Twilley is Back Again. ""Have a Twilley Christmas"" is amazing I am decorating my house early this year. ""Christmas Love"" is wonderful ""Christmas with the Martians"" is rockin' with the Twilley sound I grew up with.Thanks SO Much...AllisonNYC"
5,Great Tool,"Purchased this when I was removing a hard wood floor and wanted to salvage some of the flooring. In addition, I used it very effectively, to cut off nails that misfired when putting down a hard wood floor in another room. While some work is required, it worked very well. Would recommend that you twist slightly when cutting and let the tool do the work!"
4,Intrigued - One finds himself in the vortex of Gods purpose!,God has oviously shared his secret with John Bevere. This is a must read throughout the body of Christ. The fear of the Lord is a call to the Church to deal with it's whitchcraft. It addresses the need for the servants of the Lord to sit in his council. It is only then that we can effectively - disciple the nations.
5,Amazing,This book is a must read for those who want to get closer to God.Life changing for me.I love all John Bevere books
2,"Some good ideas, but not a good biblical study of the topic","Bevere definitely has some good things to say, but he seems to be distracted by other themes that prevent the book from really being a helpful treatment on the fear of God. The title would lead you to assume that the book is about the fear of the Lord, but it is really at best a 'hit and miss' treatment of the subject."
4,A great book,I have found this book to be a great book in several ways. It sure has helped me to see that as we live in todays world we need to have more of a godly fear of God in our lives.
1,Fear based theology at its worst!!!,"The title of this book says it alone. I don't even have to criticize this book any futher than I already have because I suspect most people aren't fearful enough to actually take seriously what Mr.Bevere has to say. To any evangelist christian who wonders why so many people are turning to a new ideal of What God is, That is unconditional love, not Fear!! Than look no furter than the title of this book!!!"
5,awesome life changing book!,this is a really great book if you are hungry to learn more about the fear of the Lord. i think the whole american church needs to read this book. its really awesome and eye opening!
3,"Wholesome fear covered here, not morbid","Great book to ""ground"" you on wholesome fear of the Lord. Recommended on Joyce Meyer broadcast and I emjoyed reading it."
4,"Great read, Great experience & New revelation",The Fear of the Lord is blessing me tremendously. I am looking at God with a whole new reverence and my worship is increasing greatly. A must read
5,Most needed message for the church today!,I've never read a book more compelling! It made me re-evaluate how I feel about the God that I serve. He is shown here for who He really is! And my heart is filled with more JOY than ever! Does it seem a contradiction? Read it for yourself and see what I mean!
5,Blessings come to those who fear the Lord!,"In the book John takes you through the entire Bible (Old and New Testament) to show those who had an intimate relationship with the Lord and how they ""feared"" the Lord. It has caused me to pray for God to teach me to fear him. I understand that fearing God is separating ourselves from evil. When we fear God we draw close to God, we are not afraid!"
3,Inferior Rock Hudson Western,"Although Rock Hudson is best known for his romantic comedies, he did make a number of Westerns, a number made before he was a big star.The Lawless Breed has all the makings of a great Western - a great director in Raoul Walsh, a great cast, including Hudson, Julie Adams, John McIntire, Dennis Weaver, Hugh O'Brian, and Lee Van Cleef, and a great story - the true story of John Wesley Hardin, one of the Wild West's most notorious gunmen. But this Western is disappointing. Hudson could seem very uncomfortable in some of his Western, and in The Lawless Breed, he does not come off as believable as Hardin, which sabotages the rest of the movie.The Lawless Breed isn't a horrible movie, but it would have been even better if the leading man was better suited for the movie."
5,All Expectations Met,These grips are consistent with the exceptional quality I have come to expect from Pachmayr. I bought them for my Smith & Wesson Model 640 .357 Magnum. Their compact design makes them ideal for concealed carry. They are noticably slimmer than the factory grips that came with the revolver and they make for a more comfortable pocket or inside-the-pants carry. I am very satisfied with my purchase.
3,Young,"This story can be likeable. A sweet, too-tall girl with the avarage problem of a new life. The downsides? It's so dull!Katie complains on and on in her journal, when she isn't facing any real problems. She's being a spoiled brat about returning to New York, and has eyes for only herself. Katie sounds more like a four-year-old than eleven."
1,Seven Month Glitch,"This television performed admirably for 7 months. Great picture and good sound. Now...it begins to ""whistle"" more and more loudly after being on for one hour. It needs to be shut off, allowed to rest, then can be used for another short while. After 90 days any labor must be paid for out of one's own pocket...and any tv repair person will charge at least $80 to just come take a look...You do get what you pay for; I got a nice tv for $14 a month for 7 months! If you can afford something a little better it is worth getting something that is better quality."
5,"Great TV, had it 2 yrs and still runs great","Ive had this TV for 2 yrs now. Im a college student and bought it coz it was very reasonably priced (Id compared many prices at the time), and also it was a good size. 19"" is big enough for home use, and certainly big enough for a dorm room. Its a simple tv, and has audio, video, and earphone jacks. The picture quality is good. The tv has given me no problems at all in these 2 yrs. Its been subject to rough use, such as regular shifting from one dorm to another every semester, and having friends come over and use it too and it is still running fine. Also its easy to use, menu systems navigable easily with remote control. So overall I think it is a great product, and I am very glad I bought it. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a low cost but good quality tv."
1,you get even less than what you pay for!,"mono sound (how do you get you 3-prong RCA cables from the DVD player to work?)... after about 5 hours of use, the edges all around the screen are a green a purple hue for a few inches inward! Thanks God for Amazon.com customer service, we're sending it back and paying almnost twice as much for a tv 10x better..."
3,amazing,great read very in depth about how one white guy lived his life in the game on a totally different level
2,Wild Ride in the City by the Bay,Elmore Leonard rules the Florida Coast; Bob Armstrong nails San Francisco!
4,Cool Concoctions in a Calabash,"The title pretty much says it all. This is a veritably embroidered calabash of poetry stewing in sweet afrobeat concoctions; a stunning debut and an indication of great things to come. Calabash Vol. 1 finds Ikwunga delivering a set of fresh verses on longstanding concerns. Much of the material here is as long on poetry as it is on titilating music, a provocative mix of pedestrian pidgin and sound that most people will be hearing for the first time. Ikwunga's raw delivery and Dele Sosimi's minimalist Afro-Chill constructions make this a winning disc."
1,Not impressed with the zippers,"I really wanted to like these bags -- and at first glance, they looked perfect. However, within minutes of stuffing them with various things from my tool bag (opening and closing 3-4 times each), two of the zippers failed.Two words for you McGuire: YKK Zippers."
2,Zippers are garbage,"Have had these bags for a couple months now, and the zippers on one of the three bags is already inop, and the zipper on another bag does not function well. While the bags are inexpensive, I would look for a different set with better zippers."
1,Not Cotton Canvas!!!!,"I had purchased some of these bags in the past, local store switched to a nylon version, instead of the cotton canvas. I was happy to find these online, until they arrived and are now made from cheap nylon material, and not the cotton canvas as advertised.Don't buy these if you are expecting cotton canvas!"
3,Good and Bad,"I use these bags for completely different purposes. I use the medium bag as a ""fanny"" pack when i commute to work on my bike. It fits my wallet, phone (Samsung Galaxy S3), and a multiuse bike tool. They all fit perfectly and the zipper closes easily. I use the smallest bag at work to carry a few screwdrivers and hand tools. The material of the bag does not stand up to the sharp edges of the screwdrivers (Phillips and flathead). They poke through the bag and i have to readjust the tools to keep them inside.These bags are good for light duty assignments. Anything more may leave you less than happy."
5,Threesome,"This threesome is great, I love these little storage bags, there good for wire nuts, screws & small parts and they hook together."
4,Works well,"Good add on for tool bag. Holds miscellaneous items conveniently and keeps things organized. If your tool bag is small, these make an easy addition for extra space."
5,Very useful,"I bought these to replace the plastic case my set kets originally came in, that had worn out. I love these. They are sturdy, and much better than the original plastic case. Zipper open and closed, and nothing falls out. I put them on my wish list for the family to get me more...I will think of ways to put them to use."
3,There are ok,Ok bags. I guess it depends and what you are using it for. On one if them the sipper doesn't go all the way. Again like i said there are ok.
3,Easy But Not Over the Top,"This CD works great as background music at among gatherings of cognoscenti . It's not so great for highly attentive, critical listening."
1,Pay for two - get one,"Only got one when I paid for two. Only option Amazon gives you is to return for replacement. Seems reasonable except when you consider the cost of the item vs. cost of return shipping. The one I got seems OK but I'm ticked off I only got one. I posted a complaint on the ""package condition"" option, with a picture of the unopened package with only one item included in the ""set of two"" But no response from Amazon.Considering all the things I bought for Christmas from Amazon, I guess I should be happy this was the only screw up, but I'm still ticked off."
1,Beer Opener,"The product I received is not what was advertised or what I expected. The openers I received are not stainless steel as depicted in the photo. They are steel painted black. Yes, they will open a bottle, but I would not recommend this product or the seller."
4,nice opener but ...,The openers were taped together when I received them and the tape was very hard to get off and left a lot of residue. I put the openers in the dishwasher hoping to remove and or soften the residue and was unexpectedly surprised to find a lot of rust spots on the openers.
4,everything fine,I haven't used this yet - they were bought for gifts but they seemed fine - just what I thought they would be
3,The Most Relaxing Game Ever,"This game is beautiful and awesome. The battles are very realistic looking, and the physics seem very correct. This game does everything right, except for one fatal flaw. Everything is extremely soothing and relaxing. From the announcers super calm soothing voice, to the fact that it takes a good five minutes to have a fighter squadron fly across the map (much less a frigate). Anyway I have fallen asleep playing this game multiple times. Other than that Its a great game."
5,Not in our name,"Haden is always worth hearing, and Not in our Name is no exception. It also celebrates a fine organization and a fine concept regarding the use of a tragedy for political gain and excuses."
1,Hurt my scalp,Tis cause severe itching and dandruff in my scalp I threw the rest away thankful Lord I never knew I would have to go through all the hassle with the itching and flaking due to this perm don't use it
5,wow love ss music,"i was so surprised tonight- was watching a and e- they did a bio on steven-what a wonderful surprise, he sings and plays musici'm buying everything he has out.just bought- girl its alright- love his music, he has been my fav actor for a while, now this added bonus. thanks steven!!"
4,Better than you may think,"This is a very well produced CD. I would not have bought this CD if I hadn't listened to it first. Mr. Seagal sings in a natural, uncontrived voice. The arrangements and production quality all contribute to a very good blues CD. Give it a listen."
3,MOJO PRIEST...NOT BAD!,"ON THE WHOLE MOJO PRIEST IS NOT A BAD CD. SEAGAL'S VOCALS AREN'T BAD....FOR AN ACTOR. I'VE HEARD WORSE BY OTHER ACTOR/SINGERS. (CHECK OUT SAMUEL L. JACKSON ON THE ""BLACK SNAKE MOAN"" SOUNDTRACK CD.) SEAGAL'S GUITAR SOLO ON ""BBQ"" IS PRETTY GOOD. I WAS IMPRESSED. THE CD HAS SOME REAL, DYED-IN THE-WOOL BLUES ARTISTS ON IT TOO. ""MOJO""S BAND MEMBERS ARE ALL CHI-TOWN BOYS. SO,IN CONCLUSION, YEAH, YOU GOOD, SEAGAL....BUT DON'T QUIT YOUR DAY JOB YET....WHUPPIN VILLIAN'S BUTTS IS STILL YOUR REAL GIG. JERSEY SLIM"
1,unhappy customer,"I am un happy cotumer because someone returned my items, and i love this guy so it wasent me....i want them sent bk"
1,HAHAHHAHAHA~~!!,"I would buy this just so I could show people the song titles & they could continue to laugh with me about how absolutely ridiculous this guy is as both a singer (or wannabe I should say) AND an actor. He's no good all around! LOL...although he is good for some laughs. Thank you Stevie, you're such a comedian!"
4,Suprise! - He is actually very good!,"I purchased this CD after attending Seagal's blues concert in Portland, Oregon, USA. Like many of his other fans, I originally went because I was a big fan of his movies. I own the ""Crystal Cave"" CD, so I knew that Mr. Seagal had some talent, but I went in with some reserved expectations.Needless to say, his live performance was GREAT!! Mr. Seagal has surrounded himself with a great band full of names familliar to the Blues enthusiast (such as Bernard Allison, son of legend Luther Allision). His stage performance was lively and full of energy and I was very impressed with his voice and ""chops"" on the guitar.His stage show consisted of a combination of material from this CD as well as a couple of Blues standards, all very well done. I can actuall say that of the many blues concerts that I have seen, this was one of the better. I was pleasantly suprised!"
4,"Best Value, Best Bang for the buck","This weight bench has the most features you can get for the price. It's not without its flaws: The columns holding up the benchpress bar are extremely close together, and you will have to grab the bar from outside the columns. That's fine if you have wide shoulders and reach, but can be a little awkward when you get into different positions. Still, I got used to it. Also, the curl bar included in this kit is *NOT* olympic size, and made of really flimsy lightweight tubing.But you really can't ask for more: it's compact, which is great for a small apartment; it's *VERY sturdy, and holds heavy weights; the curl bar support is fairly comfortable; it has *FOUR* incline positions; and most importantly, it's *CHEAP*.I couldn't find a better deal anywhere."
4,Great series - drifted a little this season,"Wasn't really interested in the wives backstory...Using the wives almost touched ""the jumping of the shark""Saved only by the failure to return the following season."
4,Excellent,Just plays. Packaging was clean and new. Arrived on time. No scratches on DVD. What more can I say? Its just a DVD!
5,CBS ... what are they thinking?,The unit is the only CBS series I follow and all my freinds were so dissapointed when they decide to kill the switch! Well! another stupid decision CBS is doing ! Well!all my freinds and myself will stop watching CBS for doing such actions !
4,Sine Pari,"I've seen folks compare realism between ""24"" and ""The Unit"". This is a mistake. The First two seasons of the Unit were loosely based on actual situations that are still discussed in SOF lore. I can't say the same for Season 3. Nor can I account for Haney's involvement (or lack of... )in Season 3. I will watch Season 4 to see if redemption is attained. And ""24"" is simply fictitious Hollywood imagination, which seems to resonate better with the general public. Truth is stranger than fiction."
3,video on demand,This was a great episode from The Unit series. To be able to rent episodes through my Tivo is just a great thing!
1,Do NOT buy this!!!!!!,"It was not copied correctly. Disk 5 is NOT watchable - regardless of platform - DVD, computer, game station - you will not be able to watch ONE episode!!! Wait until the second generation DVD is released!!!! They made me give it at least one star to post, but it deserves ZERO stars - good show, but THE DVD IS NOT WATCHABLE!!!!!!!!!"
1,Simply the best !,My entire family absolutely loved this series and we are just SICKthat CBS chose to cancel it. I now have the entire collection and will enjoy watching over and over.
4,Where is Season 5?,"Show was cacelled after this season, wish there was a season 5 with a new CO of the Unit. Good last season, definite 4 stars."
5,So bummed it was canceled!,"What were they thinking by canceling this show?? We were addicted to it and the characters in it, especially those inside the Unit. Fantastic acting, my two favorites were Max Martini and Michael Irby. There are so many mindless shows on TV and they go and cancel a solid one like this? It makes no sense. If CBS can do this, don't watch new series on their network anymore because who is to say they won't yank the rug out on those too just when you are getting into it. The actors who made this show as awesome as it was and the audience deserved more.5 stars for this awesome show, below 0 stars for CBS."
5,best tv show in a log time,"Best TV show in a log time only conpare with Soldier Of Fortune Inc.,SOF: Special Ops Force, Tour of dutyS.W.A.T. by the way amazon.com can you get that TV show (Soldier Of Fortune Inc)"
5,The Unit,"Fantastic show wish they had made alot more seasons I have all from season 1 to 4 watched many times, If you like stories of the British SAS then you will love this show"
5,Remaster of Kaya well worth a new listen,"Bob Marley's 1978 release ""Kaya"" has benefited from a new remastering that is as exquisite as the sweet songs that make up this collection.Listening to the keyboards reverb between left and right channel on such timeless songs as ""Is This Love"" or ""Sun is Shining"" while a chorus of percussion softly pulsates back and forth makes this one of the very finest collections from Bob Marley and the Wailers. Junior Murvin's subtle guitar licks highlight turnarounds in each song. The vocal mixes are among the best ever from Bob abd the I Threes.The remaster of this CD is exactly what one would expect with the instruments clearer, the bass more powerful, the mix given a lively feel that brings you closer to the source than ever before. An already great collection that has been given a lift, it's worth noting these mellow riffs."
4,great backpack,"I got this backpack mainly for mountain biking, but I also use it for hiking,camping, as a gym bag, and more. I love the top pocket for sunglasses. The straps are sturdy and comfortable, and the attached cell holder is perfect. Would definitly recommend"
4,A Compelling Photo Book,"Anyone who ever photographed dark-skinned subjects will admire how good Ken Light handles a camera. As good as the photography is, it is shocking to see this level of poverty in America. But Light's subjects are presented with dignity and beauty. The tension in the subject's inner strength and their awful surroundings is memorable."
5,Gorgous gift set,Bought at $99 on amazon a year ago as christmas gift for a friend at $99. Very beautiful.
2,deceiving!,"ok, i haven't even heard this cd--i just watched the movie and the 2 of the songs that intrigued me (TUCKER's ""don't stop..."" and ST GERMAIN's ""so flute"") aren't on the soundtrack...ok, that happens sometimes but what irks me is the spate of recent soundtracks that say ""music from and INSPIRED BY""--what is THAT about?? people wanna buy the cd's for songs they heard in the film, don't they? first there was the controversy of songs used in trailers not showing up in the film or on the cd, and now THIS! but the thing is, this particular cd doesn't even warn u that alot of these tunes have nothing to do with the movie! it's just stupid, if u ask me....i don't understand it...."
3,LOVIN THE NEW VIBE,I AM REALLY IMPRESSED WITH THE VARIATION OF MUSIC ON THIS CD. CHRISTINA MILLIAN HAS A GREAT TRACK ON THE NEW SOUNDTRACK. BUT I AM REALLY LOVING THE MERCEDES BENZ TRACK BY SAY YES. THIS SONG HAS A MIX OF R&B AND OLD SCHOOL ROCK. THE SINGING IS INCREDIBLE AND I HOPE I GET TO HERE MORE OF THESE GUYS. I CAN'T WAIT TO HERE MORE FROM BOTH ARTISTS!
1,Self-service,"I found the album monotonous and self serving with subdued lyrics and unimaginative musical paths. I had hoped for a great deal more. The entire genre of ""Christian Rock"" is too loaded down with its agenda to be able to truly touch the soul with music itself, the form of which even Sartre conceded points to something in a higher realm of form divorced from the world of becoming. This album misses this entirely."
2,Not what I was hoping for! BCM,"Diverse Druids: The Origin of All Religions was not what I was expecting. Though this book has lots of information about Druids and many other historic societies, I was very disappointed with this plodding read. I was overwhelmed with quotes, sightings and information from more then 160 different sources. This book had a definite `conspiracy theory' feel to it and in my opinion, was choppy and disjointed. As a reader, I would have benefited greatly from an index and glossary of some kind.I did enjoy some of the unique tidbits of information scattered throughout.I would much rather read from select books which the author has sited and have received more factual information on specific subjects, instead of conjecture and the authors interpretative-moulding of the facts.This book may appeal to those interested in ancient religious sects and secret societies.(3 out of 10 Diamonds) - It was...okay2008-2009 Bobbie Crawford-McCoy (Book Reviews By Bobbie).All rights reserved."
2,Dr Scholls,Not as comfortable as I thought they would be. Not as nice looking as I thought they would be.
5,Dr Scholl's Ranger bot,I am thrilled with these boots. Very well constructed and very comfortable. Look good too.
2,"Good deal, not what it seems","for the price, it was a good deal. However, what they don't tell you is the tongue is attached to the boot. So when I went to tie them, I had about an inch and a half space between my leg and the boot. Rather uncomfortable to walk in when they feel like wading boots."
3,Good sturdy shoes but not too practical,"The quality is not too bad, and it doesn't look cheap. Given the special sale price that I have paid, I can't complain. But I find it not very practical. The materials are hard and so it is not very flexible when you walk on it. I can use it only when I don't have to drive. And so I have used it only twice since I bought it one month ago. Maybe, if I use it more, it will become more flexible? I don't know?? That I can tell you after next winter because now it is too warm to use it!"
2,Living with a stroke,"Me and my husband read this book together and we did find some parts of it very helpful, but is is lacking in reality the depression and guilt, along with the sorrow that a person feels when they have suffered a stroke. My husband had a stroke at 40, even thou my husbands stroke was not as severe as Pauls, he made alot of his recovering years sound like a walk in the park."
4,Harmonicists enjoy,"This is a nice collection of some tunes with tasty blues harmonica licks from the 1950s and 60s. There are a few tunes here by some undistinguished ""squawkers"" (my word for mediocre harmonica players), but they're in the minority. For the hardcore fans of blues harp, there are a few unreleased tunes here by the master, Sonny Boy Williamson II along with other greats as Jr. Wells, Snooky Pryor and Sonny Terry, but the revelation here comes in two tunes by the little-known Louis Meyers, who really made his mouth organ talk. This collection, like Rhino's excellent volumes on Blues Harmonica, will make Blues fans jump for joy and harmonicists go back to the woodshed to practice some more."
5,HP 74XL,"I used this to refill my HP 74XL black ink cartridges. I sat them on a disposable plate with a paper towel beneath the cartridge as a precaution. There was a little bit of bleed through onto the paper towels, but not a mess. The syringe is easy to load, easy to clean. The box did not have instructions for my cartridge but a super fast internet search gave me all the info I needed. The print quality is fine, no smudging. I plan to buy more."
4,One of his best.,"If you are thinking of ordering this book because you have liked other books by Lionel Davidson then I recommend you go ahead - this is one of his best, in my opinion, with a plot which is even more beautifully crafted than usual."
5,Excellent.,"Boris Tchaikovsky is an unsung hero of the russian music of the XXth century. While Alfred Schnittke, Edison Denisov, Arvo Part, Valentin Silvestrov and Sofia Gubaidulina have enjoyed a wide recognition around the world, Tchaikovsky remained almost unknown for wider audiences in the west. It's a great pity because his music is very good.Fortunately times change and now you can find many CDs with his wonderful music on amazon to purchase. Together with this one his NAXOS editions are very recommended and Chamber Symphony edited on HYPERION."
5,The BEST!!,These Luden's are SO HARD to find in the stores. No one in the Twin Cities metro area carry them. I am SO relieved to find them online. I am buying two boxes of them so I have them on hand. They taste great and really help with my sore throats and dry mouth. They are so soothing. Try them out!
5,Ludens Menthol throat drops,It's so hard to find the Ludens menthol drops - I bought before and I'll buy again. I hope that they will continue to sell them!
4,"Shine On Through, Elton!","""A Single Man"" may not be Elton John's best album, but it ranks right up there with his classic albums from the early seventies. Here, EJ experiments with certain musical styles ranging from the jazz-laden ""Big Dipper"" to the 'countrified' ""Georgia"". There's also straight-ahead rock featured in ""I Don't Care"" and ""Part-Time Love"", an AM Top-40 radio staple in 1978. The pyrotechnical, yet powerful ""Madness"" breathes more life into ""A Single Man"", while ""It Ain't Gonna Be Easy"" tends to bring the album down just a melancholic tad. The lovely piano-encompassed instrumental ""Song For Guy"" provides both a sentimental and rousing finish to a stellar, finely crafted album. These are good reasons to add ""A Single Man"" to your CD library."
3,"Good not Elton best,But it has his sounds.","It not one of Elton best, But if you like Elton you well like this one. It is Elton."
4,Shine On Through,"This album was the first album Elton released with less frequent intervals. Being able to write two new hits for the new album, ""Part Time Love"" and ""Song For Guy"", his focus was now on his private life. Still, he remained busy; he his co-producer of ""A Single Man"". It's sort of a down to earth album after the crazy five-year period from 1970-75/76. It was the beginning of the punk era but Elton did a good album. I suggest getting the bonus tracks editon; the song ""Strangers"" are among the best bonus tracks in by knowledge."
3,Meh,"Very informative but not nearly as titillating as I would have thought. I would suggest Poop Culture way above this book. That said, it's good info for writing papers or purely to glean facts from."
1,Tabs rip off,"I have spoken to several people who had the same problem. The tabs just rip off WAAY to easily! WIth a squirmy little one, it is so frustrating to have wind up with the tab in one hand and the baby in the other! Until they get this problem fixed, I will stick to Pampers!"
3,Yea! Utada Hikaru!,"I was so excited when I heard that Utada had a song on this cd, so I had to get the cd just because of her. I really like her song on this cd, maybe not as good as some of her other songs in Japan, but I like it. I highly recommend listening to her other cds (First Love, Distance) if you like her song ""Blow My Whistle"", even if you don't know Japanese. (Most of her songs are done half in english)Other than that I can't say much about this album. I haven't been a much of a fan of American music for about 2 or 3 years. Some of the songs are good some of them are pretty bad..."
1,Awful !,"This album is REALLY bad....much of the music is not even on the movie, and two of the best songs that SHOULD be on the album are not !! (Micheal Jackson : Dont stop till you get enough and P. Diddy : I'll be missing you). Wouldn't reccomend even buying this thing used...mine is going to be used for a coaster....or thrown in the trash."
3,Pretty good: My girl Utada Hikaru iz OFF DA HOOK!,"The Rush Hour 2 soundtrack is good. There are some real good songs on this album...and there are ones that don't even deserve to be heard. Songs such as ""I'm Sorry"", ""No"", ""You Make Me Laugh"", ""Party And Bullsh*t"" are all great. I can't help but nod my head to the beats and feel the music. But, like most CD's, It has it's downside. Tracks such as ""How's It Gonna Be"" and ""Keep It Real"" should not have made it onto the Album. Even ""Area Codes"" got played out.But the one song that made me say ""WOW!"" was Utada Hikaru's ""Blow My Whistle"". This song is produced by The Neptunes and features Foxy Brown. Of course Foxy's raps are tight. But Hikaru's voice flows perfectly on this song. What is so amazing is that Hikaru generated the most discussion on the album, and she's virtually unknown in the U.S. That, to me, shows a bright future in Utada's U.S. career.3.5 STARS"
3,Utada Hikaru saves this album....,"I am not a real big fan of hip-hop, nor am I a fan of american R&B, but I have to say that this albums' only saving grace is Utada Hikaru and her splendid song ""Blow my whistle"". Being a HUGE fan of HIKKI's since her debut, I have come to appreciate her better than U.S. talents and her incredible abilities as a writer. Both of her album's (DISTANCE and First Love) both showcase an artist that, if she were to ""cross-over"" into america, will take it by storm. HIKKI is without a doubt the only reason as to why I own this CD and if you ask me, it's reason enough!"
3,Checkout GNU scientific library (GSL),"I totally agree with another reviewer that the biggest drawback of numerical recipes (NR) is that first you have to buy them to see whether you need it or not afterall. Linux these days is way more user-friendly than it used to be. If you have fedora or ubuntu, get gsl with one lineOn fedora:yum install gsl gsl-develOn ubuntu:sudo apt-get install gsl-bin gsl-ref-htmlThat's it, people! What can be harder!GSL documentation is free online, but you can order a book as well.GNU Scientific Library Reference Manual - 2nd EditionP.S. also GSL library can be used together with c++ code."
2,Stupid conventions applied,"While I have been a big fan of the Numerical Recipes in FORTRAN, I was extremely disapponted in the C version. It adopts the convention of not using zero-based arrays, which is the ANSI-C standard. Instead it employs a series of hacked routines to use 1-based arrays. I personally find it very clumsy."
3,"Numerical Recipes in C -- Handy, but caution warranted","I have used Numerical Recipes in C with generally fairly good results. Nine times out of ten, the methods provided produce the correct results. However in a disturbingly large number of cases, the routines in this book failed to be sufficiently robust. Though in general the methods are handy, the cautious reader should note that the contents of the book have given rise to serious criticism on the net."
3,talk about outdated,"this book was likely a looker back in the day, but its 2007 now. Need to have better details for non ""C""-users. wish i had bought ""Idiots Guide to C""."
5,Very nice book,A must buy for students or researchers who need numerical methods. Comprehensive topics. A good place to start to deeper levels. Online book is good for quick look.
1,disapointed,"the main tubes are not hot galvanized as they appear in the picture, I suspect they will be likely to rust at the cut ends and drilled holes. Returned instantly."
3,NOT WHAT I SPECTED,"I really was specting a concert from Gheorghiu and Alagna, not that they din`t sing wounderfull, but I was specting more singing from them a less from the choures wich by the way remarkble."
1,horrible,Battery life was horrible I don't know how long it was sitting on a shelf. It holds for maybe an hour. I don't think it's the computer.
2,"Not sure if this was OEM, but i paid OEM price",my pc performance monitor says the battery quality and charge capacity is poor. I paid five times(5x) more for this NEW battery than other other advertised campatible batteries because I thought this was an OEM battery. I guess I didn't get what I paid for. Next time I will buy direct from Toshiba.
5,works great,I was very pleased with the great service and the item itself. I would highly recommend this item for anyone looking for a replacement battery for their laptop.
4,toshiba,this product it's good. Only one problem. It's not identical to piece original. It is a little higher. Stay out of the battery space.
2,Short battery life,"I have had this battery for 8 months and it won't hold a charge for more than an hour now, so I have to buy another one. It's cheaper than buying a new computer though."
1,textbook mania@amazon.com,"I waited six weeks for my order that was supposed to be filled within two weeks,and never got my order filled!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Product doesn't say it's Toshiba,"It fits the slot, but the battery doesn't actually say it's a Toshiba. At least the $17.89 replacement product actually says it's not a Toshiba, but this one, ""by Toshiba"" sold by L3Battery at $25.59, ought to say on the product whether the product is from Toshiba or not."
1,"Not OEM, did not charge properly","Purchased this because it said ""Toshiba"" and not ""replacement,"" thinking I was getting genuine Toshiba part. This is misleading, since it is the exact same battery as the one sold on Amazon for half the price, listed as a replacement. They are both generic substitutes for the Toshiba battery. To make matters worse, this battery did not charge up properly, or hold the charge."
1,"RECEIVED AN OFF BRAND BATTERY, NOT A TOSHIBA BRAND AS PICTURED","THE PHOTO AND DESCRIPTION OF THE BATTERY SHOWED A TOSHIBA BRAND, I RECEIVED AN OFF BRAND BATTERY, NOT A TOSHIBA."
3,"Not very good, average power duration","I received a generic battery with no markings that would indicate this was a Toshiba branded battery. Not a big deal. I took one star off because the battery does not get more than 70-80 minutes, at most. Have not timed it with a watch. I remember my Toshiba original unit got a solid two hours. I took off another star because if the battery is below 50-40 percent, sometimes the laptop would power off during boot up. Sooner or later my boot files are going to get corrupted because of this. Scary! Since my laptop is almost 3 years old I am considering making it a permanent desktop PC with the AC adapter always plugged in and the battery removed."
1,"Bad, bad battery",I've had my laptop for several years and the battery finally quit holding a charge. Instead of purchasing a similar type of battery I went with Toshiba. It didn't hold a charge from the beginning. I'm at a loss as to what to do since this was a Toshiba item. Don't buy this.
1,Suppose to be the same battery. NOT even.. Won't even snap solid,I bought this battery that was suppose to be a compatible battery. Well my goodness it wouldn't even snap flush. And it said it was fully charged. NOPE not at all.. Actually wouldn't even take a charge. Heading to Toshiba to buy the right battery. Not worth my time. Hope I get my refund. Sending back to Amazon.. Disappointed...
4,batteries are a girl's best friend,"My old toshiba battery lasted about two years before it began losing its ability to hold a charge, and for Lithium Ion batteries, that's a pretty good life. I think this battery might not last quite that long, but it's got a great discharge on it considering I have a laptop with a large display."
5,Incredibly delightful,"An amazing, brilliant, virtuoso, delightful and magical recording. Elegant and wonderful.Pedro Memelsdorff creates true poetry with his recorders. Andreas Staier plays with inspiration and power.An explosive duo of virtuoso musicians. ¡Thank you, Pedro!Antonia Tejeda Barros, Spain"
1,Do not buy this hose,I was going on vacation and needed 3 new soaker hoses. I could not find locally the length that I needed so thought I would try the internet. I found these and they look like the same as the hoses I bought last year for another area which worked great. I received these two days before we were to leave and all three blew out right where it hooks to the faucet. I had no time to send them back so I superglue and taped them hoping they would hold at least until we got home. No they blew right below the tape. I will never again buy these on line. I will in the future buy something else for soaking the flower beds locally. Warning. Very inferior.
2,Try something else,Bought this to set up a home gym and probably used it 10 times - Just doesn't have the smooth action needed for a good work out. Don't know if it is my assembly job or just the number of pulleys not working together...I will stick with the professional gym equipment!
5,Vampire strippers and a priest in love make for great viewin,"Unlike many of the menagerie of vampire flicks out there, Vamps takes a well-worn genre and gives it new angles to build upon. An intelligent script, well acted, tightly edited, and presented with visual flair, makes Vamps much more than a babes and blood piece. Newcomer Amber Newman is striking, and Paul Morris is a priest that everyone would want in their parrish. The love story is tender, the nudity appropriate, and a kill scene between two of the vamps is as erotic as a cold-blooded murder can be. This is some of the best stuff to come out of the B genre in a long while. When Joe Bob Briggs said ""Check it out"" in his New York Times Press Syndicate column, he was right!"
4,One of the best Vampire Movies in a long time,"This movie hits all the high points. Youve got good, evil, the hero the damsell. The hot vampire mistress, and the always popular usless lackeies.Now as it has been stated yes there is no full nudity in the movie even if it does take place in and around a strip club. But since most people do not enter such establishments most don't know that many cities ban full nudity in places that serve alcohol. In this the movie is closer to real life.But other then that the movie is top notch, the acting is believable the story line flows smoothly. and as an added bonus the music in the movie are written and performed by local Cincinati bands."
2,Not worth the money,"As a huge fan of Lorissa McComas, I was highly disappointed that her appearance was fully clothed. This is a softcore adult movie spoof. Yes the other girls get topless but Lorissa does not. The nudity is nothing to write home about so if your into this for a quick thrill, there are much better options out there."
3,Vampire STRIPPERS!,This is cool! Amber Newman is cute and there's enough nudity to please. Vampire Strippers! Great idea!
1,Please don't........,"""Stay far, far away from this production company."" is the advice of my brother after watching this movie and I could not agree more. Some okay looking babes with lots of skin shown, but besides that a complete waste of time. No gore and little blood and nothing resembling frights. Only get this if you want a low budget movie shot on video with some strip club dancing in it."
5,great passive interface,"This passive direct box also has interface features which make it a great piece of gear to have on hand for almost anyone doing Audiovisual or media related work.The ability to go from RCA or 1/4 inch phone plug to XLR is extremely handy and necessary in the audio world. This box also has 1/8 inch (3.5mm) jacks for mp3 players and the like. It can handle stereo signals, but outputs a mono signal over XLR.Granted, passive boxes have limitations compared to active boxes, but they are still very useful in most situations.I have been using these boxes for over 12 years, and have yet to have one fail. They are solidly built, and just work, day after day.I recommend you keep a few of these around if you do any serious audio work. They can be lifesavers for difficult interface problems, especially in the field with live events where quick fixes are a necessity.And, as always, I find Parts Express great to do business with."
2,Compared to David Von Drehle & Michael Mello's books........,.....this book is not worth reading...unless one wants to read very out-of-date information. The website for the Florida Commission on Capital Cases can provide one with much more reliable and current information.
5,It Will Change Your Life!!,"I never thought of myself as a ""Messie"", I just thought I was just behind on a few things! Sandra Felton in her wonderful writing style makes you want to sing out loud and expect more from yourself and your home. This book is not for you if you want to learn how to clean but it is for you if you want to organize your home and life. Her system on organizing your cleaning and day to day life are quick painless and ultimately change your messie ways forever!"
2,A BIG Disappointment,"Although it was somewhat humorous, I did not find this book to be too helpful at all. Sandra Felton spends (wastes) too much time psychoanalyzing ""why"" someone is ""a messie"" than offering any useful tips. If I wanted to continuously get labeled or take a bunch of stupid personality tests, I'd go to a shrink. I also found it demeaning how she geared the book towards women--as if women are the ONLY people who should be concerned with cleanliness (a responsibility I'm personally not interested in having dumped on me). It's the new millenium, Sandra!!! There are plenty of guys out there who cook and housekeep, too!"
2,Not very good,Why do people who write these kinds of books have to keep mentioning God every five minutes (Yes I do believe in God)but when I want to hear about God I will read my bible.Borrow it from a friend but don't buy it
5,Empowering book,"This is SUCH a good book. It definitely gives practical advice on cleaning your home; but, more importantly, it makes you feel empowered to declutter and to keep it that way. The first copy I read was borrowed. I kept recording notes on a separate piece of paper while I read the borrowed copy. As I neared the end, I felt I had to have my own copy so I could transfer my notes to my personal copy and re-read the book at will! So much of what the author writes is uplifting."
5,Two for One!,"This contains my two favorite books by Sandra Felton - The Messies Manual and the Messie Motivator. How I ever lived without the Messie Motivator, I do not know. It is very encouraging. Get these books - I mean, get this book! :)"
4,One of the top-accessories for budgies,"I ordered two of these for each of my flight cage, and am quite satisfied with them. My only grouse is that the fastener, or the plastic strap assumes a small / medium sized cuttlebone. In India, we get terribly large cuttlebones, and I frequently have to cut it in half to fit this holder, and when I do so, this strap barely manages to hold the cuttlebone in place.However, the utility of this product is in terms of holding the cuttlebone dust (or particles) and to provide a simple way to place cuttlebones."
5,Great Product!,"I've had a lot of luck with cockatiels and parakeets in terms of this item. They love it! In fact, they will even sit on it when they're not eating the cuddle bone. My sun conure doesn't use it as often because he is too big to actually sit on it, but it does work as simply a cuddle bone holder for him."
3,Cool little holder,"This is a cool little cuttlebone holder. My birds don't eat the cuttlebone all that much but this makes it easy to put in and remove. you may want to check with your local Petsmart, though, I found it there for a similar price."
1,product damaged,"The cuttle bone holder arrived damaged with the sides that hold the perch on broken so it could not be used. It cost more to return it than it cost. It was not packed properly. I had order another product and it was thrown in the bottom with nothing around it. I will say that this does not usually happen with amazon and all other business I have been happy with, but this product cost me."
2,"Pic misleading, does not come with cuttlebone","I am giving this a poor review because the picture is misleading, the product does not come with cuttlebone. I ordered for my son's bird and now I need to go back and order the cuttlebone separately."
1,BEWARE and DANGER,"I came home and found one of my parakeets upside down, wedged-in, on the bottom yellow lip, and the blue bar for the bird to stand on, became his TRAP, and she just died after I pulled and pulled (gently) to try to extract her, but she had perished by getting stuck and through the trauma of maybe trying to get un-stuck for a couple hours while I was gone, she had just expired.........I at first thought this gizmo was the answer to my hopes that wires and all the rest wasn't going to do, and that this was the answer.....I found out it is a DEATH TRAP.Sorry to be negative, but I lost a bird because it got caught in the device, so I would rather be truthful than say, it was just an ""unlucky"" event; No, the parakeet is just big or small enough to get TRAPPED, and I would HEARTILY NOT RECOMMEND this device, by this manufacturer!!!!I lost a top-top, wonderful bird because of this parakeet trap.....still MIFFED!"
5,Great Design,"For many years we've struggled with attaching cuttlebones to the cage of our parakeets. Those built in metal prongs just don't cut the mustard. We like our similarly designed Insight feeding dish so much that I decided to get one of these cuttlebone holders. It's terrific.I like that it is easy to attach to the cage, has a built in round perch, and makes the cuttlebone easily accessible for the parakeets. We've never had a problem with cuttlebone mess, and definitely won't know with the thoughtful design of this holder. This holder has been such a success that I may buy another one to use as a millet holder.Not surprisingly this little device was made in China."
1,Bars wobble and drop out,"This looked great in the store but after I installed it, I realized that I should have touched the display. The double bar is very hard to install and even when done well, with exact template spacing, the bars wroll and the lower bar comes out. There is not way to keep that from happening. DO not buy this. The design is poor. You are wasting your money. If you really need a double bar, buy only one that has fixed bars and not ones that have to be inserted into the two end holders. One example of a good double bar is the ""Gatco 4244 24-Inch Latitude II Double Towel Bar, Chrome""."
4,Love This,"Could not find a double towel bar for the Price Pfister Pasadena collection to match everything else I had bought for my daughter's bathroom. Searched the internet and found this towel bar. Though it is stainless steel it is almost a close match to the brushed nickel fixtures I have picked out. The style is close to it also. The only reason why I gave this a 4 star is because after mounting it to the wall you must use a small hex key to tighten it to the wall, which caused some great frustration. Also, no matter how many times you turn the hex key to tighten it, the towel bar still wiggles a little bit on the wall when trying to hang towels."
3,Nice towel bar,The looks are nice but the way the item is mounted is sort of flemsie. Towel bars get a lot of a pull down motion and this over time weekends the mount to the wall.
4,plant breeding,"Fine book, a bit low key and on a 9th -10th grade level but has useful information and details that I have not encountered elsewhere . Somewhat dated but still pertinent."
5,Great trolley,I was pleasantly surprised by how large this bag is (much larger than I expected). The bag was large enough for my sewing machine and had plenty of additional room for accessories. I am very glad that I bought it.
5,NanaLynn,bought as a gift for my daughter for her new sewing machine. She carries it everywhere. Very practical. She loves it.
3,Gotta Have It - Sewing Machine Trolley,"The trolley is a good size and is made of a good material, however the wheels are lacking. I have used it three times and one wheel has already split. I would not buy this product again because without good wheels, it is not usable."
4,Good quality for the money$$$,"Large, well built sewing machine case. Has enough room for all of my supplies. Looks Great! Looks like it will last along time."
2,Not what I expected,This watch looks interesting and unique on a computer screen. When I actually got the item it was just too big for my liking. It is advertised as a sports watch but the size and weight of it make it an impractical sports watch. I returned it immediately. If you're not an above average sized person I don't recommend you purchase it.
4,Nike Men's Hammer Watch customer review,"The Nike Hammer is well designed and finish is excellent. The controls are intuitive. I did not receive a manual with the watch, so there are still some aspects of the watch I have not discovered. The only negative for me is that the band is VERY wide, so it is great for working out and bike riding, and not so great for use with long sleeve shirts. Also the watch case is very thick, so keep in mind that it is awkward to wear with a sportcoat or suitcoat. I like the digital dial, very easy to read. The back light is bright and easy to use as well. For working out and casual wear this is a great watch."
4,Great watch rugged yet comfortable,"I have owned 2 other Nike watches and they have done me well. The industrial/rugged look of the Hammer watch was why I chose it. The watch is large but does not over power your wrist.Pros: Stylish, rugged, easy to use buttons, and the night light is decentCons: Watch sometimes gets stuck under long selves, like some watches if you type while resting wrists on a surface might be uncomfortable.Overall I would recommend this watch to any one who wants a watch that will look good day to day or out on the trails."
2,?? I didn't like this one at all,"I bought this module way back when i'd been DMing all the 'B' and 'X' modules for my group. I think it was probably the worst AD&D module i'd bought (from TSR that is, there are some shockers out there in the 'open gaming licence' world). Basically it's a jungle adventure, with a dungeon. Not too different from X1 the isle of dread. I just thought the module was sloppy. With a lot of effort and thinking the DM could make something out of it, but definitely not for straight up playing. It just consists of numbered encounters and a mediocre map. One of the few that I would not recommend. Sorry."
3,feeling GOD!,"This is one of the most radiantly beautiful CD's on this planet!The genius that was Hildegard of Bingen will stun you with its beauty. She was a truly gifted and divinely inspired individual.When you put this CD on you are literally transported to another place. A place inside of yourself, a place of intense inner peace. You will feel your soul fly with these glorious melodies.You WILL experience the Divine Mother/Father when listening to this CD.And ofcourse, applause must go to the incredible Ensemble SEQUENTIA for bringing this beautiful music to light again after 850 YEARS!Do yourself a favor and purchase this CD, it will make you FEEL GOD in all Her glory & beauty."
1,Hildegarde makes listeners ecstatic,The CD is appropriate for any type of meditation. It is wonderful to listen to while going to sleep. It uplifts the soul and calms the mind. Fabulous.
5,great cd,I have been facinated with Hildegard von Bingen for years and I truly enjoyed this cd of her music. I recommend this cd f you want to explore more of this mideaval visionary
5,Love it!,I would recommend it to anyone searching good spiritual music! Whenever I listen to it I feel uplifted and happy!
5,Ancient Chants,I have had the wonderful opportunity to sing several of Hildegard's works. Hearing these canticles reminded me of how wonderful they are. This is a beautiful recording.
1,Buye beware,"The product promised is of good quality. Alas, there are two major issues with the product and the seller:1. The low price is deceiving. I paid about $6 for two of these and they charged me about $11 for shipping. True, I could have checked on that but I naively trusted that it would be a reasonable cost. After all, these are tiny, light packages worth about $1 in shipping.2. The product pictured is not what the seller delivers. The packaging is different, the Japanese lettering is different and the quality of what the seller sent was of a lesser quality. I realized this after the packages were opened. The seller asked me to send them back on my own expense and when I refused to do so (after all I had already paid $11 _and_ it was they who sent the wrong items) and asked them to cover the cost, they cut off all communications.Thankfully, Amazon acted right in siding with me and refunding me the entire order. Thus: BUYER BEWARE OF THE SELLER - AND THE PRODUCT THEY SEND!"
1,Not as advertised,"These tea bags are not the tea bags pictured in the listing. I've ordered and used the ones in the picture for years. I love them. Very good, paper bags. When these arrived today I realized they are not the same. The labelling on the bag is not the same, and instead of paper they are plastic. I trying to return them."
1,Bait & Switch,"If anybody knows where I can buy the mask shown in THIS PICTURE, please write me and tell me where. I ordered this mask and got one not looking like this at all. I returned it to the Amazon vendor, talked with their customer service, where they said it must have been an old photo, which nobody had changed out. To the best of my knowledge, they still haven't switched it out with the product they sent me. The vendor I used, also sells the product under other company names, so you'll end up getting it from the same warehouse. From that point on I got on the phone and called several more online stores, speaking to the order department, and ask each to get the product in hand and tell me if it matched the photo shown, if so, I'd take it, NONE had it (bait & switch?)."
1,Your not going to get what u order,The mask in the picture shown is Awesome. Too bad it is not the mask you will get. You will get the mask R4239/329 Creature Collector's mask they r also offering for $44.88. But hey I cannot find the above mask anywhere telling me it isn't Fun Shipped Fast fault but Rubies who is senting out the inferior mask to be sold. FSF should remove this mask however because it is not the one you will get.
3,Helps remove stumbling blocks,This book should be used in basic training for prophets. It uncovers some pitfalls that must be avoided in order to move in effective prophetic ministry.
5,Amazing motivational introduction,"An excellent short motivational reading / introductory course material. Starts ground up and uses very simple hands-on examples to demonstrate the fascinating behavior of non-linear dynamic systems (chaos, fractals, etc). Covers most of the basic methodology.The book also has a lot of excellent exercises for reinforcing the material, for different difficulty levels."
4,A Very Good Collection......,"This is one of those that you keep in your car and listen to it over and over. It has some of Mr. Williams' greatest, the only bad side being there just are not enoght songs."
5,Simply the best.,Don is the most underrated country singer of all time in this old cowboy's opinion. He is a class act all around. This album is the epitomy of what Don Williams is all about. I have listened to this CD probably at least 500 times and am not tired of it yet. You will not go wrong with this selection.
4,Feel Good Country Music,This is an excellent collection. I have it on an LP which I can not longer play. I'm looking forward to the CD to hear these songs again after so many years.
3,'n schmoke song wee...,"Marijuana's growing out of Solomon's crypt?Hailie Salassie is the messiah? Or is it Bob Marley? Maybe there are two.Hmmmnnn?The only book I've ever bought,where there is no worthwhile information."
2,poetry,"i have to say one more thing about this book, as it is said in the introduction it's not real interviews, it's just mde by the author, you must know that it is not a ""scientific"" book it's litterature. And in fact the rastafarian movement owe little to the kebra nagast, founders of the movement probably never read the kebra nagast, only heard of it. Please be careful with the link of the Ethiopian coptic church and rastafarians."
3,"""Interesting""","After recieving the book i read it in about a week and a half and as i read it, it wasn't what i expected as i excepted a biblical version of the rastafarian doctrines and beliefs instead i got a book of a story about what is believed to be in the The Kebra Negast from the view point of a narrattor in Jamacia.This is not The Kebra Negast !!!!!"
2,A story with NO pay-off for the reader,"This book was recommended as a NY Times notable book which I trusted. The book reads like the first novel of a very ""sensitive, artistic"" under-grad writing student. There are a lot of pretentious descriptions and the hint at an interesting story but it is entirely unsatisfying and you realize just past the half way mark it's not getting better."
2,I Can't Read this Book,"Thirty years ago when I was in college I had to muddle through difficult books. What does the author REALly mean? Who is the main character supposed to portray? I used to sit in the dorm and dream of the days when I could read what I wanted; for pleasure.I love to read sentences that flow together, about characters that are real and varied, and indulge myself in plots that are interesting yet ones that a chart is not needed to follow.After 120 pages of The Walking Tour I did not know one character, I did not know what the plot was about and had to force myself to concentrate or else be forced to read the same line 4 times to REALly understand it.This book struck me as a college read from freshman year. It was cumbersome. The cover flap was intriguing. That was the only intriguing part. I quite and went on to something else, something that I VERY seldom do."
3,Too Much!,"There are so many interesting threads in this novel,wonderfully mysterious characters,and a compelling fantastical shift from the misty ancient past to the murky near future. However,there are too many threads,so that some are left dangling while others get all tangled leaving the reader wondering just what to make of this very clever but ultimately messy novel."
2,A Laborious Journey,"In my forty plus years of reading critically acclaimed fiction, I have only given up on two books in mid-read. ""The Walking Tour"" was not one of these, although I gave it careful consideration at about page 140. In the end, I found the novel to be an extremely laborious journey to a less than satisfying plot/conclusion; containing characters with whom I never really did empathize. The writing style and use of grammatical person appeared to me to be more ""gimmicky"" and disoriented then creative/innovative. I believe this was Ms. Davis' first novel. I hope her succeeding works prove more rewarding."
4,Reflections on life and vocation,"It is unfortunate that this lovely work will never receive the credit it deserves, because it is not ""one size fits all."" Karl Rahner's prayers, as presented here, are not general devotions, but deep meditations, simply offered but highly intense in their fashion, regarding various aspects of his own life in Christ. It is a wonderful, rather humbling look at the gratitude, awe, and love which this great theologian offered to His God. However, it is not a suitable gift for anyone who is looking only for a book of general devotions, because many chapters relate directly to Rahner's own circumstances."
3,Not Sure,"I own almost all of Amy's workouts. I find her very cool and love her personality. But I'm not sure about this one yet. I wanted to like it, but some of the moves just don't flow where I found myself improvising with memorized Cathe stuff. The music is not too motivating either and when it was about half through I felt a bit bored wanting it to be over. I was looking forward to the med ball intervals, but didn't like them all that much either. I will give it another shot, but I'm rating it only 3 stars. Not that bad, but not great either."
5,One of my favorite workouts!,"I have all of Amy's cardio workouts, and this is one of my favorites! It's definitely a more high-intermediate/advanced workout, but you can certainly modify many of the moves.As with most of Amy's workouts, there is not a lot of breakdown of the moves, so it took me a few times to get each segment of the workout down pat. Now that I know it, I appreciate the fact that the workout moves quickly, without a lot of stopping to break it down. When you're learning it, you might have to be patient and use your rewind button a bit.The music is great, the kick boxing moves are fun, and Amy's great personality shines through!"
3,kickbox is not her strength,Amy Bento is a great instuctor but kickbox is not her strength. I really like her HiLo and her strength is pretty good but her KB does not flow well. Amy moes too fast and without control. Control is a big part of what makes kickbox tough and effective. Just wasn't wowed by this one.
3,I don't really like her as an instructor,"I wasn't that impressed with this kickboxing workout. The workout was just okay, and sometimes a little hard to follow. I don't really like Amy as an instructor; she's kind of annoying and doesn't explain things well, which might make you become lost in the routine."
4,Short but worth the Ride,"I have long looked for an artist that had the ability to capture the spirit of irish/celtic music and combine it with a modern flavor. I have found it! Rant and Roar is great. Great Big Sea offers a little something on this album for everyone, from slow melodies to fast rantings. Though the album lacks a little in length, I am very pleased with the music and talent found in Rant and Roar!"
1,Try the real thing,"Celtic thrash for an American audience. In case we didn't know they were descendents of Irish immigrants they seem to have to remind us in the lyrics of every other song. This music is an embarrassing bastardization of a genre of music thats been going on strong for decades in Ireland, and the UK. If you think you'll like folk-rock and want to try the real thing, I suggest the following for a start:OysterBand, the Waterboys (Fisherman's Blues and Room to Roam album). The Levellers (first three Albums). Five Hand Reel, Runrig, Capercaillie, Dick Gaughan, Shooglenifty. Boys of the Lough. Alister Hulett. Saw Doctors (first three albums), Christy Moore, The Pogues."
4,A cd that will never collect dust on your shelf,"At first, I was leery of buying this cd. I have Clannad cds, but I was looking for music that would make you want to get up and dance, something that would put fire underneath you. Great Big Sea not only established this, but also included many drinking songs and ballads that are truely entertaining. I recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys having a great time. Even though most people here in the U.S. have never heard of Great Big Sea, I couldn't imagine my Celtic cd collection complete without it. It is worth the risk!"
5,It Will Have You Ranting and Roaring,"This young band from Newfoundland treats listeners to a unique blend of rock, pop, folk and traditional Celtic music. Throw in a few maritime tunes and a couple of drinking songs, and this CD is sure to have you dancing and singing along at the top of your lungs."
3,Really?,"I bought this CD because of the reviews - my sound card in my computer isn't working and I wasn't able to listen to the previews. I should have spent my money towards a new sound card. I agree that this band sounds like they would be a fun band to see live, but not worth spending the money for a recorded version. Every other song on the CD is a high-energy, pub song - but interspersed throughout is the bands attempts at ballads that are not very good. If you are looking for, as I was, a fun, irish, pub band CD - try ""Gaelic Storm"" by Gaelic Storm or ""Molinos"" by Paperboys. Two incredible CDs that will have you singing along to every song."
5,That Music in your Head,"The best! You'll be humming and singing and thinking these tunes forever. I dare you to be depressed after hearing this CD even once. The GBS rendition of ""The End of the World as We Know It"" is the tune as it was meant to be."
5,Quite Excellent,"I heard a snippet of Sammartini on the radio and decided to explore further. This is the best of a few CDs of his music I've subsequently purchased. The playing is of high quality. Sammartini is not Bach, but very enjoyable music of the period."
2,Too much repetition spoils a good thing.,"The quality of the cuts are good, and the engineering is excellent given the price. Some cuts are of Spoon at his best, and the discs provide enough of his Joe Turner-type blues, his live performances, and his jazzier sessions to be interesting.The main problem is repetition, not just repetition of songs but actual repetition of the same tracks on different discs. To say the least, this isn't a very carefully thought through compilation on Quadromania's part. They usually do a much better job. Too bad."
3,"RAGED 70'S BOOK STILL GOOD, BUT FALLS SHORT OF OTHERS","With a new introduction, and an interesting disclaimer about the legal advice contained in the text, songwriter Henry Boye has recycled his earlier SELLING THE SONGS YOU WRITE for the contemporary market. It's essentially the same text, with identical chapter headings, motivational at first, then more technical as the book progresses. I thought SELLING THE SONGS YOU WRITE was a great little project in 1975, and it still works today. But as a music business book for today's songwriters, it is eclipsed by contemporary authors such as John Braheny (THE CRAFT AND BUSINESS OF SONGWRITING) or Jason Blume (6 STEPS TO SONGWRITING SUCCESS), who are new-generation practitioners teaching with more detail. Ron Simpson, School of Music, Brigham Young University. Author of MASTERING THE MUSIC BUSINESS."
4,Fun for Our Puppy,"I ordered this so our puppy would not get bored with obedience training. He likes playing with the tube and the jump. I have to hide the tube when not in use. Because it is not very sturdy, our dog may destroy it. I bought this set to use with a single dog. If you are actively training many dogs or a large dog, you will want more durable equipment."
2,overpriced for what you get,The product came and the materials were quite cheaply designed. I think I will order a more advanced set since I want something that will actually hold up with my dogs activities
1,Do NOT waste your money,the only thing in this kit that was useable was the tunnel. The rest of the kit sucks! Do not waste your money
4,Good Starting Place for Beginners,"I have done a lot of dog training but I have never trained in agility before and was looking to teach my dogs something new. I have enjoyed using the tunnel inside during the heat of the summer to train my dogs and give them an activity to do. Once they got the idea, they really enjoyed it. I am eager to try the other equipment outside now that the temperature has cooled. This product could have gotten a higher rating but the instruction manual was terrible. The teaching methods in the training manual go against a dog's natural instinct. I would recommend buying a book or researching the proper way to train for agility than to rely on the instruction manual."
3,cheap,My dog has been doing agility for over a year and we love it!!! Got the starter kit as a gift from a well wisher and at first we were excited. Once we opened it the disappointment set in. This kit was poorly constructed and made very cheaply. My dog ate the weave pole (she has never enjoyed the weaves) and the knocked the hurdle down every time (the wind would knock it down) and the tunnel is not very long. I have since built my own agility course with PVC pipe for the hurdle and weave poles and a tunnel can be made from a heating duct. Directions can be found online.If you have money to burn and a small dog that you want to introduce agility to this may be for you. If you have experience in agility or a bigger dog you may want to invest in more heavy duty equipment.
4,Fun With Dog Agility Set,"I really liked the dog agility starter kit.I have a coonhound.He's got really good at agility.The posts to ancore the jumps and weave poles will sometimes break easily.Also the poles kinda move move arounds alot.For me it's better than no agility course in my back yard.My neibors also enjoy letting their dogs go around the course.My neibors have a boxer and a besenji/sheperd mix.The tunnel and stopwatch are very sturdy compared to to the rest of the corse.Also in the real agility games, it isn't a pause BOX, its a pause TABLE."
4,Great for the price,A great kit for the price. I wish that it would be allowed for the indoors as well. I don't always like to be outside doing tricks with my dog.
4,Perfect for a tiny dog,I don't know that my shepherds would even pay attention to the items in this kit (haven't tried them yet) but it's PERFECT for my tiny Pomeranian. SO glad I found this.
3,Probably for small dogs only.,Well...it was fun while it lasted...but my beagle/coonhound mix pretty much destroyed the equipment in a couple of weekends. (I bought it for when we go camping...to give us something to do at the campsite in the evenings.)I could imagine this working really well if you have dogs that are smaller than 20 lbs. But if you have a medium-sized or large dog...you'd be better off investing a little more money in something that will last...and is properly sized.As a plus...it's VERY portable. Everything folds flat into one small bag.
4,Great Starter Kit,"This is an inexpensive dog agility starter kit for less than $40! It is made cheaply (and the cost savings are handed down so it's not a bad thing) and has four separate activities for the dogs- high jump, tunnel, pause box and weaving poles. The ribbons that come with it are unnecessary for me. For the price, this is a nice kit. The weave poles use little stakes that push into the ground and two of them broke so I could use spares, so this may be one real problem with an inexpensive kit. My dog is 23 pounds so I was a bit surprised that she broke them. I emailed the company with the email address provided in the kit, but it came back undeliverable. Overall, I would recommend this for an inexpensive kit for play. If one is serious about agility training, they may be better off with higher end products."
4,Agility Starter Kit,My dog loved this. For the price it is well worth it. The poles could be more sturdier. I like how small it breaks down to. We take it camping.
5,cute agility set,"I bought this for my daughter (13) and her chihuahua so they can practice for 4H. They have enjoyed it. I know the box shows a larger dog using it, but I would not recommend this for a dog over 20 pounds. It IS the perfect size for a chihuahua to practice some agility moves! When we practiced agility at 4H last night, our chihuahua seemed to be more comfortable with the equipment-even though it was much larger than hers at home."
2,Not Impressed.,"I guess you get what you pay for. I was not satisfied, product was very flimsy. My dogs tore it apart in a couple days. Maybe better used for small dogs?"
3,Great supplement to real agility course training.,Our beagle loves agility training! Can't get enough of the once a week class so we got this starter kit and use it several times a week for practice. Not quite as good as the real equipment but a good (and inexpensive) supplement for three pieces of apparatus of a regular course.
5,You get what you pay for,"It's exactly what it says it it. A starter kit. Not having paid alot I wasn't expecting durable, long lasting equipement. I got the basics to set up a backyard agility course that my dog and I could play with. My girl spooks easily so having a mini tunnel at home that we could practice with made it easier for her to try out the ""real"" one at class. We can also practice what we've learnt when we want to."
3,Not too sturdy,A bit on the cheap side but lots of fun for my daughter and the dog. Recommed only for small size dog as it is not to sturdy.
4,New baby knits,"I am very pleased with the condition of the second hand book. I was beginning to think I would never find a copy to buy for myself, but thankfully it turned up not only quickly, but in pretty good condition."
2,Rope Moulding,I ordered 20 pieces of this rope moulding and some other items from the same seller. The rope moulding is not as good as what I had expected. The edge part is not smooth enough. I need to resand them by myself.
1,Haydn Sonatas with Andreas Staier,"I have never heard a worse peformance of these wonderful sonatas. Staier has rendered his personal touches to the performance and, in so doing, has shown his conceits. Pauses in cadence and other effects make this CD impossible to listen to."
2,Lame and Outdated Book,Don't expect anything useful in regards to learning icon design. This is pretty much a ten year old history lesson on the beginnings of icons.
1,Rip-off website for free tooth whitener,This ad leads you to a rip-off website where you are enrolled in an ongoing program for $79 a month. The terms are not easily visible. I think it should be removed! I filled out a better business bureau complaint.
3,Not to clear for long range,"I have purchased this binocular for antennas alignments purposes, but when we use them we are not able to see very clear with them at long distance object.Best Regards,MA."
2,Too much palaver,"This may be a fine way to relive your concert experience with these cowboys, but if you're looking for music, and something you can listen to over and over, I'd skip this album. Frankly, I don't care if this is their first major label album, nor do I want to hear corny patter for over half the CD. I want the music that made them famous in the first place. I wish I could send this one back."
2,Hardcore Fans Only,"This album is for hardcore Riders in the Sky fans only. It has a few well-sung songs framed with boring humor, self-mockery, and pointless patter. The phrase ""the cowboy way"" never fails to elicit a laugh from their in-studio audience. If YOU think the phrase is hilarious, you should buy this. Otherwise, skip it."
1,Don't waste your money,"If you are looking for a DVD to learn 'How to do documentaries', you are going to be very disappointed, as I was.I bought this DVD based on the information and the opinion of someone else who rated this item. Maybe the rating is accurate for himself, but there is little or no information about making documentaries. It is a simple, and in my opinion not very interesting, story of what Mr. Hoffman had made during his life. Some documentaries in the 60's and 70's about singers, and many commercials for big corporations from 80's.No advice on how to do anything related to serious documentary filmmaking, no comments on how to improve your skills. Just short excerpts from his old documentaries.If you a fan of Mr Hoffman, buy it. But if you want information on how to do your documentary, look somewhere else."
4,Good film,"I was trying to find a film that would be personal and show me how people go about making documentaries because I never went to film school, but I am trying to find my way in the industry. I thought it was very helpful, and fun to watch. I feel like I learned a lot from Mr. Hoffman."
5,Sheer Heaven,"I've used this product for several years and it is wonderful! I love anise and Lip Sheer smells almost good enough to eat. The texture is also nice, smooth and silky, with a touch of cool from the peppermint. Great product!"
1,Back Up Your Data,"I enjoyed the book for its overview of the evolution of consumer and telecommunications electronics. I believe, however that the message of the book could be put into one phrase of ""save and save often"". The book focused mostly on backing up data and keeping the data in the proper and current format. Not much of the apocalyptic doom that the cover and title portrayed, but I suppose a book titled ""back up your data"" wouldn't sell many copies."
1,Executive Summary: Make backups and test them,"The book is rambling and disorganized. The main point is that you need tested backups and a recovery plan. Too bad that's not what the blurbs say.I kept waiting to reach the meat, the info on the social impact of all this disappearing data. The author quotes a few stories and talks about disappearing media and no backup disasters. The new admin with no backups sad story. Yes it happens, no one thinks backups are important until a failure, but that's not what this book is advertised about. You may want to point out a chart or story to a senior manager, but there's little of value here for anyone in the IT business."
3,Coaching Basketball Successfully,"Some chapters aren't relevant however more pictures describing basic moves would be good. It will refer ie. to the Jab Step, but I can not find in the book anything which illustrates what this is. You need to have a fairly good knowledge of basketball before you get this book. All this being said there are still some good tips in there."
5,This Really Is THE Reunion Planner,"After reading this book, ""The Reunion Planner"", I sent them the following email, which I believe tells the most honest review that I could give this book.""Thank you very much for taking the time and energy to create The Reunion Planner book, software, and this web site. I checked out your book from the Bettendorf Public Library. I honestly believe that anyone who tries to plan a very successful reunion without your book is crazy. It has everything you need. I was so impressed that I visited this web site just so I could order the book and the software for myself.""For those of you who have not read this book it covers family reunions, high school reunions, and even military reunions. The Reunion Planner gives you step-by-step instructions on how to plan your reunion. It starts with what you should be doing about one year before the reunion and concludes with the follow-up work after a reunion that will make it easier for you or someone else to plan the next reunion."
4,THE REUNION PLANNER,THIS BOOK PROVIDED ME WITH SOME GREAT IDEAS. I HAD NEVER PLANNED A REUNION BEFORE. THIS BOOK MADE IT VERY EASY. THE SOFTWARE IS GREAT TOO!
3,"Catch the Vines in studio, not in concert","The Vines' unquestionable genius is much more apparent on their studio album ""Highly Evolved"" than it is on any of the live recordings I have heard (plus the concert I attended). This version of ""Mary Jane"" is no different; a mediocre recording by a band that appears to lack the desire to put on a really good show. The layers of dreamy piano and guitar and the lush vocals on the studio recording won't be found here; nor will the excitement and earnestness of what should be found in a live performance make up for what is lacking here.""Highly Evolved"" is my favorite album in ten years, and has had the number one spot in my cd player for ages. The sad truth is, though, that you should go for their studio recordings before their live recordings (one exception: ""Get Free"" on the ""Outathaway"" single). Try their studio cover of ""Ms. Jackson"", also found on another edition of the ""Outtathaway"" single."
3,you get what you pay for,"Scarf was a little shorter than expected, with some small color defects.3 rows of coins, some irregularBut for seven bucks, about half the price of the other scarf I bought, It was a good scarf to practice in."
2,Alright Quality,"Some of the beads and coins have fallen off - and I've only had them for a few weeks. I would recommend getting one that has coins all the way around, as you can see the movement better. They are beautiful. The teal color is actually the color pictured - but is not actually teal and is aqua."
3,good for the price,Buen precio por el producto. Los colores brillantes y preciosos. Muy bueno para las principiantes y las mas pequeñas.
3,Wouldn't buy another,"After only 4 classes, I lost two coins; another two the following week. Sure, I could sew them back on. And, for what I paid I can't complain. But, were I to do it again (and I just did; I bought the Deluxe version and signed up for another 10 classes), I'd have bought a good one from the start."
4,hip scarf,"it was just as it was described as, economy, so i cant complain. i use it in practice so it serves it purpose."
3,Hip Scarf,"Item received quickly and in good condition. It's ok for my very first hip scarf (used to learn bellydance). However the coins come off easily. So, I'd purchase it for short term use only."
5,Hip Scarves,I loved the product! I really had to look to find the flaws. The service was very prompt as well. I will not hesitate to order from this company again. Thanks!
1,An affront to Roy Rogers' name,Poor quality. No logical sequence. Same closing credits used on many shows rather than true ending credits. Waste of money.
5,Great,I had gotten a shower chair from a healthcare equipment store and it had metal legs on it with rubber feet. Evenually the rubber wore off and the chair left rust stains in my shower. I bought one of these chairs and it is great. Will not rust and very supportive. It is worth the money for me and when this one ever breaks down ( which I hope never does ) I will buy another one for sure. I doesn't take up alot of room either.
4,A really good movie; this coming frome someone who hates soccer,"So im not a big fan of the sport, to be honest i just think that it really dumb for a bunch of guys runningaround chasing a ball, kinda of a watse of time...Any how, i was suprised when i saw this movie. The story is good, consisten and touching. Very well played out and i do have to say that Kuno Becker's acting is one of his best yet."
2,not that great,"One major complaint: the bench is very inaccurate. What do I mean by this? After putting it together as carefully as possible, the symmetry is all off. For example, when I go to bench press, the column holding up the bar on the right side is a few inches more forward than the other column. I've tried to fix it, but its just the way the holes and the nuts and bolts line up. This is not a problem with lighter weights, but with heavier weights any lack of accuracy can be painful. It seems that most of the bench is slightly off. Also, the lat attachment is not smooth at all. One of the reasons I bought the bench was because my old bench doesn't have a leg attachment. Turns out, this might be the only thing I use consistently. I might have to use my other bench for other things. I thought I could get rid of my other bench, but now I can't. I do like the decline feature, though. You get what you pay for, I guess"
1,Worst album ever heard,"Well, that is the worst French Rap album i have ever hear, if you can call it ""rap""."
3,An interesting french rapper with groovy sounds.,"Stomy Bugsy is a french rapper, member of the Sector A. This group is very well known in France were millions of people await new songs. If you want to discover french rap, this is a great occasion. (I know what I'm talking about, I'm french! and it's Le Calibre Qu'il te faut.)"
5,Mysterious Discoveries,"This book, for kids 9-12, is an engaging tale of a summer in Germany. Nika and her friend Torsten discover the identity of dinosaur fossils in an archaeological dig, recover evidence that the ancient Romans collected fossils--and they solve the mystery of a secret room in an old inn.Archaeological, paleontological, and historical material is expertly woven into a story that is at once exciting and emotionally complex. Highly recommended!"
3,A nice walk down memory lane.,"I have always loved the sound of the Mills Brothers. Whether 4 brothers, 3 brothers and a Dad, or just a trio, their harmonies and swing style can not be beat. I was blessed to see them in concert in the mid 1970's (when they were probably pushing 70) and they still sounded great. This package contains some of the essential Mills Brothers hits. Check out Opus One if you've never heard it. Backed by a large orchestra it really swings. Paper Doll is also a great work as well. The problem with this package (as with almost any ""greatest hits"" package) is you don't get to see enough of the versitality that they were known for. Also you don't get the early stuff, when they were known to provide their own instument sounds using nothing more than their voices. Overall a good addition to any collection, just don't stop looking for more. There is way too much great Mills Brothers songs still out there."
4,guide to colt memorabilia,"the book was just as advertised. It has a lot of good information in it, just not much of what i was hoping for."
2,Is this the best we can do?,I think the text of the book is fine but I think the drawings are horrific. My apologies to the author but I do not think any women - straight or gay - really look like this and it just doesn't translate to my children at all
4,poor disgruntled fisherman above,I love this product and if you know how to use unlike the above review. you can catch many salmon as I do every year using these beads. happy to share photos to non-believers
1,Very poorly constructed,"Every single one of these four chairs I ordered was defective. I didn't want to hassle with sending allof them back, so we are repainting parts of them and regluing the others but one of them we simply could not get the screws in so are forced to return. Extremely disappointed and shame on this company for obviously not having any integrity about the product.I am editing my review to let readers know that the return process is very laborious. Even after filling out their form, sending a picture of problem and description of unfixable problem, they required me to pay shipping plus they recharged me a 20% restocking fee. I am taking chair to dump, not worth it. Buyer beware!"
4,Nice chair especially for the price,"The chair is sturdy, well made, and easy to assemble. Be aware that it is considerably darker in color than the image shown in Amazon. My only gripe is that the back side of the chair had paint damage due to shipping that I will need to touch up."
5,Great CD and Artist,"Reese is a fresh voice and sound in music. I heard about him through a friend who saw live him in NYC. He was blown away and bought a CD at the show. He loved the CD so much he told me to pick up a copy so we could share it... I thought he was exaggerating, but I'm really glad I bought it. The songs are great, his voice is powerful, soulful, rocking and unique all at once. The sound of the music is great quality and like the title says, eclectic. I highly reccommend it!"
1,disappointed,"I brought this for my 3 years old. She was so disappointed when it came and so am I. It is not much a plastic case with some crayons, markers and some activity pads. It definitely is not worth the money. You can get crayons, markets etc. and the case separately and cost less than that. ..."
2,Just buy a pack of markers ...,"One of the main reasons you would buy this product is because of its' handy carrying case, right? Wrong! The case is extremely hard to open (especially for a young child), and then when you DO get it opened, it comes apart and is virtually impossible to put back together!!!My child got one of these for a birthday present. We saved it as a ""special toy"" to take on a long car trip. Boy, that was a mistake. She cried when she couldn't get it open, then was upset again when the lid broke off. All this for a cheap pack of markers, a little chalk, and some paper. Oh yeah, can't forget the off-brand crayons, too.Don't buy this product. Just buy a coloring book, a pack of markers, and an ice cream cone for your kid. He/she will be much happier."
5,"Lush, hypnotic and calming.","The music of Sainte-Colombe is something of a miracle -- little else like it before or since. This is a respectful album of his music, beautifully played and presented. It's like meditating. If you enjoy this, you'll likely love ""La Folia"" -- [...]"
3,Just OK,"Flimsy Flip out stand on back to hold it in one upright position.Remote is way to large. It appears that they used a remote from a larger Tv and incorporated it into the flat panel use, as observed by the unused area of the remote which could have been for VCR/DVD controls for a different set.Picture is fair and sound almost adequate.Try Magnavox instead if you have the opportunity. Just the stand alone for it will make it a better purchase than the Sylvania."
2,Sylvania LCD TV performance,I was very disappointed with the TV. The picture was very fuzzy. I was unable to improve the picture with any of the on screen adjustments. I returned the unit
2,Help needed on settings,Never have gotten really good settings for my Sylvania 6615LE little TV. Can anyone supply really good ones?
5,Sylvania 6615LE a Steal for the price!,"Great TV for the money, picture is awsome sound is what you would expect from a TV of it's size. I love it, I mounted it on a flip down mount in my kitchen and it is great. Even my wife, who at first gave me business for putting a TV in the kitchen, loves it she watches it more then I do. Most people only complaint is the isze of the remote it is a little large but who cares. If it bugs you that much you can buy a real cheap universal and you are all set."
3,Good small LCD TV for the money,"For around $300 this is a good deal, and probaly the bset small cheap LCD TV you will find. This little TV is now in my kitchen, and the picture quality is pretty good considering it is hooked to my cable and not my satellite, the latter of which has a superior signal. The viewing angle is OK and the darks are a little to light. Now the biggest problems are (1)the remote, it is huge, considering this TV has no major extra features and the remote has only the most basic features why is it so big? I mean it is larger than my Kenwood audio receiver remote and it has proabably 50 buttons, I am going to replace it with a small basic universal remote. (2) The other major ""bad"" with this set is the stand, it is like a picture frame stand so the TV always will have to lean back somewhat, it can't stand up straight like do most LCD TVS and LCD monitors. All in all a good buy though not without it's faults."
4,Great deal for the money,"I purchased one of these TVs about 3 months ago as a replacement for a 13-inch. I looked at several other makes and models, but this one was definitely the best deal for the money. The TV has relatively good picture and descent sound quality. The remote is comically oversized, which does make it harder to lose. The TV does need to be faced towards where your sitting or the picture can be difficult to view, especially with bright lights on in the room. Overall, I have been completely satisfied with it."
4,What a great TV!,"After reading the generally favorable reviews on this TV I ordered one and it arrived a few days ago. I am very pleased. Basically just plugged it in and turned it on. The picture is excellent. I bought a Magnavox 15"" LCD TV last year for around $500 and was pretty disappointed. The picture quality is not very good but it was too much trouble to send it back. Plus having a flat screen TV was still better than the huge picture tube thing I had before. But this TV is awesome! The picture is bright and clear (and the rather large remote that people complained about is not THAT huge). I am VERY tempted to order a second one right away. I strongly recommend this TV."
1,No New Information,For someone with NO computer experience this is a worthwhile book for everyone else it is useless. It does not contain genealogical information it is merely a book on how to use a computer (from how to turn one on) and how to log on to the internet (you must have an ISP). For a book titled such as this one is there should be information on sites.
2,More of a beginner's guide to the Internet than to genealogy,"Although this book is subtitled ""Genealogical Research on the Internet,"" it is really more of a basic guide to using the Internet than it is an aide to genealogical research. A large portion of the book is dedicated to subjects like ""How to Send and Receive E-mail Messages,"" ""How Mailing Lists and Newsgroups Work,"" ""Getting to Know Your Browser,"" and ""How to Access a Web Site."" Included are indexes of genealogical mailing lists, personal web sites, searchable databases, libraries, and archives, and a listing of the categories on Cyndi's List on the Web. Roughly 20% of the content is genealogy-specific, much of which is available on Cyndi's excellent website. This book will be most helpful to readers who are new to cyberspace but anyone who already knows how to send e-mail or surf the Web will find it less useful."
1,Not for beginning geneologist...for the Internet novice,"Do yourself a favor: buy this book ONLY if you have absolutely NO (and I stress NO) experience with email or the Web. This book came with the geneology software I bought from Amazon. The software is great, but I ask you, would you even buy software if you were so techno-clueless that this book would be even remotely useful? It literally explains how to access a program: ""Click on Start - Programs ...""If you know anything at all about the Internet, the book will be a waste of your time and money. (So if you found your way to this review, this book will be a waste of your time and money.) It is clearly intended for experienced geneologists who have never seen, much less used, a computer. The author claims that this book will be useful even if you have Internet experience. That is the only reason I'm giving this book one star. It's being marketed as if it were for all geneologists, but it could be useful for only a very small percentage of them."
2,Should be a geneology pamphlet instead,"For those of us more familiar with the ins and outs of internet resources (e-mail, newsgroups, search engines, and internet databases), the book could be condensed down from a 182-page book to around 25 pages of lists of resources in a pamphlet. (Or simply by visiting her website.) She does an excellent job of taking the newbie through it all, but I'm a geneology newbie, not a computer newbie, and it's more important to me to know where to look and what to look for, not how to use the tools to do the looking. I miss having a ""rating"" for how relevant or useful some of the resources she lists are."
1,Bits and Pieces,"I also opened to the first page with high hopes. Despite what was supposed to be a torrid love scene, I felt like I was reading bits and pieces put together to simulate a book. There was nothing to draw you into the story. There was no heart. I will instead reread Shanna or The Wolf and The Dove."
2,what happen to kew?,"Her last 3 books are not the same like the old ones like Rose In Winter, Flame and The Flower, Shanna etc. What happened? The new books isn't the same like the old ones. I'm still your loyal fan, but just take your time in writing your books, we'll always be here waiting for it."
1,"Stupid, boring, a waste of time","UGH, what a bore. I have been a fan of Ms. Woodiwiss' sincereading Shanna. I consider that title and Ashes in the Wind to beexcellent examples of the genre, and my favorites. I've reread them many times. Since those books, however, I've been increasingly disappointed, and after this garbage, I will never buy another book of hers again. Nothing happens until p. 179, and the ""mystery villain"" is never a mystery. What plot there pretends to be is paper thin. Ms. Woodiwiss seemed to be exploring her extensive vocabulary without a goal for her ramblings. Ick. Don't waste your money. END"
5,A Season Beyond A Kiss,I have purchased all of Kathleen Woodiwiss books. As far as I am concerned she is an excellent romance author.
1,A Season Beyond a Kiss,"Kathleen Woodiwiss was my favorite author for many years. Her earlier books are marvelous. I was introduced to the world of romance novels with Shanna, truly a work of art. However, I was unable to even finish her last two books. I think I got through 18 pages of this book and realized I was never going to be able to finish it. What a shame. I would give this 0 stars if it were possible."
3,"Enjoyable, but?","I enjoyed reading this book, but not as much as the previous Birmingham stories. I was a little let down by having to read this ""out of sequence"". In my opinion, this should be read between Flame and the Flower and The Elusive Flame. I think it took a while to really be able to get absorbed in this one, and some other reviews are correct - the villain isn't so much a villain. Still, I didn't have any trouble finishing this and will most certainly continue to add KW books to my collection."
2,A Season Beyond a Kiss,"I enjoyed the reintroduction of the Birmingham clan. However, as a long-time Woodiwiss fan, and one who had this book on order for almost eight months, I was extremely disappointed. The book had a such a feeling of deja vu about it. I kept thinking where have I read this before.The book was entertaining, but I was not driven to read until it was finished nor was it worth the wait. This is the first time I haven't been driven to obsession to finish a Woodiwiss novel. Kathleen, get a a grip."
3,Were my expectations too high?,"I was really looking forward to this book finally being published. In fact, I pre-ordered it (thank you Amazon) and kept checking to find that the publication was being delayed. Although I enjoyed the book, it did not meet my expectations. There wasn't enough depth to Jeff & Raelynn's story for me, and the characters weren't as developed as they usually are. The ""mystery villian"" really wasn't a mystery, the usual comic relief was lacking, and I expected more interaction with Brandon and Heather throughout the story (ala Flame and the Flower). I'm not sorry I bought it, since it completes my collection. And I don't think it was her worst - I give that distinction to Come Love A Stranger."
2,Boring,"I ordered this book before the release date banking on Kathleen Woodwiss's name.Having been a fan since The Flame and The Flower, I felt it would guarantee a good read, evidently she did too. I'm sure this book made best seller lists, and she made money, and I'm just as sure that I'm not the only disappointed fan.This is the second time I've attempted to get through this boring read. 200 pages into it and I'm still waiting for it to get interesting."
1,A Season Beyond A Kiss,"It is unfortunate that Ms Woodiwiss is obviously merely fulfilling her contractual obligations in cranking out yet another book about the Birminghams. I have always looked forward to her books with great anticipation. What a pity that I spent money on this drivel. The heroine is vapid, fickle and far too whiney to be believed. The hero too good to be true and then some. Please somebody hand me a fan I think I have the vapors!"
1,A Season Beyond a Kiss,"Help! I've Been Robbed! When I purchased A Season Beyond A Kiss, I did not even check the price. The author's name on the front was enough. I have noticed a weakening of storyline and characterization since Wolf And Dove, Shanna, and of course, Flame and Flower. However, I never expected KW to write anything so incredibly poor. I scanned it, fast forwarding past whole chapters and finally read the unsatisfying conclusion. While I was in the process of reading this boring mishmash, I chanced a glance at the price label and nearly fell out of my chair. Talk about inflation! When I think about the cost of The Flame and the Flower, the book that hooked me on historicals in the first place, compared with this long, boring, pricey book, it makes me sick. I think the author should refund; I've been robbed!"
1,A Reason to make this a MISS!,"I first read Shanna by Kathleen Woodiwiss, 10 years ago, and I loved it!! Since then I have read everything she has put into print. To say that I was disappointed by this book is an understatement. Too much time spent going over how good looking Jeffrey and Raelyn both felt the other was, and too little time spent on story development. I give this book a big thumbs down!"
2,Not worth reading,"I read the Birmingham famly saga completely out of order; however, doing so did not confuse me immensely. This was the last book that I read, but it takes place after The Flame & The Flower but before The Elusive Flame as far as timeline (although it was published after The Elusive Flame). I felt like it was not KEW writing this book....the love scenes were a bit more graphic/crude and the character development was uncharacteristic of her writing. Also, the way that the book picks up mid-story confused me a bit and required KEW to provide details explaining the back story throughout the first half of the book. I did like the supporting characters of Elizabeth and the couturier, but Raelynn and Jeff left me unfulfilled. Gustaf and his bumbling henchmen also seemed a bit too slapstick for me."
3,Not your Typical Woodiwiss (spoiler?,"Seems to me perhaps this novel was finished in a hurry.. the way it starts off makes me think that perhaps she was pressured to make it a shorter novel than it originally was, and rather than sacrifice the traditional Woodiwissian struggle and triumph at the end of the book, she did her best to explain the beginning, in effect turning about 6 chapters into one. I can't think of one other Woodiwiss book where a union has been consummated so quickly! (except perhaps Shanna, but that was designed to leave the reader on the edge of her seat.) Around the middle of the book we start seeing the classical Woodiwiss worldbuilding coming into play. To be honest, it seems uncomfortable and not up to her usual standards, but if you're willing to slog through the first half the second may placate you. I will agree with another reviewer that the (original) conflict between them doesn't make much sense.. unless you happen to be a very insecure young woman. Like me :)"
1,I'm SO relieved!!,"I'm so relieved to read the other reviews of this book. I've read other Woodiwiss books and loved them all and was eagerly looking forward to reading more about the Birminghams. 150 pages into the book I was incredibly bored and came to this site to see if the reviews would convice me to keep reading, or give it up. I've decided on the latter!"
1,A Season Beyond a Kiss,"I have been a fan of KEW for over 20 years. I've loved all her previous novels; The Flame and the Flower, Shanna, The Wolf and the Dove, Come Love A Stranger, Ashes in the Wind. But the last two were a great disappointment. I couldn't even get through her last effort. It was tedious and the characters were shallow. I hesitated writing this review because I am such a big fan of hers, it breaks my heart to see this obvious deterioration in her writing - it almost doesn't seem to be the same person who wrote The Flame and the Flower."
2,This is not the Woodiwiss of the past,"As a devoted Kathleen Woodiwiss fan, I was very happy to find her newest novel, ""A Season Beyond a Kiss,"" in print. Unfortunately, this book was an extreme disappointment, which has been the case with her most recent novels. I was hoping for the type of story and character development that she displayed in ""The Flame and the Flower"" and ""Ashes in the Wind"" (my all-time favorite book), but I could barely get past the first few chapters. The plot is weak, the dialogue is inane, and the characters are regrettably forgettable. This is NOT the quality of the Kathleen Woodiwiss of the past. For new Woodiwiss fans, check out her earlier novels (""The Wolf and the Dove,"" ""The Flame and the Flower,"" ""Ashes in the Wind,"" ""Shanna,"" ""A Rose in Winter""), and you will be able to see the difference."
3,This is a continuation of a short story from an anthology...,"I noticed that some of the reviewers mentioned that they felt like they were missing some of Jeff and Raelynn's story. If you don't read Three Weddings and a Kiss, Woodiwiss's anthology with Lisa Kleypas, Loretta Chase, and Catherine Anderson, then you will indeed miss the beginning of this book. The story in the anthology is named The Kiss, hence the title for this book - A Season Beyond a Kiss. I didn't realize that either. I read them in the wrong order, and so I thought I'd tell you about it. Be forewarned though, The Kiss is very, very short - the shortest story in the anthology consisting of only a few pages."
1,A Season Beyond all Comprehension,"I wanted to like it. I really did. I even went so far as to ignore the mostly bad reviews it was given here at Amazon. I just loved Jeff Birmingham in Flame and the Flower and fully expected a continuation of a great character in this book. But I couldn't even finish it. It doesn't even seem like a Woodiwiss novel.In fact, I actually felt embarrassed for Ms. Woodiwiss while reading A Season Beyond a Kiss. WHAT HAPPENED!"
1,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to this story being a K.W. fan, but unfortunately this story was very disappointing. When will she write one to equal ""Flame and the Flower"" or ""Wolf and the Dove""?"
3,A little disapointed,"I own & have read every book that Kathleen Woodwiss has written, this one is not her usual standard and at times I wondered if someone else has written this book.A little disappointing."
2,Where is the book that should have preceeded this one?,"I am so glad that I read the review by 'airgeadach' from Bangor, PA. I was beginning to think that maybe I was missing something but now I know that it wasn't just me who thought there must have been a previous book that wasn't mentioned anywhere. I'm only on page 74, but from the beginning I have wondered where the first part of this story is.The story is okay, but nothing like Brandon and Heather's stories in the first two books.Very disappointing."
1,The worst book I've read for years...,"Before you buy this book - PLEASE READ THE REVIEWS HERE AT AMAZON.COM! I wish I did!A season Beyond a Kiss, by KW was really boring. I don't know how I managed to finish it. The story line was not interesting. The characters were predictable and unreal. I couldn't believe what was written most of the time. I almost had to put the book down when KW wrote, ""Where she was weak, he was strong; where she was gentle and submissive, he was firm and aggressive; where she was clever at managing the house, servants, and a host of other things, he was astute at him many business affairs, his horse operation, and running the plantation."" Give me a break. This stuff is ridiculous! I definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK!"
2,Where's the Jeff we knew?,"The story was merely okay, and I'd looked forward to reading about Jeff. But this was not the same guy from The Flame & The Flower. The author totally changed his personality. Also, I like depth and a decent plot, not books where the hero and heroine are constantly bickering and at battle with one another. That would make for a very unhappy life, living day to day like that. It leaves the reader dreading every scene where the characters converse."
4,A Charming addition to the Birmingham's,"I had no trouble making it through this book in three days. It got my attention in the first ten pages and held it till the end. I enjoyed getting to know Jeff's character better and seeing Heather and Brandon again. It seems that Woodiwiss has come a long way with the Birmingham's. However, it is easy to see what the outcome of unexpected events will be."
2,A waste of money,This book was really a disappointment to me. I loved the Flame and the Flower and the Elusive Flame. One word can describe this book: SLOW. Kathleen E. Woodiwiss could have done a much better job with this book if she would have not have gone into so many boring and irrelevant details.
4,Makes you smile,"Though I am not typically a romance reader, someone gave me this book as a gift and so I picked it up to read one evening. I thought it was incredibly entertaining, romantic, and heartwarming. Easy to read and leaving you smiling, it does everything a romance novel is meant to do. I was not at all disappointed, perhaps because I'm not a die hard fan of such writing, but I thought it was worth reading."
2,Not Worth the Wait,"I should have known after it took over two hours to get past the first 50 pages that I was in trouble. This book was utterly disappointing. The caliber of writing is not up to the normal standards of K. E. Woodiwiss. I purchased this because it was a sequel and expected it to be just as good as its predecessor. Jeff Birmingham and Raelynn Barrett had no chemistry. I had no compassion for either of their plights which wasn't worthy of a storyline. The neverending commentary about fashion, was equally annoying and seemed to be used just to fill pages. This publication could have been a lot more in depth and to promote it as something we've been waiting for was a ruse. Next time I'll wait and pick up a copy from the library!"
1,Still trying to finish this one,"I, like the other reviewers, am an avid fan of all of Ms. Woodiwiss' other novels. I remember with joy reading ""The Flame and the Flower"" when I was in high school. I read most of her other books in two sittings or less. I am still trying to get through this one. The characters are week - Raelynn is insipid - and the Jeff Birmingham we knew and loved in ""Flame"" appears weak and unable to make any strong decisions. Perhaps someday I will be able to finish this novel - maybe it gets better towards the end?"
3,It's Jeff's story this time,"I've been a fan of Ms. Woodiwiss' since I read the Flame and the Flower. I was very happy to read Jeff's story since he was so deserving of some romance in the Flame and the Flower.Unfortunately, I don't like his wife Raelynn as much as I LOVED AND STILL LOVE Heather (his sister in-law). This is a must read for Flame & the Flower fans but on it's own it's just kinda lukewarm.The sex is very sensual but again it's not as exciting and enticing as Brandon and Heather's story."
3,Disappointed,"I was so excited to pick up a new book by Kathleen Woodiwiss. However, like most of the other reviewers I too have been disappointed with how slow the book moves and the flakey character of Raelynn. I did have the advantage of reading Three Weddings and A Kiss-a collection of short stories featuring a sequel to Flame and the Flower. That short story fully explains the unexpected meeting of Jeff Birmingham and Raelynn. Maybe reading that story will help explain the beginning A Season Beyond a Kiss."
1,WISH I'D READ THE REVIEWS,"I wish I had read the reviews before buying the big, relatively expensive introductory edition. This book barely deserves mentioning when compared with Woodiwiss's other books. Raelynn is such a twit, I was happy to see Jeff's plan to dump her. The entire story seemed forced and superficial. Liked Jeff, but then, had the advantage of knowing him through his brother's story.The most irritating thing about this was the contrived story outside of the book that this one was supposed to be based upon. A totally ridiculous ""literary"" device. Shame on you, Kathleen Woodiwiss. Better to write nothing more at all than to manufacture a story with no heart."
1,What's happend to Kathleen?,"I really wish I had read other reviews before purchasing this book... what a disappointment, I could barely finish it. I'm a long time K.W. fan and can't believe how her writing has changed. Seems like with this book and Petals In The River she is relying on old plot lines from previous books. I found the relationship between Jeff and Raelynn totally unbeliveable and very frustrating as a reader. I really hope that K.W. or her publisher check these reviews. I won't jump to buy her next book - I'll check it out at the library first!"
1,Will The Real Woodiwiss PLEASE Stand UP?,"I read my first Woodiwiss book in 1974, and had been a FAN(atic) since. After diligently struggling to read this book, I have sadly decided to never waste my money on another. The characters were shallow. The plot boring. The heroine giggled coyly so often, I was close to gagging. Since ""Petals On The River"", I have vainly waited for the old Woodiwiss magic."
1,not the same,"I started reading KEW books over 15 yrs ago.I had 2 small children and when they went to bed it was my time to read. I cant tell you how many times I enjoyed her books. Now I cant even recomend her new books to anyone. I dont know what the problem is but to me this is not the same author that I fell in love with years ago.It makes me so sad,I paid full price for this book and I could not even finish it."
1,Disappointing,This was a real disappointment to me. Ms. Woodiwiss' previous books were so well written and enjoyable. This one was very slow and not well developed. Certainly far below the standard she set with The Flame and The Flower.
1,Most Boring Book of the Year,"I wish I had read the reviews first and I'm glad I got the book discounted at Sam's Club because it is soooo awful. The writing is terrible. Long, overwrought sentences that seem to never end. This is the first Woodiwiss book I've read since reading her books in the 70's. I can't help but wonder--since I also read Rosemary Rogers back then and it's obvious her current books aren't what they once were either--that they are written by ghost writers. I can't imagine Woodiwiss would write anything this bad. Characters are nitwits and there's no plot. Yuk."
1,THE WORST!!,"This is one of the worst books that I have ever read. It definitely is not in the same league as her earlier books. This one is a sleeper to begin with. If you can get through the first two chapters, maybe you can actually finish the book. The two main characters, Jeff and Raelynn are two of the worst characters ever put together. There is no chemistry between them that would make the readers to want to know more. Even worst one particular plot comes to mind -- ""When Raelynn runs away into the woods without a horse, (on foot) no food and better yet in her nightgown."" If Jeff had half a brain -- instead of chasing her, he should have closed the door -- and said ""good riddance."" And please tell me how could Raelynn fall off of a horse in her 3rd month of pregnancy, and still maintain this pregnancy. You can only wonder at the condition of this poor child at birth. Please save your money -- don't bother buying this book. If you can't find anything else at the library, pass this one up too."
3,so/so,"It's not that the story isn't good but if based on her other books, it has a different feel. While we witnessed the devastating beauty of Heather (I mean, could one more person rip her clothes off?)Raelynn's beauty is said to be just as equal, but not as mentioned. For that I was grateful. I love Jeff, but he wasn't as funny this time round and the fact that you are reading his story after Beau's was a bit odd. Over all, I think it is a good read as long as you do it with an open mind. It might also help if you read the family's saga in the real order....Brandon, Jeff, Beau !"
2,A Season Beyond a Kiss,"I have loved every one of her books....except this one. Jeffery and Raelynn deserved a better story. This book was so wordy! She took too many pages to say what could have been said in one! Honestly, I thought I would never get finished reading it. I was very disappointed, but I will continue to read her other great novels."
3,did not pack the usual punch,I was eagerly awaiting the release of this book. I had already read the two short stories before this and had read THE FLAME AND THE FLOWER countless times. I am an avid fan of Woodiwiss and have all her books. With this one I was very disapointed. It did not show the promise that the two short stories had on it. It did not build on the charachters or the plot. You knew what was going to happen before it did. I was very disapointed. IF you want to read this book check it out of the library just don't buy it.
1,Who wrote this book?,"I love Kathleen Woodwiss' novels and have reread them over and over again, so when I FINALLY finished this novel I sincerely wondered if she wrote book (I can't even bring myself to call it a novel). Where were the well defined characters? The engrossing romance? And most importantly, where was Jeff from The Flame and the Flower? He was fun and gentlemanly in the first novel, here he's a boring boorish ape. Even Brandon and Heather were dull.And I thought that in The Elusive Flame, Jeff & Raelynn's first born was named Barclay, why was he called Marcus here? Just a shabby imatation of her earlier novels."
3,Disappointed,I was very disapponted in this book. I found that the writing did not compare to her earlier books. First of all you have to have read the two previous short stories about Jeff Birmingham to understand where this story starts. Maybe those two stories should have been added to the front of the book. Also the sex scenes were written a little too explicit or rather as if thats all they thought about. It was very easy to figure out who the villain was before the you got halfway through the book. The story became more interesting at about page 420.
2,Disappointing,"I have been a huge fan of Kathleen Woodiwiss since I read 'Shanna' in high school. I've read every book she has written. The last few, in my opinion, have not been as well written as her earlier books. 'Flame and the Flower' is one of my favorites and I have read it numerous times. But 'Season Beyond a Kiss' was a disappointment. I agree with another reviewer, maybe they left out the first portion of the book for financial publishing reasons - I don't know. I felt like a vital part of the storyline was missing.The heroine was very wishy-washy as well. Jeff Birmingham's character was wonderful at times and actually too good to be true. I spent half of my time being angry at Raelynn. Things would be fine between the two of them for awhile and poof - Raelynn was taking off again!This was an OK read, but certainly not one of Woodiwiss' best. Borrow the book from someone - don't buy it yourself!"
4,I still love Woodiwiss,"Everyone is talking about how ""unbelievable"" some of the plots are. Well, I guess I don't know of too many romance novels where the plots are entirely believable. That's why I love them so! It's a stretch of your imagination. I loved Raelynn and Jeff Birmingham, this book still made me want to get to the part where all their problems are resolved as quick as possible! I can't wait to go back and read my old Woodiwiss's, this one just made me remember how much I love all of them."
1,Missing something,I have read all of Ms. Woodiwiss's books in the past and for the most part loved every one until now. I don't know what happened but it felt like there was so much more that happened to the characters even before the first chapter. I would like to have been there when they met not just been told a few tid bits about what sounded like interesting material. It leaves me wondering if Ms. Woodiwiss's editors cut out the first part of the book just to cut some financial corners. I was truly disappointed and have spent two months now trying to wade through the book and feeling totally disappointed each time I pick it up.
3,Surprised by negative reviews,"I hadn't read Woodiwiss in a long time. I read this book intwo days. Then, I logged on .....................................to find other Woodiwiss books. I was surprised at some of the reviews. I was especially surprised with the comments about Jeff's weaknesses being Raelynn's strengths and her weaknesses being his strengths. This is how my husband and I are - we compliment each other. I feel this makes for a good, strong marriage. One picks up where the other leaves off. Jeff and Raelynn go through hard times and remain together. Isn't this how it is supposed to be.Personally, I enjoyed this read. Maybe I'm a hopeless romantic or maybe I enjoyed it just because . . . . . ."
3,Out of sequence,"I am an avid Woodiwiss fan and have read and re-read her books. I especially enjoy following all the different escapades of each of the family members but was a bit disappointed with this one as I read the books in the order it stated only to find that ""The Elusive Flame"" should actually have been the last one as in this Jeff and Raelynn already had grown up children which made this one look extremely odd. I have read books out of sequence before but this has usually been my own fault. Apart from this I found the book enjoyable but not as riveting as some of her other books."
2,"Woodiwiss- shame, shame, shame","Shame, shame, shame on Katheleen Woodiwiss. If you have nothing good to write, then it is better not to write anything at all. I have read many of Woodiwiss' previous books and found them to be intriguing, interesting and well-versed. This book, however, was a true disappointment and did not bear any similarity to the style or intellect of the other books. I had to look at the cover flap a number of times since I couldn't believe that I was reading a Woodiwiss romance novel."
4,A Season Beyond a Kiss,"I loved this story although not as much as I loved The Flame and the Flower. I eagerly wait for another story from Kathleen E. Woodiwiss! I read some reviews saying that they wish she would write more about the Birminghams and I agree whole heartedly! I did wish she would have mentioned Brandon and Heather more in this story, but loved it just the same! I don't understand other reviews saying how bad a story this was, one in particular who said they didn't even care for Her Flame and the Flower, all I have to say to that person is write a story yourself! I would also say to Kathleen E. Woodiwiss, Bravo! You are a genius!"
1,This Book Doesn't Deserve A Star - It Was A Required Field,"I have read and loved Kathleen Woodiwiss books for years. The author has always had a talent for pulling the reader into the story. You could smell the smoke when the plantation burned in ""Ashes in the Wind"" - feel the warm breeze off the ocean on those hot steamy nights in ""Shanna"" - smell the scones baking in ""Petals on the River"", etc. This new book, is in the same catagory as a common romance that you read just to have something to do - not because you can't wait to see what happens next! The story is too rambling, it just never takes shape! It seems more like an outline for a book - I just wish Ms. Woodiwiss would take it back and finish it. It really could be a best seller - as it is, I can't even get through the first two chapters. I wish that I had believed the other reviews on this site, when I read them. I just could't understand how a Woodiwiss could not be worth reading - sadly, now I know."
1,Grief...I CAN do better...,"Ok...I should have known something was up when the book about Beau had his eyes the wrong color...But what the author did to Jeff was just criminal. I have a question? Did Kathleen E. Woodiwiss pass on and now its a ghost writer? That's the only thing that makes any sense because the person who wrote this couldn't be the same one who wrote Flame and the Flower, the #1 Romance book of all time. When I come away KNOWING that I could have done a better job for Jeff...well...nuff said. And to make matters worse...the editor was even sloppy.<sigh>"
1,I can't believe I paid for this!,"I've read comic strips with more developed plots and characters. The whole story is conveniently wrapped up in 2 pages by a ""confession"" in the last 10 pages of the book. One character ties it together with this one monologue. This is one of the worst novels I have read. I certainly will not waste time reading anything else by this author despite the fact that I consider her earlier works some of the best romance novels published."
2,Not the worst I've ever heard,"I tried to convince myself for some time that I liked this CD, but eventually, I failed. The lyrics were almost interesting, but the vocals were somewhat annoying and the music was downright generic. Call it indie rock if you like, but there are other little known bands out there that are actually fun to listen to. What really irked me though, was that the last track wasn't even a song, but a promo for their next album. Shameless."
1,Skip this one,"Worn out Beatle chord progressions. Mediocre vocals. Nothing new. I've heard better local bands, much better."
2,Big BTS Fan,I thought this album was pale in comparison to other BTS albums. All BTS albums! It was boring and seemed like all the songs had a similar theme in their lyrics. The words [were not good]--that was the major problem! ....
5,One of the best albums of all times,"Built to Spill has really succeed in created what should be a number one hit on the charts. I consider this to not only be one of their best albums, but also to be one of the best albums of all times. Conclusion: An all around terrific collection of music."
2,Pretty generic....,"I was captivated by ""Big Dipper"" after hearing it on NetRadio... I especially love the opening lines, reminescing about his child hood. Wondeful word play, spoken with child like wonder. If the rest of the album had been a third as good, I would have been happy - unfortunately, while remaining lyrically interesting, the music itself is pretty much your average indie/punkish sound. Big Dipper is the one stand out, with ""Reasons"" and ""Car"" being interesting also. Might be worth it if you find it in the bargain bin, otherwise, take a pass."
4,From Across The Pond... {4.5 Stars},"Border Crossing's striking debut, Ominous, is the kind of album that will definitely change your perception of what you think hip hop is. Heavily influenced by their varied musical upbringings, each member of the West London trio brings something different to the table. With help from fellow UK up and comers Usmaan, Ricky Rankin, Jehst, and Alex Watson, they fuse elements of the dancehall, R&B, jazz, dub, hip hop, and chill out genres to create a mellow, simmering, downtempo sound that stretches the boundaries of hip hop."
3,Not what they used to be.,"Very surprised to find that the seams don't quite line up, that there is excess material that needed to be sanded away and the gap at the backstrap. Older Pachmayrs seem to be produced a little better."
5,Surprise,"This book should be of interest to long time Catholics as well as converts and people wanting to learn more about the religion. Only ""Bishop Blacky"" is likely to already know everything in the book."
5,Great for the average catholic and non-catholic alike,"Easy to read, informative. excellent for families and those just comming into the church. Great for those who always wonder ""why do catholics do that?"" Not just for catholics, many traditions observe the same customs, now find out why."
4,Informative,"I really liked the book. It definitely informs. If you are new to Catholicism, all the details in this book may seem to be a bit overwhelming at first, and you may sense some lack of structure. But this is a very good manual of Catholic practices and traditions. The analytical level here is basic and accessible. I am sure that those who have been practicing Catholics all their lives will also learn something new in this book, especially about the history of their religion. Sometimes the things that are close to you are the least understood ones. Read it today."
3,Interesting,"I read it, don't quite understand where the author is attempting to take me as a reader. For instance, Halloween, is that a catholic custom or is it a Catholic custom? Why is it mentioned?"
5,Jesus According To The Roman Chronicles,"After throughly reading this incredible new work, I have come to the conclusion that a recap of history is inevitable if one is to truly understand religion, and this book does just that. By offering a plethora of insights from an ancient Roman point of view, this book depicts facts that the church would most definately be hesitant to expose."
4,A somewhat average collection of songs from rare singles.,"Most of these songs are alright but this is definately not a greatest hits album, but its good if you want to get some stuff that is out of print. oddly enough there are 6 cover songs in this collection.I would recommend tracking down, the albums entitled ""High's Lows and Heavenly Blows"" and ""Soul Kiss Glide Divine"".They are both more complete collections. ""Don't Go"", ""True Love..."" and ""Indian Summer"" are great phased fuzzed pop gems. The last 3 songs represent the more experimental side of Sonic's music and are interesting pulsing noises."
1,"Excellent film, horrible dvd","This is a beautiful and haunting film from Germany, and the 1 star is certainly NOT for the film. It is for the rotten dvd. This dvd from Vangaurd is shameful. Obviously ripped directly from another source, throughout the entire running time, a rectangular shape can be seen in the upper right corner of the screen. It's only a shadow, but it is incredibly distracting. The subtitles are awful, hardcoded and difficult to see. Worst of all, this didn't even play on my older dvd player. When inserted the player made an awful grinding noise and rejected the disc! It's not defective, because it does play on the other dvd player. the picture quality is soft, and blurry and not up to dvd standards. I don't know if all films from VANGUARD get this same awful treatment, but this quality is so bad that I will never buy any film on the VANGUARD label again. this is crap."
4,Mind boggling,"Fills the lack of common sense in religion's mystic explanations of the Bible by speculating litteral ones. If you have a minimum of open-mindedness, this book will drive you off the wall! Purely rethorical, though: don't search proofs here."
3,Frustrating,"Loved the series, the disks were scratched in places & the video would get ""hung up"" for a while in those places. VERY ANNOYING! Buyer beware!"
4,Friday the 13th:The Series,I was amazed to see how much these cost when I found them at the local Big Lots for 10 bucks each. Enjoyed the show back then and still enjoyed watching it today.Check out used Dvd stores before paying some crazy amount for these.
1,Very disappointed,I have been a Franklin planner freak for over ten years and have owned just about every binder they have ever made. This is by far the worst. Looks good and is well padded but the inside is thumbs down. I'm brand new to the palm and have just gotten a M100. The only way you can get this model into the case is to use the velcro (included) which will cover the serial number and part of the battery cover.
4,Cats rule,"I'm an avid viewer of National Geographic's old specials. Being a major cat lover, I think they really did a wonderful job here. The studying of farm cats and their comparison to their wild relatives was very interesting, not to mention cute (that little kitten being lost just about broke my heart). There's so much more to cats than their seemingly lazy and independent lifestyle.However, I'm taking off one star for the very, very morbid scene of an agressive male lion slaughtering a poor cub. I personally thought it was rather sick of them to put that in. I can't even bear to watch it."
4,Great video,"The highlight of this insightful video was a study of farm cats. The study revealed that when living in groups, the domestic cat behaves much like the lions in a lion pride in the wild. Just a really fun view of the world of cats and their wild relatives."
4,great product,"The first shipment was great, did as it's advertised, one problem I still haven't received the other one that's supposed to have shipped on the 1st of December!!!"
1,Can't be the same author!,"This book can't be written by the same author as all those wonderful Psi-Changling-Human books that I've been reading. The style is not the same, the characters are trite, and the dialogue strains crediblity."
3,Not what I had expected.,"For the cost, this is fine for my 4 year old's letter writing practice. The black board appears to be some sort of chip board or particle board with a smooth finish and perhaps chalk board paint. The black surface is not a true black board as I had expected. The surface is dry and harder to erase than real chalk boards. However it is fine for use with our Leap Frog DVD's and practicing our writing. If you're looking for a good chalk board, keep looking."
2,CHALKBOARD,WAS HAPPY WITH SIZE OF THIS AND WILL WORK PERFECT FOR WHAT I PAID FOR IT. HOWEVER WAS PAINTING SIDES AND THE WOOD COMES OFF AND YOU HAVE TO REASSEMBE
1,"This is not a ""chalkboard""","You get what you pay for. This is not a ""chalkboard"". It is a piece of compressed tac-board with a plastic finish on one side (meant to be the writing surface), framed with unevenly cut wood. The plastic writing surface is also a little hairy because the tac-board is really rough. Don't buy this is you are looking for a chalkboard you can write on."
5,Very Nice,"I bought 2 of these for Photography shoots. To write things like, children's ages, ""she said yes"" for engagement sessions, things like that. I haven't used them yet, but I did spray paint one and it looks nice. It was pretty easy to paint as well."
2,Not as Expected,"Though the photo does show that the chalkboard is grey I was not expecting it to be as light as it was. The chalk portion of the board is almost cardboard something I wish I knew. Needless to say I was going to use if for photography, but now will be using it as a paperweight."
3,Nothing special,"Its the perfect size for what I wanted, but a little cheaply made, served its purpose though! Not great, but not terrible!"
2,Gray Board,"I understand that this item is called a chalkboard and not a blackboard, however, the writing surface is gray and not smooth at all. I ordered a white chalk pen to write on it and it won't even erase. Not with water or window cleaner as one person suggested in the reviews for the chalk pen. I hope to fix it with chalkboard paint and maybe paint the frame white. It will probably end up costing more to fix it then buying a better chalkboard."
1,This is a VERY Bad Item...,"As the previous review indicated, you can't write on this. Actually, you CAN write on this, but you need the right chalk. I bought two different kinds of chalk that looked exactly the same. One chalk made a faint mark on the chalkboard, and one made a fainter mark. Yes, you can write on this, but the writing is very faint! ;) And yet, the chalkboard you see in the picture does not match the one we got. The area you could write in was gray, and the border was larger. And you can only write on one side of the useless chalkboard. Yeah, you really only have to write on one side, but...This is all I can say about this chalkboard. Overall, this chalkboard is useless. I have yet to find a good chalkboard..."
2,Get a ruler.,"It's not the greatest quality chalkboard, no, but it does what it needs to do.However in no way is this chalkboard 7x10. The actual writeable surface is 5x7 and the whole frame is about 6x9."
4,Affordable Entertainment,We got this chalkboard for our 2-year-old. He enjoyed drawing on the board and it's affordable. It's as simple as that.
5,One of the best bands/albums ever!,"I got a copy of this cd from my sister when I visited her in San Diego, CA. For the next month I did not take it out of my cd player! I listened to it over and over and over. They have a kind of dark rock feel to them, but they're not another ...clone like so many that you hear on the radio. I have never heard a band that sounds anything like them, nor have I heard many bands as good as them. I would encourage one and all to buy this cd. You will not be dissapointed.If you want to sample their music you can at VH1's website."
2,"Disappointment with revised, shortened version","Having heard the original, much longer version, I purchased this CD expecting the same. I found the shorter version hard to keep replaying because the examples just became to repetitive. Would much rather have the four discs any day."
3,The Secret Soundtrack,This CD was not what I was expecting it to be but I did enjoy listening to the instruction and conversation.
3,Slightly disapointed,"I had purchased the Secret on CD before and I thought I was getting the same as I already had. My previous one had four disks. This one only had two. I feel the information on my ""new"" CD's would be confusing to a new listener who haven't already heard my first ones or who hadn't seen the DVD.Also my case just fell apart when I received it. I don't know if it happened during shipping or what. But the presentation was lousy!"
5,Very excellent cd.,I have appreciated the message expressed in the cd's entitled The Secret. It is an very useful tool for me.
4,VERY INSTRUCTIVE,THE AUDIO TO THE SECRET IS GOOD BUT IT IS JUST A COPY OF THE VIDEO....IT DOES NOT ADD OR TAKE AWAYA THING....JUST BUY THE DVD...DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY UNLESS YOU JUST WANT TO LISTEN TO THE AUDIO FROM TYHE DVD IN YOUR CAR.BUT THERE IS ONE THING...IF YOU LISTEN AND YOU DONT HAVE THE VIDEO...THIS IS A GOOD ALTERNATIVE...SERGE
5,"Loved it,,,,excellant CD,I would recommend this to every single creature on earth,,,","This CD changed my life for forever....Everyone should listen to this.....This is what is life all about, the true Happiness...."
5,Great gift,This is a great book and I live by it every day. Give this book on CD to people in trouble all the time. I have one that I gave to someone they listened to CD's and have to pass it forward. Great deal as well. Change your life for the better and get this and one to share.
1,NOT THE ORIGINAL MUSIC as separate tracks -music and audio are mixed,"Hey just want to warn people that this is NOT the ORIGINAL MUSIC by itself. It's the teachers speaking over the music. Although many people know this fact (read the fine print), until the original score DOES get released (to the public) I want everyone looking for the original music to keep looking 'cause this ain't it!!! Maybe contacting the company who filmed the movie (Prime Time Productions & Paul Harrington) and requesting that it be released for retail purchase will help?Hope this helps and if you DO find the orginal score PLEASE respond to this review!!! :-)"
4,Just like watching the DVD,"I love the secret DVD and was looking forward to getting this set. It is a great way to reinforce the teachings of the DVD but I must admit that having the entire soundtrack with sound effects can be a bit distracting. I would love to own an expanded edition with all of the teachers able to share in a little more detail.That said, I love it and am very glad to own it."
5,Great Editing,"This is a great edit of the DVD. The best presenters are featured here without so much emphasis on getting more, but on living life to the fullest. The music is dramatic and creates wonderful emphasis on the CD. Plus, it's great to replay in the car."
5,This cd elevates me! =),I listen to this cd in my car on my way to work or wherever. It has been changing my life and making e visualize and make things happen so fast. It's incredible.
3,Not what I thought,"I purchased this thinking that I would be getting just the music soundtrack like I wanted, not the whole audio from the movie. I love the movie and would have loved to have the music for my meditation and acupuncture sessions. So be forewarned that this 2 disc set is the entire audio track of the movie. Narration and all."
5,El Secreto (Spanish version),"Got this book in the English version and loved it. Makes you see things in a different perspective. Got the Spanish version for my Dad who is very happy with the book. Also got the sound track for my daughter, who listens to it on her way to work. Would recommend this book or the CD to anyone."
3,Just Buy the DVD,I thought this was the Secret's music. It's just the DVD on CD. Don't waste money on it. You might as well get the DVD if you want to hear their voices. It's a much better experience anyway.
5,Excellent Jordan Almonds,"The Jordan Almonds we purchased from Grecian Imports were used as favors for our daugther's wedding. Not only did we rave about them, our guests did too. They were not your usual Jordan Almonds that can sometimes break a tooth. These are MOSTLY ALMOND with a THIN sugar coating. DELICIOUS! Shipping was quick and they were well packed (didn't arrive broken). Thank you."
1,Faded colored shell,"Very disappointing...I order this large bag for my wedding reception in pink, they arrived and half were faded almost to pale pink or white. They were so faded I wasn't sure if they we old or even any good. I couldn't use them at my wedding because they looked terrible. I had to go buy more at the last minute elsewhere as there was no time to return. Very poor quality."
2,Disappointing,I was expecting fresh and flavorful. Instead my shipment was quite tasteless; the candy coating had no flavor at all. I might just as well have bought Brach's at the supermarket for a lot less.
5,As expected,CD was just as described. I got this for my hubby b ecause he loves this movie. He said that the sound track helped relax him on a stressful driving trip in the snow.
1,Terrible sound quality.,I use two-way radios at work and on weekends and vacations. Until now I've been very happy with many different Motorola and Midland models. The FV-700 has great features but the sound quality is soooo bad it's virtually unusable. Don't make the same mistake I did.
2,"Poor sound quality, avoid.","I have to echo many of the below reviews. I bought six of these for work, and I get nothing but constant complaints about the sound quality. When you have to reply with ""What did you say?"" about half the time that somebody talks to you, there is a significant problem with the radio. With some users the sound is intelligible, so I'll give these two stars instead of one.When we subbed out these Motorolas for an inexpensive set of Uniden radios, the sound quality improved dramatically. Perhaps other Motorola models have better sound quality, but i'm not willing to spend more $$$ to find out. Consider yourself fortunate if you read these reviews and avoid buying this radio."
1,MOTOROLA SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES,"I 'VE HAD MANY WALKIE TALKIES IN THE LAST 10 YEARS. MY FIRST PAIR 10 YEARS AGO WERE MOTOROLA AND THEY WORKED GREAT. I ALSO HAVE A PAIR OF COBRA'S. THEY WORK GREAT WITH GREAT SOUND QUALITY AND RANGE. MY MODEL COBRA WALKIE TALKIES DO NOT HAVE PRIVACY CODES. BUT THEY WERE CHEAP. HOWEVER, THESE FV700 MOTOROLA WALKIE TALKIES ARE ABSOLUTLY HORRIBLE. THE SPEAKERS ARE SO BAD THAT YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND A WORD WITHOUT HAVING TO GUESS WHAT THEY SAID. I CANNOT BELIEVE MOTOROLA WOULD EVEN PUT THERE NAME ON THESE. MY KIDS HAVE TOY R US KIDS TYPE WALKIE TALKIES WITH BETTER SOUND QUALITY. THIS IS GOING TO HURT THERE WALKIE TALKIE REPUTATION. THE ONLY GOOD THING I LIKE ABOUT THESE ARE THE WAY THEY LOOK AND FEEL. DO NOT BUY. SAVE YOUR MONEY"
1,Absolutely useless!,I had the misfortune of buying not two but FOUR of these useless things. I had never owned walkie talkies before and I assumed that the garbled sounds I was hearing from the Motorolas was how all walkies sounded. Then I heard someone else's Unidens and I realized that I was holding a steaming pile of dung in my hand. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
5,Great way to keep small parts seperate while working,This is a great way to keep from losing small parts when doing odd jobs. Fits great in a 5 gallon bucket.
2,MMM it's ok,"Well although I'm not entirly happy with the product, it does serve it's use. The price was right but if you can find it localy do so and save yourself the shipping."
4,Skeletal Trauma Book Review,"This book was used so I could write a paper for one of my graduate school classes. It was very helpful and I would recommend it to anyone doing research on skeletal trauma, or if you just want to read about it this topic, the more the merrier."
1,The History of American Funeral Directing,"I really feel sorry for anyone who has to read this book. What a pompous waste of ink! I can't believe that in the more than 50 years since this book was written, no one has come out with a better history on this subject. This book could easily be rewritten using one third of the words and be much more useful. It is too bad that most of us reading this nonsense are doing it because we have to."
4,Kids Frog/prince Hat,"Very cute; a bit difficult to ""turn"" or reverse; not easily done by a young child, maybe an older one."
5,Awesome!,"After using one of the regular Manhasset stands for conducting for the past six years with my orchestra, I decided to splurge for this stand and see what a difference it would make. I am incredibly happy with the amount of room I have for scores, a place to put my pencils and baton, and the impressive perception that ensemble members get from seeing it from their sections. :)"
4,Reason for celebration,"A new commentar on anceint Latin source is always a reason for celebration among the lovers of Roman history and culture.This book of Donna W. Hurley is by far much more than the usual textual comments for students of Latin language. It is a comprehensive review of almost all what is worth knowing about Claudius and about the biograpy written by Suetonius, all this in addition to the very educating learned comments and explanations on the text per-se.The writer shows great mastery of the relevant research findings, both about the emperor Claudius and Suetonius himself.The only shortcoming of the book is that it is not a book for the casual educated reader which may find it difficult to encompass. This book shall serve best those who are well acquainted with the history of Rome and the Latin language. Such readers will have endless hours of great pleasure."
5,Can't have a computer without one,"Easy to install, I find this a necessary add-on to my Mac.Protects the area around the keypad from scratches and general wear-and-tear.My watch tends to scratch my MacbookPro case, and this solves the problem."
4,Deceptively easy listening,Music for Travellers is an album that takes it easy -- but give it time to sink in and it will reward you with a slow burning ardor.
1,Don't Buy - No cable,"Do NOT buy this product based on the product description. I did, but the advertised USB Cable was not included. On my complaint, Amazon quickly sent another Power Adapter, but again without the USB cable. I'm now in the process of having to return both Power Adapters and have bought another adapter, which included the USB cable, from another company outside of Amazon."
1,Terribly designed: Incline press uncomfortable,"This bench is well built, but terribly designed.The incline position is terrible, the bottom seat doesn't incline, and you have to seat a little forward, which can cause a back injury.Buy it only to use it as a flat bench."
4,Judenrat leader remembered,"An outstanding description of the background conditions of Jews in pre-war Czechoslovakia, written with great understanding and based on thorough research. The story of the establishment of the Terezin ghetto is extremely well told, but the remaining chapters are a bit too long and too detailed. An exceptionally fine memorial for Edelman and similar honest and upright leaders of the Judenrat."
2,Boring,After hearing a live version on satalite radio I was disapointed that the studio version lacked the energy and punch of the live cd. Also I can't figure out why the live cd is a costly $49.00 ?
3,Good Old Style Music,Great Harmony and Great Tunes. I guess when it comes down to it I just prefere some of the solo artists from this time period. Too many of the songs sound very similar to each other. But I do like them and this CD has become a regular part of my listening rotation.
4,"Excellant cd for doo-wop, harmony.","The Ink Spots bring about a sweet harmony with such songs as If I didn't care (which later became a hit for the Platters), and Maybe (which is used in the hot 1998 RPG comp. game Fallout. The music can transport you back to the nostalgic 1940-1950's, however, the music is timeless."
2,"next, please","The instrumental quality displayed on this disc is good , but it doesn't make up for the lack of depth or meaning to the lyrics. A disappointment, to be sure."
1,Fading soon,"Overall, I found the album to be extremely unoriginal. Whereas the drum beats and the guitar riffs were decent, there is nothing that sets this band apart from the rest of the alternative/modern rock genre. The lyrics are not at all catchy, the similes are sometimes crude, and the undertones of the words are negative towards relationships, and seem to promote revenge all too often."
4,Beware--Handle height is shorter than Corolle claims,"This is a beautiful, sturdy, very ""realistic"" toy carriage. I love it. However, the box it came in and many websites I visited before making this purchase state that the handle height is adjustable up to 30 inches when the handle is aligned with the rest of the carriage. Not true! At the level pictured on the box, the handle height is only 27 inches. Even if the handle is in a totally vertical position, it is only 29 1/4 inches high. A few inches is a big deal to me as my daughter is very tall. At this price I would expect the company to publish accurate measurements."
5,grannys review,I have researched doll carriages for at least 18 months to find the best one for my 3 yr old granddaughter to play with now and in the next few years. This one can be adjusted to fit her size as she grows. She plays with it all the time and loves it.
4,a thousand good quick reads,"I enjoyed this book throughly! It's an excellent resource for speech writing or for creating your own personal fables (to be passed on through conversation and lessons). I also liked how many of the stories were cross referenced when multiple people were involved, and how a few of them were retold in different ways when listed under different people.My only complaint... (and this is a big one!) is that the list of celebrities and historical figures is extremely westernized. There are only a handful of eastern and middle eastern people represented. Even Eastern Europeans are greatly outnumbered by the British and American figures. And god forbid that we include anyone from the Southern hemisphere. I'd like to see more variety in the next edition, or even a companion book with some 'minority' focus in it."
5,Kata H-14GDC Holster Case,"I am very pleased with this product. My Nikon D-40X fits securely with the lens attached as well as the telefoto lens snugly tucked beneath. There is room for memory cards, lens cleaners and other accessories. The strap is adjustable and comfortable. My only complaint is that the clasp is hard to open. It was advertised to be able to open it with one hand, but I definitely need two hands to do so. However, I would rather have my camera secure, than able to fall out. I love the sturdiness and appreciate it being weather resistant."
3,same tracks different cd,"Wish I could get excited, but this CD has the exact same tracks as 5 other cd's that I own, just in a different order.It's hard to get excited about the version of ""Riverdance"" on this cd, since I have the ""Riverdance"" cd and this version is just missing something... like energy and taps. The version of Whiskey in the Jar is way too slow. My favorite track is Three Young Ladies Drinking Whiskey Before Breakfast, however this exact same track is on 3 other cd's."
2,A Disappointment,"There were no program notes other than the titles of the tracks such as Courante, Sarabande, There was not even information on Andrew Lawrence-King. I had never purchased a Sony Legacy recording, and I presume that perhaps all recordings on this label have no program notes. I will probably not buy another Sony Legacy CD even though it claims to be an ""industry leader"". The music itself was well recorded and since I expected early music, this was not disappointing. I just like to know the composers and performers. Signed, Roadrunner, a NM Music Lover"
5,"ORQUESTA NENO GONZALEZ- ""LO MEJOR DE NUESTRO REPERTORIO""","This great CD recently recorded in Havana Cuba, includes new, updated versions of old classic hits by the memorable cuban charanga band ""Orquesta Neno Gonzalez"". Some of the old time Neno Gonzalez personnel like, ""Mazacote"", ""Pikin"", ""El Ruso Abal"" and Barbarito Lopez, were reunited for the recording sessions of this great project, produced by cuban producer Luis Dominguez,CEO of the famed ENVIDIA label, who resides in Barcelona, Spain. Listen to blockbuster Neno hits like ""Mi Son Vueltabajero"", ""Como Camina Maria"", ""El Viejo Celoso"", ""Se Seco El Manantial"", ""Cha Cha Cha Bururu"", ""El Pescador"", ""Besame Si Si"", ""Guayacan"", etc. Also included in this great compilation is the never before recorded orchestra theme! If you like the famed cuban charanga sound, you'll love this CD. I highly recommend it!"
1,Very badly written author's personal packing list.,"This is such a badly written book that I'm returning it. Even if the reader can discount the irritating and prolific use of exclamation marks (something my English grammar teachers taught me were a sign of bad writing), poor grammar and spelling and clearly non-existent proof-reading, the actual content does not live up to the promise of the title, and does not take into account individual differences of potential readers. $15 is too much to pay for a copy of someone else's. packing list. The four-page chapter on the same topic in ""Looking Good"" by Nancy Nix-Rice is much better value and more easily individualised."
1,What a waste!,"I wish I had seen some of the reviews before I bought this book a couple of years ago. I get mad every time I see it in a ""search results"" list. It is poorly written, badly edited and has very little useful information. But it has made me think that perhaps I could write a packing book..."
1,"Good idea, but very poorly written","I was disappointed in this book, because the really useful information could have been summarized in two pages. The author just keeps repeating herself all the way through the book. On top of that, it is so badly written that I am planning to return it. The author either needs to learn how to write, or needs to hire a good editor."
1,disappointing,This dictionary is a big disappointment. There is no information on indonesian grammer. It does have a pronounciation guide but it lacks many things that you expect a dictionary to have. I'm sending my copy back.
5,Smokin' R&B with extra salsa,"Contrary to other reviews of this album, I find Mongo in his element when applying his Latin rhythms to classic R&B. On most of these tracks it works, on some it REALLY works. If you're a fan of up-tempo, beat driven classic R&B you will love this collection."
4,thumping,Mongo Santamaria is one of the great percussionist of modern jazz. He made jazz more than just a listening experience. With Mongo playing you could move to the music in ways that other jazz forms did not allow.
2,Pink 'Palm Beach',"The last cut, the exquisite 'Afro Blue' is worth the price of the CD or, at least, that is what I am telling myself now that I own it. 'Watermelon Man' adds the other star for nostalgia's sake and 'Chili Beans' is admittedly funky. What remains though is a strange excursion into commercial bugaloo and R&B - think 'Austin Powers' meets 'Beach Blanket Bingo' - actually painful to listen to. It must have been a case of an artist (get 'Afro Roots' or 'Sabroso') providing what his producers and market demanded. Danceability? If you're throwing a 'Retro-Retro 60's' party, this is the CD for it; bring your pink 'Palm Beach' sport coat and your madras shorts."
5,fabulous old book,I grew up with a dilapidated old copy of this. It had no front or back & most of the index was gone. I read in it all the time. I was interested in all things pioneer & self sufficient. This book speaks of birthin' babies & how to stop bleeding. Gobs of info on herbs & herbal remedies. I'm sure there are many new ways of doing things but if I were stuck somewhere without civilization nearby I'd want this book! Great reading if nothing else. Kentucky Woman.
5,"Beautiful, well-crafted pendant","I purchased this pendant for my daughter as a gift. This lovely pendant has become her very favorite piece of jewelry. She is an apparel-study major and has an eye for high fashion. My daughter pairs this beautiful accessory with numerous outfits, both dressy and casual."
3,could be better,"she has a wonderful voice, but i think she has the power to do more...i'm waiting for her first english album, should be released at the end of this century, well, if i can believe to all that rumours, let's wait and see!"
5,One of the best greek artist CD's in recent history,"This is one of the best Greek music collections around today. Anna is VERY talented and has a wonderfull voice. I was lucky to have seen her live last year and it was a treat. Great selection of ballads, rock and dance tunes. Even if you dont speak greek you will LOVE this CD."
4,good,"annas 1998 album is full of passionate performances.'gazi','mou anikis' ,'o ponos tis agapis', 'pali gia sena nai'.the title song is a good track but only if 'magava dut' and 'tilefonaki'were not included then it would have been much better.very nice!"
5,Excellent!!,"Even though I do not know Greek, the music alone is incentive to buy this CD. It is excellent and has prompted me to look for her other CD's too. I eagerly anticipate her next release!"
4,Getting into the Groove.,"Groovy album by unsung heroes of R&B/Dance/Funk. Chaka Khan is at her best here before over-production drowned out her rootsy, groovin charm."
4,Rags to Rufus...,"In 1974, I heard ""Tell me something good"" and noted what a ""funky"" tune it was, still is! The song was just ""gutsy."" and outside of Sly Stone, no one else was doing music that way. ""You got the love"" and ""Smokin' Room"" are the other stand-out tunes on this collection. Get your copy and jam! Four stars!"
4,Raves To Rufus,"1974 -- I wasn't even born yet, but I'm curious about the era's culture , music, and crazy fashion. The patchwork denim album cover graphic is what attracted me initially. Moments I love:The electric guitar in ""You Got the Love"" & ""Tell Me Something Good"". The rhythm in ""Rags To Rufus"", ""Sideways"", & ""Look Through My Eyes"". The horns and the funky electric piano in ""I Got the Right Street (But the Wrong Direction), ""Ain't Nothin But A Maybe"", and the title track. The Gospel fervor of ""Swing Down Chariot"". Rufus the Band is in top form, great musicianship. Chaka the Voice, sends chills up my spine. The main letdown is the short length of ""Sideways"". They should've extended the first part where you here Chaka wailing and the band studio jiving. That groove is just too tough!"
1,it sucked,i was suprized to see that the songs are boring not the best that she has done and i'm a die hard chaka fan!
4,this series is getting tiring,"gaia has grown up not knowing fear. so when her uncle loki givesher the opportunity to learn fear through an injection that hisscientists have been working on, she jumps at the opportunity. mywill gaia never learn not to trust everything at face value? uncle loki has his own sinister plans and they are as usual no good for gaia. this book is not one of the better ones of the series. i think pascal has run out of ideals and keeps going around in circles. this series needs some new life to it desperately."
4,Great book for beginners... Not for kids older than 7,"This book could be called Soccer 101... It's a great place to start if you have 4 to 6 year old children. It shows you how to teach the basics and how to keep them interested in the game..Good for a first time coach, or those of us that have not coached the first time time soccer player."
4,OK'ish. couldn't read it. wasn't very interesting,OK'ish. couldn't read it. wasn't very interesting. hard to read whilst watching a kid's soccer game. got better reading the docs handed out by the head coach
4,Great for beginners,"I've coached my kids teams for 4 years now --- 8 seasons in U6 and U8 --- and this was great for a dad who was drafted into the coaching business. The drills are nice, as is the pre-work it recommends. If you've played as a kid and now are being 'tapped' to be a coach for your kid, this is the book you need."
3,"Very basic and abbreviated, but a good start.","If you want to develop a system for making 10 and 11 year old girls understand simple offensive and defensive concepts, this book is not for you. Dealing with low attention spans is frustrating, and kids this age know it all, are mouthy, but have difficulty learning a new concept. With a practice of an hour a day for two days a week, you can't show much, and you can't be complex. This book needed MUCH more defensive emphasis."
4,BEAST!,"He is a beast on the mic, quite revolutionary and I love his guest appearances Jean Grae, Vordul Mega, etc. I definitely love his spontaneity. His short comings are few but mostly have to do with the fact that you have to pay real close attention to what is being said and I guess that could be summarized as ""clarity"", that needs improvement. But the concepts, floe, creativity is all on point. I rate this 4.5. If you love reality, conscious tracks get this."
4,C-Rayz Walz - Year Of The Beast,"Another good album by C-Rayz Walz. But to tell you the truth, I wasnt feeling it as much as I was feeling Ravipops. I think the production on this album was decent, pretty good in some parts and kinda wack in some parts. Lyrically, C-Rayz does good of course. So imma give this album a 4 starts. I still recommend Ravipops more. Well thats all I gotta really say about this album, decent production, good lyrics. Thought it coulda been better. But it still gets 4.My Top 5 Songs1.First Words Worse2.Knowledge3.Rhyme Intervention4.Street Reppin5.Music Take Ovah"
5,Reign of Silence,"I couldn't put this down once I started it! Every chapter held me on the edge of my seat and I just had to keep reading to see what was going to happen next! Tony Martin's first novel is brilliant and we hope that it is the first in a series of many.This is the tale of a small town minister who gets into something way over his head. The characters are very believable and if you've even been part of small town church life, you realize that this is probably exactly what would happen. I found myself wondering what I would have done if I had been in the same position.I love the character of Precious! I wish he were real because I would love to meet him!Altogether a fun read, but best not alone!"
5,A real page turner,"This book was great! I couldn't put it down and finished it in a few days. The characters were believable and it was fast paced. There were funny parts, serious parts and scary parts. The ony complaint I have was in the proof reading. There were some misspelled words that were very obvious and a wrong word used here and there. But all in all I would recommend this book."
4,Disquieting,"Reign of Silence was marvelously disquieting! Once engaged it was hard to put down. The characters reminded me of people who've populated my life so they provided much needed comfort in this tale of the spiritual and the supernatural. The fact that everything occurred in an ordinary place with ordinary people living ordinary lives made the events even more frightening to me. It produced in the back of my mind that niggling thought, 'this could happen to me."" Suffice it to say after finishing the book, I slept with a light on for a week! Thanks to author Tony Martin for this wonderful story. Here's hoping there are more to come."
3,Started off good,"This book should Really be put in the Christian section, not the horror section. It started off ok, but the last 20% of the book was all religious talk and OH SO BORING. And the ""twist/mystery"" has been done SO many times that it just made the whole book a total disappointment! Yet another Kindle book I used to put me to sleep at night. 4 1/2 stars? Are you kidding me?"
5,Spooky read!,"Great read that scares you to death and makes you think! While it is supernaturally inclined, it causes you to give pause and rethink what you believe about ghosts, demons, and even our own personal weaknesses. Once you start it you can't put it down. Now hit purchase, go get a snack while it's loading, (get a blankie so you can cover your head from time to time) and start reading;-)"
3,Great product!,"These have great gripping treads that help me navigate on the ice. Every once in a while, though, the velcro comes undone, and if you're not careful you'll walk away without them."
4,"Jagdwaffe Volume 3, Section 4: The War in Russia","I have continued to add the volumes of this series to my collection over the last 2-3 years. What started out as a passing interest in a couple of the late war volumes, continues to expand into the rest of the series as time goes on and I get the chance to read more of these volumes. If you have an interest in the air conflict during the Second World War, this series is not to be missed. It is not perfect, but it is as good as anything out there at the tactical and theater level. The scope of the entire series leaves little that is not covered."
3,Good Adventure But No Clear Begining,"NOTE: This adventure can be downloaded in its complete form off the Wizard's of the Coast Website as of 7/7/00I have been adding a little life to the town and have gotten a chance to read the adventure. The town is a little bland but has promise. The wilderness encounters are just outlines of the creatures in certain areas, but they can be developed with a little bit of work. The keep on bone hill is fun, but deadly and you would do well to have a group of adventures between 3-5 Levels before attempting it.The main thing that bugged me is that the adventure is not really setup, and requires a lot time to make it playable."
4,great fun!,"This adventure sees the PC's exploring the wilderness of the island of Lendore. Like B5 Horror on the Hill, there is ample wilderness encounters to break up the typical 'dungeon crawl' setting which might be getting a bit passe for the PC's by this level (written for levels 2-4 but could be suited to 5+). Having said that, the climax of the module is set in an old castle on top of bone hill which is populated by all sorts of nasy undead and the typical evil magic user. One criticism is that players of low level probably wont be able to kill the wraith at the end. Either substitute a lower level undead or play with higher level characters."
2,The most overrated show of the series!,This episode consistently ranks #1 on top ten polls of the original series but it does not deserve this distiction. The only good element in this episode is the character interaction but that's it! The story is very light-hearted and has no drama and little action. I would say that this episode's popularity is the greatest mystery in the Star Trek universe!
4,Star Trek Gold,"I will say up front that I was never a fan of the original series. The only character than ever made sense to me was Spock. However, the Tribbles were the best alien creature the original series had and this episode is Star Trek Gold."
3,Cheap and dirty horror,"First off Sy Fy / Aslylum enthusiasts should be aware that the Piranha flick isn't Roger Corman's classic, nor the remake, nor the double D. It's an old grindhouse flick ""Piranha, Piranha!"" with little piranha in it. Also Attack of the Giant Leeches is not the remake (Yes, they remade it) but the classic b/w film.Having said that - this goes for the cheap, usually used for $1. You Get Mega Piranha and Mega Shark vs Octopus (two greats in the mega series), 30,000 leagues and Beneathe Loch Ness. It's a really good deal. But with Mills Creek expect inconstant quality of their transfers. Mills Creek mostly puts out 50 packs of public domain flicks ranging from god awful to great. Luckily this is mostly good. There's no rhyme or reason to this collection - but it's a fun batch for movie parties"
1,6 movie pack on sharks,"Don't bother with this one. The movie is grainy and not good at all. It was a let down but ill get others in the future. Really, don't waste your money."
5,"the best, just the best","B.B. King has produced some wonderful live recordings; no surprise from an artist who performs as much as he does. His ""Live at the Regal"" is usually cited as the greatest, but in my opinion ""Blues is King"" is better and more exciting (although ""Live at the Regal"" is also a great recording). The performances here are blazing, and the guitar sound is achingly beautiful. I bought my first copy sometime in the late 1960s, one of the first blues albums I ever purchased. After thirty years, I still get a chill when B.B. says ""we're going to do our best to try and move you tonight...if you like the blues, I think we can."" Oh yeah, he can."
4,Hello MCA: Remastered Deluxe Edition needed here!!!,"I LOVE/HATE this CD!!!I LOVE the songlist, Duke Jethro's B-3, Bobby Forte's sax, and B.B's overall performance, which makes this perhaps his best live CD. That's saying a lot considering the other live examples from his prime...Live At Cook County Jail, Live In Japan, Live At The Regal...all of which have been remastered.I HATE the sound of this CD. As others have so rightly pointed out, the hollow, shrill sound of this makes it hard to put up with. It's just that the performance is quite simply B.B.'s best live CD.Is anybody at MCA Records listening? What we need here at a minimum is a lovingly made remaster. An Expanded Deluxe Edition Remaster would be a dream come true, giving this release the revered treatment it deserves!!"
2,"Best B.B. performance , but WORST SOUND. Shame on you Universal!","Some 20 years after this was sloppily mastered for CD, we are still without a proper sonic upgrade with additional material recorded at the show/s.Universal should go back to the original 3 or 4 track remote tapes and remix them and include previously unissued material.The performance is wonderful, but the frequent drop outs, poorly executed tape edits and extremely thin, shrill mastering on the current edition is truly depressing.Why is B.B. King's greatest live performance completely ignored by Universal and left in this terrible state?"
2,Cryin' Shame,"This is without a doubt the best B.B. King live performance available. Problem is, it's also the worst recorded one. It's so bad that I can honestly say it is unlistenable at normal listening levels. The only way I can listen to it is to turn the volume way down, otherwise it's something like nails on a chaulk board. Unless you're a completist, get Live at the Regal or Live in Cook County Jail"
1,How can it smell this horrible,This stuff is the worst smelling conditioner I ever encountered. The perfume penetrated my hair and has not been able to get removed. It took 2 days before the scent calmed down enough that it was not bothering me with its obnoxiousness. I wish I could give it a negative rating. I am glad all I used was a sample and did not pay money to make my hair stink.
1,All hype,"After seeing the Ojon products several times on TV, I finally decided to purchase the kit with the conditioner, shampoo and restorative hair treatment as well as the volume foam. I could not wait to try them. I gave the products week of steady use, and found that everything dried my air out. I have naturally wavy hair that I color. It tends to be dry, but not overly dry. The conditioner did nothing at all for my hair. It didn't even feel soft after use, with or with out using the Ojon restorative hair treatment. I have had much better results with cheap grocery store conditioners. The ""Ojon"" oil is just American Palm oil (Elaeis Oleifera) which is widely used in many food and beauty products. It is way too expensive for the poor results. I have read many reviews and see that a lot of people seem to like it, but I think it is all hype. I do not recommend, save your money!"
4,Love the product,"My hair's been ultra-dry lately, and it's definitely improved by using Ojon Ultra-Hydrating Shampoo and Conditioner. I love the fragrance and don't understand how people can find it offensive - it smells a bit like the old Flex shampoo and conditioner."
3,Not so great.,"It seems well constructed but I have alot of problem emptying my trailer because the tanks filler is right on top of the tank and sits to high, I had to raise my trailer and dig a hole for the tank to I could make it even work, I still have to raise the hose several times to get it to empty."
1,You must LOVE modern music to like this!,"You have to love the likes of Cage, Ligeti, Webern etc to like this music. If you love Beethoven, Mozart, Verdi and want to try exciting modern music, try Asyla by Ades."
4,"Oh no lo so, Magnifico!","This is truely a once in lifetime find of overseas madness! The sound is of dark (techno?) themes and the lyrics are neat to listen to, even if you don't understand German. There are 11 ""songs"" altho all the songs fit together as one. ""Caki Voli"" is beer drinking, fast dancing German folk song and I laughed the entire time I listened to the song (not that I don't understand German, it's just that sort of song that makes you happy, no matter what!). A different sort of music I can't really describe, just listen and you'll see what I mean!"
4,Pretty good,"Many reviewers have already put down a lot of information and advice on this book which I agree with and endorse. Karl Popper = brilliant philosopher of science, and his epistemology is pretty provocative. This book is about that epistemology.I just wanted to point out, though, that Popper did not originate the idea of ""Three Worlds"" as most of the reviewers here seem to assert. He picked it up from Frege and ran with it. If you want the astounding arguments and proofs for the existence of said ""Three Worlds,"" read ""On Sense and Reference"" and ""Thought"" by Frege--you can probably find both articles for free, online. If not, pick up virtually any anthology of analytic philosophy--they should be in there."
3,Book Review,"Bought this book with lot of enthusiasm. Once I started reading it, half way through, was disappointed by the mindless repetitiveness of the writer. In my opinion, it is just a waste of time to read this book and doesn't offer much value to the reader."
4,Recommended despite some failures,"The music on this two CD compilation is excellent: well-performed, as authentic as modern scholarship allows, and wide-ranging in context.The problem is that for anyone really interested in the material, even as a recreational listener, the liner notes are appallingly general. Perhaps even more irritating is the fact that there are no transcriptions or translations of the vocal pieces. Given the high quality of the rest of the package, this is a puzzling lapse."
4,Sacramento reviewed as promised.,"We just moved to Sacramento. Although we are California natives, we needed more information about our new area. We found that this book is particularly helpful to people planning to move here. Neighborhoods, schools, history, and demographic facts are useful, easy to find, and well indexed. We found this book very useful for the questions you need answered about a large metropolital community with diverse housing choices, commuting issues, safety concerns, health insurance questions, and other concerns. This is not meant to be an detailed book, but rather a relatively small book, easily carried with you, as you learn more about your new environment. Our real estate agent gave it to us. We are very thankful for her thoughtful gesture."
4,A (pleasant) shadow of what he once was,"This is a half-a-loaf CD that gives us crisp yet affectionate readings of the overtures to Cosi, Figaro, La finta gardiiera, and a handful of other Mozart operas. But not all twelve performances are winners. It's good to have such a complete set on one CD, and Davis has impeccable credentials as a Mozartean. Yet despite the excellent recorded sound and elegant playing from the Dresden Staatskapelle, my interest ffagged. Everything has the same perky bounce, so by the time we get to the Don Giovanni and Magic Flute Over., I was famished for more depth and significance. Klemperer's classic EMI colleciton of Mozart Over. from the Sixties feels much more satisfying, but that's not to disparage Davis's fine accounts here."
5,Excellent Insight,"A very well written and documented account of how the Texas Oil and Defense Industry have developed throughout history. A must read for anyone interested in how the U.S. and its policies, and in particular Texas business and businessmen, have contributed to our current geo-political environment with respect to the Middle East and OPEC. This book details many years of influence and power struggles which have created our government's policies to control the world's oil and the oil economies."
3,Early Steppenwolf,"Not really a Steppenwolf album; but a live recording from The Matrix in San Francisco of Sparrow, the band that later evolved into Steppenwolf from May of 1967. ABC/Dunhill, Steppenwolf's label, bought the tapes of the show, while it was waiting for the group's next album (Monster) and released it in 1969. No matter, this live recording features the blues roots that later became one of the conerstones of the unique sound of Steppenwolf and illustrates that a number of the songs featured here, would become part of the Steppenwolf (The Pusher, Power Play, & Tighten Up Your Wig) catalogue throughout their career."
4,Sparrowolf...,"At this early stage, the band were actually not yet called Steppenwolf - still having their original all-Canadian lineup which was called The Sparrow. This 1967 gig was recorded before a small crowd at Marty Balin's Matrix Club in San Francisco, and has surprisingly decent sound quality. Worth hearing just for ""Goin' Upstairs"" - a brilliant psych/blues rave-up a la Butterfield/Yardbirds and an utter blast! Here's the only chance to hear ""Born To Be Wild"" composer Dennis Edmonton (aka Mars Bonfire) in his role as The Wolf's lead guitarist (strangely the band didn't record/release his famous anthem until after his departure). The side-long ""The Pusher"" is like nothing you'll hear anywhere else - an experimental/free-form thing that's startlingly nightmarish at times and a bit like a 1967 Pink Floyd improv. Anyone on acid would have likely fled the room! Very cool/interesting/experimental music that no fan of psych-blues should be without, even if you're not generally a Steppenwolf fan."
5,REAL TRUE JP FANS,"Only the real Jurassic Park fans will appreciate this game. It's a good game, but the Game-enthusiastic, little kids that sit on their couch all day will nit-pick it. If you realize... they have to put the first game on the market, whethter or not their is good depth perception in it. They are releasing the better games afterward, so there is more time to work on them. This game will be appreciated by the people who know Dilophosaurus was a lot bigger than the one in the movie, and that the only way that the t-rex didn't see Grant in the first movie was that it had amphibian DNA in it, which made it only able to spot movement. Now, if you knew that, you're a true fan, and read the books, too. These people will know the game's basis, and see that the plot is acually very-well-thoughout."
1,This game is horrible!,"Need I say anything more than the title? I bought the game thinking it would actually have something to do with JPIII other than dinos and the name. This has absolutly NOTHING to do with the movie. I would rate this a zero but that isn't an option. This game is so stupid and pointless (and easy) it's not worth your time. If you want to play it, RENT IT! I strongly recomend passing on this sorry excuse for a game. The graphics aren't even that great really. To sum things up, don't buy this! You will regret it."
2,It just sucks,"Out of the three Jurrasic Park 3 games, this has to be the worst.It has something to do with dinosaurs and DNA, but the concept of the game just doesn't make sense to me. And because of the animation and simple platforming, I wouldn't be suprised if this game came out on GBC."
3,For gods sake....,Its the same movie and video games over and over just with better graphics! If you dont really care about the plot it is a decent game for the graphics and it has good controls. Its up to you-
4,"good, but no cigar",well the game was alright and i think its fine.so there are cool weapons and i liked the graphicsi think you will injoy this game instead of the golf game or boxing games
4,Strong 4 stars! No way 5!,"While I like anything (almost) that has Jurassic Park 3 (or any Jurassic Park's) on it or based about it. I have quite a few complaints about this game. While they are few but major. This game CAN be really fun to play, especially once you get the hang of it. But when you get farther and farther into it. It continues to get quite frustrating. Very frustarating. I wanted to throw the game in the garbage. It gets very difficult and will take you a long time to finish. So if you don't like games like that then I don't recommend this at all. If you prefer a BIG challenge then by all means! Go now!"
3,DNA Disaster,"This game is good, but it isn't anywhere near best. The plot is good and if there wasn't so many dang dinos, it would be a popular game. They make collecting DNA harder than it should be. It took me a few hours to get to the third level. That is to much for a good game. If your a JP3 fan, get just to say you have it. Otherwise, FORGET IT!"
2,Get something else,This game is not as good as the other JP3 games on the GBA. It is still better than Mario though.
2,Unfortunate graphic design,"What were they thinking? White text on light blue is exceedingly difficult to read. This foolish graphic design decision makes no sense and spoils what would otherwise be a somewhat useful Italian phrase book. Why such an easily avoidable mistake was made here is unfathomable. Furthermore, the section of the book dealing with phrases comprises a mere 18 pages. By comparison, an old Berlitz phrase book has 115 pages of phrases in 18 sections. On the plus side, the free audio downloads are helpful."
5,a gift,I bought this as a gift for my father. it's actually fairly hard to find and that's surprising because it's such a great film!
5,My son love it!,I purchased this for my son's birthday. Servo is his favorite robot so he was thrilled. He loves the series.
5,Toy to Prop,I bought this Kenner in order to make a side arm for a costuming group. The transaction was smooth and it arrive quickly. I would recommend this seller to anyone and as well as the product.
5,Aint no different...,"Yeah, I like this CD.. Personally.. it isnt.. THEIR BEST.. Impossibility of Reason is their best work, but Chimaira still kicks ass in this one.. It is better than Pass out of Existance. People feel otherwise cuz they love this ignorant nu-metal b.s. Like Korn, and Slipknot and other braindead sellouts. Pass Out of Existance wasn't nu-metal.. but it was MUCH CLOSER TO NU-METAL than their other 2 cd's. A fan of metal should get this CD."
4,"shut your mouth MeTalHeaD4Ever ""DEath","This is a great cd by chimaira, this is a re-release of chimairas 3rd album ""chimaira"" (unless u wanna count the e.p. then its #4) this is a great cd dont mind mr MeTalHeaD4Ever ""DEath as you can tell his pannies r n a bunch right now from listening 2 to much emo and suck hardcore scene bands. do your self a fav if u dont have the album get this re-release version if u have it and r a big chimaira fan then get it you wont be sorry."
5,"If you have ANY taste for metal, you will LOVE this album!!!!!",This is their 4th and most interesting album so far in my opinion. Song lengths are all 5+ minutes long and have taken a different twist than their previous albums. I'm not going to get as detailed as some other people feel they need to. I love the album. Great job Chimaira! This album kicks ass from start to finish.
1,This is NOT metal.......trust me,"Screaming and roaring as loud as you can down a microfone doesn't mean your metal. Infact it puts you into the 'poser' catergory, which this falls into with a thud. Really, this band has no musical talent whatsoever. They probably took inspiration from Good Charlotte when they were making this crap!You want some real metal??? Buy Slayer"
5,Definite Improvement,"First, before you listen to this CD, listen to ""Pass Out of Existence"". Now listen to this. Can you notice the improvement? I can.The band has really outdone themselves with this album. Almost every track rounds up to 5 minutes, and with the recruitment of Dying Fetus/Misery Index drummer Kevin Talley, the drumming has really improved, and Andols is a great drummer as well. Guitar work is excellent. Listen to the work on ""Nothing Remains"" and ""Inside The Horror"". This is heavy. This is brutal. This is gold, and one of my favorite CD's of this year. You might discover this after listening to this CD also."
5,blown away,this is chimairas best album yet. what i love about this band is their nack for improving album to album. highly recommended
5,Great cake,I've always wondered what a great cake would be...the flavors the way it looks.....and that's why i've come here and we're selling gummy brontasaurus's for 940$Good job
3,Chimair is Chimaira,Definitely a heavy talented band. I listen to all of these albums right before I write my reviews and this one is good. Just good. I really haven't heard anything on this album that has impressed me. Songs follow a regular format of power chords and mad double bass accompanied with a yell that seems to burrow a hole in my head with as much joy as a tax audit. If you are just starting to get in to this band I would recommed The Impossibility of Reason and Pass Out of Existence before you go out and buy this one.
5,not trivium,"First off Trivium is a mindblowing band but chimaira was out long before trivium brought Acendancy. Chimaira is not like trivium, if anything trivium is like Chimaira!"
5,NOOOTHING REMAINS!!,"This album was amazing! With Mark's extremely angry screaming, and amazing guitar solo's. ""Nothing Remains"", ""Inside the Horror"", and ""Save Ourselves"" were the best tracks in this album, in my opinion. ""Pray For All"" started off really good, but the ending really sucked! I hope Chimaira's next album ""Resurrection"" would be better!"
1,Garbage,"Garbage metal - music for the American mainstream to feed on. I saw them open for Slayer about 4-5 years back, and they had about 5 guys on stage doing nothing except JUMPING UP AND DOWN. How pathetic !Pick up some real metal.... like old Kreator."
2,Very Disappointing,"I expected so much more out of this album. I kind of liked ""Impossibly of Reason"". In that album they showed a lot of promise and potential. Unfortunately they failed to harness that potential and took a step back in this album. I'm not quite sure what happened. My guess is that they wanted to try and prove that they were metal. In doing so they have regressed back farther into the ""metalcore"" genre. I was looking forward to this CD because IoR was pretty good and I was hoping that this one would be even better. I was very disappointed.. v.v. I give it two stars because this song has one or two tracks that are slightly above mediocre. If you are going to buy a Chimaira CD get Impossibility of Reason. Because everything else they have released has been god-awful."
1,Pop quiz:,"What do you get when you combine the same two chords (over and over again, for about an hour) and super ugly vocals from a vocalist (notice I didn't say ""singer"") who tries his hardest to act like he's puking?Give up?The answer is...this C.D.!"
1,""" Mainstream crap at it's finest""","Do you like A7X? do you like crap? do you like mainstream on MTV? If you chose yes to any of the above, you SUCK, just like this band. This review is not only for this c.d., but the entire band. This is more MTV mainstream crap, and I wont say they are sellouts, because they were never cool to begin with. Please don't be like my friend who wasted 13 dollars on this c.d., only to discover how much they sucked. However if you like this crap or any other mainstream trash on MTV, feel free to waste your money on this band you idiots. Quit making them more money!"
1,"Yeah, it's loud...","...but that doesn't mean it's good. In fact, it's almost unlistenable. I'm a guitarist, but I haven't been playing for a while, so I only know like 20 chords. But that's more than this band can say. 20 chords is like 18 more than these ""guitarists"" know."
1,Please turn them down !,"This cd its just horrible, they sold only 10,000 copies enough to pay for their instruments lol ! There are better bands than this an example is bleeding through so i think no one cares about a re release peace out."
5,"Awesome, fast, accurate and reliable!",Sterling silver chain is excellent quality at a great price. Shipped within 24 hours and received faster than any other internet purchase. Would use again.
2,Smaller in real life.,It looks real big in the picture but when I got it it was way too thin. And I returned it.
5,Great Jewelry Box,Bought this jewelry box for my teenage daughter. Sheloves it and it really keeps her jewelry all inone place.
4,B.B.'s On A Roll,"B.B. King in the late 60's and early 70's started to incorporate a more mainstream rock sound into his blues roots. The biggest single success of that merger was the stellar ""The Thrill Is Gone"" in 1969. The most cohesive album of the period is 1970's Indianola Mississippi Seeds. It contains some stinging guitar work as well as some of Mr. King's best vocal work. His voice is strong and earthy and he digs into the songs with a master's hand. This album isn't for blues purists, but if you are a casual fan of the genre, this is a great album to start with."
4,Not Your Usual B.B. King,"Although Indianola Mississippi Seeds is not a classic B.B. King album in the same sense as ""Live at the Regal,"" it has some inspired moments and offers a different perspective on the Blues with its incorporation of strings. B.B. is in fine voice here and adds some welcome humor to his piano blues on ""Nobody Loves Me But My Mother."" And check out his guitar solo on ""Ain't Gonna Worry My Life Anymore."" B.B. says it all in just a few notes. But the real highlight of this album is a completely different departure from anything B.B. has done previously. B.B.'s rendition of Leon Russell's ""Hummingbird"" is soulful and beautiful, especially the final choruses belted out by some of the sweetest sounding angels you will ever hear."
3,What price standard,"This is standard stuff from BB, which is to say it is better than most other blues singers."
5,Awesome!!!,The package came with 2 extra condoms! (14 total) I'm very pleased with the service! I would definitely buy this product again.
4,Trio Recherche,"I enjoy listening to this CD. It contains works composed by Wolfgang Rihm (b1952) for a String Trio. They are a pleasant spin. If you are familiar with Beethoven, Brahms and/or Bartock pieces for string ensembles, these pieces will be accessible to you. The outstanding feature of this CD is the band. Trio Recherche is in complete control of the mechanical and emotive aspects of these pieces. The vigour they apply to ENERGICO brings it to life. The dynamics of CANZONAs 1 & 2 are skillfully executed. If you are interested in a performance by one of the best string trios this world has to offer, this CD will be interesting to you."
5,Awesome classic!!!,"I have seen Dan Hicks Live and this album does it justice. Wonderful Album!! You should check it out, NOW!"
3,"GOOD GRAPHICS, CONVOLUTED, CONFUSING WRITING AND DIRECTION","It's as though the producers set out to look like more sophisticated Japanese or Chinese period pieces. As such it's an inferior copy. It's replete with flash backs which seem part of the continuity. That confusion aside, the script itself in chaotic and confusing; it's near-impossible to tell what's happening and why.Pity the direction/editing and scripting didn't match the very good graphics.This is an attempt to present a period 'procedural' storyline. The producers must have looked at the bestof that sort of filmThe Name of the Rose, They should've studied it harder."
2,Will be throwing it away today. =-(,"I'm sad to say that, after 3 months of ownership, this product will be going in the trash today. My cats LOVE this thing so it does break my heart that it has to go but it is just unsanitary. I've cleaned this thing thoroughly more than the instructions say are necessary. There's just no way to get in all of the little crevises it has. I've tried soaking it in vinegar and water but to no avail. It still smells like a fish tank! I may try puting it in the dishwasher today and see what happens. Like I said my cats love it and so I really do want to keep it but if it smells like fish tank then the water can't possibly be good for them to drink. If it could be cleaned more thoroughly and easily this product would have 5 stars. =-("
2,Pointlessly Complex,"This device is loud and bizarrely designed. It has to be completely dishwashed with a filter change at LEAST once a week. Because of all of the nooks and crannies, the waterer grows slime quickly.Takes forever to fill the reservoir through a tiny opening.I've used several different water products for cats, this one ended up in the trash after 2 months.I've taken to putting a large tumbler of ice water on my desk. Very low tech, but the cats love it and it's easy to monitor theirwater intake."
2,Nice fountain - WHEN it works!,"I have owned two of these fountains now for my cats - the first one held up about 9 months before the little motor quit working & no longer filtered the water / made it rise from the fountain. Because my cats liked it so much the first time, I bought another as a replacement - only to have this one quit working within 2 months of purchase! I love the idea behind this fountain & find it to be more stylish & quieter than some of the others, but based on quality, I would not remotely consider owning another one of these. Back to shopping around for a better fountain."
4,Suggested By Our Vet.,"My wife and I have two cats (both neutered males) and one of them has been bothered by recurring urinary tract infections. On the last trip to the Vet, he advised us to get a cat drinking fountain in addition to going to a special Hills prescription diet. We selected the Hagen Catit drinking fountain at our local PetCo store. Unfortunately, the Amazon price, as listed here, is about $10 cheaper, so you know what I'd advise doing.The fountain was easy to put together and was functioning in no time at all. The regular cleaning part is going to become onerous, I can tell. It goes way beyond putting the old watering bowl in the dishwasher. Be aware. The cats took to the fountain immediately, but I still haven't seen either one drinking by licking the dome. In any case, they seem to be getting adequately hydrated judging by the drop in water level and the number of clumps appearing in the litter box. Hopefully, this fountain will be an aid to the UTI.Gary Peterson"
2,Stopped working within 2 months...,"My cats were afraid of this when I first set it up, but adapted within a week and they loved it...It is not worth the hassle of cleaning however. The filter gets clogged and has to be replaced sooner than you would think. My guys eat and drink in the same area so I would find mushy food stuck in the filter and on the bottom. The top was also a pain to click into place, it seemed like I was searching for the right fit every time.Then...after 2 months, it just stopped working.I don't recommend this at all!"
4,Much better than the Petmate Fountain,"Me and the cats enjoy this fountain a lot better than the Petmate Drinking Fountain. I don't have the problems with the Catit Fountain like I did the Petmate - like the bowl becoming slimey after a day or two. The Catit is also easier to clean. The construction is more practical in that the water is filtered before the pump not after it is pumped. With Petmate, I was ending up with a pump full of kitty hair and slime when the water flowed through the pump BEFORE it was filtered.The water flows nicely and evenly over the dome if you just pour a little water on the entire dome."
1,Not very happy!,Two weeks after receivig the the product the pump went out. I'm deeply upset and disappointed this happened. I've had to send the pump In for repair and have not received it back yet. Let's hope the new pump works better than the last or I'll be returning the entire purchase!
2,Great idea if it actually worked,"At first I loved this product and so did my 2 picky cats. But then problems started emerging. It became noisy when the water level got too low, and I had to add water daily to it. From day one the water did not cover the entire dome, only a quarter of the dome had water running down it. And then the motor died after less than 2 months. I took it back to PetSmart where I purchased it and exchanged it. This second one lasted two weeks and then the motor died. I took the motor apart, no obvious problems, and it worked for another two days before it died again and now it won't start up. I agree with the previous review that said the filter falls apart easily and the water gets slimey easily. I would recommend finding another product. I know I am."
2,attractive but useless,"Food falls into the water area (especially being in such close proximity to the attached food bowl) and gets everything all slimy/greasy. To top it off, it was very hard to clean and refill.The cord's ability to detach from the a/c adapter was helpful, but would have been better to have it disconnect from the unit itself so there wasn't a long tail to trip on or gather up to get to the sink.Looks great and the cats did drink from it, but they did not seem to prefer it to the tub or toilet. I couldn't keep them out of the bathroom until I put out an ordinary water bowl that can easily be rinsed every day.Both cats got giardia (completely treatable, but bad times in the litter box); I wonder if was from this fountain.Very attractive, but not worth the hassle."
2,good idea but didn't work for my cats,"My cats do like fresh drinking water, but, even after 7 days of trial, they wouldn't use it. Plus it's noisy and needs a fair amount of floor space. Sigh."
2,Broke after 2 months!!!,"I purchased this fountain for my cats about 2 years ago. Since then I have re-purchased it three times since it keeps breaking. Specifically, the pump keeps dying even though I clean it regularly (one a week). I kept purchasing because my oldest cat really likes to lick the water off the dome. She prefers that to a bowl of water, as I realized when she started licking water off the shower walls- yuck! However, I have now made the switch to drinkwell, prefering to have a quality fountain rather than one that keeps breaking! I don't recommend solely because it is a pain to keep clean with many crevices that collect gunk and because the pump dies even with regular cleaning. When I say the pump dies, I really mean that it dies. One minute the thing works properly, then I unplug to refill the water or plug in another appliance for a few minutes, and when I plug the fountain back in, it does nothing! This product is a piece of junk!"
1,I should have bought another Drinkwell....,I bought the catit drinking fountain over a year ago and for the past 6 months have let it sit unused. It is much harder to fill than a Drinkwell and if the angle isn't just right it only comes out of one side of the fountain....sometimes the motor is louder than other times. There is no rhyme or reason for it. You cannot clean the inside of the resevoir so I can only imagine how slimy it is. I have 8 eight cats and I have two Drinkwell Fountains already - one that I purchased in 2002 is still going. So if you want a fountain - don't go with this one. It was a complete waste of money.
1,"Waste of Money, Do not buy","Don't even waste your money on this drinking fountain, there are other brands that work a lot better and will not give you the hassle of this brand. The design of the fountain is just awful. The blue dome that holds the water is hard to seat just right and usually causes the water to spill on to the floor when you are trying to put it on. The water in the dome reservoir that is suppose to refill the water in the dish does not work. The water just stays in the dome, while the water in the fountain gets bone dry. The pump is noisy, even when the bowl is full of water. My cats don't even like this fountain like the previous drinking fountain."
4,Great Water Fountain for all cats,"I have had this fountain for over 2 years. I love it and so do the 5 cats that use it. Some like to drink from the reservoir, others like drinking from the top of the dome, and another likes to lay down next to it playing with the water as he drinks. Having so many cats it does tend to get dirty, but it is 100% better than the alternative. The filter helps keep most of the dirt and hair from getting recirculated. The instructions suggest you refill the system by refilling the dome - however you quickly learn that you can pour water directly into the reservoir. Cleaning is time consuming since you have to take everything apart - but it's once or twice a month - not a problem. i will never go back to standard water bowls."
2,FELL APART,"THIS IS THE SECOND ONE I BOUGHT, I ONLY BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE MY CAT HAS A LIVER PROBLEM AND MUST DRINK ALOT OF WATER."
1,Didn't last.,"The pump broke within 2 weeks and I haven't been able to find a replacement. It would be under warranty but I threw away the paperwork (my bad) because usually I keep everything and then it just clutters up and I never have a problem. However, I still think the product should last a little longer than that! I purchased mine at petsmart and we live too far away to return it although I had tossed the box, etc."
1,Didn't last.,"The pump broke within 2 weeks and I haven't been able to find a replacement. The water level was not below the pump (aka it did not burn up). It would be under warranty but I threw away the paperwork (my bad) because usually I keep everything and then it just clutters up and I never have a problem. However, I still think the product should last a little longer than that! I purchased mine at petsmart and we live too far away to return it although I had tossed the box, etc."
2,"Cats love it, I hate it","My cats love the water as it runs over the dome and spend their time flicking at me while I work on my computer. Problem is it is hard to clean, runs out of water (with 4 cats) quickly, gets slimy and is a pain in the butt to disassemble and clean. The filters do nothing and the pump gets clogged up and makes this infuriating sucky grinding noise. I prefer the Drinkwell. It's easier to fill although I always hurt my hands on the plastic edges when I clean it. Still searching for the perfect fountain because my cats, and dogs do love their running water."
3,Looks nice but is very noisy!,"At first glance, this water fountain is very fun and looks nice. I have 2 cats who like it. However, the filter gets very dirty quickly and the water pump gets clogged, so the fountain part doesn't work all the time. The water pump is very noisy."
2,my cats did not like it,"In an attempt to get my cats to stop drinking out of the toilet, I purchased one of these Catit fountains. My two cats and generally amenable to new things, but would not drink from the fountain -- they did put their paws in it a few times, but never drank from it. The noise from the motor was louder than just background noise, and the plug is one of the kind that has a large black box which plugs into the outlet; this makes it hard to hide the cord with stealth. I left it for two weeks before giving up. A separate tip: my cats actually like drinking water from a regular short glass that I leave for them either on a table or next to their normal water bowl."
3,Missus Picky Kitty doesn't like the fountain!,"I've had the Catit water fountain for a couple of weeks now, and while I'm pretty happy with it, my cat has shown little-to-no interest. I'm trying to woo her by surrounding it with kitty treats, but I'd like a few more ideas of how to get her as excited about it as I am . . ."
4,first time fountain owner,This is a nice product that runs quietly. My cats dont know what to think of it yet and as I can tell are not drinking from it.If they drink from it ill give it 5 stars.
1,Not worth the money,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! We had this fountain for about 6 months when the motor completely broke. After the 2nd month the water only went out one side of the bubble and we had to prop it so that it would even out. It was a big pain to clean it and I realized the fibers that were being caught inside the motor were from the filter itself. Our cats at first liked it, but after it started to kink out on us they didn't even touch it and we went back to giving them water from a bowl."
5,"Great product, easy to use and my cats love it!","No more fur, dust, cat food in the water bowl. I only have to fill it every few days and I have 3 cats who LOVE it. No more acne on their chins (even with metal bowls they were still having issues) ever since I switched to this product. The power box does get warm, but has never posed any risks. Cleaning is pretty easy, just take it apart and put in the dishwasher. Water is clean, aerated and Gink, Silo and Skittle approved!"
2,How the Mighty Have Fallen,"It's amazing to me that when the original Pac-Man came out in the early eighties. It was housed in an eight-foot tall console. Now that original game can be held in your hand with three other variations.Anyway, unless you're already a fan of the game, I wouldn't bother. To make the characters large enough to be easily recognizable, they have to scroll the rest of the board, which makes strategy very difficult.In addition, the Tetris knockoff they include is just that... a knockoff, and next to worthless."
5,Pac man rocks,This game is so cool. It has all the classic pac man games including pac man for the nes. This will be one cool game to play.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!,"Pac man is a really cool game. I used to play it on my computer everyday. When I heard that pac man was out for gameboy advance, I rented it to see how good it was. Let me put it to you this way: The graphics are horrible, the pac man guy is so slow, theres no music while your playing, and there are very few levels. Dont buy this game!"
2,baddddddddddddddd,"its bad , dont get it, pac-man arangement is retarted and so is pac-mania, pac-attack is fun until after awhile it gets boring dont get it it a waste of money."
4,Pretty fun for Pac-Man lovers,"I would suggest that people who like Pac-Man should get it because it is fun. But the fact that they didn't include Ms.Pac-Man made it less fun. I mean, I think that Ms. Pac-Man was about the best and most challenging game of the Pac-Man games. Besides, most of the games were pretty lame."
4,Very good,"My mom is crazy about this games, she is the one that is playing it!! Maybe because she used to play them long, long time ago...NICOLE REY"
4,"A GREAT PACKAGE, BUT...","Absolutely perfect emulations of the original Pac-Man, Pacmania, Pac-Attack and the new Pac-Man Arrangement! However, I was disappointed to see that a few essential Pac-Man games were left off: Super Pac-Man, Pac-Man Junior, PacLand, and Pac 'N' Pal, not to mention Ms. Pac-Man (which appears on the Namco Museum), would've been awesome to add to this collection. Hopefully, Namco will do a 2nd volume, and add these great Pac-Man games to the collection."
5,Thank you Majesco!,Wow -- What more can you say but PACMAN!!!! I love that little chompy guy. My GBA goes everywhere with me and Im chompign down pellets everywhere I go. Bout time A good pacman compilation came out! Well worth the money if u love pacman or the 80's!!
5,The Garden Museum...,"This review isn't for the book, per se, but for the museum. Located in Matsue, Shimane-ken Japan, it's a truly remarkable and beautiful place. Not only does it feature examples of the classic Tiffany works with glass, but it has recreations of period rooms to showcase furniture designed by Tiffany; stained glass, jewelry, and all in a modern and lovely facility.The museum's location is rather far off the beaten path for most Western travelers in Japan, but it's a stunning collection, and this book is as close as many people will get to visiting. I was lucky enough to live nearby and to visit it several times in different seasons -- if it's not possible to visit, and you love Art Nouveau, I recommend picking up this book."
4,Opella Nova II Amazes,"Written according to the ""Italian Style,"" aka, the vocal concerto, the four Opella Nova II tracks in this CD are worth the price alone. A good choice if theSchein: Opella Nova II - Lyrica Davidica [Deutsche Harmonia Mundi] is out of your price range. Opella Nova II earns Schein a seat in the lofty Praetorius/Biber Pantheon. Cantus Cölln & Konrad Junghänel give one their most exquisite performances, neither does soprano Johanna Koslosky disappoint. Recorded in 1995 at the Church of St. Osdag, Mandelsloh, delightful in its accoustics."
2,Ok but not the best,Read The Complexity Advantage by Susanne Kelly and Mary Ann Allison it's a better book. Or better still check out the reviews before you buy.
2,Not worth the money,"This is the first 3rd edition D&D supplement for the forgotten realms that isn't any good... the quality of the other products just didn't make it into this one and that is very disappointing. This book is almost 200 pages but you wouldn't know it by paging through it, it just doesn't seem to have any real content. Yeah, there's feats and magic items but oddly enough it lacks info on the Underdark itself, it's almost like the book tried to be too many things to too many people. I tried hard to like this book but just couldn't do it. I'm sorry to have to say I don't recommend anyone buying it."
3,Still torn on this one,"This is a source book that is really ment if you are running a Forgotten Realms campaign and want to expand into the underdark. If you are looking for material for a home-made campaign this might not be the right book for you. It does offer a lot of background info about places, people, and events in the underdark of FR. Some of it can be adapted for home-made but most will not be of use."
3,What a disappointment...,"I am an avid DM particularly in the Underdark and I thought frankly that it really was two hundred pages of nothing save for a few paragraphs. I have found more useful information from my old box sets and Drow of the Underdark supplements than this book provided. The maps were completely worthless and the city descriptions were paltry at best. Gone are the days when forgotten realms books were jam-packed with useful DM information ready to pop into a campaign. If you are looking for a general overview of the Underdark then it fills the need, however my imagination works much better than this book."
4,Great supplement for Your campaign,"What group doesn't want to delve the mysterious depths of the Underdark? And as a DM, you should make them go, especially when the grouop gets to be high enough level to cast Teleport, because instead of being able to go home every night, they are stuck in the endless caverns until they walk out. And its dangerous, what with the terrible creatures that lurk in the dark. Fun for everyone!"
5,Exotic and beautiful,"I bought this CD after hearing Ziporyn play live with the Bang on a Can All-Stars. I was not disappointed. The middle tracks for soprano (regular) clarinet are haunting, filled with gamelan-like inflection. But the works for solo bass clarinet, Partial Truths and Press Release, really steal the show. Ziporyn's bass clarinet virtuosity is just astounding. The harmonics in the beginning of Partial Truths makes my spine tingle. Great slap-tongue too. Wonderful."
4,Funky sounds!,I originally heard this album reviewed on NPR and subsequently decided to give it as a gift to a musician friend. It's a great album; cool clarinet sounds. Songs tend to have an alternative beat -- not exactly foot-tapping but definitely fun to listen to!
4,Hated the movie but love the soundtrack,"I was not a fan of Paint Your Wagon. While watching the movie, the songs were dull and boring. All except ""They Call the Wind Maria"". I love Harve Presnell's (also of The Unsinkable Molly Brown) voice. It's so rich and strong and expressive. I bought the CD just for that song. Now I've started to listen to the full CD as I'm getting ready for my day and I've come to love more of the songs. Still not all, but they are fun and some of the voices are just beautiful. Give the soundtrack a chance even if the movie was a dissapointment for you."
5,Fantastic Music,LOVE this musical. I have listened to this over and over. ewkjfjn ksdhvv ljvvjj lsdvfjvjv jksvjvf jvjvvm kvjejrw sdmv sd;fv skfvj wkkkfvk dklfv kvv sdldefk
5,THEY CALL THE WIND MARIA,"I actually purchased the CD for one song They Call the Wind Maria. It is such a stirring number and the singer is superb. Having enjoyed the movie, there were other tracks I enjoyed too like Lee Marvin singing Wanderin'Star.The quality of the CD was excellent and it arrived in good time."
2,Paint Your Wagon Soundtrack CD,"This CD sounded quite ""tinny."" It didn't seem to be a very good recording. But since the movie is so old, I just figured the technology wasn't good enough to make a better CD from the movie. But I have to say I was a bit disappointed in the lack of quality.But it arrived quickly and the fast service was still appreciated."
1,the one I received won't even load,"CD will not load in my car CD player, and will not play in my home player. Both players work perfectly with other CD's. Not worth returning, not worth keeping. Four stars as a skeet target."
3,Do I know what hell is?,"This is the soundtrack to amoviethat, for whatever reason, was a flop at the time. Maybe people just didn't want to see Clint Eastwood in a musical. As for the soundtrack, the songs (written by Lerner and Loewe) are very good. But the fact is, most of the actors here aren't very good singers. To be fair, Harve Presnell has a terrific musical theater type voice. But Clint Eastwood and Lee Marvin can't sing worth a lick. Clint has a weak voice and has trouble staying in tune. As for Lee, his off-key basso profundo warblings would be painful to listen to, if they weren't so darn funny. In fact, his rendition of ""Wand'rin' Star"" actually was a Number One hit in the U.K. Some people have said it may have become a hit as a comedy record, but that's just speculation. Fans of movie musicals may want to get this CD."
2,Poorly sung and acted travesty of the show,"It was film musicals such as this one that rang the death knell for the genre. Overproduced, poorly acted, ineptly sung and stupidly orchestrated, this is a piece of trash. Stick to the original cast album."
4,The best NCAA Football on video!!!,"If you love college football GET THIS GAME.It totally blows away earlier EA Sports college footballversions. {I won't even mention what I think about the PS2version of GameBreaker 2001}.Playing this reminds me of Madden 2001. Like Madden, youcan unlock special features (i.e., All Time Nebraska, AllTime Michigan, etc. , Bowl Stadiums, Mascots, and gamecheats).One drawback: with 117 teams - it would have been difficult to name all the players -- but with the number of 'techs' that develop these games - it would not have been impossible."
2,A Little Disapointing,"OK, this game could be great. But it goes TERRIBLY slow. Going from menu to menu takes about a day, and it freezes for about 5 seconds between each play. One time when I achieved a ""Campus Challenge"" card during a game, it froze for (no joke) 45 seconds. Extremely ANNOYING! It has even froze completly a couple times and I had to reset it. Who knows, maybe I have a bad copy or something. But, the time time this game takes to EVERYTHING, is completely ridiculous. On the brighter side, the Dynasty mode is amazing (of course, going from menu to menu, or screen to screen takes FOREVER). The recruting is also amazing."
4,Great Game With One Problem,"I love this game, as everyone else does, so I won't write about all the great features cause you can read those elsewhere. The problem with my game is the freezing in between the end of a play and the play calling screen coming back up. It takes a good 3 seconds for the creen to come up. I haven't had any problems with any other games which leads me to believe it is a software problem. I also have friends who have had the same problem. This glitch means it takes a good 15 minutes longer to play a game (compared to Madden 2002). But, on the other hand, I know people who have no such problem with their's. So, I would suggest renting it before you buy and if it works fine with you, then definitely buy this game!"
5,SHWEEEEET!,This game is absolutely A-W-E-S-O-M-E! It's like Madden only there are some different tackles and lots of extra features. The dynasty mode is really good. If they don't have a player rated right you can make it right. You can name players (they don't have names originally....only number and position cause legal rights)you can name them and the announcers will say their names. It is the most realistic game I have seen so far..Well some of the other EA games compete. There are only anouncers if it's a televised or big game. It has the BCS and all of that good stuff. I don't have time to tell you all of the good stuff and I can't think of anything bad so....I'm pretty much done..Ohhh. 1 more thing.....BUY THIS GAME!! and go MAZE AND BLUE! sorry had to say it since someone else rooted for their team ;)..
2,Bugs,I have played 3 copies of this game and they have all had serious bugs in the software. It took me almost 2 hours to get through a game with 5 min quarters because of all the pauses and slow loading times. I finally got fed up and returned the game for a full refund. I called customer service for EA Sports and it seems like this happens a lot on this game. They didn't offer any incentive to make up for the poor workmanship. I expect higher quality from EA. I hope Madden doesn't have this problem or I'll have to switch to Sega's NFL 2K series.
1,Just another Madden rehash with college teams.,It looks like this will be another Madden only with college players ie Munchkin players and no online support. Do yourself a favor and try out NCAA 2k2 by SEGA. It looks to be a much better game and you can play your college foes online with weekly updates.
5,Best College Football,This game has great gameplay very smooth.The graphics are excellent.I love the mascots they added to the game it adds a nice touch.Aso it's nice to see sideline activity that's a plus.Like most other games they just have a blurr.EA are the best for sports titles.You don't have to love college Football to enjoy this game.Don't pass this one by.
3,Great game but not perfect,"This is a great game, i play it all the time, I love the recruiting aspect! There are a few problems, First a six minute game takes forever upwards near an hour and if you play 6 minute quarters your stats will never compete with other teams that are simming a 15 minute game EA should address this also. EA still has not addressed the pass defense or the run defense, there's no way the UNLV rebels can only allow 25 rushing yards a game, and then be torched for 400 through the air. All and all I gave this game 3 stars because these are the issues and complaints people have been making for over 4 years now, they need to be fixed for next years version. I will continue playing until then though"
4,Upon Second Review...,"I originally rated this game as 5-stars, thinking that it was the greatest game ever. However, like a lot of other reviewers, I have noticed some flaws after playing it seven or eight times. For instance, I had rain falling on a muddy field when there was a beautiful clear blue sky. The announcer even commented on what a beautiful day it was and even noted the clear sky. I also had Lee Corso make a comment about how horrible it was that my reciever had just dropped a pass when he had really caught it for touchdown. Like other reviewers, I have also noticed collision problems where players will pass through one another on occasion. It does look like the game was hastily thrown together. None of these things should have happened. Yet, despite it all, I still rate this game with 4-stars because it is fun as hell to play, especially when Georgia Tech is crushing Georgia."
5,NCAA 2002 rules,NCAA 2002 IS THE BEST FOOTBALL GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED.IT HAS GOOD GRAPHICS AND IS FUN TO PLAY.I RECOMEND EVERY COLLEGE FOOTBALL FAN SHOULD HAVE.
5,The best college game...,"This is the best game college game ever made, its like a junior Madden NFL 2001. The 1st day i bought it, I went 11-0 with the Florida Gators, its is the best game ever!"
5,Often overlooked,"The Mamas and The Papas are often dismissed today as a hippie band, but they were one of the most unique vocal groups in rock history with great talent in both singing and writing, and, in my opinion, this album is the best example of their gifts. While you won't hear many familiar hits here with the exception of Cass Eliot's ""Dream A Little Dream"", the album shows the band at the top of their game and well in control of their arrangement and production without the commercial whizbang audio effects from their other albums. It's a collection that holds up well today if you've never heard it, and brings back memories of LPs on the record player if you grew up in that golden era."
1,Filled with errors and misleading information.,"Unauthorized (and most authorized) Prima books are horrendous, and this book is no exception.Contrary to what another reviewer said, there IS another guide to Alundra: the Alundra Official Strategy Guide, from Working Designs (the producers of the game). I don't believe Amazon.com stocks it, but you can order it directly from WD. It's superior to this unauthorized guide in every way, with full-color maps of EVERY area."
1,Misguided,"This 'book' is ... horrid. With very few 'maps' and most inaccurate, some even just plain wrong. The WorkingDesigns book is much better in comparison, mapping everything in color, not just black and white. I found beating the game easier without the guide then with it."
2,"Fairly good but has some mistakes, can be hard to follow","This guide is fairly good, and is accurate in most respects. There are a few errors in it, though, and I cannot give a high rating to a guide with errors. It can also be hard to follow sometimes, like giving you directions to solve a puzzle without telling you where to go to encounter the puzzle. The guide can be quite hard to follow and has some mistakes, which is why I gave it such a low rating."
3,"Not bad, but not as good as I remember.",I use to watch this when I was a kid and loved it but nowadays it's ok. I purchased this thinking that my favorite episodes were on this but sadly they were not they are on season 2 which is currently not released anywhere in the U.S. which is weird because I dont know why you would release the first season and not the second. All in all it is good and has nice nostalgia but a little let down. No special features either.
3,A big let down for a huge Dexter's Laboratory fanatic.,"I really expected more for this release, especially with it being never before released in the US on DVD format (WHY?)There are no special features what so-ever, and the art used on the box and DVD menus are the 'crappier' art from Dexter's Laboratory season 4 (The Crystal Skull of the Dexter's Lab series)The only great thing here, is that the entire episodes are here, as they were released on TV, with mini series Dial M for Monkey, and the Justice Friends. I just wish more effort was put into this, into A cartoon show whom's success pretty much carried the Cartoon Network into an era of original content. The biggest names in popular western animation worked on this show, so I don't understand why its taken so long for it to get its debut on home media."
2,Bad service and sizes,"I ordered these pants for my 11 year old neice and they were too small. After a ton of trouble with the company and about 2 months later, she recieved the larger size and even they were tight. Sizes are not accurate from this company and the service is terrible."
4,Large Cooking Thermometer,Very large face on this cooking thermometer. Use for large roasts or temporary reading. Tends to be top heavy and falls over if left in food being cooked.
1,Bubble top melts too quickly,I bought this item and used it once. I left it for 2 mins on the bbq at low temp and came back only to find the bubble window had melted. It cannot withstand bbq heat. Now I have a useless product.
4,Very good value,"It's amazing the deals you can get on CRT TV's these days. Sure I would like a fancy plasma HDTV, but I support a family of 4. The picture is good quality for a CRT. Whites are whiter and colors are crisper than the TV this replaced. There is an audio output plus several different inputs. More than most others in this price range. It is not a flat screen but convex shape is quite shallow. Much closer to flat than I expected and the TV can be viewed well at most angles. One of the main reasons I purchased this unit is the color; black. Almost everything out there is silver. Silver doesn't work in my setting. The remote is basic but has everything you would use 98% of the time. I am using a universal anyway, not the included remote. I have been watching it for 2 weeks and am very happy."
1,Junk...,"It seemed like a sturdy tripod, so I bought one from Ritx for $65. Within 3 months of light use one of the major screws that controls the tilt of the camera is stripped and unfixable. I didn't check reviews before purchase and I wish I had. There are many negatives about this product on the internet. Several on the screw problem. Had I known I would have purchased a different triopod. I will now have to buy a new one. I don't think less than 3 months of very light use was worth the money."
1,Weak,"I found this double CD album a startlingly feeble effort. The compilers seem to have been looking for the most vapid, Westernized, fake-sounding music they could find. There's not a single song here you can't do without. Buy ""Ha"" by Talvin Singh... or rent any Bollywood movie (""Lagaan"" or ""Taal"". for example) where the soundtrack was composed by A.R. Rahman... that is, if you want to be enthralled rather than exploited."
3,weird.,"I am a rather devout fan of crass. I feel their ideologies and music are far superior to many of the so called ""alternative"" music band that exist today. I ordered this cd thru a music stor months back. Upon viewing this, i was moved by how weird it was. It is supposed to be a compilation of the video clips that were shown at their shows. If you appreciate video clips from sources such as rave shows, or what the band ""Negativeland"" might produce, then get this video. I like the tape, i just can't say as though i watch it every day. Buy their music. now."
5,Remarkable sound and picture,"I replaced a $[money] Marantz receiver, a $[money] Sony DVD player and my 10-year-old Cambridge speaker system with Megatheater. I like the sound of the system better, especially the bass from the little, tiny subwoofer. And the picture quality is noticably better than the Sony DVD player. Plus my wife loves how the system takes up no room. The speakers are so tiny you don't even notice them."
1,Stay away if you can,"I'm on my fourth head unit, and this one only works intermittently. DVDs don't play, sound cuts out, on and on. Also, worst remote EVER. What's tragic is that while the head unit is clearly a piece of junk, the speakers are all great, and it sounds fantastic when it works.Now Cambridge isn't selling these any more. No surprise."
2,lots of problems,"bought this 3 months ago. main unit burned out. base cube has lots of ""connection problems"". However, when it was working it sounded great. It was very stubborn to play certain dvd's.(took a long time to load many dvd's and cd'd. i am returning it tomorrow."
2,DVD player skips all the time,"Bought this system based upon the reviews. Bad decision. The system played cd's fine, and the sound was great, but the dvd player skipped all the time. Granted some of the dvd's we tried were a bit old/scratched, but they played ok on a $50.00 dvd player so you would expect them to be ok on one that costs 10X as much."
5,Great product.,"Gutermann products are always great quality, I am very satisfied with it, it does the job it is supposed to do. I can only recommend Gutermann products."
4,it's okay thread.....,It's okay thread...nothing really special. I thought the spool would be larger. I am new to sewing. I can get a 4000 yrd spool locally for less. I will probably do that in the future.
3,76 of 'em,Love my trombone although I don't play and wouldn't know a good one from a bad one. Good starter I suspect. I just love having it.
5,Extremely Satisfied,"I just switched to bassoon from sax two years ago at the start of college and have also gotten the wonderful opportunity to learn contrabassoon. Last semester, I picked up this and another one of Susan Nigro's albums, ""The Big Bassoon"", and I couldn't believe how satisfying this music is to listen to! The last song in particular (""The Impish Imp"") makes me smile my face off and want to get up and dance...and I'm usually not one for dancing! I highly suggest listening to its preview over at www.bigbassoon.com, as it's quite different from the pieces previewed at Amazon.In short, I obviously enjoyed this purchase immensely, and I'd recommend it to anyone. Especially if you're a bassoonist or a collector of unique albums."
2,"Nice from the font, bad from the back.","I bought these things as an additional gift for my girlfriend as she recently lost a similar pair of earrings. I was replacing a $5 pair she happened to like with the product above for $20. These earrings were not as nice as the $5 pair!! They dangle below the earlobe and are visible from the back -- but they look terrible from the back!! They were bad enough for me to not give them to her. Hopefully, I can return these soon and find another pair that will suffice."
4,doo be doo be da ba do ba,I found this record and immediately bought it because of Yes We Can Can that will eternally be a 5 star song.There's a lot of tongue twisting skatting and tight harmonies that really flaunt the Sisters' amazing jazz vocal talent. What's especially great about this album is that they don't take themselves too seriously: these babes don't hold back and obviously have fun singing together. This is vintage Pointer Sisters at their funkiest.
4,Pointin' the Way,"Great Gosh Amighty!In the late '60's, early '70's, Oakland, North Bay Area, CA was the forefront of funk.Sly and Family Stone started it, Tower of Power pounded it, and there were these gospelgirls that refined it.Oakland Sisters draped in 30's dresses, coifed 40's hair, and singin' harmony that only the hard livin' Avenues knew.This is a classic LP on CD. ""Yes We Can Can"", a Tousaint bayou clip made into an anthem, a jazzy version of ""Cloudburst"", and a down dirty ""Wang Dang Doodle"", makes this big fun and always timely.Note: Pointer Sisters in the first wave of popularity were often guests on TV variety shows, mostly due to their unique look and pleasant personalities. That lasted about a year or so...then they made a Country Hit, ""Fairy Tales"" , but were not especially embraced by the C/W echelon of the time. Pointers rebounded nicely in the 1980's with even bigger hits, i.e.: ""Fire"" ""He's So Shy"" etc..."
5,PRE-DIVA OFFERING,"This 1973 collection was the group's debut album. After years of backing artists like Taj Mahal, the sister act tried it on their own. This 1973 collection, originally released on the jazz/blues oriented Blue Thumb label (which also recorded Ike and Tina Turner's rarity, ""The Hunter""), showcases the group's real vocal abilities, unlike their later pop/disco recordings, which, although wonderful, were never as musically adventurous. There's a fuller sound, as well, since the group at the time was a quartet rather than a trio before sister Bonnie's departure for a modest solo success at Motown. As a ""schtick"" the gals dressed in 30's outfits for these first couple of years, which may have helped the public notice them, but one listen to these songs and it's obvious that they really didn't need the costumes, with lungs like that. A bargain at twice the price!!"
3,Things that make you go.....ummm?,"PAGES READERS GROUP - Hot Johnny And The Women Who Loved Him. The book is a myriad of tales that intertwine themselves around the main character, John ""The Baptist"" Wright. Obviously a man who's ability to capture the heart and mind and soul of each woman he encounters in his life, past and present.Almost like some of those heavyweight title fights from years ago, the vote on this book was a split-decision. Those that enjoyed it found that it dug into the heart and soul of a many on a serious venture to save the life of his daughter, BeautyThe other side did not find a ""flow"" and agreed that the lack of it made the story complex and some characters, insignificant to the story. You could really never get a true sense of why these women liked him so much, other than the short description about ""having Smokey Robinson"" eyes.In short, reading this book is an aerobic exercise on the mind, while others may find some pleasure in having to work to enjoy it!"
2,This book did not hold my attention...,I was excited at first about this book because of the cover and the reviews. But I was disapponted when I started to read this book. I read it in spurs and I stopped half way through because it was B-O-R-I-N-G! I would not recommend this book to anyone.
2,Doesn't Grab Reader's Attention,"This book just did not peak my interest like other books I've read. Too many different stories for one character, makes the plot (if there is one) too confusing. The story is also a tad unrealistic."
2,I really tried...,"I really tried to like this novel. More importantly, I tried to finish it. No matter how hard I tried, I just could not get through it. I only gave it two stars because I liked the first chapter at first, but by the end of it, I was starting to get a feeling of dread. Maybe it was the topic of female genitalia mutilation, maybe not. But whatever it was, I just didn't get it. Maybe there were just too many voices, views and opinions, all by women, about one man. No matter how many I heard, I didn't feel that I was any closer to knowing who Johnny really was. Sighhhh. Sorry, y'all, but I just couldn't get with it!"
1,stupidness,"Don't waste your hard earn money on this book, it starts out chapter one okay and from there its downhill. It does not make any sense at all. If i could get my money back I would. I read a lot and it is a very poorly written book that does not make sense at all."
5,"Prolific, deep!","This beautiful book was recommended by a friend and I am glad I took up on the suggestion. Hot Johnny's story (or rather, everyone else's stories) moved me. I haven't quite finished it yet (2/3 of the way through), but I can't stop bragging to my friends about it. Jackson-Opoku's style is a craft, taking me back to classic writers like Alice Walker, Zora Neale-Hurston, and Toni Morrison. Like many other reviewers said, this is not the type of book for lightweight readers, but those who have the depth and understanding for prose, diversity, and patience to appreciate and dissect a serious read. Jackson-Opoku's story-twining ability is remarkable and few can weave like that. This is definitely a choice to add to the bookshelf!"
3,A Bit of A Snoozer,"Here's the story of Johnny and how he came to be, as told through the voices of all of the women who are/were a part of his life. Hot? Not even.The book started out pretty good, but along the way I lost interest and it became increasingly difficult to read. I forced myself to get through page after page after page until I got to Avis' story, which was a much-needed bit of a jolt. I was quickly disinterested again and continued to trudge along until it was finished. 2.5 stars."
4,"Pleasant, but printed song list is wrong","Really quite beautiful and ... tranquil, but the songlist printed on the case is wildly inaccurate, having no songs in common with the list on Amazon's page. I know that it is the printed list that is wrong because it lists track #4 as ""Danny Boy"" (which is about the only one I could be certain I would recognize) but when I played track #4 it was definately NOT ""Danny Boy"". So... I guess I'll have to do some cross-comparison research to see if the list given on Amazon's page is accurate, but somehow I think Amazon has it right."
4,ee cummins in utila,"This book can make you think. But you have to read it after self-medicating to just the right pitch. This is not a novel, a self-help book or a non fiction. Expect nothing. It is a collection of stream of consciousness saying. Each of them is a good starting point for self-reflection or another beer. Your choice. You can buy it for (...) from the Doctor himself in Utila. It is worth it just to be able to see the future: without editors all books would be this long. Three of my favorites from the nearly three thousand:""The past does not always portend the future.""""Give it your max, then relax.""""The masses are kissin' asses.""Did I mention that ""Excape from the Human Race"" is a monument to alliteration.Good fun"
5,...Didn't expect it to be so good and life applicable,"I really bought this book to do a study with another woman who was having a problem seeing who she is in Christ. Once I started reading my copy I realized this book was FOR ME! (I still gave the other woman her copy). Each chapter encouraged me to search deep and tell the truth about how I feel about and measure myself. I am not a woman with low self esteem, but this book helped me to see some areas where I used incorrect weights to measure who I am and my value. Oh my, this is a MUST READ! and a MUST APPLY TO YOUR LIFE!!!Free yourself of incorrect measures, learn your TRUE VALUE - GET THE BOOK! You'll be glad you did.Enjoy."
2,it's ok. . . .,"i ordered this book thinking it would give me some new information, something that i had not heard before- to help me in this particular time in my life. it's pretty generic. i've heard it all before. Lisa is a great speaker, and i have a couple of her other books that are much better than this one, but this one just didn't do it for me. it didn't go very deep."
1,Fine idea but Junk,The feature list is great but in reality:1) I am in a major metropolitan area but the TV Tuner gets barely one channel.2) The DVD player doesn't work unless you are squeezing the unit with your hands to keep the heads aligned.3) The power button is falling off.It came like this new and right out of the box. It went back an hour after received it.
1,Returned the failed player,"I returned this item. I could not get TV reception anywhere. I called Mustek customer service. They suggested I sit near a window or plug it into cable. I told them if it did not work where I want and when I wanted, the unit was usless to me.Dvd playback was adequate.Overall vay disappointing. Do not waste your time and money on Mustek products."
2,Broken,One of the two plates came broken. My wife was extremely upset. She is hopping returning it won't be a problem.
3,"Nice, but don't recommend","These cups look and feel nice. I like the tulip shape; the glass is thick but still comfortable from which to sip. However, I cannot recommend the cups because the stainless holder does not stay on. No matter how carefully I attach the holder, when I grasp the cup, the handle begins to pop off. Had it not been for the poor handle attachment, I would have given a rating of 5. The cups are dangerous and so I will not serve guests with these cups because they would have to be instructed on how to hold them. I am using the cups without the handle because I have enough to think about without having to concentrate on how I'm holding a cup. I use the cups for coffee because I like to see the layers of the coffee and the crema. Yes, at first the cup is a bit warmer than I prefer to touch, but in a moment it isn't too warm."
1,Received damaged,Nice cups but the shipper didn't know how to pack properly and they cups were broken when received. Have to reorder.
5,shipping was great,love them very happy with them.I would like if they came with stainless steel saucers but I love them any way
3,cute but small,"Very cute but also small. My cats are all 10+lbs and they can't fit. My 4lb rabbit loves it thou. So if you have a small cat or kitten (or a rabbit) this would be great. If you have a larger cat, don't bother."
2,Cute but not worth it!,Arrived new and quickly. However it is small in size. It is cute but Cat tneds to lay on it and not inside of it. My kitten ripped the hanging ball off in a few days. Save your money. They do not really go in it.
1,Very Very Small,We have a 4 month old kitten who weighs less then 5 pounds and it is a tough squeeze.....very disappointed.
4,"Most useful, innovative, easy grill book every published",There isn't a recipe in this book that isn't good. I have used it until the pages have fallen out. The recipes are easy and many of the meats can be interchangeable. This is a can't miss book for BBQ cooks.
3,Great and terrible,"Great, because the music from the show is incredible, and the songbook is beautiful to look at - nice pictures from the film. Terrible because, like way too many pop songbooks, it falls apart almost immediately. Spiral binding is ugly, but I wish they would use it - then these books would last longer. And isn't that what you want them to do?"
2,"Great and terrible, indeed","Nice arrangements, but the book itself self-destructed in less than a week. Very poor binding quality.If you buy it, do not open the book fully or flex the spine to keep it open, use books to hold the pages back and let the center sort of bow. Otherwise, you'll quickly need a large manila folder to store this book in between uses.The music is beautiful, the arrangements fairly true to the movie score. Nice to have, could have been a better experience if assembled properly."
3,Rockin' John,This one is about as rocky as JH ever got. For those who prefer the latter stuff I wouldn't go out of my way to get this one. But for the serious fan then this is still an exceptional album with all the JH style and witisism we know and love.
5,Cambridge Speakers,I used these speakers as my surround and center channels in my living roomand they've been excellent.They have amazing clarity and dynamic range for $99 speaker ... you're not going to be disappointed.
1,Definitely NOT recommended for RW fans,"I deeply admired Russell Watson's ""The Voice"" CD and was very excited when I heard that he was ALREADY doing dance remixes (this one, in this case). The song is great but those nasty remixes gotta go. I have sampled both of them, and they're all merely techno reincarnations transposing Russell's voice as if his vocals were recorded 50 years ago. Neither one of them do even a mustard seed of justice to Russell or to the song. Avoid at all costs."
5,Something Special,"I remember the McGuires as a kid in the 50s and hated to admit, especially with the advent of rock and roll out of R & B, that I really liked their songs. My loyalty was rewarded when in 1961 a torch song called ""Just For Old Times' Sake"" was right up there on the charts with Elvis (""Feel So Bad"") and Ricky (""Traveling Man""/""Hello Mary Lou""). It's remained one of my favorite songs since then and I still have the 45 single. Unless you are in a bag, as a later 60s expression goes, and like only a certain genre of music, you'll like this unique set of sisters who were back on the road well into their 50s. Nobody else has quite captured the sound of the McGuires."
4,McGuire Sisters Greatest Hits Ordered from Amazon,"Album was shipped the day after I placed the order. It arrived earlier than the promosed delivery date, and was in perfect condition. My only problem with this album is that it only contained 12 songs. They were all the original recordings, and I enjoyed them thoroughly, however I would have preferred an album that had more songs."
1,Disappointing,"If you have ever heard the record of the story available around the 1950s, you will be very disappointed with this version. The music is inappropriate and intrusive. The story is shortened. What I bought the tape for was to hear the accents of the area in which the story was collected, the strong accents of the south. The story was narrated by someone with almost no accent at all, and certainly not the lovely, unique accents of that area."
1,doesn't fit!,"This sheath does not fit the boar's spear! As far as i know there is only one Boar's spear out there, made by Cold Steel, and this sheath does not fit it at all."
5,loved this CD,heared one of the songs at a workout center - seems to be the only CD by this artist. Glad I have it. All the songs are great! Very uplifting and full of energy.
1,Show ends abruptly without regard to loyal viewers.,"WARNING!!Like so many shows these days, the series ended abruptly without bothering to ""end"" the series.The networks have done that for years, and the Premium Channels have begun the same practice.It's a disgusting attitude of showing no responsibility towards loyal viewership.Don't buy this product! Don't reward this indifference to viewers.If amazon permitted, I would rate it ZERO STARS regardless of the quality of the programming.Choosing to end a show's production in the middle of it without producing a series closing isreprehensible and should not be rewarded."
1,Disappointed,We were into the second season when we realized there was a double disc and therefore a missing discI had to return the whole season
1,All salt no flavor,"When you buy these flavorings learn from my mistake, read the first ingredient. If you want flavor it should be the meat you are buying. If it doesn't list it first it will be all salt and no flavor. Buy the McCormic wet soup bases and keep in the fridge instead of buying the Tones. This was very dissapointing and flavorless."
2,Hard to find the nuggets -- but they're there,"Jan has a wonderful story, and I can't wait to see her live. BUT....her writing style is very difficult to read. Much is in bullet points, with loose organization and much repetition. This book could really use a publisher to polish it up.That said, I found several points that really will help me with MLM."
3,"In person, Jan is awesome....","In person, Jan is awesome but unfortunately I cannot say the same for her book... Gems there may be in this book but they're scattered all over in point-form! This book desperately needs to be re-written!Some of the stuff I like in her book includes the section on how to deal with difficult downlines as well as some simple yet practical NLP skills that she picked up from Anthony Robbins.James Leongwww.jamesleong.comAuthor of The World's First Book on Network Marketing with NLP,""MLM Persuasion Mastery: How Master Networkers Change Beliefs and Behavior"""
5,Great Book if you are a Collector of Magic Cards,"Great book of pictures of Mirage, Visions, 5th Edition, Weatherlight & Portal. Helps alot with viewing the cards for collecting."
5,A brilliant book! (Its not a coffee table book.),"The author has put together the story of mustang with photos of concepts and prototypes.This is what a mustang history book should be.The photos are superb,both b/w and colour.This book has been around for years and will please any ford mustang owner and enthusiast alike.This book shows how the mustang was conceived and evolved over the years.The story is detailed and interesting reading.The author put a similar book out on Mercury cougar too."
5,history of the great irish famine,"consider this book deserving of a high rating. i noticed it is labelled juvenile literature in the frontpiece. however, it is still excellent and is recommended to all ages."
1,Not one but 3 caught FIRE!!,"Amazon should stop selling these. I bought a dozen of them when I moved overseas for a job assignment. Not one but 3 of them have CAUGHT FIRE!! The load on them was minimal (phone charger on one, 60W light bulb on another).DO NOT BUY!!"
2,This DVD had a defect the color run through the faces it was hard to watch,This DVD has a defect the color is not right i send an e-mail but i have got no response as of this time if i do i will redo this review.
5,Flutist playing a vintage flute.,"Michael Debost is playing a Louis Lot flute, made by the French flute maker. He has a gorgeous sound!."
3,A perfect poolside book for Palm Springs,"An enjoyable romp with perfect men with sculpted bodies and story book lives enjoy lots of sex and a bit of intrigue in exotic locales. Unfortunately, I didn't wait for my poolside vacation to read it. I wanted a bit of literary distraction to wind down at night, and this book, like the author's previous works, were welcome and apt.It's a delight in this world of chaos and often generalized ugliness to have some feel-good fiction, complete with happy endings, for the gay community."
4,Benbow not as HOT as in previous efforts!,"I have read both ""Male Model"" and ""Daytime Drama"" and gave them outstanding reviews. I was glad to get my hands on ""Summer Cruising"" because I have really enjoyed Mr. Benbows previous work. Well sadly, I was rather disappointed in this one as it was so predictable, the characterization was minimal, and the storyline was to say the least, a little ridiculous. The sex in this one was as good as it gets, however, there was just so much of it, it seemed as if after every scene someone found themselves between the sheets. (I don't mean to sound prudish...but I was expecting more substance to the plot). As always the covers of Benbow's novels are very exciting (I wish they would have shown the cover model, Brandon's face...is he to die for or what?). I just wish that the story was as exciting as the cover shot! I will surely read Benbow's next effort where I hope we find him back to his old self."
2,"Interesting Subject, but poorly Executed","First, I'm writing this because I always like to read the reviews of others before I buy something. What to say about this book. Well I did manage to finish it, largely because I just wanted to see how things turned out. Otherwise, I wasn't loving it. While I occasionally found one or two of the characters engaging, I found that the sophomoric writing style kept getting in the way. And I'm afraid I have very little patience with gay (or for that matter straight) stereotypes. This book was CHOKING on them at every turn! What I disliked most though was the overall image that it left: that most gay men are shallow, arrogant, sex-obsessed, and self-absorbed. While this may be true of a certain percentage of ANY segment of society, I really don't think I should have to read it in a gay romance written by a gay author. Just my opinion(s). You be the judge."
2,My children hate it,"I bought my son this book, and he told me that I'm the worst parent ever. He then ran away from home and now I have no son and am left with this gosh-darn book.I give it 2 out of 5 stars. **"
1,Blah!,This book is way to american! In manga the monsters don't look like that. Manga monsters are not expressionet like the cartoons in this book. This is more of a how to draw neo-pets(which is american animated.)book.Over all this book is far to cartoony and not real manga. So if you want to just learn how to draw cartoon monsters add four more stars. If you want real manga don't buy this book.~*~Purin~*~
3,Believing in your vision,I am mainly using my review to express the things I liked. I loved the palm shaded marshy fields of India. Where the ground was flat and firm. You can run in the sun. Iqbal was a good kind young boy who I would have desired to be friends with. His family was also supportive and caring. I loved how the mom made Indian food. The tortillas she made on the little camp flat stove in their open air home. The exercise and the water and picnic lunch Iqbal had after lots of exercise. Iqbals strong camaraderia with his sister and his coach. The old rich estate that his coach lived in and made a cricket field for practice. Following your gut and your path. Celebrating with love. Lisa
5,Down home twang fun,The name of the band says it all. If you like hank111 and hancock this is one to add to the collection.fun fun fun.
2,honest commentary ok,"i expected dan severn ultimate ultimate champion to actually put on a great show against the hammer, but he just tensed out. it would have been a great match if the beast was to be unleashed. dan severn has great wrestling background, so that is really a let down. mark coleman showed in the final that he had the superior strength to defeat severn. ufc 12 is o'right"
4,Loving sacrifice and the hand of Providence,I have owned this book since I was a teen..having been taught by the Franciscan Sisters of Christian Charity my mom thought it would be a good graduation present..well 30 some years later I read it and find a book that not only will be interesting to those who have a common thread with this order of teaching sisters but it would appeal to all those who wonder what it is like to be a pencil in God's hand (to quote Mother Teresa)..to see this young local girl in Wisconsin follow her call from God to enter religious life and go on to be the Mother Superior of a growing order..not without difficulties. The love and devotion of those called to this vocation makes a good read..esp in todays world when alot of people seem to be out for themselves.
5,Jimmy Hall,He is great and I could listen to him all day long. I see him on Sandy Beaches Cruises with Delbert McClinton and Marcia Ball. A great 7 days of Music.
4,Nicely told story,"Ms. Cadelo, emailed asking if I would read her book and I am glad that she did...I enjoyed her story very much. The characters, dialogue, and plot were most appealing. A warm story about a young woman going full-circle in the game of life. Nicely done, Ms. Cadelo!John SavoySavoy InternationalMotion Picture Inc.Beverly Hills, California"
3,"Orgin 1 delivers the rock goods, Swedish style","With expectations running high after 'Behind The Music', the follow-up 'Orgin 1' delivers the goods in catchy riff-oriented style. The tradeoff for less Stones-meets-Floyd is more hard-edged swagger of British trad rock bands like Oasis, Cast, and Ash. I don't know why, but the psychadelic nuances of The Bevis Frond come to mind, as well as the bouncy anthems of 70's glam. Does this make it a better album than the SOOL's breakthrough? Not necessarily. If anything, it's shows a band evolving, without straying too far away from their brand of melodic multi-coloured rock. Gone is the mind bending mysticism, enter dangerous power chords. Sweden's best musical export fails to disappoint."
2,Disappointed,"Purchased this for the Linda Ronstadt version of ""Somewhere Out There"" -this was fine, but apart from the first track (like an overture which was superb) the remainder of the CD was not to my liking."
4,love it,"I haven't listen to the whole tape. I have seen the movie which has the music on it. ""Somewhere Out There"" is my favorite song."
4,Worthwhile,"While this book is unconventional in presentation, the scholarship and intellectual underpinnings are remarkable. For any layperson interested in ""The White Goddess"" or ""The Golden Bough"", Waugh's poking and prodding of the old testament will provide opportunities to re-examine the foundations of western thought."
1,Challenging,"Alexander seems to spend the entire book pulling clips of information out and stuffing them under your nose, accompanied with the challenging 'and what about this anomaly, huh, huh?' He had really made his point by chapter two, after which it just became tiring."
2,A Big Yawner,"The other review of this book is obviously biased, since he studied under the author. This book is dry, poorly formatted, and has terrible illustrations/tables/figures.For example, the author's discussion of Strategic Alignment Maturity starts off with a figure describing different levels of maturity (okay), followed by text that repeats what the figure shows (uh, okay), followed by MORE figures that expand on the first figure. ??? This is really poor presentation of information.I bought it for $60 (not cover price of $130) and am disappointed. Frankly, Dilbert does a better job of explaining IT management."
2,"Dry reading, good tools","This was a required book for class, so it's not like I had a choice. This is a slow, dry read that could be punched up with some stories or pictures or...something. Also, the eBook version of this is very hard to read. The font used in the tables and figures do not translate well to digital format, and enlarging them does not improve the readability. If you have to get this book, get the printed version. It will at least be easier to read."
5,A Valuable Reference,Luftman applies standard leadership theory and concepts to managing information technology. Well worth the price!
2,But How Do You Do IT,"After reading about the Buteyko method on the web, I immediately started to breath only through my nose and also starting taking NAC as a supplement. I don't have very severe asthma but I had very bad reactions to all the medications. With just those 2 changes, I've seen a marked improvement. There's lots of information on the web - just not how to do the breathing exercises. After exhausting all the free available information, I ordered this book. Most of it was a rehash of what was available except for the pages on actually doing the exercises. The problem is they are extremely sketcky. My CP is only 8-12 seconds. When it says reduce to little breaths, it doesn't give you any guideance. Is it 2 seconds in or 3? The instructions for the CP are more detailed but do you breathe the same for the exercises? Since my CP is not improving, perhaps I'm doing it incorrectly. On the otherhand my asthma has definitely improved."
3,Way Too Tight,"I have a iPAQ 3150 with the compactflash sleeve. One review said that this case would accomodate both the PDA and sleeve... so I bought it. Have you ever worn shoes about a size and a half too small? Well, you may be able to get them on your feet, but it's going to hurt. There's even less space in this case (for the iPAQ & sleeve, not your feet). Look closely at the enlarged picture and you'll see what I mean."
4,Confessional,"As usual with Jack Higgins' books, it moves quickly and has an intriguing plot. I recommend reading it if you like fast moving spy stories."
4,Excellent,"Excellent read,typical Jack Higgins. Recommend for great summer enjoyment. Always wondered why his books did not become movies. Matt Damon would make a great Liam Devlin."
4,Undercover killer.,"A cold-blooded assassin, known by the code name Cuchulain to his KGB handlers, has been terrorizing Ireland for more than 20 years. As Pope John Paul II prepares for an historic visit to the British Isles, identifying and eliminating the deep undercover Cuchulain becomes the number one priority for British Intelligence's covert counter espionage section. There's plenty of suspense as the supremely resourceful Cuchulain evades capture. Confessional is a fast paced, international thriller most fans of the genre are certain to enjoy."
5,Fast-paced Thriller,"The Russians trained him and planted him deep in the hottest spot in the free world-Northern Ireland. He had the perfect cover and the perfect plan-to kill the most beloved man in the world. Too late the Russians changed their minds. He was out of their control. Desperately the IRA tried to head him off, but he was even better than they at the undercover game. So Tony Villiers of BI, had to do what he most hated, he had to have his Agency beg for help from former deadly foe and Irish terrorist, Liam Devlin, the only one who could stop the ideal assassin.THIS IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE READ IN A LONG TIME! YOU CAN'T JUST PUT THIS BOOK DOWN, WITHOUT WANTING TO CONTINUE READING!"
3,Helps in the Beginning,"This works really well in the beginning but I noticed on longer runs it starts to wear away after a couple miles. In fact, sometimes simply vaseline works better and stays on longer for me.Can't say i'm the skinniest guy though either, so perhaps that's a larger (no pun intended) issue."
1,hard to roll on.,doesnt really seem to work as it is hard to put on. i found it very dry. i prefer chamois cream or gel
5,Just Works,Pros:-Great no chaffingCons:-PriceI have bought this multiple times for while on vacation and it has been a lifesaver. Great product.
4,Prevents Chafing,I bought this at the last minute before a 70.3 distance race when I realized I was out and did not have time to go by local bike or swim shop to pick some up. It came on time and worked great. My only problem was forgetting to put some on the back of my neck under my wetsuit and I proceeded to get a large sore in that location. I hopefully won't do that again.
5,Always a good purchase,This is my main go-to for anytime I'm out running. Great way to prevent chafing for those long runs in the wet weather.
5,Always the best,"Glide does the job for my workouts. Amazon has it for a good price, so I was very pleased. Will keep purchasing from Amazon, not heading to the local sports store."
3,Doesn't just glide on as the name implies; maybe when it gets a lot hotter.,When you try to put it on it just feels like you're trying to push your skin from one side of your bottom to the other ?? not even being sure if anything is put on.
4,"Works as planned, but wears off quickly","I use this product when i run, and I've got no major complaints, it works as advertised. prevents chaffing and rubbing, and goes on easily. my only wish is that it lasted a bit longer, but it might be because i'm in Texas and its eleventy billion degrees in the shade. i'll buy this again when it runs out."
1,More on the floor than on me,"I work in a very humid environment, and was looking for something for chafing. I chose this product because it had the best reviews. I had high hopes when I got it, but lost those when I tried to put it on. The product merely crumbled rather than go on my skin. I have tried in on dry skin, damp skin, even my arm to make sure that I was applying it right. Every day I have tried it, same thing happened: More ends up on the floor than on me. Would not recommend this product."
5,Works great,"Just say no to chafe! This stuff lasts a long time (you don't need much per use). Product applies just like stick deodorant. As a woman, I like this better than the one designed for women, which seemed flakey and dry in comparison to this. I use this when running outside. I wear an armband to hold my mp3 player, and rubbing this product on my arm before putting on my armband prevents the chafing problems I sometimes have with my arm band. This product also works great for preventing issues with thigh rubbing, even when I get really sweaty. Not too greasy. I highly recommend it."
1,Too hard to actually spread on anywhere - Useless,"Product is almost rock hard, so impossible to actually spread it on. So effectively useless. Won't buy again. Don't waste your money."
5,"Thigh fixer!!!! Ladies, get back into your summer skirts!","Wow, this is a great product for men & women with, frankly, thigh rubbing issues! Ladies, I can wear summer skirts & dresses now all because of this product. Smooth it on and voila!, no more thigh irritation. Even my adult son uses it and loves it. I have bought this product many times and used it over and over again with the same great results. Highly recommend."
5,works great!,"My girl friend recommended this to me for chafing caused by running and walking and this stuff works great. I use it every time i run,walk,or bike I highly recommend it!"
2,personal care,"heavy feeling, didn't work for legs rubbing together. still got red & hurt from friction. wouldn't recommend"
4,Body Glide Anti-Chafe,The Body Glide Anti-Chafe worked as advertised. It is easy to use and reduces my discomfort.
1,Didn't work for me - Use Aquafor instead,"I bought this while training for a marathon. On my 9 mile+ runs I would get chaffing and thought I would try this on recommendation from a guy here at work, who is a long distance runner.Long story short it didn't work for me. It maybe helped a little, but didn't solve the problem. To help with the pain, my wife gave me a tube of Aquaphor we had for our now 20 month old, who used to get bad diaper rash. The next weekend I gave the Bodyglide a second chance and again, still in pain.On a whim, this weekend I just put Aquaphor on before I ran and for the first time I had absolutely no pain at all. It was like I only ran 4 or 5 miles.Aquaphor is much cheaper and works much better. Use it instead!!!!"
1,Completely useless product..,"I picked it up from Sport's basement and this is the first anti-chafe product that I ever used. Contrary to all the reviews I've seen, the one I got was very hard and dry, even harder than a typical deo stick. Did nothing to stop chafing and applying it probably made the chafing even worse..Looking at all the good reviews, I don't know if the product is bad or that I got a defective piece."
3,don't spend the money,Regular deodorant/anti-persperant works just as well. I wear dresses exclusively so during the summer my thighs sweat. I was happy to see a product specifically for chafing.
3,"Money wasted, at least for my purposes...","I bought this because a friend told me it would help with the problem of my inner thighs getting rashy and sore in hot, sweaty Texas whenever I wore a skirt. I think it actually made it worse. My skin stuck together even harder. My friend had only used it for blisters when walking in the 3-day cancer walk, and she said it works well for that."
3,Well...,"Body Glide is a great product and I give it 5 stars. However, the product was broken (as in the actual body glide was in pieces) when it arrived, thus 3 stars."
1,didn't like it,"I tried this twice, and I didn't like it. It felt sticky, which was just what I was trying to avoid by using it."
5,No Chafing!,"My skin is extra sensitive and my inner thighs tend to chafe if I walk in really hot weather for a long time. However, with this product, I was able to walk all around Europe this summer and not ONCE have a chafing issue. I've hooked several people on this product! It takes a burden off your mind when you're making plans for a lot of activity!"
5,not just for runners!,"I'm a long-skirt, no-stockings wearer all summer long. Our hot humid summers can be unbearable and I had very painful chafing on the insides of my thighs that refused to heal. After using all kinds of products, mostly powders, I tried this and now I can't wear skirts without it. My skin has healed nicely and it lasts a good 10 hours of normal workday activity. I'll definitely have some on hand from now on - I'm looking forward to trying it for sore spots & blisters during trade shows when I'm on my feet all day."
4,BodyGlide works Great,"Have used this on many long runs/marathons/ultramarathons and can't complain with any experience. Used on ""upper-inner thigh"", nipples, lats, privates, feet, etc. with positive experience every time. Just a shame that the clothing/weather forces you to have to use this product. Not many experiences in torrential downpours, but it does take a little extra scrubbing to remove in the shower afterwards, so i imagine it holds up fairly well. Have not tried any other comperable products to compare to however, outside of Vaseline. IMHO, this product works better than straight Vaseline."
5,this stuff works,This worked great I was useing vaseoline for years at work but this stuff works great and stopped my chaffing problems.It is a little pricey but it works great and the stick last a lot longer than I had thought it would. I am a 240lb man that works in a hot plant all day I got a month out of the smallest stick of glide. Dont be afraid to try it you will be glad you did. Feel free to email me if you have any ?
1,Disappointed,"Having been an athlete. I always knew the deoderant trick for heat rash (friction burn) prevention. When I came across this product, I thought, ""how funny, they actually make a product for that"". Of course I purchased it immediately. I have to be honest and say I hate it. Its thick and gloopy. Like Im rubbing an Elmers glue stick on my skin. No fun, I'll stick with deoderant, much more pleasant and easy to get off."
1,"Good product, misleading seller","Body Glide is a WONDERFUL product. Hiking, biking, long days at the amusement park, motorcycle rides, or just hot days.However, it comes in 3 sizes: .45oz, 1.3oz, and 2.5 oz. Prices range from about $7 to about $13.This particular seller CONCEALS the size, as it has also been removed from the photo. If it is 2.5oz, it's a great deal. If it's not, then it's a bad deal.No way of knowing.I wish there was a way to flag an offer.Bottom line? Buy it for sure, but from a vendor who lists the product details- size."
2,Umm....,"Shouldn't I be able to apply this to my skin? This stuff is SO hard, I can't actually apply it anywhere. I would love to review it, but unfortunately I can't. Maybe if I microwave it for a couple seconds? Anyone else have this issue?"
5,perfection!,"I started using this for long runs since I chafe on anything longer than 6 miles. I KNOW it works because on a recent run I put it in all my chafe prone spots except one... and boy did I chafe (only there)! Will not EVER run without it. Goes on easily, washes away easily in the shower and is basically odorless. zero complaints (except for the ridiculously large box it was shipped in). love it WILL buy again!"
5,does a great job,"It happened a few times to rush out of the door, for a long run, and forget to use this product. What a Big mistake!Since you are reading this, I suppose you know, like the rest of us runners, how painful the chafing can be beyond 15km :)When using this product you can really go the distance and preserve the baby skin on your sensitive parts (nipples included)Strongly recommended!"
4,"It performs, but still feels overpriced","It absolutely did stop the chafing between my thighs that can happen when I walk for two hours in humid summer weather, but I've heard of using deodorant for the same task and truthfully the texture/composition of this stick doesn't feel tooooooo different, so the price seems a little steep. Ah well, I'll try deo next summer."
3,Works Well At First,"I started using BodyGlide when I started having nipple chafing problems, which didn't start until I was running more than 3 miles at a time. Then I started using this product and my problems went away...for awhile. Now I am running 6-7 miles at a time and it seems BodyGlide has its limits. I am getting nipple chafing again at those distances. I plan on taking the stick with me to the treadmill next time I run and experimenting with reapplying at the 5 mile mark and see what happens. I was extremely happy with this stuff at first, but now that my mileage has increased I'm getting iffy about it."
4,No more chafing!,I have been using this magic stuff for years and it is fantastic. It is odorless which is simply great. It doesn't need to be reapplied super often which is really nice for longer runs/races. I am a loyal fan!
4,i didnt think it would work,i work outside in sacramento everyday and i am a fluffy guy. basically i chafe really bad in some areas i didnt think this was going to work but after using it for a couple months now i am very happy with it.
4,"gets the job done, mostly","I bought this product to be able to go on long runs without having the chafing scars to prove it. I applied it to my underarm area and my inner thighs. Although a bit sticky and uncomfortable at first, it was definitely better than going without it. My arms still rubbed a little but other than that everything was great!"
5,greatest stuff ever,"i am a waitress in a restaurant that easily gets 95 degrees on a cool day, so we all sweat alot, which means we chafe alot, sometimes so bad you cant even walk as it burns so much, sweat in a chapped spot really stings. my sister told me about body glide, i ordered some, and i will NEVER be without it, this stuff is the best, hey body glide.... expect a rush on your product out here in florida... thanks!!!"
3,works ok,"Bought this product as I am a distance cycler and runner. works great, but I think it is a little expensive. If you need a good day to day keep ya dry, try Fresh Balls...That's right, Fresh Balls sold on amazon as well. I find it is a good product to stop swampass and schweaty downstairs!"
2,Sticky,"This ""glide"" cream applies like anti perspirant and has the exact same consistency. I apply it to my inner thighs while wearing a bathing suit. The cream attempts to form a thick barrier on my skin which ends up feeling sticky and makes my inner thighs stick together instead of gliding across one another as I walk. I still feel irritation after walking in my bathing suit for about 2-3 minutes."
4,Thank goodness!,We love this product. My daughter is in a swim team and has been dealing with terrible chaffing. She was wearing band aids to practice because her shin was so tore up. We tried different suits...$$$$ No change. We got this last week. She said it feels great. She is healing and swimming like crazy. So happy with this product! I will buy it again.
5,Satisfied,"it's pretty small, but it's great for taking it along on long runs or travel. I didn't realize how much I would need this stuff until I started training for the half-marathon, I think I should get a larger size for training."
3,OK.,"This product does work in situations when you have no cloth in between your legs...so at the beach, or with loose fitting clothing. It does not really help when you have cloth in between, such as under armor or something of that sort....so know what you are getting it for..."
5,works great,I'm a distance runner and this stuff works great. 'nuff said. Put my rubbed raw skin problems to rest. Maybe a tad pricey but I'm not going to take a star off for that since its well worth the cost.
4,"Excellent, but consider cheaper alternatives.","Body Glide works as advertized, and is the best anti-chafing product I've ever used. However, its huge price makes it a very poor value. I recommend trying simple antiperspirant deodorant (in stick-form) on your trouble areas first. If you find the deodorant provides adequate results, you will have saved yourself a ton of money per stick. If that doesn't work well enough for you, then I'd say Body Glide is definitely for you."
4,Must have for runners,"My wife and I have been runners for awhile. We are averaged size runners, but this is indespensible for chaffing. It helps with foot chafing and thigh chaffing as well. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that it does stain. I know they say it doesn't, but it does. It is much better than petroleum jelly or other products, but will will give a ""wet"" appearance to dri-fit fabrics that is hard to get out."
5,a great product,"I first purchased Body Glide last spring. I have found it to be a wonderful solution to prevent chafing. It seems a bit sticky, or tacky, when it is first applied, however, it is actually not at all. It keeps working even when I sweat heavily and lasts hours. I highly recommend it!"
4,Surprisingly good.,"I run and have problems with chafing under my arms all the time. I tried this not expecting a whole lot, but I figured it was worth a go because it was so uncomfortable. I was fairly impressed. It did the trick, didn't feel slimy or heavy, and was completely unscented. It also didn't bother my very sensitive skin either or come off after sweating. I'd recommend this if you have any problems during activity or sports with rashes or chafing."
5,I'm not sure why...,"but I can't go without listening to this for more than a month since I first heard it. A friend of mine got two slightly different copies of this in a bulk purchase from an excellent independent music store liquidating it's largely scorched inventory after a pretty devastating fire (only the good die young). In an act of uncharacteristic charity, I ended up with a slightly charred demo copy. I've treasured it ever since.Having dispensed with the maudlin discovery story, beep-boop ditties like Day Late & A Dollar Short, I Dream Of Ghosts, Cruisin For Sentient Beings, and Help For Your Aching Back move right along with haunting hooks, catchy beats, and ghostly atmospherics. Suitable for rainy downtown nights, many of which I'm sure the creator spent in a garage-turned-evil-electronic-laboratory, programming this eccentric classic.A one of a kind. After the third or fourth listen, you will crave it's damp comfort. I am held in a puzzled sense of wonder."
4,Bizzare Loopiness,"Land of the Loops creates a similar type of atmosphere as Beck, though not exactly the same. The dark humor is at the same time light hearted and amusing -- a difficult balancing act between disturbing and cute. The rhythms are infectious, and the songs are well-constructed. It certainly grows on you after a few plays. Overall, it's worth buying if you're into trippy-alternative-ambient-dub-electronic-loop music."
2,Disappointing for the title,"After meeting a couple from South Africa, I wanted to learn more about their foods and traditions of foods. This cookbook was not about the foods of South Africa, but about how to cook foods in South Africa. It was a very basic format, with absolutely no personality of the culture or region. Very disappointing, so much so that I returned to the cookbook."
3,Parasite Eve 2 is that fire,"this game is gangster,this game makes me angry sometimes,with the stupid dog zombies that takes 20 hits to kill,like you dig when you trying to figure out a puzzle and you keep running into these Stone Cold Steve Austin looking Dogs,the graphics are tight you dig,you got these powers,see what im saying? the worst thing on this game,is when your fighting 3 zombies dogs at the same time, see what im saying? just run like mug. but sometimes you'll have to fight them,see thats that phoney, these monsters are stupid,see you dig on RE(Resident Evil) the monsters on RE are fun to kill,on PE(Parasite Eve) these monsters its best just to run.but heh heh i forgot you'll have to kill them to get your points up to get stronger are you'll have no chance. see what im saying?"
4,not bad!,"i believe that parasite eve 2 is an awesome game. i haven't exactly beaten the game yet, but so far it has been amazing! the video graphics are sweet. i've only had a few minor problems with the game, mainly the camra angle when i fight some enemies. sometimes i can't even see the enemy in the screen for a short time. one of my favorite things about the game is the assortment of weapons i like em' all. the storyline is also great. i'd recommend this game to anybody."
3,Not as good as the original,"This game had excellent graphics for its time and is a pretty solid buy... maybe. If you can find a way to ignore the abysmal control, you will most likely enjoy it. Other than that, don't even think about it."
3,"Bear the patience for an ""annoying"" survival horror.","Parasite Eve II took longer localisation than other Square titles like ""Vagrant Story"" and ""Chrono Cross"",yet the title is a great dissapointment as if it takes only some few months for the process.I'll brief on pros and bummers on this titlePros: -Sharp pre-rendered backgrounds(like RE) -Some of the most memorable stunning FMVs(sorry,Aya's not completely nude,guys!) -lots of weapons -replayability last longerBummers: -Freakish controls -Storage system annoying unlike RE.Expect loads of repetitive trips to load/unload items and buy weapons -FMVs too little,not memorable as PE I -boring music score -[poor]translation(please,Square,not on FFIX! )That is all of my brief review.Overall,not much to expect of this title,expect it like a B-graded game."
3,I expected so much more,"While the gameplay (in terms of controls and difficulty) is similar to the first, I am disappointed about how generic the story line and script is. The first one was intriguing, creepy and well thought out with story and characters while this one has shallowed out Aya and then there are the characters that show up once and you never really deal with them again. It's not a bad game and it has some good moments; I recommend playing it if you're interested; just don't expect it to go beyond the first one."
5,simplemente genial,"despues de jugar la primera entrega , square quedo a deber con el juego y con este, lo paso con creces."
4,Why does everybody hate up on Hide Nothing?,I thought Hide Nothing was a superb album. It was definitely up there with The Moon is Down and is better than How To Start A Fire. I think this is a good compilation for an awesome band!!!
5,Great value,"I use dried chives a lot but I was spending way too much at the grocery store for those little bitty bottles. This bottle is like 4-5 times bigger for about the same price. The chives are also bright green instead of dull green like the super market kind. I don't know if this is because of the way they are dried, when they are picked or the species of chives grown or even if this makes a difference in flavor (face it, dried chives don't taste as strong as fresh ones do but you don't have to remember to water them either) but they look fresher and more appealing in dishes.So, until I can get back to growing my own herbs, I'll be buying these."
1,this is not representative of the music of spain,please don't think this is spanish music. thank you
1,Don't buy,"I don't think that I have to say anything about the game, as it is for a Play Station 1.I purchased a PS 1 from a thrift store. A PS 1 is like a silent movie as apposed to HD.Five Stars for the seller."
5,Buy It,"Gone are the dodgy graphics of the first game and along comes a masterpiece. The graphics are nice and crisp, some of the best that i have seen on the psx. There are 22 new levels set throughout 7 missions each packed full of suprises and great battles. There are over ten different weapons to use in the game so there are plenty to keep the gun totting frenzied people happy. This is a must have game."
5,Same Shoot 'em up but diverse story,"The most lucratively designed unexpected bash of my life. The first time I played this game was in the summer of 98 which at first sight was already an on the edge thought. I didn't mind much for the history lesson and was a little disappointed, because of the absence of blood. Other then the graphics which were alittle pathetic when you gaze at the moon. North Africa, Greece, Italy, and the Fatherland (Germany), are the destinations for Manon. France style combat, with head to head conflicts with the friendly Nazis. Tank, Half-tracks, motorcycles, and stuka bombing raids, are all part of the fun of Steven Spielberg's vision of World War 2."
4,Mission Accomplished,"Great game but I still like the original better. There are some new levels of play and others seem like they just changed the skins on the original. Over all I recommend it, especially if you're a big MOH fan. It gets a little creepy with some sort of wolf men which is were you may stat to loose interest because it takes away from the real historical parts of the story and gives it a cheesy ending"
2,"Slow pace, but some good content","It was a really wordy and long book, but it gives some good insights on why a complicated value chain or a multi-sided market is difficult and slow to sell to or innovate within. The short summary: there are many chefs and decision makes who all need to be united. (If you are interested in the details, read the book, but skim some chapters.)"
1,Wrong subject?,"The picture on the cover does not depict an easy rider. As the cover is all we have to go by to make our on-line purchasing decision (given the lack of reviews), it does not inspire confidence!"
1,The cover is wrong.,"I didn't see the book, but if I judge a book by its cover......then this is the wrong book.Sorry Keith but they didn't print the picture on the way it used to be."
5,Brings the true Christmas meaning to the story.,"The story can be enjoyed by all ages. Shows readers that Christmas is not just a time of receiving, but of helping and giving to others. Wonderfully written."
5,A good book,This book is a good book writen by my teacher Judie Shrecker. Mrs. Shrecker is a good teacher as well as a good wrighter.
5,Great Great Great Band,"This record is awesome!!! Modest Mouse is one of very few good bands that are making music today.Just when i thought that nothing new could be done with the traditional guitar, bass, drum formula, a friend lets me listen to these guys. I have never heard anything that souns like MM. Every aspect of the music is put together perfectly. The lyrics are great, the drum beats provide a good backbone for the music, and the guitar and bass work together perfectly. (Listen to Dramamine)I can't say enough good things about this band. This record is highly recommended, along with the rest of their stuff."
3,The beauty in ugly,"3 1/2 starsA veritable ""meat and potatoes"" disc ushering in this seminal indie band's lo-fi stew of jarred rhythms, angular riffs, and entranced vocals. Somehow the overall talent of this band, in particular the damaged genius behind singer songwriter Brock turned another potentially laughable alternative attempt into an earnest view peering down the brain of an insane, yet insanely catchy group. For all the attention to the off kilter ugliness of everything they are usually trying to express, Modest Mouse's music has always been a lovingly fractured tribute to pop sentiment, and this strained recording accentuates those two extremes very entertaingly. At times the repetition does seem more a chore then a flow, but there is an understated elegance to the distorted strumming that usually keeps things afloat nicely."
2,I Love Modest Mouse But...,"After hearing and absolutely loving ""Lonesome Crowded West"" and ""The Moon and Antarctica"" I was expecting more from this earlier release. I had always looked forward to getting this album and to me it doesn't even compare. Turns out that I find it boring and annoying. Never thought I'd have those words for MM. There may be one or two keepers there in my opinion.It's not a big deal though because ""Lonesome"" and ""Antarctica"" are such great works of art that have kept and will continue to keep me thoroughly entertained. I was so happy to have discovered them and still am. They are the one's with the staying power."
3,Skip the middle,"The album's first three songs and last four songs are beautiful. I find myself, even a week after I've listened to it, with odd snatches of its lyrics and strange melodies in my head. However I think the middle of the CD is sort of boring, and the song Dog Paddle truly irritating. A bigger complaint (really) is the design of the booklet. The artwork is fine but... Either print lyrics, or don't, but don't print lyrics to half the songs, in mixed up order, nearly illegibly in black cursive on dark blue. If part of the reason you buy a CD (as opposed to downloading or copying from a friend) is to see the lyrics, players, etc., be forewarned."
3,"Decent Album; Get ""The Moon and Antarctica"" instead","Don't get me wrong - I like this album. However, for the money, I would recommend purchasing ""The Moon and Antarctica"", which has more staying power."
2,Don't,"Quite simply it was not their best effort. There are many better cds out there that are far more deserving of your hard earned money. If I had it to do again I would not buy this cd. Oh and by the way, I do like Modest Mouse, just not this cd."
2,modest mouse just isn't good,"credit modest mouse for being master chemists.captain beefheart + the cure + the pixies = modest mouse.if one were to take the spacey sounding guitars and the impressive layering of the cure's music, take captain beefheart's theory of finding rythm and musical genius in chaos and throw in the pixies lead singer, one would have modest mouse. the three parts by themselves are great (excepting the pixies, which is a satisfactory listen but not in the same league as the former two), the sum of the three parts is often nauseating, marginally entertaining, and well, certainly not original. this is basically captain beefheart meets indy rock. you want true creativity, listen to beefheart. TROUT MASK REPLICA, listen to that album all the way through ten times and tell me this is better music, or more creative at least."
1,garbage no moon and antartica,i recently got moon and antartica and loved it.It is a masterpiece flawless one of my all time favorite cds so I figured this band couldn't do anything bad so I got lonesome crowded west not bad but was pretty disappointed so gave them one more try and got long drive could not beleive hated the whole album don't waste your money the only modest mouse album that is a must have is moon and antartica
5,A good album,"Well I have to say Modest Mouse is one of my favorite bands now this is my favorite album next to Lonesome Crowded West. I have to say Lonesome Crowded West and this album are better than Good News and The Moon & Antarctica but that is my opinion. The songs on this album take some getting use to I admit, at first i hated this whole album except for Dramamine but i gave it a few more listens and began to love it. The songs are not the catchiest songs but they are by far better then the junk thats out there now. One more thing that got me on this album is the lyrics, you cant understand them so you have to look them up and they have a meaning? what!? Songs can have meaning? I would have never guessed. If you want good music look no further who cares if their mainstream or whatever these days if you keep tags on that stuff then im guessing your also mainstream. I want more albums like this Modest Mouse."
5,Nothing is too much,"Nothing is a hell of a lot to think about. Music by Modest Mouse is peerless, and not pier-less. Buy it, and dive in."
5,There is no other,"This is one of the best Cd's I've ever heard. Its so damn amazing. With out a doubt, Dramamine is my favorite song in the whole world, with ""breakthrough"" and ""head south"" comming close. Only a genious could make such an important and effecting album, and thats just what Modest Mouse is."
5,complex and beautiful,"This is an amazing album. I had owned it for a few monthes before the power of it really struck me, and I am still finding new things in it. It resonates on so many levels: the beauty of the melodies, the emotional intensity, the lyrics, and the subtlety and layering of the music itself all contribute to form a truly great album. I would definetely rank it among modest mouse's finest. It is sad and beautiful and angry and nearly perfect."
4,Very Good,Product is very good and high quality. It looses a 5th star due to a plastic and not paper back.
4,Great toy for your little hammer-heads!,"My son wanted this for his 5th birthday, so of course I bought it for him. He and his younger brother are tough on toys, but this thing has held up for several months. It makes a jackhammer noise that I thought should be louder when he first started playing with it, but I'm glad it's not after listening it to for the past few months.The toy work gloves and ear protection are a nice bonus, because it keeps them from dragging mine out of the workshop.Overall, it's a great toy for the money."
4,nasty game,This is the best football game i have. I dont get bored at all because at the end of a franchise they have a 7 round draft and they let you play 4 preseason games to try and improve your draft picks and the other scrub players that you dont use during the season. Its worth the money just for that. It lets you choose your own uniform colors and logo for your made up team. This game is definetly worth [it.]
4,Mad About Madden!,"Madden NFL 2001 is an excellent football game. If you like football, and you like playing it as a video game, you'll love the best game in the league. The gameplay is better than its competitor, 989 Sports, and I feel I can get into the game more. No cheerleader pictures, like on NFL GameDay, so you can stick to football. The different modes (Practice, 2-Minute Drill, etc) and Madden Cards (reward system for completing various tasks) help make this game a powerhouse. You won't be disappointed with Madden."
4,Touchdown !,"This game is the bomb! It has great plays, great graphics, and my favorite team (miami dolphins) is one of the best.The bad thing about this game is every once and a while it freezes. Than after a minute it comes back. But overall, this is a cool game."
2,MAJOR GLITCH RUINS BEST FOOTBALL GAME EVER PLAYED,"FIRST OFF , I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT 90% OF THIS GAME IS EXCELLENT... NOW FOR THE OTHER 10%; THIS GAME HAS A VERY!!!! ANNOYING HABIT OF FREEZING UP WHILE PLAYING. I DONT MEAN ""HERE AND THERE""; IT'S RATHER CONSISTANT..... LIKE EVERY 4TH QTR YOU'RE IN THE LEAD AND WHEN YOUR CPU OPPONENT SNAPS THE BALL THE QB HANGS ON TO THE BALL (WITHOUT SNAPPING) AND YOUR PLAYERS GO AFTER THE STATIONARY QB TO NO AVAIL... AT THIS POINT YOU CAN DO NOTHING TO ""JAR"" THE CPU TO CONTINUE... GAME OVER. YOU MUST QUIT IF YOU WANT TO PLAY ANYMORE(WHICH YOU WONT AFTER THIS HAPPENS 6 OR 7 TIMES ESPECIALLY IF YOURE PLAYING SEASON ). THE REAL EXCELLENCE OF THIS GAME WEARS OFF (UNFORTUNATELY) BECAUSE OF THESE ""FREEZES"" IN SHORT ,I WOULD REALLY LOVE THIS GAME IF IT DIDNT SCREW UP ALL THE TIME .... REALLY!!!!!! TOTAL BUMMER."
3,Madden 2001,"Madden 2001 is a good game if you like this type of game. I really enjoyed it most of the time when i wasn't losing. I like the fact that you can get a player of high value for a not-so good player. I use this to my advantage all of the time. When I play get frustrated with the repetitive phrases done by John Madden. When drafting rookies I always get the same players with the same names and attributes. But they are useful in the sense that I can exchange them for guys who are on the verge of retirement. One feature I felt they should have put into the game, is the ""Edit Player Names"" just like in NFL Gameday 2000. Oveall, it was an O.K. game, I just hope they can improve greatly on some of the more necessary details of the game.:-);"
5,Close to the same game as last year.,"This is just another great game from EA Sports. Overall the game is just an updated version of last years game. The graphics are about the same with better collisions. The Francise mode is better this year with a 7 round draft! I would recomend this game to anyone that is not going to buy the Playstation 2, otherwise I would just wait."
2,"Oh man, what happened?","I've been playing EA Sports games since their inception. I especially LOVED the Madden football games, but Madden 2001 left me speechless. I was appalled at the [poor] graphics. I thought Madden 98 had a much better quality. The create-a-player mode was nice with all the accessories you could put on a player, but even that couldn't keep me playing this game. Maybe I've been spoiled by the likes of NFL2K for the Dreamcast, but I know EA Sports can do better than this. Just goes to show you that Playstation is definitly gearing up for Madden 2K1 on PS2.... I recommend that you don't waste your money on this one. Save up and buy the PS2, please!"
3,Great but not worth $40,Madden are the greatest football video games but the 2001 edition does not have much more gameplay improvement's.and the cpu mode is still very beatable.Woo woo I WAS THE CHARGERS YESTERDAY AND WE BEAT THe raider 42-3.Stick with the 2000 edition cause it is almost the same woo woo
5,the best game ever,it is a really fun game. it is the best sports game ever.i love how you can go to franchise and play up to 30 years.it is a great game to play and never boaring.
2,"THIS CHILI IS BLAND, YO!","I've got to give Juned credit: they're one tough band to identify. Are they playing dream pop? Punk? Grunge? A melange of all these genres? That's probably it. Unfortunately, while this sounds interesting, it's executed rather poorly on 'Every Night for You'. The songwriting is limp and sloppy; the songs themselves are largely devoid of hooks, causing them to drag along unnoticed; and the vocals are one-dimensional and unimpressive.Granted, they do manage to squeeze out a melody that catches my attention -- but these moments are scarce and end up forgotten, due to how the songs blend together in a lethargic haze."
3,Dale Earnhardt,"I have no idea about this game, but I just wanted to say that there should be an ""Earnhardt Commemorative Edition"" or call it waht you like."
5,Final Fantasy Chronicles,"This game rocks because Its got two of my favorite games in one pack. ....And Final Fantasy 4 was also one of my favorite games made by Square Soft because you got two play as a Dark Knight as the main character!And Dark Knights are Evil so I thought that was wierd, but it's an awesome game!You should Buy Chronicles NOW!....Thanks Toys R'Us!"
3,I only wish I could play,"I bought this mainly for the Chrono Trigger game, as it's impossible to get it anywhere else. Sadly both shipments had a non-functioning ChronoTrigger disk. Amazon was unable to replace it."
5,Worth it for Chrono Trigger alone.,"Both of these games are outstanding, but Chrono Trigger is onE of the best RPG'S EVER."
5,One of the best games ever.,"This was a no brainer. I had to own this game again. I used to have every single Final Fantasy that was released in North America. Over the years people had borrowed them or they became ""missing'. I recently ordered this game again and as always I am impressed with the game. I would like to thank Amazon for shipping it so fast.If you are having issues getting your hands on the SNES versions this is the route to go. I would also suggest getting Final Fantasy Anthology and Final Fantasy Origins.Great games and the price is more than generous."
5,2 Great Classics,"This game contains 2 of the best 16-bit era RPGs. 1st is Final Fantasy 4, which is a great game. 2nd is Chrono Trigger, which is considered by many to be one of the greatest RPGs of all time. Get it... it's worth your time!"
5,Very cool,"One of my favorite games as a kid was Chrono Trigger. This version is just as fun as the original. Great story, great gameplay, and great sound design.I'd never played Final Fantasy IV until I bought this pack. FFIV has become one of my favorite Final Fantasy games. The story is excellent, with good character development along the way. It's really a fun game and wish I had been able to play this game as a kid."
5,A Classic!,"I played many hours of Chrono Trigger as a kid. To get my hands on this game brought back a lot of old memories.I should note, that I give this game 5 stars for what it was and what it is. It is a great story, and while the graphics and combat system are a bit dated, still quite enjoyable. This is an excellent game for those wanting to get aqainted with how things were ""back in the day"" of mid 90's gaming. Being able to see anime clips that further detail the story is a great bonus.Also: I have not played FFIV, so can't comment on that part."
4,Chrono Trigger and FF 4 - excellent old school rpgs,"Chrono Trigger's is a great game albiet the very dated graphics. For me, the story, characters and battles were interesting enough to balance out the uninteresting graphics. If you like old school RPGs, you need chrono trigger! But there are weird 8 second lags before and after battles that I personally could be patient enough for but some may not be.. so beware.Pros+Fun.+No nonsense fluff, just good old school rpg fun+Good story+good characters+interesting time travel conceptbattles that take place directly on the field map, while still being turn based.Cons+those 5 second ""new"" animates scenes are nothing to be excited about, they are short and there are few of them and they dont contribute much, just reiterate stuff..+the delays before and after each battle, can get anoying.FFIV was a worthwhile game as well, though it requires some serious grinding at times to progress, which I hate."
5,One of my all time favorite games!,"This is a really nice remake of a great classic (FFIV). They improved the dialogue, and added in a lot of great items. The challenge level, however, was bumped up significantly. The game was originally paced so you didn't have to spend nearly as much time leveling up. A few of the bosses surprised me this time through (I've played the SNES version multiple times in my day). The story is unchanged, however. A must have for any FF/Classic RPG fan! As a bonus, I finally got to play Chrono Trigger!"
4,The Weak Link of the Re-Releases,"If I had enjoyed Final Fantasy IV a bit more than I did, the review would be 5 stars. There's nothing inherently wrong with the game, it just didn't give me the same feeling as the other classic Final Fantasies have. Along with 6, 4 is an FF that was well made but just inexplicably unable to draw me in (the opposite of FF7, which I got into while I played but seems so shabby when I look back at it). 4 is certainly for someone, but it's not for me, you'll have to compare it against your own tastes.Chrono Trigger, on the other hand, is a prime example of a classic RPG. While the protagonist is silent, the other characters develop well along the storyline. The weapon and skill system is set up to nigh-perfection; everyone has a set role, but Square manages to pull it off without making the system too limited. The music, while a bit dated, is still rather pleasant and the graphics are vibrant compared to its contemporaries."
5,Chrono Trigger Yesss,I remember as a kid (not that long ago) and playing Chrono Trigger on my friends Super NES and how friggin awesome it was. When I found out that it was later released for the playstation I wasted no time in ordering it and popping it into my PS2. (Note you MUST have a PS1 memory card in order to save) Other than this there is no problem in the translation of this game to the Playstaion. Also added to the Playstation version are amazing new cut sequences.I have yet to play the FFIV but I will eventually. These games are both classics and a must have for all seriouse RPGers.
4,FF Loadicles,"The loading time in this game is ridiculous! unless you are obsessed with the chrono/final fantasy series Like I am, dont buy it. I busted out my friends SNES and played CT on that and the battles are so much faster loading then the psx version (and im playin it on my ps2). Just because its a CD based game doesnt mean there should be loading for a 16bit game!"
3,"Pretty good, but not as good as you think","When I saw that Final Fantasy IV was two-player, I immediately bought it because I have two brothers who want to play together with me. The game is fun but two-player mode is not fun, gets confusing sometimes, and player two does practically nothing. Besides tow-player mode, Final Fantasy IV is a good game. Chrono Trigger, as many know, is a good game as well but is not two-player."
4,not bad,the loading screens kinda get long and old but if you are into the old school games this one is for you.
3,Needs PS1 Memory Card to work,"When I got this, I assumed that I could just pop it into my PS2 and it would work fine, like my copies of FF7, 8 and 9 all do. Unfortunately, it turns out that it needs a PS1 memory card in order to work and wouldn't even recognize that there were memory cards installed to begin with."
4,No Surprises,"Chrono Trigger is one of my favorite games of all time. I purchased this set just for the PSX remake of Chrono Trigger with the added animated cut scenes. If you have the SNES version of Chrono Trigger this isn't really necessary unless you really like the game. Fun: 5 stars, Overall: 4 stars (just because FF IV is included and I didn't really want it)."
2,Chrono Trigger reviewed,"I grew up playing Chrono Trigger and actually have written a review of Yasunori's part of the OST. Over time I've developed higher standards in video game plot and more specifically in character developement. If you're looking for character developement here, you'll have to use your imagination because our hero is a ""silent protagonist"".I guess my main difficulty with both titles in the collection is load times. It might be worth it to spend that $60 or $80 on Chrono Trigger for SNES and then play it with an emulator."
4,you're sooo wrong...,"Excuse me, Hashem Omar, but you're thinking of ff5, that was originally released as ff3 on SNES. ff4 was originally ff2. Sorry."
5,Best Game Ever!!!,"Chrono Trigger is the best game ever made. The story was so large that the first time I played it I racked 120 hours. And this is with playing with the story line. The game is breath-taking with one of the best sound-tracks ever composed. It's fun and has up to like 9 or more endings. Also has a neat game function that allows yyou to start the game from the beggining with all your gear from the previous game. Worth more than its price tag,.... FF2 is also a great game with fun gameplay and a great story. Quite reading, get it now and thank me later........."
3,"Excellent package, but serious flaws in code","Both Final Fantasy IV and Chrono Trigger are excellent games (CT could be my favorite game of all time). Final Fantasy IV has been excellently restored to its original ""hardtype"" version. Story elements and dialog have been restored, which is extremely exciting.However, I have a complaint about the port. Somewhere in the port, the code for saving a game was not optimized for the playstation but instead uses a version that works fine on solid-state memory (like a cartridge, which these games were originally on) but horribly when going from CD to solid-state. This is a serious flaw, as saves can take up to half a minute to complete. That is why this game gets 3 stars on overall."
2,Two great games! Poorly emulated for PS1,"Final Fantasy IV works fine and the load times aren't a problem. However the load times for Chrono Trigger are unacceptable. It takes like 15 seconds to open the menu and start a battle once engaged. This game was made solely to make money, and you can see that in the quality of Chrono Trigger. They rushed the game and didn't even bother to check and make sure the game worked properly before sending it out. The load times made Chrono Trigger virtually unplayable. I ended up playing it on an snes instead. If I dread battles and avoid opening the menu because the load times are super long, then the experience is ruined. The same problem (though not as severe) happened with Final Fantasy Anthology. FF6 had terrible load times. Square didn't take the time to work out the kinks. Even though its been many years since the release of this game. I think square should offer refunds for anyone who bought it."
2,The old ones were better,"Here's what I think. I loved the ones for SNES (although Chrnono Trigger was a little too easy). However, gamers who have already played FF2 American (or better, 4 Japanese, the ""hard"" version) and Chrono Trigger, don't get this game. It takes a lot longer to save, it's slower, and the add-in animation scenes and movie clips are very few and short. About the only good difference was in FF4, but if you really want to play the original FF4 instead of the American FF2, ""simplified"" version, then just go to Japan and get that game. Because, honestly, I don't think the new features are worth it. All the abilities and items aren't new, jsut restored, and it is all in the Japanese version."
3,A rather fun EP,"It took a while to grow on me, enamored as I was of ""Keep It Like A Secret"" -- but grow it did! When you've digested all you can of ""accessible"" BTS and are ready to stretch your legs, this is a good way to do it.That or go see them live."
3,The Duchess of Windsor,"If you want all the details about the 'Mrs Simpson' affair, then you can find them here. Personally, I struggled with an overload of information, and thus found it a heavy read. However, details about their German Nazi connections, which are missing in many other books, are provided and give quite a strong angle on the wrong-headedness of both the protagonists."
2,The forest for the trees,"I started reading this hoping to get a true depiction of Wallis Simpson. It started out interesting and then around the middle - man!! - I got lost and bored. The spy stuff and the DW being portrayed as a complete dup. There is a lot of history, but the royal couple get lost in the shuffle. They were pro-Nazi as were many of there ridiculously rich friends trying to look out for their own interests before/during the WWII. Ok they got special treatment because they knew the right people.....nothing new under the sun there. They were annoying, narcissistic, well-dressed, charming, driven people....ok her more than him. Anyway, that is my take on it."
1,The Duchess of Windsor the secret life by Charles Higham,Boring.....did not even finish it. A great deal of information about the war. Pages without anything about her. I kept hoping it would focus more on her but then finally gave up. Do not waste your money
2,Don't Buy This Book on the Kindle,"This book was so difficult to read on the Kindle (2nd generation) that I am about a third through and am pretty much ready to give up reading it because of the technical problems with this book in Kindle form. For some reason almost every sentence that begins with a capital H has the H separated into two parts; some on two separate lines. Words are ""random-ly"" hyphenated and sentences here and there are hi-lighted for some unknown reason. At first I thought it was all some kind of foreign language that I didn't recognize before I realized it was a technical problem with the Kindle type-set. I've seen this before in some Kindle books but not to this extent. This is kind of an interesting book but there are so many characters it's hard to keep it all straight and the author calls the people by one name sometimes and another at others and it's just all pretty confusing. It has interesting parts but overall, I don't think it's worth the effort."
3,The little American Lady,"This book came out about 12 years ago and it was presented in a beautiful hardcover jacket.I read it as a novel and it fascinated me.The writing and the pictures are great.The story on the other hand is about this unpleasant and ugly woman, who stole the heart of a king.Mr. Higham wrote it beautifully,unfortunately she was not a very likeable person.Whether some of the stories are true or not, we shall never know. Like the duke running around in diapers....Read it if you are interested in British History.Sadly Wallis is in it.The Duke on the other hand gave an impression of being somebody without character, extremely weak,and a puppet in Simpson's hands."
3,Author loves to ramble and drop random manes,"Thank goodness the duke abdicated and he and Willis were kept at arms length from the royal family. What a self-centered pair. However, my main frustration with the book was with Higham's writing and the poor copy editing! My goodness the man loves long, run-on sentences. He also repeatedly rambles for paragraphs referring to people only by pronouns so the reader is left to guess as to whom he is referring. Finally, Higham never missed an opportunity to include references to a member of the rich, famous, or political world. Their inclusion typically had no true purpose other than to drop their name. I'd recommend another author's take on the duke and duchess."
2,Ho-Hum and Over-Priced,"I was in the mood to read some hashed-over gossip and innuendo, so this book should have suited me fine. It's long on innuendo and short on proven facts, but I'm not complaining. I never much cared for the Duchess of Windsor, and this book hasn't done much to improve her standing in my eyes. Nuff said.My main gripe is that the Kindle edition is just plain sloppy. Some paragraphs are indented, some aren't.I was about to complain that there were also hyphens in inappropriate places which made it hard to read, but the iPad just synced itself, and that problem seems to have cured itself.Someone else mentioned that Kindle has a return policy. I may just do that, because I think this book is really overpriced for what you get. (I did read the free sample, which was good. The book goes down hill after the middle.)"
2,2 stars is a generous rating,"This system avoided 1 star because there is some value to looking at things in a different way. It didn't get more stars because it was my interpretation that the system boils down to conditioning yourself like a dog, programming yourself like a computer. Sometimes I was laughing at concepts.. i.e. training yourself to associate feeling happy with yanking on your finger, so if every time you feel happy and yank your finger, your mind won't recognize whether being happy causes you to yank your finger, or if yanking your finger causes you to be happy, so naturally, just yank your finger and no matter how you are feeling at the time, you will become happy. These concepts might work wonders for some people, for me it's a little too much new age."
2,Pale and Does Not Last,"I like most Cadette products, but this lip tint is a huge letdown.It does not last and the colour is very vapid.I don't recommend it unless you want a very light wash of colour.Madeline Mono's lipstick is much better!"
3,A Good Collection for Spoken Words,"When I selected Listen Up!: Spoken Word Poetry, I did so simply because it contained a couple of poems by Saul Williams. I'm a fan of Williams's work and pleased to read anything by him. In these pages, I discovered a good collection of other poets inspired by the Spoken Word.I happen to like Spoken Word poetry, when it's done well. There are posers out there, but some people understand the use of words and the sounds those words make, influencing one another. Williams is particularly adept at this, but I found other poets in this collection that moved me as well.Willie Perdomo's ""Notes for a Slow Jam,"" Suheir Hammad's ""Nother Man Dead,"" and Ava Chin's ""Piano Concerto"" are some of my favorites. But it is Williams, in his three part ""Children of the Night,"" that really sold this book for me.Not every poem, or even every poet, in this collection captures my imagination. Even so, it is a good collection to own, and better to share."
3,Good Primer on Homebrewing,"This book was given to me as a gift, and it helped me to get started in homebrewing. A good introduction to the mechanics of homebrewing. But as the first reviewer suggested above, the author is a bit paranoid. For a first-timer, I'd probably reccommend Papazian's guides as a better place to start. It's a little more easygoing and makes for a more interesting read."
5,The ultimate still lives.,"I was given this book as a present over ten years ago. I could not imagine, nor have I seen, a better book. It covers every level of brewing you could want to try in easy terms. All levels from processed ingredients to true 'from scratch' cooking. If you can cook, this is the book. If the book seems thin or small, that is because brewing is that simple. It's a fair amount of work, but it is that easy."
2,Relax do not buy this book have a homebrew instead,"I am not at all impressed with this book. very uptight and the information is written for the extreme paranoid. I have been unable to read passed the first chapter.With 40 books on beer and homebrewing to compare this one rates almost as low as that rating guide by that Englishman (not Micheal Jackson). I learned more from the first few pages of Papazian the new complete joy of homebrewing.For good and to the point informaion read Papazian. It reads like a novel and is fun to booth. It came highly recommended and now I see why.Other goods books: Beer: Tap into the art and science of Brewing, Charles Bamforth The Classic beerstyle series is not bad either. And on a more advanced level Principles of brewing science is also very good and very readable."
1,Flimsy,"I loved the look of this pot and was excited to cook in what looked like a quality product. I followed the instructions but when I cooked my fish in it the darn thing warped on the bottom!! It never got above medium and it still warped.Junk, junk, junk."
3,Red Sonja is pure male entertainment,"This trade paperback by Dynamite is listed as vol 1 and features a storyline plot of Red Sonja going to a city, encounters a wizard, joins in the resistance to overthrow the wizard and, in the process, lays waste to the entire city. Not much variation on the familiar sword and sorcery genre.I just prefer this Red Sonja to the earlier Thorne series. This latter Red Sonja is really nubile, a true amazon surrounded by the most brutish males ever drawn outside of Kubert and Buscema. Aside from that, the plot lines really need to improve to be on a par with the magnificent revival Carey Nord series featuring Conan the Barbarian."
1,Wrong Title Also,"I ordered this in March. Got the wrong title twice! Got a refund. No one at Amazon is monitoring this, even though I explicitly asked them to do so."
3,Has this been cleared up yet?,Has Amazon sorted the issue between Marvels RS vol 1 and Dynamites' RS vol 1?Now that the Dynamites RS vol 1 has (finally) been released.
1,"I, too, received the wrong item from Amazon.","I don't know if Amazon is listing this book incorrectly or what, but I'm returning my copy, as many others have apparently done."
2,A Disappointment,"""The Adventures of King Midas"" promised to be a great book. After all, with a classic story like that and the author of the wonderful ""Indian in the Cupboard"" series, how could you go wrong? Apparently, you could. Reid's book tried to be a page-turning fantasy, but you just can't get very excited about what will happen next. True, it wasn't horrible to read, but it just didn't live up to it's potential. One problem was that Reid did not really develop her character's as much as she does in her other books. She fails to bring out the magic that is just dying to get out. Although it was not the worst book I've read, it sure could've been a whole lot better."
3,It just keeps getting worse,"Finally, Gaia get together! But then As usual they cant betoigether because any one colse go her gets hurt. Whyt she couldnt just tell him that though instead of lying to him. Things just get worse for her, I hope that some thing good happens to her soon because other wise its just gonna start getting boring."
3,Odd Answers Only...,"I purchased the solutions manual along with the textbook, hoping it would help me grade myself as I re-teach myself chemistry (have not taken a chemistry class in over 5 years). Unfortunately, this book has only the answers to the odd problems. Amazon.com did not report this in the item description, so I feel a little ripped-off right now. In my opinion, the current price is too much for a book with only half the solutions.I intend to keep the book, since I have not immediately found any with the full set of solutions, so I hope the odd problems will help me correct any misunderstandings I have!If you are looking for the full set of solutions for self-instruction or tutoring, this is not the product for you! Perhaps you should look for a teacher's edition to this book (should one exist)."
1,Horrible Service,"I would never purchase anything from this seller again. Not only did I never receive my product after I spent $41 dollars on it, they never answered my complaint. If you are thinking about buying anything from this retailer, I would think twice about it. Not only will you be wasting your money, but you are also wasting your time."
5,"Durable, discreet, comfortable","I bought this for my 12 pound cat, and it was a good fit for him, but I think he could have comfortably fit in the small one too. My vet said cats usually prefer a tighter fit so they feel more secure. It comes with removable pads, so it can work for a range of pet sizes. My cat took to it very quickly, and even still uses it as a little cave when he's cold or scared. It fit perfectly under the airplane seats, and most people had NO idea that I had a cat in it. I got some strange looks when I was talking to my cat in the bag:POverall, it is very durable, stylish and comfortable. I'm really glad I spent the extra money on this rather than a cheap one. Another woman on my plane had a cat in a cheap carrier, and it really looked miserable, as did she. She even commented on how she wished she had bought one like mine instead!"
2,Airline carrier,"I purchased the medium size for a toy poodle (8 lbs). It was too small so I had to return and purchase the large which was perfect. I recommend that if you have a dog over the size of 8 lbs you should purchase the large carrier.Teafco Argo Airline Approved Medium Aero Pet Carrier, Lime Green"
5,Great carrier for flying with your cat,I picked this one out based on other reviews. I was quite happy with it and so was Ravi Shankar the Cat! I think it's a little overpriced but the comfort of my cat was all I was concerned about. The carrier also fit quite nicely under the seat.
1,Waste of time,"This book is trash. Its premise is idiotic and its science doubly so. The plot is incoherent and the writing is turgid. About the only use this book has is ""filling in the blanks"" about American military capability to those with a good basic knowledge of same. For those unfamiliar with military terminology, much of the book will be incomprehensible. The global warming ""science"" in the book, its central premise, reads straight out of the doomsday, envirowhacko crowd. If one wishes to immerse himself in the military techno-thriller genre, there are far better authors: Clancy, Robinson, Coonts, Marcinko, not to mention masters of international intrigue such as Frederick Forsythe, Alistair MacLean and Robert Ludlum. Woulfe obviously is trying to make a buck on the public's renewed interest in military matters post 9/11. Reading his book is a complete waste of time."
1,"Preachy, shallow and lifeless","There's plenty of other much better military fiction out there, don't waste your time with this one. The characters are stock, most of the book is exposition instead of action, the premise isn't believable, and given that the real situation is on TV every day, it's easy to see that this book misses the mark. It's a right-wing polemic disguised as an action story; I can enjoy both of those, but this a lousy attempt at either of them."
2,2nd Philips CD player to die an untimely death,"My first Philips boombox (AZ2045) had amazing sound. That one died when the CD player stopped recognizing disks. I figured it was a fluke. I was mistaken. This AZ1837 died in a similar fashion but never had the same sound quality. It was, however, significantly more compact and easy to use."
4,"Sound quality quite good, but a bit quirky","The unit is smaller than I thought after looking at the picture, but the sound quality is quite good. I have not yet tried the MP3 capability or the ripping. The remote is very nice to have for the baby's room.The unit gets stays warm as long as it's plugged in, and even after it ""auto shuts-off"" when the disc finishes.As the other reviewer does, I miss a sleep timer, since we are using this for a baby's room. Also, why no volume control on the remote. Silly."
1,No iPods allowed!,"I bought this model because of its ""Direct USB"" connection. Don't let that fool you. The USB in this unit only works if you let this machine record the songs from a CD onto a standard flash drive using its own software. iPods and other MP3 players don't work with it, regardless of the manufacturer's claims. Very deceptive advertising."
2,Product Misrepresentation,I have returned the product as it did not perform as advertized. Capital Electronics was very difficult to work with on the return and would only allow 85% credit on the item when returned. Amazon has agreed to give full credit on the item. As of this review I have not received a credit card bill since the return to verify I received full credit.
5,Master's touch,"I can't express the fluid mastery that this recording shows any where near as well as the other reviewers have. I can only say that they are right on, this is a wonderful CD, and if you have any interest in this sort of thing, you won't be dissapointed. He has a touch on the strings that is deft and graceful, and it took a while to notice, because his technique brings the music to the forefront, not the artist. Perhaps there could be a bit more personality (think Christopher Parkening), but this is definitely not a criticism! Currently this is my favorite classical album, and I look forward to seeing his considerable talents develop."
4,pleasantly surprised,"i just ordered this bottle (90) about 2 months ago. i take the pill before any meal i eat a day, which is only about 2. but i take one if i have a snack. the directions says 3 times a day. i was pretty open minded especially from reading reviews on it. i have recently loss about 10 lbs. i also excercise and try to diet. but i believe that this has helped me not return back to my old weight. i have not had any bad side effects and would reccommend this to someone looking. as far as cellulite goes, it has become minimal."
3,It's OK,"I've been on Herbalife Cell-U-Loss for more than a month now. In conjunction with Herbalife Formula 1 Shake, Protein Shake, Cell Activator and the Herbalife tea, I havent lost weight. On top of the Herbalife products I have been going to the gym 3-4 times a week alternating cardio and core resistance training. I have only lost 2 pounds, I've seen it work for my peers so I can't say it's a bad product. But at least for me it's not effective."
3,Shipped quick have not tried it yet.,I Received this product a few days after ordering didnt take long at all. I can't wait to try this product out!
4,Pretty good,"Very good for cellulite but no effect on weight loss. It worked well for me since my goal was the cellulite only but if you're buying as a support for weight loss, I wouldn't recommend"
2,cell u loss,This product made me feel nauseated. It does make you have bowel movements. I wanted this product to aide in weight loss couldn't really see the end resultsbecause I had to stop taking it because of the side affects.
1,wrong label,the label photo for this product is not accurate. Very confusing....i thought i was ordoring one product and got another one instead.
1,Editing/Directing Ruins the action,"The only reason to watch a movie of this genre is so that you can SEE the fighting scenes. The director's weak attempt to make it exciting with closeups and a shakey camera makes it impossible to see what is going on in the fighting scenes. Camera shakes, close up of face, close up of hand, close up of blood, guy on ground?!? Might as well used stop motion with dummies. Seen better fight scenes on youtube. Total waste of time."
2,Don't bother...,"Is more of an steve austin movie than seagal. seagal is just there for his name recognition, although he's not that good an actor to begin with, I'm not a fan of steve austin, or any of these wrestlers wanting to get into the business. I wanted to see it, mostly for seagal, but he didn't have much of a part in this and when he moved he looked like he was an 80 year old man. they both, seem to be reading their script from a card placed in front of him, even though can't even call it a script. there were times, where neither one, knew how to continue a conversation, related to the plot, other than ""I hear ya, brother""!!."
2,Awful,I don't understand why these movies have to be as bad as they are. With just a little effort they can be made much better with better editing and directing. I don't even think more money is required.
1,Dire,Unconvincing action and unrealistic plot filled with holes and poor acting.Steven Seagal is past his sell-by date - does not even look convincing any more.
1,Ugly,"If you already the old, fat and ugly actor, there are still a way how to make a nice movie - play old, fat and ugly character. To see, how Steven Seagal try to play the Commando, is very sad."
3,Movie is ok.,Alot of action and I pretty much like everything with Steven Seagal. This is another bang um up movie. Entertaining if you like Seagal.
3,was ok for low budget m=but not enough fights too much guns,like i said it was ok for low budget but no one wants to see stone cold use guns you wanna see him use some of his wrestling moves and you dont in this and same old steven seagul never even gets hit
4,actionman,held my interest thanks Mr. Seagal & Austin I'll be looking for either one of your movies to come out.
3,Standard Seagal Action Movie with Austin as Bonus,This is a simple script shoot'em up kind of Seagal direct to video movie. If you like both actors or at least one and can tolerate DOV style movies then you will like this. The action scenes are very good. Lots of bullets in this movie.
5,Bought it as a package,Again you folks had just what I wanted! I wasn't expecting two of my favorite Bobby albums on one disc but it was great being able to kick back and listen to a blast from my past! Kudos once again to Amazon. You guys are great!
1,Heavily preachy,"I did not like the tone of the book, even though it does contain some good tips. However, over half of the tips are items like ""Say a prayer"", and ""Give praise"" and ""Hold hands"". Huh?I expected an interior decoration type book. What this is is a lifestyle book - how to provide materials to enhance your five senses at home (which is where the 505 number comes from - it contains 101 tips per sense).So if you are looking for an interior decoration book, this is probably not the book you are looking for."
1,"About as historically accurate as ""My Darling Clementine""","This badly produced DVD barely skims the surface of Holliday's life. You cannot delve too deeply in a 50 minute program; but you can try. The makers of this program barely did that. Many of the supposed facts are inaccurate. This program says he left Georgia breaking off his engagement to his first cousin, Mattie. There is no evidence they were engaged. The re-enactments are poorly done. All in all, just a poorly made film.Take the money you would have spent on this and buy a good book biography instead."
5,It 's a road of excellent music and life memories together,"It is a wonderful album, the combination of the songs is wonderful, i would love to buy it, I have almost all his albums, but this combination is amazing!!!!"
3,Understanding Wittgenstein from his early approach to logic,"In Introduction, Hutto, professor of Philosophical Psychology of University of Hertfordshire, explains his motive to write a book about Tractatus. We gain a powerful grasp of Wittgenstein's later philosophy by analyzing his approach to logic in the Tractatus, as his essential method was retained throughout his life. Although I never understood clearly what aspect of his method is ""novel"" (considering there are already more than dozens books that take similar approach to Wittgenstein's philosophy), I found some chapter has an interesting topic. The book has a well-organized note, reference and index.Book description:Text (221 pages) Note (22p), References (8p) Index (9p). Chapter 1 ""A focus on logic"", Chapter 2 ""Just the Facts?"", Chapter 3 ""Seeking Clarity Throughout"", Chapter 4 ""Without Explanation"", Chapter 5 ""Before Realism and Idealism"", Chapter 6 ""Description Alone""."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this after it was recommended to me by a friend. I was really disappointed. The A-Z choices for words, in my opinion, were very poorly picked and put together. I initially expected to be able to look up almost any word and have a reference to scriptures that would support that word. I was wrong. I have had it for about a year and used it maybe twice. I will be looking for another one because this one is not doing much but occupying a space on my bookshelf."
5,What Does The Bible Say About...The Ultimate A To Z Resource,"Bought one for each of our children to use as a reference when they have a question about an issue they are facing. We use a copy at home, and both children are moving away for college. I think this is a wonderful resource, and important enough that I bought them each their own copy."
3,It's not what I was looking for.,"I really wanted to buy the book Where to find it in the bible from A to Z. But I bought this book by mistake. It is okay, but the other book has more info."
3,Sky Diving with nukes,The reason I ordered this book was to read the this soldier's account of parachuting with a nuclear device rigged to his parachute harness/container and dropping into a DZ at Fort Bragg. Pretty interesting. Well worth the 1 cent plus shipping I paid for it.
5,vietnam still haunts,"After all these years, i still am haunted about the American war in Vietnam and ""Code Name Copperhead"" is another source of bringing old memories to the front. Thirty three years after returning from Vietnam I wrote about my experiences as a surgeon and company commander in that war, ""Delta Six, Soldier Surgeon"". I was writing about guys like Sergeant Major Joe R. Garner, men who did their job with honor, dignity, and skills that were legendary. Thank you Joe, for what you did for us, and I am sorry you didn't get the post duty accolades you deserved. Unlike other wars, the soldiers returning from the battlefields of ""The Nam"" seemed to be blamed for the war.You told it like it was and always will be. We are proud of what we did for our country even though it seemed thankless at the time. God bless you Joe.Rick SniderAuthor ""Delta Six, Soldier Surgeon"""
4,Interesting Book,It has been awhile since I read this book but it was very interesting at the time. I read the book while I was still in the Army and could relate to its author.
3,Quick easy read,Good book. Quick easy read. Something that is light and engaging. Colorful and romantic. Strong woman lead. Love the kindle daily deals.
5,AWESOME!,I loved this book. Sophia and Tobin were perfect for each other. I do believe that this is my favorite Jill Barnett book so far. I enjoyed it very much.
2,Not up to Barnett's previous standards,"I have read all of Jill Barnett's books and was eagerly awaiting this one but was disappointed in it, coming away feeling as if these characters were not fully developed. The humor was not up to par either for Ms. Barnett. Sofia and Tobin were great looking but that seems to be all that was important about these two. Tobin never understood what really made Sofia tick-her fear of abandonment, her dread of waiting for the men she loved-at least this was never brought out in dialogue. The two of them were flat and lacking in compassion most of the time. I wouldn't tell someone not to read Wicked, but think Ms. Barnett has done better developing her ""inner"" characters in past reads."
5,ONE BOOK I WILL NEVER FORGET!!!,"I truly enjoyed this novel. Mostly because I am able to relateto it in many ways. I could never put into words the way this booktouched me. I was hooked with the first paragraph and could not put it down. I did not want for the book to come to an end because I wanted to keep experiencing the intense passion between Lady Sofia and Tobin de Clare. That passion that is so rare in true life. But does exist, and should be experienced and savored. I really liked the way the author used the contrast of humor and passion. It worked well and was an added touch to the journey of Tobin and his Betrothed. I am thankful this is the book I chose in just an instant."
4,3.5 stars,This was the first Jill Barnett book I read. I was either smiling or laughing through the first half. This was more comedy than romance. It was hard for me to like Tobin after the wager he made at the beginning and I'm not sure if I ever got over it. It actually made me wonder why Sophia thought she loved him. He hadn't really done anything to deserve it. Arrogance is not a good reason to love someone. Even with the lack of romance I will definitely read more of Barnett's books.
4,Great Series,Start with Wonderful and work your way here. An old fashioned bodice ripper series but so much fun I read them straight through.
4,I loved this book.,I'm not generally a romance novel type of reader. I bought this on a whim when it was one of the Deals of the Day. I'm glad I did. The story and characters kept me completely captivated until the very end.
4,Read the series,"Had read the other books in the series and wanted to read this one too. Enjoyed the story, recommend it."
4,a good read,"I thought this was a really good book, it was one of those that actually makes a reader feel a bit for the characters rather than feeling like they are just reading a story. The only complaint I really have is that is seems that the characters never really truly know each other, which is necessary for true love. The love at first sight thing needs to be resolved with a true knowledge of the other person. However, they understand each other's basic personalities and drives and it is a good read overall. I recommend this book as a good read and I look forward to reading more by Jill Barnett."
5,Just like the title suggests..it is WICKED!,"I've read Wonderful and Wild and I loved both those books but Wicked is the best. I don't care if as one reader said there were events w/c were far-fetched but it was so beautifully woven together into a truly entertaining, enjoyable and unforgettable story. The book had me laughing out loud at times and in some scenes had tears in my eyes and for me that spells...good..wonderful reading material. My only complain is the numerous typo errors that I found in the book... otherwise it is PERFECT!"
5,Really good!,"I LOVED this book! It made me laugh.... a lot. I felt like it was one big emotional roller coaster of the best kind. It was funny, serious, tragic, romantic, and sexy. These two are so stubborn and it makes for a really lively romance. Tobin, in particular really frustrated me but you know deep down he's a good guy so you keep giving him a chance to make it right. :) I will be looking for other good titles from this author."
1,Yuck!,"I could not get past what the hero, Tobin de Clare, did to the heroine. He humiliated her in front of his friends on a cruel bet. Later on, he gets himself betrothed to her without winning her forgiveness first. Sofia would have been better off without him and I did not think he deserved her. He showed absolutely no consideration for her feelings, and no remorse for the humiliating things that he did to her. If you want to read a good medieval romance, read her other two medievals Wonderful and Wild, but leave this one alone."
5,ohh so funnnnny,"i never expected to enjoy this book, coz the characters were so young, but i have to say i was pleasantly surprised sophia and tobin made me laugh with their funny retorts from start to finish, i could not put this book down and i would recommend it, especially if you need a little cheering up this is just the book for you."
3,It's ok.,I love to read historical type novels. It was a very loosely based book with a very predictable plot. I never got the connection to the book name which is also confusing if you read McGuires book relating to OZ.
5,excellent love story,If only real true love happened this way. I would be so happy to be loved as much as Tobin loved Sofia.
5,Bulb Planter,This item works well. It worked great after I sharpened the cutting edge to go through grass and other small roots. I would recomend it to anyone after planting about 500 daffodils this past weekend.
1,do not recommend,wife was disappointed in the use of the bulb planter. Did not make a satisfactory hole in the ground; difficult to use. Gave it up and went back to using a shovel. Would not recommend.
1,Feel ripped off,"Packaging was poor! Cards were not mint in, top and bottom packs. Not one rookie card in all 36 packs...... Interesting??"
3,fybromyalgia,Not as enlightening as I'd hoped for. I got just as much out of watching Dr. Johnsons videos online. There is a lot of medical terms that I didn't care to memorize or learn.
4,Herbie Mann,Only in the seventies would a jazz artist making a disco song which obviously was very popular in the night clubs since it hit number 1 on the disco charts. Just for this one song this CD is worth getting if you are a collector!
2,Not What I Expected,"Recently, a friend who knew my musical tastes recommended Steve Earle's ""Train A Comin"". All I knew about Earle was that he'd written Tom Ame's Prayer from the great version by Robert Earle Keen. ""Train A Comin"" is probably the best CD I bought in '98 and I couldn't wait to learn more about Steve Earle's music. Unfortunately, the acoustic-folk-country sound of ""Train A Comin"" is virtually nowhere to be found on ""Aint Ever Satisfied"". This anthology of Earle's career is mostly rockin'-electric-country and, although very well done, does not match my musical prefernces (In this area, Emmylou Harris, David Grisman, Nancy Griffith, Garcia's Old & In the Way, Tony Rice, etc.). To those who love ""Ain't Ever Satisfied"", enjoy! and you may want to avoid all the artists I just mentioned."
3,Short but sweet,"Pretty good survey but not enough music to justify the price. And, everyone makes such a big deal about the 4 live cuts, but they've all been released before. ""State Trooper"" is from Guitar Town; and the other 3 are from Shut Up and Die Like An Aviator, which at 77 minutes, is a good deal."
2,Two for curious stance on a few true indictmants of the press,"Girls Gone Wild of Presidential Politics? Yeah, the previous reviewer's comment in spot on. Mostly strident silliness although it did point out one or two times when the pro Obama press went a little too far. One of those times concerned the story Sarah Palin's child and her daughter's pregnancy. Ooops! bad reporting? Or left wing conspiracy....... =;->To me it looked like dirty tricks. What gets me is how The Right and the GOP scream bloody murder when the Dems resort to dirty tricks, yet the GOP really invented theseshocking techniques in modern politics starting with the Muskie letter. Can you say Swift Boat?Obama may turn out to be the best President in modern times..... and the Crazy Right can't stand it."
1,The Law of Unintended Consequences,"Given the fact that even Ziegler has taken back many of the laudatory things he said about Palin, this documentary is a great organizing tool for OBAMA.And the way that young African American woman is manipulated at the end of the film proves the regrettable style of propaganda employed throughout."
1,"Really, Really Partisan","I wish I had known just how partisan this video would be BEFORE I watched part of it. It's really sad that so many people are unable to be objective anymore when it comes to politics. If you were looking for a fair, balanced and truthful look at the media's role in the 2008 presidential race, this video is NOT for you! Don't waste your time."
5,Headline of Product misleading,"This DVD is titled (2009), which is the original date. If one reads the Product Details, it can be discovered that this may be an updated version that was released on October 26, 2010.The updated version, I believe, contains 45 minutes more of information, which is not in the description anywhere for this DVD, and probably would be the preferable edition.So, really, which version is this? The original or the updated?I am disappointed in Amazon - this product should be described accurately."
4,Crucify her! Crucify her!,"I have long suspected the media had shown unfair prejudice toward Palin, but after viewing this, I'm convinced that whether deliberate or not, the contagious attacks we see daily on television and hear on radio are fed by unconfirmed, unverified stories that simply get passed from one outlet to another. While there are many ethical journalists in the business, by the time a ""story"" receives national attention, you can generally take the square root of what is said as fact. This MUST VIEW video proves yet another time that the one sacrificed at such a crucifixion gives us all the opportunity to change our act or lose our freedom forever!"
1,Not worth the time or a dime.,"Just another right-leaning, ultra-conservative backed project that is just as tiresome as the left-leaning, liberal film projects out there. Nowhere in this ""documentary"" does it present a balanced look at things. There are those of us independents that want REAL journalistic integrity, not journalism based on which way you lean. We are living in politically pathetic times and this video only propogates this notion. Don't waste your time or money on this, unless of course, you lean to the right and need some pep talk in your life."
5,Tried and true:,"I""ve used Pachmayr grips for years on a variety of guns and think they are the best, especially on heavy recoil revolvers. With factory grips many hard kicking revolvers land a painful blow from the back of the trigger guard to the knuckle of your middle finger. Pachmayr grips eliminate this, at least in my experience they do, and make for a much more enjoyable shooting experience."
2,generic,"If you're not looking for any talent or particular artist, this is it. Also, the audio has an airy background like it's been recorded with a tape player from [a local store]. I do recommend compilations like: Arabic Grooves, Cairo to Casablanca and Desert Roses I & II!!!"
4,jose juarez,"english not so good. I found CD at store in mexico city. like it. like hocico. gridlock very good. individual totem very good. velvet acid christ not to good. neutronic ok. buy this CD for first 2 people.thank you,jose"
2,China special,"This case looks great and is a nice design. However, the case is GLUED together in parts. Throw a little warm weather at it and it will start t separate. IT's just another junky ""Made in China"" case - should cost about $5. Buy a Handspring neoprene case and forget about your worries-thats quality!"
2,Annoying and hard to follow,"I bought this based on the great reviews and all the awards. Wow. Not too sure what the hype is all about. The character voices were so so annoying--I can't imagine listening to this multiple times. Then it jumps wildly from topic to topic. Galileo to Fibonacci sequences to magnetism and Mozart and so on in lightening speed. Nothing is covered well, just quickly, again in those annoying voices.The worst part for me, though, was the whole reason I bought the CD--I wanted some good skip counting songs. Holy cow. It is the most awkward, contrived, forced sequence you can imagine. It's set to Mozart's Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, and I wish I could sing it for you to show you just how weird the 2's are. Then it skips to sevens and omits the number 28.I wish I'd saved my money."
3,Under-documented re-release,"This set reproduces the recordings on a quite old boxed set of phonograph records. The documentation is brief and general and pretty much useless. However, if one is already somewhat familiar with this repertoire, there are several beautiful and unusual tracks, such as the Korean War Veterans' song. There is a wholly unrecommendable condensed version of this 2-CD set which leaves out some of the original recordings (leaving out the Korean War item too)."
3,VIOLATION OF PRIVACIES....,THE NATIVE AMERICAN invited many into this sanction of the world. I do not own this CD but just in listening to the long time private ceremonial songs and dances of ritual puts an earnest feeling of VIOLATION of rights of others on my mind. I feel as though I HAVE INTRUDED upon a very personal space. One that should be left for the eyes and ears of those for whom the ritual is being performed. LISTENING for purpose OTHER THAN to learn to perform the ritual on a reservation MYSELF... is like having spectators attend my pap smear! This one should remain a PRIVATE AFFAIR!- FEATHER IN THE STORM -
1,"Defective, if you can believe a simple thing like this can be defective!","I worked for almost an hour testing this little plastic splitter with earphones that work perfectly with my IPOD.The two holes for two different earphones are not the same size. The two earphones I tested only fit in one hole. You cannot put earphone plug into the other hole. If you do get one in the defective hole, it doesn't go all the way in and skips, cuts out, whatever. Also, the splitter doesn't fit tight onto my IPOD. That problem may create disruption.So, therefore, this splitter greatly diminishes the purpose of sharing your music. Rizzo"
2,Out of Round,"The Scanpan 8-inch steamer insert is out of round and doesn't fit the 3 quart sauce pan it was designed for, I have 15 pieces of ScanPan Pro and this was the only disappointment.Rich"
5,Much more than beautiful pictures.,"This book's wealth of practical infomation is presented in a well thought out, easy to understand fashion. Chapters one through four are devoted to the planning of and caring for a cutting garden, as well as creating attractive floral arrangements. Without a doubt, though, my favorite section of the book is the 53 page Encyclopedia of Plants which lists 212 perennials, annuals, herbs, tubers, corms, bulbs, vines, shrubs, and, yes, even an occasional small tree which make suitable cut flowers. Each entry in the encyclopedia contains a photograph and description as well as tips on growing conditions, planting, care, and harvesting and conditioning. Ever wonder which cut flowers require searing, splitting or dipping into boiling water? You'll find the answers here!"
4,CD,I stil waiting to get the Cd with Marv Johnson TitleI pick a rose for my roseBest regardsLennart Fogenstad
5,One of my Favorite Authors,"Although I have not read this edition, D.H. Lawrence is one of my favorite authors so I must give it 5 stars. Glad to have this collection in my Kindle library."
4,"""Trailer"" should have been on this album.","""Southern Accents"" is a really good album,but it should have had at least ten tracks.It's a bit short.""Trailer"",a song that Tom Petty recorded during the ""Southern Accents"" recording sessions,should have made this album.But instead got canned and used as a B-side to his ""Don't Come Around Here No More"" 45 rpm single.The song can still be found on his 1995 ""Playback"" box set.But that is one of Petty's best tunes,and it absolutley should have been on this album and also released as a single as well.It's that good.Overall,this is still a good album,and I would still recommend it for the other great songs on it,such as the title track,""Rebels"" and of course ""Don't Come Around Here No More"".I give it a 4 out of 5."
5,AWESOME PETTY,"ONE OF TP'S BEST ALBUMS, EVERY TRACK IS GREAT, ESPECIALLY WITH THE AWESOME SHM AUDIO FORMAT. MUST HAVE FOR ANY CD COLLECTION, BUT DON'T PAY THESE RIDICULOUS OVER-INFLATED RIP OFF PRICES, I BOUGHT MINE FROM THE MUSIC SPECIALIST ON E BAY, SAVE YOURSELF A TON OF CASH.CHEERS!"
2,WARNING!!,"If you already spoiled yourself by playing the computer version(optimum speed), PS2 version, Dreamcast NBA 2K1--THEN DONT BUY THIS GAME--YOU'LL BE DISSAPOINTED LIKE ME. I've barely played it once after I paid 40 bucks for it. The options are all there, but the graphics and gameplay will haunt you."
3,great game but...,"Once again Ea sports has made a great game, the game play is beautiful and smooth. However this series is simply re-releasing the past two NBA live games with marginal improvments. The most glaring problem is a lack of a dynasty feature with free agents and drafting much like the MADDEN football series. If they would put in a year to year feature with all the goodies that other sports have this would be a fantastic game. How the game is right now just keep 2000 and buy something new."
4,NBA Live is fun but not much difference from 2000,This game is fun and all but EA Sports made this game so much like NBA Live 2000 it is crazy. I own both games and they are so similar. One of my favorite features though is you can edit real NBA players so you could make your favorite player who could be the worst player in the world to be better than Shaq. If you already own NBA Live 2000 do not buy this game just create the rookies on 2000 and make them like they are in real life.
3,"Good, but way to familier","I am a huge fan of nba live 2000... i bugged my girlfriend about getting 2001, and threatened that i would be too busy with it once it came in... i read all about it online... but let me tell u was i dissapointed... i guess i must have read all about the P.C. version... Because i was expecting rookie drafts... free agents, and maybe a salary cap... WAS I WRONG this game really needs a good franchise overhaul for 2002... 2001 is the exact same game as 2000.. a little difference on game play... but once u play it a couple of times its just as easy... All in all i don;t like the game as an improvement to the last one... thats why i gave it 3 stars... and i wish i could sit down with the makers of it and help for the next one.."
2,Unreliable,"This will be the best sounding pair of 2.1 speakers in the world. Until they inevitably fail after 1-2 years. Trust and act on the reviews posted all over the internet regarding these speakers' unreliably. Even after reading such reviews, I purchased a set about 1.5 years ago. They broke last week (broke: scratchy, distorted sound from tweeters and midrange drivers). What a waste of money and effort."
4,Shades of brown,"I really like these sandals. They are very attractive and comfortable. Perfect heel/platform height-I've never been comfortable in high heels or real chunky platforms. There's some metallic stuff on mine, none of the straps are completely metallic, tho'. This is not in the description. There is no wear, so I don't think they were used/returned."
3,Next is Generation Z?,"One gets the feeling from reading some of these books on generational differences that the authors have uncovered a goldmind of potential enless dimensions. The authors have devised a ""Generation Y"" rubric, which leaves them with ""Generation Z"" to come next, and then in the marvels of listings, back to ""Generation AA"", ""BB,"" and so on. Books such as this say the obvious, but in such a way that jacket blurb writers can find a sentence or two to pull up and extol."
5,Three years later and the analysis holds,"I've used info from Millennials Rising in the classroom (MBA marketing) and in my marketing consulting practice, and I can tell you that the premise resonates with Xers and Boomers who live and work with Millennials. Yes, these kids are REALLY different from previous generations--in many ways better, in a few others disappointing--but this book is critical to identifying and understanding those differences. Think, for example, about how A&F has failed to connect with today's youth after dominating the post-teen clothing market for a decade--actually, their sales dove just as the first Millennials went off to college. Understanding generational change is extremely important to marketers and I highly recommend this book to anyone whose business targets certain age demographics."
4,Missing the Point,"Many of the above reviews seem to have missed the point. According to the authors. the 'Millenial' generation will, first and above all, be characterised by conformity - but not until later.Right now, they are exploring different ways of conforming: obeying their parents, listening to their peer group, watching the media. Whichever way they, as a group, decide to go will not be apparent for 15 - 20 years yet. Right now, all we can expect to see is ""herd"" movement(as opposed to the generation X ""small group"" movement).And we are already seeing this - for example, in the recent Psychology Today article worrying about college students who don't seem to be able to make a decision without discussing it on their cell phones."
1,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"I was hoping to find a book that would place its finger on the pulse of American youth culture. Instead I got a book I found utterly useless. The book talks about teens in one county in Virginia. The authors write about the attitudes based on surveys of kids in Fairfax County, VA. Their surveys of the class of '00 only apply to one county. As for observations, they quote a few national statistics where they have them available (teen pregnancy, employment, economy, etc.), but their observations on teen attitudes and culture all talk only about the teens of Fairfax County. The teens in my area are very different from those the authors surveyed (and thank goodness, in some respects!) Just about all of this book is inapplicable to the nation as a whole."
4,Pre-Mil,"In this book author John Walvoord does an excellent job explaining the pre-millennial view of the book of Revelation. He points out how other scholars understand the different sections of Revelation, and he explains why he does not believe those interpretations are good. As much as he can Walvoord approaches the Revelation literally. I recommend this book to anyone studying the Revelation of John."
2,Another review of opinions,"If this is the first book you have read on the topic of understanding revelation, I would give this an average review. However, if you have already read other books attempting to decode the scripture, I would suggest you look at a different title.The author explains most passages by first giving quotations / opinions from various interpreters. Since the opinions are often in opposition, I find myself reading the authors summary of the opinions given rather than an opinion based on careful study of the scripture.There are a few good examples of revelation meaning tied to other scriptures, but not enough for me to support a good review."
2,Not so crazy about it,"The story is basic, and a little boring, about a little girlbeing in her aunt's wedding. I didn't care for the illustrations. Iended up returning it, and it's box. I ordered the little ring bearer, but it took so long to deliver, I canceled it."
5,Perfect book in every way!,"We ordered this lovely book (and it's companion ""The Ring Bearer's Big Day"") for our niece (age 6) and nephew (age 5). The books were better than we expected and were well worth the price. The kids thoroughly enjoyed them and acutally learned what to do. Other people in our wedding party subsequently bought them for their kids and are just as delighted. Thanks for carrying both titles."
2,weak,The promise was promising but plot as a whole is weak. Most of romantic fragments is completly unnecessary. The charecters behave irrational.
3,"Just the facts, ma'am...","This book has an awesome first chapter ... it hooks you right in. Unfortunately, you have to read about 30% into it before you get anything else besides the stereo-typed female scientist's history with men and relationships. The science stuff is fascinating when it's there, but this is more of a romance novel than sci-fi. Too bad, because the premise is exciting."
3,Novel ideas but average writing,"Very good imagination, not like anything else. Writing is average, not too exciting. Seemed to be rather short.Poor depiction of military, unrealistic scientist portrayal, but not a bad read."
4,great sifi read,"Great start with wonderful over the top science that has been dumbed down for the lay person to understand. Kept a good pace from start to finish. The finish seemed rushed however. I actually left the book feeling very sorry for Erica and her horrible decision skills in picking in men. However, she seemed happy in the end so all is well."
4,kept me reading !,I like the story line...quite unique...I just think that this could be a saga. i will be looking for the continuation of this story..that is how strong I felt about the charactor.
2,Weak story,"I could just not get into this story. The writing had errors as is common with these digital authors and could use a little editorial help, but this story just never seemed to catch my interest. I got 1/3 of the way through it and had to drop it"
3,Not bad,Wasn't a bad book. The story line was good but the characters were a bit too mundane. A quick read.
4,I didn't see that coming...,This one goes in some in some strange directions in the beginning only to take some twists and turns that bring things back around in some unexpected ways. Then everything ends with a conclusion that I didn't anticipate. It's hard to describe without giving anything away.
3,"A decent read, better than expected and quite good.","A real intertwining of time, place, culture and possibilities. A few mental stretches but good nevertheless. Give it a try."
2,Stretching it,"I love techni sci fi. Throw in some drama and I thrive. This is more of a Clive Cussler meets Space 1999 (Remeber that one? Martin Landau)which I guess is close but will have many armchair critics dismiss me.The writing form of the writer is actually good, the premise of the story is difficult to hold. DT to hold back a vacume? I think not, but I'd ask Mythbusters for a final judgement on that point if for entertainment value alone. I'm an easy reader and entertaining is all I ask. It was entertaining but not for the best of reasons."
3,Ice Tomb,The book dealt with an interesting concept. It was a bit loose getting from the original situation for the characters to the moon for the finale. Interesting read and if you watch Star Trek then you will be familiar with the concept of Transportation via wavelengths.
4,Ice Tomb review,Really enjoyed this book - well written story for this genre. I thought the characters were believable and the storyline fascinating
4,Some flaws but I enjoyed the storyline,"The author did a good job moving back and forth between the moon and Antarctica. While the 2 main characters (Erica and David) were fairly well developed, the others were less developed to the point of sometimes seeming juvenile in the way they spoke/reacted/related, etc. The end felt a bit rushed in that it seemed like ""I have to write an end so this is it."" Despite this I liked the flow and though it was easy to figure out what was going to happen, it kept my interest. I'd consider reading another book by this author."
3,I love the genre,"The premise was good, just too much in your head with the two main characters and too little development of the antagonist. I like to know that good triumphs eventually and was disappointed that the ending literally ended the earth."
2,Characters too flat in a story too contrived.,"Ms. Jackson needs more professional editorial support. At root, her ideas are interesting but execution fails to deliver. Especially at setting the stage for events that arise. Reading this story began to feel increasingly like the sequence of events built up to a revelations of the plot, but instead of a plausible reason for these revelations and plot twists, she ended up saying ""and then something magical happened (nebulous and undefined), so the story continues thus...""I didn't finish the book for fear of an ending like ""and then she awoke from her nightmare..."" Or something similarly anticlimactic."
4,Pretty far out,"I enjoyed this book very much; kind of made me think of the show Stargate. I really enjoyed that show on television and the movies also; if you like that kind of thing then you,'ll probably enjoy this book too."
2,Ice Tomb - Not a bad idea....but didn't bring me in all the way,The Ice Tomb - Not a bad idea....but didn't bring me in all the way.The characters were to steriotypical and the plot needed a little more foundation. I believe the author has promise and with a little less tandroms the characters would have been more complete.
2,Not worth more than $0.99,"Smoldering looks and electric touches shared between sexy scientists, while clad in Antarctic exposure gear or in moon suits. And the mystical powers of the number four. Pyramids and Atlantis! You'd be as well entertained with a feminist-heroine sci-fi fantasy movie."
3,More romance than science fiction.,I was expecting a science fiction story but this is more of a romance story aimed at young adults. This is hinted at in the description and I should have paid more attention. Nevertheless it is mainly sold as science fiction and I don't think it deserves a high score as such.
4,I have read this book twice,"I often wonder if they ever will through the ice find anything prehistoric in Antartica, and I don't mean mammoths.Once a verdant rain forest type area it is now 12 miles deep in ice cover - so discoveries there would be difficult to come across - who knows perhaps the story line will one day hold a wisp of truth instead of fiction - a good read."
1,Great premise with horrible writing,"I made it just past the point where the main character is invited to a highlevel NASA meeting and, when told another scientist has been selected for theproject, starts ranting about sexism being the cause. Then she startsbragging about all of her qualifications and threatens to blackmail everyoneif she's not chosen instead. This is within the first 60 secondsof entering the room.No author with any experience would have the hero/heroine react this way in aprofessional situation. Unfortunately, the previous chapters were just as amateurish.Went quickly into the e-trash."
1,None,"This book is like an early 1980's bad Harlequin Romance trying to pretend to be a Cussler adventure but written by twelve year olds with limited vocabulary...alternatively it was written as a joke to see how many suckers would part with a dollar, yup that would be me."
2,amateurish,"I'll give the writer credit for trying to come up with an original plot. But it's so convoluted with junk science, mythology and poorly explained technology that the impact gets completely ""entombed in the ice"". Character development is right out of a bad romance novel. And some of the metaphors are laughable. I'm glad I didn't pay too much for it."
3,muy fantasioso,"A pesar de gustarme los libros de ciencia ficción, este es demasiado fantasioso, el desenlace los sacan mágicamente de un sombrero"
3,"OK for a dollar, but...","It would be nice if there were better character development, the plot wasn't telegraphed, and the ending wasn't basically magic. Still, I will be first to concede that it is better than I can do at this time."
4,Enjoyable,"Easy read and enjoyable. Somewhat predictable yet worth the read. If you enjoy basic science fiction written well encompassed by a decent plot, give the author / book a shot."
4,This was a great book!,"It went back in time to achieve a SciFi experience in the present, a very interesting read, very enjoyable !"
5,Would make a great movie,"Suspenseful, intriguing and action-packed. It has all the elements that great SF or adventure movies are made of. The harsh settings are ideal - the moon and Antarctica - for an extreme mystery, yet the book doesn't stray too far from the true nature of science. Both main characters have experienced trauma in their lives that affect their behaviour. Eventually they are able to shed the bad experiences of the past. I was pulled in from the beginning and held until a very surprising ending. Looking forward to the movie."
2,Too much drama for SF,"The science fiction seemed okay, but I didn't read more than 50 pages. The book was filled with sexual tension between the characters and relationship issues. Not what I am looking for in SF"
5,Great book,The book is great. It runs two stories at the same time moving from one to the other. Started reading and could not put in downJeannie
5,An Aventure,"Ice Tomb is a deep look into the past and future. A thrilling ride to discover where we have come from and possibly where we go next. Human nature, for good or bad, remains with us. The workings of our universe, Nature, can not be controlled but only understood if we take the time to listen and learn."
2,"When I read my fiction ,it disturbs me that I can tell it's been written by a female, I admit that's a male point of view , But.","in Science Fiction I don't want to know about my hero's past, present or future lovelife feeling's, I want to know about the Science Fiction. If you want to write about about feeling's , write about Romance Novel's, then I'll know to leave it on the shelf."
3,story line is interesting,"enjoyed this book but it did become a bit extreme in its story when not all information seemed to point in the same direction, good characters"
4,ice tomb,a little dragged out and jumps a lot but well worth the read just don't except too much from it
2,So terribly improbable!,"The entire premise, the ""coincidences"" and characters are overly stereotyped and totally unbelievable. The only thing I liked was that David store Erica's thesis. He was a shallow cad, and that part seemed realistic. His changing to a ""good guy"" did not!"
3,"Clever plot, characters not so clever","It was hard to decide between 2 and 3 stars for this one. The plot was original and intriguing, but all the characters were completely underwhelming."
1,Horrible,The characters were unlikeable and poorly fleshed out. Way too much emotion guiding every move and conversation. The lead character has a bizarre sense of entitlement. The characterization of the U.S. military was laughable.Will never read anything from this author again.
1,Why bother?,"I find it difficult to accept the main characters behaving like brats. In the real world they would never even be considered for assignment in the such a harsh environment like Antarctica. Eventually I might finish this book, then again maybe not. Depends on whether I can get past the childishness, and on to the scientific plot which interested me enough to buy the book in the first place. I'll have to put it away for awhile and come back to it later, if I ever do."
1,Boring and irritating at the same time,"""Ice Tomb"" by Deborah Jackson is one of very few books which I disliked so much, I couldn't finish them. In this case I gave up after struggling through about one-third of the book.The premise of ""Ice Tomb"" might be fine, but the writing is definitely inadequate, and the end result is a novel, which is boring and irritating at the same time. One of its many annoyances is the eyes fetish permeating the writing. For each and every person appearing in the book, no matter how insignificant, their eyes are described. The reader is constantly bombarded with ""startling sea-green eyes"", ""mahogany eyes"", ""intriguing mossy eyes"", ""almond-shaped eyes"", ""hazel eyes"", ""slate-gray eyes"" and eyes that ""had a Medusa quality that had made Cathy shiver more than once"". It's so weird and unnatural, that I couldn't stand it.In my opinion such style might be acceptable in romances sold at the grocery checkout line, but in case of ""Ice Tomb"", it ruined the book."
2,"Nice idea for a Book, however the plot has too many flaws to live up to the potential.",It began as something really interesting and the overall idea for the book has potential however there are numerous flaws such as:1) week characters2) a villain that only shows itself up in a completely unreasonable way and pursues objectives that are also completely unreasonable in the context of the plot3) illogic plot decisions (why it is the geologist that figures out an important scientific puzzle related to quantum mechanics when there is a physicist in the team?)4) a dangerous event that kills many people from a certain group and make the disappear without trace but has no effect on several other people at all.
3,A bit far fetched,"The plot of this sci-fi thriller was a bit too hard for me to ""believe"".I normally accept quite a lot from sci-fi writers - I can ""beleive anything"" if they manage to build up a certain logic of how the incredible events could happen. This story failed to do just that for me.I would have liked more exploration into how the fantastic things they discover ended up where they were. - Maybe that would have helped?And also I think the plot of the main characters didn't really get me interested...I'm no writer, so I don't know how it could be improved - all I know is I was a bit disappointed with this book"
2,Mills and Boon on ice.,Somewhere in here is a reasonable story trying to claw it's way out. It just is caught up in a quagmire of overdone romantic overindulgence. It's a struggle to read and I feel it would have been so much better to strip the Barbara Cartland component.
1,potential,"I didn't know if I was reading a science fiction, a scientific, an adventure, or a romantic novel. Ms. Jackson has the potential to write a solid story if she stayed within one genre. She has a gripping sense of wording that she strays from. I really don't think I'd buy another of her novels."
2,Started out OK... and then,"For those of you who like technical sci-fi and thrillers, this might be the cup of coffee you're looking for. It started out OK, so I stuck with it until .... well ... until it just got too cold to finish."
2,Just struggles to maintain interest,"There was something about the forced nature of the story telling, I could not read without wondering why the writing just didn't seem to flow, I still don't, it just feels forced somehow.The story did get better as I worked through it but ultimately it felt unrewarding."
3,Science fantasy,Pretty strange book filled with action and a bit too much science. Kept me interested but the ending was way crazy
2,Pedantic with poorly developed characters,"The main plot is interesting, but the characters and their dialogue have all the depth of onion skin. Very difficult to suspend disbelief as you read along, which compromises the pleasure that could be derived from this book. If you're a techie who enjoys playing with hard science theoreticals you might like reading this book. If you want depth and sophistication, look elsewhere."
3,Ice and snow and SF,"This was a book I did not expect to be good but it had an interesting story line that takes place in Antarctica. I have been there so I wanted to see what it was about. This is is what I call a strong women book. It is written by a woman and the main character is a woman. The point of view never clicks for me but that is just me. Anyway, it is a reasonable story and the description of the continent is pretty accurate. I liked the main idea of the story but the characters were a little off some how and more TV like. I don't hate it but there are better books."
2,The worse characters ever,"The plot was good, quite good. But the characters. I was going to write that they were like 14 years olds. But that is insulting to 14 year olds. There was 0 level of maturity, foresight, any reflection whatsoever. And the author has some kind of eyebrow obsession. All emotions involving surprise, of which there are a lot given the plot, are expressed through eyebrows being raised, then raised even higher and higher, until eyebrows are shooting up into the hairline. Ok, it has to make you laugh after awhile. But what wasn't funny was the heroine, who just acted impulsively and, yes, very much like a 14 year old. If you loved that female astronaut who put on adult diapers and attacked her lover (a true story) then I guess you will like the way this scientist is described. Otherwise, read it for laughs and for everything you don't want your daughter to grow up to be."
4,I liked it.,This book is a good read after you get through the first chapter. I liked it. Just stick with the book.
4,It's a Keeper,"Set in Burgundy in 1167, this novel combines excitement with a very real and deep knowledge of life in medieval France, especially in backwater areas. The rescue of the Red Keep involves learning about class differences, guilds, the treatment of Jews, and more, but the background is never forced, and neither are the moral lessons. It's all of a piece with the story. From another writer, it would've gotten 5 stars, but I wound up comparing this book to the same writers THE STORY OF ROLF AND THE VIKING BOW."
4,Not so surprised,"I first heard ""Surprises"" in the early 70's so this was a bit of a nostalgia trip. I still really like Cissy Houstons straight forward soul music approach combined with the light jazz feel of Mann's flute.This album sits comfortably in the background but deserves at least one serious contemplation and contains a particularly memorable version of J.J.Cale's ""Cajun Moon"" which kept repeating on me even after just one listening.I confess a preference to Cissy's voice and approach to that of her currently more famous daughter that may reflect the above mentioned nostalgia.Waterbed doesn't have the same appeal but is inoffensive and may grow on me in time.Overall a worthwhile purchase that I unreservedly recommend."
2,I found it quite easy to stop listening!,"This is pretty miserable stuff. The tempi are weird, the pianist definitely does not have a ""singing tone"" as others have claimed, and the sound quality ranges from just okay to really bad. But then I've been listening to the Glenn Gould recordings for many years (with the wonderful Sony sound on CD's--how I wept for joy when I realized that I'd never have to hear my favorite music on scratchy old LP's anymore!) Gould's Bach is my desert-island music, and the only reason I give Fischer's version two stars (rather than one) is that it is recognizable as Bach, THE greatest composer."
5,... of the Best,"I owned this release on record some 25 years ago. The CD is exceptional. Their music still gives me chills when I listen to it. These guys were really good at their game. Top Class! I played this CD 2 weeks straight in my car. It brought back so many memories. Ain't no way I can ""Cool it Now""!"
5,New Edition Is The Greatest,"This album is spectacular! It takes you back to the day when music was REAL and people actually sang as opposed to being studio products. At such a tender age the members of NE were AMAZING. This album is classic and stands the test of time. Even Bow Wow sampled the song ""Leaving You Again"" for his new hit ""Like You."" This is a MUST have for any true fan of real music. NE-4-LIFE!"
5,A.L.O.N.E. for life,"Classic! This brings back. To all of yall whom are between the ages of 28-33-you know what I am talking about when it comes to NE. I remembder the posters,concerts (one of the very few groups who put on a GREAT show, and clowning around in the class room dreaming about NE-especially Ralph(before Johnny arrived). Man I miss those days! Hey to all my A.L.O.N.E. girlfriends back in high school this take me back. BTW- A.L.O.N.E means a lover of new edition a group name me and my girlws went by back in the days."
5,The second of New Edition greatest hits of the mid 80's.,"I was getting girls in the 6th grade singing this album. All you needed back them was some New Edition and money for a ice cream sandwich to get your girl. Ralph and the crew slay the somewhat bubblegum but wholesome tracks. Stand out tracks are pretty much the whole album even Maryann. Personal fav's are Lost in Love, Delicious, Telephone Man, Cool it Now and Leaving you again."
4,A book which covers an important issue we are facing in out Global Village.,If you have read much of Jung's works especiallyMan and His Symbolsthen don't expect any surprises this text pertains to the importance of individuation. Important in Jung's time and in our Global Village. This book only pertains to the pertinence of the issue not the how. So once you are done I suggest readingEgo and Archetype. A good book none the less and a decent intro to Jung Psych although I feel thatMan and His Symbolsis a better introduction.
3,Vero Jo,"It was a bit hard to get it setup so that the water spread out evenly over the dome. Neither of my cats was interested, but I gave it to my son and his 3 cats love it !"
3,A little temper mental,My cats love this water dish more than I do.... Of course they aren't the ones who have to try and make the darn thing level so that it will flow evenly over the dome. They do seem to be drinking more than when we were using the Petmate drinking fountain.
4,It Works,"Works as advertised, which the filters would last a bit longer, but they do the job they are suppose to."
4,Catit Filters Work Well,"Designed for the Catit drinking fountain, which my two cats love. It took some getting used to for them, but they drink more water now. Filters are reasonably priced and last a decent time before needing to be changed. If you run out of filters, you can temporarily take the filter in the drinking fountain, rinse it out and reinsert it. It will last long enough for your new filters to arrive. Having a new / clean filters is an absolute necessity for the fountain, not just because it keeps the water clean, but it keeps the pump quiet and a smooth stream pumping out of the fountain."
2,fliters for cat it fountain,"filters don't seem to last a long time. does not seem to be much activated charcoal in the filter.good ideas but skimping on ingredients.still, better than nothing I suppose"
3,Catit water filters,"Cat-It Filters are good. But, price varied within a few weeks. The first time, it was higher. Just placed another order. Wish that the length of time was more for use than fewer weeks. Cat does drink from it. Make sure the water tank is cleaned thoroughly, every two weeks, at least."
1,Number description wrong,"The description for the item plainly states it is 3 packs of 3 filters (total of 9). This is incorrect. Each box is 3 filters, it is not a box containing 3 packs of 3."
4,Prompt Delivery and Dependable Product,I have purchased these cartridges before. They are easy to use. I just wish they came in packages of more than three.
