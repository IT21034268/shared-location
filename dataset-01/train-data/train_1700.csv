3,"Good bass response, missing some of the highs","As an in-ear headphone, these were fairly comfortable. They also did a good job of drowning out ambient noise. The bass response was good, but the high-end frequencies were missing. A little muddy sounding in the highs, not as crisp as a set of Bose headphones, but definitely good value for the money."
4,Great purchase. Well worth the money.,"These headphones are fantastic for the price. The sound is good, and they fit comfortably in your ear when you wear the right size earbud. They come with three buds that you can interchange to get the right fit. My only complaint is the style of wiring. These are the style that has one earbud on a short wire and one on an extra long wire. I prefer headphones that split and remain the same length. Other than that these are great."
3,Great Headphones for the Price,Really like these headphones...the 2nd pair i have bought...great sound....but flimsy....already lost one set of ear cushions...and wire broke on one side...but for the price..still a good buy....my brother wife and i have one set each....
3,Black is Better than White,"I own two pairs of these headphones. One black, and one white. The black rubber has proven to be much more durable. I have had the black pair for about 3 years and have used them daily. They have held up very well. The white pair is less than a year old and the rubber is fraying. The sound is excellent by any standard."
3,Sony please fix this design defect!!!!!,"These are fantastic sounding headphones that are comfortable to wear. However, the design of the insulation on the wires is less that stellar. The insulation literally melts off the wires into a sticky goo, leaving exposed copper wire with chunks of white insulation here and there. It's quite bizarre.If Sony would improve this minor defect, these would be five star headphones."
3,2 years of good service,"I'm not an audiophile, so I'm not even going to try to comment about the sound quality, but I think it's ok.Since it's in ear earphones, they do isolate some of the outside noise but it's far from perfect. It's much better than the stock earphones of most mp3 players, but don't expect not to hear the bus engine at all.After 2 years, they gradually stopped working, but it's a respectable lifespan considering the hard conditions at my bag and my pocket without any protection."
1,OK sound. Poorly Designed,"The sound was okay for listening to podcasts. However, the wire of the longer ear bud frayed and broke off in 3 months. Now I have one ear bud which would be fine if this were 1972 and I were listening to a transistor radio in class."
2,"Good initially, poor longevity","I bought this product at the beginning of February. Sound quality is fine for an earbud, especially at this price point. I've mainly used the headphones for working out, and for situations when I want to block out some background noise. They worked great up until a few days ago, when suddenly the right earbud stopped working. I would not buy these again - it seems you certainly get what you pay for."
3,"Not Bad,But Not Bright","These can be found pretty cheap, so you may be very happy with them if you don't like a strong high range. In-ears tend to be bassy, and these are too, but they lack definition in the treble range. I have a pair of fontopia 21s that I like better, and they're cheaper."
4,Great for small ears!,"These are the best headphones I have ever used. I have small ears, and these work very well, and stay where they are supposed to. I have tried the kind that just go in your outer ear, and they always make my ears hurt because they are too big, but they also fall out a lot. I can listen to music for a couple of hours and not have any pain from the Fontopia headphones. The only thing you can't do while using these is eat. :) The noise of crunching is amplified. Even though these aren't noise canceling headphones, they still block outside noise pretty good."
1,Serious Problems,"I ordered two sets of these, both of which broke within a couple of weeks of using them. One side shorted out and quit working. The first set was the left side. The second set was the right."
5,great headphones,These headphones are the best I've heard for how small they are. The bass is amazingly deep and strong. I use these headphones with my psp and I recommend them to anyone.
2,Great sound but that's it.,"I was never a fan of such earbud type of headphones and so should have stayed away but decided to try them since they advertised comfort from the different sized earpieces.Must say that they are comfortable from any of the other types of headphones I've had and sound is great too, but they still keep falling off. I bought them for working out, but they don't stay put. Also, I guess its supposed to be a good design but the right ear cord is bigger than the left, but I don't like that feature. The cord goes behind your neck and its annoying.Another annoying thing that, I, at least experience is that the headphones are so good at keeping noise out that you get this inside noise (like when you're under water). Not sure how to best explain this, but you can hear yourself chewing a piece of gum for example.So very good sound, but the cons outweight the pros.If you never liked these type of earbud headphones, don't bother."
3,They Fall Apart,"I love the sound and comfort of these ear buds, but I've had to buy four pairs in the last 18 months because the insulation on the wiring is made of some spongy latex-ish material that feels real hip and futuristic or whatever but has a tendency to twist itself around the wires it's housing until it tears itself apart. All of my pairs became a patchwork of electrical tape from the jack to the buds before I finally had to dump them and get another pair. But they're cheap enough that it's forgivable, for awhile."
3,"Good product, but be glad there's a warranty","I wanted headphones that mostly (but not completely) canceled out background noise and fit in my ears better than the ear buds that came with my iPod & these definitely fit the bill. Audiophiles will want to upgrade, but for those of us just wanting a decent set of headphones, these are a very affordable option.Unfortunately, the right ear bud suddenly starting putting out almost no sound. Luckily they come with a 90 day warranty from Sony. I just went to Sony's website & put in a request & sent them off to get fixed/replaced. I just sent them out, though, so I don't know how long it takes for them to come back."
3,"Good bass, dissapointing high frequency response...","I bought the EX51LP to replace my ipod earphone. The original earphone did not fit well into my ear and it was quite painfull if after a few song. I decided to give the earbud type of head phone a try.Comfort - Very good, fit comfortably.Sound quality - very good bass - deep, strong, and natural. High frequency response is not accurate. If you pay attendtion to the ""s"" and ""t"" as in ""sweet"", there is simply too much emphasis on the ""s"" and ""t"". Snare drum is quite annoying in some song."
3,"Good quality sound, bad production","I agree with the other reviews posted here regarding the functioning quality of these earbuds (high quality sound, plus they fit snugly enough so as to serve as quasi-noise-cancelling), but I have a qualm regarding the manufacturing quality of the device. After less that nine months' usage, the rubber wire casing has frayed off by one of the earbuds, and the exposed sections of wiring are increasing as I use them more. While I wait on a new pair of headphones, I am having to tape over the wiring for lack of any other covering. So, if you use headphones when you go to sleep, as I do in my dorm, or are otherwise rough on your gear, be wary of purchasing these earbuds. The wear and tear over the course of a few months' sleep may just ruin your purchase. If you just use earbuds while you jog or bike or whatnot, these should serve you well, but they did not stand much incidental abuse in my case."
1,Poor quality materials.,"I really find these headphones comfortable and inexpensive. I'm not an audiophile but for me, the sound is fine for both audiobooks or music. The problem is the rubber coating surrounding the wires of these headphones are so sub par they tore and then began to disintegrate within a month."
3,"Not bad, but I've experienced better","These headphones are not bad for the $10 retail you save on Amazon (thanks!), but if I hadn't previously owned the ""sound-isolating earbuds"" model from Brookstone, I'd probably like these a lot more for the price I paid. Again, I know we're not talking $100+ headphones here and can't expect the best in sound and product quality but in my opinion they just aren't as comfortable and snug (for one, cheaper rubber), nor were they as loud which makes a big difference in airplanes and noisy environments. Anyhow I bought these so I can own a second pair without a retractable clip device for motion activities. These Sonys do the trick but I just wish they had the same sound and comfort as my Brookstones and that is why I have to give them 3 stars for just being average. They are by no means a waste of money and not bad for $29 on Amazon, but I just expected a little better from Sony."
4,Good headphones for the price,"We're happy with these for an iPod nano. Fit better and sound better than the Apple originals.Fit is important for these in-the-ear headphones. These come with different sizes of silicon plugs to fit different size ears.In-ear headphones give richer, louder sound than the original iPod phones. You will enjoy these."
2,could be better...,"They sound good, but the rubber cushions keep falling off. You can't wear them with out the cushions. Only the small ones fit my ears, so now I have to find extra cushions and buy those."
3,"Good sound, but fit is so-so","The sound is very good. But even after trying all three adapters, they don't stay in very well. I'm getting tired of having to constantly re-insert them while I'm riding my bike. It's enough of a pain that I'm going to replace them."
4,great fit and sound,They come with different size ear pieces to easily fit in most ears. I like how comfortable they are and also how well they blocked out the outside noises. The sound is good. They only thing I don't like is that rubber ear pieces can pop off pretty easily and could be lost. I have had mine come off several times but luckily saw where they landed.
4,Overall pretty pleased,"The headphones are exactly as described - they reduce noise and are very comfortable on the ears. I have never worn more comfortable headphones!However, I am a little dissappointed with the wiring. Every time the wire moves against an object, say my clothes or my computer, you can hear the static. I wish that was not there- but the comfort wins!!"
3,"Nice at first, but...","...after a while I found things I didn't like. The around the neck chord design is good as long as you aren't moving too much, but when you are, for example, jogging, the left ear bud tends to pull out (although I did like that they hang around the neck when they aren't in the ear). Also, the rubber ear pieces do fall off and get lost, and once that happens you have to switch sizes.After 5 months of hard use (I'm not too gentle on my earbuds), the left ear quit working. My suspicion is that the failure was due to the chord design, but really only a guess.I did find that the sound and bass quality was good, but for my purposes it wasn't enough to buy another pair."
2,Comfortable but may cause hearing loss,"I got these because the traditional ear bud earphones never fit in my ear properly and were very uncomfortable. These fit extremely well and the sound was great. One day I started to experience a vibration in my ear and after weeks of experiencing this I realized it was caused by the earphones. I think because the earphone sits so much further into the ear, it's much harder on your eardrum. Maybe my ears are extremely sensitive but I'd still be very careful when using these."
5,"Great fit, fine sound for the price","Jan 1, 2006 - finally an earbud that fits. I read all the reviews and just await the short lifespan. will view as disposable - it is worth it to finally have a pair that fits my ears!Aug 8, 2006 - checking back - no problem with construction, but then I don't live 24/7 with my ipod. buying a second pair for my ipod video, these are an essential for me!!"
3,"Good bass, snug fit and good noise isolation but...","I was initially thinking of buying the 81LP's, but one particular reviewer for 81LP pointed out the 51's had better bass. Well thats absolutely correct! I've used both of them and this has got a deeper bass. I miss the ""Elastomer hanger"" of the 81 LP's though. BUT. There's definitely one problem that you cannot ignore. The earphone cords transfer some amount of noise to the earphones, eg. when it brushes your clothes. This can be annoying sometimes. :( I also have a pair of samsung earphones that came along with the YEPP mp3 player and they don't transfer any sound from their cords at all! but then their sound quality is not as good as the 51LP's and they don't fit very well in my ears. So if you don't move around too much or you have something to hold the cord in place then the 51 LP's do just fine."
2,Never thought Sony'd make such sucky headphones.,"I did not buy this model from Amazon, but right from the SonyStyle shop for $39.99. I wanted to use them with my Hi-MD player instead of the old ones. After I plugged them in and listened to the song, the first thing I thought was I'd have to return them right away. The sound was unbearably unpowerful and I couldn't hear any base channel or whatever it's called. I unplugged them and plugged the old ones on and noticed a HUGE different. This is the first item that makes me feel disappointed in Sony. I just wanted to warn those who're looking at this model to think twice. Anyway, I love the design."
1,BEWARE! Cords decompose!,"Avoid these headphones at all costs, especially if you would buy these to listen with while you work out. Mine lasted for about a month and a half before the cord started decomposing. The material used is very poor, the white turns yellow and then disintegrates just through normal use. If you are considering these for working out, don't buy them, they will not stay in your ears. That is assuming you sweat when you workout, these will slip out and just become more of an annoyance than anything."
1,Never recieved them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I ordered these over 1 month ago and never got them. It says they tried to deliver them, no note, nothhing in the mailbox. I dont even know who to contact for a refund. it says they ended up in Lexington. i live in california. wtf?"
2,Not worth it the $$,"I bought these to replace the original headphones that came with the iPod. The original headphones do not handle bass very well and distorted pretty easily but sounded very ""warm"" on other settings. These sounds thin and distort easier.They do a good job keeping out noise, great if you have talkative co-workers. One thing I noticed on my pair is how it ""whistles"" in the wind. The wind noise I hear pretty much negates how well it keeps out ambient noise as not all i hear is the whistling sound."
2,What a disappointment,"The first three weeks of using these headphones were great. I was happy with the sound quality, and EXTREMELY satisfied with the confort. But after three short weeks, the rubber coating of the cord started falling apart. Mind you, I only listened to them for maybe a couple hours each night, in bed, so they weren't exposed to the 'elements', nor was I using them while working out. And they just started to . . . disintegrate.The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because of the sound quality and comfort."
1,Poorly made.,"I had a pair of these and was very pleased with how comfortable they were compared to the ones that came with my 4th gen iPod. But the cord began showing signs of wear quite fast (about a month after I got them), and then the left ear bud suddenly fell apart. I'd never mishandled them or anything. My inexpensive Skullcandy ear buds sound just as good and have lasted much longer, and I feel like an idiot for forking over twice as much for these."
2,"Love these headphones, but the cord is aweful","These are great light-weight headphones, and they fit my ears perfectly; I will always buy these type of in-ear style headphones, but... the cord material is very fragile. After a while especially the section that goes behind my head from one headphone to the other, the cord is completely falling apart. The material has somehow broken down from the friction I believe and you can literally pick pieces of it off. I had to wrap the worst sections in duct tape...lame. I also have a pair of the MDR-EX71SL's these DO NOT have this problem. They must not use exactly the same material, b/c they are holding up MUCH better."
1,Really Bad Earbuds,"I bought these to replace a pair of Creative earbuds (one of the covers popped off and I can't find it). These seemed to have mostly positive reviews but on my Creative Zen Nano these are terrible, they are tinny and the sound quality sucks. If I were you I'd pick something else as these are a total waste of money."
5,No complaints!,"What is everyone complaining about? Having bought Sony Studio headphones for years (only replacing them because the cats got to them!) I bought these little guys the day I got my iPod. It took me only a couple of minutes to realize that the apple earbuds were junk, had terrible sound quality, and really sat uncomfortably in my ears.I've had these headphones now for a few years and not a single problem! I got used to the cord extension ( and like that they can hang from my neck), the silicon is so comfortable I have slept in planes, trains, and automobiles with them in, and the sound is fabulous. I don't have to blast my eardrums out to pretend I'm hearing good sound quality. Its there at every level.GREAT BUY!"
2,"Good sound, but junky construction","These sound fine. In fact, I bought them in part because of positive reviews on the site. And they're quite inexpensive.But be careful: these are not well made. Mine broke after just 8 months of regular use, giving my ear an electrical burn in the process! And the warranty is a measley 90 days! I would most definitley think twice before buying these."
3,Great sound for the money. Poor design.,"For the price, you probably can't beat the sound quality of these earphones. Very good, and a huge improvement over standard iPod earbuds. Unfortunately, there are a couple of design flaws:1. The rubber eartips don't attach securely enough. They have fallen off numerous times. I've been able to find them, but losing them is a distinct possibility.2. The uneven cord design. Looking over the other reviews, I know I am not alone in this. I really dislike this design feature, so much so that I just bought a different set of earphones. Sony, are you listening?"
1,Not good Earbuds,"I have them like 3 weeks for my laptop and the Left earbud start to fail, and the cable looks in good condition and It really doesn't have a rude use. I use it always on my desk. I don't recomend it!"
3,Not bettrer than the one comes with Ipod,"These in-ear headphones have a good build and well-fitted inside the ear, but the sound quality is somehow disappointed comparing it to earbud that comes with Ipod but they are damaged easily. However, I am not suggesting the quality is too bad, for the price point it play vocals well with excessive treble and the bass is not aggressive, so these are for mainstream users. If you want the truer sound quality move to highend series. I would recommand creative in-ear headphones or even better one from Sennhesier for more listening experience."
2,Not as good as claimed by others,It is not worth the money. I would not recommend it. Base is not good even after trying different sizes of silicon pads. I think a better one in that price range can be found.
2,bad buy,These headphones were probably my worst buy of the year. As a musician sound quality and crispness is very important. These headphones have neither. Its true I really should suck it up and buy a pair of bose but once again as a musician I am poor.These headphones don't compete with the standard iPod earbuds as far as performance. As confort goes the sony's are fantastic but thats as far as it goes. Poor volume range and quality make for an extremely bad buy. If you like the sony's spend 5 or 10 bucks more and get the 81's (MUCH BETTER).
5,Very comfortable and seem better quality,"Last year I bought these in black, but toward the end of the year, the coating began to disintegrate. I loved them so much, they sound great and are so comfortable that I can wear them for hours without any problem, that although they are a bit pricy, I bought these white ones to replace them. The coating on the wires seems much thicker and heartier, I've had them a month now, and they seem not so soft as the black. I'm very happy with this purchase.."
5,Great Sound!,"I've had three pairs of this model of Sony Headphones (the first pair broke after extensive use and the second pair was chewed through by kittens). Needless to say, I love them, they're comfortable and sound great!"
3,Keep looking,"Bought these buds to replace the horrible stock buds that came with my Nano. They are comfortable in the ears, but the sound is not as good (tinny). Much of the bass dynamics are lost. I tried all three sizes of bud canal pieces to get claimed sound. Keep looking, spend more I guess."
4,pretty good,"This headphone is great for outdoors, especially on the train. It's also very comfortable. After I've used this for a few days, I tried on my old iPod headphone that came with my iPod and it felt sooo uncomfortable and realized the bad sound quality it delivered.Con- Be careful not to lose the earbuds."
2,good and bad,"i really liked these earphones at first. mostly because i have a difficult time finding earphones that fit in my ears and don't fall out while at the gym. they are extremely comfortable and you can wear them for extended periods of time and while running.however, i have been through two sets of these in a span of 6 months because, for some reason the right earphone stops working. i'm not sure if this is because my ipod is too strong for the earphones...? but yea. i like the earphones, its just kind of annoying that they only last a couple of months."
2,Bass-less review,"Quite disappointed with the bass response of these headphones. Might work for some kinds of music, but for my vanilla rock-n-roll even at medium volumes on my iPod, the low freqs were nullified. Asymmetrical cable lengths also takes some getting used to.Aloha, Neal"
4,Great Item,"These are a great value for the price. I use them at the gym all the time, where they play extremely annoying 80s music at about the volume of a landing jumbo jet. So far so good--I hear my music and my music alone!"
3,Comfortable Fit - Weak Base,"I purchased these to replace my stock IPOD Nano headphones. They are stylish and comfortable. Unfortunately, the base response is poor. I also don't care for the daisy chain wire connection from one ear to the other compared to the ""Y"" configuration of the stock IPOD headphones."
3,Ehhh...,I Recived a pair as a Christmas giftthere decent for the pricei dont like the behind the ear thing it makes it almost imposible to listen with a friend
2,Don't Stay in your ear,"Take this review knowing that I am someone who is just an average music/ipod listener.I just got an ipod and was pumped to get some earbuds since I heard the ipod earbuds didn't produce great quality sound.I did tons of research, read all the reviews and thought these earbuds were my best bet for the money I wanted to spend. But they simply don't stay in while you are working out.I am an avid excerciser, lifting, basketball, etc. And every lifting session my left earbud, due to the design, would fall out numerous times.In short if you are going to use these riding a bike or sitting around, they would be great. Good sound. But don't expect to use them during workouts. They fall out constantly. I returned them and am using the ipod earbuds, which rarely fall out of my ears. Much happier with them.I gave it two stars because of good sound quality... at least when their in your ears."
2,Aweful Headphones!,"These headphones are so expensive and they are aweful! I dont remember if it was the left or the right but one side of the cord is longer than the other; its very annoying! I tried to loosen it and the wire was showing, what a piece of s***. Its very annoying because the ear bud fell out when I listened to music and it doesnt feel comfortable. Also the rubber on the ear bud falls off very easily. They are too expensive for a piece of junk! The only reason I rate it two stars is because the sound is great on the headphones. Instead purchase the Sony SRF-HM01V S2 Sports Walkman Street Style Headphone Radio. I purchased those after these fell apart and they are much better :)"
1,Different Lengths for Each Ear Very Annoying,"I cannot figure out why Sony would intentionally use different lengths of cord for each ear. It is incredibly annoying. Naively thinking I could somehow adjust the length, the slightest tug at the cords pulled them apart. Waste of money."
1,Poor Quality,"I had these headphones for five months. They began breaking apart one month after my purchase. One day, I fell asleep with my headphones on. When woke up in the morning, the lining had melted. Literally, parts of the rubber had dissolved and exposed the wires. I ghetto-rigged the wires with Scotch tape to salvage the $40 headphones. I think for the price, they should last at least a year. The overall sound was good. However, I don't think you'll be using these after the exposed wires begin to nibble at your earlobe."
4,Good while they lasted,I only got to use these for about 2 weeks before my cat ate them.... but while I had them I liked them. Overall good sound quality. Much better than the overpriced apple crap.
2,Good...at first,Sound quality was great. The assembly and overall quality of the product itself: very poor. Would not recommend or buy again. The wires frayed and became exposed without very much use of the headphones.
2,"Great sound, good fit, lousy construction",I've owned two pairs of these Sony headphones. The sound in the right phone of my first pair mysteriously died after about six months. I looked into it and a few other people online had the same problem. Some blamed it on yanking the phones out by the wires but I never did that. I'm gentle as a lamb with my electronics and their accessories. So I figured it was a fluke and I bought another pair.It's been a bit more than six months and my latest pair just lost sound in the right phone. I guess that's twice as long as the warranty but I'm not spending sixty bucks a year on headphones.The sound quality is nice and they're comfortable. But the lousy quality is so frustrating that I can't give more than two stars.My advice - in-ear headphones are the only way to go for those of us who have a noisy commute on a subway or bus. But stay away from Sony Fontopia. I'm going to give the Sennheiser CX 300S a shot.
4,Very good for the price,"I had the MDR-EX71's and enjoyed them a lot - but the rubber piece that connects the wire to the earbud tore after a few months. So instead of getting a second pair, I decided to give these a shot.Sound quality seems to be the same as the 71's... the wire connects to the earbud inside of a plastic housing that seems to be much more durable... you'll hear many people complain about the length of the 71's - without the extension cable it's far too short, and with it, it's too long, and too heavy, pulling the bud out of your ear. The 51's length is great.I've tried in-ears from Philips, Koss, and a few others, and these are the best I've found. Didn't give them 5 stars because they still slide out a little too easy - but it takes a decent amount of movement, e.g. running, until they slide out."
4,"Good experience, but low durability.","I've bought about eight pairs of these, including three that I ordered today. They last about 3-4 months on average. I really like the design, and the sound quality is quite sufficient for my casual on-the-go needs (I mostly listen to spoken podcasts anyway).I tried a different brand recently--a more expensive model--but that set only lasted 6 months, and wasn't a substantially-better experience in terms of sound quality. also, the other brand wasn't a behind-the-ears design, which is tough to go back to once you're used to this type of design. So overall I would say it wasn't worth what I paid for it. This model, even if it's prone to failure, is a better value overall."
3,Comfortable but don't stay put,"I bought these after trying a friend's, because the earphones that came with my iPod hurt my ears. These are really comfortable and stay in until I start to sweat. After about 30 min of cardio exercise, (running or elliptical) they begin falling out. I have to keep stopping, wiping my ears, wiping the little rubber thingy, and jamming them back in.I've tried all 3 different earpieces that it comes with and this didn't alleviate the problem.Bummer, because they are comfy. Also, sound is not as good as the iPod earphones. Bass is lacking. Ordering a new pair today that clips to the ear. Will see how they are."
2,not very comfortable and fall out easily,"These headphones came recommended from a friend. Unfortunately, I wanted to use them for running and they are clearly not for that. They fall out very easily, even when you do the whole ""pull up on your ear and jam into your ear canal"" thing.They even feel loose when sitting at a computer, which is disappointing.The case/wire-wrap is a joke.The sound quality is nice, though - much better than cheap headphones as you can actually hear some bass and low frequencies."
3,Alright,"These ear phones are ok if you are looking for something to sit on an airplane with. If you want to workout with them then they are a bad idea. I generally don't like Sony products from past experience of bad design and lack of quality. I would say that this is true for the headphones as well. The ear pieces are not equally divided which allows for easy detection of which plug goes in which ear, but when running it causes the ear pieces to pull out. If you like Sony then give it a shot, otherwise find a better brand for $20 these where not worth it."
5,Sony Earbuds,"I've been very pleased with the sound these earbuds provide. I also like how they stay in my ear while I'm working out. About the only negative thing I can say is that they last about a year of almost daily use, so make sure you get the warranty."
1,Do not buy!,"I have been pleased with other Oxo products and so when outfitting the kitchen of my vacation home, I went right to Amazon to buy what I needed. This is not only a poor excuse for a peeler but bad for the Oxo brand. It does not peel a potato! The blade is dull and barely scratches the surface of the peel. Fortunately I had a ""grandma style"" peeler that saved the day, or should I say dinner. I have other peelers of this style from William Sonoma that are champs, but they have plastic housings and don't look as nice. Looks, obviously, are not everything! Oxo appears to have dumbed down their products to sell at discount stores for a lower price and lower quality. This peeler went straight into my new trash can...."
3,"I'm just not a Y peeler sort of person, I'm swivel all the way.",This has a much nicer handle than the Oxo swivel peeler but I prefer to use the swivel peeler. This is well made and sturdy so I expect it to be in my drawer forever but I wouldn't replace it because of my aversion to Y peelers.
4,easy to use,This peeler is very easy to use. Comfortable handle makes gripping it easier. Easy to wash and clean. The blade is very nicely placed to avoid any accidental cuts and nicks. Been using this for the better part of 2 yrs now and it still retains its sharpness. Very good item. Highly recommended.
1,Not as advertised.,Needed a peeler that was 4 inches wide and they led you to believe that. Not junk but not as advertized.
5,Oxo Good Grips Y Peeler,I abosolutely love this peeler. It is the best I have ever used. It has weight to it that others don't have and fits comfortably in your hand. It feels so well-balanced!
5,Speed is the main thing with this!,"I had to peel 24 potatoes for a thankgiving bash and bought this yesterday because I knew my current one was not great. Could not BELIEVE how fast I got them peeled. Got the whole lot done in about 20 mins. For that alone this peeler is worth it, it makes peeling potatoes effortless instead of a bit of a chore. I've seen comments that the blade wasn't sharp or it didn't peel well. My one peeled great, I had to put hardly any pressure on the potato and it took off strips of skin easily, cleanly and from top to bottom in one movment. Highly recommend"
2,Poor peeler,"We purchased this OXO peeler based in great part upon positive customer reviews. We were very disappointed. Although the peeler has a good feel in the hand, the blade is very dull. This is fine if you are peeling something very hard, where you can press down and achieve an acceptable cut, it is virtually worthless on softer items, like a spear of asparagus. If you want an all-purpose peeler, choose another."
2,Good grip? Hardly.,"I normally like Oxo products because of how comfortable they are to hold (I have arthritis in my hands), but this one is a dud. The handle is too short. The handle is flat where it needs to be round (where your fingers curl around it). And it peels too thinly - when I peel carrots, the thin slices just cling to the carrot.I bought this peeler to replace a Hamilton Beach peeler that I'd taken to work, and I couldn't find the HB peeler on Amazon. I thought because this was Oxo, it would be good. I was wrong. I've brought the HB peeler home again."
1,EXTREMELY DANGEROUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I'm actually quite surprised there are so many good reviews and none that are negative. I almost lost my finger using this. :( It was quite a traumatic experience. I never had a knife cause this kind of damage so easily. Please be extra careful if you use this. Even better if you use a protective glove. I'm sticking with the Oxo Good Grips Swivel Peeler, which is an excellent peeler and inexpensive."
3,Buy the standard OXO Y Peeler,"Do not buy the i-Series - buy the standardOxo Good Grips Y Peelerinstead. I have both and originally thought ""If the standard works this well, the i-series must be incredible"" based on the reviews. However, the standard Y-Peeler works much better. The issue with the i-series seems to be that the little nub that keeps the blade from spinning is set ever so slightly too large, which keeps the blade from swiveling far enough to provide a comfortable angle to the vegetable when peeling. Despite the marketing hype, I also find no difference between the blades on the two OXO offerings."
5,My carpal tunnel savior!,"My wrists ache with other peelers, but the design of this one is fabulous. No wrist straining at all. I peeled a dozen potatoes and my wrists were completely fine. I am pain-free and so very happy with this peeler. It peels really well too. ;)"
4,OXO Good Grips Y Peeler,"OXO has built a reputation for producing reasonably-priced, very serviceable kitchen tools. This peeler is another in a long line of their ""Good Grips"" series that deliver tactile pleasure in performing cooking grunt work."
5,Hefty Kitchen Utensil,"This is why I always will purchase OXO kitchen products. They are hefty and well made. I have several OXO kitchen products in the home. Just feels good in you hand. Easy to control while peeling. Others do not give you the control due to small handles that slip when wet. You can really apply pressure when needed without the worry of the peeler slipping out of your hand. First day I got this, I used to peel potatoes for a meal I was having that evening. I have all the OXO kitchen utensils in the same drawer. This way I don't have to look for the right tool for the job. Just like all the OXO products. Some I have had for years and never have had any issues with them."
2,"Almost gave it one star, but I hate to 'hate' things...","I'm left-handed; don't know if that is the source of the problem with this peeler, but it does NOT do a good job for me. One cutting edge seems sharp, the other not. Would send it back if it were worth more, as it is I'll just pass it on."
5,Particularly Pleasant Professional Peeler,"What can I say about a vegetable peeler? It's comfortable to hold, very sharp and does all a peeler should do. Everyone should have one for those wide veggies like eggplant and zucchini and baking potatoes."
4,peeler with appeal,"very smooth action, had to get used to it at first but its head and shoulders above any peeler I have ever owned"
4,Y Peeler,"Great product. Very sharp and makes peeling easy and fast. I rated it four stars only because it's a bit large for my hand size. I'd like it to be just a bit smaller which would make it easier to grip for me. However, I compensate by placing my index finger thru the Y opening (there's plenty of room) and this allows me to control it better due to my small hand. Although I highly recommend it for someone who has larger hands, I would myself purchase a smaller one next time I needed a y peeler. The sharpness and ease of use and cleaning certainly makes this a winner!"
1,It was not as good as my cheapo peeler,"I was really disappointed. My cheapie peeler works better. It takes off a very thin layer, and misses a lot."
5,Bliss...,This is the only perfect album I have ever heard. Some songs may or may not take one or two listens but no more than that. It is the only which I own that I will listen to straight through without skipping a song. It's a shame this turned out to be their only album.
5,...a FEEL GOOD cd,Playing this cd always brings fonds memories to mind. Funny thing is all those fond memories are just of me listening to this album and the joy I anticipate when I get to listen to it next time while remembering how fun it was the last time.This is a feel good cd. Feel good now
5,Songwriting at its best.,"I am now buying my second copy of this album as I've quite simply worn the first one out. Easily in my top five albums ever, superb from start to finish."
1,waste of time,acting stinks... director was asleep... movie is trash... actor isnt qulifiedto be on the screen... some body bought his way in...
1,"Poor acting, directing, & dialogue.","This is one of the worst movies I've seen. Was the director asleep? The acting gets corny. The main actor is so arrogant that it is unbelievable that he would reach his present level of success. The trainee acts like' he has too little knowledge to be in a secret operative. Why would the gov't have an on-the-job training position like this? The dialogue is simplistic and uncreative. Fortunately, I rented it for a buck at a Redbox machine, so I'm not out much."
1,Are u kidding me?,"Got to see this on Cable TV. Or at least, about ten minutes of it before I began throwing things at the t.v. They really thought this was worthy of putting on film/tape? Uh, no. Big misfire here. Love Treach as a rapper. As an actor, he's a great rapper. Really thought the producers were out of their minds. This ""Film"", if it could be called a film, has the unique distinction of proving once and for all that rappers should not be acting. Now totally convinced they were indeed out of their minds. Horrible. Pathetic. Moronic. Trite. Abysmal. Puke. Barf. Poopy. There now, I think you get it."
1,The worst movie ... ever!,"The actor can't act. Can't even talk right... full of ghetto english. He looks stupid, acts stupid, and is probably stupid... I guess not as stupid as the director or the casting crew. I didn't get a chance to see how to movie ends... I was so bored I had to turn it off after 15' to watch the Travel channel. Anthony Treach, please craw back to the ghetto you came from and not waste any space on the shelf. Please try very hard not a act anymore, really.. honestly, you are terrible."
3,Sandpaper People,"Everyone has them, sandpaper people, those who drive us up the wall we've banged our head against. For Christians, these people are especially difficult, because knowing Christ is our role model, we can't tell them to get off the planet or bash them in the head. The author offers advice on what to do about them. She explains some of the reasons why they might be the way they are and how to deal with them in a Christian manner. Moreover, she points out that God is not surprised by anything, and so, if these people are in your life, He had a reason for putting them there. Whether you are Christian or not, if you have someone who gets on your last nerve, read this book.Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
5,Not your average riding video,"Having spent time with Carey & his family when I lived in Vegas, I was very interested how this would turn out. It's very different from most riding videos & a great look at the life behind all the hype. One of my favorite videos./TJ"
3,At least it's worth a look...,"I don't see how this is ""film-school in a book"". I've learned more about films just by watching them and acknowledging them for myself. Although, Roger Ebert does make some interesting insights, even though they are sometimes insights that I have already considered, and don't really need a book to help me point out. And Ebert have listed a couple of films that I've never heard of that I might be interested in checking out, like The Apu Trilogy and The Exterminating Angel.The Great Movies II has a listing of movies that I'd be more interested in reading, so I might check into it someday.It's an okay book and is worth a look, at least for any beginner. But it's no film-school to me. 3/5."
4,This is a great book.,Regarding one reviewer`s criticism; The attempted assassination of Regan has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH TAXI DRIVER AS A FILM. Roger Ebert is a Film Critic and not a Historian or Social Commentator...Get a grip.
2,"Book fine, binding defective","The book's content is fine, but the binding broke after 2 weeks of medium use."
1,Unnecessary,"Roger Ebert is a great movie reviewer and he is the most famous film critics in The United States, but this book will be an unnecessary waste of money. To find all these reviews, a film lover just has to go to Ebert's website on the Internet. There, the reader will find all these reviews and many more!"
3,Book has one major and horrible drawback,"It's review of the 1976 film Taxi Driver. That film was the story of a cabdriver who tries to kill a politician. The film inspired the real life attemptd murder of the President United states back in 1981. Nowhere in Mr. Ebert's pages-long revieew of the '76 film does he mention the very important real life event the movie inspired and I am very confused as to why (Ebert was a grown man when this monumental event occurred, doesn't he remember it?). But whatever the reason it undermines much of the value this book is capable of having otherwise."
4,Great Read,"This is a great read . . .What I appreciate about this text is the fact that it is not introduced as the definitive source of all great films and does not exclude non-American films from the discussion. It is simply his opnion on films that he has a high regard for aesthetic, artistic or cultural reasons.One prime example is the inclusion of ""Written on the Wind."" I recently viewed this film on DVD and was not overly taken by the movie. Basically, I did not really see why some film scholars regarded it so highly. But after reading Ebert's essay on the film, I realized that the film represented something more in terms of its impact (READ soapy melodrama) on popular culture.Overall, this book is a great companion for every film lover."
5,One of the Best from One of the Best,"Roger Ebert's commentaries on the dozens of movies discussed in this book make me want to retire from life and do nothing but watch movies! If I were younger, it might have inspired me to become a filmmaker myself. Ebert proves himself to be more than just a TV movie critic for the masses, but an incredibly informed, observant and sensitive scholar of movies and movie history. Thanks Roger, for all the recommendations; there are many I intend to be seeing over the next few months. Each four-page essay is an absolute gem!"
3,Not What I Expected,"I was hoping this would be filled with Ebert's usually well-wrtten reviews, but instead got a 450 page book filled with Ebert's columns he wrote for the Sun Times about what made these movies so good. It's OK, but lacked the usual humor and awe that his great reviews have."
3,Save My Son,"The book made a lot of since. I am a mother of an addict and I am in great pain. I too, wonder how did I lose my daughter. What can I do to get her back on the road to her best life.The story of Maralys Wills struggle with her son was something I could relate to.Therapeutic communities may be the best hope for people that suffer with this illness. I have looked into joining PATH of San Diego in hope that we, the loved ones, can make a difference in how the courts treat our addicts."
2,What is this,"Some of the tracks of Dave Pell's ""Prez Conference"" are here, but not all. ""One O'clock Jump,"" ""Jump, Lester, Jump,"" and ""Taxi War Dance"" are missing. The origin of the Joe Williams tracks is unexplained in the blank booklet that comers with the CD. Who compiled this mess? Where is the information?"
3,Good...and not so good.,"Heringman is very effective with the lute pieces, but in an attempt to provide contrasts, he strays to a particularly scratchy-sounding cittern and a rather bland bandora for several tracks. A viol is also added in a couple of places, but this has a rather sour quality to it.Program just the lute pieces and there is plenty of good quality lute music to enjoy here. But the non-lute pieces deny Heringman full marks."
1,Unusable,"I bought this press several months ago and have finally given up on it. The holes are too small! When pressing garlic, more comes up around the top than through the holes.Also, cleanup always includes poking a toothpick through the holes. My old zylzz went into the dishwasher and come out clean. This one takes 10 minutes to clean.This is the first time I've ever been disappointed in an OXO product."
2,dissappointed,"The press part worked fine, But, for clean up it DID NOT rinse out easily. I had to use toothpick to clean. It is not worth the price. Going to go back to the simpler design. I still have my reciept and are going to return it. Wish my old one of over ten years had not broke it's handle. Can't find another like it."
2,Dissapointed,"I am an advid reader of romance, but I was very dissapointed with this book. While the plot sounded interesting, it took a long time to ""get there"". It was a struggle to finish this book. I speed read most of the pages. It just did not hold my interest. I do not usually write reviews, but I felt that I needed to for this book. Not a book I would reccommend."
3,Hard to read,Love Loretta chase! Just hard to read this book.I give it 3 stars because I love the authorThe end
4,Loretta Chase,"Compte d'Esmond has desired Leila Beaumont forever, but has been unable to do anything about his feelings for the beautiful portrait painter because she's already married.Leila's faithless, drug-addicted husband is murdered and Leila finds herself accused of doing the dirty deed. She turns to the powerful Compte d'Esmond for help and soon finds herself in a passionate affair with the enigmatic aristocrat.This is book 2 in the 4 book series. Book one (out of print) is The Lion's Daughter. Book three is Lord of Scoundrels. Book four is The Last Hellion.This novel is well written and very passionate, but having read books 3 and 4 first, I found it lacking in comparison. It doesn't have the humor and wit of three and four. Still, the plot is well developed and the relationship between the hero and heroine is intriguing. This is well worth the purchase."
3,I Bit Boring Really,"I've enjoyed other efforts by Loretta Chase, but this one left me totally unengaged. I still finished it, so it wasn't one of those frustrating books you just want to throw against a wall. I think if you like dramatic romances without a lot of heat or humor, you will love this one. The loves scenes are a bit dull and I ended up just skipping over them after awhile. I'll admit I'm a fan of lighter literature. Give me some humor, maybe a clutzy (sp?) heroine or hero(or at least a not-infallible one), some misadventures (but no misunderstandings), and some leads with chemistry and I am a happy camper. This isn't a bad book, but had none of the above."
1,Ugh! Couldn't even finish it!,"Unlikable characters, dragging story line, and dark themes made this an awful read. I have read other books by this author and enjoyed them. This was just plain tedious. If you want good murder/romance read Amanda Quick."
3,Loretta makes me work hard for this one.,"I love reading Loretta Chase's work because it is so dense. You have to work through every paragraph and I don't usually know where she is going. This book was no different. However I gave this book less than a stellar rating because the heroine was far to jaded for me and I couldn't see her attraction. And the constant refusals of Ismal were disappointing. She was fighting some inner battle with herself and it was getting tedious to read it. The mystery didn't keep my attention either. OK read, just not going to read it again."
3,it was ok,"Lord of Schondrals was so good. I wished this one was the same. But the chemistry wasn't as good. The ""who done it"" was."
2,More mystery than romance.,"This book was 80% mystery and 20% romance. Although this was very well-written, I found it dragged and took too long to get to the point of it. I am strictly a romance reader and I knew by the first half of the book who the killer was.What saved COTN from being a one star, was the hero. He was one for the record books. Very sensual and mysterious. Right hero, wrong book. Lord Of Scoundrels was much better if you prefer romance to mystery."
4,Good book,"One of Chase's other books contained a reference to the characters in this one. She said something to the effect of, ""the husband lusts after d'Esmond, who's after the wife, who only wants to be left alone to paint"". Right then, I wanted to read about Leila and d'Esmond, and Chase didn't disappoint with their appearance here."
1,Sadly..............dissapointed.,"Ms. Chase is a highly talented and interesting writer. However I found this book to be just plain awful.First of all there is a lot more mystery than romance. And the plot just seems to drag on and on and on...While I enjoy heriones that are strong willed. This one bordered on ""lunatic"". I just can't like a character who throws tantrum after tantrum and even hits the hero on the head with a chamber pot while screaming that she is going to kill him. And on the next page she is in his arms.... She was just way too dark for my taste.The hero is okay. Nothing out of the ordinary and the secondary characters are just fair.If you want to read an amazing book by Ms. Chase, then ""Lord of Soundrels"" is a wonderful choice. Pass on this one...wish I had."
5,Captivated by a great story.,"Such an unusual love story. Not a forumla historical romance story. The story, the characters, the twists and turns. Hard to put down and sorry whenit ended."
3,captives of the night,"I couldn't wait to get this book, but it was out of print. It was one of the reasons I got a kindle for christmas.I had read all of the other books that were linked to this one, and absolutely loved them, I liked this bookbut not on the same level as the others.I'm still glad I got to read itSusan"
3,...,"I like Chase's ideas and plots. But I don't love the way she writes, or the way the characters are described. They were fine characters, but the way she wrote them just seemed off. Half the time I don't know what's going on in her books because she pulls characters out of nowhere and just rambles on and on about stuff no one else is wondering about.But I am keeping this book because I really liked Esmond. He didn't think anything less of Leila, he wasn't arrogant, he wasn't a lying womanizer, there was nothing really wrong with him."
4,Dr. Ross updates latest information on MPD/DID.,"Dr. Ross covers the latest in trends in therapy and treatment modalities for Dissociative Identity Disorder (formerly Multiple Personality Disorder). Dr. Ross also mounts a solid apologetic for the defense of what has continued to be a controversial diagnosis in clinical circles. Included in the book are solid therapeutic approaches and, while he does not claim to provide complete training for the novice, he does provide a very solid foundation both in his theory and practice techniques from which to have a solid basis for understanding and working with this difficult disorder.David B. Rosenthal, M.Ed., LP"
4,"The ""Bible"" of treating DID","This is many times considered the Bible of treating DID because it is so comprehensive. Now, will everything in the book apply to your treatment of a multiple? Certainly not as every system is unique therefore the therapy protocol must meet the need of the patient. Ross's book does give great starting points. He is not too clear of what to do when the lines begin to blur between therapist and client. Transference is so complicated and I dont think he devoted enough to exploring its complexity."
5,First manned launch of Apollo spacecraft.,"This was a very important mission, that tested the Apollo CSM block II spacecraft. The block II design was a redesign-after the Apollo 1 fire that killed Grissom, White, and Chaffee just 21 months prior to the launch of Apollo 7. The mission was a complete success, and encouraged NASA to make a bold leap forward-to lunar orbit with Apollo 8.The footage of preparation, launch, and the mission is just spectacular. This is the best look at a Saturn 1B launch you will ever get(multi-angle). If you've ever taken Kennedy Space Center's ""Then and Now Tour"", and been to Pad 34, you will really want this DVD set. It is among my favorites, and I just got it yesterday!"
5,Excellent and incisive critique of American charity,"David Wagner's book What's Love Got to Do With It, provides the reader to an insightful perspective on American charity. Penetrating the veneer of ""do-gooderism,"" Wagner exposes the abuses, distortions and deliberate social control mechaisms that have been a part of the American charitable entrprise since its inception. This book is a must read for anyone involved in philanthopy, social welfare service provision, or social work education."
5,from Frank Browning salon.com review,"""Wagner's concise and vivid chronicle of the rise of paternalistic American charity is a valuable handbook for anyone who wants to challenge the duplicitous nostrums that the vapid stars of both political parties have lately offered up on everything from welfare to the widening class gap to the impoverishment of public education to the more and more degraded public-health system"""
4,All-around Awesome,"This product feels sturdy in your hand. It serves its purpose, and looks good doing it. I ding it one star because of its size. I measured the desk drawer I wanted to put it in before purchasing, and compared that to the dimensions specified on Amazon. In writing it looked like it would fit, and it....did, but barely. After a bit of shoving it went into my drawer. Not a big deal, but worth noting. It really deserves a 4.5."
2,HUGE!!!,"I needed a desk organizer that I could place in my desk drawer. This seemed to be what I was seeking. However, when I got, the thing was HUGE! There was no way it could fit in my desk drawer, let alone any desk drawer. It was wide and extremely deep. I couldn't imagine anyone would want it on their desk, as it would take up so much space. I returned it ASAP."
3,love it,Very glad I purchased this book I used it for both my boys homeade purees. Love it and recommend it to anyone.
4,Nice recipes,"Nice recipes, photos, and discussions. I found myself using the same recipes from this book over and over again, as some call for items that aren't as easy to find in a small town grocery store. This is the first and only recipe book I used for making my son's baby food :)"
3,Top 100 Purees,"Not a lot of recipes... basically tells you to peel, steam and puree... I was hoping for more tips on creative recipes."
4,good reference book,"This is a great reference book for making your own baby food. The book starts with a lot more education than I expected. Proper ages to start solids and what solids to start with are discussed. Allergies are also discussed, but the recipes are not designed for children with allergies. I think this is a great book for anyone looking to save a little money by making baby food at home. I feel good about feeding my baby something that has no extra additives or ingredients and was freshly made at home. My 6 month old has only had rice cereal at this time, but I look forward to starting some of the purees we made and froze as soon as we get the doctor's ok!"
5,Just what I was looking for,"I have been using this cookbook for the past four months to create quick, easy recipes for my eight month old. We recently moved on to more varied dishes (she loved the fish with veggies and cheese and lentils with carrots and sweet potatoes among others) The recipes are easy, healthy, and delicious! I would reccomend it to everyone considering making their own baby food."
3,ok,"I could have probably found all this information for free onlin but its good to have it available anytime i need it on the counter. I wish i had more meat recipes, like just how to make plain beef, chicken, etc...basic stuff. But its great for any fruit/veggie baby food you can imagine!"
1,Big Pass!,"I bought this book on recommendation of a fellow mother and I feel like it was a total waste of money. The recipes call for ingredients like butter, fish, and citrus which I wouldn't give to my baby until 1. Also it didn't give good recommendations of the type of meats and ingredients to use for baby foods. Save your money and instead buy a pressure cooker or slow cooker, throw in meat or chicken, water, and your veggies. Cook for 10 minutes and puree."
5,great help,I love this book. It is very helpful and not only has recipes but info on the growth and nutrional needs for your baby.
2,"Pretty pictures, not a lot more for me","I feel like this is one of those gourmet books you look at, but don't do much with. I'm a pretty traditional eater and I doubt I'm going to cook up some fancy stuff (such as leeks) that I don't even eat to feed my baby."
4,Good first foods,"The layout can be a little frustrating when your just looking for a list of recipes to try out for your little one which is why I gave this 4 stars.If you don't know what are age appropriate foods though, this is a good book. The foods are simple and easy to make and there is a pretty good variety of foods for your little one to try out."
5,tasting good baby recipes,"I had tried pretty much all the recipes from this book; and both my babies really liked them. They are not the easiest eaters, but this book managed to get them eat their veggies. Use your own judgement when to include fish, tomato, eggs, butter in your children's diet, you don't have to follow Annabel's timeline. I have tried other baby cookbooks as well, and I would totally recommend this book. Easy to cook, and really tasty to eat baby recipes. You won't regret buying this one."
3,"Nice book, BUT be careful with some recipes","For example, there are recipes with fish and cheese for ages 7-9, while fish are not reccomended for babies until 2 years of age and cheese for babies until 12 months. Then scrambled eggs for ages 9-12 months - babies should not have egg whites until 12 months and the later you introduce them the better. The author might be a good cook, but she definitely doesn't know anything about what are babies NOT supposed to eat to prevent allergies and other problems."
3,Take it with a Grain of Salt...,"I could not FULLY appreciate this cookbook because I had to pick and choose around the recipes so as to be careful not to introduce certain ""hazardous"" foods too soon. The book states WHEN to introduce certain foods, but have different guidelines than what the APA is stating. Maybe because this is a British author? FOr instance, I will not be giving eggs to my baby until around 1 year. Also, some recipes call for butter or berries and other ""off limits"" foods that I plan to avoid until after 1 yr. So I wasn't able to get a 100 baby purees out of it - but I did like some ideas about what foods are good mixed together (ex. sweet potatoes and apples). And I liked her tips about freezing and storing baby foods, so not a total loss. Just take this book with a grain of salt and remember she is not a peditrician - so be sure to check with your doctor about when and what to introduce."
2,Fussy little book,"Some of the vegetable and fruit combinations were creative in this book, and it certainly has pretty pictures, but in terms of providing useful information and recipes, it was somewhat disappointing, and at times even insultingly simplistic: I.e., How to make banana mush: take a banana, peel it, and mash it with a fork and serve. Now, why would someone need to explain this in a book? I suppose if you really are at a loss in a kitchen, this book might offer some useful advice, but it is not for anyone who has even a minimum of cooking experience. Because some of the food combinations were so unique, this might be a good second or third choice for a baby food library, but I suppose I was looking for a more authoratative book with information on the whys and hows of food introduction."
3,A good starter for me.,What I liked about this book was that it was easy to understand. It had a lot of good purees but my daughter didn't care much for the older baby recipes. I didn't like that she uses a lot of butter and cheese in a lot of the recipes. It did help me to understand the concept to cooking for my baby.
4,"Very simple, well organized book!","Out of all the books I have checked out for making your own baby food, this book was the most simple & well organized of them all. It broke things down by ages/stages and was not too filled with ""Getting started"" topics. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to make their own baby food!"
5,Helpful information,Love it. Lots of ideas specially for people that hate the kitchen like me and don't have very good cooking ideas.The fact that tells you what is suitable for freezing or not is very helpful. I have tried the recipes before giving them to the baby and they actually taste good.
3,Good recipes but not for ages given!!!,"I got this book but DO NOT believe the ages! Babies ARE NOT supposed to have eggs before 1 year and she says 6-7 months. There are awesome recipes I will use though just not when she says. Also it says you MUST introduce solids at 6 months and really you don't have to in the first year if you're breastfeeding some babies aren't interested! The signs for being ready are contrary to what any nutritionist will tell you decreasing time at the breast or more frequent feedings could mean a growth spurt otr a nursing strike or something else! The true signs are that they are 6 months or older, can sit with a little support, keep their bottom lip out when a spoon is put in, and doesn't push food or spoon out with tongue. These aren't even mentioned!"
2,Don't think its worth it.,"I got this book as a gift and for a 6 month old it doesn't specify what to give your baby, just says carrots and apples...? Thats all im supposed to give my baby? And i agree with what other people are saying, don't give your baby any exra butter or oil or spices! And no fish or citrus until they are one! This is rediculous! i am sending this book back!!!!!"
1,Not helpful and give wrong-headed advice,"At first glance, this seemed like a good book to help me along with the solid food process for my baby. Then I realized that a lot of the recipes call for butter. Butter?! I don't use very much butter to cook food for myself and I really don't see why it's necessary for a 6 month old. Not to mention the suggestion of dairy and berries before the age of 1. I would not buy this cookbook. If you are looking for something healthier and very user-friendly I would go with La Petite Appetite. I'll be on the search for another baby food cookbook as well."
2,don't go by the cover. one would learn,"Well written , poorly presented. if you are a firt time parent don't bother. Ask your mother how to do it best! dont waste your money."
1,Beware!,"They suggest red berries in some of the early baby purees (6-7 month recipes)- I was just informed that it is unwise to feed babies red berries before one year of age, as they could develope an allergy.Thought I'd pass this note on!"
2,We get it -- breastfeeding is best -- can we get to the recipes now?,"The book's ok -- the recipes ok. But what began to drive me crazy is the constant drumbeat of 'breast is best'. No kidding, I know that. I have a baby and I've heard all of it.I'm so OVER all of it and ready to begin introducing my little one to solid food. Let's just stick with that, ok? That's the title of the book, right?"
4,Tasty Purees,"We were pureeing fruit for my daughter before we purchased this book. But the advantage to this book is having other options for bigger meals and what types of food to combine into one meal.We have tried several of the recipes and all have been very simple to make. The one-pot chicken has onions, sweet potatoes, carrots and chicken mixed together. My daughter had not tried chicken or onions before this meal but seems to enjoy it.I have a few small complaints about the book:1) It doesn't list temperatures for cooking2) I would have liked to see more recipes that included herbs and spices3) Many recipes include strawberries, which are not recommended for children until age 1Overall, I am very pleased with this book. It has encouraged us to make new foods for my daughter who seems to enjoy whatever we place in front of her.I would (and have) recommend this book to any parent of infant children."
5,Excellent Source of Resource,I had been looking for a book that was resourceful in terms of information about homemade baby foods. This had great recipes to start with as well as nutritional information. I'm looking forward to many happy meals with my daughter! (I also have another of the author's book which was equally excellent.)
5,A mom's must have!,I literally have used this book every day since my baby started eating baby food. He's almost a year now and I believe he is the healthiest he could be due to me making his food. I have bought this book for my pregnant friends and recommended it to other moms. You can simplify most of the recipes to make them quicker to prepare if you're short on time. Great buy!!
3,Lots of Common Sense Information,"I should have looked more closely at the dimensions and number of pages listed before I purchased this because it's just the size of a typical children's book. I was expecting a larger cookbook-sized book with more information.It's cover is well-designed and the illustrations are great, but I expected a little more substance. After reading through it, I've determined that I can just blend fruits or steamed veggies and feed them to baby. It's really that simple.Overall, it's a nice-to-have book, but I think it's one of those things that a new parent gets and later realizes really isn't necessary."
1,Terrible,"This book is very, very wrong about a lot of things. I asked my pediatrician about what I could feed my baby and a lot of things in this book he said NO. The time frame is awful. You are not supposed to give babies butter, onions, fish, eggs at 6 months of age. I will not use my book anymore and will get a new one."
4,"Quick, easy recipes","I have to say this hasn't solved my issue of not knowing what foods to introduce when...but it is an easy to use cook book. My 7 month old likes everything I've made. It is by a British author, so some of the dishes I don't recognize, and won't make, but for the most part it's really concise and easy to use; the most important attribute for a mom with a baby is quick, easy, healthy, tasty!"
3,Carrot puree,"I purchased this book and immediately tried the first recipe (the carrot puree) My 6 month baby loved the puree, but I didn't know that carrot stain is very hard to remove. It stained my baby's bib, clothes, and even her spoon! I exclusively breastfeed her and carrot is her first solid, so I didn't have any experience with stains at all. I just washed her clothes and bib in Dreft, but the stain stays. I just wish this book warned me about the stain so I could soak the clothes in Dreft before it became permanent."
4,Good overview of baby food making,I like this book. It has good information on making baby food that jives with current AAP recommendations regarding when to introduce foods. People following a more conservative feeding approach or who start solids much earlier than 6 months might not find it as useful at first.
3,Okay for the price,I was really excited for this book but found it to be anti-climatic. I was already making most of the recipes found in this book...it just takes a little common sense. It is nice to have on hand for quick reference if you are unsure on how to cook a veggie/fruit for your lil one. I didn't pay much for the book so I am satisfied. Had I paid more I would have returned it.
4,Great book! love the pictures and love the recipes!,This book is really easy to read and flip through and the pictures really help as well. I bought this along with Super Baby Foods and they seem to go good hand and hand...
4,good foundation type book,Only drawback is that the recipes don't yield very much so if you want to stock up you have to double or triple a recipe. Good stuff except some minor annoyances like using cheese and things like that too soon (in my opinion) when labeling for age appropriateness of certain recipes.
3,Baby Purees,"This is a great book, but some of the recipes are a little unrealistic for what I can/want/have the time to do! But it helped me a lot with knowing how to cook different foods before I pureed them and what was good to mix together. I also have Super Baby Food and that book was my favorite... lots of great information about pureeing, storing/freezing, and recipes!"
4,yummy,"THis book has a lot of good information on how to cook the vegetables and fruits for purees. Has a lot of great pictures and tasty recipes. The meat recipes seem pretty expensive (pork chops and lamb) to blend up for a baby, but I think I'll try those recipes out on my husband and I as well as baby"
4,Great book for new moms,"I liked the easy instructions and my little one enjoyed my efforts.You can use your blender, but I bought a little hand held one to make my baby food."
2,Disappointed,"I have had the book for a little over a month and have not opened it but once. I was a little disappointed because the first dozen recipes are simple things such as carrots, milk and cereal. One other thing that caught my attention was the precursor of the recipes give an overview of what babies shouldn't have until certain ages, for examples, a 6 month old should not have orange juice. Then one of the recipes has orange juice as an ingredient. I only skimmed through the rest of the book because my baby is only 6 months."
3,New Mom Trying New Recipes,"I got this cookbook because I wanted to make healthy food for my little man. So far I like the recipes. They are really easy to make and they make big portions. There isn't a great variety of foods for 6 month olds. I would say there are more recipes for older babies. I did like how there was information in the front of the book about making food, why make your own baby food, what to expect with your baby and so on. I would recommend this book."
2,feh...,"The price was right, but I was a little disappointed. The recipes weren't just blended fruits and veggies...there were a lot of recipes with butter and other ingredients that I wouldn't give my baby (maybe when she's a little older). Perhaps I'm one of those wierdo parents, but introducing fats and salt at such an early age gets me a little nervous. The pictures are nice though, and for an older child, I could see myself making these recipes (although, I probably wont' spend time blending them into liquids)."
3,"Pretty pictures, small portions","The pictures were beautiful and the recipes tasty, but the portions were so small that it was discouraging to do all that work and have little to show for it. Often I had to quadruple the recipe so I had enough to freeze for later. I am grateful to have the book for ideas - but I didn't always have these ingredients on hand so it required a separate trip to the store. It took a few trips to remember to purchase 4x the amount."
4,More ideas than I would think of on my own,"Making baby food seems easy - steam and puree. On my own, I could probably come up with 20 ideas, but this book has 100 viable ideas for what to feed your baby. It's a great book to find inspiration as well as education on what to feed baby."
3,50/50,"The book is ok to read, but not anything you could not have figured out on your own. I like the pictures and thoughtfulness around explaining why you give baby the foods when you do."
5,Baby Puree Book,Excited to try all these baby purees! This book is loaded with excellent recipes and colorful photos! Very happy with my order. Excellent customer service and delivery time! :)
4,Great Baby Food Book,"My sister recommended this book to me and I think I ended up making just about every recipe in it for my son! He loves the food I make for him and wont eat any packaged/jarred baby food now. I loved how she uses lots of vegetables in many of the recipes and a lot of them taste so good I would sneak bites of them for myself (or finish off my sons meal if he didn't eat it all!). My son's favorites for the meat recipes were the Creamy Chicken and Vegetables and the Braised beef with carrot, parsnip, and sweet potato. Some of the recipes are a little involved and take some time as far as chopping everything up, and a lot of times I would double the recipe so that I would have enough to freeze for easy meals later. The great thing about most of these recipes is that you have the ability to freeze them, it has made my life so much easier. I'm so glad I got this book and I would highly recommend it. I'm off to buy the finger foods one now!"
5,My baby loves the food!,"For someone who doesn't cook, its a great resource; really easy to follow! I was surprised myself, by how good the food tasted. Its 10 x tastier than baby food by Gerber. Create little gourmet foodies by sending this book out as a baby shower present!"
5,Tasty recipes!,"This book is amaaazing! We've tried most of the recipes in it, and they have all been just great, and our baby has never rejected any of them. In fact, so many of these are so delicious, that I am going to convert them to adult recipes so that everyone can eat them! I love how creative these are, compared to some other bland baby recipes I've seen (and chose not to make). They're wholesome; they expose your baby to so many delicious flavors; I think because of this, there's nothing our baby won't eat. This is the only book I've really used to make food for our baby, and now that we're on to finger foods, I will be purchasing the next book too! Don't get scared by the longer list of ingredients towards the back of the book. They're worth it - your baby will love them, and you'll want to eat the food too!"
5,Amazing book,"This books is really good.It is very quick, easy, healthy and has tasty recipes.I recommend this book for everyone.My 5 month old baby boy loves all the food prepared using this recipe book."
5,Good recipes,"I have had this for only a short time, we just started my daughter on solids. I have already used some of the recipes. I also found the introduction to be helpful as this is my first time doing all of this. The one thing is the book tells you how many portions each recipe makes. I couldn't find what a portion is so I am taking notes as I go as to how many ounces I can get from what amount of food and water mixture. So far so good!!"
4,Must have for the at home cook!,I purchased this book before our little girl arrived and we are so glad we did! You never image how fast the first few months go by and then they are moving onto solids! Our baby loved the recipes and the tips are great! I never knew that mango helps to settle tummy aches! I would highly recommend this cookbook!
4,Tasty and Easy,"One of the most helpful aspects of this cookbook is the labeling up in the corners, identifying what age group the recipe is suitable for, if it can be frozen, and how many servings it makes. Although I agree with the reviews that have taken issue with her use of fresh carrots and spinach (because of the AAP's suggestions), I have made the recipes without those ingredients and then put in canned baby food in the last steps. Overall, really tasty food with some unique and delicious combinations and easy to make."
5,Great resource,"I purchased this book when my son was 5 months old and we were just starting him on solids. We had a lot of success using it. At the time, I was not a great cook but could follow a recipe. I welcomed the advice on how long to steam a vegetable before pureeing and what fruits would taste good when mixed together. My son loved the recipes and has since become an excellent eater. Even our day care provider comments on what a good eater he is and how she believes it was because of all the great foods we made for him as a baby. You should consult your doctor on some things like the red berries, etc. but we lived on this book for the first few months after we introduced food and had no side effects from using butter or anything else. I even bought another Annabel karmel book, Superfoods, and still continue to refer to it to cook for my now almost 2 year old. I highly reccommend this to any new mom."
5,Great book!,This is a great book. We made our own baby food for the first year and our baby loved all the different recipes from this book. I highly recommend it if you plan on making your own baby food.
5,Great Book,"Great book, but maybe a bit too much ""fluff"". I have enjoyed reviewing the 4-6 months recipes, but I haven't explored the other recipes for older babies. So far, a lot of it is common sense: peal veggies, steam, add stuff, freeze. I'm looking forward to some of the other variations later in the book. I made a lot of carrots, applesauce, pears, sweet potatoes at a fraction of the cost of buying it in the store. Organic carrots cost me $2.50 and I had enough to feed my baby for weeks. Compare that to organic baby food and this wins hands down. I modified some recipes, passing on the butter and adding breastmilk to some recipes."
5,Recomends for every mom!!!,This book is a must have for all moms! I went to work right a way once I got the book. My daughter (4 months) really enjoyed watching me make her baby food. Annabel Karmel is brilliant! I have other books of hers and love them. She has great ideas for all ages and makes it fun to provide the best for your child. There is no need to go out and buy all kinds of equipment. She makes it very simple.
2,Labor intensive recipes!!,"This book has beautiful pictures and seemingly great recipes. The only problem is, most recipes require you to make homemade stock. (Babies can't eat store bought broth.) I love to cook, but boiling a chicken carcass every time I want to cook for my baby is not ideal. Some of these recipes are very labor intensive!"
3,"If you're looking for a ""How To"" this is not the book for you","What I liked about this book is it gives recipes and ideas for using meat. Meat purees seemed to be lacking in most baby food books. There are also recipes that go above and beyond the usual sweet potato and banana yada yada yada. As someone who likes to try different foods, I appreciated this. What I don't like is that the author seems to ignore the AAP's guidelines for introducing citrus, tomatoes, cow's milk and berries. Since she is based out of the UK, it may explain the differences. If your child has shown any type of food sensitivity, skip those recipes or modify them to your child's needs."
2,Ok book,A little disappointing. The recipes are not as simple as I thought. Some are not purees. I will use ideas from the book but probably won't do the recipes as described.
3,Some recipes are a bit time consuming,"There are some great quick recipes and good tips, but most of the recipes seem pretty time consuming which doesn't work for me since I've gone back to work."
4,"Nothing too ground breaking, but I really like using recipes","The recipes were good and easy, probably no combinations I couldn't have come up with on my own, but it was nice to have quantities/ratios spelled out for me. It was also nice in my sleep-deprived state to not have to try and come up with different combinations. I would definitely recommend this book for yourself or as a unique shower gift."
4,Excellent!!!,"I would recommend this book to anyone thinking of making their own baby food. It is SO easy to cook for your baby however, this book makes it MUCH simpler....and delicious! My daughter is now 8 months old and has absolutely loved every recipe I have tried from this book. I highly recommend it!"
1,Too many tomatoes,Too many tomatoes...Too much milk...Too much cheese. I was hoping for more simple dishes for veggies and meat. Tomatoes are acidic & allergenic.
4,Good basic recipes,"Easy recipes, nice photos. The recipes are conveniently broken into ranges for age-appropriateness and also an indicator of whether or not they can be frozen."
5,great book,I looked through many books so that I could make my daughter her own food. This book gives a lot of recipes. I'm happy that I chose this one.
3,Baby ate anyway,Cool book. I enjoyed reading it and did learn some different ways of processing baby foods. Common sense will help you process baby food. This book gives you different ideas.
4,HOT,"The book was basically HOT! Too bad th stories couldn't be longer. Overall I enjoyed it, lots of sizzle and excitement!"
2,Not my cup of tea.,Where is the humor that Ms. Kenyon normally adds to her writing? Was it edited out?This is a good book to determine if the series will interest you.In this case I have determined that this is a series I can skip.I'll continue with the Dark Hunters.
2,TR,"Don't bother getting this book. Boring, too much, ""saw stars."" I felt ripped off by author and I've read every one of her books at least three times.She needs to stay with her excellent Dark Hunter series. Now these are some great stores, funny, sexy books you can't put down."
3,Disappointing!,"I love Sherrilyn Kenyon, but I was really disappointed when I got home with this and then realized only one out of the three stories was new. The other two were in previous anthologies. Although I liked them the first time around, I took it back and got my money back. $7.99 is not that much in the scheme of things, but it to buy something I have already read."
1,Extremely BAD,"I look forward to buying everything and anything by Ms Kenyon. However, this book made me rethink that policy. I like a steamy story but this book took steamy into boring territory. I pride myself on finishing books started but this one was an exception. I hope Ms kenyon gets back to the dark hunter series."
5,awesome,little book in one and also it is book of the B.A.D book which are all good and there are three of them
3,Just OK!,"I have grown to love most of Sherrilyn Kenyon's work, however, I felt at times that she was trying ""a little too hard"". There were times when she just seemed to be going through the motions. It wasn't that this book of short stories (One Bad Night,Bad to the Bone and Captivated by You)were horrible, they just seemed to lack something..maybe they were too short. However, the one saving grace is the continuing story of Tee and Joe, who evetually have to get together if for no other reasons than the fans. But if you would like a quick read, with some entertaining sex scenes, read Born to be Bad."
2,Born To Be Bad? At least the title is true...,"I am a fan of Sherrilyn Kenyon's writings, but this book was just soft-core porn, and not even erotic porn! I was so disappointed while reading these three short stories. Really, I can enjoy a good (or bad) sexy Dark Hunter with everyone else, but reading about these uninspiring heroines and their sexual (but not at all sexy) encounters was just sad.I really thought the worst thing she had written prior to this was Vane Kattalakis humping Bride McTierney in Night Play, which to me read just like a National Geographic desription of how dogs have sex. Now she's just fallen into bad role-playing. I would not recommend this book to a Kenyon fan."
3,"Good Content, WAY Overpriced!","I enjoy reading the Washington Post. Currently I only get it on Sundays via Home Delivery, but was happy to try out the trial subscription.I read the post every morning on the way into work, and really enjoyed it! In general the articles were good, well formatted to the kindle and plentiful... I became hooked.I was SHOCKED to see that the monthly subscription price was so high, and have decided that the Kindle version is not worth the price.Sad."
2,Too expensive and missing content,"I was excited to start receiving the Washington Post on my Kindle, we currently have home delivery but so often never get around to reading the paper. With the Kindle version I did find myself reading the paper more but the price is outrageous. It costs more than the home delivery edition without all of the content. Very disappointed, will not be continuing with the subscription once the free trial period ends."
2,Still Missing Newspaper Essentials,"I just canceled my subscription after 4 weeks because:1. I would not get the edition downloaded on my Kindle until after my commute.2. The articles contain some pictures but never graphs or charts. For example, the printed version had a listing of the ranking of Government agencies with respect to climate survery. The Kindle version did not.3. While they have added letters to the editor, it is still missing comics, crosswords, soduku, sports box scores, standings and a lot of other information that makes a newspaper a newspaper. It has obituaries but not box scores! Come on.I'll go back to picking up the Express on my way to the Metro platform."
3,Magazine appears to be missing,"The new layout for Kindle newspapers is very well thought-out and a pleasure to read.The Sunday edition appears to be missing the Sunday Magazine. The New York Times has its magazine.I would very much like to have the option of a Sunday-only subscription but I am content with manually purchasing it every Sunday.I really want the Sunday magazine back.**EDIT** The May 1, 2011 edition does have the Magazine again."
2,Sloppy!,"The Washington Post has the reputation for excellence in journalism, but you wouldn't know it from the digital edition. I've never seen the print edition (I don't live in Washington), and would never look for it now. Echoing the comments of other reviewers, the layout is sloppy and confusing and the typos are everywhere. The editors/owners obviously have their heads in the sand with respect to the future of print journalism. I canceled after the first month."
1,Unable to Download,"Despite multiple attempts, I have been unable to download the Post to my tablet with the Kindle app. I just got a new tablet, so we'll see if that helps."
2,Not worth it,The edition I purchased on a Sunday had many of the same articles from the day before. Would rather have a real copy of actual paper.
2,Same price as print but with less,We love the Post. Mornings would not be the same without it. Post on the Kindle seems a perfect match.....OK...so....what happened to half the paper? No comics. No puzzles. The style section is a ghost of the print version. Very very few pictures. Sure no ads but way too much is lost. Heck I can whispernet to the web for better daily news for free. Make the Kindle version more like the print version or don't bother.
3,"If you don't get it, you don't get it","I am still on my trial subscription, but the Kindle version of the paper is a hit for me. I am a 'scanner' and don't read many of the articles. The Kindle version is perfect, as it allows me to scan by hitting 'next article'. If the article catches my eye, I read it.No paper littering the house, no ink issues, simple and portable. This is a win for me."
3,Opinions?,I like the Kindle Post version for the most part - I see the Editorial area but I do not see Opinions which are viewable on the internet - IE Dan Balz Ezra Klein et al. Are they not included?
3,Not great on Kindle Android app,"Updated--I'm trying the Post subscription through the Kindle app for my Nexus tablet. It's not fully functional. The previous/next article buttons don't work, and neither does the the All Articles button. Have to press the Back button to get to the home page to choose a new article.I read the Post on the Metro, and also get a home delivery for my wife. I obviously don't need it on the weekends. I'm only saving $3.50 a month ($13/month for the Kindle vs $16.50 - 22 newsstand copies at the Metro at 75 cents each). Is the $3.50 savings worth it not to have the feel of a real paper? Not really."
2,no editing functions...,"The potential deal breaker for me with this Kindle WP PAID subscription is the lack of editing functions, cutting, pasting, and especially not being able to email an article. Ironically I can go to the free webpage and do those things. I've complained and if this isn't fixed in a reasonable length of time I guess I'll go back to the free webpage. Incidentally I have the FREE WP app on my iPod touch and it has all the editing functions that are missing from this which i presume is an Android product."
2,Not a good value,"I have been a Post subscriber at home for many years. Not only am I a fan of the paper I even had a delivery route when I was a teenager. I am now trying the Kindle version but as much as I enjoy the content I just can not understand why this is as expensive as it is. I think they will severely limit their audience at $14.99 a month. I would actually like to get a number of different newspapers as I enjoy reading differing points of view. If they were each under $5 that would make a lot more sense. Seems to me this entire business model may be obsolete anyway once the iPad comes out. I may be missing something but at that point if it allows web browsing I would be able to go to ANY newspaper site, see the entire site (lets face it the Kindle versions are quite limited as compared to a live web site), and for whatever the monthly charge is I can get every newspaper i have the time to look at. $14.99 a month for a stripped down version just doesn't cut it."
1,What A Disappointment,"I LOVE the Washington Post. I have been reading it since I was 10 years old. So, I was very excited to see it was available on the Kindle. I immediately got a trial subscription. Boy, was I disappointed.Most of my favorite items, such as comics, The Reliable Source, Real Estate Matters, are not included in the Kindle version. The way the paper is formatted is also not what I expected. Titles are missing and, well, it just doesn't LOOK like the paper.I am, very unhappily, canceling my Kindle subscription and waiting until it is a better product."
1,problems,i have not received my kindle version of the post today i have received past issues of the kindle version of the post and i have bought books with my kindle today who do i contact if i dont receive my kindle version of the post??
2,Too provincial.,"I am not from Washington, but enjoy good media. Unfortuntely, the Washington Post is mostly about politics, or the Redskins and other local stories pertient only to Washington DC. Whereas the NY Times is more international, and the Wall Street Journal is very business oriented but at least national, the Wash. Post is very narrow. I unsubscribed."
3,Delivery of Kindle edition often delayed,"The Kindle Edition of the Washington Post would be great except for one thing. At least two mornings a week, I receive a message from Kindle stating that delivery of the paper has been delayed. Often this is just for an hour or so, but sometimes the paper never comes at all that day. This makes reading the Post on Kindle a lot less convenient than it could be."
4,Reasonable morning paper,"I love to read a paper first thing in the morning with a cup of coffee. My local paper has started being delivered too late for me to read, so I got the Post as a replacement. It is a reasonable paper. It's nearly always there by 5:30 eastern time, and has interesting articles from a national point of view. I tire of the liberal bias that creeps in, but it is really not too heavy-handed (much better than my local paper). If you need to read a paper in the morning and you live on in the eastern US, this will probably serve you."
3,Too little content,"I live in a very rural area of Nebraska. Because of this I'm unable to get the Washington Post on a daily basis. When I purchased my Kindle I was happy to be able to get this newspaper on a daily basis delivered to my device. The editions I did receive were a small percentage of the actual edition. Very dissatisfied, canceled subscription"
3,Newspaper on a screen was not my thing,I didn't like reading 1/4 page at a time. Not being able to put my fingers between pages to quickly flip back and forth was another minus for me.
2,Where are the funnies?,"It costs a fortune to buy the Washington Post here in NY City, so when I saw it was available on my Kindle, I immediately took a trial subscription.It was only then that I discovered the ""Kindle Version"" of most newspapers, including the Post, are castrated versions of the real thing.After seeing how the original Kindle handles graphics (ie, badly), I blame neither Amazon nor the Post for not including photo- and graphics-rich sections. But now that the DX is here, I have just one question:Where are the funnies?"
1,Where's the introductory offer?,"So I started to subscribe to the paper edition of the WAPO, have it delivered on Sundays for this price ""26 weeks of Sunday home-delivery for just 77 a week - a 62% savings off the newsstand rate!"" Sounded good but then I thought, better if I get it on the Kindle, but alas the Post doesn't think Kindle users want the same type of intro offer? What is wrong with this picture, a digital version costs more than the paper version?"
3,Good but No Comics,"I liked the format and the ease of navigating through the articles. However, one of the things I really enjoy about ready a newspaper is, after all the serious news of the day, ending with the comic section. I was very disappointed when I got to the Style setion and found everything but the Comics. If I'm paying the newspaper price, I expect the complete newspaper. Add in the comic section and you'll have me for life."
4,The price doesn't match,"The price of The Washington Post is 75 cents in kindle store for current issue. But after I bought it, 2 bucks were subtracted from my credit card.What's wrong?"
2,No delivery,"Day 2 of my subscription. It's 1030 am and have not received today's download, so far not too impressed."
1,Hate It,You folks keep trying to jam me with a subscription to The Post. I do not want it and resent how you do it.
1,No comics,"Home delivery is not practical for me. I was expecting to use the Kindle version of the Post as a replacement for having to pick up a paper copy every day. Huge dissapointment. Without the comics, it is a non-starter. If I could rate it zero stars, I would."
1,worst article descriptions,forget about it. the descriptions of the articles are so hopeless that subscribing is futile. i am going to give up on the free trial.
1,just junk,"I'm sitting here at McDonald's with the free wifi for the last hour and one-half, waiting for my puchase to download. It must a voluminous purchase, or it doesn't work. I don't have three hours to wait for my single copy to show up on my Ipod, so I will go home and ask for a refund."
3,2 thirds blue 1 third red,"The odd photo would be helpful in some cases and the Post has seen the light by becoming a little more balanced with their reviews and Editorials, more would be better though.All and all however,a good job."
5,None,The Post on the Kindle is perfect for keeping up on vacations and trips. If only I could just _transfer_ my print subscription...
3,"Good, but....","I like getting the Washington Post on my Fire every morning. But I just downloaded the free USA Today (and I hate the USA Today paper newspaper!).Washington Post: good articles, good writing, covers what I want.USA Today: I can copy, email, or Facebook ""like"" an article and share it.Why can't I do that with the Post? I can't even just highlight an article or mark something as important and come back to it later. I end up taking a screen shot of my Fire with my phone so I can share an article."
2,What happened to the Washington Post on Kindle?,"I have been receiving a kindle subscription to the Washington Post for well over a year and recently I have been really disppointed with the quality of the material I am receiving each day. There are far too many typos to count and the spacing between words is often non-existent. The errors are really interfering with my enjoyment in reading this newspaper on my kindle. I also receive the Wall Street Journal on my kindle and this paper is tranmitted perfectly, so obviously the fault lies with the Washington Post. Unfortunately, if there isn't improvement I will have to cancel my subscription."
2,More than double a paper subscription,"The actual Washington Post costs about $4.45 a month, less than half the Kindle subscription and you actually get everything in the paper (as opposed to the incomplete Kindle version).The Kindle subscription may be good if you're out of the local area and just want the Post pushed to you (as opposed to looking at their website), or if you're such a gadgeteer that you can't stand to handle paper.As with much of the Kindle content, the cost isn't in line with a non-physical product. After all, the Kindle edition doesn't need ink or paper and doesn't need to by physically delivered.Shouldn't a Kindle edition be cheaper than the actual physical newspaper? Sadly, it's substantially more and doesn't even have all the content."
2,Disappointed,"Today I received my Kindle 2, cancelled my paper delivery of the Washington Post, and started my subscription of the Kindle delivery of the Post. I don't think I will keep it past the trial period. I compared the Kindle version vs. the paper copy. Much fewer pictures (some not the same in both versions), no comics, no ads at all (not necessarily a bad thing), etc. I'm keeping my paper subscription through the weekend to see how they do Parade & the Magazine; but I'm not hopeful. If the Post is going to be this sterile I will check out the other Kindle options. I'm not going back to paper. Any suggestions from others out there?"
3,Great WP Content - Lack of Graphics,"The articles of most of the Wash Post daily paper addition is here. What you do miss is the great layout and superb graphics, photos, and maps the paper has. If this is important you might rate it less stars. That being said it is not a complete replacement for the paper addition but does well in a pinch."
5,Dope album.,"Another solid Atoms Family release. From the crew that gave us Cannibal OX, Hangar 18, etc... Can't wait for more releases by Cryptic One. Buy this album it's dope, and the insert art is crazy."
5,the best reference book currently on the market,"Finally, a ""power"" reference book aimed at real Developers. Well-organized and chock-full of useful information. Fills in many of the gaps in the existing Lotus documentation. A must-have if you're into serious Domino development.Bob Pratico R5 PCLP"
4,Good Reference Work for your Notes Library,"I purchased the book recently, and I am about 100-pages into reading it. I found it very helpful and not just for reference. The code snippets are handy too. I am also noting which properties or methods are part of R5. I recommend it to any developer of Notes applications."
5,This a reference book and not for beginners,"If you are new to LotusScript do not buy this book. This is a reference book for LotusScript and Java classes and a very good one at that. The developer help files can be confusing at times and it always helps to have a reference book near you.If you are an intermediate or experienced Notes developer this is a terrific book, I have it by my desk all the time.If you want a book to teach you LotusScript but Practical LotusScript it's great!"
4,TWISTED!!,"Need i say more, i think that the song 'Twisted' is more than enough to sell the entire album! it RULES!"
2,Inaccurate.,"This was the only large metric T square that I could find commonly available in the U.S. The head was riveted to the main beam .5 mm off, rendering it useless. I drilled out the rivets and reattached the head to the beam with bolts. Don't buy this piece if your not able to true it yourself.Other than the lack of accuracy, I have had no problems with it."
1,Missing the Point,Why does race matter to Christians? Skin color has nothing to do with the message of God and his son Jesus Christ. Nothing. This book confuses Christians with a focus on ancestry in relation to skin color while missing the point that Jews could be purple and Jesus green and that does not change the message and God's word.
4,Great Read / classic,"A wonderful portrayal of life in San Francisco of the past. Gay culture just getting a strong hold, free-love was the theme.Like watching a movie from the past..but even better."
5,I Just Love it!,"What does it mean to be human? To love your fellow human beings and pardon their failings...up to a point,that is. Check Norman Neal Williams and Beauchamp and you'll know what I mean.But I've rarely read a novelist whit so profound a understanding of human nature,whit such piety,and whit such a clear mind on what kind of behaviour just can't be tolerated. The behaviour of those who won't respect their fellow humans rights and freedom. The unkind,selfish,cruel and uncaring. Armistead Maupin's stories are a masterpiece on the study of human soul, and of the complex interaction of individualities each one seeking his of her realization.His comedie humaine is far superior, for his empathy, to the cold,harsh and pessimistic stories of some celebrated minimalists of our time."
5,Thoroughly engrossing!!,"A friend loaned me the series which I read at break-neck speed. I literally could not put them down - and was duly heckled about it. It was not possible to remain aloof from the lives of these characters and the more I was engrossed, the more I wanted the story to continue. Unfortunately, there was an ending; but I often wonder, did Brian end up with that girl? Oh, yeah, it's just a book!"
5,Thank you!,"Thank you Armistead! The Tales of the City series brought me more enjoyment than I can explain. Everyday, on my way to work, I expect to see Michael or Mona or best of all, Anna as I walk by the Filbert steps. This series truly brings to life the joy of San Francisco living. Thank you!"
5,FANTABULOUS!!!,"Ever read a book that really, really could be called ""compelling""? Well, here's one, the complete series of ""Tales of the city"". It is so compelling, that I now find myself living in San Fransisco. Truly"
3,It is a must but...,"First, for all readers: I'm french, so I'm sorry for the mistakes... Like everybody I just love these book. What I really appreciate is that there is no all-good or all-bad character. But, if I understand the sociologic advantage of telling that they drink Evian water (for example), I think it's just too much: I don't feel like to know what powder each character uses to clean his carpet! Basically, this book is the book of the 70s and 80s american society."
1,Not for me,"This item keeps showing up . I hate it! Am sure it is fine for others, it is just not my style at all and it is annoying that it keeps showing up."
4,Heavy story but enjoyable book,This book is both sad and upbeat. I felt bad for Twig because she is in a bad place and I want things to work out for her. I think it is a good book for 9-12 year olds.
3,Not the best book on this subject,"After reading that perfect book ""Common Sense Construction Law"" by Smith, Currrie and Hancock LLP, I wanted to learn more about construction claims and bought this book. However I am very disappointed. I can definitely say that this is not the best book on this subject."
4,mitochondrial diseases at a glance,"It s very useful book for generalists, pathologists and neurologists."
3,Pretty Good DVD,"This was the first in the Viva La Lucha series and is a good disc. None of the matches are five-star classics, but for die-hard wrestling fans its worth checking out. Be warn that a couple of bouts are clipped which is my only real gripe."
2,A fair read with almost something more...,"To be fair this is a good book. On the other hand I did not find it action packed. I do want to however recommend this book to the reader looking for a more REALISTIC point of view of a great disaster or your Armageddon.Set in modern times, a number of great earthquakes destroy modern earth and change the landscapes. Seas are gone, new lands appear, etc. The author does a good job of painting a picture of victums in the ruins of houses and buildings during the disaster and I liked this best about the story. If you are from the islands neer or on England you will really love this book as it describes the small islands near England and will probably move you more that someone land locked here in the middle of farm land USA."
5,I agree - where's three!,My whole family loves this series. It is so much better than most of the stuff that is on TV today. We've watched Season 1 and Season 2 a couple of times now. Now we are waiting for Season 3. But I have not heard anything about this coming out on DVD. I sure hope it does.
4,"Loved Season Two, but where's Season Three?????","Ellen Season Two was released in Feb 2005 and still there's no word for Season Three. Do we have to wait a year for the next one??? I love Ellen, it's a hilarious show and I would love to see much much more!!!"
5,If you missed it the first time.,"I would watch the Ellen show every now and then when it was originally aired but never really noticed how good of a show it was. I recently borrowed the first season and found it to be very funny and the second season was even better. When they expanded on the characters and made them more part of the show it gave you even more of what you wanted. At times you can sense the familiar flavour of Seinfeld since Tom Cherones was involved in both shows, but it is Ellen's style of humor and personality which really stand out. If you missed Ellen the first time around I would very much recommend you give it a try. After all, how much ""reality tv"" and night time game shows do we really need to see."
1,"WARNING to, my deaf and hard of hearing friends","Be aware that A&E, showing great ignorance, has stripped the Closed Captioning from this series (in fact they did this to most of thier DVD releases-- From The Saprano's to Monty Python). How thoughtless, stupid, or cheap, can they be?"
3,When this book was written it was the only guide to Alaska,Excellent reference for climbs on every mountain throughout Alaska and the Yukon. Boyd even lists multiple climbs on mountains that have not yet been climbed today on peaks seldom if ever visited. The downside of this book is the information is 20 years out of date and the advice on organizing an Alaskan expedition are at times antiquated. There is a lot of information given for being such a small book.
2,Smaller than stated. Did not hold up.,"This product seemed less sturdy than the other Vermont style toys. Our small dog pulled it apart in a matter of a few minutes of chewing. Also, the product is not 8 x 8 x 2. What we received was at best 6 inches long, maybe 1.5 inches wide, and perhaps 2 - 2.5 inches high. Overall, it was a disappointment."
2,destroyed within a day,We used to buy Vermont Chew man products for our black Lab and they lasted well. Not this one. the puggle destroyed it within a day.
4,"Funny, sad, down-to-earth: real.","Very much enjoyed this book & the sympathetic protagonist. Whit's SUCH a decent guy, with good instincts & wisdom, he just doesn't know it yet. So being 13 & awkward, he makes mistakes that made me cringe with recognition. Not knowing how to confront his bigoted friend, though he's disgusted & disillusioned...making wrong, goofy romantic moves...unsure how to deal with his obviously suffering mom. Lots of uncomfortable stuff that, like real life, doesn't get totally resolved but DOES lead to growth & change. Super author & book - look forward to reading more!"
5,Vail Does It Again!,"Rachel Vail definately rememebers what it's like to be a teenager! Throughout 'Do-Over' the scenes come back to you, remembering friends, family issues, and those new relationships! Bound to make you smile and laugh all the way!"
3,A normal kid trying to grow up,"A Review by StevenWhit the main character in the story I don&#65533;t know why but he has a problem with girls. I think he should just ask a girl to go out with him. He is also having a hard time with his parents because they are getting a divorce. I know how he feels because that has already happened to me, but he is just a normal kid trying to grow up in a teenage life.One part I think is funny about this book is how whit has so much trouble trying to get a girl to go out with him. He is so clumsy when it comes to talking to girls that I find it quite funny.One part I don&#65533;t like about the book is that whit&#65533;s parents are getting a divorce. It really hurts him. But he will get over it soon. Another part that I disliked is that he finally when he gets a girlfriend she dumps him instantly and goes out with his other friend.I would recommend this book to 8th graders to about 10th graders who like dramatic and yet funny books."
1,Painful to watch,"This was so awful. Words cant describe how ...in a word, LAME this was! Every scene was so contrived. I think a 14 year old could have written this more smoothly. Just awful. 2 hours of my life ill never get back!!"
5,Classic Movie Making,"I loved it...better than the first. Guy Ritchie knows what he's doing. The characters are well developed and Downey and Law deliver top notch performances full of fun and laughs. It's built on good writing accompanied with a classic Warner Brothers' soundtrack while the special effects dazzle and add to the realism of 1891.WATSON""You do seem...""HOLMES""Excited?""WATSON""Manic.""HOLMES""I am.""WATSON""Verging on...""HOLMES""Ecstatic?""WATSON""Psychotic.""So, this review can be summed up as thumbs up!"
5,"twisty, amusing and fun","In turn: twisty, amusing and fun. I greatly enjoyed it! Unlike other Sherlock Holmes takes, this film emphasizes Sherlock Holmes' training in martial arts and other forms of defense. It is less cerebral and more action packed. I think it is actually truer to the stories than others I have seen. Both RobertDJ and Jude Law are great in these roles. I really enjoyed this."
3,Not as Good as the First One,"Plenty of twists and turns, but the non-stop, seemingly unending fight/chase scenes are overdone and boring at times. We enjoyed the first movie much more than this one.Mdv"
3,A good movie gone bad,In general I enjoyed the movie. However what ruined it was the continual use of stop action slow motion. While the director was trying to show Holmes thought processes it just ruined the flow of the movie. It would have been much better if done at regular speed and treated more like a flashback.This whole stop action slow motion thing seems to be taking over a number of movies. Much like autotune being used on almost every pop song it's over use ruins as opposed to enhances the final product.
5,Excellent,"With a different take of the classical Sherlock Holmes series, this one was action packed. It was completely enjoyable and entertaining."
3,Shadowy and a little confusing,Definitely better the second time around. This is one of those movies where sometimes you just don't get it on the first watching.
1,5 star movie but 1 star for garbage ultraviolet,"I hope the message is loud and clear by the reviews ultraviolet is not a true digital copy. I don't want to have to be dependent on an internet connection for a ""digital copy."" I really wanted to purchase this blu-ray but refuse to purchase due to ultraviolet replacing what should have been a true digital copy."
2,Choice of versions,I did not purchase this version of the product because I have no desire to purchase the digital download option for the movie. I have not seen the movie and do plan to purchase the version without the digital download option.
1,Boycott UltraViolet Downloads,DO NOT SUPPORT ULTRAVIOLET!Their format is not compatible with all digital and streaming devices. It is not compatible with APPLE TV.DO NOT SUPPORT ULTRAVIOLET!I'll wait to see it on HBO or buy it on iTunes.DO NOT SUPPORT ULTRAVIOLET!
1,Movies great but what happened to digital copy,The ultra violet digital copy is a great idea but it has horrible customer support. iTunes digital copy worked well why change to something that is less user friendly why can't we have digital copy?
3,Rewrite of Sherlock Holmes,"This movie has quite a rewrite of Sherlock Holmes. In this he is an action hero, fighting physically and a joker. As a character quite different than the one expects of Holmes. Much of his performance just seemed so out of character that it ruined the story for me. I confess I did not like it.The best actor by far who was was Jared Harris who played very well. I thought he did a good job playing Moriarty. Not that I thought that anyone acted badly. They all did their bit.The filming was good. The action scenes well doneThe story itself, I thought was weak, full of holes that made it unrealistic.I think the script writers for me, let it down."
2,availability,"I never write reviews, but I had to speak up. I read all the issues with ultraviolet and made the decision to buy the Blu ray copy only. I put it in my cart and determined that buying the copy WITHOUT the extra dvd and Ultraviolet (the cheaper one ) was a 10 to 13 day ship! the copy that they want you to buy ships immediatly! What A rip-off.I will be deleting this purchase. Walmart here I come."
5,Sherlock Holmes,The movie was great. I have always been a fan of Sherlock Holmes and loved the interpretationof this one. Have already ordered the sequel. Worth watching.
2,Not what I expected,When we rented this movie we thought it would be as good as the original. It turned out to be only an OK movie that was sometimes confusing and hard to follow. Even the humor was many times difficult to understand.
2,I thought that this was a let down after the first one,"Acting was great. The movie looked good, but didn't have any heart of emotion. The action scenes looked good, but didn't draw you in. Wish they had taken more time to develop this based on how well I liked the first one"
3,Sherlock HOlmes A Game of Shadows,It was just ok. I didn't think it was as goodas previous Sherlock Holmes that I've seen.I loaned it out and her comments were a littlebetter than mine.
2,A game of boredom,"I went in with high expectations for this movie because I really liked the first one. The movie had some of the same elements that made the first one so good, but it seemed to drag on longer than it should have been. Towards the end I couldn't wait for it to be over. I'm sure that others will rave about it but it wasn't for me. I will go into any future movies with more caution."
2,Cool actors. Visually stunning. Still horrible.,Love Sherlock Holmes. Love Robert Downey Jr. Love Jude Law. Visually stunning movie. So why was it so horrible? There was no story! Evil genius wants to kill the people Holmes cares about. That's it. There's nothing else to it. Couldn't they have taken 1% of their budget and spent it on a screenwriter?
3,Not as good as the first.,"I really thought that this movie was a let down after the first one. It was ok, but ""ok"" does not justify over two hours of movie."
2,Horrible little movie,"Haven't been so disappointed by a sequel in a while. Incoherent and overplayed, it is nothing like the first one. Will never pay to watch a third one."
5,See this movie If you are or not a fan of Sherlock Holmes,"The original Sherlock Holmes by Arthrur Conan Doyle was an eccentric genius that could master any craft he undertook, which is why Guy Ritchie's (see all his movies) version, plot and characters are believable (In this day and age plots (and books) are like long tweets. No one reads them). It is also great story telling, pure macho, fun, opera, romance, all the characters, male and female are fully developed, great in an engaging plot that moves fast, never lets up. For Sherlock Holmes fans, I also suggest Preston and Child's (keep you on the edge of your seat) Agent Penderghast, series, a modern day Sherlock Holmes. He's the man."
1,Sherlock Holmes - NOT!,"This movie has nothing in common with the original Sherlock Holmes except the 1890s London setting and the names of three characters, who are completely mischaracterized. The competing brilliances of Holmes and his brother Mycroft are completely missing. Turning Holmes into an accomplished, brawling martial artist is so misplaced that they may as well have cast Dwayne Johnson in the title role. Idiotic in the extreme.Arthur Conan Doyle would be mortified."
5,Best sherlock movie,You need to see this and the other sherlock movie that robert downey did . EXCELLENT well done MUST SEE
1,Great movie... UltraViolet is not a digital copy,"Like everyone else is saying, UltraViolet is not a real digital copy of the movie. Their customer support is just as horrible."
1,wow this was terrible,"terrible movie. I do not recommend. I like some awful stuff, but this is just ridiculous. I like ""entertaining"" movies... I consider them different from ""Good"" movies...this was neither... just bad bad bad."
1,Simply not as good as the first one.,"...from the overall storyline to the action sequences, I just didn't think this was as good as the first one."
1,WORST EVER!!! DONT BUY FROM THEM!!!,I purchased a DVD with UltraViolet Digital Copy in the title of the the purchase product. I got what I considered a good deal for $7.99 plus shipping. When I received the product the UltraViolet Code had already been used. I sent it back for a exchange and instead of exchanging the product they simply refunded me $3.99 plus $1.99 for shipping. This is all I will receive back because it is Amazons rules. Worst deal ever!!!
1,Just an excuse for violence; no real mystery and sleuthing.,This movie is just an excuse for needless violence. Where is Sherlock's skill as a brilliant sleuth? I'll stick with Jeremy Brett!
1,Not Good,"disappointing i was expecting more story, the fight scenes were tired. definitely a yawner.if you're absolutely bore with nothing to do don't watch this."
2,Great action but no plot,"I am a big fan of Robert Downey and Jude Law, and they both give good performances in this movie. The special effects were cool, but that was about the only thing this movie had going for it."
2,too Hollywood,I thought the parts where Sherlock Holmes uses extreme martial arts were too extreme and unbelievable. I couldn't even get through the movie because it was just one Hollywood stunt after another.
2,This is some comical parpdy spoof -- NOT Sherlock Holmes,"I know this is a little late, but tonight for movie night we rented the 2nd Sherlock Holmes movie that so many people raved about.Ouch ... this was painfulAll 6 people at my home yelled out .. ""GONG"" about 30 minutes into it.Wonderful sets and wardrobe ......... but it was like slapstick humor.Too goofy, like a parody.We were waiting for Jerry Lewis and the 3 Stooges to jump out at anytime.It was NOT Sherlock Holmes, it was some comedy spoof.It seemed to be nothing but an endless romp of fight scenes done in s silly comical way.The whole group of us voted to eject it and stop watching it."
3,pay attention,"this was a movie i thought id love but truly found it too hard to follow. good movie, but took more effort than i would have liked."
3,Great Movie - ultraviolet sucks,"i had resisted the ultraviolet ""digital copy"" for quite some time but figured I'd try it out. what a hassle. after three registrations, finally got it to play on my ipad but the picture won't sync with the hdmi relay like every other digitial copy does. Blu-Ray quality is fine, like always, movie is what i expected, the ultraviolet just really is lame."
2,Ultraviolet is not a bonus,"I love this movie but I am not happy with the UltraViolet copy. I cannot use it with iTunes to transfer the file to my iPod classic and UltraViolet is unable to work with me on the issue, just telling me how I could use it if my device was newer and could support apps. Not helpful.I will never buy another movie with an UltraViolet (not digital which I could use at my discretion) copy. I am very disappointed."
3,Disappointing sequel to an awesome 1st run,"I rented this last night, excited about finally getting to see it. I found myself wondering when it would end. I absolutely love the dynamic between RDJ and Jude Law, but this movie falls flat everywhere else. I don't think Moriarty was at all interesting. He's supposed to be an evil genius, right? He had none of the villainous intrigue that Mark Strong had in the first movie.Overall, I would rent it if you loved the first one, but definitely wait for it to be on special."
3,"OK, but not as good as the first","This was entertaining, but having high expectations set by the first movie, this one was a bit disappointing. The acting was still as good as ever, but the plot just was a bit over the top in that it seemed that the director wanted to top everything that went on in the first movie."
3,Disappointing,The action scenes were good but over all I was let down by the movie. I found the pace too manic and the plot weak.
3,Watchable,"I thought this better than the first one but there is still something lacking, and if you try to watch this without having watched the first film you will possibly get lost as they do not fill you in."
4,Fun!!,Enjoyable movie and great acting!Kind of like a very old 007 movie.It would be nice to see a third.
5,Great movie,"I love Robert Downey Jr.! This is a great take on a classic story! Exciting and fast paced, but classic Sherlock were it makes you think!"
2,"Lovely visuals, but the story gets lost","Loved the cinematography, art, costumes, even the characters, but the story got lost in the ""slow-mo"" previews of the fight and the special effects editing, which made for a slow, rather boring story despite the many adventures, blowups and near misses by the heroes. There were some beautiful things about the film, but not to capture me."
5,Sherlock Holmes a favorite,I love the chemistry and wit and humour between Robert Downey Jr. & Jude Law. You get the feeling they are longtime friends as they seem so natural. It really make the movie worth seeing.
5,Just as good as the first movie,"Family got me involved with this series. I watched the original Sherlock Holmes - Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon with actors - Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce (1943) and truly enjoyed the movie. Of course, now you have Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law which work excellent as partners solving crime. Plus, the action and Downey's sarcastic attitude, just complement the movie."
3,It's all right ...,"Lots of action. Too much action. Not enough smart dialogue and interesting plotting. However, I've wasted two hours in worse ways..."
5,True Holmes,Holds true to the classic Sherlock Holmes story while given a fresh look from Madonna's former hubby. One Great movie!
5,Sherlock holmes,My husband loved our gift. I searched all over for the best price I could find and had to have it in time for Xmas :)Highly recommend this shipper
4,Gripping...,An intriguing drama that builds up to an exciting climax.I viewed this on my laptop and was impressed with the video quality. I did not encounter any buffering issues.
4,excellent movie,"Nothing to do the other night , rented Sherlock Holmes from amazon , enjoyed the movie and the streaming was flawless in hd quality."
5,Favorite movie,This is in my top 10 movies. THis is even better than the first one. It got to me fast and I was able to enjoy it in the condition of brand new. No problems.
1,"Just awful, not worth watching","As a kid I loved the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle stories and I wound up loving the original Guy Ritchie Sherlock Holmes -- Sherlock was tougher, funnier and hilariously played by Robert Downey Junior. Unfortunately this sequel loses the entire point of a Sherlock Holmes story: he's supposed to use his idiosyncratically brilliant deductive powers to solve mind-bending mysteries. In this movie Sherlock is more of an action figure who fights all the time, pursues a sloppy plot of international intrigue blah blah blah, and never solves anything. It's pretty sad: it turns out that a Sherlock without a confounding murder mystery is just an irritating twit with a few mildly colorful sidekicks. In a word: avoid. See the BBC production instead, it's far more Sherlock."
1,Sherlock Holmes: a game of shadows,"This moviE SUCKS, it was so slow and boring that I could not even bring myself to watch the whole thing, watching the trailer was far more enjoyable that the movie its self. Do yourself a favor and save your money dont rent this movie unless you cant sleep and need very much to get some rest, in that light the movie works GREAT!"
1,Better than a sleeping pill,"This movie put me and my wife to sleep. Its a classical example of don't make sequels. Boring!! One positive note for the movie, we learned to use our game console instead of Roku."
2,No iTunes Code...,"Dont be fooled by 'Digital Copy' language I just received. No iTunes code. Clearly says on back of box. I would not have ordered had I know and opened. I would have bought directly from Apple, as I believe BluRay will be the VHS of tomorrow and digital is the only thing to own..."
1,Same problem as everyone else -Ultravoilet,"Movie is great, love it! It is as good as the first one. Good, fun entertainment.The rest of this is directed at Warner Brothers.Pay attention! Your company exists as long as we the customers are satisfied with your product. We Are Not! You made a mistake with Ultraviolet. Don't compound the issue by going down with the ship. Cut your ties and go back to the way you used to do digital downloads which worked just fine. I am not going to download 3 different programs onto my computer, sign up for 2 different websites, and then download an App onto my iPhone just to watch a movie that I should be able to just punch in 1 code and have the movie that I paid for downloaded and available on my iPhone, computer and Apple TV. Fix this and THEN I will buy more of your products."
1,Missing features in Single Disc version!,"Be careful, the listings and packaging for the ""Movie only edition"" don't mention that it's missing two significant items.#1 despite having a sticker on it saying ""Watch with Robert Downey Jr in Maximum Movie Mode"" the single disc version does not have the feature.#2 The single disc version has a flyer for ""Sherlock Holmes 2 Second Screen"" application for the ipad ala the way Disney does it, but once again the disc does not have the feature nor does the app say that it only works with SOME versions.Shame on you Warner Brothers for making a stripped version but not even knowing what it contains in its own packaging!"
2,"Do not be fooled by ""digital copy""","When you see ""ultraviolet"" digital copy you might as well read ""vapor ware."" You don't get a copy for your hard drive, you have to use a complicated server system that has yet to stream successfully for me. If you want a digital copy buy it in HD from iTunes and still get most, of not all, the special features.Plus, they keep a backup on iCloud now.Spend less on a disc only version if you want the disk."
1,UltraViolet is useless,"Beware, the UltraViolet digital copy is a terrible idea. I can't believe movie studios are trending in this direction when the iTunes was was simple and easy. Now I have to download additional computer applications and iPhone/iPad apps just to be able to watch this. Terrible."
1,Desultory Story Interpretation,"This a classic American demonstration of the ability to bastardize any product. This is Sherlock for the ""Monster"" imbibing and AR-15 carrying American who desires to think not and reason less, the central process in the original stories from Doyle. Pathetic and a waste of my money and time! If you have any inkling of the original stories or of the Granada produced video stories you need to avoid this like one attempts to avoid the plague."
2,Not That Good,"This movie is no where near as good as the first one. The plot was not that great and the pace of the movie had me checking my watch to see how much longer I had to suffer to the end. Downey, Jr. and Law are good in their characters as Holmes and Watson and that is about it. If there is to be another Sherlock Holmes sequel, it needs a much improved script or it will be the last episode."
3,Sherlock Holmes: a game of shadows,The movie was fun but not as exciting as I expected. It was easy to follow the story line. I would recommend it.
3,Decent Yet Deceptive,"Lacks the detecting and deliciously Poe-esque tone of Ritchie's first Sherlock. The chemistry, score and wardrobe all remain excellent, despite the movie playing out more as political intrigue than a true mystery."
3,entertaining,"decent movie -- amusing of course but not all that memorable. I found it somewhat difficult to understand the British dialect used by Downey at times. However, I never tire of watching Downey and Co. and their acting abilitites"
3,Not as Good as the First One,"The casting of Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law might seem a strange choice, but all concerns were allayed in the first outing featuring the pair. Of particular novelty were the fight/boxing scenes, which, with slow motion effects were quite thrilling.The second film in the franchise left me cold. As a matter of fact, I had to keep rewinding scenes because I fell asleep. Finally, a day later, I watched the whole thing again, but still I could find little to recommend it, save the chemistry between the two leads.If there is a third, I will give it a chance as I like the overall take on Doyle's masterpiece."
4,Love his disguises!,"Robert Downey, Jr. is very talented in this show--very diverse actor. Some of his disguises crack me up. Him and Jude Law work well together in this show."
4,"Rip-Roaring Entertainment, Great Characterization","Holmes and Watson pursue Moriarty across Europe to prevent him from starting a world war and ending civilization as we know it. This relatively straightforward plot-line provides the pretext for a series of rip-roaring adventures on trains, in deserted factories, at an ambassadors' ball and culminating in a cliff-hanging ending over the Reichenbach Falls. The script is engagingly tongue-in-cheek, with Robert Downey jr's Holmes and Jude Law's Watson forming an ideal partnership: Watson always wants to branch out on his own but finds himself unable to, Jared Harris makes a plausible villain, his smooth vowels contrasting with Holmes' precise, clipped method of delivery. I thoroughly enjoyed this version: not exactly a pastiche but more of an homage to the Conan Doyle books."
2,DISAPOINTED,"NOTHING LIKE THE STORIES I LOVE EFFECTSD ORIGINALLY. ALL SPECIAL EFFECTS HARD TO FOLLOW. the sherlock I remember was so clever ,,which made it interesting."
1,Digital Copy is not what you think,"Don't waste your money on this version. The digital copy cannot be downloaded through iTunes. It is ultraviolet/flixster - in other words, useless/worthless."
3,Disappointing and hard to follow,"I loved the first Sherlock Holmes so i was quite excited when this one was announced. I unfortunately didn't make it to the theaters to see the movie, but rented it using Amazon Video on Demand. I was pretty disappointed. The plot was hard to follow. The entire storyline was not on par with the first movie. They left it open for another one (of course), but I don't think I'll be spending anymore of my time watching these movies."
2,First one was better,"The first Sherlock Holmes was MUCH better than the second. The second one just seemed like too much action and not enough real plot.The download from Amazon worked just fine though, never have issues with that."
2,Never again,"In disbelief that anything could be as bad as the first entry in this series, I gave the second one a look. The casting of Eric Porter in the Brett series was a stroke of inspiration seldom encountered in television or anywhere else. That mountain of crags WAS Moriarty. He has been replaced here by a bearded cherub. But then this is the type of film that cannot be photographed with too much sharpness lest it be taken for a commercial film when heaven knows the director is making an A.R.T. film, the kind they drain of color except for flesh tones. I earnestly hope that they get the lead actor they wanted all along for the following films: Jackie Chan! He would fit right in. Meanwhile, I will be walking through a cow pasture to get away from crackpots and bloated movies like this."
2,Horrible sequel,All I am going to say that this film compared to the first one is like comparing apples and potatoes. Nuff said. Skip it definitely.
5,Shelock Holmes,"This is a wonderful movie, it has the total package, Martin Doweny Jr. is a great actor. I can wait till part 2 comes out. Loved this movie."
1,Great Movie but UltraViolet is horrible and needs to be replaced with an iTunes copy,Another great movie in the Sherlock Holmes series but horrible choice for the Digital Copy. I want to use iTunes which you allowed for the first Sherlock Holmes movie.I will give the movie a better review if you get rid of UltraViolet.
5,Sherlock Holmes: A Bame of Shadows (blu-ray/DVD combo + UltraViolet Digital Copy,Sherlock Holms is and always will be a favorite classic of mine and the two with Robert Downing Jr. with Judd Law and Of course Rachel McAdams are the best I have seen. I hope their will be more to come.Thank you.
2,Not so good,"DId not enjou this movie at all and was hoping it was better than the previous one, the fake accents make it hard to understand what they were saying, don't waste your money"
2,Save your money!,"Not a great movie. Too silly to be a serious Sherlock Holmes mystery. Don't waste your money on either of the two Robert Downey, Jr. versions."
5,a beginning to end thriller,close to a non-stop action movie as well as being a thinking man's movie. Excellently done. Downey's reprise of the original Sherlock Holmes is superb a quick thinking master of deduction and action.be sure to press pause if you leave the room.
4,Good movie,"Its a really good movie, you'll definitely like it if you saw the first one. I definitely recommend it. Screw Flanders."
4,Great Movie,Love the Sherlock Holmes series with Robert Jr and Jude playing the roles. I love the slow motion sequences and the wit used for these movies.
5,"Lots of Fun, Craziness and action","if you saw the first one, you already know how crazy Sherlock is. The fight scenes are incredibly imprbable and this time they don't all happen the way Sherlocks expectations. There are many close calls, as you would expect. It is cleverly done, lots of action, and several scenes/moments made me laugh out loud. I was sitting in a repair shop lounge waiting for me car, I was able to completely lock out all the noise around. it kept me occupied, entertained and helped the time go by. I really have enjoyed it."
4,Good Acting,My family enjoy this movie and have watched it several time already. It is a good addition to our DVD Library.
5,Christmas present,"I still haven't seen this one, that's partially why I bought it for my friend for Christmas, so I can borrow it later, lol."
4,Great 2nd movie,"Hope they make a dozen more of the Sherlock Holmes movies with the same cast. All great actors, and great plots and twists, with plenty of action, and thought.deducted one star for Ultraviolet, I hate this crap who thought it up. It never works for iPods, or iTunes. It also requires signing up to another something I don't need or want to keep up with. Just give me the digital copy I paid for so i can put it in iTunes, money hungry studios."
4,Good Entertainment,I found this movie to be a little quirky but enjoyable. I was looking to be entertained and it surely filled that bill.
4,Excellent sequel,"if you liked the first Guy Ritchie Sherlock, you will like this one too. This film is clever, and funny. I enjoyed watching the actors. But mostly, it was the brilliant film work of Guy Ritchie that does not disappoint. Its classic Ritchie grit and grain. Who did the sets and costumes? Award for that person. Great fun film, only slightly challenging to keep up with the mysterious plot, as Sherlock Holmes story should be."
4,Good series,"This was a good continuation of the original, which I really enjoyed, but a bit confused on where the series might be headed. I eagerly await the next movie, if there is one."
5,Worth the Wait...!,Combining all versions of the masterful sleuth was a brilliant move. It makes for a continued take on Holmes that refreshes the character for the next generation. Buy this movie!
3,Decent action movie; bad Sherlock Holmes movie,"The sequel is considerably worse than the first movie with the character it portrays. Robert Downing Jr was brilliant in the first movie; and he plays Holmes to the best of his ability in this one. However, overall, it is a terrible Holmes story. The story is handed to you in this one. There is no twist, no subversive plot change that Holmes is known for. It follows a straightforward, overused and cliche path of an arms dealer trying to start a World War. That's it. Instead of story substance, the director introduced far to many mindless action scenes. The action had its moments, but Holmes is often reduced to a pure fighter, not the brilliant, cunning detective he actually is. I wouldn't say avoid the movie... It's a good action movie. Just don't expect the brilliance of Holmes."
5,Excellent Movie - Plus my own info on Digital Copies,"I found the movie to be a great continuing of the series. I will agree that it is not as good as the first but I am looking forward to seeing what is next.With regards to the digital copy that someone has commented on does not exist, but I say that is not true. I bought this movie and got the digital copy as well. I have downloaded it not to just my computer but my kindle fire and my droid phone. Not sure why people have trouble with this but I think this is a great feature.I am how ever still testing this to make sure it is easy. It looks like you can download it but need the internet connection to verify it to play it.I will be back with more comments on this."
2,Not entertaining.... Smug ... Uninvolving trite script,"Just going thru their motionsLack of humor , humility , and lacks a story that's interestingTired of the actingTired of a formula movie . This movie goes thru the motions . B. o. R. I. N. g. !"
2,Sherlock Holmes Review,I wasn't too crazy about this movie. It really has a slow start and besides a few comedy parts I thought it was rather boring.
4,Sherlock vs. Moriarty,"A lot of fun watching Robert Downey Jr. and Jared Harris battling wits. If you liked the first one, you will definitely enjoy this one as well."
2,stopped in the middle of movie,"It stopped in the middle of the movie , changed to another DVD and it stoopped in the same place"
3,Ultra Violet Suckage,"Do not stand for this. ULtra Violet is a corporate effort to rip you off. Demand the real deal! Demand a digital copy. Now about the movie - good but not great and that is the problem. These are brilliant actors and with the right material could have made a film for the ages. Play it safe is the maxim for holiday movies. Still, not a bad way to spend a couple of hours."
2,this is the worst movie ive seen in some time,"imo, the movie as hardly any plot, seems pasted together from a series of loosely related scenes and has far too many boring action scenes."
3,Robert misses the mark,"Great potential for real drama and emotion with the death of Sherlock's dear friend and love interest. Never gets there! Robert Downey is too busy impressing himself. In this movie, the actor gets in the way of the character. We want to know more of Holmes- a tall order to be sure, but this movie is more of a mindless romp in the cerebrum of Mr. Downey. Even the relationship of Sherlock with Mr. Watson seems tedious.The good doctor isn't just a straight man for Sherlock to zing with one liners. Reminded me more of Abbot and Costello. One last comment- these are two GREAT actors and the Sherlock Holmes fans (at least me) are crying out, ""Make one more movie and do it right! We believe in you!"". Create something you are really proud of!"
4,new twist on classic Holmes,"These days there seem to be new innovations to the Sherlock Holmes francise. Thankfully, this movie follows a more classic take while being a thoroughly modern adaptation. Well acted, well paced, and well written. All in all, what's not to like?"
5,Great Movie,Great sequel to the first one. I love the pairing of Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. I hope they can make a couple more of these movies or team-up more in the future for other films.
3,Forever!,The movie took forever to establish the full storyline. There was also way too much talking occurring in this one. Liked the first movie much more than this one.
5,Fun Family Film! (teenage family age),"Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are really great to watch. Downey's personality and dry sense of humor makes all of his films shine. Jude Law is a good actor and a great ""stable"" side kick to Sherlock.If you like these two actors you will like the Sherlock series, the Iron Man Series, The Holiday, Only You."
3,"Not as good as the first, but worth a look ...","Disappointing sequel finds Watson getting married but Holmes not letting that stop him from dragging Watson into the investigation of a series of deaths and bombings that threaten to start war. Professor Moriarty, Holmes' greatest foe, is behind it all, and while there are some pretty awesome moments in this film, overall it just feels like it's missing the humanity the first one achieved so well. This one is more about elaborate fight scenes and action sequences and explosions, and at times Holmes here comes off almost more annoying/grating than ever in the first. Not a bad film certainly, but just lackluster compared to its predecessor."
5,Better than the first,"Saw Game of Shadows before the first Sherlock Holmes and loved it. I went back and watched the first one and while it was pretty good, Game of Shadows was much better I thought. I definitely recommend it."
3,"Emphasizes the ""fun"" in ""perfunctory""","Love everything about the movie -- the director, the actors, the characters -- but it does not have much truly exciting about it. Perhaps it's time to give the obnoxious genius shtick a rest."
3,Sherlock Holmes,"Decent action, but the plot was a little thin. Enjoyable to watch, but not worth the $3.99 rental fee. I would recommend this movie if it were cheaper."
1,"Love the Movie, Hate the UltraViolet","The film is excellent, but I find it extraordinarily irritating that UltraViolet continues to be adopted. You get no true digital copy, just a license to log in to their horrible website and stream it--for now. There are no perpetual rights to this license. I want a true, downloadable digital copy that's compatible with iTunes and WMP. Note to Amazon: Stop stocking titles with this horrible UltraViolet service! Fight to keep true, downloadable digital copies!"
1,"Sherlock Holmes, Game of Shadows - One big boring snooze-fest.","Good acting by Downey, Law and others, but terrible direction and storyline. I found it confusing and almost painful to watch the entire film. I'm sorry I did because I would have spent my time better sleeping. Even the 99 cent deal was too much! Free would be too much."
1,Poor direction & story line,"The acting in this movie was rather good, but the direction and the story line were very poor. I sat and watched the whole movie since I paid for it, but I'd really rather get that time back and spend it more wisely."
1,This rating is not for the movie itself.,"This review is instead for the physical product. As of right now I am filing a return for a second defective disc. Upon first playing the disc the previews all work fine, but as soon as the main menu tries to load up the disc stops playback altogether. I have tried all the menu buttons on my player and have only gotten past the error once, but upon trying again after stopping the film I cannot start playback again. Hopefully the publisher will be recalling the defective discs sometime soon but until then I will be getting my money back."
1,Sherlock Holmes game of shadows,Video was defective. I had to stop and restart three times. Video would not let me select scenes to skip defective parts. I had to restart.
3,1st one was better,"Not a bad movie, just not an original movie. If you have seen the first one you pretty much know how this one is going to go. But they do spend the first 15 minutes of this movie wrapping up the end of the original one, so if you have not seen the original one you might be a bit confused for a while."
3,WTF,"Saw the movie,GREAT! Got the disc,Wonderful!....Except.....No extras. Nada,zip! OK,Robert does a visual commentary. But,I think having the extras so one can watch and relish is much better. 3 stars for the disc and the people messing around with them and what works. Oh and the same for the Ultra thing. Pift!"
4,NO MORE ULTRAVIOLET,"If I get another worthless ULTRAVIOLET copy! I love the movie, but was frustrated when I saw it will come with ultraviolet. Every UltraViolet I've had has been an issue, and if I can pay less without it, GREAT. I'll pay for digital copy, but hate paying for UltraViolet! But I still really liked Scherlock Holms 2."
3,Thanks!,"Thanks for the heads up on the the UV. I was just about to order this one. I loved the movie when I went to see it in the theater, but I think I'll pass on this one. Hopefully I can find it in just plain old DVD or Blue Ray. Thanks again!!!!!!"
4,Entertaining,xx xx xxxx xxx xx x xxx xxxx xx xxx xx xx xxx cx x d d. Cxx xxxxx vvv iv xx xxx x xxxx x xxxx xx xx xxxx xx x xxx.
3,Another Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows?,"I liked the movie better on the big screen, but it was okay. Of course Robert Downey Jr was ridiculous as usual an couldn't be beat! I was glad that they left it ""open-ended"" so we can watch out for another one in the future> Sherlock is one of my best characters, whoever plays him.The movie arrive as promised an in excellent condition."
3,Not as Good as the First,"We loved the first Sherlock Holmes and Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law are very good in both. However, in the second film, the script is poor, there are too many jumping ""thought"" sequences by the director and it is short on the twists and surprises in most Sherlock Holmes films or books. It was an ok movie but it was a drop off from the first film. It also seemed more of an early 20th century version of the new James Bond vice the crime solving prowess of Sherlock Holmes. It was average but not because of its main stars who were still very good."
4,Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,"Better than expected for a sequel. Lots of action in a modern update to the old serials. I would have paid money to see this one on the big screen. Like mysteries, and Sherlock, so a natural."
5,Exciting and Fun!,Thrilling and not for the distracted viewer! You really have to sit on the couch and lean-in to this story because it is as complex as it is compelling.
4,Downey as Sherlock Redux,Have yet to actually watch the DVD - but enjoyed the movie in the theater which is why I bought it. My son did not see it theatrically - so I await a nice moment when we can watch together and I can relive the thrills while my son lives it for the first time. Downey and the rest of the cast have an easy chemistry together and Mr. Harris is properly impressive as Dr. Moriarty. this one is a lot of fun.
4,AWESOME MOVIE,"iT WAS ANOTHER GREAT MOVIE, JUST NEEDED A LITTLE MORE ""SHERLOCK"" GOING ON!! tHE FIRST KEPT YOU MORE ON TRACK I THINK, THIS ONE KIND OF LEFT A PERSON GUESSING WHAT WAS COMING NEXT."
3,Ok,"I'm not a fan of Robert Downey Jr, but I purchased this one and the just ""Sherlock Holmes"" together. I watched them both and the videos are good just not for me. I gave them to my daughter."
5,Excelent choise.... good cuality,estoy muy contento de haber elegido comprar estos dvd por un precio bien bajo pero de excente calidad.muy conforme y voy a volver a comprar estas peliculas a bajo precio ....gracias.
5,Spellbinding,My partner and I have watched sections of this movie over and over. Something new is discovered each time. It is truly a fascinating film.
3,Digital Copy Needs the Internet,"I am on vacation and I have the downloaded Ultraviolet copy for this movie on Flixster. (Since I am on vacation, I am typing this on my iPhone).I cannot watch the Ultraviolet copy of ""A Game of Shadows"" on my wi-fi iPad offline.On vacation with no Internet I cannot see my movies on Flixster. So, I can't play them. Very frustrating.The film itself is enjoyable. That's why I wanted to watch it.Edit 1/18/13: I updated the Flixster App (when I was briefly at a place that had wi-fi) and my two movies are now visible in the program. But ""A Game of Shadows"" can't be played because it is ""processing"", meaning it needs a wi-fi connection. So, I won't be seeing the film on this vacation.- And I sent a message to Flixster support about the problem. There has been no helpful response for several hours.* Poor customer service along with poorly designed software.There should have been an iTunes Digital Copy option with this movie."
5,Love!,"Can't wait for #3!! This movie is as good, if not better than the first. Good pairing of actors. Great plot."
3,Too Much Action,"Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad movie, but there was way too much action. I feel there was more time spent showing action sequences than on his ability to use his intellect."
2,Beware Ultraviolet digital copy,"First, please understand that the movie is great! Robert Downey, Jr and Jude Law bring new life into the franchise and their portrayal of this version of the Sherlock Holmes saga makes for some great fun.The problem I have is with the UltraViolet digital copy. It is still a very fussy system and to me not worth the money, time and effort to acquire. I am still not sure what I have and how long I might be able to access it. You can download to UltraViolet - or perhaps Sony - or to Flixster, and watch it on UltraViolet - or maybe Flixster, but if you download to UltraViolet, Flixster might not be able to find it...and each account requires a new setup and password and you must be sure to use the same signin to each account or you will wind up with multiple accounts that can't be merged . . .just not worth it right now. I like the good old download once to iTunes and there it is forever. Very simple and easy to use."
4,Chess Anyone?,"In this second installment, Sherlock Holmes employs a myriad of disguises which even manage to fool Watson on occasion. Watson gets married and Holmes is his best man of course, however, Holmes is a bit of a pest for the new wife. The honeymoon will have to wait. The action and intrigue center around a dangerously clever professor who strives to own all the bullets and bandages in the world. He and Sherlock Holmes play a high stakes game of chess. A winning strategy requires intelligent and unorthodox planning. The conflict and the devices of the villain relate to modern day."
5,great entertainment!,I love this movie. The action is great! The comedy is fall of your seat laughing. Definitely the best Sherlock Holmes!
4,I liked it!,"As always, RDJ is awesome! I wouldn't say it is as good as the last one, but I did really like it."
3,I wish I had realized it was an ULTRAVIOLET download,Ordered this for Father's Day. Hubby loves it. Would have NEVER bought this version ii I realized I couldn't download the film from the disc.Never again will I buy a film with an Ultraviolet download.
4,DECENT ENTERTAINMENT,"LIGHT COMEDY, GOOD SPECIAL EFFECTS. GOES WELL WITH POPCORN--BUT NOT MICROWAVED STUFF--AND EVERYONE ENJOYS IT WITHOUT HAVING TOO LOOK FOR WARDROBE MISHAPS OF SOMEONE REPEATING THE F WORD EVERY 5 SECONDS BECAUSE THEY THINK IT IS COOL."
5,I did love it!,"I watched it twice in the same day, I guess that says it all!And it was nice to see Noomi Rapace, again, I loved her in""The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo,"" all three movies where 5stars. . ."
4,Great Movie,"Great movie. I hope they continue makie the series, as all of them are great combination of drama, action and suspense."
4,Sherlock Holmes A Game of Shadows,Sherlock Holmes A Game of Shadows: I bought it because it's a great movie! Bought the second movie also. I like both of them.
5,Action-Packed !!!,This movie is full of action and truly riveting. Lots of funny dialogues and scenes and love the actors and potrayal of characters. Good directing and cinematography.
5,AWESOME!!!,The first one was great but these films just get better and better. Law and Downey Jr. are such a great team together they were made to play these roles. This film has an awesome plot and action like never before.
5,I do NOT wish to Respond,WHY is there NO OPTION to NOT RESPOND?WHY is there NO OPTION to NOT RESPOND?WHY is there NO OPTION to NOT RESPOND?
3,Okay,I expected more from this movie. Robert Downey is an excellent actor. Howeve there was just something about this movie I didn't care for.
5,What is better than Sherlock Holmes?!,"Not much. Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Lawson have portrayed some interesting characters in a marvelous way! Love Sherlock and love the actors."
3,Robert Downey does it again!,Once again Sherlock proves to be avulnerable human being with extraordinarypowers of observation and ability to anticipatethe worst in others.
4,Good Movie,"I liked this movie much better than the first one. Good story, good twist at the end. And lets face it Robert Downey Jr is hot!"
5,Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,This movie can be summoned up in just a few words :Pure Entertainment and Robert Downey Jr....................... PURE Genus !Nuff said !
4,Robert Downey Jr. Does it Again!,"In this Sherlock Holmes sequel, the legendary detective and his sidekick Watson must work together to bring down Professor Moriarty, an evil genius who always seems to be one step ahead of Holmes. The two travel around Europe and engage the help of a gypsy troupe in their quest for answers.I thoroughly enjoyed Robert Downy Jr. reprising his role as Sherlock Holmes. I was laughing out loud during many of the scenes, and I love the Holmes/Watson bro-mance. I also think many of the action scenes were really well-done. I took away one star from my review just because I felt like the mystery in this movie didn't play out in true Sherlock Holmes-fashion. The focus was clearly on the action, and not so much on putting together clues and solving the puzzle.If you were a fan of the first movie, I would recommend watching this one- it won't disappoint!"
3,Good movie,RDJ and Jude Law acting all smart. Worth seeing. Better than the critics reviews but not as good as the first. Could be a good transition for a third. Richie should get a little more lock stock in there.
4,yes,"this movie is brilliant as far as the sequel to the first it picks up very smoothly after the first sherlock holmes enjoyed the movie as a whole slow start but picks up nicely in the middle leading out to the end masterpiece in my visual windows of 31 yrs i rate thi move a 4.75 out of 5, hers an idea to rub on the brain paypal use it."
1,Schlock!,"I enjoy movies...I enjoy Robert Downey, Jr...but I was extremely disappointed by this movie...starring Robert Downey, Jr. From the start, until the time I finally just turned it off, I was assaulted...or insulted...by what has to be the worst film ever made...terrible acting, goofy slow-motion fight scenes with Sherlock thinking ahead through the whole fight while internally muttering what sound like krav-maga moves named after Mother Goose nursery rhymes... A complete waste of time."
3,Sherlock,"Loved the first movie, but I feel that the second movie fell short. Over all a good movie, just not as good as I anticipated."
3,okay movie continuation of first but fell very short.,"i was very excited to see this one in theaters but after listening to people bad reviews about the movie. It sort of discourage me, but i went anyways to see it. as i said in the title this movie is continuation of the first, but it fell short. i was disappointed; at times it was boring. there is less mystery in the movie. this is okay, because they miss the big opportunity here just rent it on netflix or amazon prime or android play store."
2,Did not like this,Do not recommend. It seemed to be all over the place. Nothing like the Sherlock of old. Poor attempt to modernize.
2,Very poor video quality,The quality of the video was very poor. The movie was very entertaining but we did not enjoy as much due to the poor video quality.
5,DVD given as a gift,"DVD arrived quickly through the mail in time to give as a early Christmas gift.Great movie, full of action and suspense."
5,Another Great Performance,"Unlike some other sequels,this story line really kept us interested in the movie. Robert Downey Jr's personality fit the role perfectly. If you liked him in Iron Man you will love him here."
1,Not a Very Good Movie and I feel Cheated with the Digital Copy,"I guess I should have paid more attention when ordering this....the digital copy is Ultraviolet and doesn't include an iTunes version. If I'd realized that I probably wouldn't have bought it :(The movie isn't that good anyway (the first film was great, this one is kind of boring). As I write this and stare at my disc in discontent I'm wondering why I pre-ordered it..."
1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible",Sherlock Holmes; A Game of Shadows was terrible and completely unbelievable. It was too much like watching a cartoon or worse a video game. There is entirely too much going on and seems like it was made for individuals who have a short attention span. I dread to think what the third installment will be like.
1,RIPP-OFF!,"I'm shocked that this movie was released due to the blatent plagerism committed. This movie was a copy of the film The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Do people have the memory of a gold fish? How do so few people not release if you pay to see this crap you've paid to see the same movie twice. Both movies have the same story, plot, twist, character development, villian, setting and only the comic version of the LOFEG has Sherlock Holmes as the leader of the group. For some reason the studio changed the lead to Quartermain from Sherlock. However, both protaginists have the same fate at the end of both films. Guy Ritchie should've stuck to indie flicks cause he obviously can't hack it in the major league."
1,Coding Error,"Every 20 mts or so there is a judder on the blu ray disc which is clearly a coding/production error. This is probably going to effect a complete batch and is not a ""one off"" so be warned.Loved the film but I thought I should let you know."
1,Terrible,"So the player would try to play it in hd, then continually stop and buffer instead of just lowering the resolution. We couldn't even finish watching the movie."
5,awesome movie,"a sequel worth watching. who would have thought Robert Downey Jr. would be a good detective, but he's at it again, as a quirky Sherlock who knows his stuff."
2,Not my favorite,I didn't get to finish watching! I think amazon should allow the rental to last 24 hours OR until it has played beginning to end.
5,Blu-ray A game of Shadows,Couldn't believe how easy it was to order and pay for this product. I received it in less than 7 days.
3,Good but SLOW,I liked the movie but It felt like the movie took an eternity to watch. It was just a slow moving storyline. Lots of action and suspense.
3,it&#699;s okay,"it was not as great as first movie. it was kind of confusing. i fell asleep the first time i watched it, so i was hoping the second time would be better, but no.."
4,Good price,"This was a gift so I have not personally viewed the movie yet, but the DVD arrived in good shape and within the time range. Overall, it was a good quality purchase with a good price."
4,Great movie,If you saw the first one and liked it you will love this one too. Great action and the actors did a great job
4,A bit jumpy.,"A great film; to be sure. I still feel it went too quickly.Too powerful a villain to be killed off in one movie.The story line seemed to jump from challenge to challenge, without any true development, and then you're at the final showdown when it feels like you're just getting started.I did not get into the special features yet, so they aren't included in this rating."
1,Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,"This is one I paid to download several months ago. It did not completely download and half way through the movie,it quit. The whole movie was never there to see to start with. Is there anyone to complain to about that to be re-imbursed?"
1,Good quality DVD....terrible film,"Having watched the first one of these two versions of SH, and finding the first one absolutely terrible, slow, and mind numbing...all the reviews pointed to this one being far better. Nope....not so. As a matter of fact, this one is worse. The story is all over the place and simply makes no sense. The pace is plodding and just so bad I could not sit through the entire film...made it about 1 hour 15 minutes before I gave up. Even if it got better, I really don't care. The first half was that much of a disaster....why bother? Save your money and go to the library to get this if you must...which is what I did so I don't feel bad about wasting real cash here. The quality was great, sound quality was great and colors just fine....ruined by a terrible script, bad directing and boring story."
1,Movie did not download!,I paid for this item and it did not download!There was no way for me to get my money refunded.
1,ULTRA - HORRIFIC !!!! Great Movie,I think you can guess why I rated the movie 1-star. Sadly I have reached wits end with this scam digital copy garbage cloud. This makes three different movies/three different studios where this ultraviolet digital cloud is a disaster at best. I work in IT and I have never seen such a horrific conglomeration of useless websites with such complexity. I am beginning to think digital copy is a complete scam.
1,worst movie of all time?,"The first movie was kinda passable - but how do you explain this follow-up disaster?Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law should sue their agents, screenwriter and director for this abomination (but Downy also has himself to blame for over-acting and taking the sequel money).A muddled, uninteresting and directorally over-wrought mess of a movie - the over-the-top production budget could have been far better spent against some social cause or philanthropy."
4,Ugh UltraViolet,"Why does every new BluRay have to come with a copy of the movie on DVD and an UltraViolet copy? Neither of these do anything for me! If I have the movie on BluRay, why would I want to watch it on DVD? And since I use Apple products and don't use Flash the UltraViolet copies do absolutely nothing for me.But I did really enjoy this movie. It wasn't quite as good as the first, but Noomi was awesome as always!"
1,Ultra violet is a SCAM!!!,"Ultra violet is not a copy, but access to a copy. NOT the same thing. A true digital copy DOES NOT need the internet. An Ultra-(scam)-violet can't work without without it. This system needs to go away forever."
1,Don't buy with Ultraviolet,"Contrary to most beliefs, ULTRAVIOLET does not constitute having a digital copy. Ultraviolet is merely a copy in an online cloud and only accessible when ULTRAVIOLET deems it prudent to allow access. This is not to be confused with a digitial copy that you can actually have on your portable device or more precisely, your APPLE device. The use of ULTRAVIOLRT does not benefit APPLE Corp, but rather, it hurts APPLE users.Consumers will only be able to change this process with their purchasing power. Refuse to purchase any item claiming to have ULTRAVIOLET DIGITAL COPY and you will soon see it disappear."
1,"No subtitles, no controls - be careful","I like to watch the movies the way I want them. I don't have any problem with Netflix (streaming or otherwise). But the Amazon movies are awful. Never again. Amazon does not tell you what is in their version - there are no subtitles available, which is a staple of all movies.I will never buy a movie from Amazon again."
1,Rating based on media/packaging,"Movie was enjoyable, but the ""digital copy"" is misleading. Give me the option of an iTunes digital copy that I can use on my devices."
1,Ultra Upsetting!!!!,"Unfortunately... I have to add my lumps as well as the majority of other reviewers. The Motion picture industry continues to drive a wedge between themselves and the buyer by instituting things like this. Even digital copy rights are rediculous, due to the fact that you can only download one version to one type of device (either WMV for windows based players, or Quicktime for Apple). This Ultraviolet thing takes it one step further.In my humble opinion... When honest buyers aren't afforded the benefit of having there own personal copy to share between members of the same household, you run the risk of them just going to get it illegally. If you want pirating to stop... stop doing crap like this. The music industry seems to have gotten the point.Remember when they tried to make CDs ""unripable"" by encripting them. All it did was irritate the person buying it, because they couldn't play it on their MP3 device. Really short sited folks. DUMB!!!!"
1,DONE WITH ULTRA VIOLET,"I understand now why it is called that, because it turns you Ultra Violet in anger. I pay extra for these movies and now they are conviently putting Digital Copy on the front instead of UltraV and I freak. This is more trouble than it's worth, why is this even happening. There is probably one person sitting in the fastest internet connection just giggling because he loves these ultra violets because he never goes anywhere like on planes or on the road with his data plan."
3,Single blu ray please,"This isn't really a review , more of a comment . I loved the film at the movies and like almost all the films i love i want a physical copy . Yep , i'm one of those old types . So couldn't care less about the UV blurb and most of the time couldn't give two hoots about a digital copy . I also own a Blu Ray that plays both B.R and DVD , which i bought for the B.R. quality but to be able to play the DVD's i already have and enjoy . So how about having a single Blu Ray copy of this , and so many other films , instead of all the extraneous BS i appear to have to buy as well ?Interestingly , a couple of days after i wrote this , lo and behold it appears on Amazon that a single Blu Ray version will be available on June 12th . Strange that this info isn't released when the multiple and more expensive version is first released ? And you can keep your UV ""copy"" as well ."
1,Ultraviolet is NOT a digital copy! You can't download it to your devices!,"Be warned, ultraviolet ""digital copy"" isn't downloaded to your computer, you have to download it every time to watch. IF their website is up and you have a compatible device. I have NEVER been able to successfully watch an ultraviolet movie. I have a BA in computer information systems, macs, pc desktops, Mac laptop, pc laptop, iPads & iPhones and I've literally never been able to watch one ultraviolet movie due to numerous errors and download failures. I'll buy this movie at iTunes if they won't sell the true ""digital copy"", on a disc that you can install on your computer."
3,S. Holmes_A Game of Shadows,"First, the video and audio are first-rate for this Blu-Ray release (if you watch, as we did, through a surround receiver, you're probably going to have to tone the sound down). All-in-all, the movie is very entertaining; however, being a Sherlock Holmes purist, I could not ""get into"" this release."
1,Couldnt watch it,"The video kept skipping even though audio continued and made it frustrating to watch, so I didn't finish the movie."
3,SHolmes-Game,The movie was not as fresh as the first but still entertaining enough.Robert Downey Jr makes a good and funny Sherlock Holmes.
3,ok,This one just didn't grab my husband or I. Maybe we were just tired that night. We actually turned it off and haven't gotten back to it yet. (The first movie seemed to grab you quicker.)
3,movie rental,I enjoy Sherlock Holmes books and liked the movie but it was a little long. recommended for sherlock holmes fans.
4,Game of Shadows entertains,"I've enjoyed Robert Downey's resurgence in the Sherlock Holmes and Iron Man series. I don't want to watch movies that require me to think, just carry me to a different place. This movie did so."
5,Excellent M,"If you enjoyed the first Sherlock Holmes movie of this series, or just enjoy a witty action movie, then I recommend this movie to you."
3,Over the top,"Sherlock can fend off blows and escape death by knife and gun by visualizing assaults in advance. If I could visualize an anvil dropping on my head before it happened to me, I could avoid catastrophe too. This film is stupid, not to mention being overburdened by Hollywood screenwriting cliches - most excitement and turning points in life happen in bars, on trains, etc."
2,2nd Sherlock Holmes,"He seemed more full of him self and pretentious on a whole new level in this movie. Honestly it was well made, but it just bored me. I didnt even finish it. I did like the first movie though (2010)"
4,The cast makes the movie,Downing Jr. and Law work amazingly well as Sherlock and Watson. These two actors make the movie worth watching. A much better movie than the first.
5,Great Quality,Can't beat the price paid for this. It is only the blue ray DVD< but that is all we watch so it didn't matter.
1,Funny Home Video,This video did not meet my expectations at all. It looked like it was shot with a home video. Sorry - had to return it.
5,17 to 27,"I watched the first two seasons when I was in high school in China. This was the first foreign show that I ever loved to watch. Ten years later I watched this in the US, still warm, funny, sexy, and thrilling.The first season is the best with a lot of subtle but intoxicating chemistry between Lois and Clark. Their characters are best described through their wedding oaths (4th season). Clark Kent is a man with ""gentle grace and quiet strength"", which Dean Cain is naturally gifted to portray. Teri Hatcher has successfully shown the evolution of Lois Lane, from a cutthroat career girl into a loving wife. The supporting characters are very good as well. Luthur, Perry and Jimmy are all memorable.It's a show that I may still enjoy when I am 37."
5,Nothin' like the good ole' days!,"I love Lois and Clark series! It is good natured and clean! Even though it was made in the 90's, I still love it! There are funny episodes and some that are sad. I would definitely purchase this. It is nothing compared to Smallville, but Dean Cain is very good looking! I would recommend to anyone!"
4,Nice DVD set--Film transfer could have been better,"When I first watched the original ABC broadcast of Lois & Clark, I remember thinking how excellent the production values were on the show. It had vivid bright colors, good special effects, great sets and costumes. I bought the DVD set today and see they have done a fine job on the box for presentation. The special effects are, of course, surpassed by today's TV series--but still quite good! Too bad they couldn't get a better film transfer. For example, the Pilot Episode contains a number of white blotches (scratches) every now and then on the film! I'm thinking that even though the show is not too old, and was syndicated, not a lot has been done to take care of it! Great series!"
4,Lois and Clark should be on DVD!,This is one of the best series and it should be on dvd because it tells the best stories about Superman one of the greatest superheroes who ever lived. I love how Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher had great chemistry to make this characters come alive. All the seasons should be on dvd and I hope it is soon. They seem to put out a lot of bad shows instead of the good ones. These should be one of the series that will make to dvd no matter what!
5,We want the DVDs!,"The series are being repeated on UK Gold but the channel is stupid as it plays the episodes out of order. I have seen the first part of many two part episodes but they never show the second part. Its driving me mad! Please publish this onto DVD, I need to know what happens!"
5,Lois and Clark on DVD,"I would love to see all seasons of Lois and Clark be put on DVD. I tape the episodes whenever i'm not able to watch them, but who uses a vcr much anymore? Many people are waiting for this since Louis and Clark attracts both children and adults. It doesn't get much airtime so a DVD would be perfect. It covers all aspects that attracts a person to a show like drama, romance, action,scifi, and comedy. Not to put the episodes on DVD would be crazy."
5,I Agree What Is Taking So Long,"I agree what is taking so long. Why are we putting shows that are still currently out there on DVD but we aren't putting Lois & Clark. I watch it religiously on TNT and I also watched it when it first came out and all seasons after that. They took the Superman story to a whole new level. I loved and who ever puts out these DVD's wouldn't be wasting their money. The show is going to no longer be running on TNT and I need to have it to keep. I would buy all 4 seasons if available. Please, please put this out on DVD as soon as possible."
5,The Best Show Ever,"I have watched this show since i was ten years old. I fell in love with it. I think many people can see part of themselves in different characters and it also shows that communication in very important in any relationship, which all people should know. I really want this released on dvd! I would definitely buy it without any hesitation! This was one of the best shows ever and I can't wait till I own the series! I know many people are waiting for it! Lois and Clark is an amazing show. Even if you didn't watch it you should buy it. It teaches so much and made me beleive very stongly in love. Lois and Clark talks about many different subjects and is humorous yet romantic. It shows just how powerful love can be and how important the people you love really are. I recommend this show to anyone and hope everyone gets to see it sometime in their life. Buy it! It is worth the time and money!"
5,What is keeping the DVD's?,I am a really big fan of Superman.Couple of months ago I started watching Lois and Clark and I love it.The show follows Clark when he first came to Metropolis and as he faced a lot of challenges.There are 88 awesome episodes.This is better than Smallville and other Superman series.I wake up every morning to watch it.I would really want this show on DVD and I am positive I am not the only one.The studio should realease the 4 seasons as soon as possible because a lot of people want it.
5,What??!! Lois & Clark not on DVD??,"I have watched this program and enjoyed it very much ever since it began and I'm surprised that it isn't out on DVD, considering that so many other series are being released on to DVD and haven't even been cancelled...........Wait a minute, ""Smallville"" Season One is out on DVD and that program is going very strong, (and is on my shelf). I have a majority of the episodes on tape if not all of them and it's only a matter of time before they wear out. I pray that the studio that owns the rights to the series releases it on DVD very soon if not yesterday. I enjoyed watching the development of the characters from day one, especially between Lois and Clark. There is a good balance between all of the characters and a good mix of humor and seriousness."
5,GREAT show,I watched this series when it was on t.v. and loved it then... I bought all the series and love it even more now... Lois and Clark has the perfect chemistry plus Dean Cain is a wonderful acter and Teri Hatcher is a great actress. The only thing that disappointed me was on the second season Jimmy was no longer played by Michael Landes. Does any one know what happened? I thought he was a great Jimmy and I missed seeing him. The other thing I didn't like is there were only 4 seasons... too bad they could not have stretched it out to five seasons.
5,Hits the nail on the head,"This DVD set is an excellent buy. The Episodes are detailed on the box with a description of each one. The episodes are 1 hour long each, so it's no surprise that there are only 3-4 on each disc. Each disc has an episode menu, and coupled with the descriptions on the box, it is extremely easy to pick out your favorite episode to watch.This was a great show which was unfortunately and abruptly cancelled (Where'd that baby come from? The future?). The great acting of the cast and chemistry between Dean and Teri holds this show together without the need of introducing any major supervillains.I personally can't wait for the next seasons to come out. Finally, a television series on DVD that is actually worth the money."
4,Entertaining & light-hearted,"It's not Shakespeare, but it's entertaining (more so than many new shows)."
3,ok,"Didn't like the way it was made, i think it is a mockery of the character, some time some chapters are so stupid!!!!!, also the actor is a better clark than a superman, the executive producer is a woman, so most of the idea came from her, so that's explain why the serie is nothing compare to the movie, the comic books, this is a superman of her own imagination... buy i bouhgt it cause i collect superman movies..."
3,AFTER THEY GET MARRIED,ONCE LOIS & CLARK GET MARRIED THE SERIES SUCKS! BUT EVERYTHING UP TO THE POINT OF HIM PURPOSING TO HER IS FUN. THE PSHYC WARD AND LOSS OF HER MEMORY. MY FAVOTE IS WHEN SHE SANG IN A NIGHT CLUB AS WANDA. I LOVED THE BACK IN TIME AND THE FORGETTING HOPE OF CHRISTMAS EPISODE.BUT WONDER WOMAN IS BETTER THAN LOIS AND CLARK
5,A great start...,"Season 1 was a great start to the series. It set up solid foundations for all the characters and really brought you into their world, their problems, and desires. I loved John Shea as Lex Luthor. He comes back briefly in Season 2 and 3 but mainly appears in this first season. He makes a worthy and exciting adversary for Superman. The lightheartedness, growing love story and exceptional chemistry between the actors is what makes this show. I highly recommend purchasing this DVD...then buy season 2 and enjoy watching them take the relationship to the next level."
5,Pure fun!,"Used to put the kids to bed right in the middle of this show (what a cruel mom). They always asked, ""What happened?"" ""Superman saved the day."" So we got them the DVD set for Christmas as a bit of a joke (DS20, DD17, DS15). They LOVE it! It is so much fun to see them get all the nuances and DD is totally into the romance.Good, clean fun and beautifully filmed. Worthwhile commentaries and bonus features. Plenty of good-natured humor on a foundation of ""it's good to be nice"" without being syrupy. A+ to creator Deborah Joy Levine and company!PS- Kids went and bought season 2 the day it came out. Waiting for next seasons. :)"
5,"great tv series, great dvd transfer","I used to watch Lois and Clark on TNT every day. It was a fine addition to the Superman Legacy, and the DVD's definitely do the series justice. If you're a fan of Superman, this series is worth the purchase, especially with the included behind the scenes featurettes. 2 thumbs up."
5,Love It!!!,"This is by far one of the best television series of all time. What makes it the best is the fact that it is the only actual story of superman from start to finish that leaves you feeling complete.It also has the perfect cast not to mention the best lois and clark, their chemistry is amazing!This is a definate classic and a must to own!"
1,Gawd-awful show,"This show takes the character of Superman and puts him in the back seat of his own show. In some episodes, Superman doesn't actually appear until the last five minutes. I think trying to fuse Superman with Moonlighting was such a bad idea. It is painful to watch. Check out Superman the Animated Series or the classic 50s TV series with George Reeves for the best TV versions of the character."
1,Missing huge scene don't buy,This is missing the most important scene in the episode. It goes strait from Lex on top of the world to running from the police.
5,LOIS&CLARK IS AWAY BETTER THAN SMALLVILLE,"LOIS&CLARK; THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN IT REMINDED ME OF ADVENTURES OFSUPERMAN IN THE NEXT GENERATION OF THE 90'S- I LIKE THE IDEA - IT IS WRITTEN&CREATED; BY JERRYSIEGEL&JOESHUSTER.; LOISLANE & CLARKKENT THE BOTH OF THEM ARE WRITERS- REPORTERS AND THEY BOTH WORK FOR THE DAILY PLANET NEWSPAPER IN METROPOLIS, THEY GO OUT AND TO GET STORY IDEAS AS THEY ARE ASKING QUESTIONS TO THE PEOPLE WHEN CLARK HERES ANY SITUATIONS AND OTHER PEOPLE'S PROBLEMS HE TURNS INTO SUPERMAN WHO FIGHTS FOR JUSTICE-TRUTH IN A AMERICAN WAY AND HE SAVES THE DAY - LOIS&CLARK; IS AWAY BETTER THAN CW'SSMALLVILLE IT SHOULD'VE BEEN LIKE THIS SHOW TO ME I'M VERY DISAPOINTED IN TWO SHOWS SMALLVILLE& HEROS NBC T.V. SERIESCHRISBURKE- LIFE GOES ON"
1,One of the worst DC Comics TV shows ever....,"It's amazing that this show was on as long as it was, I never liked it. I thought the acting skills of Teri Hatcher and Dean Cain were non-existent, the stories were even worse. If I thought Superman had been ruined on film because of the Salkinds, that was nothing compared to the trash that was done to him by this show."
2,Not as many insights as I was hoping for,"I purchased this commentary for an in-depth study that I was doing on Wednesday evenings. I carefully checked a bunch of commentaries on Amazon, hoping to find the one that would help me with insights that I could share in the study.Unfortunately, this volume hasn't lived up to my hopes. I didn't need something that would offer the obvious points (I can do that myself). I was hoping for something that would offer insights into some of the more difficult and confusing passages, including thoughts on how those passages apply to our lives today. I've been disappointed. I am now well into the study and rarely even check the book anymore as I'm gathering information.I was between this one and the Carson commentary. Obviously, I think I made the wrong decision. (Not that there's anything theologically wrong in the text - it's just not what I was hoping for.)"
5,incredible,"I found this book incredibly helpful to my personal and academic study of the book of John. This commentary is the most helpful and the most applicable I think I have ever seen. It is so insightful, and allows even a casual reader to delve into the scripture to discover what these words ment to Jesus and how they can be applicable to our lives today. I read John very much differently than I did before readign this book. I give it an A+"
4,Educational,"This particular book is more based on Gree, etc. than from a lecture, preaching standpoint. This author is very deliberate in his delivery of his commentary on John's Gospel. Detailed like a Seminary graduate would more appreciate than the man in the pew who routinely studies the Word who has no Seminary ""education"". Still, anb excellent commjentary."
3,High Hopes Disappointed,"Having benefited from previous volumes in this same series, I was hopeful as I purchased Burge's volume on John. Burge's exegetical notes are helpful, and I have gleaned helpful insights in my sermon prep. But when it comes to the ""contemporary significance"" stage of the commentary, Burge seems more interested in riding his own personal hobby horses and in vindicating some of his own peculiar views. For the student or preacher wanting to find a really solid volume on the gospel of John, I would suggest he/she keep shopping."
5,Highly recommended. A top 10 favorite.,"A spell-binding tale of forbidden love and darkest betrayal set against the lush, sensual backdrop of colonial India. Vivid characters and a compelling plot make this debut novel an outstanding read. ""The Veil of Illusion"" is the sequel to this marvelous book.Remarks from a librarian who specializes in historical fiction."
3,"Phew-- Glad I read it, but glad it's over","After reading such glowing reviews, I tracked down a copy of this book at my library. The story was much different than I expected, but I found the writing style to be very well done. I enjoyed the dialogue and the descriptions were nice but not TOO long. While there is a love story, it is sad and depressing and actually quite stressful at parts. Once I got sucked into the story, the suspense continued to build until I came to a part that so surprised me I actually gasped. I spent the rest of the book fighting the impulse to flip to the last page to find out how it ended because I didn't know if I could handle any more. The ending made up for all the sleep I lost over it, but it is not all rainbows and butterflies for the main characters. This is a story of love, love lost, heartbreak, revenge, and resolution. I'm glad I read it, but this is not a book I would say I enjoyed as a pleasure read."
2,Exotic romance spoiled by inadequate writing style,"Story of mid-19th century India with characters whose speech and actions typify a late 20th century setting. Long-winded descriptions and dialog sound as if they were written by a precocious teenager. Author's knowledge of Indian history, however, appears to be accurate. What could have been an interesting story is spoiled by heavy-handed paperback-romance techniques."
5,David E. Meadows - Outstanding novel,"David E. Meadows has outdone himself with Joint Task Force - Liberia. As a fan of The Sixth Fleet Series, I was eager to read the new series. Joint Task Force - Liberia was worth the wait. It is an outstanding work of Military suspense. The novel weaves a suspenseful tale of modern combat in a world of electronic technology; without ignoring the necessity of ""fighting in the trenches."" The characters are credible and the plot development is outstanding. Bravo Zulu, David. I look forward to your next project."
5,Writing a Family History,"I've been writing a family history for about three years and was pleased that the author validates most of my decisions concerning styles, formats, etc. If I had this book earlier, I could have avoided many of the side trips and lessons learned by ""experience"" along the way. Highly recommended for the genealogist who wants more than names, places and dates."
5,Reliving my family history!,"Being in the middle of writing my history, I now have this excellent book to inspire me to go on. My next step is an advanced writing class that starts this month. The author brings up points that remind me to investigate and also write more detail, or, delete some of the detail.I highly recommend it for ones library.Bev"
2,"fascinating idea, but silly and poorly carried through","Spoilers ahead (no way to discuss this book without giving away the main plot point right away): Amelia Earhart never died, but was captured by Nazis and given an experimental longevity serum later given to Hitler...40 years later, she returns to the past to save the world for the Third Reich rising again. This is a fast-paced, wholly silly mixture of genres (Nazi/SF/romance) that read to me like a mash-up between Clive Cussler and Dean Koontz, with a sprinkling of Richard Matheson's ""Bid Time Return."" It keeps moving, but the characters are cardboard and the resolution unconvincing and unmoving. A good time-waster should you happen across this out-of-print item, but I wouldn't go searching for it unless you're obsessed with Earhart."
3,formatting,"She needs to have what the prayers are actually for so that you can skip around, and pray your convictions on whatever day you choose.Otherwise this was an excellent book."
2,A bit confusing...,"Not what I was looking for. If you are wanting a simple, quick devotional book this is not the one for you. Thought it was actually confusing on how to use the book."
4,Nice Roasting Pan,"This is an aluminum roasting pan so don't think you're getting stainless steel (only the handles are stainless). The pan worked great and is very large - the rack is sturdy. Clean-up with the non stick coating was so easy. After one use there may have been some slight bending in the pan near the handle or perhaps it came that way since the handles are bolted on at that location (I didn't look to closely at first). If you're looking for a large roasting pan, easy to clean, and don't mind it being aluminum than this is a good option. This should work well for years to come."
2,buy the regular cheers,"dont spend 23 more dollars for 2 tracks, if u want them just join itunes and pay 2 dollars extra"
2,Disappointed!,"I was really disappointed when the book I ordered for my wife arrived as it had been represented as used in like new condition, however several pages had been ripped out. I won't buy from this vendor again."
2,short lights,"Unfortunately, these lights don't state an actual length until you receive them. They are only 6ft (lighted length) and not very usable... unless you buy a whole lot of them."
5,A revelation and a gem,"This is probably the best and most stimulating logic text I have ever read---which is saying a great deal. Congratulations to the great Melvin Fitting and his co-author Richard Mendelsohn on producing such a thoroughly excellent text. If you enjoy formal logic and its philosophy, this book is a must-read."
5,A very important book,"I started to learn Logic one year ago and I just finished the reading of this book. It is excellent. It is not an easy reading, like all the texts on Modal Logic. But it is complete, very ingenious in many respects."
3,"Hard to find elsewhere, and ridiculously high priced.","If you have to have it...It's the highest amount of money I've paid for a piece of rubber EVER.But it's very hard to find elsewhere, so..."
1,The description sounds good but it really didn't live up to that.,"Okay you know how you read romance books and they will have a little bit more going on to support the romance. Like some kind of mystery or something. Well this books seems more about the realtionship between the ward, companion and companion's sister than the hero and heroine. While I like the characters and even the H/h of Nikolas as Paige I really didn't think the story focused much on them. Seemed like they were hardly together. Yeah they knew each other before and Paige spent time remembering that but really there wasn't much interaction between the two to warrant a romance. It just didn't feel like a romance novel."
5,DML Forte cream,"DML Forte cream is a terrific cream. It is unscented, not greasy, and very soothing."
2,Not concise enough - too few examples,"This book was a disappointment. I did enjoy the ""resources"" part at the end, however found ""Understanding B2B"" superficial and generalist. It does treat a number of subjects in the area, most of them however too much from a historical perspective, and without ever reaching satisfying substance.The book has few examples and up-to-date information. If you're in a hurry looking to catch-up with the B2B world, if you would like to understand how it works, where it's heading in your industry, I doubt that this work will satisfy you.I recommend E-markets by Dirk Schneider and Gerd Schnetkamp (Gabler Verlag)."
4,a very good book,if you want to have an overview into how exactly data mining is done with a bit of practical flavor and more of the algorithmic inclination this book is for you. But i have been through a better bok so would rate it 4 instead of 5
4,Good introduction on Data Mining,This book is a good introduction on Data Mining with solid explanations of the mathematics behind the methods.
1,Very little content,"This book uses all the buzz words, but has little content. It discuss too many topics and does not go into detail. The writing is very difficult to understand. It is very disappointing especially since the author is well known in the field."
3,Centemporary Cello Compositions,"This is a collection of compositions for cello, for the most part solo (two have piano accompanyment), by 20th century British composers, and that tells you about all you have to know. They are interesting and well-played, but hardly exciting."
2,nothing special,it is poorly stained one side is darker then the other.i am not a big fan but it will do
3,phone stand,"I received the phone stand in a timely manner, however when it arrived it was broken. I did not call about it since I could glue it back together. The quality was not what I expected."
1,Arrived broken,This item arrived broken first of all. The paint seemed like it only had one coat it had spots of natural wood peeking through. It looked cheap compared to picture and compared to another one I have purchased in the past. This looks like a knock off type of item. I sent it back immediately for a refund.
2,Blacked out images,I found blacked out images throughout the book. Can't tell you what should have been there. Astonishingly poor for any published work. Perhaps it was only my copy. The subject matter is highly useful - keeping it above one star.
4,"Decent, but not perfect","This was a decent grater, it grates really well but cleanup could be easier. It seems that cheese still sticks to it and doesn't fall off easily and even though I stick it in the dishwasher, it doesn't come out clean. Could be better, but it's decent."
5,"Clever design, good for our friend Arthur Itis.","The arthritic friend for whom I got this reports that it is easy to use, and it spares her wrist from that lasting pain after opening a jar. I don't thing she is just saying that because it was a gift. I've seen her use it without asking me to help with the jar lid as before, and with very little effort. Thumbs up."
1,Right Show-Wrong Language,Some how managed to grab the Italian version of this vs the English. This was discovered after I pulled the plastic off of it. The region code blocker was my first big hint.
3,To scattered for me...,"I ""get"" the kooky dream-world scenarios. I enjoyed Coraline, but I didn't like Mirrormask. My issue comes with the lack of action. It seems like all the action is so twisted that it makes it unenjoyable. I know this isn't a typical thriller author, but his dream-world action simply got too muddled.He tried to create a fantastical world in my head... but I just couldn't get into it. Maybe it was all the other cars distracting me... I listened to the audio while driving down the highway. Usually, audiobooks make my trips faster. This one, however, did not speed up my drive. -SG"
4,Essential oils certainly were available in Biblical Times,"I have seen numerous slides of essential oil distilleries from ancient Judea, Pakistan and other places in the Near East, which vary significantly from distilleries for alcohol. The distilled oils were floated on water before exiting the drum. Essential oils were certainly available, although it is likely that common folk used infused oils because of their lesser cost. Dr. Stewart has put together some excellent information on the use of oils in Biblical times."
2,Not what I expected,"In my opinion, this book was a little preachy and poorly organized. Don't get me wrong, I agreed with a lot of what the author was saying, but I didn't expect to get that kind of information from this book. I do not feel that the author focused enough on the oils themselves.In agreement with most of the other reviewers that rated this book low, I feel that this book was used as advertisement for Young Living's oils and the Raindrop method. It is not geared for those who are interested in delving into making and mixing their own aromatherapy products or anointing oils.I gave it two stars only because it did give some truthful and interesting tidbits about how the oils work, and popular oils used in the bible."
2,Healing Oils of the Bible,"David Stewart is a convincing writer and I'm sure he's sincere, but the reader should be aware that Mr. Stewart received part of his training from Young Living Essential Oils, which is a multi-level marketing company. Mr. Stewart pushes Young Living oils almost to the exclusion of any other brand and they are quite expensive. He also makes some claims that seem pretty far fetched (see page 80 as an example). As they say, ""If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is."""
3,Informative and interesting,"I liked the book and learned a lot, and the author appears to have done his research and sounds credible. The only negative and disappointing aspect is the fact that he pushes the company he is affiliated with, and I feel he is biased in this regard, especially since any reader acting on his suggestions will provide him with a financial benefit far beyond the purchase of his book. I have been an essential oil consumer for a few years and am familiar with several other oil companies, some of which offer products comparable to the ones he recommends, and at least one other company which has oils which are superior to the ones he recommends, so it was a little frustrating to have to hear about his company's oils over and over again. If and when he updates his book, he should take this into consideration."
4,Good info,I expected this book to be more historical than religious. It is quite Christian. The info in this book is great. I've been using essential oils in my chiropractic practice and this is definately expanding my knowledge.
5,Highly recommended,"David Stewart did a lot of research to write this book. If you work with essential oils, this is a wonderful book to add to your library."
5,Healing Oils of the Bible,"This is a great book. The explanation of the oils, how they are used, and biblically based. It takes us back to God's plan for healing. It also has a Bible study and shows how to present the information to others. For those interested in natural healing, it is a must!"
1,IT WAS SO BAD I RETURNED IT!,"It certainly wasn't what I expected. 25% of the book repeats in several different ways how many times specific oils/plants/herbs are mentioned in the Bible. A large portion of the book is then devoted to pages the reader can use if he/she wishes to give a seminar. Of course, one would have to purchase the oil mixtures in order to give the seminar. BOTTOM LINE: If you want to spend your money on a book that is a thinly veiled ad for a brand of aromatheropy, be my guest."
1,Not Aromatherapy,Beware of writers asscoiated with large multi level marketing companies. It is a shame that this is being passed off as legitimate to people who really don't know the difference. Mixing big business marketing and religion is not easily disquised up by aromatic smoke screens.
4,informative,Great condition of the book along with a speedy delivery. Useful information on the essential oils. Will be a good reference book to use.
1,Riiiiight,"Although Stewart makes an interesting observation about people ""tithing"" to the health care industry through health insurance payments and Medicare taxes--and, sure enough, I added it up and it does come to 13% of my income--this book is baloney. He claims essential oils don't kill people, but doctors and hospitals and drugs kill lots and lots and lots of people. He also says having a mastectomy when you've got breast cancer is an amputation, not a cure, but oils cure people. I hope none of you out there with breast cancer choose to reject medical treatment in favor of essential oils, because not getting medical treatment when they need it DOES kill people.That was just the chapter on ""allopathic"" medicine. The rest of the book is an advertisement for how to give presentations about essential oils, and working threads about essential oils into Bible passages where they aren't really there."
5,fantastic book.a treasure house of information,"An absolute fantastic book. we have lost this great treasure house of medicinal cures for all diseases coz we have stopped believing in GODS gift HE has given to mankind.we live in a busy world and accept that chemically manufactured drugs will cure us but they all have sife effects but GODS oils have no side effects and they cure many dieases at once.this book is a must buy for people who really belive in GODS power to heal us if we allow HIM to work in us through HIS oils.I have read this book many times and still go to it for reference. I use oils and can say 100% that it works.myrrh and frankinsence along with lavender in almond or olive oil is what I use for my face and neck and I haven't suffered from pimples,wrinkles or dry skin for a year now...so GODS oils are the way to go.this is a must buy book."
5,von weber one of the best &unknown,carl von weber is one of the best german composers that ever lived he is as good as mozart or bach but this composer has fallen into obscurity and i do not know why the symphonies 1&2 are powerful and intricate and when you listen to them they bring joy and passion to mind if you are searching for wonderful german classical music order this disc now!!
5,Useful and beautiful,"I'm a clock fan, so I can tell you this clock will help you in your work, at the gym, in your trip, so it is a good purchase"
2,does NOT hold ID,"Although the description says ""Ideal for carrying money, keys, and I.D."" you cannot put your ID there. So it is only good for taking your cash and keys with your, but not ID (or credit card)."
1,incorrect pictures,The pictures looked like exactly what I wanted but they're not pictures of the product I received. The pictures indicate a rectangular pocket while the one I received was more triangular which prevents anything rectangular from fitting in the pocket. A credit card or ID card fits about halfway and prevents the pocket from closing. It would be good for keeping a couple of keys and cash but no cards.
3,This thing better work,"I had one of these things, I bought it at a luggage store and never used it so I gave it away. Then along comes Nike and Ipod and now I need it - b/c I do not like Nike running shoes. I must have wasted a tank full of gas driving all over the place trying to find one of these, and YES, IF Wal-Mart, or Target, or the Dollar Store, or a gazzilion other places I looked did sell it, it would not cost so much - but after gouging out a hole in my Saucony's and almost slicing my finger off - this has got to be a better option. Boy I hope so. . . ."
1,How Can I Review A Product I Never Received!,"Amazon sent me an email asking me to review this product. Interesting, since I never received it and was told that I never would!"
5,Detailed,If you're looking for a wealth of information with every detail listed then this is an excellent choice. The book is perhaps better used in the way of an encyclopedia: read up on a particular item that interests you; reading the book front to back is a bit tough as the text doesn't flow well and there's too much information to keep it all in mind.Some great primary texts areThe Life of Apollonius of TyanaandThe Syrian Goddess: De Dea Syria.
5,love these,These are great. Use for both my inbox and filing tray. It is very good quality and durable. I would recommend this to anyone.
2,Incredibly Long Charge Time,"I purchased this item as a means to charge my Palm while on the road. The old Palm V charger worked wonderfully for this, but unfortunately the Mobility Kit doesn't. The kit consists of a nifty car adapter to USB power converter and a four foot (1.5m) USB Type A to Mini-B cable. Neither the car adapter nor the USB cable connected to a PC provides enough power to charge the Palm appreciably over the length of a normal commute. (under 60 minutes)The only reason this doesn't get one star is the USB cable remains useful, albeit quite pricey compared to the equivalent product elsewhere."
4,Garmin AC Charger,"AC Charger works well and allows ability to program Garmin while at home as well as charge the battery; howeber, it is probably an unnecessary purchase for tyhe average user."
3,You don't need it,"I don't know why you would need this. We ordered it and only used it one time. After figuring out how to use our Garmin we discovered that our model does not hold a charge, thus we cannot carry it around and use it. To use it as a GPS, it has to be in a car and plugged into the outlet there. You wouldn't really have a need to have your GPS plugged in at your home, because it isn't moving and cannot function."
1,not compatable with C 530,"Needed a home charger, thought this would work. If you are looking for a charger for the Streetpilot 530, DO NOT get this one, it is not compatable. Thank you, Amazon, for making the return hassel free."
1,Not really needed,"The built in charger with the Garmin, connecting to the cigarette lighter, is really all you need. Perhaps if you travel a lot without your car, and need your Garmin fully charged right away for use in another vehicle, this might be useful. But I find I do not use the separate charger."
1,It isn't for the C550 (auto) unit,"I tried twice to get a AC charger for my C550 auto unit. It was a NO GO. What you receive is not what you need, and fits the C series for the 300 and Zumo 500 series (motorcycle). It's a glich in product numbers. Soooooo, if you want a AC charger for your Auto/unit (C550) you should order from Garmin. Believe me, I'm saving you some hassle, and time. And, to Amazon, it's a small matter you should correct. Thanks..."
4,Garmin Streetpilot A/C charger,The charger makes recharging your streetpilot easy. Just remember to turn the streetpilot off before recharging.
3,Had I known.,"Product works as advertised. Had I known that the charger is identical to those that are used to charge a number of cellphones, which I happen to have, I would not have purchased it."
1,Use a Cell Phone Charger!,I was about to purchase this and read the comment about someone using their phone charger so I tried my phone charger and it worked perfect. I have a Motorola Slvr and it works just fine. I'm glad I didn't waste my money.
3,OK for the money; But Maps are Old,"Purchased the StreetPilot 330c Series starting at around $299.95Touch screen works OK in locations I know about. I love Mrs. Garmin's voice. The maps are old so when we took a trip to Wisconsin this summer and there was new freeway (about 2 years old), it did not know what to do. Same for handeling the 35W bridge problem in MN. I have missed turns on purpose to see Mrs. Garmins reaction. I love the way she recalculates and sets me straight. Even knows some of the back road shortcuts once you get one them. Since I have a Mac and there is no DVD disc for Mac Users and no directions, I am not completely satisfied. I am looking for a way to get new maps. Anyone out there got the solution? Overall a very good purchase for around $300."
1,Garmin sells 3 AC chargers. This is for StreetPilot c3xx.,"010-10618-00 for StreetPilot c310 c320 c330 c340.010-10747-04 for StreetPilot c510 c530 c550 c580.010-10723-00 for StreetPilot i2/3/5 and all Nuvi.GPS may charge via USB. It's slower, but save $! :-Deal"
1,A/C Charger incompatible connection,"I am writing this response on 7/31/2007. On 7/12/2007, these 2 Garmin A/C Chargers for my C340 purchased on 6/19/2007 were returned because the connection was not compatible. The connection on the A/C charger sent to me is rectangular and my Garmin C340 is round. Assuming that there is no Garmin A/C charger with a round connection, I returned them and requested a refund to my credit card. Please advise the status since it has been about 3 weeks. Thank you."
3,FILA INFANT SHOWS,The fila infant show are nice but with some kids they have chubby feet or wide feet so I think in this style of shoe they need a wide shoe size.
5,A book to remember,"I read Sunrise Song several years ago and have never been able to forget it. It is a beautifully written book which seriously confronts important and painful issues between whites and Native Americans. Eagle accomplishes this through a wrenching interplay between present and past action. Since my own family was living on the frontier at the time of the past action, I was forced to do some weighty soul searching about the role of my own ancestors.The Chicago interview should not be taken seriously. The criticisms are shallow and the text is illiterate."
1,DEPRESSING READ,"This is a bizzare and depressing book filled with one dimensional characters and plot holes you can drive a semi through. Of the occasional books of her's that I have bought new, I've generally taken them back to the bookstore for a cash refund. What I couldn't get a refund on, I've taken them to my local UBS and traded them for something more worthwhile. I just don't buy Eagle anymore.I'm surprised she's still published."
3,Diverse tastes but basic nutrition info has been left out.,"I was intrigued by the variety and really wanted to try some of the recipes but without even basic nutrition info I was unable to purchase it.With so many diverse diets of friends today (low fat, low carbohydrate, salt free, sugar free/diabetic, etc.) a cookbook without nutrition info for each recipe is a waste, no wonder it is out of print."
4,A good introduction,"Overall, I should say I am fairly impressed. I do not know the Mahabharata enough to say whether the translation preserves the spirit of it, but as a piece of writing it is highly satisfying. It made me want to learn more about Indian literature. Buck has written a tale accessible to us westerners who have never heard of Arjuna or the like, with characters that we can identify with. That said, the brevity of it sometimes makes some episodes impossible to understand, unless, I suppose, one has external knowledge about the epic. Some references within the text I understood only after reading a bit more about India, but on the whole it does not hamper the overall comprehension of the epic. A fine read. I would have appreciated a more detailed directory of characters and gods (especially the latter) so one could see what Buck is talking about."
1,There are better versions,"I am not any kind of sanskrit scholar but I have enjoyed reading mythological literature for about ten years and I found Buck's Mahabharata to be a bore. I found it incomprehensible and disjointed. It was as if the author was trying really hard to create such an air of enchantment that he gave us something that sounded downright obscure and pretentious. At first I thought that maybe the original is this way, but then I came across R.K.Narayan's crystal clear version. After that I read Rajagopalachari's, which was beautiful. I recommend these versions much more."
2,What?,I have read a lot of spiritual books in the past few years and I thought this would add to the list but what suprise!I am close to 100 pages into the book and very disappointed to say I see nothing spiritual about it.Maybe its just me or maybe its taking a huge book and condensing it to a few hundred pages but I just dont get it?
1,Not the best version of Mahabharata to read,"I would strongly recommend you to get ""The Mahabharata"" retold by C.Rajagopalachari. This is the best version of the Mahabhatata you can ever read!!! Please do not buy the version by William buck..."
1,Confused narrative,"I have today finished reading William Buck's retelling of the Mahabharata and am disappointed. English-language readers might be better advised to read Rajagopalachari version to get an overview of the epic.I should like to mention that I have Indian antecedents and have read various abridged translations of the Mahabharata in both English and Gujarati.This rendition is riddled with careless editing of the narrative. For example, the entire episode of the Aswamedha is omitted from the narrative yet Buck refers to Yudhisthira as ""King of Kings"".Besides removing important events and characters Buck displays a lack of understanding of dharma. An example will suffice: Buck has Arjuna marry Uttara, the daughter of Virata at the end of the 13-year exile -- since Arjun had been her teacher this act would be adharma. (Arjun's son Abhimanyu marries Uttara in Vyasa's Mahabharata.)Overall I cannot recommend this version."
4,Great summary and introduction for casual readers,"This book is great for those readers who want to learn the story of the Mahabharata. Buck's retelling of the ancient Indian story is very easy to read, and he has ironed out some of the hurdles that distract Western readers. His retelling is not strictly true to the original, so experts beware. This book is rendered so smoothly in English that it can be read without any background knowledge, unlike Rajagopalachari's version. It is also more concise than K. Subramanian's version. For more precise translations, see Ganguli or van Buitenen."
4,An Emphasis On Morality!,"In this adaptation of the classic, William Buck retells the >3400 year old Sanskrit epic verse, the ""Mahabharata.""This text provides detailed interaction between the figures engaged in the Bharata war that took place between the Kurus people and the Pandus or Pandavas people. The actions of the warriors of both peoples are portrayed in both a heroic and moral context, and it should be understood that the Mahabharata is a reenactment (allegorical) of a cosmic moral confrontation (by the gods), and not simply an account of the cataclysmic battle.Buck's version of the original is written in a smooth flowing and interesting way and is a good introduction to Dharma, Indian mythology, Hinduism, and the caste system. I rate Buck's version at four stars for an attempt at a flowing novel, but being a little ""disjointed,"" and lacking somewhat in detail. All in all, well done."
5,Good Book,"I bought this book and didn't actually get around to reading it until a couple months later. At the time I was mostly knitting socks, and tried her color pattern knitting ideas on some socks, with good results. Now that I am knitting a sweater, I can really see the usefulness of this book. This book has helped me understand much more of what I am doing. I would expect that anyone would find something of use in this little book. I also have several of Elizabeth Zimmerman's books, this book is a nice addition for anyone wanting to knit without blindly following patterns, and understanding what is going on in their knitting.I enjoy this book,every time I re read it I learn something new, or get more ideas."
1,Drop the religion,"The biblical and creator references in this book are overwhelming. I thought I was buying a book about knitting, but found the references too distracting to be able to focus on her knitting instructions."
3,?,"Maybe people should talk to people who lived under Mussolini, before giving there opinion on him. My family lived under Mussolini for several years and said he was a great leader and did more for the people then the leaders do today. Don't let the media distort the truth, like it usually does"
1,Politically correct biography,"It's an old biography that I already have seen in a tape. It is made by somebody that does not know Mussolini and the history of Italy. Mussolini made basically only one big mistake that eventually distroyed Italy and him: the one to enter into WW2.Until the declaration of war in June 1940,95% of Italians would have voted for IL DUCE if there had been free elections.Mussolini was not one of the most ruthless dictator. On the contrary his dictatorship was very, very mild. And he had a lot of humanity. Nothing to compare with Hitler or even worse with Stalin. The film shows only the bad aspects of Mussolini, but does not show the many achievements Mussolini did during his time. It's interesting to read the very positive comments some political people did about Mussolini before the WW2: particularly Winston Churchill and Austen Chamberlin."
4,813,"This documentary is not to bad, it could have been better. A&E; goes and states in the documentary that Mussolini was wounded fighting in the Alps of Italy, wounded by a grenade that went off near him, and in another instance they go and say Mussolini was a coward and never seen any action (duh).At the end of the documentary they have an interview with Mussolini's grand daughter, she is definitely worth watching. You also see fascism is still alive today in Italy. A&E; also shows Mussolini in Ethiopia, footage of his death, some speeches, the blackshirts, and other things.This documentary could have been more pro Mussolini but with a title like ""Mussolini, Italy's Nightmare"" what do you expect. In my personal opinion Mussolini was one of the best things that ever happened in Italy."
1,Same ol' story,"This documentary is about ALL the wrong things Mussolini did, and NOTHING about the good things. Better to read a history book."
1,"A review from Italy, mothercountry of Mussolini - Dux","It's incredible the way some people write and talk about things they merely know, or they don't know at all. It's natural that an english version of this video sells more copies in the anglo-saxon world if it is negative about Mussolini... I'd like to recommend a ""super-partes"" view on historical events: but not everybody can or want to do it ... Anybody study the REAL history, make his OWN considerations: then see this movie!"
3,He *was* a nightmare,"Mussolini *was* a disaster for Italy and the Italian people. This negative bio is largely correct. Mussolini brought ruin to his people through arrogance, narcissism, and opportunism."
1,Not at all what I expected,"I bought this in small, black, to put in my dogs' crates. It was furry and soft, but with practically no stuffing - it was like someone sewed two pieces of fabric together. They would have had a softer bed if I had folded a towel up instead."
5,opinion,This product works well for my dogs. It is durable and easy to wash when soiled. I recommend it.
5,cozy cozy,"arrived quickly and is just a great bed, our 4 month old maltipoo just loves it for taking his naps. he has another bed but i think he gets a little overheated on it, so he prefers this Precision Snozzy Bed. it also washed very well. very glad i purchased it. good quality."
1,"Little mat, big mistake","This pet bed is sold as 23 x 16 inches and the appropriate size for a 24 x 18 dog crate. It totally isn't! It measures barely 21 by 15 inches. That's not going to cut it in my dog's crate. Other than misrepresenting the size however, it is a nice little (very, very little) crate mat. Will definitely be returned. If you want to receive the actual size bed you ordered, this one is a pass."
4,Good for my large 100 lb dog,"I have a large black lab who loves this bed. We've had it for several months and in his 8 years, I think it's probably his favorite bed so far. Mine too. I've tried many kinds and this one is great because it hides his black hair, is soft, durable and washable...sort of. It claims to be washable and while it is, it recommends a front load, commerical washer which I don't have. I washed it in our regular washer and it did fine. It came out a little lumpy but my dog doesn't seem to notice and it still looks nice. Also, we have it on our hardwood floor and it seems to be enough padding for him. But then he also likes to lay on the tile when he's hot."
2,Not the right size to fit wire crates,"i ordered this bed to go in my dogs 48"" wire metal crate (typical type) and it DOES state that the product is several inches smaller than crate but i assumed that this was just over-kill so people would know what it fit INSIDE the crate and wouldnt to way too large. i have a ""quiet time"" crate pad in there already and this bed FITS INSIDE my current bed, if that gives you any idea. i am going to keep this item since it is small enough to fit inside the other crate mat it kind of evens out the size difference but am disappointed that this can not be used solely to fit inside a typical crate, it will leave about 3 inches length and 3 inches width of nothingness on the sides."
2,Backwards Quality,"This is the 4th purchase of this product I have made over the last 3 years. I usually by 2 and rotate but I'm glad I didn't this time. It appears the company has taken a step backward in quality. On the other 3 they were thick, plush, well made, and stand a lot of washing before degradation. This one is nearly the same visibly and is plush but I would say has about 30% less filler and is less robust. The price is about the same. Looks like I'll have to buy the more expensive products to get quality. The others lasted about 18 months. I doubt this will make 6."
4,Comfy Bed,The only reason I did not go 5 stars was because after washing it you have to spend some time spreading the stuffing around to have it lay flat again. Otherwise dogs love it and they don`t try to chew it.
5,"Easy, inexpensive way to keep up on your health","I was told by my doctor to keep track of my blood pressure. Being a gadget guy I wanted it to also report to my computer. However, I am trying to be goof with money and only spend cash so I was a little restricted witht he money. This little unit stroes so much data that I can just carry it in to the doc and she can read it. The fact that it allows you to test at the forearm and not the bicept makes testing yopurself a lot easier."
2,Not reliable!,"Terrible, these instruments are not reliable, I would definitely recommend not to use a wrist meter, but meter arm monitor."
1,Oregon Scientific Talking Blood Pressure Monitor,"Received the wrist monitor and took it with me to Doc. office to check W/ their Blood Pressure Cuff. It read so low compared to their Blood Pressure Cuff,if it had been for real,it was a good thing I was in a Hospital,just down the hall from E.R."
4,I like it,I don't know how accurate this thing is but it is very easy to use. I always take my pressure twice and find it comes up 98% of the time with a same reading as the first. Just make sure you get it tight enough on your wrist. I would buy this item again.
5,Blood pressure wrist cuff,The pressure cuff works very well and is accurate in readings with my local medical clinic equipment. I would recomend it to anyone.
1,item not turning on to start.,the item is not working. it would not turn on.the batteries started to over heat.i really want a refund or place item.please.i really wanted this item for my aged mother who can't see .
4,"Forget the misleading ""Beat"" title...but it's good!","Definitely don't buy this if you're looking for lots of info or an extensive essay on the ""beat"" generation, etc. The awesome Alan Watts does deal with that topic, but almost in passing. He's goes into more detail explaining Zen and Hindu ideas with a huge helping of humor. Some ideas will stay with you. His emphasis on the key concepts of living the moment and a job as an avocation (not just to spend x number of hours making money but to do for the JOY of it)forever will be imprinted in your mind, as well as various clever examples he sites. Especially memorable is his explanation of how we Americans often live too much in the past and future and don't appreciate the present. He likened it to a coin: one side is the future, the other the past -- but the REAL stuff is the metal in between (the present). A small book with lots of big ideas that are cleverly presented."
1,Problem HD DVD,"I have been looking forward to this HD DVD for months. I have seen numerous stage productions of ""Die Fledermaus"" and a few on TV as well, and I love this opera. Unfortunately, I have had the same experience with this as ""deepdiver"" posted earlier. I have an A3 with up-to-date firmware. It wouldn't play. I then took it to a dealer, and we tried to play it on their A3, A30, and A35 (all with up-to-date firmware). We consistently got the error message which declared the disc unreadable: 408bc00d. Regretfully, I must return it to Amazon. I hope they straighten this problem out for those of us without an XBox 360 with add-on HD DVD player. I REALLY want to see this! I wish I didn't have to give it one star to alert buyers. One reviewer was able to watch it and loved it. I hope to have that experience one day."
4,Glorious production,"This is the first blue-ray version of an operetta that lends itself to detailed stagecraft. It doesn't disappoint on that score. All of the performances are first rate, notably those of Adele and the Prince. Set decoration uses bright flashes of costume colour against a muted background suggestive of Vienna between the Wars. The second act lacks the sparkle we often expect at a live performance, with none of the 'guest appearances' that we often expect, and none of the ensemble dance numbers. The dialogue has been modernized in a way I found appealing [contrary to another review], a long-standing tradition and not at all inappropriate for an audience that (let's face it) that's out late at night on New Year's Eve and likely drinking during the interval. Frosch unfortunately doesn't get to make a topical standup routine."
4,Enjoyable...but...,"The video and audio quality of this Blu-ray DVD is outstanding. While there are other recorded performances with ""bigger name"" artists, none of the singers in this DVD need apologize. It is a fine production, musically. However, in an attempt to emphasize the sarcasm, portions of the libretto were re-written with very obvious sexual innuendos. This simply was not necessary. Strauss wrote a masterpiece and Die Fledermaus doesn't need any help."
1,"Bad experience, wasted time.","I really wanted to see this one on high definition(yes, it is shown as widescreen on the back cover) but it looks that the disk manufacturer was not been ready for this release.I am sending the second disk back to Amazon for the same reason: error 408bc00d. I have a Toshiba D3 and an A35 both upgraded to the latest firmaware revisions and both showing the same error on two disks now. All the other hd-dvd I have are working fine so I decided to return the disk for full refund.Amazon service was very good, the cast may be very good also, the lonely star goes to the disk manufacturer"
3,Curious cinematic contribution,"Any film that is a sequel that has Angelique Pettijohn replacing Beverly Hills has to be watched to be believed. There was a series of this Phillipine-shot flicks at the time and I remembered seeing a lot of them on old WVIA-44 in Scranton with some old guy hosting ala Zacherley. These were spooky and moody with some great locales and some gory effects but, really, they had marginal acting and some terrible scripts. They were kitchsy and cool when we were kids and if you look at the Blood Island films from the eye in the corner of you memory, you'll really enjoy them. I think Mad Doctor was the best of the bunch."
5,Zoom-Zoom,"Hey! Don't knock the camera Zoom-Zooming in and out. The effect was not far different but way ahead of the ""Blair Witch"" shaky camera technique. Haven't seen a re-issue yet, but this was always one of my favorite late night creature features."
4,Island Gals Gone Wild!...,"John Ashley returns (as a pathologist!) in this gooshy, bubbly, cheezelog sequel to BRIDES OF BLOOD! This time, Ashley is joined by the lovely Angelique Pettyjohn as a woman in search of her father. Meanwhile, a moss-covered zombie is mutilating the island folk! Unlike BRIDES, MAD DOCTOR has actual gore sequences, including bloody limbs and intestines! The murdering monster isn't bad at all, especially for a low-low budget drive-in classic. Of course, as the gore rises, so does the nudity! Yes, there are some beautiful island babes in this one! Eddie Romero has once again fashioned a very enjoyable hunk of exploitation horror cinema! See the entire trilogy..."
4,As bill sees it,"This is a terrific daily reader. It is full of selected readings from the book, the grapevine meeting in print publication and letters from Bill Wilson."
5,Magical,Beautiful and brings back such great memories of my youth. It is constructed of durable fabric which will outlast any young girl who gets to enjoy this. I would almost predict it would produce magical dreams.
4,Very useful...,This is a very useful book especially for those foreign engineers. There are terms in the book which most likely you have not encountered at school that might come in handy.
1,Waste of money,"Product came with missing pieces (box where screws should have been was empty). Product broke seconds into attempt to assemble (cheap material). Assembly instruction are the least helpful I've seen, suggest that company doesn't care about its product and certainly its customers. Product is a sham."
1,Save your money,The cartridge must be removed once a day and wiped with a moist paper towel to remove the dry ink.Save your money.
3,Streaky/dry after short use,"After a short time of using this product (less than 100 pages for sure), the text I was printing started becoming streaky/faint, as if the cartridge was running out.You get what you pay for here."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"I should have known better, and now I do, at least when it comes to ordering this ink cartridge. I popped it in to my printer, and the print was almost non-existent. I even cleaned and primed, and it still wouldn't work. The reason I gave it one star is it arrived quickly in the mail. Too bad it didn't work, that's all."
1,Hp Desk jet Ink cartridge,I bought a desk jet ink 3520 ink cartridge 27 black from E-z ink inc but it dose not work . when I received it and i tried to print out but it does not work at all.
2,not pleased!,I received the wrong color ink and when customer service called me about the problem she said she will send me the one i ordered. I haven't received any email back and did not get the black ink i wanted. she said it was free of charge. Still haven't heard or seen anything yet.
1,Doesn't work,"This would have been a great deal had the product not been defective. When I put the cartridge in my printer, all it says is cartridge error. I've went through all the trouble shooting suggestions and it still doesn't work."
2,Not sold on these.,"I bought three of these. The first one never really worked right. It printed really light and text was blotchy. Cleaning the head with an alcohol swab seemed to help, but I had to do that several times. The second cartridge has worked completely perfectly.Update 10/27/2009:Cartridges work just OK, not great. I would not buy again. You have to clean the head with alcohol regularly to get them to work. And the 3rd cartridge I'm on now refuses to print any shade of gray, will only print black. I would not buy again."
1,Worst spent money on ink ever,"I bought two of these ink cartridges. The first one left smudges on every paper so I threw it away. The second one was practically EMPTY. Are you serious? After the 5th page, the cartridge ran out of ink. It would only print a few lines of distorted text and quit. FMLI do not recommend these re-manufactured ink cartridges. Its a complete waste of money. I knew I should have spent the extra money on HP's OEM ink./End Rage"
3,i felt,I am glad that I bought this when I did because it is such a good deal....however the ink does not last as long
2,The most frustrating vacuum I have ever owned!,"My husband bought this for me for Christmas, and while it seems to suck up the dirt and dog hair, it doesn't seem like it has as much suction power as my old Hoover.....especially when using the extension hose. The worst part though is that the belt keeps coming off! I will be vacuuming and then randomly the brush stops turning and I have to stop and take the bottom apart, take out the brush and reattach the belt. The other day it happened 5-6 times while vacuuming my house. What a pain. I really feel like it is not remotely worth the money, and I am going back to Hoover vacuums."
2,"Worked, but not for as long as I wanted...","Bought it about five to six months ago. Worked for fine for that amount of time. Now it doesn't work. It makes a strange noise, and makes a VERY bad smell. Don't know much about vaccums so I don't know what the problem is, but I expected a vaccum that costs this much to last much longer..."
1,This is as trashy as what its expected to pick up from the floor,"I can't believe what a useless waste of space this ""vacuum cleaner"" is. I've had it less than a year. On the 2nd use, the first belt broke. It goes through belts like my 3 year old goes through clothes. The hose won't consistently stay clamped to the handle, falling into your knees as you try to push the thing. I can't get through a single job without it clogging and respreading the dirt everywhere as I try to unclog it. Its a 3-4 step process if it clogs further inside the filter sending me into a full-blown asthma attack (and my asthma is pretty mild). Its going to the curb on the next trash pick-up because now the clamp that holds it locked upright is now broken and I don't even know how that managed to happen. I guess at about $90 you get what you pay for. Those Dyson's better be worth the $[...] because I'm getting one tomorrow."
1,Do a test run,I bought this machine and a Dyson the same day. This one I bought for our lower level family room. After assembly I found it was very hard to operate and heavy!I now see why they store models are put so high up out of the consumers reach. The upolstry tool is worthless. I find the dust and debis collects around the filter until the machine will absolutely clog up and stop. the Dyson? Worth every penny and I should have bought 2.
2,Belt broke,"Belt broke within 3 uses and the hand attachment keeps getting knocked out of the holder. So no, I don't like this one very much. Now I have to go find a replacement belt."
1,Buy it if you don't mind the dust shooting out,"The vacuum cleaner worked excellent for first two months after I bought it online. Later one day after vacuuming a room, I noticed some very fine dust on the base cover of the machine. I wiped it clean and vacuumed another room and the dust was there again. The rubber cover over the brush roller has a gap and the dust was coming out of it. I put a sticky tape covering the gap in the hope of blocking the dust. It did cut down on the amount of dust, but the it is still coming out from several different places and I cann't cover all of them. I am planning to return the item."
3,heavy,"very heavy, on switch located on the side, handle is not comfortable,lots of suction but very clumsy."
5,I can't imagine a Dyson being much better,"We have had a housekeeper for the past year. Recently, we decided to cut expenses and she was the first to go. We researched vacuums and settled on this one due to price and reviews. The first room we vacuumed filled up the container with dirt and pet hair. I can't believe the filth we were living in! When I finished the house, I had enough pet hair to make another dog! I really can't see how a Dyson would be much better. This is a great machine. It is quiet and rolls effortlessly. The attachments are great too. Save your money and get one of these."
1,Belt slips off too often,"I thought maybe it was just me, but now that I read the other reviews I see there's a general problem with this vacuum. The belt tends to slip off fairly often. The last time it happened on my vacuum, it began rubbing on the plastic housing that surrounds the belt. It got hot enough to melt the plastic in several places to the point that the vacuum is beyond repair. I'm going to see if the store will let me return it so I can buy a different brand."
4,Awesome Vacuum!!,"I had no idea so much dirt and filth was trapped beneath my carpets. This vacuum is amazing. I swear my carpets even _feel_ different after I vacuum. I could not ask for a more powerful (yet fairly lightweight) machine for the money. My only negative is that emptying the canister is pretty gross, and you will get dirt on your hands and all over the bottom part of the vacuum. I knew this going into it thought. I usually have to wipe the machine down after each use. I don't mind though, considering how will it cleans."
3,Good Vacumm - Attachment Hose is too short,"Great vacuum, but the hose is way too short for using the attachments. I am constantly pulling the machine over because of this."
4,Good product. Good price,"I like my vacuum cleaner a lot. It serves the vacuuming needs of my 1BR apartment very well - both the hardwood floors and the carpet. I like the attachments and the red light for dirty, green for clean system. I also like the bagless feature, it is so easy to empty! Good suction and good attachments. If I had a more complicated place with stairs and lots of nooks and crannies, this might not be the best vacuum cleaner because of its size and weight. But it's perfect for me!"
2,Don't buy for pet hair!,"This vacuum has good suction and decent attachments. However, if you are going to be sweeping up pet hair then do yourself a big favor and don't buy this vacuum. The hair, along with most of the other waste gets caught in the upper part of the chamber. In order to remove it, you have to reach into there with your hands and physically remove the filth. This is tedious, disgusting & unsanitary and totally defeats the purpose of a bagless vacuum."
3,sweeper,"it does pick up, but now after few years, it is not picking up as well, plus the filtration system sucks. Will be going back to bag sweeper next time I buy."
5,Great Machine,This machine is the best one I have ever had. I love the ease of use. I like the fact that I don't have to buy sweeper bags anymore. It is easy to empty and clean.
5,Still holding up strong after nearly 3 years,"I purchased a Bissell Cleanview around 3 years ago, based on great reviews on amazon. I live in a 2 bedroom apartment, no kids and no pets. This vacuum works great on carpet and floor. Picks up hair really well, does a good job on the upholstery and after nearly 3 years of use it's showing no signs of slowing down. I clean the filters occasionally, really easy to do. Not had to replace any parts yet. The bagless feature is convenient. I love this vacuum and would purchase it again! The only caveat is that the bagless feature may not work so well for someone with allergies."
3,"Worked well for 1 year, .....","Bissell 3596 CleanView Revolution Deluxe Upright Bagless VacuumI purchased the Vacuum in April 2006. Today I have officially come to terms with the fact that it doesn't pick up anything any longer. The first year seemed pretty easy....vacuum and dispose of garbage.The 2nd year has been a series of band issues. The band comes off about every other I time I vacuum. Despite the pain, I would open the cover and put the band back.I do have a 2-3bedroom apartment and vacuum maybe 1-2 times a week so I guess two years isn't bad???I did previously have a Sears Kenmore and it lasted for years and years it seems but the life on this one was 2 years. Have cleaned it, repaired it, changed filters and still not picking up.Just thought I would come back and let everyone know. First year great...after the first year...NOT SO MUCH.I guess for $130 I paid its not too bad.Good Luck!"
4,Bissell,"Cleans up the particles that you never knew were there! Nicely equipped, not too heavy to lift, extra long cord - all in all a spectacular bargain for the purchase price."
1,"Dusty, noisy, cumbersome","It seems like I've had to do maintenance on this vacuum prior to each use, as if housecleaning isn't work enough! Cleaning filters, unclogging the hose, reattaching the hose, etc... It's dusty and messy and has been since about the 3rd use. The only thing that's been consistent is the dust coming back out. It's too loud and messy and I'm kicking it to the curb next trash pickup. Wish me luck on my next attempt! Dirt Devils and Bissells are out for me."
1,JUNK,"This vacuum is junk, it has to many filters that plug up with dust and dirt, then you have to take them all apart to clean the filters if you want to suck up anything. A dirty mess..."
2,"Good vacuum, but LOUD!!!","This vacuum was actually pretty nice, it did a fine job and was relatively easy to push and pull. However, and that's a big however, the wheels squeaked from very early on. I thought I could get used to it, or that my husband could fix it, but after a year, I had to get rid of it! It drove me insane! The noise was like fingernails on a chalkboard. It was high pitched, and never ever let up. My husband is pretty mechanically inclined, meaning he should have been able to fix it if it was fixable, but he never could get it to stop. I can't believe I just spent over $100 again in a little over a year on a vacuum, but I just couldn't stand it anymore. Maybe I just got a dud, I don't know, if it weren't for the wheels, I'd for sure still use it."
2,There's nothing in the center of these bones like when you buy them at the store!,"I usually buy these at my local pet shop, but thought I'd buy these in the bulk package. I wasn't very happy with them, because the center's of all these have completely cleaned out. My dogs like to chew through the hard marrow usually left behind. They also like the other stuff in the center of the bones when you buy them from pet stores. All that's left on these bones is what you see on the outside, which isn't much. My dogs wouldn't even chew on these ones, for more than about 20 minutes. They chew on the ones from the store with all the gunk, and marrow in them for days. So, while I like them due to being less messy, it's really about the dogs opinion of them, and they didn't rank them very high on their chew list."
1,Not the right movie,"I was hoping for the fun, happy cheerfulness of Jennifer Anniston in Wanderlust. This garbage impersonation of a decent movie didn't last 10 minutes before I realized that this drab, boring punch to the face was not what I was looking for."
4,It's a decent story,"I'm a Sabrina Lloyd fan, i like anything she is in. Her name drew me to this movie and i was not disappointed. It's a good story movie, nice scenery and put together well."
4,Ivan Scott is the new Nicholas Sparks!,Our book club recently finished Ivan Scott's An Invincible Summer and we found it to be a wonderful story of romance with a slice of humor and inspiration thrown in. Ivan came to our book club to speak last week and he was as gracious and self-effacing as he could be. Our Club recommends this book for all fans of tear jerking romantic fiction!
3,Good not Great,"I used this product with extremely low expectations. The item we used the paint on was a thrity year old water heater cover that resides in our kitchen. Before we used it on the heater cover we practiced on a range hood that we were discarding. I strongly suggest practicing on a non-valuable appliance before using. This is an all day job. More than one coat is needed and the results are good but not great. However, we did try multiple solutions and this was by far the best."
3,Works as advertised,Used it about a month ago to coat some scratches on our refrigerator in the garage. Worked as advertised. After drying you can't tell where the spot touch-ups are on the machine.
4,It's spray paint!,"What can I say? It's spray paint. I used it to repaint an old puke-green KitchenAid mixer. The paint is not very glossy, but more of a matte that looks good when repainting something completely. I could not see using it to touch up my refrigerator, which is a glossy finish. I suppose if you carefully sand between coats you can get a glossy appearance, but I cannot confirm that. If you're careful and don't overspray too much, you'll get good results. I didn't get any runs on the mixer, and that could be due to the nature of the epoxy paint."
4,A Good Afternoon of Reading,"I thought the book was very good, although a bit unbelievable in parts. Jessica was the one you were cheering for, and Tilly wasn't, but by the end, you wanted them both to be happy, so you find yourself cheering for them both. If you have a rainy afternoon or just want to spend the day in bed with a good book, this is an excellent choice."
5,about the book,Super cute designs. Lots of matching to make a set. Wonderful color charts. Lots of finishing instructions too. With 101 your sure to find an ornament that fits your style.
2,Poor Choice,"Prior to this purchase I had been using 3M purple sanding belts. Thought that by using these Porter Cable belts on my Porter Cable sander I would be able to economize while still obtaining good results. Wrong! False economy! Sanding a new deck, I wore out/broke five PC belts to every one 3M belt. From now on, I will purchase only 3M. They cost a bit more, but they last and last and last!!"
1,would recommend this only to people I dislike,This case scratched my Ipods screen the moment it was put in the case for the first time. My ipod was cleaned with a soft cloth and checked before it went into the case. Even the inside of the case was scratched so that is now useless.
3,Desk Shelf,"Over all, this is a good product. It is a bit flimzy on top with the wire, so things have to be carefully placed sometimes. Looks good, and is a space saver. Would recommend."
4,Wish I'd found it earlier,"I use this on a workbench that used to be cluttered with power cords and communications equipment. This has enabled me to create a two-tier storage area, and it works very well."
5,Standing desk on the cheap!,"Where many other people saw a wire mesh off surface shelf, I saw the perfect riser for standing desk to place my keyboard and mouse on. I am 5'5"" and was previously using reams of paper to elevate my keyboard and mouse so I could stand up while I work. This shelf is absolutely perfect in terms of it's height, length and width. The only thing that sticks over the side is the end of the mousepad, but I have plenty of area to use it. If you are trying to create a standing desk on the cheap you can't go wrong with this cool looking and inexpensive stand/ shelf!"
4,Nice item for organizing your router and cable box,"Great space saver if you want to stack things like a router, cable box, or blu ray player. Quality looks to be OK, and set up was easy.I should point out that the listed dimensions are 26 x 9.5 x 2 inches but it's actually about 7 inches high, rather than 2."
3,Update: Worked well but broke quickly,"I used this vacuum like crazy for a couple of days. It did a really good job. However, about the 3rd time I used it, the power head tool froze up and quit working. Also, the dial that adjusts for the carpet height broke the first time we tried adjusting it to vacuum a bare floor. I am sending it back for a replacement. Hopefully we just got a bad one. I am going to try again because the vacuum itself worked great. It is quick and easy to empty, has powerful suction, and the power head did a great job on the furniture and curtains.We got a new one and had no problems with it. Used it for a long time."
1,Maintenance mess and poor performer,"This was my first and last bagless unit. Don't assume bagless means convenience or less mess. The unit is high maintenance, requiring frequent filter disassembly and cleaning. The dirt never makes it to the dirt container. After several calls to Bissell customer service and new filter kits, the representative claimed the unit is not suited for everyday or light vacuuming. Seems the small particles clog the filter and restrict access to the dirt container. I don't believe the unit is capable of handling heavy vacuuming due to its poor suction. My expectations were not high considering the $89 price, but I expected more than a single use unit."
4,Excellent Performer& Value,"This is another really good machine from Bissel.Powerful (all 12amp vacuums are strong) with a useful hose and attachments. I especially like the cyclonic cup system and the way you can remove the cup and all the chambers for cleaning (I do it in the tub and use the shower nozzle). That's a must with this machine ... keep it clean or it won't work well. I think this is the frustration some people have with these bagless vacuums.Filters should be cleaned each time it's used ... and it takes a few minutes plus drying time.The turbo brush works well ... but you can't work it too hard or you will get the `melting' that others here complain about. You need to have a light touch to keep the roller spinning at high speed and if you are using this thing for more than 20 minutes at a time, you need to give it a rest.All of these consumer vacuums are plastic (even the ones costing $400+) so be reasonable when using it. If it's melting, the user is pushing it too hard."
1,"Plastic piece of ""S...""",After just 1 year the belt had rubbed on a small metal guard attached to plastic and melted that which then caused the belt to rub against the plastic belt cover. Apparently cannot buy those parts from Bissell and it is out of warranty. POOR ENGINEERING DESIGN!
4,Great Vacuum for the price,"I was looking into getting a mid-line vacuum for about $200. Saw this one at Target, but there was no price. It ended up being only $74.99 and I immediately bought it.Once home, it was extremely easy to assemble. I vacuumed a rug that I had just vacuumed the same morning and it picked up an entire compartment full of dirt/dust/pet hair.The thing I am most happy about is that it has the suction power to get the crumbs out of the cracks in my hardwoods. We have a log home with 8in pine floors, that have settled. So there are cracks between the boards, some up to 1/4 inch wide. With 3 children and 2 cats, these cracks get easily filled with crumbs/dirt/fuzz, etc. When using my previous vacuum, I had to do it by hand with the attachment. With this CleanView, I just set the level on Floor and it works. My aching back thanks Bissell.I only gave it 4 stars, because I have only used it 3 times, so I can not rate the longevity of the produce."
2,More dust and dirt everywhere!!!,"We were so excited about our new vacuum. However, this thing is the dirtiest thing ever! The disposing of dirt and cleaning of filters is the messiest thing! Every time you clean it, which is every use, your are sneezing and there is more dust in the air than before. It does not do the job and I would not recommend it. I can't wait to throw it away."
2,Liftoff doesn't get off the pad,Don't waste your money. this is poorly done documentary. I was expecting some exciting footage but this doesn't work for me.
3,A disappointment . . . but still good,"This one is not up to the usual Spacecraft Films standard (I own many of these sets, I love the Apollo 15 & 17 6 six disc sets, particularly. Not to mention the Saturn series, the Gemini, etc). I was disappointed in this one but still it was ok, I mean there is not much of an alternative is there? Looking forward the the X-15 discs. I hope they are more comprehensive then this set."
1,You get what you pay for,"I bought this cartridge and a multi pack. All of the cartridges work okay, but the colors are poor and several cartridges failed before they were empty. I would try another brand the next time for sure!"
5,Music for quiet listening.,"I bought this CD for Sir Neville Marriner's recording of Elgar's Serenede for Strings, but I was hoping I would enjoy the other selections. I have, especially ""The Lark Ascending."" Regarding the ""Serenede for Strings,"" I doubt a more level-headed rendition of the piece exists. Things on this CD are ""played straight."" I have heard another rendition of the ""Serenede,"" in which the conductor and orchestra constantly changed tempo and seemed to lack any understanding of the piece's form. Not so here. Everything sounds even and natural. The tracks on this CD seem to evoke scenes of spring and the countryside, although there's nothing wrong with listening to them against a winter backdrop. Except for ""Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli"" (Track 6), this CD is tailor made for relaxing and/or moments of quiet reflection. Not that there's anything wrong with Track 6--it's just stylistically darker and more bombastic than the other tracks. In sum, highly recommended."
5,English Beauty,"Nobody does English music like Neville Marriner. He and his cohorts on this recording, especially violinist Iona Brown, prove this convincingly. Brown's interpretation of ""The Lark Ascending"" is at once plaintive and breath-takingly serene. Having had the privelege to hear her perform this live, I am all the more impressed with her skill and soul.Marriner wields his baton in a moving rendition of ""Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis."" The ebb and flow of sound wash over the listener in great sweeps and brilliant colors. A perfect piece to listen to while meditating or romancing!One of my all-time favorite recordings, I highly recommend this."
3,Interesting and fun to read,An interesting and fun reading. I enjoyed Christopher Hart's (aka William Napier) wonderful writing style. He balances a nice rich descriptive narrative with an ease of reading. Educators might consider the book for students (9-12) as a supplement to their study of the Roman era. The book is part a three book trilogy and I am looking forward to reading the final two volumes in the series.
3,"Enjoyable, light reading","Enjoyable, historical novel. Easy reading, although the characters were a little one dimensional. Good light reading for those who enjoy history but are not into too much detail. I will probably finish out the series."
1,Waste of Time,"I thought I was getting a Conn Igullden type novel, but unfortunately was soorly disappointed in this far too fictional tale of a number of characters one of which happended to be Atilla the Hun. I don't know why this book is titled ""Atilla"". I will not be purchasing any more of Mr. Napier's works."
2,Supposition in Place of Facts,"Napier starts out his work with the confession that he knows very little factual information about Attila. He then goes on to say but given the little actually known it might be inferred that certain events played out in a particular way. What mindless drivel. This book goes on and on making up out of whole cloth insights and personal details that the author admits he cannot state with any reliable basis. When all is said and done, your pocket has been picked for the price of the book."
3,Too Many Coincidences,"Some of this book is good but there are too many coincidences, such as when the good guys arrive just in time to save Attila's and Aetius's lives out in the middle of the steppes. Also there are sloppy misspellings of Roman words and the names of cities--""Noviomagnus,"" for instance, instead of ""Noviomagus."" Attila is such a little prick he doesn't gain much sympathy from me. I guess that's the way it's supposed to be, but it's annoying at times. I'll probably read the rest of these books when they come out but I'm not anxiously awaiting them."
3,Skip the first two,"There's not a whole lot of background laid out in the first two parts of this trilogy that are required to enjoy the third book, which I liked the most and really starts where the first novel should have. I guess I could whine about elastic stretches of narrative plausibility and historical accuracy but overall I thoroughly enjoyed the yarn inserted into the sweeping historical context presented in the last book."
2,not enough pop-up,"I bought this book for my daughter-in-law for Christmas, along with another pop-up-book. I was dissappointed because while there are slide-outs and lots of information, the only real pop-up is in the center of the book. The other pop-up book was wonderful, and maybe I'm only comparing the two, but like I said; a real dissappointment."
4,A gift for my son,This is the last book of Lamour's Hopalong Cassidy series. Gave it to my son as a gift. He says it is not as good as the first three.
3,A good review but some elements lacking,The book is a good review of the field of psych. and offers good practice for the GRE. If you take the practice tests and study the topics on them you should be ok for the GRE. Not perfect though. Some areas on the real GRE are lacking on this one but it should help somewhat.
3,Sex,"And more sex. It was an ok book and Im all for sex but I like at least a little plot to go with it. While there was a small plot, the way the story went you had the book figured out and after that it was just sex. LOTS of sex. At least the sex scenes were good."
2,If you like sex...,"They do it every place imaginable in UNTAMED. And it's hot. But the story is so-so, and the characters are forgettable. Think of a tired Lifetime television movie you happen to catch on cable one afternoon...that you skip by. Kathleen Lawless has moments of greatness, but she sells out to the all mighty buck for a quick sale with a transparent story."
1,This Stunk! Period,"My title says it all and I have read hundreds and hundreds of these books. Kathleen Lawless can't seem to write anything but sex scenes. No plot, no romance. Just sex, sex and more sex. If you really want a romance story stay away from this author (porn scene writer)."
3,not bad,"This album is Terry Durham reading his poems and stories with a backround of blues or basic jazz. It is one of those records that could have only been made in the late 60s, early 70s.Chrystal Telephone is fun to listen to, for both musical and nostalga reasons, but the album tends to stick to one sound, and drag after a little while.But it does have some fun parts, and if you like those strange little cornors of 60s rock, this is good to have, even if your reason is just to say you own it."
1,yawn,This tome of boredom is written in 1960's style psycobable and is the next thing to unreadable. It has a type of launguage all its oun and if you are not connected deeply with the 60 culture you will be totally unable to connect with its ideas. It deserves to be out of print.
2,"Basic, how-to-play book","While this book has some basic information, it's not very comprehensive and certainly isn't a ""Winner's Guide."" Most of the pages are filled up with examples and while they are useful, it could have been better filled with more strategy tips.A very good section of the book is ""Ways Omaha is Different From Hold Em"" That section is a must read for Hold Em players wanting to make the switch to Omaha. However the other sections in the book (Odds and outs, reading hands) could have been pared down greatly and condensed. The remaining space could have been used for more decision making advice.Most of the information in the book you can find free on the internet. The advice is good and sound, but there's not much of it for the number of pages in this book."
2,An introduction to Omaha only...,"This book assumes you are coming from hold'em and does a good job of showing the difference between hold'em and Omaha hi-lo. It shows you winning high and low Omaha hands by showing you different card combinations. It does a good job of showing you how to figure out the outs you have, and generally what to look for in starting hands without being specific. What it doesn't cover is the play of the hand. The book uses big font and has a lot of card graphics that take up space. The two chapters at the end are filler on tournament play in general that applies to both Omaha and hold'em, and internet poker. Then there is a glossary, and several pages of advertisement for other books."
3,Sent previously,I sent a review about 10 days ago; I was wondering why you did not run it. Could you let me know? Thank you.
5,Excellent Perspective on the History of the Hospital System,I read this book when I was considering returning to school for an MD. It gave me an excellent historical perspective on medicine in the US. A must for anyone interested in the history of medicine and in the changes taking place today in the health care system.
2,not so great,we purchased this for our 10 year old. all i really have to say is that you get what you pay for. ;( the quality is very low and video very grainy. :(
4,nicer than expected,"These nesting tables are really a great size and look. They work really well as side tables for a party and then are easily put away to save space. I like to have buffet dinner parties for 10 or more people and these extra tables make it work perfectly so everyone gets a place to put there food and drink. They are on the smaller/lower side of the scale but this works for my modern chaise that they are next to as it is low as well - so the scale works - the acrylic is thick and sturdy and very clear! - nice job!JB - Oakland, CA."
4,Everything said in the reviews is true,"True, those tables are very pretty.True they are very small.So if you are looking for very small pretty clear nesting tables, this will be good to you. If you are looking for something a little larger, you will not be happy."
2,Miniature Tables,"Not only are these tables small, but they lack the standard height of an end table. When I opened the box, it looked like they belonged in a playhouse. I should have sent them back, but it really was my fault for not paying attention to the dimensions. I was just excited to find these types of acrylic nesting tables. Anyway, they look fine in a master bedroom, not in a formal livingroom. With just one little single flower in a very tall glass vase sitting on this table, it's very simple and elegant."
2,rather flimsy for the price,"For the price, I expected thicker, sturdier tables. These are a little flimsy and it's very easy to bump them and have everything fall over that may be on them."
3,"Good book, poor translation?","I don't understand why so many reviews of this book describe it as funny. I never laughed out loud, and only rarely smiled while reading this book.I enjoyed it, but so many times the dialog seemed stilted (I would think, 'who the hell talks like that?', which is a distraction while reading). The narrative parts seemed poorly translated as well, but not knowing italian and therefor not having read the original, I can't say for sure.But since I approached it as light summer reading, these flaws did not detract too much (not nearly as much as the poor editting of some american light reading)."
1,Truly Disappointing,"I was looking for a new series to read, so thought I would try this one, since it's the first. After reading all the complimentary reviews, I expected to really enjoy the book and to go on to others. I didn't like any of the characters, including the main one, so this is it for me. Many of the characters seemed like poorly developed stereotypes."
2,"Decent read, but why so vulgar?","I bought the first three of Camilleri's books, mostly to read on a vacation in Sicily. I'd done the same with Donna Leon's books on a trip to Venice and enjoyed mixing fiction and setting. But I found these books less enjoyable.The stories are in themselves mostly enjoyable, with some particularly clever parts, but all three were quite vulgar, with generous doses of very crude sexual and homosexual banter. It seemed so contrived and stereotypically alpha-male macho, and did not add to the story or the characters. I can accept that a certain amount of this kind of thing might find it's way into stories involving pimps, prostitutes, murders, mafioso, and the like, but it just didn't add to the story at all, and seemed more out of place in otherwise well written story. Is this here to titilate us? Spare me, please.I did go ahead and read all three, so it wasn't enough to stop me from reading what I'd brought along, but I won't buy any more."
3,It was alright,"The book store recommend it and I read it. It was alright, but nothing special. It had it moments and it was pretty short. It was well written, but that's not what I'm looking for. I like fast-paced, action thrillers, which this wasn't."
3,A good audiobook,This was a good book to listen to - the accents (and correct name pronunciation) brought the book alive.
4,Nicely Understated Debut,"The Inspector Montalbano series is hugely popular in Europe, and with this book, the Sicilian policeman makes his English language debut... I'm not sure why, but some reviews have described him as a lethargic, cynical, and reluctant character-which he is none of. He is realistic within the constraints of the highly political and corrupt system, but he has a huge streak of compassion and empathy, and is certainly not lethargic. There are no big surprises at the end, but the real treat is in the journey and getting to know this likable policeman. A small note:... I say curious because I can't recall a single mention of wine, and only two or three meals are described, and then only very briefly-so I'm not sure why the publisher felt the need to make a pretense of gastronomic delights. In any event, it's deftly translated and nicely understated book that gives a very tangible sense of Sicily."
3,A good start...,"I have several friends and family members who are fans of the Mantalbano series, and who have been urging me to read these books forever. So I finally picked up the first one, as I do enjoy books set in Italy, even if mystery is not my favorite genre.After a bit of a slow start (there are very many characters introduced, some without a lot of set-up), I did eventually find myself quite engaged in the story and wanting to find out how it all ended. Montalbano is an interesting character, although we don't learn a great deal about him in this first book (I'm told to expect the later books to get better). The Italian politics and societal issues may be difficult for foreign readers to fully comprehend, but at the core of it all is a tight mystery, with several unexpected twists and turns to leave you guessing.I will continue to read the books in this series as it is fairly light reading, and opens up a unique window on life (and death) in Sicily."
3,"Shape of Water, by Andrea Camilleri",This novel was somewhat of a disappointment as I had hoped it would be on a par with a series written by Donna Leon. It definitely was not. Maybe that was because I don't find Sicily as appealing as Venice. It was still worth the time reading it.
1,Horribly flat and under developed,"I ruined my vacation read (to Italy, none the less) on this book. It is impossibly flat-I had to read the first chapter 3 times because I felt like I had to be missing something- and to me, under developed. It seemed like so much was left out in regard to introducing characters, and then just having them evaporate. Aside from the style and mechanics of the story, it was horribly lewd. It was disgusting to read, however, when I realized that this was a 70 year old man writing I was sufficiently repulsed; I assumed that discretion came with age. Don't get me wrong, I understand that certain characters are lewd, therefore lewd acts and language are required. However, this was over the top and unnecessary. I can usually find a bright spot in every book, but not this one. Reader beware!"
2,Poorly translated,I am sure this is a great book. This is the first in his series. The translation is correct in the words used however the sentences and overall writing is off. Not impossible to read but i find myself re-reading sections trying to figure out what the author was trying to convey.
5,"Review ""Shape of Water""",I love all the Inspector Montalbano books. A very likeable and human man with a complicated love life. The characteristics of his staff are hilarious.
4,Attitude and character development,"I liked this and have ordered the next three. There is a well developed sense of place and tone. The characters have possibility. I like the detective in spite of him, kind of. I mean that in a good way. The plot was a little usual for an Italian type police mystery but I'm expecting the later books to develop things more."
4,The Shape of the Writing,"Th Shape of Water is our introduction to Andrea Camilleri's Inspector Montalbano- Vigata, Sicily's most respected Detective and what an intro they both make! Montalbano has what looks to be a simple death on his hands in an area favored by pimps and prostitutes but with Camilleri you get more than just a 'simple' death. You get Old World politics and corruption, weekly Mafia retribution murders, good to great food, slashed tires as a hobby, and a few women who are more than willing to say grazie to Montalbano for some other undercover work.A good read and a nice twist on the whodunnit, especially for those of us just discovering why Camilleri is an International besetselling author. The best thing about coming late to this party is the ability to stay around to read the rest of the series!Thanks to the reviews section for turning me on to yet another good author.And may I say, come on in, the water's fine."
5,Welcome to a different Sicily,"Once again we are in Vigata on the Sicilian Coast (and the birthplace of the author). Salvo Montalbano, the local keeper of the law, brings his humanity and knowledge of the local customs to a vexing case: the victim - engineer Silvio Luparello - of murder most foul was not blown away by a lupara, but ostensibly died in the performance of a manly occupation.Open and shut case. Delicious, but not true. Montalbano recognizes a murder when he sees it and then unravels the events.The world of Montalbano is a wonderful world indeed, including his permanent fiancee Livia (who lives on the mainland), colorful locals and interesting food. Much fun can be had by reading this book."
4,Great Preparation Tool,"I ordered this book to prepare for the Eligiblity Worker I examp in the state of California. I found the test to be much easier than the book prepared me for, but that was a good thing! The sampe exams and questions are practical and useful, you just need to get past the way the information is based on a different state's welfafe system."
3,The low budget squashes some good ideas,"First of all, we have to realize that Bram Stoker played a little loose with the truth, and Lucy Westenra survived her little run-in with Van Helsing. She's still around, and somehow managed to get ahold of the stake used to kill Dracula(yeah, I know it was supposed to be a Bowie knife - that darn Stoker!). She takes the stake to the resident mad scientist, who uses the genetic material still on it to clone the Count! Adapting rapidly to modern times, the Count also wishes the doc to use genetic engineering to eliminate this problem he has with sunlight... There's a couple of good ideas in here, sadly the filmmakers didn't have enough money to capitalize on them and wind up falling into typical low-budget hi-jinks and cliches; still pretty inventive for a zero budget flick."
4,great chocolate cookies,"I made 4 recipes from the book, they all turned out perfectly. The chocolate crinkles were unbelievable. The sugar cookies with icing were also very good as well, and very easy to roll out."
3,Not too impressed,"I found that the cookies in this book that are actually fun and creative, are by far outnumbered by the usual, standard recipes that can be found in any cookie book.I expected more inspiration from this book!"
1,Why does everything cost?,Mine is more a question. Everything has a price on it. Why can't you offer a recipe for free so a person can try it out. I can find so many things on the net for free. Even cookie recipes that I don't need to buy a book for. Because most people want to share what they have. Thank you.
4,What a wonderfully written story!!!,"Reading Lily and Morgan's story was a treat. Ms. Lee weaves a tender story about finding oneself. Lily was always a bit of a wild child and when trouble arises, society is willing to think the worst of her. The character of Lily is well developed and extremely likable. She is strong, but deep down just wants acceptance like everyone else. Morgan is a perfect foil for her and though has misgivings of his own, is there for her. The plot takes twists and turns that I did not expect, and thus completely appreciated. Unlike so many stories today, which seem to end abruptly, as if the author has reached a deadline, Crimson Lace, rolls to a comfortable and satisfying end.There are many levels to this story, and I wonder if the story shouldn't be called something like 'The Many Betrayals of Lily'. She has my vote for woman of the year! With the help of many colorful secondary characters, and steamy, tention filled scenes, this story is well worth the read."
3,Pretty Good Boot.,This is a nice looking and effective winter boot. But I would not consider it waterproof----based on experience. I bought a pair of North Face boots at the same time and there is absolutely no comparison except that these boots weigh less. The North Face boots are much better made and are serious about keeping out the cold and wet. These boots are a good price and pretty cute but if you need serious snow boots you can do better.
5,"Better than ""Buena Vista Social Club""","If you liked the ""Buena Vista Social Club"" soundtrack and CD, you will love this too.I first heard this playing in an upscale local restaurant, and had to ask the management for the name of the CD. Since buying it, I've turned several people on to this excellent collection of cuban jazz."
4,Pharmagel Glyco-8,"I ordered the Pharmagel Glco-8 8% AHA Facial Firming Complex to use in conjunction with other Pharmagel products I am currently using. I currently use : Hydra Cleanse ( LOVE the smell and lightness ), Botanical Tonique- I am one of these people that likes a toner, and HydrO 2 XY-10 Moisturizer for day use. I use the GLYCO-8 for night, it does not have the same wonderful smell as the Hydra Cleanse. My skin feels so soft, I know with continued use it will just get better. The prices on amazon can't be beat, I have not been disappointed. Thank-you"
1,LOST LAKE: Recommended ONLY if you like bad movies.,"This movie, also known as ""Peak Experience,"" is a confused, silly mess. It makes the grade only as a ""so bad it's good""/""what were they thinking?"" curiosity piece.Normally I would not bother making a review for a video such as this, but I wanted to offset the two ridiculously glowing reviews that it received here, presumably from the DVD distributors. At least one of them had enough shame to refrain from giving it five stars."
1,"definetly NOT a ""must have""","Lets be honest, I bought the movie because of Angel Boris and not much else. What I got was a little of Angel Boris and not much else. So all my expectations should be matched? Hmm, not really. I would expect even a basic nice story of any movie, but this movie left no impression at all. It is kind of a movie that you'll just forget after you took the DVD out of the player.1 Star for Angel Boris, 0 for the storyline."
4,Lost Lake: An exciting mystical adventure,"LOST LAKE is a unique, mystical adventure story shot in the the high Sierra mountains. Definitely not a cookie-cuttter film, Lost Lake is a good example of what independent filmmaking used to be before it was coopted by the studios. Fun, sexy, thought-provoking entertainment with excellent acting and dialogue. Give it a try. Highly recommended."
5,Great recycle bin!,I have been using this as my recycle bin for many months now and there is no problem at all.It is sturdy and stylish.
3,A bit to tall for what I initially needed.,"THey charged me $40 for shipping a $15 basket. The basket is good looking though, but its a bit too high for what I really needed it for. About one and 1/4 of a foot."
5,Great Product,"This was just what I was looking for, very sturdy! I would recommend this for anyone looking to store trash."
5,Goes Great With Other Mesh Rubbermaid Office Products...,"Sturdy, durable and sleek. In three words that sums up this wastebasket; it is just fantastic. Most of my organizers and other office equipment are black and mesh and this coordinates perfectly with them. Rubbermaid and Rolodex both intermix well especially in this black mesh design. Comparing prices between local stores and Amazon have this product priced nearly the same. I bought this at my local store to have it quicker however it's cost effective at the current price of under $10 no matter where you buy it."
5,Great Wastebasket,Does what it's supposed to do. High quality and looks great. The wastebasket I received didn't have any dents as others have complained. I will be ordering more.
3,Good little waste basket,"It's exactly as described and exactly what I needed, but it's very easily bendable, so you have to be gentle with it or it will get distorted. I got it for the office though, so it's just going to be holding paper and such anyway"
2,Shipping method stinks,"When I received this wastebasket, it was somewhat warped. The mesh is very thin, and easily dents. It serves it's purpose."
5,Stylish and Sturdy,This is the perfect size for my small office. It's stylish--I'm not afraid to let clients see it--and it's sturdy enough to do what it's meant to do. Definitely recommended.
5,AMAZING,"very durable and just like i thought, a trash can thats actually good looking in any room and decent size, won't be disappointed!"
4,Rumis Rumination,"A 3-D game for one to four players with six options that use spatial and intellectual abilities. Constructing multi-level structures results in mind building and surprise challenges. Smart choice for adults too. To me, somewhat pricey but am glad I bought it."
2,Not as easy as it looks,"This is a beautiful paint by number, but you have to do your own mixing of certain colors and do other techniques that make this painting more for people who are more skilled at this NOT FOR BEGINNERS!"
3,Dog doesn't like the gurgle noise,"This product is alright. It's not as good a quality as I've seen with some of these though. I had one by another maker, but I bought this because I wanted a larger one for my dog as she drinks so much water she goes through the smaller one I have very quickly. The thing is that this one gurgles a lot more than the other one she had and it actually scares her so she won't drink from it no matter how thirsty she is. If you have a dog who is scared of everything like mine, this is probably not the one for you. The one I have is for cats and I guess it doesn't freak her out because it's made for scaredy cats like her!"
2,A YEAR LATER,I have owned one of these for about a year. It started out fine but as time went by a petrochemical odor developed and became stronger and stronger to the point it became overwhelming when I opened it. Don't know much about plastics but know that cant be good for my dogs. Tried to save myself some time filling water dish's everyday but guess there is no way around it unless they start making these things out of glass / porcelain.
3,Pet Water feeder,"I had this product and it lasted about 24 months when the plastic tank developed a crack and leaked water on the floor. I liked it a lot and will buy another. The tank is rather heavy for an older person to lift, perhaps a one gallon would be better."
4,pet items reviewed,This was a great selection. Very easy to operate and does the job well. I look forward to using this product for a long time.
5,Bergan Petite Gourmet 1.5 Gallon Waterer,Just what my dog needed..! I love this it holds a crap load of water and it does not tip over if your looking for something like this buy it you will love it.. I did have a smaller one I had to put water init 2to3 times a day now with this I only have to fill it up every few days loving it ...!!! Great buy
4,Happy Chocolate Lab!!,Our family dog is a 110lb lab that drinks a lot! We were re-filling his water bowl 3-4 times per day. We needed an answer. This product did the trick. It is priced well for the quality. We had to wash it several times to get the chemical/plastic smell out of it but it finally went away. After filling it with water for the first time our Lab didn't hesitate to drink out of it. This will last him 2 days! It's easy to fill and the tab at the bottom allows you to invert it without making a mess.
3,Works fine but didn't fit my needs,"This waterer works as described, but my cat doesn't like to drink out of it. Because the dish is very large and uncovered, the water gets dirty very quickly and even though new water is added regularly it immediately mixes with the dirty water. My cat is very picky and won't drink water that is more than a day or two old, so I just ended up wasting a lot of water by using this product. That being said, it might come in handy for someone with a less picky cat."
4,Sturdy waterer but it collects debris!,"I was very happy with this waterer; I bought it because I was leaving town for a week and knew my pet water fountain would run out of water way before I returned... This waterer definitely had enough of a reservoir to last the week, but since it's not constantly re-circulating like my other one, cat hair and cat food had collected in the bowl by the time I came home... At least I knew they had water while I was gone!The plastic that it's made of is definitely sturdy - I wasn't worried about it tipping over. Plus it's really easy to clean. I went back to using my electric pet fountain now that I'm home again, but will definitely use this waterer when I go away!"
3,Okay for price,The water tank is rather thin plastic so it should be handled w/care. I like the depth of the base since my cats don't spill it as easily as they do w/ a different brand. I think it is currently a decent value w/ the 4 for 3 promotion and am glad I bought it.
2,Ungourmet Cat Waterer,"I'm disappointed with this cat waterer. I don't know what constitutes it being called ""Gourmet"". It's looks nice but it's very hard to pick up if you need to pour some of the water out to freshen it, due to the bowl being a very flexible plastic/rubber--being hollow underneath instead of solid. I would never have purchased it had i known this."
4,For the Dogs,"I bought the Petite Gourmet because it was the right size for the dogs I have and because I can clean the inside of the water bottle. My experience with auto watering devices that they yucky inside and the ones that have small caps cannot be cleaned except with bleach then it takes a week before the dogs will drink the water. With this one I unscrew the wide mouth lid and stick my hand in and clean it with just a cloth. The device I had before this one was the next size up. I found that the water went stale before the dogs drank it. This size is just about perfect. The only complaint I have is that when the bottle is placed on the base, it snaps into place. I found it difficult to get the two apart. To mitigate the problem, I used the base from the old larger unit with this bottle. Since the bottle for this unit is a little smaller it does not snap into place and it is easy to lift the bottle without spilling water all over myself."
4,My cat loves this,"As the designated human for Mr Kushman I am, as instructed, letting y'all know that he loves his water dish."
3,Water bottle occasionally sticks and can not be removed,"If you allow water bottle to slip into locking slots; I have yet to be able to easily get the bottle off the base. We do not allow bottle to 'lock' on. Other than that one complaint, I love it."
2,Bergan Elite Gourmet Waterer,"It is too heavy for me when filled. Three gallons weights 24 lbs and I'm an old lady :-) Otherwise, it works great. This is not your fault, it's mine. I did not consider the weight when I ordered it. It's well constructed, however."
5,"looks nice, works well",got the 1.5 gallon size. serves my 2 mid size dogs for 3 days.looks nice. nicer looking then the blue kind with water cooler style tank (which stopped working for me).
5,FANTASTIC PRODUCT,"This is a FANTASTIC PRODUCT!!Water jug is heavy plastic and didn't have the ""Plastic Smell"" some of the other brands have.It actually exceeded my expectations for the price."
4,Perfect solution,"This has solved a dilemma in my house. My 18-year-old cat is a diabetic, and always thirsty. When he's upstairs, I had been filling up the bathroom cup for him, but that got knocked over, and didn't hold much (especially when the dog got to it.) Now, I keep this waterer upstairs, and everyone is happy.The reason I didn't give it five stars, is because it is a bit of a challenge to remove and replace the screw-on top."
3,Misleading,"It clearly states that it is feeder and Waterer. Pictures shows two different items. One with a removable cover for food and one for water. All I got was the waterer. It looks okay, but it only includes ONE PIECE which is the waterer. Feeder is not included."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,"Please do not purchase...JUNK....bought for a cat, our cats, and most cats want fresh water...this unit the water sits for days. The water is not fresh and our cat avoided this unit, would never drink from it. You can have mine for free, just pay for shipping!"
1,Leaked,Horrible Horrible Horrible. Leaked. Sent back and was replaced and the new item LEAKED. Not worth the money even if it was FREE
3,INCORRECTLY DESCRIBED!,"I only purchased THIS product due to the price BECAUSE it stated Feeder AND Waterer NOT Feeder OR Waterer. This is a single item to be used for WATER only it is NOT a feeder. Although NOW I see that the description of this item has now changed to just a Waterer. That sure would have been helpful for ME.On the item itself, it does not sit well in the slot and it's difficult to manage the tiny cap once it is upside down (it's filled with water so HEAVY). You would be best to purchase another item like the pet fountain for a top fill water station."
1,Not new,"The bergan petite feeder and waterer, only work with water, no good for food. It looks like it is NOT NEW. I am not happy with the productWas the box size and packaging appropriate for the items?Way Too Big"
2,Not a good idea,My yellow lab ate this in 3 days. Every evening I would find the two pieces separated in different parts of the yard. The plastic was pretty soft and a larger dog could easily chew it to pieces. It didn't serve its purpose. My dog thought of it as a toy not a waterer...
4,Good product,"I've had it for ~ 3 months and so far so good. It does what's supposed to do, I haven't noticed any leaks. The mouth is wide enough to clean inside, and the dispensing hole small enough to make flipping over easy without water splashing all over. The only watch out is that it is a little hard to pull apart. If there is a secret to doing so I haven't figured it out yet..."
2,Meh......,Worked great for the first two weeks and then the plastic jug that holds the water cracked and it was done.
4,Wonderful!,"I was getting tired of always having to fill my dog's water bowl every couple of hours so instead of buying a bigger bowl I decided to get this--- what a great choice! Yes, it is pretty heavy with all the water (1.5 gallons!) but it is worth the money. The cap was also hard to screw on the first few times but it has gotten easier.The only thing that bothers me is that the jug is hard to pick up if you want to change the water or clean the bowl. It takes a few shakes to get the jug free from the support. Other than that, I would recommend this to anyone who needs a bigger bowl of water and is tired of having to fill their puppy's bowl every hour or so."
4,Great,"We have a small dog so this is perfect for her. Like other reviewers have said you have to move quickly to put the water container on, but other than that it is great."
3,somewhat happy,"I like that it lasts a little less than a week for every fill, but I am disappointed by the fact that the water mildew's. So I can't fill it up all the way b/c than the water turns all green. Oh, well. Nothing is perfect."
2,WARNING: WATER GETS GROSS FAST!!,"It is a good concept to not have to refill the water bowl all the time, and this product worked as advertised, but i had to return it because the water would get hair and food sediments in it. The water got gross really fast so my dog wouldn't drink from it unless i cleaned out the bowl way before the tank ran out, which defeats the purpose. i wish someone had warned me of this in the reviews before purchasing. If your pet doesn't shed or get any food in it's water bowl, or doesn't care how gross it's water gets, then this product will be good for you. Otherwise, just get a larger bowl like I'm going to do."
1,DB,"Simply does not work!I filled container with water,turned it upside down onto the base, opened water holeand it ran all of the water onto the floor!!"
2,Too hard to put in and take out,"The design is great, except that it takes a lot of pressure to put the water container into or to remove the water container from the base. Perhaps I was supposed to turn it as it entered and exited, but I couldn't find a way that made it easy. Assuming any water is present, you are going to make a mess. Maybe I am missing something, but as there were no instructions whatsoever, there is no way for me to know. I returned it and I recommend staying away. If you are OK with the install/removal issue, it could be an excellent waterer and will likely serve you well. But I can only give it 2 stars. Even if someone posts a description of how I was supposed to use it, I won't revise my review upwards. It should have come with instructions."
3,Not easy to clean. Not easy to fill.,"Boy! A dog watering bowl. How hard can it be to design a good one? Pretty hard, I guess, since I haven't found one yet that I'd give 5 stars.I've been using this one for about two years. The good thing here is that it holds 3 gallons so I only have to refill it about twice a week for my two dogs.The bad - gunk (algae, I think, or some other kind of scum) grows inside the tank and it's really hard to clean it out. Also, to refill you fill the tank with water, replace the lid, then in one clean swift movement you have to flip it over and insert it into the base before the water squirts out all over the place. Filled with water, the tank weighs over 20 lbs so this is not as easy as it sounds.I think if they'd put an airtight lid on the TOP of the tank in addition to the regular screw lid on the bottom, both these problems would go away. You could remove the top lid to reach in and clean the other end, and you could refill the tank through the top."
3,Not as pictured or described,"If you look at the picture and read the description, it is clear that you are getting two items - a waterer and a feeder. In the image, there are two plastic jugs and two green plastic trays - one on top, one on bottom. The description says: Bergan Petite Feeder and Waterer. Notice the AND. What I received was one waterer. The box says: Bergan Petite Waterer. Where is the feeder? I didn't pay half of the listed price, I paid the full price so I should have received the full product ... not just half."
3,Cheap,"I bought this because the lid on the plastic barrel on my previous waterer broke after 6 years. Even though it's the same make and model, this one is just so much cheaper in quality. I can't imagine it will last as long as the previous one. The barrel is difficult to get out of the dish and the lid doesn't screw on easily."
5,recomendado,"buen material, buena capacidad, fácil de lavar y limpiar , seguro acople y material resistente, lo recomiendo para cualquier mascota"
2,Terrible Design,"From the getgo, the threads on the top of the container are awful. It took me several tries to get the lid off. It should not be that hardto unscrew a lid! I was ready to throw it out after the first fill!Secondly, what a bad design! Put a handle on top so it's not so hard to pull from the base.What would have been really great is if the refill lid was on top, so you could fill it with a pitcher.I just bought this thing a few days ago. I can see it will have to be filled up every two days. I'm contemplating cutting a hole in the top,so I can just pour the water in every two days and only remove the thing once a week to clean it.I'm not impressed with this product."
5,"great product, good price","I really love this. It's nice and sturdy so my cat can't tip it over as he usually does with his water dishes. The water tank is very large and will be wonderful if I need to leave the apartment for a few days. Between the two cats in our apartment the amount of water lasts over a week, although it's a good idea to change it every few days to keep the bowl clean and the water fresh."
3,Does the job,"Can't get real excited over this product. It does the job, but is fairly noisy and overpriced.I purchased a dual fan laptop pad at the same time I purchased this fan. It was half the priceand much quieter. But I couldn't really find anything else that was as unobtrusive."
3,Silent Mini cooling Fan,This is a nice slient cooling fan but i guess it's quite expensive to pay $63 for a AV component cooling fan.
3,Good Adventure Novel,"This is a good adventure novel set in a future where the Earth is in the grip of an Ice Age. Civilization has crumbled and been succeeded by a variety of pre-industrial societies. This is the second book in a trilogy about North America. This book is the story of an alliance between 2 of these societies against a third pre-industrial culture, a Mongol-like horde that has crossed Beringia to conquer western North America. The story is a relatively conventional military campaign concluding with a reconstruction of the battle of Cannae. The plot has the usual romantic elements. Smith does a good job of presenting believable characters and his future Earth is interesting and described well. This book is not, however, as good as its predecessor, Snowfall. The quality of writing and plotting is better in Snowfall, which has a less conventional story line and gives a better sense of life in a barbarous age."
1,Booorrrring. . . . . . .,"I think this series is probably one of the most boring I have ever encountered. I'm not sure why I am still trying to slog my way through Kingdom's River. There isn't a single character that I care about and the writing is tedious. Especially the constant references to ""warm-time"". Who cares."
4,"Good product, but replacement product sent","I like this pencil holder. It is good sized: it's currently holding 14 pens, a letter opener, a laser pointer, an emery board, and a pair of scissors, and it isn't full yet! It's also attractive, and the base has felt pads to keep it from scratching my table top.P.S.: I ordered a ""Rolodex"" pencil holder, but received a product branded as ""Eldon Workspace"". Although the product delivered to me appears to be identical to what I ordered, I would have preferred to know about the substitution when I placed the order. (Otherwise, it seems a bit deceptive.)"
4,Works Great!,"Love this gel flask holder for triathlons and long rides. I love the fact that I don't have to deal with the sticky gel packages anymore. I used to duct tape gels onto my bike for races and then have to deal with what to do with the spent package, but I no longer have to that! It is so much easier and quicker. The First Endurance EFS Liquid Shot (which I have recently switched to) fits perfectly into the holder."
5,Excellent Overview,"This volume is replete with good reproductions of Monet's work. The largest are the vertical paintings due to the vertical format of the book. My one criticism is that the book should have been published in a horizontal format thus allowing for larger reproduction of his horizontal work (which is by far the majority). However, given the plethora of poorly reproduced books on Monet this book will be a welcome addition to any art lovers library. I also enjoyed the many extreme close-ups of paintings which help make the book similar to the gallery experience."
2,Motorhead - 'Another Perfect Day' (Metal-Is) 2 1/2 stars,"Originally released in 1983, this was the band's follow-up to 'Iron Fist' (see my review) plus you can also get a live recording of the guys on their 'King Biscuit' (see my review) CD release of this very tour. Check it out when you can. 'Another...' is the only (thank goodness) Motorhead studio effort that features one-time Thin Lizzy guitarist Brian Robertson. For certain reasons, I just wasn't able to totally dig on this album reissue. Not saying it's a bad Motorhead lp, it's just that I never was to thrilled about it. Tracks that I probably enjoyed the most were the handful of tunes that were penned by the previous line-up of Lemmy, Clarke and drummer Philthy 'Animal' Taylor. ""Back At The Funny Farm"", the ass-kicking ""Rock It"", ""I Got Mine"" and ""(Don't Need)Religion"". There are three bonus tunes added. So, what are you doubters waiting for?"
4,Underrated,"While Brian Robertson did not endear himself to Motorhead fans (or Lemmy for that matter), be careful not to throw out the baby with the bath water. There are several very strong songs on this CD, including Back at the Funny Farm, I Got Mine, the title track and a ferocious version of Hoochie Coochie Man.It may not be Ace of Spades, but it will still give your ears a pleasant blood-letting."
3,"Nice Performance, Recorded in Echo Chamber","I really enjoyed the Lindsay String Quartet's great recording of the Beethoven Late String Quartets. Those are available on the ASV label as well and are the best performances of those masterpieces I have ever heard. I was looking forward to these, and the performances remain at a high level. However, someone either turned up the reverb too much or they recorded these pieces inside an empty cathedral. I think a String Quartet is a very intimate genre, even when taken to the symphonic heights Beethoven reached for in his middle and late quartets. The coloration of sound as if played at the bottom of a well did not bring these pieces home to me. On the other hand, The Emerson String Quartet has a great collection on Deutsche Grammophon that has a sparkling performance and just the right sound. I think it is a matter of taste, but I will be reaching for those more often then these."
3,Gift for husband.,My husband keeps losing his wedges so I thought this one would work being heavier. Painting it red just in case.
2,Suitable for hard cheeses only.,"The holes are really small. This grater is suitable for hard cheeses like Romano, but forget using it for a softer cheese like cheddar."
4,Great resource for beginners,"This book, combined with the SPSS 13.0 CD-ROM is a great value.The book actually covers SPSS 11.5, even though this ""2nd edition"" is bundled with version 13.0. There are only very minor differences anyway, so it is not really a problem. There is a great section on jumping into using SPSS for some practice analysis. Much of the book is very helpful as a general stats resource, in addition to explaining SPSS-specific application. I would highly recommend it for statistics class students, though not advanced statistics. Higher graduate-level topics such as mulivariate stats are not really covered, though foundational subjects like ANOVA and Regression do get explained. The software matches the contents well, since the bundled Student Version of SPSS 13.0 likewise does not allow for multivariate analysis."
1,Bad experience,This was the worst experience I have had since purchasing from Amazon.com. The item was late and I had to spend extra cash out of my pocket to purchase another text book.
1,my software didn't work,I liked the college textbooks better. I withdrew from this class as I took too many classes but I was getting a b. I bought this book so I could pratice more and retain what I remembered for next semester and I was upset with the software and the examples in the book.
3,Still Looking,"This is not a great performance, but decent if you want two hard-to-find ballets on one disc. I was looking for a good Apollo, though, and I find this one quite dull and insensitive. The jazzy, mid-century American lightness of the score is lost on this orchestra, who play instead as if it were written a hundred years earlier. Their Orpheus is much better, so this is a good buy for someone looking for that ballet at a decent price.Note: If you are looking for Apollo, remember also to search ""Apollon Musagete."""
2,Helpful To The Novice...,"I found this book fairly uninformative for me, but I can see this book being extremely helpful to the novice junior handler. When I read this book, I had already been handling my Flat-coat and English Springer for quite some time and therefore knew a lot of the basics.Overall Review: Great for the Novice Handler, not so helpful for any handler with a couple years of experience."
5,The most comprehensive book on the subject!!!!!,"The author has done a magnificent job of covering the subject of junior handling. As a handler,I felt her book had information beneficial to handlers experienced at all levels of showing. Her knowledge of the subject was evident throughout the book."
4,A needed book for a junior handler,I was a junior handler many years ago. I wish there had been a book around like this one for us then.Its worth the reading.
4,"If you've ever showed, trained--or just loved a dog--read on","Junior Handlers, who read this book, will learn the most important handling lesson of all: that the love and respect you share with your dog will make you a winner--no matter the outcome of the competition. This easy-to-understand, carefully-written guide for junior handlers was just as much fun to read for even the non-professional, but dog-loving character, like me. For a few hours, I was well into the world of Jr. Showmanship. And I enjoyed every minute in the ring with Anne Olejniczak!"
1,..sounds like a cow run over by a lawnmover,A hell of a lot of screaming and extremely fast drumming. Maybe someone was being raped in the studio?
1,DIFFERENT ARTIST,This artist is not the same Antaeus as the one who did the albums zero4 and Byzantine Meditation. Totally different music.
4,ez fix,"I have never worked on RC cars before, but following the scewmattics made this an EZ fix. i did not up grade this part because i felt that it is durable enough for the track and rugged terrain that you would normally run your RC truck on and I try to keep my vehicles all stock anyways. they seem to hold their value better with stock parts."
5,Job Well Done,Thes stylish bookends do their job. I would recommend them to anyone looking for bookends. They are made of lightweight metal and work well.
4,A Knee Slapping Look At Bible Mythology,"Definitely not a book for Bible literalists nor for those who sincerely believe the Bible is a historical document. It is sad that this hilarious, ribald book is no longer in print. This book pokes fun at the daftness of Judeo-Christian mythology and becomes funnier with each passing page."
3,Floral gift Labels on 4 pages,"The pictures are lovely. The 8 full-color designs fail to tell you that there are only 4 pages with each page having 2 designs each about the size of a driver's license. Expected more, considering the cost of S & H.But the title accurately describes what you receive. It was my error to interpret it as 8 pages of postcard size images."
5,thisdarkplace*blogspot*com,"Richley imagined and darkly humourous, In Yana is a wonderfully drawn world where humans are merely a small part of the food chain and a wizard is worth more for his skin then his knowledge. Highly recommended."
4,"Slightly small hooks, but overall great","Don't get fooled by the name, these are not heavy duty tie downs. You'll see those on big trucks and have cables that are about 3 inches across. These are nice, strong, light duty tie downs for people with a pickup truck. For those people,these things are excellent. I found the hooks to be a little small when I used them on the adjustable mount points on my Toyota Tacoma (which are, a little bit thick and hard to use), but when hooking them to the hard points, which are steel d-rings in the bed of the truck, they hooked right up nicely. The straps are good and strong. The ratchet mechanism was easy to use and adjust (unlike others I've used in the past). I'm really quite happy with these. I'd have given them all five stars if the hooks had been just a little bit bigger."
4,This sliding ratchet makes a difference,"I have similar product without a sliding ratchet. For me the sliding ratchet makes this product great. The J hooks are heavy-duty as is the strap. I took off a star because I don't care too much for the plastic handle. Nevertheless, this held my snow blower firmly in place during transport and I'm very satisfied."
4,Nice Ratchet hook,"I really like this ratchet hook. The hooks are strong and a good size. The ratchet mechanism is strong and easy to operate. Straps are typical nylon for ratcheting straps so nothing unexpected there. The bright color makes no difference to me but the grip is a nice touch. Overall, nice product."
3,Difficult to figure out,"I think the product is very sturdy. Before this I always used rope and bungee cords to secure things in my truck and I only need this for large objects.However, I did not receive any instructions at all and my trucker husband and auto mechanic friend both had difficulty figuring it out. Then when they did, they had forgotten it by the time they wanted to show me how to use it! Ratcheting is easy, securing is great, but the releasing leaves something to be desired. I don't think I would buy another one."
2,Author must have minored in English.,"This book takes the technology of 'readability' to new lows. The author clearly takes much pride in his extensive knowledge of the English language. I'm not saying you won't get useful information from this book, it's just such a painful process. We all had classes we enjoyed and those that put us to sleep. This is the class you had to bring coffee to. It's also an invaluable resource if you want to learn countless stringent guidelines for drawing an ER diagram."
4,F-Stop Blues,"Bruno Mertens ""cyberghandi"" the song you are after is F-Stop Blues. It is by Jack Johnson, and you will find it on his album Bushfire Fairytails. Great song. Great Album.Oh, and great film!"
1,Audio CD not the real music,"I loved the movie and the music, often ethnic African. Its the reason I bought this. But there is nothing in this CD like it. I didn't recognize a single movement, and I've seen the movie a dozen times. I expected the songs that played through the movie, like when Tobin plays the juke box in the opening or Sylvia's flute song... not the background music of when they are moving up a street, riding the scooter. its just background music. Do NOT waste your money on this."
4,jukebox selected song by Sean Penn,Great Film and also a great soundtrack...But I'm looking for who's singing the song that Sean Penn select after plug off the power chord of the jukebox machine...It seems that is the favourite song of his recently dead wife...Could anybody help me to find the title of that song and the artist that sing it?
4,Looking for a SONG if this movie that isn't in the soundtrac,Does anyone know the song played in the movie thats starts when sean penn y talkin' to nicole kidman and she goes to sleep with the phone (this sceane is before she gets in the bus that explotes)...PLEASE HELP!
3,It's ok...,It work just fine...The only issue I have with this item is that power AC is so expensive and so big that it look like a brick.
1,horrible,"Works for about an hour at a time, then shuts down. Tried it on another xbox and had the same issue, so its not my system."
3,BLACK AFTERMARKET UNIVERSAL POWER BRICK 203 WATT,DOES PUT OUT THE POWER BUT THE FAN IS A LITTLE LOUD WHEN POWERING AN OLDER 203WATT XBOX360 BUT NOT WHEN POWERING THE NEWER SLIM. NOT A BAD PRODUCT BUY IT IT WORKS JUST FINE.
3,Can't say; it was DOA,"As far as getting to me that was great!! I opened up the package and went to plug it in to try it and no power, tried another plug still no power. It is supposed to have a orange standby light when you just plug the power supply in. I had no lights and no power to my XBOX 360. Unfortunately the power supply was defective! I had no choice but to return for refund as it was the only one they had. Great delivery and service, but it is no ones fault that the power supply was No Good!"
1,power cord missing,"I bought this power adapter and it came missing the actual cord you plug into the wall. The adapter is useless without it. I had to purchase the power cord seperatelty and incurred more shipping charges. I'm sure some sellers actually include the power cord, so do shop around."
3,"Freakin' Loud, Expensive and Needs an Additional Plug","First of all, you will need a computer power cord or the original Xbox 360 cord to make this product work. Secondly, it is VERY LOUD. Louder than the 360 when you are playing games. I guess it is the internal cooling fan in this product, but it is so almost unacceptable.So far the product is working, but it is almost unbearable in volume.There really are few alternatives to this product, if you need a replacement or additional power supply brick for your Xbox 360. The $79.99 price on Amazon was cheaper than the $99.99 I have seen this product at places like Target."
1,Unreliable and ill manufactured,"After about 10 uses (of about 4 hours each), this power supply just stopped functionning. When it did, it was very hot (enough to peel the ends of its label) and never worked again, even when cool, days after. So about a month of very little useage rendered it unusable.Unlikely to buy another one again, it seems obvious that quality assurance is weak from this manufacturer. I don't recommend it."
3,Information from cover,"From the back cover :...a hostile, frozen planet overrun with warlords and revolution. The once-great dynasty of Starker IV has been destroyed, its rulers murdered in cold blood. But the rightful heir to the throne, Karne Halarek, is still alive -- and still fighting.Bodyguard to the young Lord Halarek, Egil has only one objective: his master's survival. The most honorable of warriors and steadfast of friends, Egil now faces his most impossible task. Because Halarek will do anything to reclaim hs kingdom... and his warlord enemies will do anything to kill him first."
5,A Road Not Often Taken,"I opened Barry Blood's book, ""Christian Dogma,"" hoping to find something beyond an emotional rehash of Christianity's core beliefs and their importance in our world today. Did I ever get a surprise!Blood writes from both his heart and his head. I do not know his professional background, but this book is compelling and well executed. If you are a practicing Christian, reading ""Christian Dogma"" will challenge you to think very hard about your religious beliefs and practices at a very fundamental level. If you are not a Christian, Blood's book provides real insight into modal Christian thinking.This is one of those rare books that will leave you much more aware and in touch with the religious convictions that you have taken for granted or perhaps have never really considered.Now I would like to see Blood write about our country's political practices!"
2,"Beautiful to look at, awful to play","There are some lovely graphics in this game, and I really wanted to like it, but it has some of the clunkiest controls I've ever encountered. Trying to move your character around is like staggering around drunk with a bad case of tunnel vision. This doesn't make the melee combat any easier. The slow loading times every time you go in and out of a building is annoying. Also very annoying, trying to position your character in the precise location that enables you to ""talk"" with an NPC. Playing this is about as much fun as being kicked in the head. After two days I gave up and returned to a game with better mechanics. Try the Star Wars Jedi Knights series for a more enjoyable Xbox RPG experience."
4,calendar,"The lay-out of the pocket calendar is user friendly; plenty of room to write on each day, with room for other memos. It looks good on the outside. However once you pick it up and feel the rigidity of it (it doesn't bend or conform unless forced), it loses it's appeal. My 2009 pocket calendar was a gift from my employer, with budget-cuts they did not provide them this year and I was searching for one like it.This year, at Thanksgiving I will begin looking at Wal-Mart for a 2011 pocket calendar. If you check the stores early enough, the have a better quality product than the Day_timer I purchased at amazon.com."
1,"Arrived intact, but all was already hard...","I received the package and it appeared to be intact...not crushed or anything. When I pierced the top, it was clear that the entire contents were hardened. must have been a pin hole in the tube or not sealed at the bottom. Not worth sending it back."
3,A jazzman's tale,"This is an interesting book at a number of levels. The autobiography of a successful American jazz player, its primary readership will probably be those who enjoy that branch of music. Certainly there is enough in it for them. But it is also a human story. Holladay doesn't just give an account of his career. He tells what it was like for a white man to become a jazz musician at a time when it was seen as largely a black preserve (at least as far as performing professionally went) and the prejudice he experienced from both sides. He tells of his time as a college music professor and why he returned to performing (an interesting sidelight on academia). And he tells of his spiritual quest and religious beliefs, his faith as a Baha'i (a religion he shares with the late, great Dizzy Gillespie) and how his convictions affect his work and life."
2,Broke!!,I am sorry mine broke almost inmediately while dropping the phone and was not able to repair.
2,Weak Entry in the O'Reilly Lineup,"I love O'Reilly books in general but this book has me asking what has happened there. This gotchas book is a weak entry in the O'Reilly lineup. Not so much from a technical point of view; overall the book is competent, but from a ""why do I want this book""? On the positive side the book is interesting because it presents some real arcane features of the CLR, but on the negative side there is very little practical value. Like any book, check it out first to see if you will find it useful --- I did not."
4,mixing languages?,"A nice, random access book on C# and VB.NET programming. You are expected to know the rudiments of at least one of these languages. It might be worthwhile to have this book around, as a possible quick time saver, if you're debugging.Looking over the gotchas, one sees how the ambitious scope of .NET has sometimes caused problems. In any given language, you know that certain names cannot be used for variables or classes, because they are reserved keywords. But .NET lets you mix source code from different languages. If you do this, the reserved keywords in C#, say, effectively expand to include keywords in those other languages. Something you never had to worry about before.Another gotch arises due to arrays. In C#, the array size is one more than the maximum allowed index. In VB, the array is made with that maximum value. Inconsistent.The book has other items that are more intricate. Some of these might be new to you."
1,Nothing Much New Here,"I work for a company who makes HR software and we are converting to .NET. I borrowed this book from my co-worker who recommended it. I saw very little in the book that I had not seen before in VS.NET documentation, it was just presented differently. I did like a few of the points about the differences bewteen VB and C# but that is not what I needed."
3,Technically Good but a Bit on the Dry Side,"I got this book as a gift. I'm not sure that I would have bought it myself. Pros: good technical information, one of the few books to give both VB.NET and C# versions. Cons: very dry writing style and the topics seemed disconnected somehow. So, I give it a 5 for technical and a 1 for writing, for an overall of 3.0. I think this is a book you'll like a lot or dislike a lot."
1,The Question is Why?,"I made the mistake of buying this book based on recommendations I had read here on amazon.com -- don't make the same mistake. If you are looking for practical techniques that will help you write .NET applications, this is NOT the book you want. Now this book is sort of interesting and points out weirdnesses of .NET but nothing that I hadn't seen online. So, check this book out first by browsing through a hard copy in a bookstore to see if it's what you want. I wish I had."
3,details on about 200 saints,"I bought this intending to look up some of those obscure saints who feature in the place-names of Cornwall- St Endellion etc- but had no luck as the introduction tells us that a complete hagiography runs to 12 volumes. This is nonetheless a useful and interesting little book with a page or two devoted to each featured saint, each with a 'headline' summing up their achievements: 'the bride of Christ', ''the apostle of Cumbria' etc. From Adalbert of Prague to Wilfrid and including occasional b/w illustrations. Printed on cheap, news-type paper"
3,It's okay.,"It has the largest listing of saints that I've seen in a book, BUT it has a lot of stupid errors in it, like typos... or just inaccuracies. For instance, in the entry for Bl. Margaret Pole, it says she tutored Henry VIII's daughter ""Anne,"" when he had no daughter named Anne. Pole was the confirmation sponser / godmother of Princess Mary. Annoying things like that make me give this book three stars. The text is kind of dry. It's a good place to start but cross-check everything you read in it with your own research."
3,Leaves me wanting much more,"Beautiful footage, just as you'd expect. But entirely too short. There's so much more to England than what was shown, even with the bonus footage. Also, I think that England in all 4 seasons would've made it even more interesting, visually. If you want a truly 5-star experience of the ""Visions"" DVDs, try the one of Greece. Much more to it than this one!"
3,Spectacular and yet...,"I enjoyed seeing targeted sites from a bird's eye view, but the narrator's script wasn't of the same quality as the spectacular visuals. As she bounced from place to place, it would have been helpful to see a map of England to know where a location was compared to the last one shown. My wife and daughter became bored with the narrator and left the room before the DVD finished. I agree with other reviewers' comments about the desirability of street level shots and scenes showing the changing seasons. I would add the following to that: Besides showing historical places, the DVD should have lived up to its name by capturing something of the English culture. England is more than buildings, waterways and fields."
1,Disheartening,"Avid Samantha Brown and Rick Steves' fans, our family thought we'd branch out and try other travel DVD's. We invested in VISIONS OF ENGLAND as well as several others from that series. After watching VISIONS OF ENGLAND three times, we almost returned to Amazon the others in the series without opening, so disheartening was the one on England. While the aerial shots are breathtaking and the music is lovely, the lack of narration meant our children and we learned almost nothing from the experience. The narration gave very little information on where the shots were taken and what we were viewing. If we could, we'd send it back for a refund. Invest instead in VISIONS OF ITALY (yes, we did go ahead and try another despite our disappointment in VISIONS OF ENGLAND)."
3,Bird's eye view of England.,This DVD gives you an helicopter view of the country from one end to the other. It is nicely done.
3,Over England,"This series is terrific, but this title is a tad disappointing considering the possibilities."
5,As an Oxford mathematician,"Lewis Carrol never forget about the child inside him. This publication is a replication of an old book in which many of his not-so-well-known articles are reprinted. You'll need a good background of who Carrol was (for example from the books by Morton N. Cohen (THE LETTERS OF LEWIS CARROLL: IN TWO VOLUMES) to appreciate was is printed here, but it is worth your while!"
3,Disappointing,"I really haven't heard a lot about this series other than the nice reviews you see here. With that said it was a slow book and not a lot of action...not that it needs a lot of action but if it doesn't it needs a lot of interesting side plots and originality but really this just wasn't interesting. I actually bought all 3 books certain that it would be really good so I will, at some point, finish the series but I'm not so eager to do so now. Let's hope the last couple books improve!"
5,One of my top 5 Fantasy novels,I first read this when I was thirteen and keep coming back to read it again and again. Just love the story and the rich characters. The author has a way of drawing you in that makes you keep turning the pages.
5,attractive + very illuminating,"This light gives a very bright light. Well sealed housing, I think it will hold up in the weather."
1,A Colossal Bore!,"Of the four major Beagle books I've read (""The New Beagle"" by Judith Musladin; ""Beagles"" by Beverly Pisano; and ""The Beagle: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet"" by Richard Roth) this one is clearly the worst. There is nothing of relevance to a pet owner in the ""real world"" - for someone who is looking for some common sense tips on how to care for and understand their pet. Chapters include such useless topics as@""Beagles in Hawaii,"" Hound Shows and National Beagle Club Recognized Packs,"" and ""Gun Dog Trials."" The countless dated black and white photos are all nearly identical - the usual champion's pose on the winner's podium - page after page of them. I don't think there's a photo taken after 1950 in the entire book. If you're just a regular pet owner who would like to learn more about where your Beagle is coming from and how to take the best, most practical care of it - read Richard Roth's book ""The Beagle: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet."""
2,NOT FOR THE REGULAR DOG OWNER,"I, too, was a little disappointed in this book. Although I loved the photographs of the beautiful little hounds, I was dismayed that the book contained nothing recent. The book was little more than a step-by-step manifesto on how you, too, can enter your beagle in a show and the issues concerning dog shows. I was disappointed that very little was offered in the way of the care of the hound and that the book was really directed towards showing the hounds as opposed to regular owners. Although information about showing beagles is all very well and good, I did not feel this work did a good job in presenting that information.I gave this an extra star because the photographs (although dated) of the hounds were very appealing."
5,Top-Quality reading for any Beagle lover!!!,"This is an excellent book for those who have loved beagles for years, and for those who are just finding out how great beagles can be! Here is a small testimony to the research involved with this book. Imagine our surprise when we found out that our female has a living legend for a great-grandfather!!! You would never know from just the Pedigrees from the American and Australian Kennel Clubs!!! It's a pleasure to see the authors make so much effort to produce very intelligent and informed material to the public."
2,Still need strength!,"I have another gadget that works great on jars that don't have a lip under the lid so I thought I'd try this for those jars (like Classico pasta sauce) that my little gadget doesn't work on...but you still need strength of a muscle man! Maybe I'm doing something wrong but even my husband tried it and said it was easier to just open it with his hands. The ""teeth"" on this opener just slip...very disappointed."
5,STRONG AS AN OX!,"This is the strongest jar opener I have ever owned. In fact, I had given up trying to find a satisfactory one because ALL I have purchased in the past have broken sooner rather than later.NOT THIS ONE! It is very impressive and sturdy. In fact, I would advise caution as it opens the jar with less work and pressure than one is expecting to have to apply to it. When using for the first time, I would recommend taking it easy. It really does all the work.The rubber base is also a plus so the jar does not slip around while it is being opened. And it fits into the opener easily for storage.The directions read that the base needs to be hand washed, while the opener itself is dishwasher safe. Both rinse so easily, however, that I don't see why it would be necessary at all to use a dishwasher for cleaning.With arthritic hands, this opener is a blessing for me which I have been searching for a long time to find."
5,Available online for free,"If you search using the title on Google Scholar, you can get this article for free."
4,Insightful,"This book allowed the reader a rare peek into the thoughts, opinions and emotions of a boy becoming a man in prison. The rage, the hormones, the injustice and the recklessness of the system and his childhood activities. His experience was valid while his words were eloquently laced with black liberation propoganda. The book is a bit mysterious in that there are letters to ""A friend,"" and a person referred to simply as ""Z."" I have read about George Jackson in accounts others have written about him and they paint him as a giant political figure, ironicaly in the same unrealistic way the prison industry did. This book reveals Mr. Jackson as a young man who struggled with the concepts of who he was, where he came from, how he got there and how he could revolutionize the thoughts of others as an example for change through his letters and his actions. This piece was an important reading. Hard to accept while easy to believe - insightful."
4,Speedy Service,Out of a large order this item arrived almost a week before the rest of the order. Good condition. Great price would definitely order from here again.
5,Great read!,I had this book 3x and everytime someone borrowed it and never brought back so I am holding this one for dear life!!!
3,Worthwhile but don't get carried away,"This collection of letters by Jackson is well worth reading for several reasons. First, as several other reviewers point out, it provides a valuable (if by now slightly dated) insight into the American penal system. Second, it illustrates the tragedy of people with Jackson's potential being diverted (whether you believe by racism, socio-economic circumstances, poor judgment, or whatever) into the self-perpetuating criminal/penal complex. However, I think some of the raves are overrated. Jackson clearly was an intelligent man who could have accomplished much if his engergies were otherwise directed. But he lacks perspective; the tone is often stridently self-justifying, and he lacks any real moral insight into the magnitude of the violence and pain he inflicted on others."
4,From a second story window,"This cd isnt appreciated very much by most people...i guess they cant handle the sheer intesity of this band...just because a band doesnt revolutionize the way people think about heavymetal, doesnt mean that they arent good...with pummeling riffs, breakdowns,and then the subtle changes into catchy melodic riffs make this CD quite a compelling buy...if you like vital remains, converge, the red chord, old underoath, or any grindcore/metalcore bands,from a second story window is for you...download ""how london got its fog""and see what this band is all about..."
3,Keeps water out,Pros:It works very well at keeping waterCons: As the LCD screen on this camera is not very big it can be hard to see when using this case in the water.It makes all the buttons hard to push.The flash filter must be used if you are using a flash otherwise the picture will not turn out.Overall it is a good water proof case however for the money I would rather buy a waterproof camera.
4,Almost perfect,"I've taken my small Canon on a couple of tropical vacations with this case, and it's still keeping the water out. It's really a sweet deal. I only docked a point for the max depth of 10ft and because the buttons don't always connect perfectly with the ones on the camera. Still, it's great for snorkeling."
5,"Pastor recommends ""Dangerous drugs""","""As a a pastor serving in a parish setting and as a family therapist, I have found Carol Falkowski's guidebook ""Dangerous Drugs,"" an excellent resource in my work with conflicted families. It is practical, down to earth, easily understandable and up-to-date, a great book for anyone working with crisis situations in today's pervasive drug culture. I highly recommend it and give it 5 stars!"""
1,irresponsible sham,"If you want to be lied to, read this book. If you are interested in facts, not sensationalism on GHB try ""GHB the natural mood enhancer"" by Morganthaler, Dean et al., available here. For the straight info on MDMA (ecstacy), read ""Ecstacy, the MDMA story"", by Bruce Eisner. For marijuana, start with ""The Emperor Wears no Clothes"", by Jack Herer. And for you intrepid psychonauts, Jonathan Ott's ""Pharmacotheon, entheogenic drugs, their plant sources and history"", is a masterpiece."
4,"Very nice, but HUGE!","When I got this item in the mail I was astonished at its size. It was HUGE! I was hoping that it would be able to hold my laptop, its cords and ONE of my college textbooks. However, I found that it could easily hold several textbooks in addition to purse contents and my laptop with cords. It is deceptively large. This is the reason I sent it back and gave it only 4 stars - it is TOO BIG. I am petite (5' tall) and this backpack just dwarfed me. It was still comfortable to carry though. Would recommend for purchase by people that want to carry the world on their shoulders. Faith :)"
1,Extremely poor analysis,"At least Bell's earlier books included some basic facts and events in the narrative. This book wanders from over generalizations to unsupported assertions and back to over-generalizations. It's is embarrassing to call this incoherent rambling an ""analysis"""
1,I wish I could give it 0 stars,"I recommend this CD to anyone who is having a hard day and needs a laugh. My roomate and I listen to this CD for that exact purpose, The playing is amateurish at best. It is a travesty that someone can make a recording just because they have the funds to make up for their lack of talent. This lack of talent is quite apparent in the pitch and tone. Real bassoonists do not sound like Daniel Smith."
4,A good product with an average mount,"The mount was too large for the handlebars, but an extra piece of foam tape was included. I added this to the one on the mount and it tightened down. Maybe this is an acceptable way to make it work, but it is not a good way. Even with the clamp fully tightened, the cage was still movable. With the weight of a water bottle I suspect it will move around when hitting bumps and rocks. Might be better for a road bike."
3,Doesn't fit all handlebars,"Purchased two of these for use on my kids bikes as their frames have no boss mounts for frame mounted cages as found on adult bikes. Fits my son's bike securely, however it does not fit my daughter's bike as her handlebars don't have a large enough diameter. Thus the cage slowly spins around once weighted with a full bottle which means the bottle constantly falls out. I've tried to sandwich in the extra foam they provide but even that doesn't snug it enough on her bike, thus the cage is basically useless.Note these cages are pretty large/long and could pose a hazard if you smash against your handlebars as the long back part of the cage will be pointing right at you, assuming you mount it to the handlebar as designed. Thankfully it's rounded, not pointed or squared."
4,Handlebar Water Bottle Cage,"I've wanted one of these for years. I've ridden on 3, 1,000 mile bike trips and kept kicking myself each time for not having one of these. I bought two and put one on each bike. So much easier to access as well as to have an extra water bottle available for the long hauls. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I thought it had typical water bottle mounting screws on the part that attaches to the handle bars which would have meant that if something happened to the cage I could simply replace it with another cage which would have been REALLY nice. But it's a solid weld, so if the cage breaks the whole thing is trash. But for the price it's still a reasonable purchase."
2,51man,Just got it today. I was exited to mount it on. The bracket that holds the cage to the handlebars is not sturdy enough. Bought three cages for my wife and two sons two years ago. The brackets on all three are very sturdy. I believe They were sold by another vendor thru Amazon and did cost $ 7.00 a piece. This is cheaply made it's not worth buying it. To return it may cost more than it is worth. I guess I will trash it.
4,good,it fits nice and doesnt move. just wish it was adjustable for different cup sizes. You pretty much need to buy a few cups to figure out which one fits snug enough that it doesnt fall out.
4,not quite fit,"It did not quite fit my bike model ""Flirt"". I have to install it on the handlebar sideway instead, but I guess it's more of the problem with the size of handle on my bike compared to others. otherwise, it's a great buy with reasonable price."
5,Perfect!,"I just needed a simple water bottle basket for my 3speed cruiser. This worked out perfectly. I have no idea why I waited so long to get one, especially since it was so inexpensive. I was not able to find anything this simple in the sporting good store. Even though I'm a weak armed woman, I was able to mount this by myself - with the right metric allen wrench that was NOT included."
4,Bought as a gift,I have always liked .Corelle; bought this in red for my weekend cabin. My daughter wanted simple black so I got her this to add to her set. Disappointed that not all dishes come in this pattern; some had to be bought in plain white.
1,Total crap!,"This movie , if you want to be generous and call it a movie, was made by, and for ADD kids. No ideas, no story, no plot, not funny, no nudity. If you cant pull off a parody B-movie, rethink your choices in the entertainment industry. Just sayin."
3,"Not Bad, but Still....","Three reviewers have been here before me, and my reaction to this disc lies somewhere between that of Santa Fe Listener and the other two, though probably closer to the former. The Second Symphony is a pleasant if unremarkable work; I've heard it more often as part of a full symphonic cycle set conducted by Jean Martinon, where it easily gets lost among three other similar sounding siblings, with the Organ Symphony as distinctive odd man out. Standing alone on this disc, it gets a decent treatment by Butt and the London Symphony. Phaeton is played well also, though I confess the piece itself doesn't interest me. On the other hand, I must admit to at least a little affection for Suite Algerienne, principally because of its restrained but still stirring last movement military march. My final verdict is that the contents of this disc are okay, but I suspect that a quick trip to YouTube will be enough to satisfy my occasional future urges for that Marche Militaire."
5,A Life In Cinema,"This is a brilliantly written book about remarkable and eccentric character in the Indian films. Guru Dutt was a complex man but a simple soul who was always unhappy with his life. Unlike other filmmakers, Guru Dutt did not copy western filmmakers. You can read this book many times and still not figure out what Guru Dutt wanted in life or what type of person is he. Does any one know what they want in life? Many of his colleagues become emotionally attached to him. That was his legacy."
4,icy blue,this guitar dosent just look cool it plays great if you are a begineer you will do great with this guitar but you should replace the strings and strap
4,awesome product,"This ex-pat misses many treats from my home country, Canada, but I certainly don't appreciate the cost mark-up... excellent tasting candy bars though."
4,Quality Sheath,"Very quality sheath, although I'm not sure how the sharpener is supposed to work since it isn't positioned right. Overall a very nice sheath. Would buy again!"
4,Not too bad,"I bought this sheath to protect my machete and myself from the machete. For the price I consider this to be a good product. I can't comment on the self sharpening feature because I don't know how well that really works. I feel like this sheath would last much longer than any fabric (nylon) products. The black latch at the top doesn't really offer any sort of lock for my machete, but may work for others which have a different handle/blade. The belt clip is a nice touch but I wish it was a closed bar so you can feed any belts through. Instead I have some fabric belts that I like to wear normally which cant really support the weight of this sheath + machete since it's not a complete loop.The only thing I would truly change about this sheath would be to add some sort of loop that I could attach a strap to so this can be thrown over my shoulder. I'm not sure what others are looking for with sheaths but I feel this does a good job of holding my machete which even has a saw blade on its top."
4,Should have looked a little harder...,"For those who do not know, the (Ontario) military issue 18"" machete does NOT come with a sheath. It is also a huge pain in the rear to sharpen, so if you don't have a bench stone, don't waste your time. I purchased the rothco sheath trusting in the company for some other items I have purchased,from the same company, that I love. This is a great sheath if you are going to strap it to your bug-out bag and get on with it, but there is no clear way to fix it to your leg or waist. If you intend to hike and have easy access to your machete, this is not the sheath for you. PS if you CAN get the Ontario machete sharp?? Look out, cause that's one bad motha..."
5,good product,This is a good product. You need a dremel tool to g rind off the rivit that holds the belt loop because it will scratch off the powder coat off a good machete. And grind off the rivit that holds the knife sharpener too. Throw both of these things in the trash after removal. But for the money its a great sheath.
4,Zip Ties,"This is a good sheath, but is designed to be used with a military type gun belt. If you want to use it with a regular belt then you'll need to ""rig"" it. The easiest way is to use a heavy duty zip tie as a belt loop. Just loop it through the metal bracket and cut it to the length you need. Done. I have been extremely disappointed in the quality of sheaths provided with virtually every machete I have ever bought -- and I've bought a bunch of them (I've been a land surveyor for 30 years.) After-market sheaths are no better. This one looks promising for a change. It has held up well so far. I only wish they made one longer."
1,Unreliable clasp.,"I used this sheath for several months, every day. I did the same as Pepelepiu (see other review) in that I cut the military webbing clip off and made a belt loop of paracord for it. It does not attach to a belt, as it comes. I loved the sheath while I had it, then I lost the machete due to the swivel pin pulling free from the sheath. A sheath that causes you to lose the machete is a horrible sheath, to say the least. I would advise not buying this sheath if you intend to carry the blade daily, the clasp will not stand up to the wear of walking off the beaten path..."
5,"I Love it. It fits an 18"" Ontario Machete Perfect!","I bought the 18"" Ontario Machete off Amazon. Did not come with a sheath so I had to find one. Thanks to reviews like this one I bought this sheath and it fits my 18"" Ontario Machete perfectly. Has the old GI Style connector hook that fits on the old style green duty belt. I love it! Fits tight that it won't fall out but easy to draw! The sharpener isn't the best but it gets the job done!"
4,Get it if you can find it,"This deck is becoming increasingly hard to find in the States. You never were assured of walking into a local shop and finding it crowded behind the Dragon or Crowley deck, but sometimes you could get lucky; but even that's not the case anymore. I really can't comment about the masculine appeal of this deck (refer to previous review) other than that I'm male and this is the deck I'm most comfortable reading with. Now I just wish they'd make the companion book available to us Yanks."
4,Very helpful,"I bought this book to use to teach myself fundamentals of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry becuase I had not taken them as an undergraduate student and needed to know the fundamentals for post-graduate work. I have found this text very helpful and relatively easy to follow as for as text books go. The progression of lessons from section to section is excellent. It is a lot of information jammed into one text, but done well."
3,Basic O-chem book,"This book gets the job done for a basic introduction to organic chemistry and biochemistry. It is not very in depth, but is designed for an entry level course, so what do you expect."
1,Poor editing,People that are rating this book high must not have read it. I am only on the third chapter and already there are three mathematical errors in chapter 3 alone and not to mention all the other mispellings and erroneous information. Someone dropped the ball on this 7th edition. Hopefully they wont make an 8th until I can sell this one cuz I dont want to keep it.
2,It's a useful encyclopedia of atheistic philosophical errors,"Michael Martin's book is very useful as an encyclopedic catalog of atheistic arguments (positive and negative) against the existence of God. However, contra the gentleman from Germany, most of Granger's points are salient and true. Martin completely misunderstands the Kalam Cosmological Argument, primarily by confusing labeling and enumeration (!), and his attempt to revive the hopelessly falsified Verification Principle as a special-pleading stick to beat religion with does no credit to his intellectual honesty. If I were compelled to recommend the best atheistic treatment of the philosophy of religion, it would still be Mackie's MIRACLE OF THEISM."
2,Atheism A Philosophical Justification,Michael Martin goes out of his way to disprove and refute the criticisms of atheism but one thing he hasn't done is disprove or refute the archaeological and historical evidences for the Holy Bible and Tanach.
3,A GREAT VIEW OF THE OLD AND NEW WEST.,"With 124 photographs. Out of the soil of Texas, in the middle of the 19th century, sprang a wholly new kind of American-the tough, resourceful, self-reliant cowboy. In this handsome book Patricia Lauuber traces the evolution of the cattle industry and the changing role of the men who work in it. A lavish selection of illustrations documents every phase of the cattlemen's life-from the days of the vaquero to todays' scientific cattle breeder."
2,Not as practical as hoped,"While this item works okay, it's just barely okay. It requires a lot of arm pressure to get any amount of grated cheese, and I am not sure we'll use it again after we've used up the cheese blocks currently in it. True, I could just buy pre-grated, but with the starch they put in the pre-grated stuff to keep it from sticking together, it really adds too many extra carbs to your diet, so I was looking for an alternative.After trying them side by side, I like my salad shooter a lot better for grating cheese."
2,not the best grater,"But you don't have to take my word for it. Actually there are lots of reviews (well, 16) of this exact product on Amazon. I wonder if they started a new page becuase of them. [...]Not sure if you can see that link. In any case, the point is that people found it very difficult to grate or to get much volume out of. Those who were able to grate it, with brute force, then tended to crack or break it. Just not the best design out there. Get a rotary grater if you would like that sort of help grating."
4,Mine broke too. Good for table :),"OK, I gotta a '2 for one' at a home show. Gave one to my daughter. After a couple years of use and that did take some forceful churning....the white center broke off bottom, where pin inserts. I could not use this for volume anyway, but I liked it for table use. If someone wants a little more cheese, ""grate your own"". I don't like pre-grated cheese--even grated at home. Like it fresh grated--Italian, I am!! Just last week, I talked my daughter out of hers, as she, like so many others, did not like it or hardly ever use it. Like I said, ONLY for table use. Otherwise, I'd give it one star for volume use."
1,Disappointing,"It took me a couple months to even get the game to play without crashing. I eventually found a combination of the newest video drivers, the game patch, and a tweak in the nVidia display panel to get this one going. The game itself is boring and doesn't develop much story line. I played it once and that was enough."
2,The '90's called .. they want their graphics back,"I picked this up for under $10, that is the only positive part of the experience. The graphics are reminiscent of the old DOOM or QUAKE game from days gone by. This would have been a cool and cutting-edge game 10-15 years ago. I expect a lot more from my games now, and this simply fails to deliver. Weapons are horrible and inaccurate. Vehicles are next to impossible to control, and underwhelming at best, once you get the hang of it. It's pretty cheap ... for a good reason."
3,Don't be fooled by the reviews on the box!,"This game is mediocre at best. The sory is incomprehensible, the weapons are boring, the level design is uninspiring and the game is just another 1st person clone.The multiplayer is OK but its not much fun since there aren;t many servers to play on.Don't pay anything more than $10 for this (new)."
3,Ehhhh,"I have no idea how this game won E3 2004. It's a halo wannabe. The storyline is corny, the graphics not that great. It's something about some girl with a virus who is, pardon my french, a total b****. She runs off all the time and pops up again somewhere else."
1,PARIAH,"The lack of ability to save this game even when you want to take a break is totally absent. As far as I can tell you have to play this game all the way through at one setting in order to finish it. This makes the game totally unplayable, you end up replaying scenarios at least a half dozen times just to get back to where you were, DO NOT waste your money on this game."
1,Forty Dollars I'll Never Get back,"Hungering for a FPS to fill the HL2/Doom 3 void, I made the mistake of buying this game. Instantly struck by mediocre voice acting and cliche writing, I thought other aspects might be better... but I was wrong.Game play isn't horribly awful until you engage vehicles or shoot from them. The weapon upgrade system fairly interesting, but it's not enough to float a game of filled with lead weights.Worst of all is the checkpoint only save system. They even force you to sit through the cut scenes every time you get sent back. The game might be survivable if you were able to rapid fire quicksave... but you can't.Save your time, save your money, run away!"
3,another groove game fps,This is another budget shooter from groove games its actually one of the better games as far as graphics and length of play but it suffers from various glitches and i still would not pay more than 5 bucks for this- buy it used if you can
1,"Not much to say - old premises, new box and price","I won't waste too much time typing what the other reviews before me have covered.Suffice it to say -Nothing new or exciting. Some nice graphics, but linear gameplay and so-so game AI.Lots of hype here but nothing you have not played before. Save your money for GTA: San Andreas for PC(coming June 7th) and Call of Duty 2 and the other great games coming to pc this summer and fall."
2,Over-hyped game,"After reading the reviews on Amazon and other sites, I decided to try Pariah. Boy, was I duped! This is the most boring and needlessly incomprehensible game I've played in a long time. At least with other games like Halo and Far Cry, you have some idea of why you are doing what you are doing in the game. Pariah leaves you wondering (1) what is my motivation, other than just trying to survive, and (2) why am I playing this game in the first place. Just like Black, it is nice graphics-wise, but really not worth the effort or trouble required."
2,Lack of Saves sinks this game,"The graphics are gorgeous, the levels are interesting (though at times needlessly and over-the-top deadly), and the concept of weapon enhancements is great. But the fact that you cannot save this game before (or in the middle of) difficult sections makes it so frustrating as to be unplayable. Even the $10 I spent on it seems too much given that there's no way I'm going to waste my time trying over and over again to get past the third level. Save your money and buy a game that's more fun than frustrating no matter how cool the graphics look."
1,"Crashes every time, no customer support","Pariah crashes every time I start it. The bug report tool sent an email to an address that bounced. I patched it with the latest patch and it still crashes every time. This is probably the 10th game I've installed on my current computer and the only one I've had any problems with.EDITED TO ADD:So, I got this working. It doesn't run on dual core processors, so you need to google ""processor affinity"" and set it run on only one processor. Also I had to turn off full screen transform and lighting because it would turn my whole screen black every time a grenade went off. It's still a lame game. The incredibly stupid enemies stand up behind crouch cover while reloading. The levels are totally linear, you go, you shoot, repeat. Boring."
3,Pariah,"This is a FPS-a shooter. Some have stated this game isnt anything special. Well maybe it isnt the ""best shooter of all time"" but all games cant be the best. What is this game then ? Its a shooter thats fun and exciting,kind of futuristic like ""Unreal II"" . If you like shooters then this one is worth a try."
1,"Good idea, lackluster presentation","Don't be drawn in by the fancy-looking box with the beautifully rendered lady on the inside cover. The graphics in-game were only marginal when I first set to out to play this, so I went to turn them up, only to find them on high and very high. I told myself to just work through it, but any hope of that was shattered by the hideous repetition of the single player mode. The weapons in Pariah are ridiculous. I can't seem to find one that's suited for any situatuion. The main weapon, the Bulldog, is somewhat accurate, and that's stretching it. The only accurate weapon in the game is the sniper rifle (I'm assuming. I can't bring myself to play any further). Most of the weapons won't work if you're more than 5 feet away. I'm not even going to bother with multiplayer because I can't see it being worth my while. Do yourself a favor and get something else."
5,An excellent one-year devotional,"In a day when ""devotional"" has come to mean lovely thoughts bearing little relationship to the biblical passage, this book challenges, encourages, and draws the reader into the text. Based on Robert Murray McCheyne's one-year reading plan, Carson brings to life one of the four passages read each day. I can't wait to get vol. 2,"
5,Great Bible in a year study guide,Great Bible in a year study guide along with it's companion volume 2. Carson is a wonderful theologian with a great desire to see us all be in the Word of God.
5,Wonderful Book,I have enjoyed the messages from this book. I wanted a way to undestand the Bible better. I have purchased additonal copies for friends. At the end of the year you have reviewed the whole Bible. Great! Great!
4,For the Love of God,This book is very helpful when reading scripture. It helps in relating important details to each other and gives the reader a broader scope in understanding. Also it provides an organized guide to be able to read the entire scripture in one-year's time.
5,For the Love of God is fantastic!,"I'm enjoying the Carson devotional immensely. It has really dragged me back into the Word, which is what I needed. It's amazing how spiritually complacent a person can get with just reading bits here and there, without an organized plan such as that! This is just what I've needed."
1,Not as advertised,"This is not a business card Rolodex. It is just a standard Rolodex. I returned the first one I got thinking Amazon had sent the wrong item (a first for me). When I received exactly the same thing as a replacement, I read the reviews (something I frankly never do) and discovered that others found out before me that this is not a business card Rolodex."
5,"The best 'Exotic Dancer Pasties"" I've ever found!","Being a dancer in a topless club that requires us to wear pasties over our areolas, these have worked the best! They stay on even when sweaty, (as long as you don't use lotion on the area where your sticking them) They blend in with your skin tone but aren't see thru, and they are nice and soft!If you're a dancer you know how weird the beige pasties look on dark skin ladies so the cocoa ones work perfect!I am thoroughly satisfied with this product.Thank you!"
1,Doesn't fit big breasts,"I'm a Dcup and these not only didn't fit properly on my breasts, they're difficult to put on, and made my breasts look ridiculous. Probably works best with smaller breasts."
4,works!,These definitely take practice to apply without leaving wrinkles. We had to cut this to size so nothing peeks out. Got lucky as it worked the first time!
2,paper thin,"The adhesive worked well on the bra without irritating the skin; however, there was minimal support and coverage. The ""bra"" was paper thin."
4,It made my night,"I purchased this item for my birthday dress. I couldn't wear a regular bra because the straps would of showed. And i couldn't wear a strapless bra because the dress had an opening in the back. My boobies are fairly big and i was surprised that it fit the way it did. It stayed on all night didn't have a problem with then coming off, they basically stayed on until the next morning after the heat and sweat of clubbing. The only problem i had with them was taking them off.....oh brother, all i have to say use baby oil for the sensitive part lol."
4,Worked pretty good.,I am pretty busty 36 DD and they worked pretty good. They were a little hard to get on but once on it held in place and I was happy with them. I will purchase again.
1,Did not work at all,"I was hoping this would work for a low, V-neck wedding dress and they did not at all. I am a b cup so size should not have been an issue. Very disappointed."
2,strapless bra,"These did not work for me at all, this is the worst product i have ever purchased from Amazon actually total waste of money, I am a 36DD and I ended up going braless at the Marine Corp Ball. that was a better option than using this product. totally useless."
1,Did not work,This product did not live up to expectations. I was disappointed with the product and with the reviews online which were the reason why I selected Braza.
3,tried to kill white flies,Tried this product to kill white flies in our greenhouse. Our greenhouse is 10x22 and is in our back yard. It killed a lot of them but not all of them and for a bug bomb for $20 it should of killed all of them. Going to try something else. I know white flies are hard to kill but this product is made for it and our greenhouse is smaller what the product is made for.
5,Slightly Glitsy and Pretty Pendant,"I own many of these glass pendants now and love them all, but I think this is my favorite because it has a bit of glitz to it. I get many compliments, and no one can believe the low cost."
2,Not sturdy,Not Sturdy unless you screw it in to the wall.Putting one ream of paper on either top shelves causes whole rack to lean.May be OK for a few papers on each shelf but nothing more unless you fasten the shelf to something.
2,Durable construction that holds up to less than one day,"Length:: 0:14 MinsWell, it broke on the way here so it can't be that strong (seemed like it was well packed)."
5,Used it for large puzzle storage,I needed a solution that would fit my toddler's large puzzles... the Melissa and Doug ones didn't work (even though most of the puzzles were made by Melissa & Doug) and so I thought I'd give this a try. It works great!
4,She's not Myers but she's good,"This album is delightful. Because Myers is superior to Johnson, I ordered his album with the Saint-Saens Sonata for Clarinette and piano. Unfortunately the rest of the album was not nearly as good as the Emma Johnson one. This album is delightful and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
3,Unique Product,"As stated in the title, a very unique product. I purchased it without reading the only review, attracted by the ""metal"" aspect. Sure enough I viewed the first review after receiving the product, and he's absolutely right.The screen is blocked by a ""Plexiglas"" screen. Therefore the only thing you can do with the device is look at it, and admire it. Otherwise the construction quality, materials, and fell are all very good.Solution to the screen issue- as long as you're comfortable with voiding your warranty, just remove the screen and replace the felt lining. Works for me, now I'm completely satisfied."
3,May or may not be worth your while,"It is a bit larger than I expected it to be ((10x12x3"") but can be useful to tote around accessories (cables, dash mount, recharger, etc). You could get a cosmetic or toiletries case at Target for a lot less that would do the same."
3,"Nice, But Generic","Very nicely constructed -- durable and light. However, if you're looking for something that has pre-formed foam placements for your Magellan GPS, you won't find it here. The case comes with two oblong foam inserts that come close to fitting the Roadmate form factor, but obviously were not made with that intent. There are also velcro straps that you can use to secure the foam inserts. To make this fit my Roadmate 2200, I had to add additional foam inserts and cut out sections of the supplied inserts."
3,case gps,Not the expected case w/dividers. Nothing special that I could not find in my local DVD or CD carring case department store. I felt it was overpriced for what i recieved. Guess i'll keep it and say lesson learned.
4,GPS Carrying Case,A very useful product. It allows me to have all of my GPS accessories organizedin one convenient padded case so I can just grab it and go. It would be helpful ifif it were a little larger to hold more items.
4,Great case for your Magellan GPS,"This case is large enough to hold the GPS unit, power supplies and mounting bracket. My only complaint is that it came with two large styrofoam inserts that appear to be used for the GPS unit! One is all that is needed and the other can be discarded since it will not fit into the pouch with the other parts. The case is sturdy and has an adequate zipper that should not fail under normal use."
4,Roadmate Carrying Case,Quit a handy way to keep all the stuff that goes with my Magellan GPS together. The padding is enough and trhe compartments are configurable.
2,2 units defective from different sources,"I ordered 2 units. Amazon only had 1 unit so the second was from one of the external vendors fulfilled by Amazon. Nice looking but both units were defective. On each, the front left joint had not been glued. I surmise that both must have come from the same manufacturing run where some glue machine had not been refilled. So be careful. Amazon prime provided easy return and refund."
2,"not a good quality, scratches everywhere","I'm disappointed after I got it. not a good quality, scratches everywhere. Very light. Not as solid as we see from the picture."
3,Nice Tray...,This letter tray is nice but unfortunately it is not the right color. Once it arrived it was lighter than it appeared in the picture.
5,Excellent Tray,"Highly recommended to anyone looking for an elegant tray to place on their counter top. It's really that simple. Well constructed, looks great, and effective. Non-slip feet help it say in place."
2,Cheap,"Cheap product. Lightweight, cheap boxwood, uneven finish inside the tray, cheaply glued. Literally fell apart during shipping and arrived in pieces; (the box was completely undamaged). Lighter in color than it appears in the pictures. Dollar store quality."
2,Wait For Something Better,"It's clumsy and, more often than not, just plain wrong. I bought this primarily for a friend who is, in many respects, very much a beginner guitarist. I spend an inordinate amount of time editing the mistakes the software makes. I would not recommend this product to a beginner. An experienced player would not need the software because their ear would serve them better than the program. However, an intermediate player might find the product useful, especially the feature which slows down the song without changing the original key to the song. Good for practicing solos. But I understand there are other products that also have that capability. If you ignore all of the ""noise"" and by ""noise"" I mean unnecessary chord changes that the program picks up from other instruments or vocals, it will tell you the key of the song and (usually) the basic chord structure of the song. After that you're on your own."
2,Don't expect any customer support...,"If you are looking for a ""chord finder"" software, then this is about the best you're going to get. Unfortunately, there isn't much out there that works. This software gives you an idea of what chords go where, but don't bet your house they will be right. This software DID NOT work on Vista. I tried several times to get it to work, but it never did. Don't buy it if you're wanting to use it on Vista! It works OK on WinXP, but there are still little things that aren't reliable...like the chords. I tried on several occasions to contact the ""customer support"", but I don't believe there is such a department. I never heard back from them a single time. As I said, it is about the best out there. It did help me to get close to what chords went where. Hopefully, in the near future, there will be a ""chord finder"" software that actually works."
2,Sienzo Cusotmer Service = 0,"I've been using Sienzo Digital Music Mentor for a couple of years and it works to get the general feeling for the chord changes of a song. I find the chords aren't always exactly right and they throw chords in where they don't have to, but the worst part about this software is Sienzo's customer service if you need help. THERE ISN'T ANY!If you need help like I did a few times, you might as well talk to the wall because nobody ever returns your emails. Once they've made the sale, you no longer matter ... you simply don't exist any more in their eyes."
5,The best book I ever read.,"This is an excellent book. It made me cry for a really long time. It just goes to show you that love binds two people together like nothing else. I keep re-reading this book, and every time I still cry even though I know what happens in the end."
4,A must read book,I have read a ton of Lurlene McDaniel book and this is my favorite. She is such a good author. The people in the story really touched me.I wasent so happy with the ending though. But i don't want to spoil the ending for you.
5,A page turner....,"I barowed this book from a friend and I thought it was just going to be a nother dumb ""fary tale"" but it wasn't it was actualy a really touching book. It was so good that I finshed in a day, I sugest to everyone (mostly girls) to read this book& if you allready have you rock !!!!"
5,None,I was walking around my school library looking for a good romance book to read. I picked up this one and never wanted to put it down! It brought tears to my eyes!!!!!! Totally worth the read!
5,Just as good as I remember!,"I was recently reintroduced to the Lurlene McDaniel books by my young niece. I'm 22 years old now but as a teenager I adored her books. And you know what? They're just as good now as they were then! I read this book and became totally ingrossed in the story. It all ended far too soon. And yes, the ending made a tear come to my eye. Lurlene's books have a way of tucking at your heart and making you cry. They teach you about life and love and friendship as well as adversity, courage and triumph. Read this book - you won't regret it"
5,An Incredible Love Story That Will Definantley Make You Cry,"This book was great! The whole plot was great, the characters were great... just a great love story that makes you see that you will fall in love with a person for who they are, not what they are. I would definantley recommend this book to anyone who likes sappy love stories. Every woman in their right mind needs a good cry from time to time and this book will definantley do that to you. The story of Mark and April is one in a million, and the expressions of love, sadness, scare, and mad are all part of this book."
2,VERY DISPLEASED,"The zoom is a great feature but doesn't make up for the HORRIBLE Audio and HORRIBLE video in low light. When I contacted Panasonic, basically the bottom line was too bad."
1,I bought 30...17 are broken...,I bought 30 of these headphones for a keyboard class in a high school...17 of them are already broken in less than 6 months. Do not waste your money. I now have to purchase a whole new set...and they will not be Coby.
2,BAD SOUNDING HEADPHONES,I BOUT DESE FO $6. FO DAT PRIZ THEY COUD B MUCH BETA. DAY DO FIT WELL BUT DAY HAV NO TREBLE DOG. VERY BAD SOUND. ID GET SOMTHIN A BIT MO EXPENSIVE.
2,No More Starmate For Me,"This was my second Starmate - the first was the Starmate 2. The 2 had much better reception; I noticed immediately with the 4 that my reception was not consistent, sometimes I couldn't pick up reception at all, even though I was driving in the same areas as before. Also, neither one of these units lasted very long - they both only last about 18-24 months before they completely died. I won't be getting this unit again - extremely disappointed in how long the unit lasts."
4,"Product fine, seller...not so much","I wanted to return this product to the dealer, which wasn't directly Amazon.com. Dealer never responded to my emails about the return."
5,Sirius Starmate - great product,The product arrived on time and brand new. The price was very good and it has operated very well as expected. I chose this specific model to match the docking in a few other cars so I was limited in what I wanted but I am very happy with it and it's performance.
2,Disappointed,"I bought the Starmate 4 to repalce an older, larger unit. I had heard that the FM transmitter on the newer Starmates and Sportsters were useless (and that turned out to be true), but that didn't really matter to me because I hook it up directly to my car stereo via an aux input. However, I noticed right away after setup that the fidelity from the Starmate 4 wasn't as good-- it sounded tinny and lacking in bass. Thinking it was just my imagination, I then compared the sound from the Starmate 4, alternating with my car's FM radio and CD player, and then with my older Sirius unit-- and the Starmate 4 sounded lousy compared to all of them. Almost like an old transistor radio in comparison. Don't know about the new Sportster 4, so I am going back to an original Sportser or Replay, which on second thought isn't a whole lot bulkier."
1,Sirius problems,"Are you kidding me? Nothing but static! Sirius claims to have CD quality??? I get better sound from regular FM stations. I had to return the Starmate 4 after becoming completed aggravated with all of the static and interference from the wireless connection. If you don't ""direct connect"" the Starmate 4, you are wasting your time. I am amazed that Sirius is even selling these inferior products. I was on hold with Sirius for 32 minutes today, trying to cancel my subscription. I was told that I wasn't the only one doing so."
2,Shoddy Product,"I really enjoy satellite radio and the Starmate worked fairly reliably for the first year. It would occasionally lose its connection with the satellite antenna and display the ""not connected"" alert. Over time, the connection became more and more intermittent to the point of being unusable. For $100, I guess I didn't expect it to wear out so fast."
4,Radio transmiter needs to be stronger,I love Sirius but I'm not 100% happy with this product. The Starmate suffers from the same issues as all the newer Sirius products. They had to turn down the power of their FM transmitter to comply with FCC regulations. The problem is that now unless you have the Sirius unit connected to your radio; your radio will pick up interference from older units that pass you on the highway. The older units were so powerful that I could pick up the Sirius signal in my house from my car parked out side. The new units are not powerful. Sirius has tried to compensate for the weaker signal by providing an antenna that can be feed into your radio. The problem is this makes the unit permanent to your car. I switch cars a lot and so I don't have the unit mounted in my car. Unless the unit is on top of the radio it will not work. Plus when ever I'm in traffic my unit is over powered by all the other satellite radios around me.
3,sweet stories,"I read most of these stories when I was in high school. I bought them for my daughter. It is hard to find sweet romantic stories that aren't full of vampires, werewolves, and other ""monsters"" and/or full of sex. My daughter is enjoying this books."
2,Not the colour pictured,"If you are trying to match the Rolodex Wood Tones Mahogany set - this does NOT match. The wood looks a bit cheap, not very shiny and has a few marks."
1,Not the color pictured,"To anyone who is trying to match this to the Rolodex Wood Tones Mahogany set - this does NOT match! It is a more yellowish brown color, not mahogany at all, and does not look like the picture at all."
4,It works. Its cheap.,"It works, and it is cheap. It is very lightweight, not too high quality, but better looking than the plastic ones. what more can you ask for for 5 bucks"
4,Look great.,"I have the post it holder, the desk trays, and pencil holders. These look great on my desk. Very happy with purchase. Better prices than retail stores."
3,Nice product,This product does what it needs to holds my business cards! The only thing that I can say is that the color doesnt match my desk as I thought it would.
4,It's wonderful to have Doc Adams back after three years,"I've read all of the books in Rick Boyer's Doc Adams series beginning with the wonderful Edgar Award winning ""Billingsgate Shoal"". If you like a good mystery/action story this is an excellent series for you. ""The Man Who Whispered"" is also filled with excellent references to good food and wine as well as Cape Cod lore. This book stands alone as a good introduction to the Doc Adams series but it is even more enjoyable if you've read Boyer's other Doc Adams books in order."
4,Does language allow us to explain what we percieve? Or-...,"Does language interfere with how much of the universe we see/hear/feel? The hoary 'universal translator' (i.e. most authors wouldn't have had a story without this machine..) is finally replaced with a workable system. If you want someone to speak like a native, then they have to grow up speaking the language. The wonder of the ideas expressed are a perfect complement to Janet Kagan's HELLSPARK and Jack Vance's LANGUAGES OF PAO. It's almost unfortunate that the (wonderfull) feminist storyline overshadows some of the other ideas. Still, anyone who would ignore someone's real ability, because 'man was created to be in charge' deserves whatever happens to him. (Yes, I am male.)"
3,Not that Impressed,The tank is too small especially if you have pets (hair). I spend all my time empting the tank. I also picks up odor after a few uses and smells like feet. It does a fair job of cleaning beyond the previous mentioned.
3,Meh.,"The vacuum is good for picking up crumbs, but not very good for picking up pet hair...it pushes it into clumps, which I then have to go over with the attachment hose.The attachment hose works well, the turbo brush comes in handy. However, the hose is quite short (even with the extender) and the turbo brush itself is a pain to snap back into place. I have to keep the setting on bare floor with my carpet just to get suction, and my carpet isn't even that thick! I honestly would not recommend this to someone unless they're entire home was hard wood flooring."
1,Pet Owners Beware!!!,"This vacuum is not too bad for the money...but you get what you pay for!!! You want to spend under a $100 for a vacuum? This might not be a bad choice but just keep it mind...you get what you pay for!!!I have a dog that sheds and after several months of using this vacuum, it gets clogged after EVERY single use. I have to take apart three different sections of this vacuum just to get the suction power to a moderate level. It became such a pain in my arse that I broke down and bought a Dyson DC25 Animal....Man, I got what I paid for!!! Worth every penny!!!If you own pets that shed, DO NOT BUY THIS BISSELL VACUUM CLEANER!!!You WILL regret it!!!You own a pet that sheds?Pony up the $450 and by the Dyson DC25 Animal!!! You WON'T regret it!!!"
2,Died after a year and a half,"Loved this vacuum for the first three months, then I was constantly washing/changing filters (and the HEPA filter can't be washed, you have to buy a new one every time). The suction stopped completely one day, so we tried to fix it following the instruction manual. Good luck with that! Nothing worked the way it was supposed to, so we've finally given up and will be purchasing a new vacuum - but not a Bissell."
3,not sure,"i pulled mine out of the garbage. It looked nearly new, so I figured I'd plug it in and check it out. First I cleaned out the lower smaller tube behing the brush on the rear of the vacuum, leading up. There was like cemented kitty litter there. This led to another large clog inside of the large hose. Vacuum worked, still not much suction. i then pulled out the main filter and cleaned it, and voila! I have a virtually new vacuum. someone was misinformed and never cleaned the filter, which led to subsequent problems and threw it away.I know. I have a low-end model Kenmore that I've spent plenty of time messing with it. YOu get what you pay for."
1,Broke The First Day!!,"I received this vacuum as a wedding gift and it broke the very first day I used it. EVERY time that you slightly bump into any piece of furniture or wall, the belt jumps off and you have to reset it CONSTANTLY. Not only is it a pain to have to take it apart to do this, but it has done it so often that the warmth of the belt has started to melt the belt guard on the bottom of the vacuum. I am in the process of getting a full refund from Bissell. I must admit that for the few minutes that it works before breaking again, it did get out a major amount of dirt out of my carpet but that is worth nothing if it doesn't work. I do not recommend this vacuum to anyone!"
4,Does what it says,If you've never used a bagless vacuum before it'll take a little while to get used to using this one. The canister is a little small and cleaning it out can be tedious. My apartment had new carpet put in and the canister was full before i was even halfway thru vacuuming my 1-1 due to all the carpet fibers. I'm used to the canister emptying process now and I'm perfectly content with this vacuum's cleaning power.
2,Poor build quality,"Bissell's lower end vacuums simply aren't reliable. There's 4 different places dirt can (and regularly) gets caught in. Constant clogs really take away from it's above average cleaning potential which is doesn't usually reach after a few minutes of use. Also, after once a week use for a year the belt on the vacuum is falling off. I'd recommend a $99-$150 Eureka or Hoover instead."
2,Good Short Term Vacuum,"I bought this because it was inexpensive and it was bagless, which I thought was ""better"" than a vacuum with bags.It was awesome and worked very well during the 1st year. I love the attachments because I use them to clean the carpet in my car too.The second year I started noticing that it missed larger dirt on the floor.By the end of the 3rd year, it wouldn't even pick up fuzz.I have taken it apart regularly, cleaned all of the filters and the rolling thing under the vacuum that runs on the floor. But it has just lost power."
3,HEAVY!,"I guess I'm not used to all these new bagless vaccumes, but holy cow, this is HEAVY! When you're actually using it, it gets my arm sore! Im not a weakling at all. I exercise regularly and have a 2 year old. It sucks up dirt better than Id expected, but it literally hurts my arm after 2 rooms! It works well, but you have to have strong arms! Im making vaccuming my husbands job from now on!!"
1,Piece of junk,"This vaccum constantly clogs, either the filter cannister, etc, etc.Do not waste your money."
1,Don't look here for suction power.,"I do not recommend this vacuum for the simple reason it doesn't have any suction power. For those of you that have animals, I really mean that statement for you. The vacuum attachments have no suction power, the machine is particularly noisy, and you constantly have to clean the vacuum itself due to the dust all over the machine after using. Dust in one side and out the other. It will not pick up small bits of cat food from around the dishes, it will not pick up small ""needles"" from the fake christmas tree. I constantly have to clean the hoses out because the suction is so poor that it cannot get the debris up into the ""bagless"" container. If any does, usually some hair, it gets wrapped all around the spindle in the top and when you clean that off, dust and other material falls on the carpet as well. Too much work for the price. I adore Kirby's. I will stick with them."
1,What a mess!!!!!!!,"Cleaning this vacuum is an ordeal. It should have a huge warning label on the box reading ""Cleaning this vacuum is gross dusty mess, and you are required to do it often"". It cannot be healthy to enhail all that dust during cleaning. Customer service at Bissell is HORRIBLE too. Don't waste your time or money on this product or any Bissell product! Go for another brand."
2,Too Soon To Tell,"Machine broke 3rd time I used it! Part broke off inside and literally burned up...melted the insides. Took it to an authorized repair and got it fixed under warranty, but it took 3 weeks to get the parts. Service guy said it was the 2nd he had seen in the last month with same problem.It vacuums well, but..."
2,Terrible vaccum,"This is a terrible vaccum. I bought one, and after using it only a few times the belt slipped too far over and burned off some of the plastic on the underside. I thought it was a fluke, so I returned it for another one. Same thing happened, but I couldn't afford a more expensive one. So I just got used to having to take off the bottom and move over the belt every so often when it would start to smell hot. I've been doing this for about a year, but today was the last straw - the belt completely slipped off it's retaining rod. Add the tippiness, completely illogical location for the base of the cord (on the side, meaning you trip or roll over it constantly), the ""strips"" on the left side that never got clean and had to be vaccumed a second time with the middle or right side of the sweeper... I would never, ever recommend this vaccum, and will never buy a Bissell again. The only things I WILL give it are relatively decent suction and the fact that it's lightweight."
1,Don't waste your time.,We've had this vacuum for less than a year and it has broken 3 times. The belt seems to be the problem. Sometimes the budget buy is not worth the frustration.
2,Only lasted 2 years!,"Overall, I liked this vacuum, but I bought this vacuum for its overall great reviews. But, it was a short lived vacuum. burning smell led me to replace the belt and then the burning smell was worse! Did not work well on my higher nap carpet and the extras piece on the front quit working after one use. I vacuum a lot with pets and I would not buy this product again because of the durability. I guess you get what you pay for..."
1,DANGER! Belt will burn!,"Here's the thing about this vacuum that makes me so angry- the belt is hooked over the brush where it sits in a grooved position holding it there so it doesn't slide around. Wonderful, my old Kirby didn't have that, the belt was on the bare surface of the brush cylinder. Now move towards the back of the vacuum and see the place where the belt hooks onto to make it move. A metal rod. That's it, nothing on the end of it. Nothing to block it from sliding off when it gets heated up and loose. *angry face* So it slides off and burns through the plastic on the side wall and starts to smoke. HORRIBLE DESIGN BISSELL! What were you thinking?? The only solution, from what I see, is buying new belts that are tighter so they won't easily slide off. That means spending $7 to $10 every couple of months on this POS. A Dyson will be my next vacuum. The money is worth it- I'll never have to deal with this incompetence again."
3,Not as good as 3M,"Compared to 3M, these belts clog quicker, fray at the edges and do not last as long."
2,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH IRISH VIDEO SYSTEM,i ORDERED A VIDEO ON LINE THINKING IT WOULD BE WORK HERE FOR US. ONLY TO FIND IT WAS ONLY FOR A US MACHINE. HAD TO BRING IT TO A COMPANY IN TOWN TO SWITCH FROM VHS TO BETA WHICH IS MORE COSTS INCURRED. PITY IT DOESNT SHOW SOMEWHERE WHEN PURCHASING THAT IT IS A USA ONLY TAPE.
1,Tape/Recording Quality Horrible!!,"The quality of the audio cassette I received was so bad I couldn't concentrate on the actual content. Ann moved back and forth from the microphone which, of course, increased and decreased the microphone's ""pick up."" In addition, it contained a countless number of popping ""P""s. However, most annoying of all, the tape sounded as if it was recorded at the bottom of a large tin can -- the tape was very flat (mono). When paying forty dollars for a single cassette tape, I expect more than merely an amateur production; I expect and am entitled to a professional production. Very dissappointed."
2,Not really informative for people applying to med schools.,"I do not recommend this book if you're in the process of applying to med schools because the section on that particular topic is rather basic. You won't get the ""insider's"" take on the application process. I get the feeling that the author tried to make his book seem longer/bigger by having things like pages and pages of medical school addresses (why would I need that from him when I can get that easily elsewhere for FREE?). BOTTOMLINE: not an insider's guide at all."
1,"Overgeneralized, Not helpful to anyone seriously applying","If you as a premed know nothing, I mean nothing about the medical school admissions process, then this book can be used for a start. I found it to be lacking of original information. The author's attempts to full the books pages is obvious. Simple test to see if you need this book. -----Do you know what the MCAT is (yes or no). If ""no"" you need this book, if ""yes"" you do not. This book skims the most basic of basic admissions info."
3,Not what I expected,"Fair warning--if you aren't positive you want to be a doctor yet, get this book. If you're looking for a hint of MCAT study material and very generalized background information on medical school admissions, get this book. Only 3 chapters concern admissions. That's only 58 of its 192 pages devoted to admissions. Most of the information it contains concerns what to expect while in medical school and even study material for the boards, but I certainly do not feel the title is appropriate. An ""Insider's Guide To Medical School ADMISSIONS"" it is not. It's an interesting collection of medical information though, so for that purpose this book is worth the money, but not as advertised....certainly not an admissions guide."
5,great,Everything that was described by the author from filling out the applications to interviewing was right on the mark. I was shocked when my interviewers asked me questions that were word for word in the book. I was ready for them and did well. I think the section on grading yourself as a candidate is helpful because it lets you know where you stand. I have told all the premed undergraduates in our club to buy the book. Can't say enough about this book.
3,"S0-SO, But I found another good book***","I brought two books, this one and another one at the same time. This book is very idealistic and repetitive. I knew most info already. But I found a very good book written by some renegade ivy students at [...] , I strongly recommend that one. That book has strategy and is scary."
4,Dated but Powerful,"Unfortunately, we are left with a relative paucity of Robeson's powerful talent. This early film will give you some indication of the majesty he must have conveyed live. No other figure in the first half of the 20th century conveyed the collective black consciousness as did Robeson. We have a few markers left us, amongst them the recordings and these few celluloid records. If you want to see one of the giants of the 20th century on film, buy this edition. It also represents a cinemataographic record of one of O'Neill's most famous, but least successful plays. True, the plot has its tensions and the play had its merits, but, in comparison to his monumental ""Morning Becomes Electra"" and ""Desire Under the Elms,"" this play is decidedly secondary, in league with ""The Hairy Ape."""
1,ten worst movies of all time,"This movie is absurd and unrealistic in its presentation of African American human beings. It simply shows the thinking and beliefs of the sick racist mind of white americans during their own aparthied years of racist subjugation of African American citizens. No one but a white person could enjoy this fantasy representation of African Americans, this (sic) movie is an insult to all free people...."
2,worked great at first.,I loved the vacuumn cleaner at first - it seemed to work really great. The dirt holder was a bit messy to clear out though as the dust tended to stay in the two smaller sections and its not very hygienic to reach in and clear it out.Apart from that it worked great until a couple of weeks ago where the external small brush has stopped rotating and the whole thing sounds like a jetliner taking off. The suction has detiorated rapidly.Fortunately it's (just) within the 90 day return policy so it's going back tomorrow.
4,"Works great, but...............................","This vacumn really picks up the dirt, pet hair etc very well. We have a dog, 2 cats and a bird so we have a lot of hair and feathers. The first day I used the unit the canister was full after one room which was amazing. I had just vacumned a couple of days prior. I'm impressed with that factor. The only thing I don't like about mine is that the hose keeps falling loose. I like the fact that there is a long cord as my old machine didn't even reach to the other side of the room. All in all a good product abd reasonably priced."
2,If you can't afford a better vacuum!,"This vacuum only works with maximum performance for a little while. When we first bought this vacuum it did it's job, sucked up the dirt. It needs to be cleaned out a lot!!! I've never had to clean out a vacuum so much. Overall I was disappointed with it after about 3months.I have recently purchased the dyson dc17 and love it! It works a lot better and doesn't need to be cleaned out all the time. It doesn't get clogged either."
1,wait until you own it for a while,"filth and foul is what you will have in no short order. 25 years of repairing vacuum cleaners and it has come to this? there is not a vacuum cleaner manufactured that probably does not work great just out of the box. new belt , new brush roller , fresh filter or bag. why its just like driving a new car. does it get any better than this? 70% of all owners of bagless vacuums will not get another one. and Bissell leads the pack as to why. constant attention to the filters and at least 90% of my customers cant find ALL the filters. 1, 2, 3, 4. count them, you may find all this constant cleaning of filters and dumping and scraping out of bins acceptable. if so, you have found nirvana. because this machine and its predecessors blow dust and debris from one filter to the next. Is it a value? ultimately, that is determined after the fact unfortunately. A good name like Bissell could have done much better."
2,For another time,"This book has not been helpful to me in this first few months of loss. Although it does show similarities people have in their experience of deep grief, it does not offer solutions. Shakesphere and Poe may have had similar experiences, and may have written about them elloquently, but that doesn't help me today. I think this book needs to be targeted to a diferent population than those of us who are looking for answers."
5,Very Very Helpful Book,"Although it has been 15 years since the terrible loss of my very much loved daughter this book helped me very much. I have read many, many books since she passed away but find I am still searching for answers as well as ways to cope. I am glad to find there are other people who have suffered this loss and are much better at putting their feelings into words that I am. So many times I found myself thinking, ""Yes!!!!!!!! that is exactly what I have been feeling"". I recommend this for anyone experiencing this loss but only to read after a couple of years have passed. I know it takes that long to read something like this with a different perspective. I don't know that it would have helped the first couple of years, although nothing could help then."
5,My story,"I lost my seventeen year old son in a auto accident this year.Alot of people have their religion and faith to fall back on, others (like me) find their faith has been shaken when the worst that can happen, happens. There are no answers for the neverending questions you have after you lose your son or daughter, especially the hardest one is why? You won't find the answers in a book or in any place on earth, it has to come from inside you.This book is just a guide to help you, a collection of stories from other people, famous and not so famous. It's like getting a personal letter from someone who understands, as if they wrote it just for you and your child without getting lost in any one belief or philosophy. It comes from the heart."
3,Good But Not Much Standout Material,"I enjoy the music of John Cafferty. He and his band are very reminiscent of Bruce Springsteen with a slightly different slant. All the songs are quite good but there is limited variety here. Most of it is merely mid tempo with the same mix between the instruments. If you are a fan of Bruce, Southside Johnny, Bon Jovi, and the general Jersey/working class sound, then you might want to give this a listen. Not quite as good as Eddie and the Cruisers but good enough for my collection. You make the call if you want it in yours."
4,A Great Kids' Scary Book,"Students at my school library are always asking for scary books, but appropriate stories are few and far between. This will satisfy many of them. Set in Colonial Massachusetts, the story, in which a dog digs up a bone from the body of Nicholas Greebe begins an incredible, hundred-year journey for that bone. Greebe's ghost waits and haunts his former home until the bone miraculously returns. The illustrations add just the right detail and mood to the story."
5,The Terra-Cotta Dog,"Since I have found the Inspector Montalbano series, I am hooked. Can't do anything because all I want to do is read him. I particularly loved the Terra-Cotta Dog. These books sweep me to Sicily where my father was from. And the characters are really great. Love them all."
4,A Slice of Sicilian,"Even if Camilleri's mysteries weren't set in Sicily, they would be successful: the characters are compelling, the premise of the mystery is interesting, and the plot moves forward with the right amount of action and reflection. But the setting-Sicily in all its Godfather glory-makes The Terra-Cotta Dog uniquely valuable. I'm working my way through all the Inspector Montalbano mysteries and thoroughly enjoying every one. This is the best so far."
4,You Can't Not Like It,"It's about the mafia and I really liked it? There's a first. Convoluted, humorous, intelligent, multifaceted mystery that's based in Sicily. There are slapstick moments, which is generally what I dislike about a great deal of Italian humor but here it works. The quaint jokes and style of sexuality are also very Italian and somehow a breath of fresh air. Camilleri's protagonist is the professionally confident yet private and publicly awkward Montalbano. Isn't that often how these things work and work it does. Fortunately for me, I just got back from a vacation to many of the stunning and culturally rich places written about, which has nothing to do with why I finally like a story about the mafia but does aid in visualization. This book is simply extremely refreshing and entertaining. You can't not like it.P.S. His cover art is great."
3,"D. McKay, Nashville, TN","After reading and enjoying several Nordic crime novelists, on a recommendation from a newspaper article, I decided to try this Italian writer. I enjoyed the story but found it a bit lightweight in the mystery category."
3,"Comical, Convoluted Story",I enjoy reading books from other cultures and parts of the world. The translated version of this book from Italian to English seemed accurate with cultural nuances intact. The story plodded along from Italian food to characters to story line. The story line was not always coherent.
4,The Dog,Very enjoyable. Its the second Inspector Montalbano I've read and I intend to read more. Maybe a little over the toponce in a while but worth it.
5,My first book by Camilleri-- I'm very pleased. :),"Oh, I really enjoyed this! I feel as though I should build this review up in a more dramatic way, but it really is a simple reaction.I loved the setting in Sicily. I liked the plot. I liked the character of Inspector Montalbano. I am very pleased that I have another one of these sitting on my bookshelf. I am very close to delighted that the reviews suggest that this is not Camilleri's best-- I have other good things in store!No quarrels. Just recommendations."
5,The Snack Thief,"Any and all of Camilleri's books are worth reading. The series of books are set in Sicily and Salvo Montalbano, Chief Inspector of the small town of Vigata, is a footloose,brooding batchelor, who manages his sleuthing and lovelife with equal skill. He loves his Sicialian seafood and eats with gusto, if and when he remembers to eat as he goads his men and himself in the pursuit of criminals."
4,A must read for people attending a Community College!,"An excellent book that exposes the truth about learning instutions that advertise themselves those who ""put the highest priority on teaching"". Honored But Invisible shows how Community Colleges really place little regard in the quality of instruction and instead, place the greatest emphasis on increasing enrollment. The lowering of standards in order to achieve this goal is not a concern. Affirmative action also is given too much priority in the hiring processes. The sad thing is, that once these instructors are hired, it takes only 4 years to receive tenure, (unlike a 4-year university where it takes 7 years)and then it is almost impossible to get rid of them."
4,This is a knitting resource for offbeat symbolic patterns.,"This paperback book is essential for the knitting putterer who fancies herself/himself a quirky creator of meaningful originals. Included are hundreds of charts for adding animals, borders or characters to a knitted piece. The charts are sometimes complex and there is not enough color in the book, but if you're creating something that would benefit from non-cutesy wolves, spiritual symbols, Chinese characters or ancient Egyptian symbols, here's where you'll find them, ready for the needles"
3,"""Okay"" is a pretty good word to describe the book","""Midnight Justice"" is not a graphic novel, but a paperback novel featuring Venom and Spider-man. Like the other reviewer that read it, I find it neither fantastic nor horrible, just...okay.The plot is a pretty accurate description of the Spider-man and Venom relationship. Venom hunts Spider-man in a deadly game of cat and mouse. Venom knows that Peter Parker is the actual alter ego of Spider-man.Venom believes Spider-man to be a ruthless manipulator that destroyed his media career. Eddie Brock, the man who merged with an alien symbiote, vowed vengeance upon Spider-man. Unlike Carnage, a ruthless serial killer also a symbiote-merged villain in the Spider-man universe, Eddie truly believes that he serves justice and protects innocent life.Can Spider-man outmaneuver the deadly Venom and escape from harm? If you want to know, read the book!"
5,Devastating,"This book is extremely well written. Not only was I completely absorbed and always wanting to find out what happened next, but I found myself almost ""living"" what these poor people went through in the hands of such deluded and destructive ""therapists"". The author brings the material so much to life, that it is easy to feel the pain, confusion and devastation the ""patients"" went through. Particularly sad are the final chapters of the book, in which the patients come to realize what has been done to them: the lies they have been told, the abuse they have suffered, and the years that have been wasted. It takes some of them quite a while to reach this stage, after a blind sort of wading and groping through layers of disbelief and confusion. A very sobering, deep, and painful account."
3,don't follow leaders,"Well folks, this book is very informative. But i got somethingway better to say to you. I was there in that cult. I saweverything happen from day one until the end. I survived thecult and I did everything in power to bring this cult down.We sued and won, and we had the State of California go afterthese rotten bastards as hard as they could. We did this sothese lying snakes would never harm another ""patient"" againin their lives. Feel free to ask me about the details ofthis cult. crsds@hotmail.com"
3,Pleasant Book,"Tomas' character is based on Tomas Rivera, a man whose life from migrant worker to university chancellor was helped along by an Iowan librarian he knew as a child. In this heartwarming tale, Tomas is presented as a shy, awkward child who is made to feel welcome in the public library. As Tomas reads stories of dinosaurs, tigers, and the Wild West, he forgets his difficult life. He even teaches the librarian some Spanish words, which he discovers is something he enjoys - enough to make a career in education.Any of us who have worked in a public library can recognize these characters. The kind librarian provides a water fountain and the right books for the right child. What could better sum up our mission?The earth toned illustrations look like pastels and convey whimsy and pleasantness. Overall this is a good book for any child who wants an inspiring story."
5,Outstanding!,"These are probably the best bookshelf speakers you can buy at ANY price!YEs, they are 4-ohm impedance so you need a high-current amp or receiver and yes, they are heavy but oh, what beautiful sound!oh yeah, they look at good as they sound."
2,boomy mid/low bass,"i have owned a pair for two years, driven by outlaw or adcom amps. I now have enough experience with it to say something solid and objective. These speakers have bright tweeters, good for jazz and classical music where the sound does not get too low. When it comes to mid-bass, it is loose, muddy, boomy and often going out of control to create annoying sound. This is a well-known issue discussed on the polk forum. I have tried different placement/padding, to no avail. I have no experience with other higher end system, so i cannot really tell whether this is what you deserve for the money you pay. But, i am very disappointed, and is ready to move on to a pair of Magnepan MMG. With this experience, i will not recommend LSi9 for a mid-fi system."
4,Disappointed with the ending,"I guess after so many really successful seasons it was really hard to know how to tie it all up. Personally, I feel that when Dr. Cuddy left the show the quality declined."
2,The Shark,"I believe House jumped the shark with Cuddy's departure, although the loss of other characters did not help. Dropping Cameron, Amber and Masters were very bad choices. Amber could have provided Wilson with some backbone. Masters looked like the would be some morality added to his office."
1,"Excellent series, cheap package, thin cheap dvds.....","My complaint is with Universal for using thin cheap dvds and putting them in a package designed to maximize profits rather than provide easy access in getting them out to play or protecting them from getting damaged. It's not worth the trouble to send it back and wait for a replacement. From now on if it says ""Universal"" on the box, I'm staying away. I guess that Universal thinks because dvds are on their way out, why bother using good ones?"
1,Terrible Quality,"While the show is good, the streaming is not adequate. It pauses and buffers routinely and I have a 50Mb/s connection downstream in Charlotte, NC. Netflix, Hulu on my PC and my Apple TV stream flawlessly."
3,"Not the best of Greg, but finale was great!","While the sudden exodus of Lisa Edelstein (Dr. Cuddy) from the cast was a great loss, and the change of cast working directly for House was unexpected, the finale of the show was a great episode, recapping House's emotional past and highlighting his most important relationships-Proof that Wilson really was the most important person in his life-what a sacrifice!"
3,Great show ruined by the Last Show,"I know I am in the minority but I felt the last show was a lot like the last ""Rescue Me"" episode, it destroyed all the greatness that had come before it. I was prepeared for something great and instead I was given middle of the road. Only wish they could have taken more time and thought it through before ending it that way. Could have gone out great instead of limping out."
2,House season 8,Not as good as the first seven seasons. The episode had gotten to far out of reality. should have stopped at seven.
2,Housebroken,"What a disappointment! Season Eight makes you want to go back to Season Seven and rewrite the final episode so that House perishes when he crashes into Cuddy's house. The writing is terrible, the charactors undeveloped and the acting below par. It almost seems like the writers had a contest with the casting director to see who could do the worst job by creating a terrible charactor (Dr. Park) and filling the role with an awful actress (Charlyne Yi). They should have quit producing this series while they were ahead."
4,The Doctor's Last Call,"""House, M.D. November 16, 2004 - May 21, 2012I love this show and will always be a fan of the series, but it has continuously been going downhill and I must admit has not been on my favorites list. Although ""HOUSE, M.D."" had a great run, I felt it lost everything that once made it such an outstanding show... a couple seasons ago.Aside from the previous comments, I will miss this show for three reasons. One being, it was once a spectacular series and it's sad to see it end without returning to its original glory. Two, the interaction between House and Wilson has always been a big highlight of the show, to me. Lastly, I will miss Hugh Laurie. I feel no one could have played a better Dr. Gregory House.All and all, I recommend season eight if you are a fan and want to follow the show until the end."
5,Love House!,"I hated to see this show go off, but now I will never miss it again. I can watch it anytime I want to with my own collection."
2,should have ended a season earlier,"The last season of House was a disappointment, bringing in new characters I couldn't care about and making House unlikable in a way he'd never been before."
5,fantastic,"i love house m.d. hate its over with, great idea new and sealed, no scratches and the case was perfect"
5,Love House,"I cannot get enough of House, but Season 8, just like all the other seasons, was awesome. I'd definitely recommend anyone to either buy it or rent it."
5,Gotta Love House!,"Love this series, wish there were more!! What more can you say? Excellent writing for this show, and its nice to watch episodes without commercials!"
5,This DVD season collection is the perfect finish to the first seven seasons!,"I have been a fan of House since it first premiered back in 2004, and I have all of the first seven seasons on DVD. The eighth season (while having been somewhat lackluster and missing some of its original cast members, particularly Lisa Edelstein and Jennifer Morrison!) brings the title character full circle with an unexpected and final walk into the sunset (with his best friend Wilson). I highly recommend it to all fans of the series!"
