1,i placed order on 9/30 and won't recieve subscription till 11/20,there must be faster way to begin subscription - close to two months to recieve magazine subscription is not desirable to my taste.
2,Too much stuff about celebrities...who cares!,"Got this mag cause I wanted a style magazine. Its obsessed with celebrities. I could care less...and I love in LA.Anyway, if you like TMZ you will prob like this mag. Not what I expected. Will not be renewing."
1,A magazine but,80+% of it is nothing but ads. To me it's not worth it. If there were this many ads in any other media no one would view it.
1,Has not arrrived,"I ordered a subscription before Christmas and I still have not recieved the first issue. I guess I should cancel it? What say you, amazon staff???? Lame!!!"
4,A magazine that modern men need.,"Do you sometimes feel that you are not really following up on the various aspects of your lifestyle? Esquire is what you need. they keep on updating you on the trends, and happenings. Not every man has the time to browse through tens of websites on the various topics that are important to the 21st century man. My monthly magazine is like a concentrated dosage of all of that."
4,A good read,Esquire is usually the magazine I pick up and read when I am waiting to get my hair cut or sitting at an airport. The articles are interesting and often humorous. I enjoy the sections on men's fashion. Esquire is definitely the best of the men's magazines.
2,Only for the obnoxiously vain,"I really hate magazines like this that have more advertisements for 800.00 shoes than they do actual articles on anything remotely interesting. I subscribed for a year but I hardly even crack the pages open when it comes in the mail now. Is anybody really as vain as the editors seem to assume that we are? I think you might like this magazine if you are a money hungry elitist who abandoned your kids in the pursuit of a bigger office and a nicer car. IF you are interseted in which 10,000 dollar watch best fits your summer wardrobe then this magazine is for you."
3,Is This Wired or Esquire?,"Being a mature reader (age-wise) I was a little disappointed to see the tiny print and attention-deficit coverage in the articles. It isn't the Esquire of old now with shallow topic coverage, nineteen items per page and form (visual style) over content.And the print size of this review is larger than the font in the magazine.It's no wonder it costs less than the postage."
1,Not for anyone that isn't a hipster and not worth a million or more,"Esquire has some major problems. Their writers are out of touch with the average person. Look at the clothes they are promoting. Not only do they look awful, but they cost more than some factory workers make in a month! Add to that, the fact that most of the articles are just filler. It's disappointing, and once my subscription runs out, that's it. Goodbye, forever."
3,Get only if you will read,Didn't really read a single copy. They all went to the recycle bin after sitting in a pile for over a year. Would be a great mag if I had actually read them.
5,Esquire magazine,"Very pleased with the promptness and the price of my magazine order purchase. My son-in-law received a card and the magazine in time for his birthday. I would recommend Amazon to anyone looking to purchase online. They have been efficient and safe. Thank you, Amazon."
2,Past its prime,I picked this up over the holiday for $5 and am glad I didn't pay full price. Esquire is well past its prime and is just a so-so magazine now. Its articles and writing are generic and the interviews are uninteresting. Advertisements make up most of the bulk of the magazine itself. Save your money and if you really need to read Esquire do it online on their website.
5,#1 subscription to have,"This is by far my favorite magazine. It has creative and edgy design wrapped around interesting/entertaining articles and insight. If I could only choose one magazine to read, this would be it."
4,Esquire magazine subscription ( 1-year auto-renewal ),"Simple review: I ordered the subscription and the magazine arrived. Must determine what ""1-year auto-renewal"" actually means. I do not object to renewal at the original price; if the tariff increases automatically on renewal, then this could be a ripoff."
4,magazine confirmation,I think it is great to get a discount on the magazine of your choice but why doesn't the magazine confirm that we are getting a discount so that there is an understanding of how long (months) the magazine will be coming to our front door. That way we don't have to wonder whether the discount was reported to the magazine and that we are getting it. It seems the right way to handle the magazine discount business. gerald moorehead.
2,Esquire,It's pretty much the same magazine I used to read in college. A whole lot of fashion. Too much. Too girlie.
2,too many adds,"I know these fashion mags have a lot of adds, but it seems like I flip through over 20 pages before I find anything to read. If you took the adds out, you problaby wouldn't have much more then a flyer left."
3,"just fine, and probably will renew","Pretty interesting articles, and refreshing broad topics. Biggest complaint is lots of ad's, but then again its good for them as print magazines are struggling."
3,Disappointed,"I absolutely love Esquire. My problem was the lack of Esquires I was receiving I did not get 11 issues.. MAYBE I got 7 total. It was a major let down. I did recieve a replacment issue when one I got was torn in half, so that was nice but I would never do this again."
3,"Not bad for value, but...","The content can be a little lacking and buried behind pages and pages of ads. But for the price, what can you expect?"
1,Overly Political / Dated Fashion,"The Editor's letter and a lot of the articles seem to always have a strong Right Wing agenda. I guess that's fine if you want that, but that's not what I want in my magazines. I could live with that aspect, if only the fashion section had some sense of being useful. In my opinion, their suiting articles seem to be about five years behind GQ and their casual dress advice is aimed at the most bland uninspired bro/fratboy.In other words, I regret this subscription and will not be renewing."
2,"The magazine is great, but","The information I received when I placed the order was that I would receive my first issue in 4 - 6 weeks. Fine, I then purchased the current issue at the newsstand because it was going to be 4 - 6 weeks before my subscription started. WRONG! I got the same issue in the mail 3 days later.I'm all for quick service, but incorrect information sucks."
2,Bought it for my boyfriend and......,my boyfriend received the magazine and said the magazine is really boring! lol..he said that the articles aren't interesting at all!..next time..im going with another guy mag! lol..funny thing is he requested this magazine..
1,magazine,i ordered this magazine by accident. i tried to cancel the order immediately. i got NO response. i tried again to cancel the order the next day and received NO response. i'm not happy with this transaction at all.
2,HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANYTHING YET,"BY FAR, I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANYTHING YET. JUST DON'T GET WHY IT TOOK SO LONG! SO I COULD NOT REALLY RATE IT!"
2,Magazine,"It is not what I like to read, not my kind of magazine to read. Guess I need to review at store before I buy any other magazines. Everyone should review the magazines at store before order any."
1,Do not do buisness with this company - NEVER RECIEVED still awaiting money back,Choose another option I kept on waiting and submitted several Amazon complaints trying to see what was going on with my order and not once did I receive a response now I just canceled it and want my money back...who knows if I will ever get reimbursed.
1,Corny Magzine for Corny Men,"I had the dishonor of getting a free subscription to this magazine. To say the least it sucks. The articles aren't interesting, you'll find yourself thinking about other things. This magazine isn't even worthy of being a ""bathroom read."" Sorry, but when you won't even read this while your taking a DUMP... that's a pretty bad magazine..."
4,Read on!,Just received my first issue...earlier than expected...enjoy this magazine much! I like reading issues from a man's point of view.
2,Pretty lame Southern gothic humor,"I suppose this is meant to be a funny take-off on the Southern gothic novel, but it turns out to be a pretty lame knock-off of ""Cold Comfort Farm"" set in South Carolina. Not worth your time."
1,"smarmy, at best","i picked up this book with pleasure, because i have always had a fondness for QEII. i was horribly disappointed......Erickson probably got the facts right (not that i would know), but the whole tone of her not so graceful writing was that of a smarmy, i know more than you do, approach to an account of a person that could have been fascinating, instead of one that was boring, dull, and pedestrian...do not waste your time or money!"
5,Great lessons for Kids ...,"How can adults cover every lesson each child needs through life? Start with this series, ""Book of Virtues."" My niece and nephew are 4 & 7 and love them. They are truly terrific videos with loving, calming messages. Their parents prefer this to ""Sponge-Bob"", etc. & the kids always request their 'learning stories.'"
5,Grateful Kids Books,"I've always loved Jerry Garcia's work with the Grateful Dead, but when he teamed up with his longtime friend and bluegrass playing buddy David Grisman, I was more than excited to see the fruits of their efforts. This being one of a few, Jenny Jenkins is a very fun and playful song and children's book combined. Something young children should always be treated to as they grow and develop."
4,Don't use CDs,"After mindlessly following the advice of someone who allegedly used Goof Off to clean a DVD, I ruined one of my favorite CDs because the solvent corroded the whole polycarbonate plastic layer on the disc. Don't use this on CDs or DVDs!!!"
3,More advanced art book,I really enjoy this book but it is not for everyone. If you have a degree in art or a good knowledge of Italian art then I would suggest it. The Sienese painter's were in a class of their own and comparing them to the rest of Italian art of this period is interesting.
5,Rhetoric Major,"This book encompasses the nature of argument, language, persuasion and my entire Rhetoric Major that I spent four years working on. Reading it will make you smarter."
5,Relaxation works.,"The CD uses breathing and progressive muscle relaxation as induction technique.After reading some articles on hypnosis online and elsewhere I had expected something in the line of walking down stairs or riding an elevator for induction. But this works quite as well for me. It does not require you to build up tension before the relaxation (like the Jacobson method would); except maybe for three deep breaths you are asked to take at the beginning.I was curious whether an audio CD would work with me at all (not being a native speaker), but I had very few difficulties. I had to look up the word ""diaphragm"" though. I have mostly used the relaxation exercise and only once or twice listened to the stress reduction part. So I cannot give advice on its effectiveness."
4,"nice comp, good selection of games, but 2 problems...","Problem #1-VERY SLOW loading times. You have been warned.Problem #2-hear those cool 80's singles during the opening screen, especially the joystick song? Unlike the Atari comp, one cannot continue listening to them during the games! What's up with that?"
1,Worse than last one!,"This 50th anniversary collection stinks! The last release named namco museum was MUCH better, in addition to the original games you get a remake version with updated graphics and stuff.This 50th collection is just original games, nothing else. The menu and options are dumbed down too, for example you CAN'T set the screen to split mode which puts all the score and number on one side which you CAN do in the last collection.Overall this game is worse than the last one! Should be renamed Namco museum don't buy this 50th collection get the previous version! Unless you really want the few extra games like rolling thunder or dragon spirit."
1,BEWARE PS3 users,"I purchased this game for my grandson, (that's a hint that I'm old and not really a gamer) not relizing that it isn't compatable with PS3, not the fault of the seller. I was told by a pimple faced teen ager in a Toys R Us store that ps2 games can be played on the ps3. Silly me, dupped by a teen ager! Anyone in the market for a (Im sure its great) Namco Museum 50th Anniversary game??"
2,Namco Museum 50th Anniversary,These games are not as fun as I remember them. The games are slow and feel like they go no where.
5,excellent,my family was excited to get this game and couldn't wait to play it! the whole family loves the old arcade classics!
1,If you don't absolutly have to play one of the games on here it's not worth the money.,Compared to other collections of atari games this has a small selection of game. I bought this after buying actavision anthology and was surprised by the quality difference.
2,It's just not the same!,"The arcade versions of these games are so great, but Namco missed the mark here by not including the arcade versions. It's distracting and almost like learning a new game b/c they are so much different. I was really looking forward to this game and then it was so disappointing. Positives for this game--lots of variety!"
1,Boooring!,I should have listened to other people. This game set is boring and the graphics are terrible.
5,great memories,"I love this game. Playing pac-man, ms pac man again after so many years is great. friends want to have game nights and see who is the best (cause we all might have exagerated how good we used to be!)"
3,oldskool2000,"My husband and I are 50+ we were looking for some games that we used to play in the arcades when we were dating. Some of the games are very lame, and some I never heard of but it was worth buying because I love galaga and he loves dig dug. It also has pacman and mspacman. So all in all it was worth the money"
4,a great collection of my favorites,I purchased this game for myself and was very surprised to find my kds going crazy for them. I barely have a chance to play it anymore. I love these games. Reminds me of the old pizza shop where you can play pacman and grab a slice of pizza. Good times.
5,Namco Museum 50th Anniversary,"For Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-man alone this is worth it to me, but it has 16 other games too. My husband and I stayed up playing for most of the night as soon as we got it."
4,Amazing,Thanks for the excellent service and quick shipping.This was one of the game I want to have for a long time.Thank's again
5,Concise,The book is very concise and to the point. It provides you with the information that you seek effectively.
4,Very good roller,The roller nap lasts and is very durable for several usages. It's a little expensive but is well worth the money.
5,What,"John Coltrane and Latin???? I LOVE IT............. What a wonderful experience to hear Coltrane with a Latin flair. Thanks!!! I did'nt know whether to salsa or just groove....... Anyway,,,,, what a delightful exercise in listening pleasure."
4,fun,"i'm not a big fan of having my daughter play with barbie's overall, but it is nice to have the option of different skin colors at least. it is nice also to have the career series."
2,An insufferable woman does nothing.,"An articulate and intelligent letter writer, the heroine nevertheless is a silly, shallow, snobbish woman who lives through much of the twentieth century but barely notices anything about it and is unaffected by it. She does nothing interesting except travel, but seems to learn very little and has little to say about what she sees. She has no discernible sense of humor, although she does turn a good phrase now and again."
5,A must read for both sexes!,"This is quite simply an amazing book. It follows one woman's entire life through the letters that she writes to others. This woman is not always a role model, not always nice, but always human. She lives, suffers, triumphs, expresses opinions and evolves as we read on. I have recommended this book to my friends, parents and boyfriend and all have loved it! Insightful, inspiring, a look into one woman's ordinary life. A must-read!"
2,"A Woman of Independent Means, But Not of Substance","I usually don't post reviews of books I don't care for, but A Woman of Indedepent Means provoked me! As other reviewers have noted, except for the tragedies Bess endured, it was a dull account of a wealthy, snobbish woman. Bess was the author's grandmother, and these tragic events actually occured. I therefore have compassion for Bess as a real person who lived from the turn of the century through the late 60's. Given the backdrop of this dramatic period of history, I was all the more disappointed that her personal losses drove the narrative. Surely the author had access to her grandmother's photographs and other memoribilia? Their inclusion would have added some realilty and zest to a life that quite frankly, I found I cared less and less about as the book went on."
3,Not my Cup of Tea,"This book was O.K. After reading the rave reviews, I was expecting something with more depth. Instead of that there is a story told by a series of letters depicting one disaster after another from the letter writer's point of view. It ultimately became very boring for me to keep reading what is essentially the same story at different times of this lady's life. It is not a terrible book, but there is not much new in it. The characters never come alive because the reader sees them from Bess's viewpoint and that is very limiting. If you want to spend an afternoon reading a series of letters from one woman about her family and events in her life, then this book is for you. But if you want something with a little more meat in it, look elsewhere."
2,A Woman of Wealth Solves Many of Life's Problems,"I was interested in reading this book to see whether one could write a whole story through a one-sided correspondence. The author managed it rather well. But the premise of the story seemed simplistic to me. Even though the author tells us she based the book on someone in her family I think it has limited appeal. The character ""Bess"" solved, resolved or escaped problems through her limitless wealth."
3,"A good ""who done it""","The review on the cover suggest that the book is ""gruesome""...it is not. I'm a fan of gore and gruesome so I was excited to give it a go. While the killer is termed ""The Headhunter"", the book does not give bloody details, at least not what I call ""bloody"". The storyline itsself is excellent. It took me a few chapters to really get into it, but once I did I enjoyed it a great deal. The ending was a true suprise to me and very unexpected."
5,Absolutely Incredible,"Ok. Every body knows that Flash 8/9 has now a better OOP than MX. Also, every body knows that Flash no longer use structures like movieClip.prototype etc.But what Robert Penner's books offers is a great explanation about Math and its possibilities in Flash. Vectors, 2D and 3D simulation with an elegant and well formed codes. This book opens a great land to be explored. With a important difference: now you have a brilliant GPS! :-)If you do not know how the stunning flash effects are made, get it. Every thing will be, after all, clear like water."
4,Did I forget to mention that I am a genius?,"You could get this info on a message board. It might take you a little while, but it would be free. It would be nice to have on hand, though. It's useful information.The post about real-world applications is a crock. If you work on projects and have at least half a brain, you'll be able to squeeze some of this code in somewhere. It may not be obvious at first so just keep at it.Caveat Emptor --You will gag on his egotistical rants. I did. He could've chopped that mess out and saved his readers some time and hidden the fact that he has a wooly mammoth ego."
4,great product,i used before and i will keep using it. it seems like before was better formula as it used to last longer but still does de job
5,Outstanding!,Aria is in the top 5 of my favorite CD's. It is a masterful blend of opera and contemporary beats. I highly recommend it.
3,Aria,"This CD had a few unique aspects, such as inserting part of an early 20th Century 78 rpm recording to introduce one of the pieces... with the sound of placing the needle on the record and the scratches. It worked very well. The idea of using various arias as a base for each piece and then improvising upon it was good listening. My one criticism, which I found annoying and impossible to ignore, was excessive use of a ""beat box"" in some of the pieces."
5,Absoloutly Beautiful!,"This is s gorgeous cd! The combination of techno, hip hop and classic opera is amazing. You are just taken away to another world and i love singing along to it. Great to sleep to or study or even paint to. You feel so relaxed. I cannot wait to hear the second cd. i heard its even better! defendtly buy it, if you love opera and techno then this is such a beautiful combination. ^_^"
5,Needs a Rain Forest and babbling brook to bloom,Have shared this with a few friends and now I can't keep up with requests to borrow it for a few evenings. Have reveled in it with cognac at home and with a hot toddy in the woods. Memorable as it melds with a variety of ambiances.
1,"Susch a great idea, such a waste of money",I did not enjoy this CD at all. I purchased it after reading all sorts of reviews about its charm and meditative wonder. I found instead that it was dull and cliched. Listening to the whole CD is painful. I do not recommend it to anyone.
5,"Awesome, concentrating, one-minded pieces","I listen to this CD almost everyday and can't tire of this. I came across this music being played in a mind,body, spirit store in Irving,TX and had to buy it immediately. I love it and recommend it to anyone who needs instant mellowing and focus. Thank you for this work"
5,Beautiful discovery,"A buddy of mine loaned me this CD and I won't give it back. Now and then I'll stumble onto a wonderful recording like this (reminds me of first discovering Tim Story or Gustav Holst) and explore everything ever done by the artist until I obsess on something new. ""Willow"" has one of the best builds in any track I've heard lately and ""Dido"" sets a mood that is at once dark and sensual. I'll buy Aria 2 today."
5,SPECTACULAR,If you like Deep Forest & Enigma then you won't go far wrong with this beauty. I've just come back from the States and heard one of the tracks off this album in a shop whilst browsing. It caught my attention straight away. Do not miss this..
5,A must buy,"This has been one of the best books I have read in grad school. Basically, it deals with the creation of the British Anatomy Act and with the criminalization of poverty. However, it's also got great info about grave robbing, murder for body-procurement, burial practices, and corpse decomposition - and it's extremely readable. Richardson explains that she began this book while reading Shelley's Frankenstein and with questions she had about the meanings of dissection and the body. This book is not about Frankenstein, but it's a must-read if you are to truly understand the society that Frankenstein was created for. It's also a must-read if you are at all interested in anatomy, poverty, or social policy dealing with anatomy and poverty."
5,"Really, really good!","Normally I hate white chocolate, but this stuff is so good-it's addicting. I've tried several of Graffiti Zoo's products & this one is one of my favorites."
4,It takes your blood pressure just fine.,"I don't have any back ground to accurately rate this. However, My wife for whom I bought it for seems to think it works fine. She is currently a nursing student. We need to get the middle of the road Sphygmomanometer, so it seems this is working just fine. She can take blood pressure with it."
3,Not what I was looking for,"Orthopedic Physical Assessment Enhanced EditionI was looking for a book that would define orthopedic abbreviations for me and would tell me the normals of orthopedic ROM tests, names and definitions of orthopedic tests used in examination, etc. This book was not it."
4,Havy Duty,"if you are using it for commercial purposesmake sure you get the air out before spinning it around the machine or whatever you're usingit gets really hard when it have air on it or water/paintother than that it's a hard worker hose.by the way! dont worry about keeping it clean, it would be impossible if you use it daily"
1,dont work,wont pull the paint on my rig at all its junk and all it is nothing more nothing less dont buy it wont work
3,Great Story with Some Major Flaws,"Empire of Bones starts out as a great concept, but the author lets herself slip by putting in some foreshadowing that is actually explicit information to the reader about what is to come. The last third of the novel loses momentum, and the ending is much too open and refuses to suggest answers to some major questions about self-determination and humankind's place in the Universe. Also, if the alien culture is so similar to India's and the Hindu religion, why didn't that culture become the dominant one on Earth? This is a wonderfully original story that loses power like a balloon running out of air. I wish I could rate it higher, but its flaws bring it down to a level of only above average."
4,I'm satisfied,"I recently purchased Wagner's 2000 PSI Wide Shot for a repainting project. The project is a large home built in the 20's. It took 15 gallons of base color paint, and 4 gallons of trim color. The Wagner has held up like a champ and made short work of the project compared to brushes and rollers.I read a previous review talking about worn parts on the sprayer. If you will adjust the paint viscosity to match the gauge included with the painter, you should have no problems. This was as simple as purchasing a can of ""additive"" for my paint, and stirring it in until it was the right thickness.Overall, I'm very satisfied with the painter, its ease of use, and its overall durability. This project was all detail work that couldn't be rolled and would have needed tedious brush painting. Thank you Wagner!"
4,Simplier job,My paint sprayer is working much better now. I have just not been completely happy with the entire system as I keep having problems getting it to work without problems. But when it does work correctly it works great.
3,not quite what it needs to be,"I found the book difficult to navigate.It does show many pictures but really misses the mark as far as information in regard to values and descriptions, the information was rather sketchy and incomplete in many areas."
3,"Rosenthal,Dining Services and Figurines","The book is not bad but isn't great either.The text is ok,the system of determining the year of production according to the mark is very good,but pictures do not include the best figurines,eg The girl with pearls, etc."
3,"Kind of bland - just ""okay""","I bought this book for my son's 7th birthday. It is obviously for a younger child - not to age 8, in my opinion. Although, I can't see that my son would have ever been thrilled with it, because the pictures are not very colorful.There isn't much of a story here, just mostly lists of creatures that you are supposed to locate on the pages...my son wasn't interested in having the story read to him a second time.I gave this story 3 stars for a child under 6...1 star for an older child."
4,Waiting for Vol. Two,"Rock Bottom Choir has a great sound and excellent production. In that sense it's a joy to listen to. Where it falls down is in the lyrics; they're practically inarticulate, while sung with a lot of passion. In that sense it reminds me of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club. Their take on the title track, however, is better than some rocked-up hymns I've heard. This album is really subtitled Volume One. With a really strong cover song on Volume Two, this band could easily have a charting hit."
3,The Bowery Boys with Leo Gorcey,Another good Bowery Boys movie! Leo Gorcey always murders the English language with his twisted words and phrases - one of the best parts of the Bowery Boys films. This movie is no exception!
3,good discussion of a seldomly analyzed topic,"The one serious drawback to this book is the lack of any serious discussion of the fictional work of Poppy Z. Brite. Even though the author's primary focus is film, Brite's work takes Anne Rice's one step further. It won't be long until there are efforts to translate her work into a filmic medium. The homoerotic/sexual impulse finds its expression throughout Brite's work."
1,A WORK OF GENIUS!!!,"This is the book that explains that CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON is really about homosexuality because...well you see the Gill Man's head is really a phallus. Got It?? And even though the Creature pursues Julie Adams thoughout the picture, he is REALLY interested in Richard Carlson, Richard Denning and the rest of the male crew which is why he keeps attacking them. Got it?? Adams is just a beard. Even though the Gill Man goes after Adams again and again, he is only trying to lure those men in the bathing suits to his lair so he can have his way with them.Got that?? And Denning and Carlson STAB the Creature with their knives and spearguns!!! Does one need go on?? Good. Thank God for tenure so we can have more works of SHEER genius..like this."
1,No refund as yet !!,"I found this product on the internet and after years of pain, especially in my feet, thought that I would try it. The product had no effect on my pain whatsoever and as the company offer a 90 day refund, I have just applied to them to refund the 5 bottles which I have bought.It may help for some people but it was a complete waste of time for me.15th December 2011I am still waiting for the refund. The company tell me now that I can only have a refund on the first order which was one bottle. If I was a running a reputable company I would not want to have so many dissatisfied customers.I am angry that I spent so much money and did not get any relief whatsoever. I will still be trying to get a refund but I feel that I have lost my money."
3,Incomplete Formula?,"I thought R-Lipoic Acid and L-Carnitine were being used to treat Neuropathy. A deficiency in some of the vitamins in this product could be a contributing factor but don't stop there, I don't believe this offers anything to relieve the pain. I have poly-peripheral neuropathy and I am searching for ways to get relief. There are some medications, but you have to cope with the side affects too...and I don't want to have to live with the nightmare that narcotics can cause. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Self Hypnosis appears to be the most affective. For those without affordable medical care, I have found several self help books and CD's on Amazon. It is a terrible disease but I'm not going to let it take my life from me. Wishing you the best."
2,tummy troubles,"I wonder if anyone has suffered with gastric problems since starting this nerve repair formula. I have stopped it to see if it is the source, but it coincides with the onset of medication. By the way, no real help with neuropathy, though I do receive the phone calls and emails telling me to do this and that and take a lot of pills. When I increased the pills, I had more pain."
4,AT LEAST THERE IS HOPE,"TWO MONTHS INTO A REGIME OF USE, I HAVE SEEN ENOUGH PROGRESS TOAT LEAST GIVE ME SOME HOPE FOR A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE. THE PAIN IS LESS,BURNING LESS, AND EVEN NOTICEABLE LESSENING OF NUMBNESS. I HAVE EVEN HAD DAYSWHEN I WENT HOURS FORGETTING I HAVE NERVE DAMAGED FEET. SO FAR, SOOO GOOD !"
3,These DO NOT work for everyone,"Bought these once directly from the company. Then, bought 3 more bottles through Amazon because with Amazon you got free shipping. They did absolutely nothing for my husband's peripheral neuropathy (as advertised). Also, one of their reviews on Amazon was put on there by their own company. What kind of a company does that?"
3,Maybe!,"I have been a victim of peripheral Neuropathy caused by statin drugs throughout the past several years. The discomfort, pain, and lack of control in my feet was becoming worse, so when I found WSN Nerve Support Formula I decided to try it. As yet, my relief is very little, but as my problem was very advanced I am going to continue the treatment for at least 3 months."
2,nerve support formula,This formula has not worked so far for my wife who has numb fingers on both hands.
2,Nerve Support Formula for Relief,"This is not the bad part:Purchased this for my in hope that it would work. But her pain is just overwheming that it's not working on her neuopathy. Okay so I at least tried and the money - well no problem like I said I tried.The bad part:Is that I did not approve of ""Amazon"" to give off my personal information to the Formula Company. Now I get several calls, to purchase more of their pills. I thought my purchase was secure and confidential. Now there is no telling what other info they sold or gave away that is mine.I surely will think twice about another purchase from ""Amazon"".This was to Help My Wife, not to be bothered by sells people or marketing dept.I'll make the call if I want to purchase more or not, I don't need someone calling me or reminding me of my responsibilities."
1,Total scam,"I tried this product for six months and like the others who reviewed it didn't get the desired results. As a matter of fact my symptoms seemed to worsen and when I requested a ""full"" refund they ignored me and actually tried to sell me other products. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
4,Sales Pitch is Intrusive..,"I must admit, I was skeptical as to the efficacy of any product I choose as a last-ditch effort to control an ailment for which there is no definitive cure. NSF made a believer out of me. The instances and intensity of non-diabetic peripheral neuropathy have greatly diminished. However, the barrage of letters, phone calls, and emails under the guise of ""checking in"" is intrusive. I was told that, by buying on Amazon.com instead of the product's website, I could circumvent the ""hard sell"""
1,No help at all,Have taken 4 capsules 3X per day for several months and there was absolutely no improvement in my peripheal neurapathy. I have stopped taking it.
5,"Nerve Support Formula for Relief of Peripheral, Diabetic & Poly Neuropathy Nerve Pain","This product is great for burning of the legs and the pain in the feet from diabetes. I would not be without it. My dr. told me to keep on using Nerve Support Formula for Relief of Peripheral, Diabetic & Poly Neuropathy Nerve Pain it as it has nothing in it to harm you.Nerve Support Formula for Relief of Peripheral, Diabetic & Poly Neuropathy Nerve Pain"
1,"False claims, all this is is Vitamin B & D","Yes, if you're suffering from neuropathy (I have post herpetic neuralgia), sure you do need more Vitamin B and D. But this formula doesn't have enough of either, and the fact that they make outrageous claims that it will stop your pain is incredible (under the Indications section here). There's nothing else in this thing but various forms of Vitamin B & D.I'm posting my comment as a warning that one should try to shop carefully. If this formula said it supported nerve healing by giving you a small dose of B & D, then it would be truthful. But for it to state it will relieve your symptoms is outrageous."
1,Nerve support formula,"I ordered this product because I suffer from problem with my nervous system.Unfortunately I have been ill since receiving the goods, my complaint is that I ordered that I ordered the goods through Amazon and paid 8 plus for shipping, I received a note from the Post Office stating that before I could get the goods I had to pay 11.45 for postage (this meant I was paying 19+ for goods that cost approx 25). I notified Amazon who said I should contact the supplier. I hav'nt bothered because I thought that as I had placed the order with Amazon they were the supplier and the onus for sorting out the problem lay with them. I will just stop using Amazon in the future and find myself a more understanding supplier."
2,Did not help at all.,"I don't feel any different, most likely won't buy again! I just lost out on $44 dollars in my opinion."
4,Great for leg pain,This really helped the RLS I have but I couldn't afford to continue buy it as I am only a limited budget. The price was a little steep.
1,Did not work for me,I went to two neurologists and was diagnosed with idiopathic neuropathy (do not know the cause). I am not a diabetic of any shape or form. I tried this product for 60 days and it did not seem to have any affect. This is not to say that it will not work for someone else. These people really gave me a hard sell by calling and sending e-mails. At first they say you should see results in 2 weeks. When it does not work then they say that sometimes it takes over 90 days to see results.I have to believe that this product is snake oil.
2,Wellness Support Network,"Nerve Support Formula Nutritional Supplement for Peripheral Neuropathy is a fair product. Customer support is extremely poor. We were on the automatic draft program and when we cancelled, they continued to send the product. We cancelled in September and they charged our account anyway even though we changed account numbers. We are still in dispute with this company."
2,Somehow Unsatisfying,"This book left me wanting. I hear a lot of rhetoric all the time about the positive aspects of ADD so I wanted some guidance on maximizing mine, and finding a good professional niche that would finally pull things together for me. This wasn't it.It is really just a collection of stories about people who have found unusual work. But almost all of the individuals ""fell"" into their solution. So the message is hang out until something falls into your lap? Not helpful.Other stories involved people who had advantages often not available to an ADD adult who has little money or education due to lack of treament -- due to little money -- due to lack of treatment -- due to little money....I would have liked to see more practical examples, showing why the solution was well suited for the particular ADD type, and how success was acheived step by step so that I can see some clear possibilities and, most importantly, realistic options as an ADD'er.Kudos for the positive approach though!"
2,Not worth the money,"Don't let the photo fool you, this table is not large enough for six chairs. It will only accommodate four. The ends don't overhang the base enough for another seat. The glass top is also much thinner and less substantial than I expected, and the general workmanship of the table is poor. The base was shipped with a large split right down the middle of one of the wood pieces but the seller is working with us to correct this. I'm certain the split did not happen in shipping because it was packed well and none of the three layers of boxes was damaged."
5,A Must Read,After Whiteness is a must read for anyone interested in the burgeoning field of Whiteness Studies. As the book jacket suggests it is ground breaking work and is eloquently written.
4,Good Buy,"I have been using many types of media for my dvd burner. This one works just fine as for budget DVD DL.The promised 2.4X is there and the recordings are flawless.Recommended for anyone not willing to spend a lot of money.Personally I'd recommend buying 25 pack, since the average cost per dvdis a lot less. Please remember to update your dvd burner drivers as from my experience it proved to be most important step. 4 out of 5"
5,Can't beat the price,You can't beat the price. You get two movies for the price of one. My 3-year-old daughter really enjoyed the newer version and wants to watch it all the time.
4,A cute modern story regarding Peter Cottontail,"It doesn't really tell the story that I remember about Peter Cottontail, but it's a cute little modern story about Easter bunnies with a few other characters. There are a few catchy tunes and my kids are entertained each Easter when they watch this. It's non-religious, so if you're looking for a true Easter story to share, this isn't it, but it's still a family safe video for the kids to watch."
5,Good tricycle for 3 & up,"I bought this for my 2 year old daughter for her birthday but even at the smallest settings she has problems riding it very well--she can reach the pedals but barely. However, she is small for her age. However, my 3 year old LOVES it and rides it constantly and I am getting him his own for Christmas. Great price."
5,What a Bargain!!,"What a great tricycle at any price! It is so sturdy and safe, unlike other trikes (radio flyer)it doesn't tip and it is not as intimidating as a two wheeler...my son is all over the place on it. I can't believe it is only $30.00 and all of the great things the other reviewers say about it are true!"
4,"Nice bike, but no traction","I bought this tricycle for my 3 year old based on the good reviews and word of mouth about Kettler bikes. I paid for assembly, so it is put together well and none of the issues that other reviewers reported. My only complaint is that there is not good wheel traction. My daughter cannot ride the bike up our driveway (not steep at all) because the front wheel spins with very little traction to it. I am hoping in time, wear and tear might add some traction ability....but not sure if this is just positive thinking. So I am disappointed with the purchase."
5,Good Trike,"It appears to be a fine trike. I purchased for my 18-month old son, and he absolutely loves his new ""car-car."" It seems to be a good fit, and I llike the way that he sits to the back instead of up high like a regular trike. I'm a little wary of it's durability (there is quite a bit of plastic in it, and I wish the tires were rubber -- not with just a rubber strip). Although, one of my 14-year-old son's friend's sat in it, and it didn't even squish down. EASY to assemble. I assembled it in about 10 or so minutes with the baby in it (he wouldn't get off). Instructions well organized and in English; hardware well organized. ... If it is truly durable, then I don't think you could get a better deal...."
5,Kid's Love To Peddle Away On This Classic Trike!,"This colorful tricycle is perfect for a toddler's first biking adventure. The trike is safe and sturdy, with a scratch resistant high-carbon steel frame and a very comfortable, adjustable high back seat. A big plus is that the tricycle won't wear out before your child does. It can be used for children up to five years-old. And the price is right!!I bought this for my cousin's son, who is 28 months. It took him a few hours to catch on to peddling, and then he was off and away, giggling the whole time. This toy provides a means for exercise and motor skill development - and hours of fun. I decided to buy this model after reading the reviews on Amazon for many different tricycles. He and his sister had been fighting over her bike, now they both want to ride this one. I am so glad that I made this choice, and so is my cousin and her son! The big sis wants one too, but she is ready for a two wheeler, with training wheels, of course.JANA"
4,What a pleasant surprise,"After a dissapointing go around with a radio flyer trike, we went out and bought this trike at toys r us. Great price at 19.99 on sale, so we figured why not. I feel the bike is built extremely well. The stearing is very easy, the wheels have a strip of rubber on the outside so its easier to move on pavement compared with plastic tires, and its oh so quiet. My favorite feature is that its very hard to tip. With our previous trike, it tipped with little effort, but this trike is very sturdy. I thought on the box it said 18 months and up, however on this site it says 24 months. Our son is 21 months and can reach the pedals but loses them slightly when they are at the furthest point when pedaling. To give you an idea he is 35 inches tall (tall for his age), so if your child is around this height, know it will be only a matter of months before they can reach everything. Im very pleased with this trike and for the money, you can't really beat it."
2,"the new model is made in china, not Germany!","we love our ORIGINAL Kiddio supertrike, that was made in GERMANY. We bought the original last year and our kids love it, so much that we went to buy another for little brother. What a surprise that the new model is only engineered in Germany, and now is slapped together in China. The new parts do not seem as rugged as the old (particularly the front fender thing). The seat is higher in back so my 2yr old can't get his leg over the seat like he can on the other (but still low enough that it is not comfortable to push). The seat is also sloped rather than scooped so the child is propelled forward.The price is more than last year, but still reasonable for a trike (it's good to 5 years tho my 4 yr old is too big). The wheel base is wide enough that it does not tip. My kids both refuse to ride the new one and fight over the old one still! Overall, I wish I had kept the box so I could return it!"
5,"Inspiring, accessible, and very usable spiritual information","The information for each pathway is only a few pages long (so you can read a short section with coffee in the morning), but it is packed with wonderful insights, inspiration, and most importantly ways to really use the information. Each pathway has a suggested meditation and ideas for integrating the concept into your life. Wonderful book!"
5,Great guide for understanding the Sufi tradition,This is an excellent guide for deepening ones understanding of the Sufi tradition. It also includes daily meditations. I'm really enjoying reading them each morning and find practical wisdom for daily life. I'm delighted it was recommended to me by Sufi friends.
5,A Universal Spirituality,"I found this book on Sufi spirituality really amazing. Although it obviously comes straight from the Sufi traditions, it is a book that can be used with immense profit by serious spiritual seekers from all faiths, and even for those with no faith."
5,Awe Inspiring,"This book has become a daily Oracle for me. Each pathway offers a rich perspective of life. It brings clarity and insight to each and everyday. My favorite is the pathway Assessing What Is.. how true it was for me especially in my life. We get so wrapped up in everyday drama that we forget the pathway of present moment. If offers so much heart energy. This book offers a pathway to inner peace and gives you the tools to travel this enlightened path. This was my first introduction to the Sufi tradition. I take this book with me everywhere.Susan Mavity, Author The Light Within, The Gift Of A Rose"
4,Nourishing blessed Names of Allah,"The Sufi Book of Life 99 Pathways of the Heart for the Modern Dervish, by Saadi Shakur Christi, is an enriching experience beginning with the Names of Allah in Arabic and expanding the translation to a myriad of interpretations and inspirational lights. There is so much to find about yourself within the pages of this mystical book that opens up the Quran to anyone who is fortunate and receives this inspiration. The chapters begin with a name of God, and open up other meanings to ponder, bringing the seeker into a deeper reflecion and meaningful insight about ordinary experience. Somehow the concept of an oracle holds true with this book if you are led to it or gifted with this, as it is based on the names of God. I already like if not love this book, and I have only had it for a couple of days."
3,Strength in writing,This book is a great way to gain a different outlook on situations that you may be having trouble dealing with. It is really well written and the direct translation of the names is an added bonus. It has certainly helped me get perspective on many things in my life.
1,I used it for the wrong reason,I read some reviews that it was good to make the hair grow but it my hair fall out alot!!!!
4,Bill Richardson on Iraq,"This book describes the Davos scene in winter. Davos, in case you have not received your invitation yet, is where the elite meet on an annual basis to discuss the mega-issues facing mankind. More precisely, it's where buyers (banks) and sellers (governments) come together to discuss investment possibilities -- risk and reward. That's all fine, and Lapham's description of the event strikes me as reasonably accurate. But here's the reason to look at this slim book. Take a look at the pages wherein Bill Richardson, then the US Secretary to the UN, describes Saddam Hussein and the threat posed. For a minute, forget that you are reading about views expressed during the Clinton Administration. Remarkably consistent argument across Administrations. In Richardson's words, ""He's asking to be bombed."""
3,The Agony of Mam-yawn,"The Agony of Mammon is Lewis Lapham's account of his field trip to the 1998 WEF at Davos. As a book based around a subject as complex as global economics, it is pleasantly short and readable. One strong point of the book, for me anyways, is that Lapham doesn't ever seem to make his human research subjects-the participants of the WEF- into unwitting caricatures of themselves by typing them as selfish monsters who recklessly control the majority of the worlds resources in an effort to achieve domination. That is, until one reads the satirical glossary at the end of the book.Certainly not engaging, but overall a digestible, refreshing, mostly non-partisan glimpse into the hopelessly social aspects of a particular event which anyone reading this review will probably never ever participate in."
2,Too short & not too sweet,I was expecting more quotes to let me get a feel on what it was like to be there. Most of what was said in the book I could've guessed for myself without ever having stepped foot in Davos.
3,Dixon Beginners Yellow Elementary Pencil,"Arrived promptly, but the pencil leads have broken on several of the pencils. I sharpened and tried again, but continued to break leads so I had to throw them away."
5,Great for little hands!,"My son's school recommended these pencils for childrenentering 1st grade. I am so glad I was able to find them,I really think they are what those little hands needto get them on the path to writing!! Very easy to gripand the erasers work well!!"
1,Do not buy this,"1. The covers and center plug do not fit well at all. It is very hard to get the circle plug to stay. It pops out very easily. It gets very frustrating for the children when they are trying to fill the geometric shapes with something heavy like water or beans and it keeps falling out.2. The box arrived with good packaging....but, some of the shapes arrived already chipped or cracking...as if it was a manufacture problem...not something that happened during transit. I dont think the pieces are very sturdy. Its made with cheap plastic.3. The edges on each shape are very sharp. Be careful if you are buying for smaller kids.I would not recommend this product, it is not worth the money. Try finding a different brand. I usually love learning resources stuff...but not this one."
3,The geosolids don't close well,"The geosoilds look like any other product. However, the little lids that are supposto lock the sand inside to measure the mass or volume do not close well. And in some figures it doesn't close at all. If you only need them to show students the parts of a solid figure (vertex, edge, face, etc...) then fine but not for volume or mass."
5,Big River Big Man: Never heard of it. I Loved it !!!!,"Big River, Big Man is an epic adventure that spans a continent and 3 generations; a human drama with all the ingredients: greed, benevolence, poverty, wealth, strength and weakness. Love stories and friendships burn and die against a backdrop of the 19th century logging industry, the Civil War, and the vast raw wilderness of a young United States. Jim Buckmaster, the hero of the story, overcomes childhood tragedy to build an unimaginable empire. He wants for nothing.....except a trusting friend and love. Thomas Duncan pulls the reader into this, one of those ""I can't wait to find out what happens next"" stories; one of my favorite 5 fiction novels ever."
5,Excellent,"There was such an immediate difference between this cleaner vs the regular standard formula. This is something to do at least on a monthly basis to reduce allergens in the house. I still would prefer the basic stain removal formula for tough stains and spills. Overall, we love this product and it helps significantly with our family allergies."
3,Almost but not quite,"It starts out really good then peters out midway on. Why is it that whenever Bob is about to go in depth about a particular subject, the filmmakers cut to him performing? How could they not address the Wailers break up? I mean they literally ignore it. Isn't the break up as significant as them getting together in the first place? Did Marley's music regress, progress or stagnate after Bunny and Peter left? How did Bob feel about Bunny and Tosh leaving? And what happened to Bunny anyway? You see him early on and then you don't see him again. Since he's the only one alive of the three, doesn't his opinion have more weight than most. All I'm saying is the audience would have gotten an even better understanding of Marley with more Bunny and more Tosh."
5,BOB MARLEY @ HIS BEST,"THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST BOB DVD,VIDEO I HAVE SEEN,AND IF YOU ARE A FAN OR JUST WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE GREAT REGGAE KING THIS IS THE PURCHASE TO MAKE. NOT A LOT OF MUSIC VIDEO CLIPS,BUT YOU GET TO HEAR BOB TALK ABOUT LIFE,BUT MOST OF ALL WHAT PEOPLE MEANT TO HIM. REBEL MUSIC IS THE TRUE STORY OF THE MAN I CALL MY HERO,ROBERT NESTA MARLEY.""ONE LOVE"""
3,Good but not the best,"This is a good bio of Bob Marley but it still lacks real insight into his life and career...it doesn't break any new ground and the story is told better by Bob himself on the video ""Time Will Tell"" and by people who knew him on ""Caribbean Nights: The Bob Marley Story"" Hopefully, these will get re-issued on DVD as I think they are far superior. As one previous reviewer noted, there is virtually no Bunny and no Tosh. I did find the interviews with the former CIA Agent interesting. All in all, not bad but not the best."
4,"Jamaica, his people","The life of Bob Marley is told by the people that lived in and were a part of his life.The video and narration further establishes the fact of his love and hope for his fellow Jamaicans and his country.My son (16) and I watched and we both came to the same conclusion of how disappointed we are, we would never witness a Marley concert or feel the passion of his live voice singing his message to his family.After visiting the country of Bob Marley, the amazing island of Jamaica for the third time, it is easy to see and understand why his passion and prophetic ways absorbed these people.The country has the most authentic and open personalities of any nation we have been to in our travels.This DVD gives a small but in depth look at a man that tried to keep his country unified and moving forward with music and song, he did it!One Love is a total overveiw of what Bob was and is trying to say."
2,Disappointed,Very amatuerish. Could have been so much more. Get another pure documetary.Picture quality poor.
4,Works Great,"I began using Black Cohosh by Sundown Naturals several years ago. My pharmacy has stopped carrying it and I've had a hard time locating in other pharmacies as well. I've tried other brands of Blach Cohosh and they don't seem nearly as effective. A great homeopathic way to address the challenges of menopause including hot flashes and raging emotions. Great price, delivered promptly!"
3,one broke,"A first-quality feeling tool set with good selection of sizes in flat blade but leaves some smaller and medium Phillips sizes still needed. No punch, no corkscrew hole-starter.The P3321 smallest flat blade broke. Not inordinate pressure and half of the small blade fractured, indicating bad metal. If it has simply deformed, then likely too much pressure was put on, but this one fractured.Difficult to replace any one driver or to fill out the set with two more drivers, where there is room in the plastic case."
3,"Great Aerobics, Poor warmup & cooldown","When you start playing this tape, you're going to wonder if you got the wrong tape. The warm up is by someone other than Donna, and is just wierd. There's no talking -- no instructing on the correct way to do anything, and it's the same moves over and over. And I certainly wasn't warmed up by it. Then Donna comes on and leads you through some high energy, interesting aerobics. And when she's through, you simply stop. No cool down. You go right into a yoga stretch with another woman who talks for a while before it even starts. The exercise just ends too abrubtly, with no chance to truly cool down."
2,Not a full workout,"I found the warm up to be horrible, I wasn't sure exactly what I was watching or what I should be doing, and it made no sense. There was no cool down session after jumping around and performing ""Attitude Aerobics"". You certainly have to have some form of an attitude to do this tape. I found the music dated, and it did not motivate me to want to continue execerising. The moves are done at a quick speed and are repetitive, also you are not sure what exercise is supposed to work which body part. I own other tapes by Donna Richardson that I truly enjoy, however this tape was not quite the workout I was hoping for."
1,disappointed,"I'm glad I only borrowed this one from the library! The aerobics segment lasted less than 20 minutes, not even long enough to get breathless and break a sweat."
2,This video is hard to follow and the music is dated,This video is hard to follow because she moves very quickly and the camera is not always at a good position for someone viewing the video to follow. The music is dated.
1,"Junk, Junk, Junk!","I have always been a fan of HP but they certainly do not support their all-in-one products. They are so caught up with their fancy photo printers, these office machines are tossed aside. The fax machine rarely works, if I see the error ""paper-mismatch"" one more time I'm going to puke! I've called tech support and all they do is refer me to the website troubleshooting guide. I tried to explain I already followed that to no avail, but our English to Pakistani wasn't working so well. This one is going in the trash, I'm getting a Canon."
2,3 years and $300.00,I have always been a loyal HP user. The 6110 lasted three years and then took a dive on me. Over the last year I have had to deal with the fax freezing up constantly. The printer has worked well but today I have permanent failure with my scanner thus not allowing me to use any of the all in one functions. $100.00 per year plus all the cost on ink. It was OK but I think I will try another brand.
3,Not what I thought it would be,"I purchased these socks/booties so that I could walk in rocky beach and water in French Polynesia where it is mostly volcanic surrounding waters. When I received it I was disappointed with the bottom of the bootie as it doesn't have any protection except a stamped on (think ""silkscreen"" or applique"") faux-looking sole. Basically, it is 100% neoprene which would tear or wear in the circumstances I would have put them in so I returned them. If you are looking for something to protect your feet from sand or to keep them warm in chilly water - these are for you."
2,"Wonderful vocals, but too predictable-sounding","The vocals are great- their voices are a joy to hear. However, I find the muisc itself, and the lyrical patterns to be too predictable. There are no hidden corners, nor unexpected chords sequences....On ""Alabina"" itself, it sounds pop,and 'cute', while their voices are magnificent-they don't seem to go together. There are some exotic and unique elements in their music, but it doesn't seem to me that they have been taken far enough- the group seems to be teetering between the 'easily-accepted' music, and the 'uniquely outstanding'."
5,"expressively exciting, mixes cultures exquisitely",This cd is wonderful! Not your usual Latin menu. Alabina mixes middle Eastern and Spanish rhythms and vocals expertly. You feel there!
2,too much of the same,"Alabina sound a lot like the Gypsy Kings, with the additional female voice adding a little bit extra. This mixture of Spanish music and Middle Eastern vocals is quite nice for one or two songs, but the CD as a whole is too boring to listen to because the songs sound so much alike."
5,Energetic! Cross Cultural.,You cannot go wrong with this CD! It is truly one of a kind. The mix of Spanish and Arabic Lyrics are hypnotic and will have you up and dancing. I have let all my friends listen to it and they have their own copy. Even my English speaking friends love it! Another great CD is Gypsy Passion (a compilation of various artists).
5,Alabina is great,This is my husband's favorite CD. He owned it at one time and lost it. I thought I'd surprise him by ordering it for him. She really is a great performer and the music is wonderful. Even though I don't understand the words I truly enjoy listening to this CD.
2,deceiving as may not appear,"as good as it looks the material of this bag is cheap, i didnt have the bag that long mostly for 3 months to 6 months the back of the sling was falling apart."
3,No images,"El libro tiene muy buen contenido, pero faltan imágenes para ayudar a reconocer las distintas especies"
3,Good for seeing some of Tesla's inventions but poor quality transfer from VHS and a bit boring.,"I just viewed this 50 minute long DVD and found it kind of boring but useful regarding seeing some of Tesla's actual inventions at work and some of the real documents, by and about him, displayed. It also shows the inside of the Tesla museum in Belgrade. The PBS Tesla documentary, Tesla - Master of Lightning, is much more interesting and goes much deeper into Tesla's life (it's much longer in duration). As well, this DVD is a poor quality transfer of the VHS tape; it has video dropouts and missing pieces, similar to what happens when a film has damaged sections chopped out, causing jump cuts where some information is lost. I cover Tesla at the beginning of a course I teach about information technology and, along with the PBS Tesla documentary, will use brief segments of this DVD to further illustrate Tesla's inventions and importance; past, present and future."
2,Poorly produced and boring,This video is a poorly produced and edited string of facts glorifying Tesla's accomplishments. I love watching documentaries but even I have to admit that this one is a snoozer.
5,If You Really Want to Know about Teslas Death,"Here is what you do :First go to the Richard Syrett Talk show audio archives.http://www.richardsyrett.com/audioarchive.htm2nd : then search for May 9, 2007 and listen to Who Murdered Nikola Tesla and Why?Then go here and look at the article and pics, then decide for yourself.search google for : Bush Tesla and go to proliberty link page.http://www.proliberty.com/observer/20070405.htm"
1,Cheaply done,It had some interesting facts but it was put together with drawings. I bought two others that were wonderful. The one buy Orson Welles was great. The otheone I don't have in front of me. I think I am going to send this back. I am disappointed.
3,TESLA THE HUMBLE MAN,"The vedo was okay, but did not have the back stabbing I've seen in other video's by Tom Edison or GE . Did not have his idea of ray gun weapons, or atrocities done by Thomas Edison to down grade alternate current . Or the lack of education and limited english of Nicole Tesla . I had lost these video's over the years and would have liked this spicific information replaced for various reasons. Or the lost documentation of his ideas that was in a hotel vault where he lived. This video was generic to say the least. So much for a man who could put Albert Einstein to shame .........."
2,Dumb action plot,"Of sub-mediocre entertainment value. Watched it once, Hope I won't watch it again. What ever for?! Farfecthed. Poor humor. Should have resisted ordering it."
3,Different,"It's a little slow; but, picks up a little towards the end. If you like Dempsey or Judd, you'll probably like the movie."
3,Just killing time to watch,"Good actors, far less script than they are worthy of. Often I buy for others, not this one too dull and drawn out without reason"
3,Not too bad!,"I laughed...out loud and quite a few times as a matter of fact, so I think it was worth watching!"
1,Sooooo NOT worth it!!,"If you have a smidgen of intelligence this movie will be sure to insult it. The stupidest characters + a stupid script = a complete waste of time. [And I'm an Ashley Judd fan but I sure wouldn't buy her facial products based on how she looked through this movie.]Yes, there IS a little bit of a surprise at the end of the movie that will make some idiots think this was a real ""smart"" movie - but they'd be wrong, and getting to that surprise end is just soooo NOT WORTH IT."
4,Flypaper,Both my husband and I saw this movie some time ago. We thought it one of the strangest and funniest little movies we had seen in a long time. I purchased the movie for my husband as a gift.
1,Save your money,"My copy ended up in the trash. There are so many typos, grammatical errors and mismatches between the examples and the software, that I should have returned it for a refund. It reads like a rough draft of what could be a book. And to the good people at ""Dummies"", PLEASE use a proofreader next time."
3,My considered opinion in the short time I have had to review.,"Whilst I am still reading through this book I find the 3D coverage limited, a little more detail in this area would be an improvement."
1,This book was a fustrating waste of my time and money,"As an absolute beginner I naturally purchased this 'for Dummies' book in the assumption that I would be guided through Autocad in the simplest form possible.But alas no, this book immediatly immersed me in confusion and fustration. With no precise step by step guides or no simple tutorial exercises, the author Mark Middelton has no business teaching to beginners.He then has the audacity to give himself a five star review on this review page, and whine about any criticism of his book.I suggest he reads Cheryl R Schrocks 'Exercise Workbook for Beginning Autocad' to experience a true professional teacher in action."
4,AutoCad Review,This is a great book for beginners of AutoCad. It takes you step by step through the the most basic operations to the more complex ones. Great book.
2,AutoCad 2004,"If you know something about Autocad save your money, this book is not for you. I bought this book because of the major changes from R3.3 to 2004. Hoping it would cover the new ways to Xref, plot, and so on. It does not, the book gives the broadest overview on these subjects if they get covered at all. To sum it up if you've never used AutoCad before then the book might be worthwhile to you. If you have any previous knowledge of Cad this book will not help much."
2,Blu-Ray applications - non-existent,"I bought this machine primarily for home video processing with the new Blu-Ray technology and using HDV at 1080i. I have a Sony camcorder that records in 1080i and I bought Sony Vegas + DVD Platinum edition to edit the videos and burn to the Blu-Ray. Sony Vegas refuses to support burning to a Blu-Ray so, it remains a useless and expensive feature for now. Sony's various branches do not work well together and each sends you off to the other for support issues. Skip it, wait for Apple's version to come out."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"The third of these authorised sequels, and this one improved a bit, capturing a little more of the feel and ambience, I think.Having a cool owl probably doesn't hurt, either. That is part of the focus of the story, is there a real bird of prey still around, or not? This is what has to be discovered as the inhabitants and focal characters of this novel continue to not have a good time at all."
4,Great Face Design,"The first one i ordered (with a white strap) got lost in the mail, but Amazon did replace it with this black version. The watch's neoclassic face is what attracted me. The EcoDrive battery is what got me to buy it. I only had the second one for a year (I lost it!) but no problems with the battery once it got charged. I bought another watch - same style - from another vendor, since Citizen discontinued it and Amazon ran out of it.Citizen should keep this style or make a similar one, preferably with a choice of band colors - red or gray would be nice. I haven't seen anything new that compares to this design, which is a shame. The only negative is its face is a bit bulky for my wrist. It should be somewhat smaller."
5,Don't have to sharpen as often,"My students are so awful with pencils that I had to come up with a better solution. These pencils won't break like a regular #2 pencil. Also, it helps my students with motor skill control."
2,Screen not bright,"I have been a thinkpad owner / enthusiast for many years. This system in general is solid. My biggest complaint is that the screen is very dim when on battery. Even when you adjust the powersettings in XP and in the bios for battery only mode to be the highest, it still is very dim on battery. I have owened a couple t60 and t61 laptops in the past and personnaly this is the worse screen out of them all. Also this is the noisest of them all. Don't expect good support from Lenovo. Their policy is a 10 business day turnaround on repairs. All repairs go to independent service centers. (not IBM). I have already had my in service (after 3 weeks of use) and I am still waiting for it to come back. If you call the help line they will tell you it takes 2 business days to get someone to get back to you with more details on the ETA for the servicing. (Not great service)."
1,An illicit pamphlet held together with staples.,"How can this flimsy pamphlet begin to be described as a ""book"" when it comprises a couple of dozen or so poorly printed pages with a couple of staples holding it together? Then there is the matter of copyright theft. Some text and pictures are clearly stolen without any credit given to the copyright owners. The source of the stolen text is Sean Manchester's excellent hardback edition ""The Highgate Vampire"" that Amazon does not list, but is very much in print and still selling exceptionally well. How do I know? Because I am the book's managing editor! If you want to read the legitimate account, and not an illicit rip-off in pamphlet form, order ""The Highgate Vampire"" from Gothic Press, PO Box 542, Highgate, London N6 5FZ. ISBN 1872486010."
3,Tight fit,They seem smaller than the size in the ad. I wear a size 9.5 and these socks are a 9-13 and they seem tight on me.
5,Get these socks if you care about your feet!,"I heard about Thorlo socks from a friend so decided to try them. They are fantastic! Very comfortable and warm and wick moisture away from my feet. The best thing is they don't bunch up when I'm wearing my boots all day. They are a bit toasty in hot weather but the comfort is worth it to me. I have size 11 feet and bought size 13-15 socks - I'm too lazy to wash them separately, they shrunk in the first wash and now fit perfectly!!"
4,Good product.,"I like the feel of these, they are a little high on the leg for me but overall good quality."
2,Pretty boring,"This was a pretty slow-moving film for my taste. I thought they really glossed over the troubles that would be inevitable with this kind of situation. This premise- a loved one coming back from the dead- was done MUCH better in ""Always"" and also in ""Truly, Madly, Deeply"". This seemed like just kind of a dumb movie, and could have been done so much better."
5,"Charming, Sentimental, Quirky","Although the premise of cryogenics is a little hard to swallow, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie for its message ""Love endures"". The actors carry the day, the entire ensemble pulls this off admirably. Especially Wimmer and Berg. I have seen it no less than eight times and am touched each time. A fine cast, wonderful performances and a touching tale, what more could you ask for in a movie?"
5,"good , fun and clean entertainment","Late for dinner, was a movie, I rented for my sister and I to watch,one evening, she and I needed to spend some sister time together, and this movie was great, it made us laugh and cry and cheer, we both enjoyed it so much. As Valentine gift for a friend, I started looking for it, in DVD format, but could'nt find it, and on top of that none of the video stores in my area, did'nt even have it to rent any more, so thank you Amazon, for having what I was looking for."
5,An absolute timeless classic!,"This is an awesome movie that I actually saw in the theatre when it was first released. I actually owned a VHS version of the movie but it was poor quality and I was soooo hoping that they would release a DVD version and finally after all these years, here it is. If there's ever a movie to own, this is it! A well written, well directed love story that actually has a very simple plot, but the story is told so well and the actors are superb in delivering their performances. All this put together and you have one of the greatest love stories in movie history. 5 stars is a no brainer, it really deserves 6 stars. It's one of those movies that got lost in the shuffle amidst all these big budget hollywood movies. This is a ""feel good"" movie that everyone should see about two men frozen in time and come back to find out that life and the world has changed over 20 years later! I highly recommend this movie. You won't be disappointed."
5,Late for Dinner,This is a wonderful movie. Made me laugh and cry. I rate it 5 because it was a good clean movie.
5,Unforgettable Romantic Comedy,"A young family man (Brian Wimmer) and his brother-in-law (Peter Berg) are a couple of good guys who stumble into a bad situation. After a few twists and turns, they end up cryogenically frozen, only to return nearly three decades later to try to reclaim their lives. Wimmer gives an outstanding performance in trying to woo and win back his now much older wife, and Berg is incredible as a chronically ill (and amusingly child-like) young man. Marcia Gay Harden is also excellent as the bewildered wife, and there are many other solid supporting characters.The film is great entertainment for nearly all ages and tastes. It is funny and sincere, and will leave you with a smile on your face. This is one movie that you will want to OWN. Once you have seen it, you will want to watch it again and again, and share the experience with others. Late for Dinner is a movie that you will never regret and never forget."
5,Impressed by the quality,"OK, the movie is lovely, an old favorite, which has never come out on DVD.I hadn't tried the ""manufactured on demand"" videos before and was a bit concerned, seeing how some of those aftermarket videos are produced, but this is pretty close to DVD quality.No special features, but you know, that's not a bad thing when you consider the trade off is that you pop the DVD in, and the movie starts playing.Video and sound quality are much better than I expected."
4,Mediocre for the first 45 minutes . . . but then the last 45 make it worth watching.,"I was disappointed in this flick for the first 45 minutes as it was a typical get frozen and wake up after 30 years formula, but then the last half made up for it in original dialogue and heart touching comedy.It could have been 5 stars if the first half was as good as the second. The appearance of Joy and Jessica Husband, the wife and daughter of Willie (the character which shoots the gardener) brings life into the flick in the second half.Stick with the film through he first 45 minutes and you won't be sorry."
3,Sound system.,The recording of this concert is not good. Sound system were intermittent. I expect it to be a enjoyable Live Concert.
1,Awful Stuff!,"Candied Calabrian tangerine covered in pure dark chocolate 200 g.This is just a terrible tasting product. The chocolate is waxy and tasteless. The fruit is not sweet; it is chewy and tough. Total product is tough and tasteless, a huge disappointment. And at this price?! Ach!"
4,I agree with [previous reviewer],"... I have been studying Real Estate for about a year and I was always a little confused by all the different information concerning foreclosures , REOs, etc., and this book is helping to clear it all up. It's probably due to the way the author takes you through the different scenerios with actual examples. To teach it this clearly he obviously knows what he's doing. At [money] in the bookstore it's a bit pricey, but at the discounted Amazon price, I think it's a must have! ..."
4,Magnifico,"Este libro es magnifico para aquellos que todavia estan en la oscuridad sobre the vida despues de la mierte. Yo perdi a mi mama en 2005 y tuve muchas dudas...hay un cielo...estara feliz. Despues de leer este libro, me senti mas calmada...con paz. Albom pinta un cielo aceptable para todos...el cielo depende de lo que uno considera el cielo. Para mi mama, es un lugar donde te vistes elegantemente and vas a lugares a compartir risas, amistad, etc...esto es lo que hacia mi mama feliz y el cielo es el lugar donde estas completamente feliz. Albom nos muestra una vida despues de la muerte aunque en forma de cuento. Mi unica critica es el principio del libro que camina lento pero uno tiene que tener paciencia para llegar a lo bueno"
2,Linda historia pero...,"Linda historia, aunque esta edicion en español no es muy buena, ya que el libro tiene no menos de 10 errores gramaticales."
4,Good headset,"This headset gives very good sound, but I had problems with the direction the sound came from. Fiddling with the volume, the sound can either come in just one ear or both, so I had to play around with it until I got a reasonable volume and sound in stereo. The microphone works great and has no problems."
2,Tea Strainer cut by saw. Cracked.,"I wanted a non-metal, non-plastic tea strainer. This set was a nice idea. Unfortunately the slits at bottom of the glass strainer that let water flow in/out seemed to be cut by some kind of small saw after the glass is hardened, rather than formed in the glass making process. So the edges of the strainer slits look rough. One wonders if tiny glass particles/dust will break off into your tea over time. I didn't need to wonder long as large cracks developed between some of the slits after several weeks of use. The strainer is now useless.The glass mug/lid are nice. Very lite. Not worththe full price of the set though."
5,Interesting ideas,"I bought this book because I had to do a paper on this author for my Psychology class. I learned a great deal from writing the paper and this book is by far my favorite one that I bought to do the paper. His ideas are interesting and humorous as well. I still remember certain parts of this book after having read it about 3 years ago so thats a plus. Sometimes in my conversations with others I bring up some of his points that really do make a lot of sense and are very enlightening. I really thought I would be bored reading a book such as this but it was not boring at all, I had a lot of fun doing this paper. Did I get a fabulous grade on the paper? No, but the fact that I learned a lot was enough of an advantage for me."
3,Its OK,"This an ok raft it was fun but it is not very durable.Me and my friend took it out to a creek, next thing you knowone of our shoes ripped a hole in the raft"
5,What does it mean to be faithful,"This book was a great influence to me as a young woman in the early seventies. Capon's wonderfully uplifting approach and sense of humor really bring home what our relationship with God should be. And he brings us home to the happy ending like the fairy tale from whence the title. No, God won't start your car for you, but He will sit with you in a snowbank and hold your hand. No one had ever before suggested to me the romantic nature of God's love for his creation."
2,okay,"The cd arrived in a timely manner.However, the cd was primarily made up of songs sung by unknown artists, not the original artists."
3,This is a must have,This book along with the devotonal are must haves if you are a person ofPrayer and intercessiory prayer. Hear the Father speak to you.
3,Cute but dim!,"I bought this to go with the rest of the kids line lady bug nursery set. It is really cute, admittedly a bit large. But it is dim! I was hoping it would be bright enough to create enough light so that I could safely walk in her room to nurse her. It's a bit too dark to do that!"
5,Kids Line Lady Bug,"Very cute. I like the product and I use it every night when I put my daughter to sleep. In my opinion, the Kids Line lady bug is by far the nicest lady bug design out there.It may be a bit bulky for some (but this does not botter me) and when the light is on there are some visible streaks on the red painted portion but it's not bad. Still overall a I give a 5* rating for the product."
1,clip ons,when snaping on the digital concepts 1.5x telephoto it broke off my lense top of my canon sd 550. I am not even sure if it can be repaired or if it is worth the cost.
3,"Ambitious title, limited content","I read the book a year ago. It is not totally bad, but the perspective is not global at all, merely European and focusing on political aspects, not on social, economic, or any other factor. Given its title, I was disappointed (with a more humble name, it would be a fine book)."
4,BossDavit,"The 4 star rating is not reflective of the groups performance. That said, the 4 stars were given for the video quality and the sound quality. I love Collective Soul and would liked to have seen a little better tweaking of the sound and video production of this DVD. Not being an engineer, I still know that this production could have been done better. The children in the orchestra were outstanding and made this production extremely enjoyable. Collective Soul has such a remarkable writer and singer in Ed Roland and wonderful musicians in his brother Dean on rhythm guitar, Will Turpin on bass, and masterful lead guitar in Joel Kosche. I love listening to Collective Soul while traveling in my vehicle. Now I can come home and enjoy them even more on my t.v. My wife now enjoys them as much I do. I have been listening to them for several years and now my wife actually can see what they look like. She and I are fans for life. Get this DVD, sit back and enjoy a great concert."
2,Wish I was there,"This is an O.K. concert on dvd, but really the sound quality blows. It was probably a great concert live, but don't expect much with this disk. I would suggest the 7 year itch cd instead."
5,Collective Soul Home DVD,This is a great concert DVD.Collective Soul the #1 radio airplay band of the 90's shows why in this show.A great rock band paired with the Atlanta Youth Symphony Orchestra.Acoustically and visually impressive a must have for the Collective Soul fan.
1,would not play,"this blue ray would not play on my system ( which is one year old ) this is not the first time. the Clapton ""Crossroads benefit"" would not play either. It is not worth messing around returning.. but i will no longer buy Amazon Blue - Ray movies.. i think they are imported junk !"
2,Disappointing production,"I'm not a hard core Collective Soul fan, but I admire them enough to own several CDs. I also own the ""Music in High Places"" dvd, which I was very impressed with. I decided to buy this dvd based on the excellent customer reviews. However, in my opinion, the large concert hall format is distracting from the real talent of the band. The orchestra, instead of adding to the live experience, left me with a feeling of chaos and dilution. Collective Soul is a talented group of men, but their talent is not evident in this production. The ""Music in High Places"" dvd showcases their excellent musicianship and vocal abilities that this production manages to completely cover up. For a more casual fan, I would not recommend this dvd for an introduction to the band. You just might be fooled into thinking Collective Soul has no talent."
2,Dont buy this DVD!,"Dont buy this DVD. Not very good. But Music in High places is smoken hot! Its unplugged Collective Soul. Wish they made a CD of it. Saw Collective Soul on TV 6 months ago playing at an outdoor venue live. That was really smokin hot too! But this DVD? Too many cooks in the kitchen and it didn't have the ""collective soul"" or essence they play. Guess you had to be there."
3,A good start.......,"I prefer the books penned under her pseudonym Gaston (or is it vice versa) In any regards if this is a first novel then I am willing to say that that this is a great effort, for I've read far worse from seasoned authors.Other reviewers have already related the plot so I will forgo the rundown of it.I'm happy I started with her more recent novels (The mysterious Miss M, A reputable Rake and The wagering Widow) all of which were EXCELLENTLY written and showed exciting promise of what to expect from this great author.The storyline in this case was great, the plot realistic, but it fell flat along the way.Again this was a new novel from her earlier work and I'm too aware of that fact to give this novel lower than three stars. It is an awesome effort, and Ms Gaston/Perkins is one of those authors I'm guaranteed to get my money's worth out of.I'm therefore looking forward to reading more of her work."
5,"An unexpected way to start, to say the least.","I simply love the characters. They have depth and all the complexities that make people interesting, and not just the main characters but the secondary characters as well. They all seem so real, and I want to know more about them. The children captured my heart! And there are scenes that are simply priceless throughout. The story was rich with details, like the still room, where flowers are dried, and the nitty gritty of running an estate. I'm looking forward to more books from Diane Perkins/Diane Gaston."
2,Did we read the same book?,"The lovers bickered through the entire book, were about the most unlikable pair I've ever read. I could barely finish this book. The only interesting relationships were those that the adults had with the kids, which were warm, loving, and genuine. I'd miss this one."
5,Just as described,"Fits, Wagner brand as described. Works great.Not sure what else I can say about this, except don't try to run your paint sprayer without this filter. Lots of stuff can make it through the pump that will clog the nozzle."
5,Wagner filters,Good product. These block fine particles and can be re used if they are cleaned well enough. A A A
3,Works quite well,"This camera worksWith ideal conditions, the camera can capture very impressive HDV footage,but with less light... it can be, well... not so goodI got this camera for home use, I own professional Sony HD cameras, so Sony is always my top choice.For home use, its okNote: The deck transports are very good for a camera this cheap, and the lens is above average.see ya!f3"
3,So-so...,"Good design, but I was disappointed with picture quality. Not as sharp as HD content is supposed to be, just a bit better than a DVD. Noticeable noise in low light conditions. The 2.1 megapixel matrix is obviously not sufficient. HDR-HC7 makes a better choice, but I haven't tried it yet."
4,Good Addition for the Angel Fan,"This actually wasn't what I expected, but it was pretty good anyway! It's not a paperback book but a comic, so if you're a fan of the show and comics/graphic novels, you'll enjoy this one!"
3,ok for some people,"I can envision this being very useful for some people. For me, I couldn't maintain it because the pressure was too much as it kind of dug into my skin (I'm heavy). So best for thin people, I'd say."
2,"Poor Glossary/Index, Very vague","This book is abysmal. I have used it this semester for an ""Art of Listening to Music"" course. The glossary is a whole 4 1/2 pages for a 500 page book; it includes maybe half of the vocab in the book. The index is even worse. It may have the term you are looking for, but the chances are it will not refer you to the context you want it in. I also found this book to be very vague over all. This could be for one of two reasons. First it's an introductory book, secondly I'm a math major and I demand very thorough proofs. However, neither of these reasons are an excuse for not defining a word that is only used in the musical world (Scherzo for example. The book uses it throughout, yet never says anything more then it means ""to joke"" in Italian. Yeah, thanks, very helpful) and continually using that word throughout the text. Horrible book, avoid at all costs, and if you have a class that uses it don't take it!"
1,NO CD I'm going to fail,I need the CD and they don't included or make it clear. Don't buy from them.
4,No regrets,"I read The King's Peace ages ago and was sorry to see the end of it. Silly me I never checked to see if there was more to follow. When I found this book I fairly LEAPT on it, and was grabbed, and dragged back into Sulien's world, by the eyeballs, from the opening paragraph. While it does get a bit verbose here and there, and kind of overly detailed now and again, it is still a MEAL for the mind. I thoroughly enjoyed how the two books began and how it ended and have NO regrets about setting aside a portion of my time, and brain, for the experience."
2,Difficult To Open.,"I was thrilled to have received these in the mail, I used to eat these on a regular basis when I lived in California. However, these are impossible to open, I mean, to have the candy come out. You have to press hard and use a lotta force to get the candy to push out, so I'd say maybe not as fresh as I'd like. After one I basically gave up. I didn't feel like a refund was necessary. I was just disappointed."
5,Better than the REST,Universal Fit. Better than the swing-arm senders. Highly recommended. Make sure you measure the depth on your tank and select the sender size appropriately.
5,This book rocks!,"Tyler Stricker is sexy, you should buy this book. Because I need money, I mean, that Tyler Stricker kid needs money...? Dammit."
3,Interesting read,"Essays by multiple authors against creation as a science. Whether it should be taught along with evolution. Many thought provoking ideas, but I think lacking in their own science.Not one of us can admit to knowing all there is to know, so that leaves us with agnostics and believers. I find the individual who mocks a creator, after observing the enormous complexities that make up life is a fool. Open your eyes and use your God given brain. Are you willing to take the risk? The only risk on earth will be believing there is something outside of the material world. It is really the only explanation. God created science didn't he? Do the evolutionists teach ""hard science"" or do they let there dogmas get in the way of the truth? Is not evolution a faith also? Let's stop teaching a theory in our schools as gospel. Evolution and Creationism are both faiths, only one makes sense."
3,An enjoyable read,"The book deals with a unique topic, from an unexpected point of view. I liked the authors word choices. She makes several interesting observations about life's choices."
5,A Trick of Light,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It shows how love is able to blind us to the possibilities of another life. How circumstances can change how we would normally react.I admired how Hattie handled herself and learned to understand why her husband was what he was.A very good read.
4,Definitely Will Divide Opinion,Another special for the book club environment with no doubt a lot of discussion on the action or lack of action by the principal character. I am sure opinion we will be divided on the decisions made as to whether it is right or wrong.
2,Disappointed,"While ""A Trick of Light"" held my attention, certain parts of the story did not meet my threshhold of believability. For example, I believed she would leave home looking for an answer to the missing links within her marriage, but I did not get it that she could ease herself into the other wife's life so easily--this part needed more substance for me. I hated the ending--she meets the brother and falls in love with him, then just says, ""Oops, goodbye, I have to go now since I can't tell you who I really am."" Not a good ending at all--why not find a way for her to come clean about who she was and start a more honest relationship with the brother of her husband's other wife? Overall, I thought it was a good story but not a fabulous read!"
3,"Great story, until the nd","I really enjoyed this book, until the ending. I was so captivated and could not stop reading. And then the book just ended. Nothing was wrapped up, the story had no sort of satisfactory conclusion. It was like the author needed to quickly end the story, but didn't know how. There was just no closure and so many unanswered questions. The story really needs a few more chapters to bring any sort of resolution to the plot line."
4,A Trick of Light-Pleasantly Entertaining,I really enjoyed this book. I liked the main character and the story line was pretty interesting. I would definitely recommend this book.
3,Good not great,"This is by no means a bad book. Though it gets off to a bit of a slow start, there's a decent and compelling story. It would make a great Lifetime movie. However, as other reviewers have noted, there were a lot of typographical errors--missing close quotes, weird paragraph breaks, etc. Those were distracting. More distracting, though, was the fact that the characters all sound like the author. When a Polish character speaks, he or she speaks in long narrative form so that it's hard as a reader to feel like you're listening to different characters. That said, though, I would watch the heck out of the Lifetime movie made out of this book. I would probably recommend, but only if you like melodrama and some goofiness."
3,A Trick of Light,I enjoyed this book mostly because of the unexpected twists and turns it took as the compassion was shown. It was an entertaining read and I would recommend it to my friends.
3,Trick of Light,"This story was filled with improbabilities, poor judgements and secrets in relationships with few real consequences. Of course thinking ""what an idiot!"" about a character made it no less readable. It flowed rapidly and kept me reading because I wanted to know what would happen. I call this a good airport read."
5,A Trick of Light,"Absolutely great book!This book was a great summer read, I have recommended it to all of my friends. I highly recommend this author."
4,Interesting read!,I enjoyed the story very much........it was a quick and pleasant read with many surprises.........and a most unusual ending that left you in deep thought.
5,fast read,Definately a book to get lost in. The story pulls you in right away and holds your attention to the end.
1,"Interesting story, poorly written","This book had an interesting premise, a woman finding out what secrets her husband had kept from her while he was alive. But I just found it so hard to read that I ended up basically just skimming the second half of the book to find out how it ended. The grammar was distracting. I also found the writing to be lacking in a certain maturity. Every time there was a new occurrence in the plot line, it was explained and stated several times, to the point of overkill. I agree with other reviewers that say the author should have made better use of an editor. Overall, I would NOT recommend this book."
1,A Trick of Light,I'm grateful that I was able to borrow this book-- I would have been disappointed if I had purchased it. It's an interesting if improbable story and Blomain's writing is workmanlike; but the book is in dire need of an editor. The characters lacked consistency and definition. I was troubled by an erratically shifting point of view. (Most of the time we were inside the protagonist's head; but occasionally we were treated to someone else's interior dialogue.) I got through it but didn't find it a particularly good use of my time.
1,Boring,This book was very wordy for such a simple and boring plot. I could not work up any interest in the characters nor in their interminable thoughts.
1,Terrible story,I thought this was a terrible plot and very frustrating to read. I couldn't even finish the book. The right choice was not made by the character and the story was unbelievable and somewhat boring as well.
5,Beautiful story of love and forgiveness,"Beautiful story of amazing strength & difficult choices. Exhibits an exceptional example of grace & acceptance. Highly recommend, couldn't put it down until I had finished!"
3,Just ok,"This book was ok, nothing to get excited about. The characters seemed to be moving in slow motion. Disappointing read."
3,More like 3.5 stars,"Easy read but a little bit slow at some points. I thought that some points were over explained. I also think that the main character is not the sharpest tool in the shed, but I didn't dislike her.Overall, it was ok. I dont feel like I wasted my time reading it."
3,A Tick of Light,"I enjoyed the book though it was a little slow in places. I had not read this author before so it might be me just getting used to her writing style, interesting subject matter."
5,Very watchable!,"I love the Decalogue, but I could never watch every film in a single sitting. With this, each story went by as quickly as I could put them into the player. This doesn't necessarily mean they were fluff, however, or that I felt the viewer was ""let off"" easily. The subtitles run a little on VHS and I wish I could have purchased it on DVD. The cinematography is breathtaking so maybe it's a good thing each is only 50 minutes long, all without a single car chase! Each story is also different from all the others so there's a sense of unpredictability. But what's important is that when it's all said and done, these are films that can be appreciated by most westerners and not just eastern cinema buffs. They can't watch and not love at least one of them!!!"
3,Okay After Reading Other Books,"This was pretty good, a bit repetetive from the author's perspective, but interesting if you are a die-hard Lucy fan."
4,exceptional read and a real inspirational book!!!!,Keith Thibodeaux effectively communicates the truth about the real meaning of life and the facades that the public believes about celebrities is brought to light. A must read that will guarantee you insight into the human experience.
3,An alternative dictionary and word history,"I seriously believe there's no such thing as an ""obscene"" word; it's usage that gives a word any perceived obscenity. That said, ""The F Word"" is an interesting little book that doesn't mince...um...words. The smart and irreverent introduction provides you with the etymology of the f word; Roy Blount's foreword is another nice touch.Then there's the body of the book. This is a dictionary, straight and simple. Like any other dictionary, it gets a little eye-numbing if you try to read it straight through. This is a volume to dip into in bits and pieces. The F Word is a definitive study of a the word that we're not supposed to say but all know so very well! Use it for humor, use it for reference, use it your own word education. Writers stuck for an insult within their prose will certainly find a plethora of potential in these pages."
3,Funny at first...,"The first few pages of this book is f'ing funny!! But after about 5 minutes, one gets pretty tired of it. I got this as a gift, but i don't think i would spend money on this book. In my opinion, this is not a really good read or a good buy, but rather a cool novelty gift, or an easy way to impress your friends, and laugh for a few minutes. Don't know if it's only me, but Bevis & Butthead come into mind when i think about someone reading this book."
3,It's OK But You Can Do Better!!,"Much Better!! We Bought this sometime back & for a Dr Hook Budget Release it's OK but you are missing some of their biggest Songs. These guys were hit makers & if you are familiar with them you won't be satisfied with this one either.....Darn!! It's been over Seventeen Months since I've done a Review with Amazon & only two Reviews in slightly less than Three Years!! In my previous Reviews I was mostly Bragging about the Item but I can't do that with this Item. It's just too Skimpy & that's exactly why I typed this Review. Get Capital's ""Greatest Hooks"". It's much better."
5,Super man has no power for the Yatzi express.,"Wonderful! Excellent. I say to you. This book combined the magicallneess and necessities of the world to bring back our founding fathers. To display my gratitude to Malcom C. Eighch (8-ch) I will sing a song to you! I see the movie, I read it in only thirteen months I am happy, because it is good for moths and me Please write more books today Because they are cool, I say! When I first read Mary Huchengeizer and the sorcerer of medicoon, I learned history has a story, and it's his! KAT, no TOOKE says nine."
4,A very readable history of the American Revolution,"This is a very good, readable history of the American Revolution. The book does a very good job of giving you the British side of the Revolution. I enjoyed the book, and so did my 13 year old son.The only thing the book doesn't have is much material about the war at sea, but this is a minor shortcoming."
5,Two great old movies,Haven't seen any Lana Turner movies in years..fun to watch 2 of her good ones.Nice that they packaged two in the same set.
5,A must see movie,Madamn X is probably one of the best movies ever made. Ranks up there in the top 20 of all time. An absolutely MUST BUY!!!!
2,Portrait In Black / Madame X,"Portrait In Black / Madame X (Double Feature)When I went to open the movie, I noticed a red stamp on the packaging stating the movie was made in Mexico. No big deal, right? Wrong! We proceeded to watch the 1st movie ""Portrait in Black"" and it kept switching from light to dark throughout the ENTIRE movie. It was very annoying and it was hard to concentrate on the movie and enjoy it. I know this happens when movies are recorded from VHS to DVD and have a copy guard on them to prevent from getting a good copy. I ordered 4 other movies and a couple of the others had the same red stamp on them. I haven't watched them yet but keeping my fingers crossed the same thing doesn't happen on the others. I wonder if anyone else has had this experience."
5,MadameX,"I bought this because I was looking for Madame X, but found I loved both movies. I would buy from this seller again"
5,Good entertainment,This movie has a good story and good acting as well.This possibly is because the actors themselves are among the best.
3,Not an accurate replica,"The price I paid for this doll was amazing, however, it in noway looks like Galleria (Raven). Cute doll though, my daughter has never taken it out of the package (been 8 months) so we are now going to save it in the package, who knows it may be collectable one day"
2,Poor quality books,"These comic books are great. My son will spend an hour at a time devouring them. He is only 5. The problem I have with them however, is that they are falling apart. At first I thought it was only the one book. We must have broken the spine or soemthing, but no. All of them are loosing their pages. Now I know my son is only five, but believe me when I say he is very careful with his books. He cherishes them. Theya re just made very poorly. We are so diappointed as we have to keep reorganizing the pages and figuring out hwere they belong. Expensive little books to have falling apart. Very disappointed."
5,"Look out, Skynard fans","If you like bluegrass but also old southern fried rock, this album is heaven for you. Incredible reproductions of LS songs i actually like better than the original (in most cases)."
5,Grabs you on the first listen!,"Feel's music is extremely well-produced hook-laden pop that might remind you of feel-good AM radio hits of the 70's, like ""Go Your Own Way"" by Fleetwood Mac, or ""The Things We Do For Love"" by 10CC.These guys have a big sound and mature lyrics. The first four songs have such catchy melodies and choruses that you'll almost immediately want to start singing along."
4,Great CD - Great Group of Guys,"I met ""Feel"" with my girlfriend on a plane to Hawaii. Scott was nice enough to give us a single of the song ""Got Your name on it"". After we grabbed our rental car we popped in the CD and were instantly hooked. Now we have the CD. Great music by a great group of guys. It was nice meeting you Scott - can't wait for the next CD."
2,Pop Pap,"I am very disappointed in this CD. Lyrics are sophomoric, music is bland and uninteresting. I appreciate Beatlesque music and am a big fan of Jason Falkner, Owsley et al. But this had no redeeming features for me."
4,Interesting and great!,"Excellent love story... great cast, great acting! You also have to take a look at the DVD extras. Would definitely recommend buying this one for your collection."
2,Proof that nudity can't prevent boredom,"I am uncertain why I kept watching this film to its conclusion. It's slow and fake artsy and fake intellectual and positively brimming with unlikeable and shallow (and occasionally naked) characters who all seem to have the hots for each other.The cover art for this film might be it's greatest strength. That and the generous nudity and lengthy group shower scenes. There is decent music and great scenery and sets, decent dialog and twists and turns, but unfortunately it all begins and ends in nothing. And that is what I felt at the end. Nothing.So, steer clear of this dud unless you have a thing for mindless but obviously well-financed messes which keep you speed reading the subtitles for basically no reason. (I don't think I would have missed much if I turned them off and just watched. It's not really that complicated.)"
3,Rather nice. Worth a viewing.,"This gets good reviews from my friends, though I lost interest mid-way through. A view of the upper-class French world, and the homosexual underworld where class differences don't matter so much as youth and muscles. A bit cliched here and there, but nothing too unpleasant. Plenty of nude shots to keep you interested. As much hetero as homo action from the glimpses I caught of the movie. But the hetero action is decidedly uninspired, as you might expect.The French are forever making films about love triangles."
1,Pretentious,"This movie is pretentious and totally false in the development of its characters. It seems to result from some sort of intellectual head trip somewhere (in France, of course). The nude scenes do not justify such a waste of time."
3,About the Grande Ecole,It Is a good movie but it would be better if it was in english. The reason is you can't really watch the movie while you are reading the subtitles.
5,DELICIOUS COMBO OF BLUES AND ROCK,"NEXT TO EXPERIENCING ERIC SARDINAS LIVE, THIS WILL HELP SATISFY YOU UNTIL YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE HIM LIVE AGAIN. WHAT A TRIP."
3,Solo para coleccionistas,"Fue el primer disco de la banda, es una excelente placa para tenerla como antologia, no obstante dice que esta remasterizada y sin embargo se escucha ruido de pua en el comienzo. Solo para coleccionistas"
3,it ALL depends...on what you like!,"Just grabbed this today for the fun of it, just to see what it was like, hand't ever heard of any of the tracks on it and being a jazz fan that i am, that surprised me so i had to have it. In my case, curiosity killed the cat...it's not what i thought it would be, not so smooth, but if you're into extremely ordinary, mainstream jazz, the kind of thing that you hear at the commercial break for the lakers game, then this album is most certainly for you. No disrespect, just not my cup o tea"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,I was driving in the California Mountains near Lake Tahoe and these pads literally started to smoke and my car would barely stop! This is the exact same route I have driven on several times with the OEM pads without ever having a problem. These pads had less than 500 miles.Don’t ever buy this product.
4,Sheep dairy,"The book is good with lots of information. It is an older book, but is still applicable. It has sections on care of sheep, types of sheep, how to build milk stands, problems you can encounter and other helpful information."
5,Excellent little device,"I love this paint mixer, it is perfect for mixing model paints. It is great for thinning paints for my airbrush and getting the pigmentation smooth. Will definitely buy another one if I ever wear this one out."
4,Great if you like to mix colors a lot,"I have only used this a dozen times or so. It's extremely easy to use, just be careful to start with it against the side of your mixing cup so it doesn't spray everywhere. It is pretty powerful so like I said be careful. It's a breeze to clean. I run it under water and turn it on...Walla! The plastic feels a little cheap so it lost about a half a star, but mine is still working even after I dropped it when cleaning it so I guess it's not too terrible. Hope this helps with your decision."
3,"Read before, leave at home","A very interesting guidebook to Bilbao and surrounding areas including the French Basque region. Great and lengthy historical and cultural introduction, many sidenotes that have been well-researched. Probably an excellent guide if you plan to drive the region with descriptions of several routes and geographical organization. (You would still want some excellent highway maps.) However, if you plan to use public transit, specific helpful data are lacking. Reviews of lodging, restaurants, attractions are out-of-date despite 2003 copywrite. Some attractions are closed and many prices are way off."
5,excellent CD,Mindi Abair is a multi-talented artist pop influenced vision ofjazz. A saxophonists/vocalists/percussionists and composer. Sheplays alto & soprano sax/ keyboards/vox and wind chimes. If you like Candy Dulfer you will love her songs. Mindi has much to offer than just a pretty face. THIS ALBUM IS A MUST TO ADD TO YOUR JAZZ COLLECTION
5,Sexy Sax,"An amazing new sound, with a refreashing, beautiful face to back it up. Her talent will hold you throughout the entire disc. This is what jazz music has been begging for...make way Dave Koz, you've got competition."
1,I Am Sorry...This CD Left Me Wanting,"I am truly sorry to say that upon opening and sliding the CD in to my car CD I was totally caught off guard since it has world class players backing Mindi up. I felt as if someone took some fairly talented sax player from a high school band and put a hot backup band behind them. If you like Spyro Gyra, Kenny G, Paul Desmond, Bill Evans or any of the world class saxophonists I would not recommend buying this album. Intonation among other problems makes it hard to listen to. If I could have repackaged and sent this back to Amazon I would have. My apologies to Mindi and any others that may be offended because I wanted to like this CD...it just did not do it for me."
1,Style over substance,I been awaiting this release with baited breathe but i was thoroughly dissapoointed. I don't see any new ground covered with her tracks. She must have read the script of all the other radio sax players and passed with flying colors. I hope that blonds can learn to be more innovative instead of following the same old radio recipe!!
1,Nothing New...,"Unfortunately, this is just another smooth jazz ""David Sanborn"" clone. White sax players have been stuck in Sanborn sound for over 10 years now, and still can't seem to break out of this rut.Save your money and buy the ""real deal"" (Coltrane, Grover, Redman, Rollins, etc)"
5,Mindi Abair's It Just Happens That Way,"Mindi Abair's ""It Just Happens That Way"" is a great collection of jazz songs. I've been working out this past year and listening to her play the sax really gets me into my workout routine. Plus, downloading music from Amazon is so easy and convenient."
5,protoplazmic !!,"Very seldom do you hear a CD where you just love every selection, but I just found one here. You cannot listen without wanting to get up and move it. I can't wait to receive it and begin sharing with my sweetie. This is one I will play over and over and it will easily slip into my pile of all time favorites."
5,Great new sound,Fantistic album each track is different and I like them all. Can't stop going to this album 1st. I agree with Allen's review
3,New Candy Dulfer?,"Like Candy Dulfer, Mindy Abair is a very pretty sax player. Because this is only ""smooth"" jazz, it's a little hard to tell how talented she really is, there are no impressive solos, and much of the CD is background music for a nice dinner. Still, she blows a nice sax sound, and her vocals are sexy. As you can see from the other reviews, the smooth jazz crowd loves this stuff, but if you're more into Coltrane, you're going to want to take a pass. Personally I really like the title cut, and ""flirt,"" but I think the CD would have been better if a standard or two could have been introduced to break up the smooth jazz monotony."
5,Mindi Abair: unique and up tempo!,"If you haven't heard of Mindi Abair by now, where have u been? Mindi is a young hip Jazz musician who recently launched her debut CD, which is slowly sneaking to the top of the charts. Whether or not you traditionally listen to Jazz or not you'll like this CD. She's got a very unique style that mixes classic jazz with contemporary pop and boy can she blow. Before I listened to her, I never believed I could fall in love with a Jazz CD, one listen to Mindi however and I've been hooked ever since. She's got up tempo stuff, moderate and easy listening. One of the tracks titled, Lucy's, would make a perfect wedding song -something to keep in mind-."
3,Safe.,"This girl defiantly has talent, no doubt, but this album felt as if she was playing it safe. Her tunes were easy, repetitive, her solos were soft...hardly any soul in here whatsoever. She tried to sing in one of the songs, which to me, sounded horrendous. I hope she doesn't attempt to sing in the future. Her saxophone skills are her strong point above all. Over all, it's a good cd in a jazz collection for easy listening."
3,It Just Happens That Way,"Although I liked the songs, they all sounded very similar and the sax was a little too subdued for me."
2,A Better Choice,"The music on this CD all sounds the same. I bought & really enjoy her other album ""come as you are"" & recommend it to everyone."
2,Stupid/gullible heroine; weak romance; unfullfilling conclusion,"The stuff about Max's diabetes was really interesting and educational, but the romance between Emma and Preston wasn't really deep and Emma just kind of seemed stupid at times when it came to Manuel. Also, there really wasn't much of a resolution to the Vince-Preston issue. Not one of Novak's best."
4,conversation piece with function,"It looks like an alien bot on one's kitchen counter! A well-functioning juicer with great design,hefty weight, and protective-gripping pads on the leg tips. Plenty of room for a collecting glass or measuring cup in the center."
4,Great design. Utility is OK,This is a great design for something as simple as a lemon squeezer. Looks like the Sputnik spacecraft :) It is good for squeezing lemon but nothing larger. It will help you drain every last drop of juice from the lemon. Build is good and solid. It is heavy so it does not wobble and is tall enough to squeeze juice into tall glasses.
5,Excellent - great information,"This is one of the best UFO video's I have seen! The US media rarely shows 1/100th of the video and information available. This is an opportunity to hear Bob Lazar's full interview and that of CIA pilot John Lear's story as well. There is a lot of interesting information on S-4 section of Area 51. I had not heard about EBE's and Zeta Reticuli until I saw this video.The really nice part of this video information is that viewers are not subjected to continuous insulting comments from Skeptic and other disinformation critics on the government's payroll... thankfully this video is excellent and uninhibited (unlike any anti-UFO, disinformational tripe presented by National Geographic and History channel).Any production which George Knapp is involved with has been excellent thus far. Now if someone would do a video on the Dulce, New Mexico underground facility, it might shed more light on another seldom covered UFO/Alien issue."
1,UFOs & Area 51: Secrets Of The Black World,"Save your money. While this production was better than Flying Saucers Area Real it still isn't worth the price. It is horribly done with lots of shakey video footage of blurred lights in the sky. That and ""he said she said"" type stories. Some of the interviews have distracting background noises in them like the tape recorder was squeaking as the spindles turned! I thought something was wrong with my DVD player at first! Bob Lazar's interview is the only interesting/redeeming portion of the set. This was very disappointing. Get the Unsolved Mysteries UFO DVD set, but leave this one alone. It is really amature."
4,First in a Series,"Steve Hounsome proposes the use of the Tarot as a therapy, along with other complementary and natural procedures; the only other person talking like this is Eileen Connolly.Basically the idea is working with and viewing the cards as a healing tool; the worst part of the book is where he tries to give historical validity for this theory, I guess he feels that he should have some justification for it, so he traces its origins origins.Better is the exercises and guidelines that he gives that enable you to go on your own `Seeker's Quest' with the aid of the Tarot, and also outlines methods of working with the Tarot as a therapy in consultations.This book is the first volume in a proposed three volume set, intended to give a full course in the use of Tarot as a therapy. Volumes two and three are still in preparation. With all that said, look at Connolly's books if you can get them, some are here on Amazon, either as your basis your supplement to this pivotal idea."
5,Hysterically Funny Reflections on Parenting Hits Home!,"I read this book years ago and find myself chuckling even now when I recall some of the stories. I am a professional speaker, whenever I need true-to-life humor on parenting I gravitate back to this little book. It's guaranteed to make any parent laugh out loud, while also lifting the burden of guilt so many busy parents feel today. Too bad it's out of print!Connie Neal, author of many books found at www.amazon.com/author/connieneal"
4,"Bobby great, orchestra a bit flat.","This is mostly for the fans (me) i guess. I miss Bobby's soul influences on the records after he left Toto. A little sad that he records Toto-songs with a generic band like this, but his voice is still great. Check out his two solo albums as well. There is also a rare soul record from the 70's called S.S. Fools, with great vocals by Bobby.All in all, the record's beautiful and a bit sad but hey, that's rock and roll. Just don't expect a Toto-record."
4,Bobby Kimball Rocks!!,"If you like Bobby Kimball, this is for you. It is not TOTO, but TOTO songs with a pretty good sounding Orchestra. Excellent quality. Worth the money. Enjoy."
4,Excelente por ser de los Simpsons..pero..,"El estampado es genial y muy bueno. La tela no es 100% cómoda, pica un poco y la talla es una L pequeña."
4,Great Add on!,I purchased the SG90 griddle to use on my Camp Chef weekender stove. This griddle allows the stove to be used for much; much more than it was before without haveing to use several different frying pans to get your food done. Definitely would re-commend the purchase of the SGLG carry bag to keep the griddle in. Why not combine them and a person would get both when the griddle is purchased.
5,Would definitely recommend,"Purchased as a gift for my dad, and he LOVES it. Makes burgers taste so much juicier and flavorful than just cooking on a grill."
2,Griddle won't fit,"I have the camp chef explorer(2 burner) stove and this griddle will not fit with the deluxe single burner grill box(the one withthe hinged top--the standard lift off grill box probzably fits fine) . Not sure why they did this, as they are both single burner items. You would think that 2 single burner items would fit together on a double burner stove. I was able to fix the problem by cutting a notch in the bottom of the griddle. and now my griddle overhangs my stove by about 2"" while the grill box is also on stove. They should do a better job with this so called modular system."
5,Great with camp stove,"Great product. Purchased this along with three burner campchef stove for cubscout pack. Just got back from our first campout where we cooked for about 70 people. Speghetti/meatballs for dinner, Pancakes, bacon, and sausage for breakfast. Item worked great and all the cooks said it was the best money we've ever spent on our Pack. Griddle is very heavy duty with built in heat diffusers. Very front doesn't get as hot as rest of the grill but it still has a lot of usual surface."
5,Camp Chef's SG90 Deluxe Griddles,"I recently purchase Camp Chef's new patio stove Somerset IV to replace my older traditional grill. I wanted a flat top type cooking surface so I bought two of Camp Chef's SG90 Deluxe Griddles an I also purchased a Camp Chef BB-90L grill box.This combination of cooking a grill box and griddles lets us cook a larger variety of foods and different methods of cooking. I love it and because everything is Camp Chef, I expect it to last for many years."
3,Constant Heat is not it's friend !,In my profesional opinion as a chef when using this griddle for 8 hours straight even at a medium temp. there was quite a bit of heat distortion .Possibly if you using it for a couple hours it might be ok .I was suprised because the griddle is very sturdy & heavy.
2,Appalling translation of the otherwise good book,"Appalling translation of the otherwise good book. The translation is so awful that the book is nearly unreadable. I don't know why Schiffer employs translators who can barely write in proper English, let alone translate from the German. Don't waste your money."
3,A HISTORY OF ARMY GROUP SOUTH,"TRANSLATED FROM GERMAN, THIS IS ONE OF A SERIES OF STUDIES ABOUT THE VARIOUS ARMY GROUPS FIGHTING IN RUSSIA DURING WORLD WAR 2; IN THIS CASE ARMY GROUP SOUTH. IT IS A GOOD SOLID HISTORY. IT IS WELL WRITTEN, BUT SOMEHOW I EXPECTED MORE! MORE INSIGHT IN TO THE MILITARY DISASTERS PUSHING THE NAZIS BACK, MORE ABOUT THE COMMAND CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE MEN ON THE GROUND AND THE HIGHER POWERS IN BERLIN. IT WASN'T THERE. IF YOU WANT A BASIC NARRATIVE FOR THE BEGINNING STUDENT THIS BOOK WLL DO THE JOB."
1,"Horrible translation, almost unreadable.",I agree with other reviewers. This book had great potential but is marred by absolutely incompetent translation of German military terms. What a disservice to a good author.
5,Awesome fun that's well worth the price,"I picked up Stephen Romano's book Shock Festival when it came out at my local comic book shop and enjoyed it immensely, so when I found out a DVD version was coming out I was anxious to pick it up. I have to say this DVD companion did not disappoint.The 3 discs (two DVDs and a CD full of mp3s of radio spots and music) are a lot of fun and provide quite a bit of entertainment. Much like the 42nd Street Forever series of trailer compilations this set is an excellent sampler of exploitation films that have led to me finding a lot of hidden gems for my Netflix queue. Like the 42nd street volumes, the trailers on Shock Festival are a mixed bag of different exploitation fare; action, horror, martial arts, and some stuff that simply indescribable. Shock Festival is a must-have for fans of exploitation movies and its the perfect sort of DVD to have playing at a Halloween Party ot watch with a group of pals to goof on."
4,"For What's On Offer Here, It's A Must Have","This trailer set gives you real bang for your buck, it's camp, trashy and gross, everything you'd want in a trailer compilation and the MP3 disc is a total knockout.My only complaint was that the DVD discs had scratches on them but both played fine (I must have a good player) hence the four stars instead of five..So don't sit there thinking is it worth it, get this in your collection before it's deleted, boy am I glad I purchased this gem, it fits perfectly along side the 42nd Street Forever collection.Don't dream it, buy it, Now."
4,One thing keeps this collection from 5 stars ...,"... and that's the secondary audio commentary by ""Uncle Creepy"". Who is this guy and how does he rate the opportunity to participate in this otherwise excellent collection ? Maybe he suffers in comparison to Stephen Romano's entertaining, enthusiastic and educated commentary, but his rambling, mush-mouthed, near-incoherent commentary detracts from an otherwise excellent collection. I could only handle about 15 minutes worth, but I honestly believe I could do a better job providing commentary, and my experience is limited to genre film fandom and several years managing a video rental store.Otherwise, a great collection. Good picture quality, great variety of trailers and excellent commentary provided by Romano. The ""fake"" trailers are kind of hit-or-miss, the hits being entertaining and impressive, the misses just make you appreciate the hits ( and the genuine article trailers ) that much more. ""Uncle Creepy"" on the other hand ... one star."
4,What can I say.,"It is a multiple spice shaker. I would not buy it again just becuase when you are shaking one spice you end up with a mess as the other spices leak out. Great idea, less than ideal execution."
2,"Great assortment, good idea for container, terrible implementation","I really wanted to like this product. Super compact and easy assortment of spice for car camping. I really liked how compact the container appeared. But as soon as I received it I knew it was a failure. The plastic lids on each spice do not seal well at all. After just 1 use, I had to keep the whole thing in a doubled ziplock back to keep from getting spice dust in my chuck box. Also because some of the included spices are very strong smelling, as soon as it leaks, your gear will start to smell.Pass on this product and get yourself some small containers with threaded lids. It will take up a little more space, but it won't come with the frustration."
5,Great,All three of these movies are favorites for me so I love that I could find them in a triple feature! And the speedy shipping through amazon wasn't bad either!
1,Hayne's Automotive Repair Manual,"The main reason I purchased the manual was to find out how to replace the 3 sparkplugs at the rear of the 24 valve 3.0 liter engine. You cannot even get a hand on them because the intake manifold is right above them. The instructions in the manual said only - 'the sparkplugs are accessible thru the valve covers'. This was no help at all. I think you either need to remove the intake, or have special tools. I would like my money back."
5,Very good instruction of where and how to check,"I have read Clinton's book before that shows only pix and how to disassemble. So I haven't exepect much. ( You may read some review on that book. ) However this book explains which part and how to check it. For instancem using multimeter( voltage ). So the reader may find where is the problem by himself. I have read only part of this book ( where my car has problem ) , I am sure this will help a lot. I strongly recommend to the person who want to find the problem and repair it by himself."
3,Good book,I bought an old edition. Pictures are rather dark. And it says nothing about how to make speedometr to function. In general it's a good book. I would rather recommend.
1,complete garbage,i had a 1996 ford mercury sable and all i had was parts breaking down.this car is junk junk junk. its a shame i had to give it one star. i would like to give it no stars but to write a review you have to give it a star. and now to top it all the transmission just went. i will never never buy a american car again. i bought this car new.
2,BEWARE: DVD-R Product...,"Just as with Fantasy Factory's Season 2 DVD, this is a ""burned when you order it"" release direct from Amazon.com, undoubtedly slim on any extras or universal playability (unless your player supports DVD-R playback, it won't work), again, just as with Season 2.Once again, it's sad that I have to say how much more this great show and its fans deserve.PLEASE MTV, give us REAL releases of these seasons, commercial grade, with organized extras, etc. You did it for Rob & Big, you did it for FF Season 1. So how 'bout it??Ppl, the only way to get real, top-notch releases from MTV is to NOT buy into this DVD-R ""burn as you order"" shortchange.Awesome show, awful DVD sham."
3,Show is AMAZING DVD quality bites.,"Don't get me wrong, I am a HUGE fan of Rob's and all his shows. With that being said, this DVD set does NOT do him justice. It feels slapped together in a matter of seconds. The quality is terrible, like watching a poor quality Youtube video. This is really disappointing. I regret buying this now."
4,How can you not like this!?,"I have all the seasons of Rob and Big as well as Fantasy Factory. Very funny show, if you're a fan it won't dissapoint. I was nervous about it but the DVD-R format looked just fine. There aren't any special features either but I really don't care about those much anymore. Particularily since this season has a couple behind the scenes episodes already."
3,UN LIBRO PROMEDIO,"A pesar de las críticas realizadas hacia este libro, no encuentro razón para dar una reseña en la cual mate por completo el interés del lector hacia este, ya que es un libro que cumple lo que se necesita en un escrito de aventuras, osea que, este libro posee una historia entretenida, audaz y con muchos acertijos que hacen que en ocaciones el lector pueda predecir el desenlace, tal es el caso con lo de la Especialista que para los que ya la leyeron, me imagino que supusieron quién era, pero al final el libro si se parece mucho a una película de suspenso tipo Hollywood y deja enseñanzas lejanas a un libro de pensamientos profundos, pero vuelvo a repetir, este libro no es aburrido solo predecible y vale la pena darle una leída, al final siempre es bueno leer, y este libro es sencillo y rápido de digerir y terminar, es un libro de atención promedio."
2,LENTO Y SIMPLE,"La segunda parte de la Leyenda del Águila y el Jaguar esta aburrida, demasiado simple, los hechos pasan uno tras otro sin un peso especifico hasta llegar a un final precipitado que no termina de cuajar. En este libro los personajes Alex y Nadia están escritos como adultos tontos en lugar de adolescentes inteligentes como se supone que deberían ser. No me atrapo como La ciudad de las bestias, esto solo parece el primer borrador de la novela."
5,You can't touch the glass at the museum either.,"This book is amazing. Almost a good as a walk through an installation. Beautiful pics, excellent paper/color quality. Excellent narrative. Highly recommend. As always, the work is breathtaking. How nice to see it so ""up close."""

4,Definite Shades of Ngaio Marsh,"It's beem awhile since I read the first book in this series. It was enjoyable because I love ""cozies"". This one is quite different than the typical English village where death upsets the daily lives of the villagers, but it sure reminded me of Ngaio Marsh. For those of you who have read Ms. Marsh, you know that she sets her mysteries around English theatre. This book by Ms. Graham is set around an English theatre company, and all of the innuendos and undercurrants that surround a small country company. It's a good story, and I found that I still really like Barnaby and Troy. Ms. Graham is the first modern author that I have found that can write mysteries like the old English masters- Marsh, Dorothy Sayers, Agatha Christie and Margery Allingham. Nice subplots, humour, characterization, ambience and setting."
5,Pimsleur's German I,"wow, this is a lot easier than I thought it would be. I like that they keep reinforcing what was learned earlier. This is also making conversation easier. I can already read German, but have not been able to converse."
3,220:32=35:16,"I bought German I (approx 220$) after having purchasedInstant Conversation (approx 35$).To my surprise, the first 16 of the 32 lessons of German I are identical to the 16 lessons of Instant Conversation.Not only I got the same material twice, but I overpaid it!"
4,Great if you have previously studied the language,"I have now finished Pimsleur's German I & II and am starting III. This is excellent if you already know the sentence structure of German and the endings of words based on their gender and case. If you know these things you will not have your time wasted being told them again, if you do not know them you might be wondering why the words keep changing.I can now carry on a conversation in German better than I could after two semesters of college German. The problem is my conversation would be limited to asking and giving directions. (A little broader vocabulary in college.)If I were traveling to Germany this would be excellent. For me it is just a good starting point and I need to find other sources to broaden my knowedge.It would help if there were a written list of vocabulary words taught in each session. I find myself mispronouncing words since I do not hear everything exactly right. (I pronounced biegen, meaning turn, as viegen for a while.)"
4,Good for practicing,"This course will only teach you to speak German, NOT to write or read. It contains only CDs to hear german, you will repeat when instructed to. That is it."
5,Pimsleur German I,Wonderful program for us for learning German. Received promtly. Product was new and in great shape. The program is easy to use and follow. Makes learnng easy and enjoyable.
4,Excellent for the true beginner,"Admittedly, I'm not a true beginner in the sense that I have family that occasionally speaks German around me (although not too me). Plus, I've spent some months in Germany.But while I did know most of the stuff from the early lessons, it quickly took me to unfamiliar territory. And while some lessons were too much for a single sitting, most were quite excellent. Although, like most reviewers, I would argue that one listen to each track is never enough. I would listen twice to a typical track, and three times if it proved difficult.Regardless, I now have the 2nd, and 3rd lessons due to the success of the 1st. Which is to say that I now have a friend who I can practice my newfound German with, and they are consistently impressed by how much I know, and how quickly I came to know it.Also to note, this is only for spoken German. Don't expect much to anything in the way of becoming a master of German grammar!"
1,A HUGE SCAM,"This is a scam, no question about it. If you decide to buy this, you will be paying hundreds of dollars to learn a tiny vocabulary and virtually no grammar. And you will be an idiot."
5,easy way to learn,I've been really enjoying working my way through the series. The frequent reviews of previously covered material really do help keep it all in mind.
3,Philmont revisited,"I enjoyed reaquainting myself with places and adventures I had experienced when I was much younger. The unique camps that were described came flooding back into my memory like I had just been there! I recommend this book to anyone who has been to Philmont, on any level. I just wish there had been a nice map attached. Azure skies forever!"
3,Book: good Pictures: So-so,"I'm glad I bought this book because it gives me an Idea of the kind of person Skoglund is, and interesting information on her work as well as many works I have never seen before. However, I was dissapointed by the image quality in that the pictures were very dark and the color-depth was off. I have several postcards with Skoglund's photography on them, and they knock the socks off the picture quality in the book. Maybe in a few years another book will be made."
1,Don't do it!,"Neat idea. Unfortunately the software is unusable after installation. It does not recognize the ""PhotoEgg150"" even when you follow the directions. There is no web site, and the manual (surprise!) is useless.Great idea but I wouldn't buy one. We got it as a gift and will be returning it."
3,"Strong start, slow finish.","The book was a fast reader in the beginning chapters and the stories of the infant tugboat industry were informative even to folks who work the Northeast. But then the pace got bogged down in just that- Northeast. The title indicates that we might be reading about the day to day live of the boatmen. Soon it became obvioius that we were to see the industry through the eyes of one, now defunct, company and a few ""two on-two off"" employees. There was much more to be discussed, and many more companies to visit before readers get the true sense of life in a tug. Not to mentioin that the most interesting lives and the most determined employees are in the low paying creek outfits. Once we get to the high paying jobs up north, life gets pretty dull. Still, this book should be in a collection for those who enjoy maritime history and sea stories. All in all, not a bad read."
1,Van Helpless,"Reads like it was written by a high school kid -- who didn't do his home work.Lots of ""I believe this"" and ""I believe that"" from the author -- but no new facts or sourced info revealed. I think he did his research on Wikipedia."
4,Enjoyable,"I'm over halfway through this book and I'm really enjoying it. You are not going to need a dictionary while reading this tribute and history of Van Halen. Mr. Sanchez literary style is, how shall we say, California Hip. Lots of ""dude"", ""killer"" and other such intensive descriptives.Nonetheless, he does a really great job in describing the impact that Van Halen had and still has on rock music. The cool part of that is that they are an American band who had just as much impact as the British guys did. Twelve double platinum albums in row is a feat even Aerosmith has not even come close to touching. In fact, Led Zepplin only had ten studio albums.So thank you Abel. I'm listening to the mighty VH once again and enjoying them even more thanks to your book.tommyh"
1,Reads like it was written by Jeff Spicoli (Fast Times Ridgemont High),"I'm not going to waste a lot of space reiterating what other reviewers who gave this a '1' stated. What a disappointment! The only interesting content is some of the in-depth opinions from other musicians and people in the music industry. But even that gets old as you realize anything they might have said that could be construed as detrimental towards Ed was probably left out by the fanboy author. I myself have always been a big fan of the original band (DLR albums), but only the music and Eddie's playing style, not their personal lives and conflicts, so I wasn't looking for a soap opera(which it isn't). Unfortunately, this book is pretty nauseating in its constant praise and fan worship and I wouldn't recommend it unless you are a big Van Halen fan with a huge inferiority complex. Reading it is like listening to Jeff Spicoli talk about surfing in Fast Times at Ridgemont High...at least that was meant to be funny."
1,Unbelievably bad,This is one of the worst written books I have ever read. It reads like it was written by a semi-literate idiot who didn't mind repeating himself over and over (and over). Sometimes within two sentences. And the content is completely useless.The fact that anyone could rate this more than two stars is shocking.
1,Fair warning,"David Lee Roth made Van Halen. ""Van Hagar"" was a pale immitation and I'll be polite and not mention ""Van Halen III"" more than I have to. This book - despite being a bad collection of cliche, shallow worship of the Van Halen brothers, etc - doesn't cut it. Only for Eddie fans. Look at the cover for crying out loud... that's the whole book is an instant!"
4,Good job,"Received a copy for Christmas. Five days later I'm done. Rapidly digested it and plan on having another go 'round after new year's. Loved it. This thing is jam-packed with everything a fan could ever want to know about the band and so much more. Its no surprise Guitar Player, long considered by many to be the bible for all guitarists, likes and recommends the book."
5,SOON-TO-BE BESTSELLER,"This is one of the most professional and complete books I have ever read on any musical group. As a professional musician myself, I am thrilled that the author captured the history of this group with a profound depth that excels above the norm. It is a MUST READ for any rock music fan; guitar fan; musician; and even the history buff. Bestseller potential? You bet!!"
1,A Complete Waste of Time (AND MONEY)!!!!,"Do not buy this book, unless you don't know how do a Google search. In that case, buy it and you'll be blown away by how well researched it is. If you CAN find your way to a search engine, type in Van Halen and learn a whole lot more about a once great band. Crappy books like this are just another example of the crap EVH and company have been giving their fans since Van Halen III."
1,Don't waste your money,"I am about halfway through this book and have serious doubts about being able to finish it.The writing style is juvenile and irritating. The constant references to people as 'cats' and the reader as 'baby' is beyond annoying.In a rambling dissertation about Eddie Van Halen's guitar solo during the 2004 tour the author didn't even mention that Eddie's son Wolfgang joined him onstage at many venues. That, to many, was one of the tours' most memorable moments. In the discography section he does not mention that on the Van Halen 'Greatest Hits Vol. 1' CD that in the original pressing ""Running With the Devil"" had verses two and three reversed. Facts like these would have been much more interesting to both the casual and hardcore fans than much of the ramblings presented. I keep hoping for something more insightful in this book but it obviously will not be forthcoming.The tribute section seems to be the only section worth anyones' time."
2,Very poorly written,"The good thing about this book is that the author got about 100 famous guitarists to comment about how influencial Eddie Van Halen is. That section of the book is a very cool tribute to Eddie.However, the writing style is extraordinarily bad. It's so unprofessionaly written that is very hard to read. (I passed my girlfriend the book to see what she thought of the strange writing style, and she couldn't even get through the first page)! Also, the author is just a fan, with no real inside connection or inside scoop on the band. So, basically, any VH fan with a lot of time on their hands could have written this. And, chances are, if almost any other VH fan would have written it, it would have been written better.Hopefully some day there will be a VH book written by a band member, roadie, or manager."
3,reasonable but could have been better,"I thought Id write a quick review of this book because Im a huge VH fan and have also just finished the Van Halen guitar player interviews book.If you have purchased or read many of Van Halens interviews, especially Eddie's, you'll know most of the stories in this book, and for most other early stuff just download VH the early years for free off the internet.I guess its the authors style that got to me the most. Baby, man, period are words to use occasionally in a book. Seeing baby or dude at the bottom of every paragraph gets annoying after a while - as does his relentless praise of eddie re-inventing the guitar. After a while it almost taints eddie like a cling on fan.Would have liked to see more coverage on the other members of the band and more interesting stories that aren't covered in other books or common knowledge for VH fans.The best part of the book its its cover."
2,Misses the Mark,"A collection of three novellas by three different authors - perhaps to be enjoyed by those who most like their Christianity in a nice neat little box? Somewhat silly and unrealistic but with some interesting details, all with strong evangelical fundamentalist undertones and characters who are mighty quick to don their cloak of righteousness. Misunderstandings and bickering abound, and the ""feminine love interest"" in two of the stories actually strikes out physically. I struggled with the rigidity and hostility. There is little gentleness or grace - but rather there IS a high level of spoon-fed ""belief.""So, perhaps I should just avoid ""Christian Romance"" entirely? Well, if there had been any hint on the cover of this collection, I might have done exactly that. But I did bother to read these (bother being the key word?) and would instead refer the gentle reader to the fiction of Frederick Buechner, Jan Karon and Philip Gulley. For me this collection missed the mark.Mamalinda"
2,Hit and Miss Collection,"I have never read any of Ursula Le Guin's other writing; I understand she is a gifted fantasy writer. Her short stories, however, were hit and miss. My favorite was ""Standing Ground"" about a teenage daughter and her pregnant, retarded mother. Reading this collection of stories was not enough to drive me to look for more from her, gifted or not."
4,Well drawn images,"I am a mixed media artist and did not use this book a coloring book as it is sold but to obtain images to build on. Not living near the ocean I was unfamiliar with many of the sea shells and find this book a valuable resource for me to refer to for my art. I have several of her other ""coloring"" books and they are very well drawn as well. I recommend them for both adult relaxation in coloring the images as well as reference books for images."
3,Does not fit MSG20 griddle,"Well made bag, as are the other Camp Chef bags and products I have bought. I was disappointed that it would not fit my griddle even though it is clearly listed on the package (and the site) that it will. The MSG20 griddle would fit if not for the handles, which are nearly 2 inches wider than the opening.It might fit had they designed the zipper to continue around the corner to allow inserting the griddle. If you have one of the other griddle models that fit, this could easily rate a 5!"
2,SG30 carry bag,The griddle fits in the bag so tight that it very hard to zip shut. It needs to be cut taller
4,Griddle bag,"Fits cast iron single burner griddle, good quality, nice logo, strong zipper, strong carry handle, good protection for your griddle."
4,Provocative exploration,"This book raises questions and invites me to redefine what power means to me as a woman. Women leaders spend way too much time asking themselves - When is power appropriate to use? When is it not? What are the costs and benefits to me and to those around me when I am fully in my power? To often, this ambivalence and confusion prevents women from stepping into leadership. Read this book to learn more about your own stumbling blocks and to be inspired by many women who moved beyond theirs."
1,Don't buy from Tarps Direct! These tarps are intentionally too small,"Don't buy tarp from Tarps Direct!! I bought two of these 10x7 white tarps for a canopy frame. After I get the tarp and put it up, it's too small! Then I see in fine print on the packaging, ""Finished size is approximately 6"" smaller or up to 2% smaller"". Really? If I wanted a smaller tarp, wouldn't I have bought a smaller tarp? What a Forest Gump experience. Buying from Tarps Direct is like a box of chocolates, you never know what your going to get."
2,A Mediocre Read,"There is nothing exceptional about this book. It is a decently written, somewhat entertaining novel. Most of the time, it was fairly boring. Other times, it was excruciatingly boring. Sometimes, I faintly smiled. Not much of anything to be had here."
4,A very funny book.,"This novel will not move you to new philosophical ground, however there is something very compelling about the physical and spiritual squalor that the main character lives in. Farelly's prose is witty and the voice is unique. I hope despite his film success that he keeps writing novels."
3,"The copywriter life in LA on a fridge, a bed and a prayer.","Between trying to get The Girl, masturbating, scrounging for food at the local convenience store, Whats-his-face manages to write acceptable copy for his attempt to enter Hollywood. Even with the latter being Totally Unbelievable, I had enough patience to deal with the wacked out, troublemaking woman he houses out of ill-advised concern. Barely. We've heard this all before: ""I coulda been a contender but for my tender, bleeding, woman-loving heart."" But again, his bleating is acceptable because he fleshes out the the details of his sordid life in trashy, dog-kicking technicolor and throws in more than your average amounts of masturbation. Bleh (that translates into 3 stars) on the sub-plot, but thumbs up for flashy tv-like ""prose."" Entertaining if you've had one too many burrito mojados, and need some time for the tums to kick in before bedtime."
2,cotton candy of comedy,"Light on anything that grabs one as clever wit or even hardy humor, The Comedy Writer even lacks a story. An inside look at Hollywood? The two-part episode of Seinfeld offered a better glimpse and more laughs. A book to skip given its price. Wait for the movie -- that might be funny!"
2,Don't waste your time on this,"I'll admit it. I like Farrelly's movies. As a novelist, however, his style is barely adequate, and at times so incredibly slow moving that I had the urge to skip to the ""good stuff,"" although unfortunately, the good stuff never really came. There were a few good lines, yes, but the story never panned out. ..."
2,the protangonist is a jerk.,"I stopped after about 50 pages because the protagonist is so unlikeable. And not charmingly unlikeable as the tv show Seinfeld, but unlikeable as you want him to get run over. It's too bad, because the novel had an amusing premise."
5,The funniest book I ever read,"This is a look into Hollywood like never before. Farrelly's obvious autobiographical tale of the underside of Hollywood life is hilarious. From the insane roomate that refused to leave, to Herb Silverman, i.e. Tommy Sullivan. A quick funny read."
5,One of the best books I have read,"I read this book about two months ago and I loved it. I saw it in my local bookstore and decided to buy it. It is humorous, and is overall, just good. I highly recommend buying it because it is great fun to read and you won't put it down."
4,"NOT HILARIOUS, BUT REALLY ENTERTAINING...","Heck, no matter what the cappuccino crowd say, I thoroughly enjoyed Farrelly's flicks. Yeah, they're crass, stupid (but not mindless) slapstick. So what? They make you laugh, period. I got a kick out of THE COMEDY WRITER, too: a no-nonsense novel about Hollywood. Sure, nothing new under the sun, but a solid piece of escapist fiction, certainly better than the usual reheated pap by overhyped ""hip, young, literate"" auteurs."
4,Storyteller,"Okay I may be completely out on a limb here,but I have for a LONG time been waiting to see a Farrelly Brothers movie that isn't a comedy. Sound crazy? Well maybe it is, and I agree that if you reduce a Farrelly movie down to it's memorable moments (bodily fluids as hair gel, anyone?) you can point a finger and say that these two brothers are leading the charge into oblivion.But another reviewer here said it and I'll echo that as well - every single Farrelly story has at it's heart exactly that: namely a story and a heart. And this novel is a hint at the possibility that one day Peter Farrelly will forsake the ""brand"" and get serious with the story-craft. It's evidenced here that he can, that he has and that in the future he might on the silver screen.There's more than enough specific reviewing here about the novel, but I just wanted to say that I think this is well worth a read and you may actually walk away with a renewed appreciation of all things Farrelly."
3,Go Ahead And Read It,"I finally found this book at a Borders store, after looking in places like Waldenbooks. Anyway, I started it yesterday and finished it today, so already that must say SOMETHING good. It kept me involved because the characters and situations kept me interested. The plot didn't. It's really just a human story about a man's insecurities about a different place, and a deep guilt about losing someone. It's different from Peter Farrelly's movies, because it's darker, and at times, a downer. But it's not always like that, the characters are many and diverse. I especially liked Henry's agent. A big part of the book is Colleen, the psycho staying at Henry's house. She is written very well, and makes you wonder if even someone like HER would be on Howard Stern. So, all in all, you'll be happy with some of it, kind of down after the ending (it's realistic, hence not entirely happy), but overall you'll enjoy it."
3,Funny and witty but not a complete work.,"Very readable and funny, and relative to anybody who is struggling to find themselves in this world. He touches on the vulnurability of finally chasing his dreams and on the insecurities of being alone in a strange place with little money. I can relate to it in many ways and because of that I enjoyed reading the book. The ending soured my opinion because there barely is an ending and Farrelly never ties up loose ends. We become sympathetic to Doheny but we never find out if she deserves any sympathy and Herb Silverman is a rather funny character, but he has no signifigance or relationship with anyone else in the novel. I needed Farrelly to link the characters togeher and form some kind of conflict between them and he never did. I needed a better ending and never got it. I liked the individual stories though. I wish Farrelly could have summed them up better."
4,"Funny, smart, but a little too graphic","This novel was an excellant piece of work. I am only fifteen years old and someday I want to write screenplays. This book gave me a glimpse of what Hollywood is really like. Although graphic at times, the story is very intriguing."
4,Reads like a movie,"Ok, i like peter farrelly a lot, and this wasnt a dissapointing piece of fiction, although i would have probably felt differently if i didnt read it free because i work in a bookstore...my main gripe with the book is that it is exactly like a movie, and though it is hilarious, there should have been much more detail and elaboratiuon then he provided, simply becuase that is what makes books better than a movie, and that is what this book is missing."
5,Excellent Reproduction,Its just great that someone is finally reproducing the old LP and Cassette recordings of years ago so we can still enjoy them.
4,hook's will never lie to you...,"As a black woman poet/writer, I was able to connect with hook's experiences and frustrations. There were deeply moving passages that explored the pain in loving and the satisfaction of pain articulated. ""Language is a body of suffering and when you take up language you take up suffering too."" At times, though, I felt that hooks could have been more succinct; the book could have been half its size. All in all, it is an interesting exploration into the heart of a writer and is an honest read."
4,Insightful and revealing,"This insight to a black woman's life learning her craft of writing is insightful and very revealing. Those who have read Ms. hooks knows she leaves no leave unturned and has a no-holds approach to telling it like it is. The abuse, both physical and mental she witnessed in her childhood home must have been painful to relive. In expressing how it was to both want to follow her love of writing and loving a black man with the same ambition is a testament to her perserverance. When she found that she was being stifled she knew she had to choose for her own well-being. Loving and writing. Can the two be done? I recommend this book as a part of black women writers."
2,often interesting,"I first became interested in bell hooks, with her impressive way of outing hypocrisy among her contemporaries of academia. Then I realized she is much like them, but much louder. Of all the sanctimonious darlings of academic priviledge who are publishing books like this nowadays, hooks is perhaps the least talented author. As a feminist I am pleased to note that she really has had a beneficial influence upon contemporary feminism on campuses, pointing to the mixed blessings of white feminists from priviledged backgrounds who must also combat patriarchy. However, hooks is so full of herself that I don't think she realizes what a sloppy and predictable writer she is, echoing other people's opinions without noticing that she can do nothing except assume or reject their opinions of her. None too talented, but a live wire, at least within academic communities."
2,Airways or Airlines? This is strange!,"I'm not sure why the photo of the cover says ""Northwest Airways"" when in fact, it should say Northwest Airlines. When I see a mistake like this, it's disconcerting. Kind of makes me think there will be more mistakes inside. And there are plenty more. This is only the most obvious one..."
1,Tiny and innacurate,"Much too small to be a pictorial, and what's with ""Northwest Airways""? If the author can't get the company name right, what other facts are incorrect?"
2,Not a great book,"This book was really disappointing. It is about the size of a paperback novel, so the pictures in the book are really, really small. Only 18 pages focus on the history of Northwest and each of those pages has a black and white photo on it as well, not very in-depth.This is just a facts and figures book, if you want to know the wing span of a 747 this book will tell you. If you want to know what the fleet number of N301US is, this book will tell you. I can't recommend this book, though."
4,Plane Spotter,"Overall, I liked this book. It's small size makes it easy to carry in the camera bag. The indexes listing the planes/N-number/serial # are excellent. It could have included more photos on the historical type aircraft. But for an airline with the history of Northwest, the size of the book be much bigger as well as the price."
5,Love the product but the delivery....,"The product itself is wonderful. I loved reading it so much that I decided to purchase it. The product came in just like new, however, the delivery of the book came several days (about a month) after it's last date of delivery. Other than that, I'm happy it came just in time for Christmas."
5,Very Beautiful!!!!!!,"Excellant quality stools! Very sturdy and comfortable. Arrived on time, had no problem with shipping."
4,COMFORTABLE,iT IS NOT LEATHER BUT VERY HIGH QUALITY VINYL CUSHION LIKE STAMPED PATTERENED LEATHER VERY COMFORTABLE AND FIRM. I LIKE THEM IN MY BAR
3,review of expresso stools,these are nice stools for the moneythe seat cover is a little bit thin - we already managed to get a hole in one of them
1,Do Not buy this K&N filter.,"I purchased this K&N; replacement air filter for my 2005 Porsche Boxster, and all I can say is the word nightmare.Once I had the engine exposed, which is a feat in itself I was able to remove the original air filter in about 2 minutes.I then tried to install the K&N; filter for over 2 hours with no luck.I don't think it is actually physically possible to install it, as the filter end will not go over the end of the air intake.I cut my hand up as well.My advice is to just order an OEM replacement filter and install it yourself.I called a Porsche dealer who wanted over $100.00 just for the labor to install a replacement air filter.Do it yourself and save money."
1,K&N & Amazon Problems,Item arrived poorly packed. Item had broken clamp so I couldn't install the item. K&N will replace the clamp in 7 to 10 days. Great to spend money and get a broken item-won't be ordering anymore from Amazon since their solution to the problem wasn't any better than K&N's.
1,DOES NOT FIT!!!!,"I have referenced K&N; website to make sure that I order the right part number. I work on my own car. Only reason for me to take my car into the mechanic shop is because I don't have the proper tools and it cost too much to buy my own. In short, I am pretty handy person. After 2 hours of trying, I have came to the conclusion that this filter simply does not fit! Make sure you get the genuine filter from Porsche dealer.What a waste of time and money. Now I have ship the part back for refund where I pay for the return shipment cost. I have used K&N; for all my cars past 20+ years. I suppose there is always a first time..."
4,Excellent book to read to toddlers,The pictures in this book are very colorful. The story is cute and my four year old enjoys listening to them.
4,Very Good Read,"Excellent historical account of Livia, wife of the Emporer and uses all historical info at a time where the writers rarely provided info on women. Must have for anyone that has a Library of Ancient Rome."
5,perfect for camp stove,I use this on the wood stove in my wall tent. works great and is the perfect size. handle works great for moving it a round
1,Tighten Up,"Just another commercial product, made to give you a false sense of confidence, but truly does not work."
4,works pretty well,"I purchased this product to spice up my love life. After my sons birth, things were not nearly as tight as they used to be. I applied it 15 minutes before intercourse and was pleasantly surprised. I was very skeptical when I purchased it. It does tighten things up, but it isn't virgin tight. I am pretty pleased with this product."
3,Intel BOXD915GAGL Motherboard,"Below is a copy of my e-mail from Amazon.com, order update.Intel BOXD915GAGL 915G LGA775 MAX-4GB Ddr Matx PCIE16 Pcie 2PCI Snd Lan Sata Sold by: [...]Condition: newThe merchandise received was what was ordered....sorta. It arrived sooner than expected and undamaged. However the product was advertised as ""new"" and I've never known ""new"" Intel boards to be sold in plain brown boxes or the board drivers to be burned onto unlabeled TDK CD's. That said, the product functioned as expected when substituted/installed in place of a like board whose capacitors went bad."
4,the raid,It was a very good and surprising movie i loved it it has everything suspense action and a surprising twist
4,True to Goodness Action Movie Treat.,"The Raid is a surprise hit as it sets a new bench mark for action flick. It is filled with loads of good fighting action which few Hollywood movies can match. The story line is simple yet entertaining. The acting which is not as great compared with Hollywood as most of the cast are not the ""A"" listed. It is worth a watch and I purchase the Blue Ray Disc without regret."
3,"Plenty of action, martial arts and plot twists","The plot was unpredictable and the action was nearly constant. The characters also seemed fairly realistic as everyone made mistakes or in the protagonist's case, at least he wasn't indestructible like in many other action movies."
4,More action for your money!,"The action starts from the opening title and doesn't slow down until the end. I got the unrated version, so I viewed many scenes through my fingers. Some of the special effects left me in awe wondering, ""How in the world did they do that?!"" I recommend it."
3,Dubbed,"This was filmed in Indonesia. It was dubbed in English by well-spoken men with perfect voices. I use subtitles, but I wanted to hear the native language. The dubbing was excellent most of the time. It had lots and lots of killing and gore. I'll give it three stars for that."
3,"Good fighting/action scenes, storyline is lacking.","Let me just start off by sayin this movie in Blu-ray format was hard to come by at my local stores in town so I bought it on amazon based on the reviews about the fighting scenes. The fighting scenes are good but the acting/storyline is pretty bad. If I was to compare this movie with Ip Man it would be no contest, Ip Man is probably one of the best fighting movies of all time. But this is a watcher for people that like martial arts."
4,action x3,"action strait through, every time I blinked or my named was called i had to rewind.the promo delivered what it promised.just be sure to keep up on your reading."
4,"No frills, all thrills","One of the best martial art movies I have seen in recent times. Tight story-line and crisp direction keep you glued to your seat till the movie is over.""Pulling a trigger is like ordering takeout"" ~ Mad Dog"
1,Expired too soon,It expired before I had a chance to watch it.I think if I rent it I should be able to watch when ever I likeNot expire in a week or two (I didn't start I understand the 48 hour time frame)
1,Not so good..,"This was one of the worst top 10. The acting was bad, the script was bad. Too much profanity in the wrong places as well as the fighting was horrible. What were they fighting for???? The whole movie didn't make sense or have direction. Don't waste your money on this, like I did to rent from Redbox."
2,Big Disappointment,"I saw many positive reviews for this movie so I rented it. I now believe those positive reviews were paid for because this movie is at best ordinary. Rudimentary plot, bad cinematography, sloppy stunt work and a general lack of creativity. The fights were not interesting and often looked like rehearsal fights from movie extras.For a martial arts movie the violence is only average. There is nothing in this movie worth watching again so I would not buy it at any price. The inflated reviews are the only interesting thing about this movie."
1,The Raid,"Not much to say about this one because I didn't watch it, I did rent it but if I wanted to read I would have gotten the book."
4,Great action - but thats about it,"The action was great, better most so-called martial arts movies, but it had definite flaws in the story. I did enjoy it but expected more."
4,Ummmmm...,I would have gave 5 stars but when i put the DVD in it started scratching. The description said It played fine.. I wiped it and it stopped scratching.
4,Action Packed,The fight scenes are awesome. It has a good story and great soundtrack. Full of bad asses and guns and swords.
3,Did not surpass my expectations,"After watching ""The Raid Redemption"" and comparing it with movies such as, Kung Fu Hustle -for the martial arts- and the goriness of I Saw the Devil and The Chaser, I have to say I was not all satisfied with this movie. The plot is very simple, predictable and somehow weak, the action is OK and I am all for Korean or Chinese movies with real martial arts and goriness. Sorry but this movie is not what I expected base on the Amazon's reviews."
3,It's no Ip Man,It was good. Action was good. Plot was ok. Overall it was ok. Wish I didn't buy it. Definitely a solid rental.
3,so so movie,has lots of action in it but not much of a story line.could had been better but the action made up for it some what.
4,Kewin great movie,"It was a great movie, just wish it was in english.It had a lot of action and the story line was great. overall I it 4 stars"
5,Bad a**! what action should be.,"Awesome, bloody, kinda cheesy, skips story to get to action. you like pure action, check it. its worth a watch."
5,Awesomeness,Awesomeness Action packed movies arrive on time and great quality love the movie Love movie lots of action lots of action lots of action. Loved it good movie
4,Good martial art scenes,Excellent martial art fighting scenes. Action was pretty intense from beginning to end. Having the plot all take place within the apartment complex was an interesting concept and kept the intensity level pretty high. Be prepared for a ridiculously high body count!
4,"Tight, tense, violent dance of action!","Not for kids. This film is a non-stop ballet of pornographic violence. It is so well done you can't stop watching, and the music score really keeps you pulled in. Like seeing a car wreck on the highway, you just can't look away."
5,Best Movie Ever,"Love this movie, it is one of the best action movie I had watch this year. I can watch it over and over again!"
4,Great action film from Indo.,"Brief and to the point: if you enjoy hardcore action films like ""Time And Tide"" (one of the best ever), ""District B-13"", ""Fulltime Killer"", ""Police Story III: Supercop"", ""Ong Bak"", ""Tom Yum Goong"", ""Chocolate"", ""Born To Fight"", ""Ip Man"", ""Invisible Target"", ""So Close"", ""Death Trance"" and ""Unleashed"", then this Indonesian film is a must-buy. My wife is from Indonesia and she did the literal translation even though English subtitles are provided and get this: all the ""cuss"" words in the subtitles were never spoken in the film; amazing ain't it? The character ""Mad Dog"" played by Yayan Ruhian (He is a beast; look out Tony Jaa, Jet Li, Wu Jing and Tak Sakaguchi). Highly recommended and a must-buy for action and martial arts film lovers!!!"
5,"Blood Drenched, martial arts madness, Action flick!!!","Well, I must say, renting this was a waste of $3.99....Only because I now MUST purchase the blu-ray!!!! I won't go into great, explict detail about the awesomeness of this movie, plenty of reviews have already gushed lovingly over The Raid. I just wanted to, deservingly, bump up it's rating. If you're a fan of action flicks you will love this."
5,Great movie!,I loved this movie!! Awesome fight scenes that don't feel choreographed! Best martial arts movie I have seen in years.
2,Silly Movie,"No plot, but lots of gratuitous violence. If Tarantino interest you, this is a must see. Not his work, but someone who obviously thinks the world of him."
5,If 10 stars were possible...,I would give it an 11. If you enjoy any kind of action/martial arts movie why are you reading this when you should be watching this movie!? There is literally one word that will describe this entire movie: INTENSE.
3,oriental judge dredd,"Very similar in plot to the new Judge Dredd, but it lacks nothing for action. Fast paced and gritty, should be a good watch if you like martial arts and bullets."
2,The Raid,"We actually did not finish watching the movie. The title was appealing to us, but there was so much shooting that we gave up on trying to find out what would happen at the end. It might have been a good experience if we would have passed through the ""gun fights."" If one enjoys gun battles, this is the movie."
3,Eh,"The movie was alright, the story was less than I expected, and I'll be honest. I wasn't really expecting a story.None the less the fight scenes are pretty goodI felt that sometimes they were a bit lengthy, but I got over it"
3,Not all that great,"This movie got old pretty fast. If you're looking for a nonstop action movie then this is for you. But besides that, the move wasn't that great. I couldn't bring myself to even care about the characters or story in general because I found them lacking, which made me not care too much about the movie as a whole. Sorry, but I don't think I would ever watch this movie again."
3,a few beers watch,the movie had good fighting in it story was ok the dialog was way out of sinc with didn't help the wovie but it was ok to watch with a few beers if there nothing else to watch. willie
3,It's OK,"After the great reviews by large numbers of action fans, I went ahead and bought the bluray edition. It's an ok action movie but just. The lip syncing is horrible and the color is very bad. The action seemed forced, but there was lots of it. I couldn't connect with any of the characters. The extra features were done well and those alone are the reasons I'll keep the disc."
3,An Indonisian Action Flick by a Welsh Director?,"You might have thought you had seen it all: Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Jet Lee, Donny Yen and so on. Not really. Gareth Evans and his team came up with this simple premise, lean budget, unfamilar location, unknown actors but with weeks of intense tactical police training and just about the right amount of blood and violence, the filmmakers came up with some of the best choreographed hand-to-hand combat sequences, long, almost non-stop and never boring. 4 star for the action sequences, 2 star for the story and 3 star for the filmmaker's ingenuity and love of the genre. Mike Shinoda provided the unobstrusive soundtrack."
4,The Raid:Redemption,"I believe the this was a good action picture with a nice story line with a little twist to it, but for the most part it would have been better if it was in just english. I was a little lost cause when I read Im not as focused. I watch facial expression while Im watching a good film such as this"
4,Shoot 'Em Up,I did not watch this movie but my husband did and was actually pleansantly surprised by it even though he hates subtitles. He is still begging me to watch it with him just so he can watch it again!
3,not the words of an illitterate kitchen-boy,"this is an amazing sutra, well worth reading, but keep in mind that hui-neng was not a harvard educated man with a enormous vocabulary. my guess is that hui-neng spoke using much more simple words than are employed in this translation. this sutra is not about snooty, rich person vocabulary, but rather that a dishwasher can become enlightened (it is of course ""about"" many other things as well). this should not be forgotten upon reading this wonderful sutra."
2,Below Average,This book had a decent idea but thats about it. It was a chore to get through. Quite boring and hokie. Don't waste your time.
4,perhaps some software has improved since then?,"Been 6 years since the book came out. But the experimental procedures described in it should still mostly be relevant. Enough details are given, and references to journal papers, that an experimenter can learn and use the microarrays.The text also explains the software and underlying algorithms for analysing results. Some might well have been improved in the intervening years. The ever increasing computational power and cheap computer memory means that more intensive analysis could have emerged, to enhance processing of results."
3,Incomplete Product Description,"These installed very easily on my HELLA 550 fog lamps. I wanted to have protection from stones and other debris while still having access to the lights without having to get out and remove the factory white stone shields. These covers do not seem to inhibit the performance of the lights.However, be aware that this product contains ONLY ONE stone shield. I suppose this is desired if you have an odd number of lights. It would have been nice for this information to be in the product description.This seems to be a bit expensive for just one stone shield; but, if it works, it works, and I'd rather pay about $35 and have more convenient and protected lights than have no stone shields and have to buy another $100 set of lights."
3,At least it looked cool...,"I just purchased this power supply because it stood out from the others with its attractive clear acrylic design, dual fans, and numerous lengthy connectors. I arrived home and installed it in my case, plugged it in, and pushed the power button expecting to see it come alive and light up my case. . . nothing. No power, no lights, nothing. I wrote Logisys tech support and I hope to hear back with an RMA number. All the tech reviews of this product have been great - so if you do purchase this item make sure you're aware of the 60-day warranty and the return policy in case you too get a dud."
1,not enough detail,Seller does not provide enough details. What is the output power of each voltage? I need 24A on the 12 V rail. Why would I buy this if it is not listed?
4,PWS-Power Supply Clear,"I have been using it in a Dell OEM PC to replace to the standard bottom of the line one they give you. It has been working great. No problems with the fans, no noise or power fluctuations."
5,A Clear View,B@dd3st @55 c@s3 p0w3r around... HEY! You want a better view...open a window...put it in a clear case and trip out...yea b!tch3n b0x...with little green snakes & B!g Blu3 l!ght...who needs TV
4,Leo and Huntz end up in the Air Force by mistake.,"This is the 31 rst film in the Bowery Boys film series. For this review, I will list the approx. age of the Bowery Boys. Leo Gorcey 38, Huntz hall 33, David Gorcey 32 Bennie Bartlett 33. Bernard Gorcey's (Leo and david's father) plays ""Louie"". The gang believes their friend Dave (Todd Karns) who is in the U.S. Air Force and came to down to visit, may be in some trouble he can not get out of. So Leo and Huntz go to the Allen Air Force Base to visit Dave. When they get there, Leo wants to go where he thinks its the right location to see Dave, but they end up in the recruiting station. A beatiful lady sargeant asks them to fill out the forms. Then they under go tests. They think its odd to be going through all this just to visit Dave. The lady Sargeant tells them this is just a routine examination to be a ""rookie"". Boy, they know the word ""rookie"". They know their goose is cooked. Some how Huntz ends up in the ladies barracks."
1,Disapointed in design,"I got this bag thinking it was going to be a great bag. I was wrong. The wheels are way too close together thus the bag constantly flips on it's side. Because of this, holes have rubbed into the bag in a couple of places rendering the bag useless. My stuff won't stay in the bag for falling out of the holes. Maybe if the bag was redesigned with a wider wheel base it would work. Until then buyer beware."
4,My 2 cents,I have never read Bill Pronzini before. What a waste! This is a well written book that keeps the readers engrossed with a narration style that is simple and interesting. The book narrates the protoganists escapades with 3 perfect crimes and the aftermath of how he copes with them. The book keeps you hooked all the time from end to end. I have already started looking for other Pronzini's works. Don't miss this book
1,Travelogue or novel?,"This is the first Bill Pronzini novel I have read. I am not impressed. There is very little dialogue and lots and lots of ""filler"". He wrote page after page of instructions on sailing using terms the average reader is probably not familiar with. Then there are (what seems like) hundreds of pages of description of the island of St. Thomas. The plot is very thin and there is very little character development. If this is a sample of his writing, then I won't read another of his books."
1,Insipid drivel,"Is this a thriller or a travelog? It reads like your brother-in-law droning on about his vacation to wherever. The characters are predictable and trite. The plot is about as challenging as driving the interstate. My first Pronzini, and my last."
2,Not as advertised,"Received my order promptly, but did not receive at all what was described. No tin at all, but a box with not 6, but 4 envelopes with tea. Have not yet tried the tea, but it smells good... Have attempted to contact the company to inquire and see if maybe I received the wrong product? Apparently I need to stand on my head, rub my belly and wiggle my nose simultaneously in order to get a hold of a representative. Will not be ordering from this company again, even if the teas are good."
2,Not what was pictured,"I was very disappointed when I opened this package. I was hoping to give it as a gift, but it is too""cheap"" to do so. There are only four pouches, not six as stated. I'm not sure of the flavor quality, but will comment after trying."
2,"""Tins"" means Tins, not envelopes","""6 Tins"" arrived as 1 tin wrapped in paper and 5 envelopes of teas. This was intended for my spouse who was looking forward to the decorative tea tins, apparently more than the tea itself if his ire and insistence of sending them back is any indication.I'll be sure to write a review about the tea itself after this gets worked out."
2,No tins.,"The product is a gift so I do not yet know the quality of the teas themselves. But, at the time of purchase, there were references to 'sampler tins'--the product actually has none and is instead four resealable bags of tea."
4,Good book for new or visiting hikers in Michigan,Well organized book with lots of useful information on 60 hikes throughout Michigan (excluding upper peninsula). Gave this book as a gift so I can't comment on the actual hikes.
5,griddle,"this will make breakfast, lunch and dinners real easy at my cabin. This will hold a ton of food to cook and what tastes better than food cooked outside during the summer?? This will get a lot of use up in Cle Elum cabin on the river"
3,Somewhat disappointed - food sticks,"Bought this based on the reviews. Heats quickly and evenly, fits well on the 2-burner stoves, has a convenient handle to set on and off the stove top. But the biggest problem I faced was that the food sticks. I bought with the intention to use it as a non-stick surface."
4,Griddle good for cooking breakfasts,Works especially well for breakfasts on the griddle. Plenty of room to cook for a crowd. Watch for hot spots under direct heat source.
4,Gang Griddle,"Got this for our dble burner camp chef a couple of weeks ago to take camping with us. Very good design. I cooked breakfast on two days for 5 people. 5 pound of bacon, sausage, hash browns, pancakes and french toast. The trough does a good job. I just wish the hanger for the grease trap was a better design, but that is not a major problem. This thing is very heavy duty. If you drop it on your foot, you may have to amputate. Can be seen at Gander Mountain along with other Camp Chef products."
4,Callie & the Dealer & A Dog Named Jake,"This book has everything! A wonderfully troubled heroine running from her past, a body in the freezer, a killer on the loose and finally a hurricane to top it all off... It kept me on the edge of my seat and I cried at the end."
4,Great sense of place,"Great sense of place - the Outer Banks of North Carolina - and great sense of danger with a hurricane roaring down on the hotel where a murderer stalks his victims. The present story was intricate and tight, but I felt that the action was a little slow at the start and insertions of back story were often abrupt and needed more development."
3,Clever but light-weight exercise,"Coover's brief tale takes a paper-thin premise and runs it right into the ground--yes, it's yet another one of those self-indulgent, self-conscious post-modernist novels seldom enjoyed by anyone who isn't an undergraduate English major. It's a very short book that you will likely wish were shorter. But though the plot goes (by design) nowhere, and the book is stuffed with the kind of affected whimsy employed by writers far too impressed with their own intelligence, there is some witty, bouncy prose to enjoy and a few inspired comic moments. For what it is, it's well put together."
1,"It may be lit'rary, but I cannot like it","I did not care for the endless repetition with minor variations. I did not care for the one-sidedness of it all--man gets off, maid is out in the cold. I did not care for the endless repetition with minor variations. One had the feeling someone was trying out a lit'rary exercise and it got published by mistake. One had no sympathy for any one in the book, and one felt one was overcharged."
4,I built the rocking horse on the front cover.,"I built the rocking horse on the front cover of this book. It turned out pretty well. The drawings in the book are fairly easy to follow. However, the written instructions have some holes in the explanation. In addition, the instructions imply that stationary power tools are recommended for this project, but hand-held tools would work as well. I seriously doubt that this horse could be built properly using only a hand-held jigsaw and electric drill. The precision required to do this project *right* really call for bigger tools. One other gripe - after moderate use in the workshop, the binding on this book started to come loose, and a couple of pages came out.But overall, I was pleased with the project and hope to build some more toys using the plans in this book. It was worth the price just for the horse plans."
4,"Good, but doesn't delve into","Good because it clearly separates analysis from design matters. The five layers-four components approach clarifies what must be done, when and where the results must be put, but it remains an overview of the design process (just the central part of the book is really dedicated to it). It's a good companion to OOA by the same authors. Useful the list at the end of the book either about analysis and design indications to follow to develop projects using their methodology. The chapter about the programming languages contains various syntax errors. I consider this the last in the rank of the three books (OOA, OOD, OOP)."
5,Music to my ears!,"The Jupiter was purchased as a replacement for a saxaphone that was created back in around 40AD. No matter how perfect my 13 year old son played, he always accompanied the school band a 1/3 note off. When the band teacher told me there was little hope, we searched for a much better-suited replacement and chose the looks and styling of the Jupiter. FANTASTIC choice!! Most definitely, Music to my ears!!!"
4,You learn about the Good and the Bad Women in this little book!,"I chose this book to use for my Sunday School class of women. It is an Easy lesson book because we read from the Bible and then answer questions about the woman and reflect on how this lesson can be applied to our lives. I think we are learning from the lesson. However, the lessons only take about 30-40 minutes. Each lesson is a woman from the bible."
1,disappointed again,"I'm not sure if it's something about my knee, but so far I haven't been able to find a knee support that does not bunch up behind the knee, cutting off my circulation. This product also did it. It was very uncomfortable and I couldn't wait to get it off."
5,Brilliant,"It's expensive to buy nowadays, but well worth the money. I bought this new when it came out in 2003, and it continues to be one of my favorite trance albums of all time (I've been a trance fan since '98, so I know what's good and what's not). Both discs are incredible and well-produced. There are many memorable tracks from that era combined with lots of great ones that you won't find on any other album. it's hard to go wrong here. I really don't understand the previous ""3 star"" review - ignore it."
3,"Great game, OK starter","Diskwars L5R, despite being out of print, is one of my favorite collectible games and I still play it regularly. The Naga starter is a fine product for s starter, but the Naga faction is a little weak in the game. If you're looking for a single starter, go with the Scorpions instead."
1,Lousy book,"This book is very poorly written. This book doesn't define terms, doesn't bother to explain things, and just goes into incredible detail on things that leave the reader lost. I've heard it said that it's for a graduate audience. That's no excuse."
2,Microbiology,"Good book. Information was easy to follow. But the condition I received it in was terrible. It was advertised as ""good"" but had writing and marks all over it from head to toe."
1,A Classic shown in poor quality,"These are one of the best Bewitched shows shown. It is something that I would consider a classic. Unfortunately, it has been made on a rather poor quality tape. Not only is the video of a poor quality, but the audio make the viewing very un-entertaining.I would not recommend getting these tapes."
1,A Violent Book About Anti-Violence...,"While this book has good intentions, I found it to be the most violent book about anti-violence that I could imagine. The text is not so bad, but the illustrations gave me chills. I thought it couldn't get any worse (guns, knives, etc.), when I came to a page where a little boy was lying in a pool of blood hugging a teddy bear. In my opinion, this is not the kind of book that should be viewed by any child, let alone a child who needs a book about anti-violence."
4,Perfect ending that leads us into the novels.,"Vol 9 MR returns the Pencil and Inking people I have liked the least in this series. But this was their best effort and is one of the 3 best comics in the 8 TPB series visually. The characters are drawn with sufficient detail so that there is little confusion on who is who, which was a problem in Vol 8.As good as the artwork is, it is still not up to the best that Dark horse has done so it get a 4.The story is an important addition to the further understanding of the characters that will appear in the novels to come. The story is the perfect ending of the series of comics and leads us right into the novels. The novels will take us to the conquest of Coruscant and ultimately the defeat of Ol'Iceheart.This is a solid 4 star comic and I strongly recommend it, with a ps. For Mr's. Nadeau and Crespo. I accused you of lazy art in previous work. Very good job here."
3,It's a Comic Book,"While I only have myself to blame (attention to product details), this is not what I expected. I was looking forward to a novel that I could read on the plane but instead have a 90 page comic book that was classified as a paperback. For $13, it's not worth trying to return. I guess bookstores do have some advantages."
5,"A manual for how to successfully manage everyone, not just Gen X'ers","While this book is purported to be a manual in how to manage young people, the advice can be applied to the management of all employees. If you are a manager, you must:*) Not expect people to work extended overtime with little or no compensation.*) Praise employees for work well done.*) Not expect people to work at jobs that lack an inherent meaning.*) Set an example by your actions and words, not just your words.*) Allow people to have a life outside their job, not expect their job to be their life.If you do these things, which should be part of the standard managerial playbook, then your employees will be more productive, happier and you will retain them. If you don't, you will become one of those managers who blame everything besides incompetent management style for the fundamental problems of their company."
5,Great PSU,"A perfect PSU. No problems. Comes with plenty of cables. Great cable organization. Keeps system very neat. Voltages are rock solid with no fluctuation. Virtually dead center of desired range. The 12V supply is literally at 12.000V and never moves. No issues with sound. Not the cheapest PSU, but worth the extra."
1,DOA,"Mine was also DOA. Wasted and afternoon trying to figure out what was wrong, then tested against known good PSU and everything worked fine."
2,bad quality,"nice moduler capability. quietbuild quality is below par. after over a year of casual use, the main 24pin power connector becomes finicky. after doing some diagnostics, came to find out that the 24pin connector wiring connection has degraded. you have to wiggle it left and right in order for it to turn on. must be the internal copper wiring coming loose. this shouldn't happen, and after years of building computers, i've never ran into a PUS where the 24pin connector goes bad or degrade after use."
1,Antec quality control completely absent,"Amazon promptly delivered above-captioned PSU, which was dead when plugged into MoBo.Amazon promptly delivered a second unit, which was DOA. Confirmed status with a PSU tester purchased the same time I installed a PSU from a different manufacturer.Amazon return policy is first-rate!Antec quality control is non-existent."
2,I couldn't use it...,"The supplied brackets wouldn't get it mounted on any of our three atvs. I had planned to make my own brackets to mount it, but realized there isn't enough access to my handlebars due to all the other equipment strapped to it. I never got back to it, and decided that I'm apparently okay without it. As for the windshield itself, it seems like a fairly light, almost flimsy, piece. I've used motorcyle windshields for years, so maybe this one only comes up short when compared to them. It has a thin little trim piece that runs around the outer edge of the windshield. It doesn't seem to have been attached with any glue or other adhesive, as it comes off very easily. I'm basically just not impressed with anything about it, though I'm sure it could be of some use to someone."
2,A little bit too concise and sketchy,"Varian's book, without a major rework, is definitely starting to fade. The chapters are too short. The mathematical appendix is ill-written, and some of the chapters are ridiculous, like Econometrics. The time spent on those chapters could have been used to futher develop general equilibrium and game theory. I can almost go so far as to call this a master's level book. Mas-Colell is definitely the benchmark, but if you are still uncomfortable with the math level, then try Jehle/Reny...This book may be a little less daunting than Mas-Colell, but it contains excellent chapters on the relevant topics, a good math appendix, and even a brand new chapter on auctions and mechanism design. As for varian, there are many other better books now, so I would recommend one of those unless you want a sketch of micro theory."
4,"Good introduction, only this.","This textbook works wonders for graduates students in law, management science. It is easy to read. But if you're a PhD student, this book won't be the best, you need books like Mas-Colell (Microeconomic Theory) or Debreu (Theory of Value: An Axiomatic Analysis of Economic Equilibrium). This book is just too cursory in treating game theory, social choice, and also general/partial equilibrium."
3,The accompanied ppt slides have many mistakes in some parts,"The major complaint I have is not against the book itself, but the slides prepared for instructors. I used this book for the first time for last semester. My students want the lecture slides posted one day ahead of time. When I prepared for the lectures in more depth on the day of the teaching, I will usually find mistakes in the slides, then I had to correct them during the lecture. not only that, the notation in the slides is often different from the book. Then guess what? many students complained that I am unprepared in their teaching evaluation, and liked to use different notation from the book.The second complaint is against the book itself. On dynamic games, the book gives a wrong definition of the equilibrium. Instead of showing a player's strategy as a contingent plan, it likes to call the action profiles an equilibrium. It does not kill the whole book, but it can confuse those students who do not come to lectures."
2,Not good if MWG is your main text,"My graduate micro text was Mas-Colell,Whinston, and Green, and I bought Varian hoping it would help fill in some of the gaps since micro wasn't my thing. But Varian didn't help me at all. It explained the very basic content, but those aren't too bad to get from MWG. As for anything not surface level, it didn't help at all. If you're looking for help with MWG, try Kreps or Sundaram."
3,High level of abstraction. University math degree needed,"I read this book, and I have a pretty good level in mathematical calculus management. But in this book you are meant to know very well matters like topology, theorem construction and demonstration, and so on. People who need something like a handbook in economics may have difficulties when comparing this material with real world situations. But academics seem to like very much this book."
2,A little too concise...,"I bought this text to supplement Mas-Colell et al. (MWG), and was pretty disappointed. Yes, it's concise, but I think that Varian really sacrificed complete and quality explanations for the sake of brevity. Not recommended - best to just wade through MWG."
2,"Not very tasty, sadly","Tasted too much of bacon, which might be the flavor, but in this case was over-powering. Disappointed because we needed a product like this that tasted good."
2,Good for reference BAD for tutorial,"With a limited budget i thought this was the best buy around. Think again! While this book does have excellent step by step picture references (as is admiringly the case in the Visual QuickStart series) it has no real projects or TASKS to get ones teeth into and actually CREATE.So, bottom line for me (completely new to 3D and Maya) is i want a book that is task-based - not just a glossary of 'how-to's'.I will return this book and keep looking. Best wishes narrowing down what YOU want!"
4,Track titles wrong,"First of all the review - WaxTrax fans won't be dissappointed. I gave it 4 stars because there are three songs I am indifferent to, but the rest of the album I like.Secondly and the whole reason I decided to post anything - the tracks listed here and other sites (including CDDB) are not in the correct order. I am also a big fan of Joy Division and Dessau's cover of Isolation is great, so you can imagine my surprise when the track called Isolation is not the cover, but then when I played Sun 90 I heard Isolation! Anyway, here are the correct titles:1. Suffer = Party Zone2. Thanksgiving = Beijing3. Spinning on My Head = Unshakeable Remix4. Move Seoul = Suffer5. Skeletons by Nature = Thanksgiving6. Isolation = Spinning on My Head7. Cull = Move Seoul8. No Way = Skeletons by Nature9. Sun 90 = Isolation10. Party Zone = Cull11. Beijing = No Way12. Unshakeable Remix = Sun 90"
1,"Ugh, nothing ""historical"" about this","I have a hard time with a historical novel primarily about a young girl's life when the author emphatically states that he went out of his way to avoid reading her autobiography. How on earth do you write accurately about someone when you won't even listen to their own voice. I realize that cannot take what an autobiography says as gospel, but it should at least be on the must read list for any historical author worth his salt! What's left here is a modern day girl grafted into a historical period to make a trendy YA novel. Young readers deserve better than this."
4,Great!,this is a novel about Napoleon's days on st helena. the heroine Betsy befriends the emperor which turns out into an amazing story. a great read perfect for history lovers and not.
1,"too ""modern"" ideas were inserted in Betsy","It will appeal to young female teens but the historical setting and female perspective will alienate many teens, especially reluctant readers. Also I several issues with the story itself: first it was slow reading until the middle, second even though it is historical fiction I felt that too many ""modern"" ideas were inserted in Betsy and several of the other characters, some of those issues would not have been dealt with in that matter, especially the frankness of sex and premarital sex, at that, lastly the lack of historical accuracy when dealing with actual events and people always poses an issue with me. I feel that there should be some responsibility and accountability for truth even in fiction; particularly when Betsy attempts to help ""Boney"" escape even at the cost of another's life, the author even admits that there is no evidence for this."
1,I could not finish this book fast enough!,"It sounded like an interesting enough YA book. Betsy Balcombe, a resident of St. Helena, returns home from her London boarding school. St. Helena, you might recognize, was one of the islands Napoleon Bonaparte was exiled too. Betsy arrives home only to have Napoleon arrive several days later, and with his lodgings not yet finished, he is sent to live in her guesthouse. A relationship begins between the two, and while I'm pretty sure the author was trying to create a friendship between Betsey and Napoleon, I found it sort of creepy that Napoleon would want a purely platonic friendship with a fourteen year old. Putting that bit aside, the book moved incredibly slowly, and while I kept expecting things to really pick up, they didn't till the very end. By that point, I just wanted to finish."
5,Exceptional balloon book,"Briefly put: Format exceptional, well written, entertaining, and quality balloon creations await those who purchase this."
4,Super Sexy,This jersey is super duper sexy for the true Jets fan. CM28 is my favorite Jet player of all time and this jersey says just that.
4,Great Stuff,"My dad always told me about watching this on pbs when he was really young. I've always loved dp, and this was, is still is another amazing outing by the master's of medieval-baroque based hard rock. One thing that could make it tons better (but is waaayyy too late now) is Ian Gillan"
2,"Songs are classic,a DP collectors score,poor recording!!","This recording is really for the hard core,I happen to be just that.I got it hoping it was worthy of made in japan or live in concert but was sadly mistaken.it has some classic DP,but the recording quality kinda sucks to be frank.If you really just want another notch in the collection belt buy it but dont open it.if you really want to rock out and remember the day,try Deep Purple in concert,that one kicks a**. sincerly TJW-DP-FAN"
3,"thr recording is not really good, what happened?","I have the video edition of this show in 1974, I suggested that you should buy the video not the cd! The film was a great show in 1974 with amazing guitar blitz, you cannot see, if you re listening to the cd."
2,An important document improperly done...,"The live material of mark3 here is top-notch,however the sound quality is far from acceptable,bringing this record down to the level of a bad bootleg.This material deserves a better studio treatment."
3,"Great performance, bad recording quality","The California Jam is an historically important gig in Purple history...April 6, 1974, wherein the Mk 3 lineup of Blackmore/Coverdale/Lord/Hughes/Paice took America by storm in front of about 300,000 people at an outdoor show. Blackmore destroyed a TV camera and blew up most of the stage, having to depart by helicopter to avoid arrest. But this disc captures little of that exicitement. There's some great playing and singing to be found, but, frankly, the poor sound quality (tantamount to a lackluster bootleg) means that this disc gets precious little time in my own CD player. If the sound quality was up to par, it might actually warrant a 4 rating. Hot spots include Mistreated, where Mr. Coverdale really sings (and Mr. Blackmore really plays)."
4,i wish i was there,"i had this show on video and I watched it so many times i just cant get enough you have to see it !!! If I could be in one gig only through all history I would be in this one .Ian the drummer plays like there's no tommorow {I dont know what kind of a drug these guys just took ,but it works good}I gave it 4 stars because the sound on the cd is not that good, it's better to buy the video"
3,caljam74 a worthy purchase!,"this cd is worth it .taken from the legendary california jam concert,features the vocal talents of david coverdale &glenn hughes,bass ritchie blackmoore guitar,jonlord keyboards,ian paice drums the songs are very diff from thier studio counter parts,but if youre a true purple fan .that means buy it! sure the sound quality is a little ruff but remember,it was 1974! & no doubt a soundboard recording. as far as sounding bootleg, thats rubbbish!this line up would never be repeated,& this cd is definately worth it! not a great cd but not bad either!"
1,"Pay attention, people..this is the BOGUS recording","The infamous Deep Purple California Jam appearance in 1974 hasbeen sought after ever since it was recorded. In recent years,three different sources of the concert audio have been released and this is the worst of the trio. It was recorded from the ABC-TV ""In Concert"" video, and sounds hollow and flat; as if it were copied with a Radio Shack tape recorder and a hand held plastic mike. I don't know what everyone else reviewing this miserable disc is thinking, but the only decent source for this show has been released as ""Just Might Take Your Life "". It's the original 16 track remote truck recording, which has been well recorded and properly mixed, mastered. Yes, this is a damned fine performance..but ignore all the ignorant kudos here; it's the worst sound quality of three different releases. Get ""JMTYL"" !"
2,Raw is the word,"I bought this disc out of curiousity and I wish now that I hadn't. This lineup has Coverdale and Hughes, and while Hughes is always cool(he could have easily done the lead vocals for the entire disc)Coverdale is way too raw for my ears. Either he was drunk/stoned/scared or he simply chose to sing that way. For me, the vocals ruin the disc despite the bands otherwise good but jam inspired performances. Sound quality won't win any prizes either. For the hard-core completist fan only."
1,Rufff!!!!!,"Fortunately I just borrowed this from the library prior to buying it. Yuukk! As much as I like the band and the great performance, this has to be the worst recorded CD that I've ever played on my system. Someone at a record company was looking for some ""money for old rope"" with this one. Big dis-service to fine musicianship"
5,"wow, this is a guitar burning explosion !!!!!!!!","yeah I know this cd soundtrack, and I also watched the video live of this one. The whole songs like Burn, might just take your life, Smoke on the water are timeless songs. The video version is still available, if you like Deep Purple. And I guess another DP fan from Konstanz Germany is right with his opinion. The things started into sour, as DP hit the stage. At the final song space trucking Ritchie Blackmore concentrated his anger at the end of the show to the ABC camera man, then he smashed his strat to the camera lens and burned the half stage and the amplifiers......the fire had almost blow him self on air! This cd is absolutely marvellous performance what Ritchie blackmore ever did in 1974. There were no bad songs in this album,....the Ian Gillan's replacement was at that time with David coverdale on voice. He had a capabillity and God knows how many good actions Deep Purple ever did that night. LONG LIVE DEEP PURPLE!"
4,Good quality,"Very good quality acrylic magnet. Just be sure you realize this is a magnet for your fridge, not your car."
5,Still Excellent,"I just re-read this book for the third time. Honestly, it keeps getting better. Part of that is b/c Denton doesn't always write for the masses and therefore many of his points are more deeply appreciated only after more familiarity with evolutionary theory. After this past reading I also realize how much his book has influenced other popular anti-darwininan writers, such as behe, wells, and johnson. I was also amazed at how many points parallel ones made by Dawkins: numerous instances where they use the same concepts and metaphors but derive very different conclusions. quite illuminating.in short, a must for anyone interested in the ""evolution debate""."
4,interesting,"until recently I never thought a critique of evolution would be even mildly interesting, but denton makes very valid points. If you're interested in perhaps the best critique try the hard to get Darwinian Fairytales by David Stove. There is nothing quite like it in the debate literature. One wonders why it is so impossible to get hold of, I assume it can only be because of its heretical nature."
1,A book full of distorted reality,"Any fool who tries to deny evolution of species at this point in scientific understanding, DOES NOT deserve to be published. Go join the 'earth is flat society'"
2,Which side is Denton with?,"This book could have been considered a great science book maybe. I am not a scientist. I am curios and I read. Evolution is the most controversial subject of all times. And I believe it has great value both in scientific terms and ideologic terms. Denton's simple style, flow of information in the book and his perspective is fantastic. If Denton at the end does not offer a new look into how living things came to be which he does not then people are right to label him as creationist. You cannot be a creationist and a scientist at the same time. You cannot make Noah's Flood reasonable and be a geologist at the same time. This is so simple. Science is trying to explain things and has a evolving nature. So one thing claimed now may not be true tomorrow. This is not the case for religion. So Denton has to put stg into the table."
4,Do materialists really know where they stand?,"It seems to me that many materialists are unaware of the nature of books such as this one. This book does not deny that we have evolved. Rather it states that the theory of natural selection alone lies on shaky grounds if every phenomena of life is to be accounted for - including nervous systems, brains and consciousness. Materialists claim that evolution has revealed that our existence is an accident. This is a personal belief - not a conclusion from evolutionary science. If anyone claims that it is a scientific FACT that the blind processes of natural selection has given rise to brains and consciousness, then they are muddled indeed, and they will be unaware of the extent of their faith and personal beliefs. This book is more on the ball than many materialists apparently know."
3,Evolution: A Theory Evolving to Extinction,"This insightful and thought-provoking book makes a great beginning in the evaluation of what most of us have been saturated with in our entire educational experience: hydrogen to homo sapiens by random chance to no apparent purpose. Read in conjunction with Behe's Intelligent Design; C.S. Lewis Mere Christianity; Ken Ham Answers In Genesis; Henry Morris Genesis Flood; Hank Hanegraaf Farce of Evolution; Lee Strobel Case For Faith; James Kennedy Solving Bible Mysteries - all will open the mind to other options that can't help but lead to new personal insight and growth. This book does a great service to challenge his audience to renewed vigor in critical thinking skills and to examine all the evidence - religious, historical as well as scientific. Metaphysics seems to hold the key to the validity of evolution as a viable theory into the 21st Century. Let the research and further investigation continue!"
5,A MUST!!!!,"This totally proves evolution wrong. It shows,from a molecular level,that evolution is a lie,and it's basic methods are false also."
2,"Not terrible, but still makes elementary errors.","While Denton is clearly a good writer, and is able to convey most of his points clearly, his book fails to raise any substantive challenge to evolution. Many of his criticisms -- his attacks on standard, well-documented transitional forms, for instance -- rest on the same factual omissions and logical errors as are found in some of the standard creationist literature."
1,140 years without Darwin is long enough!,"Denton in this book tries in vain to debunk evolution by natural selection. However, in the process he displays a complete misunderstanding of how natural selection works. Read this book if you are a creationist wanting to comfirm that your views are ""right"". If you you are looking for an objective critical appraisal of the evidence available, this ain't the place to find it. This book is almost too painful to read."
4,A penetrating critique of neo-Darwinism,"Denton's strength and originality lies in his sections on molecular biology, which whilst now dated, still make valuable and valid reading (in fact his case is stronger now as he anticipated).His principle argument is that far from bolstering the case for Darwin as is too often idly claimed, comparison of gene and proteomic sequences strongly confirms the typology of Darwin's opponents. Why? Because no ancestral pathways are found between anatomically similar species, in fact there is an almost mathematical beauty to genome separation between them.His writing is lucid, persuasive and well illustrated. A good antidote to Gould or Dawkins' myth spinning."
2,"Better than creationist books, but still not that good","Michael Denton's book does not make as many errors or non sequiturs as the average anti-evolution book, perhaps because Denton's qualms about evolution are - uncharacteristically for an anti-evolutionist - not ultimately motivated by religious dogma. Nevertheless, the ratio of bad to good is still unfortunately high in Denton's book. His chapter on fossil transitional forms is particularly disappointing - it appears almost as though Denton has ""learned"" about the fossil record entirely from creationist literature.Denton's book makes more worthwhile reading than the works of Philip Johnson or Henry Morris, but defintely does not represent the best there is to find in anti-evolution literarture."
5,"Heretical, But Wonderful","Denton writes wonderfully about the problems with Darwin's theories. I knew of some of them, but was unaware that one of Darwin's inspirations was Malthus, a cruel and wrongheaded character whose theories were not only repugnant, but have been proven wrong over and over again. Perhaps this is the scientific manifestation of the ""domino theory"". The vitriol coming from Darwinians is somewhat of a surprise and very disturbing. Where is the love of scientific open inquiry? Thank you, Professor Denton, for keeping scientific discussion open and alive."
2,Poor Company Response,"The product leaks from the supply line in and out of the housing. I asked for a replacement kit of O-rings, recommendation from plumbing contractor. They sent O-rings for the filter canisters only and now won't send anything else. They are asking for a photograph of the product because they do not understand what I am asking for.I have a hunch this may be a housewife with a hobby not a real business."
4,A wonderful surprize,"This is so far out of left field it will knock you over before you realize what's happening. It starts with a jet liner exploding in mid-air, then cuts to the lives of several people who were or will be effected by the explosion some years later. Westerners have comparitively little exposure to Indian film and to see an Indian film set in Canada, with one of the leads sporting a leather jacket and a switchblade is all too crazy. This is a wonderful movie containing stories that swirl around one another. A grandma who talks to The Krishna as he appears to her on TV, a modern Indian houswife excercizing to workout videos, a stamp collecting postman all help make up a collage of unforgettable characters. The colors are great. The scenes are imaginative and a couple of the female leads are as beautiful as anyone ever seen on the silver screen. This is a real breath a fresh air."
3,"Good idea, but . . .","By the way, ""pack of 2"" means that you get 1 pair of socks, not 2 pairs, as I incorrectly assumed. When I ordered these, I didn't know they were men's socks and intended primarily for post-surgical use. (I am a woman with very mild circulatory problems in my lower legs.) Even so, I find that these support socks do a great job of keeping up good circulation when one is standing or sitting for long periods of time, however, they are very heavy (think ""athletic joint support""). I like the open toe, since I find that support hose tend to make my toes hurt when worn for long periods, but the open heel is uncomfortable. Because of how thick the fabric is, if you do much walking in the socks, the edge of the heel opening rubs painfully against the back of your ankle. However, these would be great for airline travel, when walking is kept to a minimum."
2,slightly oversized diameter,"compared to same brand's ""regular"" style stocking, this one seems to run large, providing much less compression than the ""Futuro Support Socks Men's Dress Socks, Black, X-Large/Firm"" that I also bought. While the latter's XL size is perfect for me, I exchanged the XL of this open-toe style for a Large, and find it's still not quite as firm."
2,OPAQUE with little compression,"I just started to work in a hospital and I'm on my feet constantly. My feet get swollen, my legs get tired, and on top of all that I can get a little squeamish. I really love compression stockings but the seams just DIG into my toes at the end of the day. Even if I wear them inside out. So I was thinking I ought to buy toeless stockings and wear regular socks over them.Yeah, totally didn't realize when I saw the picture that these stockings are OPAQUE. And they aren't smooth, they are quite rough and leave a nice quilted pattern look to your skin. They extremely warm, I feel like my legs are being hugged. This is great for winter, but horrible in the summer.Pros:No toe seams digging into meCons:heal seams dig around my heal and get more painful during the daytotally opaquedoesn't offer a whole lot of compression compared to the stockings"
1,Not as good as old style support sock.,"I started wearing Futuro support socks almost 25 years ago because my doctor found blood clots in my right leg. At that time I tried Futuro and liked them. The ones I used had heels and toes in them. I cannot find these support socks anymore, and Futuro does not show them in their ads. The Futuro support socks on this page fit loose, even though the measurement of my calf shows they should fit. Since they fit loose they do not give much support.Futuro, please bring back your old support socks, they were great, or at least change your sizing so that the socks fit better."
5,Support Hose,"For those of us who must resort to support hose, these are great; the open toe and heel mean you can wear sandals and flip-flops with no problems and still get the support your legs need"
4,Easy on and off for arthritic hands,"These support knee highs are easy to use and effective. A caregiver can put them on, a process that is sometimes difficult with regular support hose. The open toe and heel are a comfort feature, and thinner sox can be worn over these hose to match clothing."
2,socks,they are good for what they are. i found them too heavy and short in foot covering.i prefer the old style much more.
1,short and expensive,"For the outrageous price one gets a very succint introduction into the habits of the Icelanders, not entirely updated.It is very good for a two hours fun read for someone who does not really plan to visit the country. The amount of information given is more easily gathered through a TV documentary though, and anyone wishing real help should address oneself elsewhere.I would have appreciated more attention to the intercourse between foreigners and natives, not excluding the more friendly or even intimate point of view.The author exploits the customary habit of British essayist of making fun of every detail. He does it well and I found myself laughing at times, but puns in the end tend to grow stale and get in the way of information instead of helping one to memorise it."
1,Big...Huge waste of money,"The recent nerfs have taken a significant amount of fun out of the game. This includes nerfs to the wizards, monks and mod rods. This game is a pitiful way for Sony to suck more money out of you. It offers nothing more than more time sinks, which in turn adds more money to line Sony/Verants pocket books. I play a 60 wiz and have purchased this game, and have played in the the new ""planes"", Dont waist your time, and money folks. This game has become more of a frustration than anything."
1,Probably the worst thought out Expansion to date,"This is quite possibly the worst thought out expansion to the game to date. The addition of character flags has effectively cut off 80 percent of the players from even accessing the upper planes. Come play our game with your friends! Oh wait you can't because you can't get into the same zone with them..so sorry!This addition and the relative decimating of older zones in the game by the additions of higher levels, overbalanced players and spells, and bad experience modifiers has cause this game to become even more elitist than it previously was. Add to that the rediculous twinking and destruction of game balance in general through overpowered drops useable by anyone, and rampant exploits/powerleveling and you have a wonderful game to be enjoyed by any 10 year old haxxor who has no regard for others."
1,Don't waste your money,"I've played EverQuest for almost 2 years now. Planes of Power has nothing in it for a character unless that character is almost level 60. Even then, Sony/Verant is slowly but surely destroying this game. One example would be the recent nerfs (class wimping) of the Monk class and the Wizard and Mage classes. Also Sony/Verant's customer service is notoriously bad. This expansion is not worth it."
1,EQ soon to be replaced by EQ 2,"Planes of Power isn't bad, its nice to see Verant has addressed some travel time constraints with potports. Used to be you'd spend several hours if you wanted to get someplace, waiting on boats etc. Verant took their complaints seriously and three and a half years later we have PoP. If you're not high level, there's nothing in the Planes for you. If you are high level you've probably heard what you need about it from your guild.If you're thinking of starting Everquest, don't bother. Verant will be coming out with EQ 2 soon enough and even then with their habit of nerfing classes (monk class was made into gimps with most recent nerf), I'm in no hurry to play EQ2. Star Wars maybe. Though expect to see jedi knights nerfed three years down the line."
1,"PoP - the ""uber"" expansion","If you belong to a guild who can field 40 lvl 65 players for the hours on end to get ""flagged"" PoP is for you. If you are a casual player you will never see 50% of the expansion in its current state.PoP is generally thought of by the player base as unfinished upon release. Players were promised an end to mindnumbing timesinks that made up the Velious expansion and instead you have an expansion that is made up of nothing but timesinks.In numerous surveys conducted on class boards more than 50%-80% of the players responding had serious problems with PoP be it the flagging methods, loot distribution, etc.In general, casual players are cancelling accounts and many are blaming PoP."
5,PoP is god,"Okay, well, a lot of people have been whining about PoP, especially druids and wizzies, who feel that this expansion has killed their porting business. Got news for ya... this expansion does not make druids and wizzies expendable. Pop lets you port to CITIES. Druids can still port to places that PoK can't get you to directly (Emerald Jungle and Cobalt Scar, for example,amongst others). Plus, in a group, druids and wizzies are still essential for evac if the situation gets ugly. Druids are still needed to buff, and Wizzies are still awesome nukers. So I don't know what the whining is about. For your info, my main is a druid.Besides the ease to get around Norrath, PoP adds spells, great quests, and higher-level hunting. This is a GREAT expansion, no matter what class you play."
2,Know what you're getting,"Looks like it could be an okay expansion. You can fight the ""gods,"" so time will tell. Still, some notes. The box screenshots show Luclin graphics -- if you play the game straight out of the box you'll get old graphics. Not a big deal, but buyers should be told and they're not. Also, you can't go beyond the first zone in Planes if you're not high level. Nowhere on the box is this mentioned. Transportion issues should have been settled via a patch rather than an expansion."
1,About Infinity Amplifiers,"When i installed my 1st Infinity amplifier, it got toasted within 1 hour of using it. I didn't do anything wrong, it just plain shorted out internally. So I thought to myself, well maybe I just got a bad amplifier. So I sent it back to the manufacturer to get it repaired. When I recieved my 2nd one it sounded really good, but after about a month, the 2nd one did the exact same thing. It sounded good while it lasted, but don't waste your time with Infinity amplifiers. By far the worst amplifier I've ever had in terms of reliability."
1,Won't try Infinity again!,"I bought the Infinity 7541a because it was cheaper than the ones I was earlier thinking of buying. I was compromising on the cost because this would have been a secondary amplifier in my car to work independently and standalone source to my Blaukpunkt GT series basstube. I got this amplifier for a little less than $200, and within hours of installation I realized my mistake. This was the worst equipment I ever got installed in my car. The sound effects were pathetic, just plain loud noise was what it was producing. No clarity at all. So within few hours I got it exchanged with Pioneer's GM-D510M amplifier after paying $80 more, but then there was better quality, more output and above all- satisfaction! I don't know about the rest of the products from Infinity, but will not try this brand again."
1,Very disappointed,"I bought these after reading all the good reviews. I was not paying attention when I placed my order, because I did not realize that I would be getting only 8 pieces of candy for $15.00. Seems like a lot of money just for 8 pieces! I tried one of the candies today and if it wasn't for the pecans it wouldn't have any flavor at all. I will never buy this product again. Werthers has a far better tasteing product for way less the cost, and you get way more for your money."
5,Great service!,Quick and efficient service! I got the tag for my dog within a week. Great customer service with my phone call and online information. Thanks!
1,engraving is much too faint,"At least for the stainless steel tags, the engraving is very, very shallow and difficult to read. In fact, after only a couple months of normal wear, it has become nearly invisible. If my dog were to become lost, any rescuer would have a difficult time reading our address and phone number.This renders the tags useless for their primary purpose. I can't recommend this product at all."
1,Not about replacing cane seats on chairs,"I was looking for a ""how-to"" book on caning seats of chairs, not people. There was nothing in the description of this book that indicated its obscene nature. Now, Amazon keeps offering me all sorts of books of this type. I am sure that my age is listed somewhere so there is no need to check my age. This book was ordered by mistake. I guess this is a review of Amazon, and not this ridiculous, awful book."
5,Awesome!,"I received this book as a Christmas present probably when I was 8 or 9, and I LOVED it! I worked countless hours trying to figure out the puzzles and finding the hidden pictures. I'm now 19 and I still try to get my friends to read it. I definitely recomment it to any child that loves solving puzzles. Someone mentioned that they couldn't unscramble ""mynah bird"" and so they were a little unclear about the age range. The wonderful joy of this book is, you don't have to be unable to scramble all of the things to finish it!"
5,Good times as a kid,My aunt and uncle gave this to me as a kid for my birthday almost 20 years ago. I turn 30 this year. Upon finding it again and reading through the book it still holds up. The illustrations are bright and fun. The puzzle I had to solve again as I had forgotten the answer.
2,would not recommend,"This is far too wordy and does not have an interesting stroy line. Stay with anything by Graeme Base, instead"
4,Challenging Picture Search,"The text of this book is a bit confusing, but the way animals are hidden in the pictures is very good. I recommend it for 6 years old and up."
5,I love tea!,"The tea was fabulous. I got the sampler and the tea maker, and I am inheaven. The flavors that I have been missing are now found.Cleaning the tea leaves out of the maker are harder than expected. (I do not have a dish washer) But I bought a drain screen and wash it out to there.I love the teas, I love the maker. And the shipping and arrival were quick and easy. I will reorder from them again."
4,The Red Caduceus,"The strong part of the novel takes place in Viet Nam. The descriptions of the war, people's attitudes, the geography, the paradoxes, etc. are authentic and brought back memories. According to the introduction, it was written as a tribute to medics and certainly accomplished that goal."
1,MOS does it again,i love a cd full of 2 min songs. i love listening to a 1 min intro and then hearing the transition to the next song just as this one is getting going. MOS has a history of cramming their cd's too full of songs just to have them on the slicker. serious trance listeners should demand better.
5,Incredible DEATH/BLACK METAL!!!,"Necrophobic have crafted a real classic here.It is more than deserving of five stars.It is insane that no one else has reviewed this. You should buy this if you like real metal. Black and Death Metal infusion of darkness, every song is awesome and i raise my chalice of blood to these guys, great stuff. Blinded by light, enlightened by darkness..."
3,go with newer williams and sonoma vegetable book and debbie madison,go with williams and sonoma vegetable and debbie madison's vegetarian cooking for everyone. for some of the old 1960's standbys like in the book up above.. believe it or not look up a book from helen corbitt.
3,Big case,"I have a Sony W200 and I bought this case thinking on protection. After few travels, I realize this is a big case and is not practical at all, at least for travels. I suggest to buy a case that could be fit on your belt."
3,Something different than you're used to,"Ed Mott'a Poptical is a funky soulful Brasilia jazzy record. This is some good music coming from a balding middle-aged Brazilian soul singer.It does sound like a Steely Dan record in terms of backing music, which is great if that's your thing. Ed posesses a soulful singing good voice, nothing too overpowering but still pleasing on the ears. Portuguese is a pretty language to listen to being sung.The only drawback is that some of the slower songs drag a little bit. However, overall I would say it's an enjoyable album though. 3.5 stars."
2,"Received a used version of the item, not new,","Received a used version of the item with wear marks and a burn from someone's regrinding the ball wrench flat they apparently rounded off from tightening or removal. May not effect functionality, but item was supposed to be new. Amazon's return options do not provide an apt choice to describe this problem and either assure replacement with one that is new, or issue partial refund for used item."
4,good enough for the price,"works good enough for what i use it for. it sputters a bit, can make a little bit of a mess it ur not careful with it. if u just want a pump so u dont have to pour stuff from a heavy gal container go for it, but if u want something maintenance free that wont drip a drop then look for a more expensive pump."
2,Drips agave on my countertop!,I use this pump in a gallon bottle of agave. It serves its purpose- it pumps just fine; BUT it does drip the agave all over my granite countertop... annoying!
1,Leaky,"My Chihuahua love their Trout Oil, but this pump leaks all over the place. I have to keep a bowl under the bottle of oil and collect the wasted trout oil This is a really poorly made item."
3,Straw too short,"The pump fit my gallon containers fine, but the straw part is too short. It's almost as if the shipper took scissors, cut one straw in half, then put each half in the two pumps I bought. I'm really aggravated. Once the product in my gallon containers is half gone, I'll no longer be able to pump it out. Not cool at all."
1,don't bother,"Takes about 6 pumps to get an ounce out. I bought it to dispense 2oz doses of oil and I wish I hadn't. Takes a dozen pumps.Waste of money.If you want something that dispenses a TINY amount from a gallon jug, then maybe this IS for you but for me, this was a FAIL"
5,Super Handy Convenience,"This is one of those purchases that I put off buying, but now that I have, I can only kick myself for having waited so long. It is a small convenience that will just make life less stressful, and make small tasks go more quickly so you can get on with more important things. I purchase a lot of items in bulk to save money and this product makes them easier to use. I purchased this for Alba Botanica Emol Body Lotn-Unscntd Gallon, as well as for bulk shampoos and conditioners. Great Bargain for a handy product!"
5,Spot on item,I found it difficult to find mini-DVD that will work with my video recorder. These worked perfect every time and I haven't lost a disc yet! Some of the other name brands would not 'close' the disc and I lost too many videos before switching.
5,Great Gift,Bought these for my wife Tammy... She loves them. Great price for all three and she was delighted. Nice quality
4,Tammy Triple Feature,"Great movies. Unfortunately only 2 were in the case when there were supposed to be 3. So, I only received Tammy and the Bachelor and Tammy and the Doctor. Tammy Tell Me True never arrived."
5,Gotta love the classics!,"I had been looking for Tammy and the Bachelor on DVD for years. So when I saw this one for sale, I was very happy. They just don't make movies like they used to and even though I love some of the new movies, every once in a while I just have to watch something that is classic and this is one of my favorites."
3,Classic entertainment,"I purchased this for my wife who remembered the movie from her child hood. Really she remember the theme song. We watched this together and I must admit that there is nothing like a good old movie. Really enjoyed Tami with Debbie Reynolds, the other 2 films were copies of the first with a slight twist."
2,Triple feature of Tammy movies,"Arrived timely and packaging good. The sad part was that the ""tammy and the Dr."" was missing from the features. The Tammy and Bachelor was great to see again. Wish they still made them like this!"
5,Tammy and the Bachelor/Triple Feature,I like all the Tammy movies. Reminds me of when times were slower and more simple. When people really enjoyed each other and took the time to visit.
5,Debbie Reynolds Tammy at last available on DVD,"I readily admit to being a fan of Debbie Reynolds. Not only was she one of Hollywood's prettiest actresses and the ultimate girl next door of her era, she was also incredibly talented. Yet for some reason, despite her terrific looks and talent, few of her movies have been made available on DVD. Now we finally get her performance in Tammy and the Bachelor as the first of a set of three Tammy movies, in two of which Sandra Dee is cast as Tammy.I liked Sandra Dee, but I bought this DVD set to see Debbie Reynolds as Tammy again. After I watched Tammy and the Bachelor -- and thoroughly enjoyed it -- I played it again, and enjoyed it again. I hope that more Debbie Reynolds movies will now be released on DVD. She was special."
1,So Disappointed,"Ordered this DVD at the same time as another from Amazon, I recieved that one in a few days, but I NEVER RECIEVED The Triple Feature of TAMMY AND THE BACHELOR, which was coming from another vendor! I got lots of correspondence from them, when I didn't get it. But NEVER RECIEVED IT. I wonder if it was EVER MAILED.I AM SO DISAPPOINTED!"
1,Tammy And The Bachelor/triple feature,This is advertised as a three dvd combo when in fact there are only two movies.Tammy And The Bachelor / Tammy Tell Me True / Tammy And The Doctor (Triple Feature)
4,In Love with Tammy,"Fun to see Leslie Nielsen in a serious, romantic role. He does a great job. Debbie Reynolds is luminous as always. Her musicality lifts the theme song to a level that is luscious, timeless. ""Tammy and the Bachelor"" is definitely the finest of the three films on this DVD. But the other two, starring Sandra Dee, hold up surprisingly well. I bought this DVD as a pleasant stroll down memory lane and was stunned to find my 13-year-old niece and nephew glued to them. And not in a campy way - they truly enjoyed them. Almost made me sad that there is so little in the movies that treats love and romance as sweetly as these dear old films."
5,Tammy Movies,Great movies that are clean about romance...I remember watching these movies when I was younger and now it is a pleasure to share them with my daughter.
3,"Bam, there goes the cover","This is most definitely a ""Dutch Oven"". Big, roomy and sturdy, that is except for the cover. Very poor design on the cover! A screw and not a real sturdy one at that hold secure the knob. The first time I used it the screw stripped and the cover starting to twirl around the screw. In addition, the paint is chipping from the knob. Besides that the pan is very useable. It will need to be treated after some use but that is normal."
4,Great Pot,This pot came in a timely manner and it was just as pictured.I am from Louisiana and grew up watching my parents cook with cast iron pots and pans. I love mine and would recommend this item.
2,Falls a mile short of good,"Coetzee writes well and excellently develops his borderlands theme. That said, ""Waiting for the Barbarians"" too often resembles the lewd fantasies of a dirty old man rather than a literary masterpiece worthy of a Nobel Prize. Think ""Lolita"" instead of ""Blood Meridian."""
3,Waiting for the Barbarians,"Shipping time was great but unlike all other used books rated as in very good condition that I have purchased via amazon, this book had extensive underlines, highlights, and margin notes added by the previous reader. Such notations are problematic and were unexpected. Otherwise, the book was in nice condition. The seller is new so is likely learning."
3,Barbarians,"The book was in good condition, but had many, many notes written in it. I didn't mind this most of the time, as the notes were somewhat helpful to my own understanding of the book, but they were also distracting and sometimes irrelevant. It would have been nice to know before I bought the book that it was written in, unless that is assumed when purchasing a used book."
2,Well meaning but derivative.,"References are to Cavafy (for the title) and Dino Buzzati (The Tartar Steppe) for the concept. Good enough in its way, but the Nobel prize is not justified. Poor Kafka has a lot to answer for."
3,Hmmm,"At first I was totally down. But then the author began to change his tune in a way that made it less of a novel and more of a poetic personal reflection, which is ok, but not what I was into. The reading was for a Lit class. Not my favorite."
4,a terrible beauty,"The spare beauty of Coetzee's writing is almost unbelievable. Though his subject-matter is brutal, Coetzee's prose remains so lovely and restrained and self-aware that it breaks your heart. I have yet to read anything by this author that has not amazed me."
3,Good,"""Barbarians"" is striking on many levels - as a novel, a warning laid at the feet of humanity and as a tract on principled martyrdom. The writing is patient and fine, even though it is clear that Coetzee is more concerned with morality (and psychic pain) than he is with ripsnorting storytelling. The tale is a good one - majestic and large - but it sometimes gasps for breath under a gelatinous blanket of soul-searching. Could be that was his aim all along."
5,Utterly brilliant.,"Coetzee is South Africa's most compelling writer. His prose is hard and precise and his stories crafted with a sharpness that cuts to the quick.""Waiting for the Barbarians"" is profound and powerful. Bleak and desolate at times, but sparkling often with rare luminosity.The magistrate is a character that embodies a particular dillema during Apartheid, or any period of opression. What to do? What to risk? What is our moral responsibility? It's an uncomfortable question flung at a world often so enamored with comfort it refuses to act against injustice. Unless it suits them politically.As a writer and South African, Coetzee remains for me a constant inspiration on how to address the troubled past. There is redemption and bleakness, despair and small joys.Coetzee knows the complexities and doesn't stoop to easy answers. If truth be told he is the South African most worthy of the Nobel Prize."
4,Complicity and resistance,"This superbly written short novel deals with, amongst other issues, the question of complicity with a regime that one is part of but does not actively oppose. What is the moral weight of our actions when we act within a system? Are our actions tainted by being part of that system, even if we do not actively support it, simply by not actively opposing it? As a South African growing up in apartheid South Africa this question has particular relevance, although it is by its nature generalisable. Likewise, questions relating to how oppressive regimes create the needs for oppression, and how racists create justifications for oppresssion are thoughtfully and subtly explored.This is an excellent book that provokes a lot of thought about the nature of oppression, civilisation, complicity and resistance, good and evil, and oppressive regimes, without being preachy or difficult to read"
4,Bleeding what is spoken with what is merely thought,"I like the way Coetzee writes dialogue -- terse with no quotation marks. Many times what is spoken and what is only thought bleed together beautifully. Many other writers use this device, Cormac McCarthy springs to mind, but I find Coetzee bar none."
2,How depressing can it get?,"I appreciate this is an Pulitzer Prize winning author. However, when you're ready to read this book make sure you've had a great day. You'll need that and perhaps a stiff drink!Coetzee repeatedly describes every thought that comes into the main character's head and every movement of his body until I wanted to scream ""I get it!"". And often ""I don't care"". I do acknowledge the importance of his multilayered messages: colonialism, man's inhumanity to man, the superior attitude of western society, etc. But by the end I kept hoping for some glimmer of hope - that I could actually make it through the end and be put out of my misery."
3,Good storyline but too preachy,"Waiting for the Barbarians is a good novel, very well written, but Coetzee really tries to make a point of what ""civilization"" is coming to which got out of hand. It seems like he wrote the book just to tell the message and that the storyline was created in the process."
4,very deep,"I have to say that this book, though slow at times, tends to linger in one's mind. It's not just about the apartheid regime but rather about all civilizations. Take that for what it's worth. Nevertheless being that it's realistic it doesn't have an ending, but for someone who has lived life that ends up being the most realistic part of all. Read this if you want to be moved to think about the darker side of man."
4,"""Says a lot without using too many words""",One of our favorite authors. It is a short read about a magistrate working for a corrupt colonial empire isolated at the edge of civilization. It is Orwellian at times-a real Man vs. Society thing-and really a case of an author saying a lot without using too many words. The subject is dour but it has been named by Penguin Books as one of the top 100 novels of the 20th century. The political undertones are more than pertinent today.
3,Dissatisfying,"This is a well written book, but for me the story was not strong enough to carry the message. Sure, it offers some interesting insights into the nature of civilisation, power, and ambition, but the total abstraction of the setting robs it of sufficient human interest. The Empire is not set in any place or time, either fictional or historical, and virtually no-one in the book has even a name. The story feels far too much like a vehicle for a message, and even at times just the message itself.I was also puzzled over the nature of the main character's supposed rebellion, since from the perspectives of both sides he didn't seem to have done anything of consequence. For a more gripping account of power, ambition, and empire, with plenty of human interest, I would recommend ""I Claudius""."
3,Save yourself some money!,"This book has been re-printed under the title: Championship Collections; How to Squeeze Blood From a Turnip. It sells here on Amazon for a cover price of $25.00. Don't pay these outrageous prices (like I did) for a used book.By the way, if you're new to collections, this book is a good introduction. If you need specific collection techniques, buy another book."
1,Buy this book only if you want to read short stories,All this book does is tell short stories. It does not provide much assitance for collecting debts.
3,Printer delivery,shipping was very slow ans very slow to get confirmation of shipping but the broduct did arrive and is working well at this time.
5,"I don't understand the negative reviews, I love this printer!","I've had this printer for 3 years now. The amazing thing is I havne't done any maintenance whatsoever, not even replacing the ink cartridge. I'm the only one who uses this printer but I do use it quite a bit for my home based business. I have a Brother fax machine that needed ink replacement w/in 4 months, but this Samsung printer works without a glitch in the 3 years its been in service. That is the quality I have come to expect from Samsung products.Yes it is loud, but no louder than other laser printers I've dealt w/at the office. I don't print graphics so I can't comment on that. But the text is smooth like you would expect from a laser printer. And it is plenty fast once it warms up!"
1,Noisy....Not happy with it,"It is very noise, so I need to turn off/on it every time. After one year, it sticks often."
5,So happy that I threw out my ink-jet!,"I have had this printer for about four months, and it is a joy to use. I print word processing documents and web pages, and they look great. I have not yet used up the toner cartridge which comes with the machine.After suffering with poorly performing ink jet printers, I gave up color and found performance instead. This printer is not particularly picky about how I load the paper. It has not (to date) jammed on me at all. And the printer doesn't care how often I use it-- I get the same results no matter what I do. I am astonished to have such a reliable machine at this pricepoint."
3,Noisy,"Very noisy. So noisy that I have to turn it off when I'mnot using it. Of course, this means that I have towait while it warms up every time i want to use it.Otherwise, no complaints (but I just got it; we'llsee how it stands up to the test of time)."
3,"Good printer, but TOO noisy","I've had the same problem as some others here...NOISE. In particular a high pitched whine that stays on for about 10 minutes or so when the printer is powered up. I think it's the fan thats the culprit. I thought it was a bad unit so i sent it back and the replacement had the same annoying whine.Otherwise an excellent printer. You can print a stack of envelopes and postcards and it's fast too.C'mon Samsung, quiet this baby down and you've got a kickass printer here."
1,For light use only,"This product is best for those who have only an occasional need for a few copies. It is very noisy, gets very hot after 20 copies, curls the paper severely making 2 sided copying difficult, and paper jams are the rule rather than the exception if making more that around 10. We are also experiencing a lot of garbled jobs at times that waste paper by spewing out incomprehensible jabber on paper. When it does work, on small jobs, it is fast and the print is clear. Right now we are experiencing an inability to obtain a compatible toner cartridge at either Office Max, or Office Depot. We are exploring an on line purchase of toner, but we needed copies yesterday. I would not recommend this for anyone unless the price and foot print are a perfect fit. I think most of us under-estimate our printing needs and, when the time comes for an moderate sized job, you will find yourself with a lot of wasted time and paper."
3,decent urban exploitation film,"this wasn't too bad. not quite as violent as the DVD packaging advertisements suggest, but still fairly violent and bloody... i would have liked more though. especially since ultra gory conflict is the reason to buy a film like this.what i didn't like: the story could have been more compelling. for instance, gang gets ratted-out to the police, when they come back from the police station they are irritated enough to lay siege to the entire building. that's the whole plot.the characters were interesting for the most part, but really they are just stereotypes. it would have been nice to see some character development other than good guys versus bad guys. and maybe a rival gang thrown in for good measure?if Tenement had been either more over-the-top camp or serious urban gang warfare, i think it would have been a better movie.for fans of the 80's urban exploitation genre, i recommend it and would actually give it 3.5 stars.D"
3,GOOD,"Got item quick, packaged well and as described. Highly recommend you use this source for future purchases you might have."
4,Good book for a difficult topic,"""Your Body Belongs to You"" is a good book for adults to use to teach young children (2-6) about body safety. It can be an effective educational tool to prevent sexual abuse of young children, or as an aid in starting a conversation with a young child when sexual abuse is suspected of having already happened. We have used it at our Child Advocacy Center when child protective workers interview very young children about possible abuse."
5,Lovely book,"A book for very young children on how to avoid sexual abuse. Nicely written, very sweet, well-done illustrations. As a therapist who works with children who have been abused, I strongly recommend this book for children 7 and under."
4,Great intro to tough subject for preschoolers,"I have two girls (ages 4 and 2) and have been struggling with how to introduce the topic of inappropriate touching to them. This book made it much easier. It handles the subject matter-of-factly and with simple to understand terms. Children learn that it's OK if they don't want to be touched, that their private areas are those that are covered by a bathing suit, and that touching is never a secret. I think it's important to introduce this subject to children at a young age and this book allows you do so in a non-threatening, non-frightening way."
3,scared my kid a little,"My young school aged child was a little scared by this book, but the topic is important. I would still read it to her again (and will). Know your child, but your child NEEDS to know about this danger in a gentle way --- this book is a good place to start."
4,nice little book,cute way of teaching your child that their body belongs to them. not much else to say. I would of given it 5 stars if it was a little longer.
3,Just okay,I don't even read this book. Not right for what message needs to come across. I need something more then just kids playing
4,Shoes didn't fit!,"I was so disappointed when the size 7's arrived and they were too small. I always wear a 7 or 7 1/2. So now, I don't know how to order these shoes from you, and I would like to very much.Any hints?"
2,Didn't live up to its rating,"Enjoyed my first body pillow for two years and when it came time to replace it this one seemed like a good option. Within a couple of months it had lost a lot of its shape. Lumps forming, etc. Tried to regenerate it but no success. Surprised considering the rating here, maybe it's a QC issue."
2,Poor quality,"I got this after my boyfriend and I stayed over at a friend's who'd had one of these. We thought it was great and got this one. Hardly even comparable!! It quickly became flat, lumpy and without shape. I guess it's not something one should try to buy online.:("
3,Soft Pillow,This pillow is nice and plump but it doesn't give alot of head support. The first few nights that I slept on it I woke up with a headache. Now I use another pillow underneath which gives me the support I need and I have been sleeping much better. I especially enjoy the softness when I lay my head on the pillow to sleep. Every night I plump the pillow back into shape and its off to sleep I go. I was expecting a better pillow for the price I paid but it is working out fine.
3,pillow's much heavier than i expected,"it's comfortable but quite heavy so it's hard to move it around much. also, the gel separates so my pillow's kinda cut in half right now. bottom line: i don't really recommend buying it. i think you could find something better out there."
3,Not as good as the reviews i read,For the first two weeks pillow was great and fluffy and i wish my bed was made out this material. But now where i cuddle the pillow with my legs theres a crease that begining to form where my legs have been. It doesnt poof back up again. I am pregnant and i guess this isnt the pillow i should be using but i guess it will have to do for the next 4 months. Still need to get a pillow case though.
2,Too squishy....no support,I was trying to find the same pillows used in the Disney Beach Club and a few people had suggested these were the same--not even close. These pillows felt very squishy (no real support) and did not feel at all like a down pillow. I returned them and bought others that were more supportive at BB&B.
1,Like Sleeping with no pillow!!,"I read the reviews before I bought this. And I was very hesitant about spending this much money on a pillow- Well I should have gone with my gut and NOT BUY IT!!! When the pillow is laying out (not folded in half) it has ZERO support. It's like there is NO pillow there at all. Folded in half, there is a little support, but is still way too flat. If you are like me, and need a firm body pillow, PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PILLOW!!! I wish I would have bought a regular memory foam pillow, but sadly I wasted a lot of money on this when I will never use it."
5,My girlfriend loves it!,Got this for my girlfriend and she loves it. It's soft but not too fluffy that you lose the bulk of the pillow once its between your legs.
3,"Good, but not what it claims.","This pillow is fairly dense and heavy, but has no form of gel to it as the name suggests. It seems to be a regular fiber fill pillow, and according to the label it is 100% polyester. It's like any other body pillow I've purchased, only bigger and twice as expensive. I had pictured a mesh of gel and fibers that I would be able to fluff and conform, like down, but this is not the case. However, the first night was a comfortable one, and hopefully it stays that way for a long time. It's just not what I signed up for."
3,pillow talk,"this is a decent pillow for the money; it's still holding shape after 5 weeks - which it should! It does hold heat which is a serious drawback considering that cooling is supposed to be the primary selling point. The size of the pillow is great, your pillowcases won't swallow it up."
4,Its so fluffy,"So many times I bought a body pillow and within a week it becomes flat. This one stays fluffy. very comfy. There r some cons though. 1 is that it bunches up to one side. So you ALWAYS have to fluff your pillow so that the gel down inside would be evenly spread out. 2, Stitching is not that great. its been 3 weeks and i already know what the inside looks like. i had to resow it in order for the filling to stay in. 3, you cannot wash it. if you do it makes it very hard to get that original soft feeling inside. use body pillow covers!!"
3,Pillow talk,"I have ordered 2 body pillows now and can't seem to get comfortable enough. This one is a bit bulky, not like the memory foam, and feels like a bit sausage next to me. I have had it a few weeks and have used it 3 times; I am going to give it more time to flatten down."
1,Very disappointed,"I'm hoping I'm the only one with this problem. When I put the pillow into a cover I bought, almost 1/4 of the pillow's stuffing sunk down. After about a week, it slipped even more. The pillow is now about 1/2 it's size. Not worth the money; especially since it's not as dense as I expected. Guess I'll have to go to the store and buy extra stuffing to get it back where it was which is the perfect size for me. The size (when fully stuffed)is the only good thing I have to say."
3,Too Thick...,"Soft, compresses gently... to a point. When in use, sleeping on my back or side, it is just too thick. It doesn't compress enough under the weight of my head to allow me to be comfortable. Seems well made, great price, but I've already replaced them."
5,Worth the money!,Ok so you can get a crappy body pillow for like 10 bucks but this one is definitely worth the extra money. I wanted a body pillow for while I was pregnant and I had looked all over and only found cheap ones that wouldn't have held up. My husband works at a mattress store and sells pillows so he kind of has high standards. Unfortunately they don't sell body pillows so I decided to check amazon. The material this pillow is stuffed with is far superior to the $10 pillows you can find everywhere. Its so compfortable! I couldn't have made it though my pregnancy without this pillow!
4,Great for Pregnancy,Bought this for my wife. Great price for a great pillow. Wife moves it to wherever she needs support while sleeping. I have a feeling this pillow will continue to occupy our bed even after the baby. Good Buy.
5,Best Body Pillow I Have Ever Purchased,"I never write reviews on anything I purchase from Amazon, but this one definitely deserves it. I have bought many body pillows over the year. I sleep on my side, so I've always needed a body pillow to sleep comfortably. I have the same type of gel fiber king sized pillows and love them, so I figured this would be the same. It was delivered yesterday and I used it last night. It was exactly as I thought it would be...very soft and molded perfectly to my body. I had a great night's sleep!"
4,Good Size Pillow,"This pillow is full and alot better than the first pillow I purchased at Bed, Bath and Beyond. The first one I bought flattened out quickly but this one is holding most of it's firmness. The only spot where it does wear down is where my legs cross over. I do love sleeping pillows and will continue to use it after I am pregnant. It is large but doesn't take up too much room in a King size bed that your husband will complain. I've seen a lot bigger pillows that wrap around and I think this one does the trick nicely!"
5,1 year old and still going,I have now owned this pillow for over a year and it is just as good as the day I bought it. The pillow is beyond softer than any other body pillow I have come across and it hasn't lost any of it's volume like a normal pillow would. This is going to be my main christmas present this year. Love it.
1,poor qualilty,"After 1 month of use this pillow is already starting to separate and break apart in the middle. I like the solidness of the pillow. Sadly I'll be replacing this pillow in less then 6 months, definitely not worth the price I paid. I can do just as well with a Walmart pillow for $25 less."
3,"Okay for side sleepers, but great for back sleepers","I ordered this pillow for myself (side/stomach sleeper). At the same time, I ordered a buckwheat hull pillow for my boyfriend (side/back sleeper). They arrived on the same day. I opened up my gel fiber pillow and thought, ""Wow, this is massive and fluffy."" Waaay too much pillow for a tiny gal like me. My head bounced off the pillow like it was a trampoline. (It's like one of those massive hotel pillows.) My boyfriend fell instantly in love with this pillow, leaving me trying to decide what to do with the buckwheat hull pillow. Buckwheat FTW! If you're the kind of person who likes to ""mold"" a pillow to your head, and likes to sleep with your arm underneath the pillow, and you like a small pillow, the buckwheat hull pillow might be the way to go. If fluffy, gigantic, and cloud like is more your scene, the ""Beyond Down Gel Fiber Pillow"" is a perfect match."
3,Beyond Gel Body Pillow,"This body pillow is soft, fluffy, and heavy and is otherwise adequate to the task. However, the pillow ""sweats"" fluff because the gel fibers, like the goose down they are supposed to emulate, eventually work their way through the pillow's cover and onto clothing, bedding, etc. I thought this was just residual stuffing left on the outside of the cover, but after three pillow case changes and no visible holes or tears, I knew it was leaking fibers and decided to trash the pillow. If you buy this pillow, you'll have to immediately enclose it in a leak proof zippered body pillow cover so when it exudes fluff it will contain it and the innards will not get out. I really wish the manufacturers would place these gel fibers in a strudy impermeable cover so buyers won't have to do this or constantly clean up fibers which I'm sure aren't good to breathe or ingest."
4,I love this thing!,1.) It's soft but firm enough2.) You can move the filler around inside to suit your own needs3.) It was heavier than I thought it would be but I'm fine with that4.) It does take up a lot of room5.) Get a nice case for this! It doesn't come with one. I found a nice cheap on at target that's fleece-y and really soft.
2,Wayy to soft.,"I needed a body pillow that was firm. Reading other reviews I found on here about this product, I thought at last I'd found something decent. This body pillow is just way too soft. No word close to firm can be used when describing this product. Plus the product is only half filled with down, so if you hold it by its end, a lot of the actual pillow is just a pillow case."
5,Gel body pillow,"I bought one of these gel body pillows for my granddaughter and her Mother loved it so much that Mom would bribe the granddaughter a few days of the week to get to use the pillow for herself. So Mom will get her own pillow for her birthday. A good product, better than I ever expected."
2,A foot of wasted space,"When my pillow arrived, I was so excited that I went in my bedroom and tried it out. The moment my leg hit the top of the pillow, it sank almost all the way through. I tested it, and ended up having to grab the bottom, turn it upside down and shaken well. Because there was such a large section from the pile to the end, right around a foot, I got large rubber bands and twisted them in the bottom. Now I had a way to be comfortable, as long as you don't put any weight on it. It scootches. I wanted to lay on my other side, and thought how nice it will be now! The minute I put my back up against the pillow, it moved quite aways off. I tried to just put a little, to give the impression that there's someone on the other side of the bed.Since it has recieved several great reviews, this has to be: in my opinion only!!"
2,"Nice pillows, but have doubled in price!","I purchased this pillow a year ago and it's getting flat already. I paid about $26 each back then. I came back today with the intention to buy a new one only to discover that they have doubled in price! I thought $25 was a good price, even if they only last one year, but $50? No way! Don't waste your money."
5,A Great Pillow,"My wife and I are sharing this pillow. It lays across the head of the bed when we sleep. It feels amazing! I only wish it came with a cover for it. After a few weeks of use, it still holds it shape, still feels great."
5,Body pillow,Nice body pillow. A little too large takes room in your bed. But if you re sleeping alone its a good pillow.
1,Not very sturdily constructed,"Received the pillow and was pleased at the sturdiness and comfort - after only a week a corner seam just unraveled...nothing like waking up to a bed full of fluffy ""down gel"" fiber!Not really a big deal but I shouldn't have to get out a needle and thread after owning something for only afew days - the low rating is due to principle."
1,Flat,"I had read about the benefits of this pillow in a health magazine, where it had received a first rating. This pillow began to get flat as a pancake after only a couple nights sleep. It was touted as perfect for side sleepers. Not so! No support whatsoever."
3,does not last,had this product for 2 years now and the filling is almost completely compressed making the item worthless. was great while it lasted.
4,Great for the pregnancy belly (body pillow),"I am six months pregnant and this pillow has been my lifesaver for sleeping. Since I cannot sleep on my back or stomach, I have to get creative with the positions on my side. Being that my bed is only a queen and I have to share it with my husband, the other massive ""pregnancy"" pillows were out of the question. This one doesn't take up too much room and is certainly more ""lofty"" than some of the body pillows you see in stores. I recommend it!"
1,Sleep on your currency.,"I purchased this item because of the high reviews. I do think it's like ""sleeping on air"", meaning you might as well put your head down on 3 $20 bills for all the support it gives. I hate it."
1,Not so much...,"Hardly a ""friendly"" and ""introductory"" text. The language, examples and feel of this book are more suited for someone with prior training in this subject. For the student facing the unfortunate situation of having to learn with this text it may be better to get another book and learn the material from it rather than waste a large amount of time with this one. For folks who already understand the subject I'm sure it's quite good."
2,Meh....,"While the book is above average, it is hardly a ""friendly"" book. Probability is subject that requires practice and experience in order to gain confidence in your approach...This is the first textbook I have ever seen that doesn't have answers in the back of the book...not a SINGLE ONE. So, you can dabble around with a problem all you want and never be confident you have the correct answer.There ARE answers to the in-book quizzes available online, but the quizzes are often ""gimme"" type questions and do not have near the complexity of the problems at the end of the chapters.For These reasons, I have to give the book a poor rating."
1,"Not ""friendly"" at all!","I am a graduate student in Operations Research. This is my 6th class. This book is the worst book I've had so far! There are very few examples of how to apply concepts, no solutions to any problems, and huge jumps between the demonstrated problems and practice problems. The problems labeled ""easy"" are moderate in difficulty, and the problems listed as ""moderate"" are extremely challenging (as in hours upon hours). We won't even talk about the ""black diamond problems""! Unless you have a very abstract and deep understanding of math (despite the author's claims to the contrary) and an IQ upwards of 150 (like the authors themselves), you will not understand the concepts in this book. Interestingly, the authors mention in their introduction that many students struggle with this course (without realizing it is because of their writing)! Its a shame that mathematicians continue to ignore the education research that explains how people learn!"
5,Best book on the subject I have come across,"I have taken three classes on this subject, and I am confident in my recomendation of this text. For a first year M.S. class, I had the misfortune of having the instructor use Stark and Woods, which is overly complicated, dense, and in my opinion, the authors attempt to make the subject more difficult than it really is by including advanced topics, such as parameter estimation, in introductory chapters. This book, on the other hand, goes over all the basics in a very clean and presentable manner. I picked up this book during the class using Stark and Woods, and my performance increased drastically. This is an excellent reference and text for self study. A real life saver as well. Only complaint: it would be nice to have solutions to select problems. Most people will tell you that the only way to learn the subject is through practice, but as far as learning pricipals, this book is spot on."
5,A better book to understand Probability and Random Processes,"I have gone through many books, including the one by Papoulis, to understand the concepts behind Random processes. There was one of the 2 problems in each book: Either the explanation was very poor with very less examples Or the book was too mathematical. No book has addressed and corrected the 2 problems completely till now to my knowledge. But, this book has tried to provide very good reading for any person in electrical engineering as the name itself suggests. Highly recommended for students to have a quick grasp of the subject."
3,What I was looking for...,"This basket fulfills the requirement I had, which was to hold my shoes under my bed. However, just know that it is not the strongest quality material. The plastic bends easily and the wheels fall off on occasion. For the price, though, it's a good storage solution."
1,DON'T BUY THIS,"This product is defective - and I mean that literally. I ordered 4, so I know for sure my experience wasn't an exception. These have screw holes that are covered by the white coating on it, so you can't screw it together...screw holes not spaced properly, and the sizes of the pieces seem to be randomly mismatched...I don't know how it could have even been manufactured so carelessly! Putting junk like that on the market should be a crime. THAT'S WHAT WE GET FOR OUTSORCING TO CHINA!!"
4,Good but doesn't hold that much,"I had one of these a long time ago, when i wan younger. I think its a GREAT idea however, i do remeber it doesn't hold too much and if you put too much weight in it the bottom warps. It works perfectly for extra blankets under the bed."
3,Simplistic view of the Civil War of USA,"Copeland does a good job with his explanations of the events of the Civil War, but I think historians on at least the college level would grimace. The images are great and easy to color and the text is good for battles and participants in the war itself."
1,Overpriced for what you get.,"We ordered this book, new. It is basically a listing of names and addresses. No real info on each foundation. For the extra $30ish dollars - go with a real foundation guide that shows past donors, etc. Compared to other guides, this book was a ""phone book"" listing.The most unfortunate thing about this review is that we HAVE to give it a star - not because we want to - but because it is required by the form."
5,The best fantasy book ever written.,One of my favorite books of all time; Mr. Rosenberg doesn't bore the reader with silly fantasy names/terms/dry details like so many other books in the fantasy/sci-fi genre do. Buy this book and the others in the Guardians of the Flame series.
5,Often Immitated but Never Duplicated,"One of my favorite series of all time. And with the exception of the last few in the series, (they moved on to different characters), the most well written and engaging characters.The concept for this book has been done many times in comics, tv and novels. But no one ever did it as well as Joel Rosenberg! And the incredible thing: this book just sets the groundwork for one of the greatest extended tales I have ever read.This is a must have!This series is in my opinion, the absolute best fantasy series I have ever read. There is a level realism in these books that I find extremely interesting.Normal college students being transported to a fantasy world by a wizard/professor. How in the world does this work? And yet it does. In fact, his character, Walter Slovotsky, is one of the greatest characters ever written."
5,Great Fun and Quality!,My three sons love this hockey goal and sticks. We have had this set for a couple of years now and play hockey almost daily in the driveway. My husband and I join in sometimes too. I am buying our second set to put at the other end of the driveway and to have more sticks. I am very thrilled with this set and would recommend it to anyone considering buying. You may want to buy two!
2,Difficult to Assemble,"Despite having put together and fixed hundreds of toys in my career as a mom, the goal included with this set seems difficult to assemble. No matter which way we do it, (and HOURS have been invested so far) the net drags on the ground. We called the manufacturer who said we may have a bad net and would send us a new one, but we have yet to see it. So our set may be a fluke, but proceed with caution and patience.The sticks included with this set are definitely scaled to the ages 8-12. If you are thinking of this for younger kids, you will have to buy separate sticks...All in all it would be a good value if I could get it to work. I wish I had bought the foldable goal that has a center post. My set will probably be returned shortly."
3,some what good,"I bought this net a few weeks ago, I have an outdoor rink at my house and when you shoot the puck the whole goal just falls over because it is light. Then along with it falling over the goal kept falling apart, I had to super glue the pipes together. Then the pipe broke in half so now it it duct taped together along with super glue. Plus the hockey sticks are short I say they are about 48 inches, but which is good if you are 4 feet tall."
5,Great Value,I read other reviews before purchasing this product. This goal is sturdy and easy to put together. My son has been using it every day and most days I play with him. I would recommend this product.
3,Poorly handled,"The box this item came in looked like it had been poorly handled. Secondly, there was one extra stick but only one goaly stick. It was almost like the packing person was trying to make up for the fact there was no second goaly stick by putting in another regular stick. Very disappointing as this was a gift."
3,Goal!,The kids like having 2 goals. I wish you could buy 1 box with 2 goals inside instead of 2 boxes with 1 goal
5,Great quality and easy set up!,"We ordered this a a Christmas present and I must say, I am beyond impressed. I expected it to be a cheap toy that may last a few weeks. It is far from it! Great size for older kids and adults! The goal is thick PVC and Really sturdy. Sticks are solid wood handles and thick, hard plastic base. We will be ordering a second set after our move do we have two goals! Great product!!!!"
1,Do not buy this as a gift...,"it is shipped in the manufacturer box and has complete pictures and wording on the box. So the recipient, should they live with you, will immediately know what is in the box. This happened to me. The set was purchased as a gift for my 5-year-old's birthday and unfortunately, he was home when it was delivered, and now the surprise is ruined."
1,Rip-off,This was an absolute rip-off. Apx. $75 for a miniature cologne bottle. I returned the cologne to the seller and am still awaiting my refund.
3,good taste,"I forgot to mention this flavor in my traditional review. I told you the original was good. Well, this mix is very, very good. Flavor is excellent. Not too overpowering, so, everyone in the family loves it."
4,Excellent,"An excellent look at the Battle of Crecy. While strictly an history of the battle and campaign, this book is unencumbered enough to allow lessons learned to be considered for contemporary strategic thinkers/leaders."
2,Not fully accurate.,"Burne's writing is clear, but his 1940s English attitude makes for some odd turns of phrase. More troublesome, his penchant for creative interpretation of primary sources leads him to some unfounded conclusions. For example, his novel assertion that English archers were deployed in ""wedges"" within the overall battle line has been repudiated by professional historians including David Nicolle and Matthew Bennett. As one of the many amateur soldier-historians of the post-WWII era, Burne's conclusions are interesting military opinions but not quite academic-level scholarship."
1,BUY THE SKYRAY!,I gave this product 1 star for a very simple reason. The Tau SKYRAY box comes with the exact same pieces PLUS a new sprue for the Skyray missle turret! AND THEY ARE THE SAME PRICE! Dont buy this when you can buy a Skyray and swap turrets on it! A skyray is two tanks in one!
5,Excellent product,911 eye gel helps a bit when you need to compensate for a poor night's sleep or just want to improve on tired looking eyes.
2,Inadequate product description,"Sorry, but I saw the description ""Travel"" and assumed that it was a brand name (note the use of a capital ""T""). I was unaware that there is a special class of tote about pillows, for which there are very few covers or cases available. I can also see that I am not the first consumer that has failed the pillow buying test in this regard. On that basis alone, the vendor might try to have a better product description regarding its size."
2,wtf goose,"All I want to say is where the F is the goose? The picture clearly shows a goose. That is why I bought this thing in the first place. I mean what does one really look for in a travel pillow anyway? I don't know about you, but I am looking for a complimentary pet goose. When the box showed up with no air holes I knew there was something up. I thought to myself there better be a magic goose in that box that does not need air to breathe or else. Much to my dismay when I opened the box there was no magical pet goose, but only a standard non-magical travel pillow.The pillow is ok, but without the goose it is hard to make a judgement call. The two are obviously complimentary goods (in the economist sense)."
4,Excellent down!,These pillows are great to sleep on. More pliable than one of those neck rolls and always fluff right back in shape. No feathers stick out because they are down
5,That is the book,"For a long time I have been searching for an algorithm book which is comprehensible, easy to follow. This is the book, I am really looking for. The other books like ""Introduction to Algorithms"" and most of the others do not give the point of the subject, full of mathematics, strange symbols many unneccessary details, I think that the other authors must follow the approach like in this book.I wish that the author had also written other books containing the other advanced algorithm issues like network flow, linear programming... I would have bought without hesitating..."
2,Didn't last long.,"We've only had this tie for a couple of months and it's already broke. We used it with an arial line for my German Shephard. After about a month it starting curling and would wrap around my poor shephard's legs. I was constantly untangling her. She got used to hopping around the yard with her legs all tied together. Finally it wore thin in one spot and she broke it. She doesn't chew it so I'm not sure how it wore out so quick. I got a thicker cable this time, maybe it won't twist up so much."
4,Wakeman Live in '75,"This is one of the earliest ""Live"" Wakeman recordings currently available. Taped with their usual technical expertise for a King Biscuit Flower Hour radio show, it's also the earliest disc to feature Rick's ""streamlined"" band, The English Rock Ensemble. This 8-piece outfit, which included Ashley Holt (vocals) & Tony Fernandez (drums), would go on to record the bizarre NO EARTHLY CONNECTION just a few months later, as well as LIVE ON THE TEST, the BBC-radio show a month after that. (Sadly, both of those are currently out-of-print-- but at least I got MINE!) This disc is pretty standard for Wakeman-- but that's nothing to knock! It's just that these days there are SO MANY live Wakeman albums to choose from, and good as this is, there's a few others I like even more..."
2,The copyright tangle,"You should read an article about John Clare by John Lanchester in the New Yorker magazine, 27 October 2003 (pages 98-102). All my information comes from that article, which lauds Eric Robinson for decades spent assembling and publishing nine volumes of poems by John Clare, a penniless English peasant who overcame poverty to do his writing, including many poems written while in a British madhouse, where he died. The poems excerpted in the New Yorker are superb. Clare wrote about 3500 poems (Emily Dickinson only 1775). Along with the kudos to Robinson, the author of the New Yorker article criticizes him for buying up, for one pound, the copyright to all Clare's unpublished poems (the majority of them) and denying publication by others. Perhaps that is why this 500-odd page book costs $180."
2,a little disappointed,"This is a guide book, not a book with photos and descriptions as I thought. Although it lists inns throughout Japan, I was hoping to see colored photos of the inns. This little paperback is strictly designed if you are planning a trip to Japan and need some help finding a place to stay. Just the names of the inns, and some information about each one. Aas with most books of this type, they become outdated quickly because prices change, etc."
3,"Not bad, but doesn't match the picture","I purchased this case because according the to picture there was an internal pocket for a Mini SD card. The case I received didn't have that. Other than that, the case works fine, it's just not the case pictured."
4,concise and descriptive,"For those of us raised on the dry (but informative) Kolb and Whishaw standard text, Marie Banich's book is refreshing. The requisite information is conveyed in a manner that is simultaneously concise and descriptive. Her examples, figures and captions are engaging and memorable. This is one of the least verbose and self-indulgent textbooks I have ever read."
2,Baffling,"I received these quickly enough, but they don't come with instructions. It's not obvious to me how to use them -- I've lost one, because I managed to get it to stay on the ring for a while, but it fell off. Where can I get some guidance on how to use this?"
2,Ring Guards,"My Item arrived really fast and in good shape, but once applying the ring guard to my ring , and by the way i made sure i did this right, it slips around and around my ring, instead of staying on the bottom, they slide around to the top, and i keep having to turn my ring back around, it is very annoying, and in my opinion not worth buying....."
2,Resizes ring but,"While the guard does decrease the ring size, the metal it is made of is so soft it is often pulled free by day to day work. In fact, my husband has already lost it off his ring."
1,2 Jumbo Ring Guards Class White Sizer Adjust Jewelry,"Bought these to re-size a college ring that became to big after I lost some weight. I will preface this review with the fact that I have larger knuckles. Therefore, once I put the ring guard on the ring and tried to push it over my knuckle the guard crushed down and was not longer useful. The material these are made of are thin almost tin-like material. It is very soft, so I believe even if you did not have my ""knuckle"" issue, that the first time you grabbed something with the hand the ring was one and exerted pressure on the bottom of the ring, the guard would flatten out. I went through all 3 of them trying different ways to get it to work with no avail. I ended up going with a rubber ring guard instead, which I reviewed in another review. I will say that shipping was good and it arrived in a timely manner."
4,Ring Guards,"I had a ring several sizes to big. These guards kept my ring from falling off mr finger. They bkeep my ring where it belongs, on my finger."
4,Faxing Review,"This book was a tremendous help! Several weeks ago, I was tasked with researching replacement products for our existing desktop faxing package. Being new to the Telephony/faxing field, I was somewhat unfamiliar with the ""faxtalk""...ie faxing terminology, the telephony relationship, protocol, etc. After reading this book, I now have a much better understanding of how faxing actually works.....from dialing to routing. The book also has an overview of each major faxserver product. (This was very helpful, since I was tasked to research several the vendors!)This is by no means a sole technical reference source, but if you are looking for an all-purpose faxing book that explains faxing/faxserver concepts and how faxing works in the enterprise, this is a good one."
3,"Helpful, But Annoying","I found this guide to be extremely helpful. However, I also noticed that the book has many markets that publish only articles and stories from teenagers. In fact, most of the best ones . I think this is very annoying and even more frusterating. If you are in the 8-12 age catigory, I would reccommend trying another book. If you are thirteen or older, this is the book for you."
4,"Interesting read on death.. Open and honest, good work! Eathel!","This author, an Rn working in nursing homes. Ill be the first one to admit thats one of the hardest and most rewarding jobs anyone of us could admire to. This author has the guts to not only work in this envoriment with love and caring which comes across in her writtings, but also she confronts her fears about death and the mostly unspoken things that go on that us in the medical feild see time and again.If you have any questions about death, or the here after, this is a great place to start. Its an aswome place to start your quest on looking into the depths of the paranormal universe..."
3,Making the Most,"Drawing on his wide experience as an evangelist, teacher and evangelism enthusiast, Michael Green's slim book (100 pages) is designed for the beginner. It is ""full of ideas on reaching out to our families, friends and neighbours in a way that is relaxed, `human', and possible even to those who feel unqualified for the job.""The book is easy to read, fast moving (even a little breathless) and offers nuggets of advice. The short chapters each tackle a misconception about evangelism. For example, ""not shouting, but bridge-building"", ""not crisis but process"", ""not clergy dominated but laity owned"".The chapters are brief, and they pack in a lot of wisdom, but the problem with brevity is that there is not space to explore how to do this - to ""get under the skin"" of what gets people going as witnesses, and how - in practice - and in the rough-and-tumble of ordinary life - evangelism makes sense and is possible."
4,"""...a brilliant day all round""","Steve Meyers has got some really awful luck. He is a retired attorney in Australia and he has decided to cash in all his money to live a happy peaceful life upon his boat. Unfortunately his boat is destroyed in a strong thunder storm. He figures, no problem I'll talk to my insurance fella and get this cleared up. If you ever had your insurance claim denied you will relate when he is told that it was an act of God. So he decides to sue God to recoup his losses. To sue God, you sue his trusty earthly servants, the only way that they can win the case is to prove that God doesn't exist? There is a very uncomfortable problem.The movie does not make fun of the church or God. His real beef is with insurnace companies using God as a loophole. It's clever, and witty. Judy Davis is great as Anna, and Billy Connolly is always a good time. Is this the best ever legal movie, no. It doesn't claim to be either, it's fun, watch with a light heart."
5,Good Movie,"I like 'The Big Yin' anyway.I purchased the wrong region DVD for my player, watched it on my computer and then some friends who came from the country region had it as a present.Good movie, funny and could be true.The first 30 minutes aren't really rivetting but after that it is good,Well worth watching."
4,Light Hearted Fun,"This is a light hearted, fun film. I love the idea behind it, as well as some of the arguments used in the film. Billy is excellent as a typically (For him!) opinionated man who tells it like it is. A great film for lazy Sunday afternoons when you want to be entertained and not think too hard! Give it a go.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
2,COPYPROTECTED - too bad -its a good CD,"Another copy protected CD that wont play in my truck - wont play in my CD player in my PC (BTW, that IS my stero system, 5.1 speakers and all...) Too bad - I love the songs and love SheDaisy.. but if you can't listen to it legally... then copy protection isn't the answer.360 of you is awesome.. guess i have to listen to it on the radio."
1,The few reviews speaks for itself,Shedaisy is boring and doesn't sell many cd's. Totally explains the few reviews they have.
1,How?? Why???,"How do these women still have a recording contract? Why? Country fans have done everything right. We don't buy their albums (Knock on the Sky) sold less than 100,000 copies), we don't request their music (not that that affects airplay these days), we don't have anything to do with them when we can avoid it. And yet, they keep turning up. Why? And why do we keep getting afflicted with them on country radio? Better selling, better singing and better writing women get left completely in the dust. Why, if they MUST deprive us of Allison Moorer and Kasey Chambers, can they not, at the very least, refrain from foisting these girls off on us. If they can ban The Dixie Chicks for anti-American statements, can't they ban SheDaisy for a project so blantantly anti-music?"
4,There best CD yet!,"I really liked this CD. I got the exclusive Target version, so I got two extra tracks, but even with out those two extra songs, I liked this one. Thier fist song, ""Passenger Seat"", I think is the best on here. But if you like Country Pop, then you'll love this CD."
3,Ordinary material from a less-than-ordinary group,"The first time I heard Passenger Seat, I was hooked! What a brilliant song and video. I had to wait to even put this on my Amazon.com wish list! Well, finally the day came and here's the scoop:Passenger Seat wins! This is the best song on the CD and has endless replayability. Woman's Work was my next favorite. It deals with a woman on the edge and on the verge. Great lyrics and pleasing melody. 5 4 3 2 Run was my next favorite. A spunky song that's playful. Sadly, the rest of the CD was very ordinary. How could a group that recorded Passenger Seat record the balance of these songs? I'm puzzled by that. This group is very talented, but 80% of the material on the CD doesn't reflect that fact.Bottom line: Since Passenger Seat won't be released as a CD single, invest in this CD. I'm glad I did, but only a few tracks will see the laser on a repeat basis."
2,Here's my actual cancellation email,"""Please cancel my subscription on it's monthly renewal date. I haven't been using IBD because the editorials make the WSJ look like flaming liberals. In other words, Mr. O'Neill is to the right of Gengis Khan. I've been a life-long Republican and many of the editorials [are so past right-wing that they] infuriate me.""[The Editor must own stocks of war merchants. IBD does have good features, if you can look past it's outrageous editorials. I could not... I still subscribe to Barrons and the WSJ, however.]"
3,The Daily Gamblers Guide to the Stock Market,"This is much more appropriate title for IBD. I give three stars because they do have articles that benefit ""investors"" but this publication is more of a gamblers guide with technical analysis that is more akin to dubious betting schemes in Vegas than in market investing. If you get the Wall Street Journal, you don't need IBD. If you get IBD instead of the WSJ, then you are a fool."
2,Will IBD staff support charts NOW with the new Kindle DX??,Dear Investor's Business Daily writing Staff:Will you be able to implement graphs now with the advent of the new Kindle DX coming out on Amazon.Com this summer?Is your Company working hard to actually give us the clients want we need? Charts ETC ETC. Please retain us as customers. BC
3,Excellent financial paper missing best parts,"The Investors Business Daily is an objective, well written, and organized paper. It covers daily general, business, and financial news and has interesting articles on important trends. The Kindle version gives the reader the daily news without any political agendas. There is also a good Issues and Insights column for those who want opinion.The Kindle version does not include the IBD Research tables that are included in the Paper and Internet versions. The Research tables contain the most valuable information that IBD offers to investors and are a major reason for the papers popularity.I rate the paper and internet versions a five star and the Kindle version 3."
5,Super Value !!,"I just began my subscription few weeks ago. IBD is one of the best news and information sources available. With great articles on investing, the economy and the political arena, there's no better place to go to get informed. THE BEST place and VALUE for starting your day."
2,IBD,"I was disappointed by the complete lack of proprietary IBD content (stock charts, IBD 100, etc.)."
2,Needs Charts,Good reading but without the Charts and the stock ratings info. Just not IBD without some of it. Would pay a couple bucks more if it was included.
1,VERY POOR PRODUCT,As mentioned several times before without the graphs and scores in the print edition (WSJ also doesn't provide graphs) this is a waste of money. Content is not indexed as well as on other papers making navigating odd.
1,Cut your loses,"This apps doesn't show stock price or charts. The reason I look into it, is for IBD proven track record for highlighting winning stock. I guess that is not always the case."
3,"Nice, but leaves you wanting more","IBD is a great newspaper for investment ideas, but the Kindle edition leaves too much out. I would gladly pay more if it included everything the paper edition has.IMO $6/month is worth the price for the Kindle edition, but it leaves you wanting more."
3,"Great articles and editorials, not much else","Like other reviewers, the IBD kindle edition has great articles and editorials, but no stock quotes or the like. That said, for $5.99 a month, I have been subscribing for over a year now, and it is worth that price. Like the print version, the articles are slightly dated--their press time is much earlier than the Wall Street Journal. So what you read was probably composed about 6 Eastern time the day before and typically a lot happens up to 11 pm or so. Monday's edition is really dated but so is their print version. Like I said, worth the $5.99 month, but not much more."
2,A pass on future purchases.,This format excluded the charts which is the backbone of this publication. Useless without them. You should with draw until charts included.
2,too much missing,How can you not have charts? That's the point of reading it for me. The articles are great but nothing I couldn't get free online.
1,Don't buy the kindle version,"There are no charts, links to videos (that I can not see on the kindle), not much content in the first place.Compared to financial times kindle version: don't buy it."
1,Too Much Political BS,"If I want to read about the politicians, I'll find other sources. Romney or Obama's position on Jerusalem or Tel Aviv have nothing to do with the current market conditions and after reading three straight biased pieces on the subject this morning alone this is clearly not the type of magazine that sticks to it's subject of Investors and Business."
1,what happened to IBD?,"I stopped reading IBD for a while cause its quite difficult for me to obtain paper copies in my area and frankly I don't have the time to go through a full newspaper every day. But the times that I did, I found the investigative work on the companies and stocks very informative and useful. This was pre-Obama though. What happened IBD? Seriously! I bought one issue of the kindle version to check out and 90% of the content was fashioned in the form of one long Obama hate mail. Whatever happened to the insightful and thorough research anymore? I pick up a copy of INVESTOR'S BUSINESS DAILY to read about businesses and investing and not the bitter rantings of how your authors or most likely your owners hate Obama.Supremely disappointing."
3,Good articles but no charts in the Kindle edition,IBD always has great articles but it's the charts that are critical. No charts will show up on the Kindle. Keep this in mind when subscribing. I would rather buy it one issue at a time.
2,Too much missing in the KINDLE version,"I was hoping to keep my life clutter free by getting the IBD on my kindle rather than in paper. However, its just not useful. Need the graphs as well as all the other missing pieces. I don't even recall seeing the IBD 100 on the Kindle version. Cancelled and went back to paper."
1,Paper is great but content does not read well with the Kindle,"I subscribe to the IBD digital edition and read it most days. I figured that the Kindle would make this process easier. However, I discovered that the linear reading nature of the Kindle heavily clashed with the random reading nature of the IBD. The IBD contains hundreds of one paragraph news blurbs that you can acquire by scanning the newspaper. This does not work well with the Kindle. By contrast, The Wall Street Journal is heavier on in-depth articles and is nicely indexed for the Kindle. Finally, IBD is what it is because of its graphs. It just isn't that good without the pictures.The paper(or its digital edition) is great and has helped me with my investing the last several years."
3,You can get individual issues also,One thing not mentioned in the Amazon page for the Kindle edition of IBD or the other review present at the time of me writing this is that you can get individual issues for $.50 from the Kindle.
2,Very Disappointed,"I had decided that I could live without the charts, etc. in the Kindle version if I could go online and check out the items I needed to. Big problem: they don't give Kindle subscribers access to the Subscribers Only sections of the website. I'm cancelling now."
1,worthless without charts,"Without charts, learning to recognize chart patterns is impossible. without charts, IBD is worthless to an investor."
2,"Love the publication, but it's hard to read on the Kindle","This publication is an awesome investment resource. But, I found it difficult to read on the Kindle. It looks like everything is displaying properly- It may just be that I'm old-fasioned and used to getting the actual paper."
2,ekindle IBD,"Agree, there is too much missing from the kindle version and they make it difficult to find the link to cancel the free subscription."
2,None,IBD should sell single issues for the iPad to make a useable version available at a fair price!!!
2,IBD KINDLE EDITION ONLY GOOD 4 THE ARTICLES,"I find it easier to read IBD articles from my Kindle, but I agree with the many other reviewers here that without the charts, the value of getting an IBD via Kindle is pretty limited from an investor's point of view. The yearly subscription is priced over my head and I can't find it here locally in Cape Coral, Florida.....I would have to drive over 40 miles away to Naples, Fl to find a vendor. If they offered a Friday only subscription, I would subscribe to it....or even a Friday and Monday package........wish one vendor would pick it up in Cape Coral...."
5,Very Helpful,"It's just enough information to get you started, the book is set up so easy and properly. DEF would recommend to anyone who's entering the dental field. I've already learned a good amount and I'm starting a job on monday :) get it !"
4,"Nice gameplay, nice sound, bad controls.",This game is good! it rocks the controls aren't to good but you get used to them fast enough. The graphics are good better than any game boy game i've seen. The sound is good. (you get real music not that drumming from the first one.) It is a keeper! i gave it four stars cause of the controls other than that a really great game!
3,Belkin Sony Keyboard -- almost right,"This fold-out keyboard is almost just right. It is much sturdier than the Targus (which flops around) and the keys have a better depth with the option to turn on/off the ""click"". The placement of the PDA is good, and it can even be charged while it rests securely in place. However, for a touch typist (like myself), the right shift key is way too far over, the enter key does not work in all functions, and the space bar just doesn't work very well at all. In fact, the space bar only works by pressing firmly in the middle portion only, a serious enough defect that my Belkin will be going back. Too bad -- I do think that this is the best of the keyboards out there, just not close enough!"
3,Problem with Taiwanese language,"I bought this for my Taiwanese speaking parents and we just completed a 2 week road trip. It was disappointing that the Taiwanese is a direct translation of Mandarin Chinese, and word for word translations usually come out garbled. Some of the directions in Taiwanese were incomprehensible and in the end, my parents preferred the Mandarin version. However, the Mandarin voice is pleasant, clear, and very understandable. Some other criticisms:1) Turn in 200 ft is actually turn NOW!2) Not enough warning to get off when driving on the freeway unless you remember to look at the screen.3) The GPS doesn't announce the street name. It just says to turn in X distance.4) it's hard for people to read screens if they wear bifocals or are far sighted.Pros:1) Really easy to use out of the box and the touch screen interface is nice.2) Useful when really lost3) Can find gas stations or restaurants close to current or final destination."
2,Just ok,"If you don't know how to find the way home, its really help. But if you want to find some places new, then you may not rely on this GPS. As the map of this model is not new. If you want to get the latest map, you need to buy online for $69.99."
3,"MDK: Murder, Death, Kill Myself","Let me tell you, this game is great in many ways... absolutely stunning graphics, 3 unique characters, a fun premise. So why only three stars? This game is unbelievably, totally, ...-crazily, ludicriously, ridiculously hard. I can't tell you how frustrating it is. I gave up. The enemies are so hard that you think they are bosses, and soon, you actually come to a boss and you just play over and over, and over, and over again...and it never helps. So, I was so mad, I stooped to the lowest level, and no...MDK2 is not supported by Gameshark. So, unless you are a game master over the age of 16, I don't recommend this game."
2,Painfully difficult,"The graphics are smooth and intense. The controls, even though initially confusing, are pretty good. I've gotten pretty far in this game as well (8 out of 10 levels completed) after playing many, many hours on this game.Sound good, right? Wrong! The difficulty of the Dreamcast version is terrible. I had been in the console/computer game business a while back, and one of the main flaws I noticed is that computer game developers are hardcore gamers, developing games for hardcore gamers. This is a classic example. ...Given enough time, many people could pass this game. However, there are limits. After all, it's just a game, and should only take a maximum 100 hours to complete. This is well beyond the 100 hours.Unless you live and breathe video games and you find ninety-nine percent of all games too easy, stick to another game. I cannot stress this enough! It is nearly impossible to complete for any normal person!"
4,Great Graphics! Great Characters! Great Game!,"If you are one of those people who says that dreamcasts graphics look just like any other system, this game changes all that. MDK2 is one of the best games on the Dreamcast. Trust me on this one, if you thought that Jet Force Jemini(N64)wasn't that great, you'll love this game! And amazon charges an excellent price for this game."
2,WARNING RENT IT FIRST!,"When I first put the game in the graphics stopped my breath. After figuring out that the buttons on the right side of thecontroller moved my character around I was [upset]! Here you have a walk-around first person shoot'em up and you have to use the A,B,X,Y to move, very confusing especially when you have the + barely being used in the game (not the analog stick but the other one). The game would have been a lot better if this was different. Sorry I Can't Like a Game When the controller configuration is so different and is not adjustable."
3,Cook book,"The book was in ok condition. Rather smudged and slight tear. It was bought used so somewhat expected. Took longer than some other items I ordered recently, but ok"
5,This is my new favorite cookbook!,"This is a delightful collection of unusual yet easy to prepare recipes. I have many, many cookbooks. This is my new favorite and THE cookbook that I will reach for when company is coming for dinner. For example, the ""Cauliflower Panache"" consists of cauliflower flowerets with a puree of brocolli, has a lovely, unique presentation, and is very, very tasty."
3,Mega-Tech customer,"I liked the product. It didnt give the results of the other Mega Tech conditioner that comes in the blue and black bottle. That one is excellent. This one is good, but for extreme hair growth and condtioning use the one in the blue and black bottle."
1,Mega Tek products,"Although this may be a great product for HORSES, use with caution on DOGS!! Caused a MAJOR skin irritation on my Doberman!!"
4,I will buy more when I run out.,"I bought this for thinning hair, I have noticed that my hair isnt falling out as much. Smell is not that great but it is strong and will last a while. I dont mind it and my husband likes it."
5,Mega Tek Pet Rebuilder,This stuff worked better then I ever imagined. My dogs had hot spots all over and he lost a lot of hair. I literally have tried every shampoo there is out. Within 3 weeks of using this produck my dogs hair had grown back. I even told my vet about this stuff!
5,Super fast shipper!!!,"I was amazed at how fast I received my item, considering we're on opposite coasts. I will definitely shop from this seller again. This was a smooth transaction!"
1,Not one of my brighter ideas!,I feel bad leaving a bad review since this product is being sold for pets but i used on my own hair. I just want people to be aware of my experience before using on them selves. I got severe scalp irritation which was a surprise because i don't have sensative skin. It did smell good though. I used to use this on my dog regularly but im not going to. Product makes me a little nervous now. Hope this helps!
3,Doesn't smell good,So far I see a little difference in my hair growth. I have been using it for two weeks now. First I applied it to my whole scalp but after my four year old son and husband mentioned that my hair didn't smell good. I only applied to the necessary area. Please do something about the fragrance.
1,doesnt work for humans!,"So I bought this product for my hair...depsite the fact its made for animals because i had read countless reviews stating that it did wonders for human hair (made it thicker, stronger, grow back, etc)...however, everytime i used it my hair was left feeling dry, coarse and just yucky. And honestly, it smells good...but it smells like a dog shampoo. i was embarrassed that people might know im using it. I would not recommend this product at all. It is possible my hair was feeling harder because it was coating it and making it ""stronger""...but i didnt like the look or feel of it at all!!!"
2,"Flat, rushed and sketchy","I love Star Wars. I love Star Wars comics. I adore Revenge of the Sith. I was very disappointed. This comic adaptation is an emotionless, bare-bones outline of the plot - not at all what I expected after enjoying Dark Horse's recent runs of suberb, extremely well realized tales. If you want a quick overview, by all means buy this comic. For an adaptation that contains a smidgen of creativity, I recommend picking up Stover's excellent novelization instead."
2,"Good kid's book, but not a graphic novel.","Pretty good kid's book adaptation of the movie. I own (and have read) the adult version of the novel. I purchased this thinking it was a graphic novel, but it isn't, which left me rather disappointed. If you want a good kid's book of the movie, buy this one, but don't be fooled; it isn't a graphic novel."
5,Noor's Review,"REVENGE OF THE SITHBy: Patricia C. WredeBased on the story and screenplay by George LucasTheme: AdventureSetting: In a galaxy far far awayThe jedies are heroes of the galaxy. As in every story there are the heroes and the villains, like the siths. These too powerful forces are at war, but there is only one person that can give balance to the force, his name is Anakin Skywalker. He is a jedi whose feelings are in conflict. Skywalker should not feel love, but he felt it for princess Padme, with whom he is married. Padme got pregnant, which is also prohibited to jedies.Anakin did not want to lose Padme, but one night he dreamed of her dying. That is why he accepted help from the dark side, as a way of saving her. But things got really wrong...Quotes: ""Leaning forward, Anakin caught the count's lightsaber as it fell"".""The anger still sang in his veins"".""Dooku tried to speak, but Anakin's hands were already moving""."
3,Decent entry into the forensic investigator genre,"I wasn't overwhelmed by either the suspense or tension in the story, but this is a decent entry into the forensic investigator genre, and has potential."
3,Book Innocence,This was a very strange story that I don't know really what the ending meant. It left me hanging as to who the guilty party was. It kept my interest however.
3,okay but not into it.,This is the first book I've read of Ms. Novak & was kind of okay but not good or great.
4,Innocence,An enjoyable read. This book took me longer than normal to read. I'm not sure if it was the book or life. I'll read her books again.
4,Great read,I found this book to be well written and enjoyable to read. The story had several twists and turns but the ending fit perfectly. I would recommend this book.
2,A disappointment,"I looked forward to reading this after reading the reviews, but found I did not care for it. For me it was a bit of a jumbled mess of a novel. I did not like the style and was, quite frankly, glad when it ended."
4,Tricky at first but worth a try.,"Although it's a little tricky at first, this helps reach the difficult sections in my back to relieve pain. I use it regularly. Took one star off because it is tricky at first but once you experiment with it, you can use it to relieve pain."
3,Good idea but needs improvements.,The idea is great to get to places you cannot reach but the different size balls you use on the end to push and roll on your body are made of hard wood instead of a softer rubber product. The wooden pointer used to push on trigger points also broke off.
3,Decent but could use a lot of editorial work.,"I am studying for an ASCP certification as an MLT and decided to buy this book even though it seems geared more toward MTs. While there is a lot of usful information there are also very many typos, many of which make the reading very confusing. For example, when the book gives the formula for creatinine clearance it mislables one of the variables. If it wasn't for an MT I'm working with helping me decipher the typos I would be completly lost. So, if you only have a little experiance make sure you have someone to ask about the typos. Otherwise it seems like a decent investment."
5,Clinical Lab,This book has help me tremendously for my class and I haven't opened the CD yet. I'm sure it will be helpful also.
4,classic yet little known,"here is david crosby in great form and fine voice.the very first song,""tracks in the dust"" sets the tone for the whole cd.a little known ""nighttime for the generals"" rocks out.david and the band were one for this performance.note-stipped down versions of this are available under different titles,so remember to specify the KING BISCUIT version."
2,Lasso some Tabasco instead!,"Texas Pete's is the #1 hot sauce in the South - it's ubiquitous in every type of restaurant. If you ask for Tabasco, you're likely to get Texas Pete's hot sauce instead. The company was founded in 1929 in Winston-Salem, North Carolina; their first product was their barbecue sauce, but the hot sauce soon followed. This is a basic hot sauce - peppers, vinegar, and salt - and it can be used as you would Tabasco or a Louisiana hot sauce. Unfortunately, it's extremely mild. I often find that, in order to add the desired heat to food, I have to add so much that the food becomes watery. My scrambled eggs end up a mess and still taste bland. If you like a mild hot sauce, then Texas Pete should be one of your top choices. Otherwise, avoid this wimpy selection.The company's website includes a plethora of recipes using their products - the Chicken Brunswick Stew is a North Carolina tradition."
2,Average Hot Sauce,"Texas Pete is very average. It has too much of a peppery taste and isn't really that hot. In fact, I would describe the overall flavor as bland, not tasty at all. I have tried a lot of hot sauces, and while Texas Pete is not bad, it leaves me a little flat."
3,Good but not as good as others,"I am a huge spicy food fan! I put hot sauce on just about everything and have tried probably a hundred different sauces. While this one is good, I find it a bit boring compared to others. It does add a little kick but the flavor is lacking. There are a lot of sauces that add pure heat but either the heat is overwhelming or the flavor is completely lacking. My number one favorite hot sauce is:Yucatan Sunshine Habanero Pepper Sauce -[..]It's about as spicy but the flavor is fantastic! I put it on Mexican food, pasta, etc. I always have a few bottles of this around and give them away to friends pretty regularly."
1,Horrible,"I've been making and mixing hot sauces with extra pepper ect and tweaking it for awhile now. I normally marinade for hours and make wings almost nightly for the protein.Long story short, I used this sauce and the first thing I noticed was the rancid smell coming from my oven. I kept trying to tell myself it would taste good, I ended up eating as much as I could of a breast and had to throw away the rest and I also threw away the bottle of Texas Pete's. I was absolutely amazed that a hot sauce could taste so bad when cooked, absolutely the worst sauce I've ever had; stick with Franks Red Hot and Anchor Bar and you'll never be disappointed. If you want more heat at cayenne pepper :)"
2,from a Texan's perspective...,"I have to disagree that this is the ""#1 hot sauce in the South"".Maybe certain parts of the south...I have lived my whole life in Texas and had never even heard of ""Texas Pete's"" until I travelled to D.C. (I think it's made in New Hampshire or something)In Texas, sauces like that are referred to as ""Louisiana-sauce"" because it's fairly mild, vinegar-based, and uses the cayenne pepper. In Texas we prefer spicier, more chili-based sauces and instead of the cayenne, we tend to favor the Ancho for flavor, the serrano or even habanero for heat and of course the ubiquitous jalapeno.I had a good laugh when I encountered this stuff.For some good hot sauce, try:ValentinaMelindaYucateca (XXX)Herdezin Houston, we have an enormous Vietnamese population, so Sriracha is also very common, even at Mexican Restaurants. We call it ""Ketchup"""
2,An emphatic NO!,"Texas Pete is the worst. First of all, its made in Winston-Salem North Carolina and served in all the diners here in the Carolinas like ketchup, which it complements very well, but doesn't add any heat too.Rates out at about 500 Scoville units, Texas Pete can only be described as ""hot sauce flavored thinned-out tomato sauce."" Don't go out of your way to find this stuff, it ain't worth it."
3,A satisfying hot sauce,"For well over a year, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food. Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches. Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Texas Pete Original Hot Sauce has set itself apart from the others. I like having this hot sauce around as a basic staple. It is not too mild and not too hot and has a satisfying flavor. This is a hot sauce that I can use on different types of food. It is a recommendable hot sauce."
5,A tame and delicious hot sauce!,"Texas Pete is a milder hot sauce that is served in so many restaurants in the South because it is pleasing to most palates. Its not meant to blow the roof off, but instead to give a nice peppery flavor to your food. It also isnt based on the favored peppers of Texas; the Garner brothers of North Carolina just wanted a name to suggest the spicy southwest flavor. The year was 1929, so chillax. Its worth a taste, regardless of what detractors are saying here. Please try it and decide for yourself. I personally love it and add it to darn near everything!"
1,Misjudgement of a Puerto Rican Family.,"This book was very well written, but realistically the people that don't really know about the history and culture of PuertoRicans will have a misunderstanding of what a real PuertoRican family is. We have values and morals and we would never accept things such as a child of ours masturbating in front of us. If you want to read this book, go ahead but don't judge all PuertoRicans by this book or what's reflected in this book. When Mr. Lewis wrote this book back in 1960's I was a high school student and I never witnessed or heard of things like that. I don't understand why this family was chosen to represent the greater PuertoRican population."
2,Not really about technical intelligence,"The title of this book is somewhat misleading. It is a concise and relatively informative discussion of technology strategy and tactics, rather than technical intelligence. It does contain a good overview of the different sources of technical intelligence, but very little useful material on intelligence analysis. A number of case briefs of are included, but they are weakened by the author's choice not to include company identities in the briefs."
4,Looking beyond the factory fence,"Mr. Coburn may cause you to challenge the approach that you take in understanding your business. He forces you to look from the outside inward rather than looking outward which is generally the path of least resistance. Surprise your customers and competitors are also living in this space. We will begin to see things differently from this vantage point, and that is a key part of the message in this book. Our ability to utilize the knowledge that exists in this competitive world will facilitate the improvements inside of our business. The advantage for the winners in the future will be to capture this mass of data, transform it into knowledge and/or wisdom and move this activity into one of your routine business process. Not such an easy task to create in a cost cutting world, but you can't afford ""not to."""
3,"Good Idea, Needed to Replace Batteries Right Away","This toy is a good idea especially for the smaller kids, but I had to replace the batteries as soon as I tore off the packaging because the car kept revving its engine every time I moved it. So needless to say, the kids knew that they were getting cars before they ever opened them. Otherwise, I loved it and so did the kids."

2,Godzilla Vs. Hedorah,"This DVD is a wide screen version. This movie is a very strong evolution based Godzilla movie. To learn about Hedorah and how it evolved into a pollution monster,pollution was placed into a clear testing dish. Pollution in the form of tadpoles join together by themselves and then by the spark of electricity brings about lifeitself. Such is the formation of Hedorah the pollution monster. You will have to watch the movie on how this evolved pollution monster is destroyed.I personally believe life came about a different way, but this is only a movie."
5,THE BEST GODZILLA MOVIE,I HAVE SEEN GODZILLA VS HEDORAH AKA GODZILLA VS THE SMOG MONSTER MANY TIMES AND I THINK THAT I WAS AWESOME.
1,Pants!,"A meteor from space containing primordial soup from which life springs lands in polluted water and spawns a sludge-monster.The original creator of Godzilla was in hospital while this film was being made and was less than impressed by what he saw on his release. Despite the fact that the Smog Monster is the first metaphorical creature since the creation of Godzilla, the film is pitched at kiddie level. There are extended scenes of pop concerts, some very silly cartoon sequences and a lengthy and wearisome climax. It's not at all helped by a feeble soundtrack which is constantly at odds with what's on-screen. And the Smog Monster (Hedorah) itself is one of the most unintentially hilarious film creatures I've seen for a long while - a blob of marzipan with eyes!Better than Megalon or Gigan, but basically this film is just boring tripe. It's been made without care or interest and it shows."
1,You will not believe Godzilla can fly!,"I generally like Japanese giant monster movies--even if they're a bit on the corny side--but this is the worst Godzilla movie I've ever seen. Basically, Godzilla and Hedora wrestle around for about half the movie--funny at first but boring after a while.Flying Godzilla is pretty corny--kids might like it!All in all-- a boring waste--not very funny, not very dramatic, and not much science in the fiction. This movie would probably be better if it had about half an hour edited out of it--though it's only about 85 minutes long anyway--it's just too monotonous to maintain interest!"
2,VHS not working properly,The VHS tape does not work properly. It will play normally for 30 seconds then vertically skip for 30 seconds throughout entire film. Tracking does not fix the problem.
1,smog,"this is my favorite of all the godzilla movies, it always has been. i remember seeing it at the drive in theater back in the 70s. it's way too much fun. i give it 1 star because when i read one of the other reviews that gave it one star i thought 'wow that guy hates the movie for all the reasons i like it', therefore i think one star is actually a very high compliment in this genre of movies."
3,"Godzilla vs. Hedorah, The Smog Monster","...Under the direction of Yoshimitsu Banno; the effects of Teruyoshi Nakano; and music of Riichiro Manabe, ""Godzilla vs. Smog Monster"" turns out to be a perfectly decent Godzilla movie. This troika really played with the Godzilla movie format; inserting Brady-Bunch style multiple screens and a very new age, anti-pollution theme. I still see a little of the childish slant creeping into the film from ""Godzilla's Revenge"". But the film turns serious quickly enough and is respectably adult-oriented the rest of the way. Godzilla, really emerges as a hero in this film, actively seeking out the threat to earth and annihilating it. All in all, a nice bounce back from the abysmal effort in ""Godzilla's Revenge""."
3,Bizzare film,"If you ask me,this is probably the most bizzare of the Godzilla films.I like to call this one ""HippieZilla"" because of the save the earth message.Add to that,Hedora(aka the Smog Monster)is different than most.The effects are different however,and is also watchable at most"
4,Godzilla vs Smog Monster! (Hedorah),"This movie is so fun and trippy that I can't imagine anyone not liking this movie! It's not just for kids! It's for adults, enviromentalists, marijuana smokers, and monster-movie buffs! The battle sequences aren't quite as good as some of the others, but the movie as a whole is so entertaining and trippy, that you have to see it to believe it! Oh, and Godzilla flies."
4,godzilla goes over my heodra(a.k.a. smog monster),"One of godzilla's best films with the style of the 60's but made in 1971.If u see the scene were godzilla ripes the monsters eyes out,godzilla does it with a grin on his face.Its worth a look.Try it."
2,"Kind of poorly done, with badly dubbed dialogue","Pollution spawns a monster with incredible powers and that consumelys smoke and kills anyone who it flys over. Godzilla, naturally comes to mankind's rescue and the battle begins."
3,Number one of the Godzilla movies,I've always thought this was the best of the Godzilla movies. At least as long as you fast forward past the songs.Basicaly it's Godzilla vers the Smog monster created by man's destruction of the enviroment via chemicals and smog.Love the way the Smog monster keeps changing (tadpole to two legged monster to flying monster)and Godzilla's contempt for man's stupity. This movie is one of the sharpest I've seen even on DVD's. Most DVD's are sharp(clearer) than VHS but this nears HD quality.
4,A pretty good G movie.,"This is a good Godzilla movie.Although the plot is weird I still think its pretty good.This movie was defintely made for younger G fans,like myself."
3,This 1971 movie was pretty good.,"Having seen this movie about four times, the way Godzilla faces his strangest foe has me wondering how he can defend the planet Earth against something that mutates in more ways than a snake shedding its skin, but Godzilla eventually finds a way to defeat Hedorah (the Smog Monster's name) and once he does, the Earth can thank Godzilla for decisively beating the smog monster, although he had some trouble at first."
2,Not the same old Smog Monster we grew up with.,"If you grew up with the Godzilla series throughout the 60s and early 70s then you will not completely recognize this version of ""Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster."" While not one of his greatest outings most Godzilla films released before ""Godzilla on Monster Island,"" a.k.a. ""Godzilla vs. Gigan,"" were dubbed in the United States, mostly by American International. From Gigan on the films were the International dubbings created by Toho and using extremely poor voice actors as well as silly dialogue (as if the dialogue in a Godzilla film could get any worse). Fans of the Orian Video version of ""Smog Monster,"" which played on American TV for years, will be disappointed in the poor quality of the voice actors. While this may not be a major issue for fans post 1980, older fans will sorely miss the ""original"" feel of this film."
2,Wasted a good idea.,"Some effective scenes, and the idea of an embodyment of pollution is a great idea, though it's entirely wasted. The mutating Herodah is not one of Godzilla's feeblest enemies by a long shot, but what really lets this film down is dire special effects, plot padding, silly cartoon sequences and two almost identical final showdowns, one after the other."
2,LOL godzilla flick,Actually this movie is very rare and its OOP i can see whybecause this G flick is very horriable.For one where in helldid the director go with this story and who wrote this?Itsabout some pollution monster name hedorah that pollutes the earthand godzilla fights it to protect the earth.The only good thingabout this movie is the end monster action because it seemsin my point of view hedorah was actually beating up godzillanot until the humans intefering with their project they wereusing to defeat it.But over all i give this a two star becausethis monster G flick was pretty bad but if you havent watch itgo ahead and watch and you may like it better then me.Im a hugeG fan and i was really disappointed in the movie as well thedirector and producers.
4,Stuck Mojo-Declaration of a Headhunter,"What can you say about a band who has been more true to their fans than Stuck Mojo? Their newest CD Declaration of a Headhunter has the same intensity level as their previous albums ie. ""Rising"" and ""Pigwalk"". Stuck Mojo's albums are so consistently good and every album has something different that keeps you hanging on to every lyric. the first track ""Hatebreed"" hits you like a freight train with steel grinding power rhythms. ""Drawing Blood"" contains Death metal scorching vocals which breaks into melodic lyrics filled with emotion, a truly awesome combination. A must have for true fans of Heavy metal, 4 stars."
4,"The best mojo yet, but not enough Bonz!","I have to say that musically, this is Stuck Mojo's best album to date. The addition of keyboards and samples add more depth to the songs. While still keeping their hard edge, the band explores a larger dynamic range. There's even an awesome instrumental called The Ward is my Sheppard. Dan's voice compliments the songs perfectly! Bud's drumming is more adventurous and better than ever. My only criticism of this album is that Bonz's awesome raps seem to have been pushed into the background. In fact, Rich wrote the lyrics for this album even though Bonz wrote all of the lyrics for the past 3 albums. If you want to hear Bonz's sweet rap stylings I would suggest you buy Rising before you get this album. If you want to learn more about the band check out my new Stuck Mojo message board. It has a free mp3 of Hate Breed as well as links to the best Mojo sites on the web!"
4,Better Recording + More money = WAY better record!,"Wow! I was always a Stuck Mojo fan since the ""Rising,"" but this album blows all the others out of the water. They obviously spent more money and put more time on this album. And the best part is that Bonz is actually singing--and he sings REALLY good! A must-buy for any Mojo fans or metal fans alike."
2,For Keith Moon fans only,"As a great fan of the WHO, especially Keith Moon , I had to buy this CD. As most of us know, Moon was neither a songwriter nor a very good singer. During a break in recording a new WHO album and touring, Keith went to the studio to record this album with his ""chums"". I don't think that Moon felt this would be an album of any merit. Just having a good time and jamming with friends was the real intention. The recording is average at best and most of the songs are not memorable. The most disappointing fact was that Moon DID NOT perform most of the drumming on the album. I don't think most fans would buy this CD just to hear him sing! Keith's drum solo on ""The Kids are Alright"" is probably the highlight of the album! Neither the songs nor the singing will attract you to this CD. It is purely for Keith Moon fans who will buy anything with some Keith Moon drumming while waiting for a new live WHO release!"
5,Stunning!!!,"This album is a stunning masterwork. From Keiths flawless take on The Beach Boys' ""Don't Worry Baby"", to his heartbreaking rendition of The Beatles' ""In My Life"", this album hits nary a downpoint from start to finish. What strikes me the most about this album is Keiths determination in his singing. And the sheer professionalism of the backing musicians lend this album a very subtle, quiet, relaxed feel. You can tell these guys were serious about making a very good album. And they succeeded. This album is highly underrated, and deserves to be re-evaluated by all."
4,"It's Keith, All The Way!","A big fan of The Who, always thought that Keith was one of the best drummers ever, and his crazy antics always entertained us. This solo album is, short & sweet, Keith having fun while making some music with friends, including the likes of Ringo Starr, Harry Nilsson, Joe Walsh, Rick Nelson & Jim Keltner. Is the album perfect? Heck, no; but it's fun to listen to and I find myself playing it more than a few times every year. R.I.P., Keith - Gone but NEVER forgotten."
2,And now for a collage of crap...,"This is a reissue of Keith Moon's only solo album. It is a bit of a disappointment. Keith was known as the best drummer in rock, and he barely plays the drums on any of the songs here. This album is more along the lines of ""Keith sings some songs, with the help from some of his buddies"". It definitely sounds like Keith had a lot of fun making this album, but the listener may not share in the fun. There was a reason that Keith rarely sang on Who records, other than the occasional ""joke"" song. The CD adds several bonus tracks, including a radio spot, alternate takes and songs from Keith's unfinished second album. Some fans of the Who may enjoy this album, but I expect that most people won't like it."
1,For die-hards and completists only...,"This is a remastered reissue of Moon's one and only solo album with 8 bonus tracks. Helping Moon out is a who's who of rock...Ringo, Flo & Eddie, Bowie, Nilsson, Joe Walsh, Ronnie Wood, Ricky Nelson, Steve Cropper, John Sebastan, Dick Dale, Spencer Davis, Jim Keltner, Bobby Keys, Klauss Vorman and various members of Jo Jo Gunne. So how could this suck so bad? Two reasons...1) Keith Moon sings 2) Keith Moon plays drums on only one song (Kids Are Alright). This is for die-hards and completists only."
1,~Gack!~,"This is one of the very worst albums I've ever had the extreme displeasure of hearing. It's just horrible. This despite the fact that Moon was, with The Who, anyway, one of rock's greatest drummers. Of course, there's zero indication of that on his solo album. Go figure. Moon did enlist an all star cast to assist, but apparently they were way too wasted to make any difference. There is one acceptable track, 'One Night Stand', which was a cover of one of Rick Nelson's finest '70's singles. Nelson himself is more discernible vocally than Moon, so that explains it's relative quality, I suppose. Skip this disc unless you are either a Who fanatic or a Nelson completist. Even Ringo Starr's presence amounts to nothing, which should tell you something about this abomination."
2,Slow Stuff,Slow to develop characters. A lot of verbage used that did not develop either the characters or the plot
4,Georgia O'Keefe at Lake George,"Spectacular fall foliage and the beauty of the Queen of American lakes (Lake George) serve as the back-drop for an entertaining murder mystery involving the theft of previously unknown paintings by Georgia O'Keefe. O'Keefe fans in particular will enjoy the historical background that leads to the ""discovery"" of lost art. A great beach book."
2,Superficial and Silly,"The characters in this book are stock, cardboard types. The heroine seems to have stepped out of the pages of a 1950's romance mystery written for not especially literate teenagers. The villains are cartoon characters. The vocabulary isn't much above the level of a sixth grade reader and much of the action is implausible. The best thing about the book is the gorgeous cover. I'm surprised the book found a publisher. It is definitely not for the thinking person and I will not purchase another book by this author."
2,Chip Fix,"This product works better on a flat surface. If chips are on the sides of the sink, the product runs and doesn't coat very well. I had to go over spots several times. When the product dried, it was very obvious where the chips had been since there was a product buildup. The sink looks okay from a distance, but eventually I'll need to replace it as this seems to be a temporary fix and is unsightly."
4,Works like it should,The product worked great. I used it to fix the are around the drain in my fiberglass tub. I had to add some epoxy that was gray in color so this stuff covered the mess up perfect.
4,Nice enough,"This is not the highest quality precision instrument I ever saw, but then I didn't pay for one either. This is a very nice horn that will do its intended job well for not much money and likely stay together doing it. It's plenty loud, packaged nicely and makes a nice gift. It's alright."
4,Vacu Vin Wine Saver,This is a great way to save wine up to a week after the bottle has been opened. It's easy to use and makes a click to let you know it's got all the air out of the bottle.
5,Wine Saver really Saves,"This is great for all wines, especially white and sparkling, which you need to cork and put in the fridge rite away. Very easy to use and store, I plan on buying more of the stoppers, so I can have more wine open at a time. The plastic pour tops look a little cheap, but work surprisingly well. It may not look as cute as other wine stoppers, but it works the best. Really keeps the wine tasting better longer."
4,Perfect Gift for the Wine Connoisseur,"I purchased this gift as a ""Secret Santa"" gift to take to a Christmas party and it was a hit. Perfect gift for the wine connoisseur in your life. Works great and pieces are well made!"
3,Better than nothing,"I've used this on a few bottles of wine. It does help extend the life of a bottle, but significantly longer than a simple cork. It does depend a lot on the particular bottle of wine you are trying to seal, and how much it has already been exposed to air, and where it was in it's aging process before opening.Summary: It's worth using, but it's not a miracle worker."
4,Works well,"We bought this to ""upgrade"" from the plastic one we had. It is easy to use and seals the bottle very tight. A tip - before using the ""cork"" wet it slightly and you will get a much better seal. Unless you plan to empty every bottle you open, you need one of these."
4,Like it,"I got the SS version of this in a 443 promo after seeing so many positive reviews on the economy model. We always have a bottle of red and white in the fridge to have a glass at dinner time and this keeps the wine in an as just opened state. The Stainless Steel is just a thin aesthetic piece over the plastic body - I don't think it is more durable than the all plastic version but it does look nice.Knocking off a star because when your bottle is at half or below it can be quite a workout. It's not hard - you just have to pump the thing about a hundred times.Overall, we're happy. Hope to get many years of use out of it, but it is a lightweight plastic mechanism . . ."
5,works easy and reliably.,"bought this a few months ago and everything seems to be durable, it is not complex but it is nice when something that is simple remains simple."
2,disappointed,It wasn't steel and only came with one non drip wine pour.... Instead it was black plastic and came with a cheap plastic wine opener
3,"Decent, but not great","Other vacuum systems I've tried in the past delivered a pretty substantial vacuum in the bottle, this one feels like it removes excess air but doesn't actually apply any vacuum to the bottles. We've more or less quit using ours since it'll start clicking after 6-10 pumps and I don't feel like the job is quite done yet."
2,Wine Preserver,This does not work the way it should. I have tried others I like a lot more. I got rid of this.
5,Makes a great vacuum!,"I will say that I have never needed to save wine after the bottle is opened. I mean come on, you open it you finish it. But when the bottles are empty, I can still put a great vacuum on these empty bottles. I then take them out back and I yell ""Pull!!!"" where by my friend throws the bottle up as high as he can at which put I take aim with my trusty Punt Gun (aim not required ;) and BAM! That mofo shatters all over the place with a resiliant popping sound made when the vacuum is breached. I even got a couple of uses out of each reusable cap since none of the Punt Gun shot hit the cap. Great product! Highly recommended!"
4,Useful Tool,"I find this to be very useful, I use it on a near daily basis. I have kept wine for days, but, the length of time you can hang onto a half full bottle is specific to the wine. I believe this works better than the silver metal with o-rings stopper I used prior to receiving this. I liked it so much I bought one as a gift for a friend."
2,Deosn't Work,"I was really excited about this product, but the pressure stoppers don't seem to work. We've tried everything but none the less, we're back to trying to finish the bottle / using the original corks."
5,works great!,"This thing is so easy to use! You just put on one of the special stoppers that come with the set, put the vacuum over the stopper, and start pumping. It doesn't take very long to get it sealed, and it starts clicking so that you know you're done. The pourers that come with it are handy too."
4,Does what it says,"Product does what it claims, that is, the tool allows you to suck the air out of the bottle which, I'm told, makes the wine last a lot longer. My only complaint: Wish it wasn't so much work. Maybe someone should invent an electric one. If you buy this, consider getting a few extra stoppers."
4,Product looks good - BUT,"Good News/Other News/DisappointmentGood News:[...]Quick delivery-thanks AmazonOther News:White set sells for $9.95Crystal pourers (sold separately) are $4.95Stainless set (including pourers) is $29.95Disappointment. Pourers in the Stainless set are plastic.Appears to work OK. I didn't hear the click, however Ididn't have my hearing aids on."
4,Useful to preserve wine for a little longer...,"Well made product. The finish on the pump is elegant and does not look cheap. Just remind that this won't save your wine of the effects of oxidation but it will give you some extra time before the wine becomes undrinkable.As advertised, when using the pump the ""click"" will let you know there is no more air to extract, usually I let it click for 2 or 3 times. Remember to store the wine in a cool environment after using it. I would not advise to use the fridge for red wines but a fresh and dark place.I would also suggest not to store the wine for more than three days... after this you can perceive some real degradation in taste.I have not used the crystal-like pourers yet, but they look nice."
5,Great product!,"Despite being so small, this is one of my oenophile husband's favorite items.It works wonders for his bottles and even keeps bottles of open champagne/prosecco fizzy a day later.I've bought several as gifts as well, and received positive feedback.Finally, the stainless steel look is definitely a plus."
3,vacu vin,"the product works as promised on bottles that are 1/2 full or m,ore. doesn't seem to do as well when bottle is less than 1/2 full"
5,Great gift set for the wine lover,Bought this for my husband and he really loves it and puts it to good use. The quality of the product was excellent and we are enjoying using it.
4,Still new...,"I haven't used it too much, but it seems to be living up to expectations. The wines definitely taste fresher then with just a cork or screw top."
4,bonne introduction,"Ce livre est une bonne introduction à la théorie des naeuds: panorama impressionnant, il donne envie d'en savoir d'avantage. Je lui enlève une étoile car un certain nombre de dessin sont incompréhensibles."
4,"Great Info, But a bit scattered.","Some very interesting stuff, Very informative about the operational aspects of the airline. However, not a whole lot of information or much detail of the aircraft in the it's fleet past and present. But there is a full list of A/C types and thier Reg #'s. Overall pretty good."
1,Book of air,"For background, I have significant experience in the airline industry, but have never worked for Delta.While the author has clearly talked to many people involved with Delta's history, he has done little more than catalog the bitter sentiments of former employees. His criticisms of the management team would have a lot more credibility if they were accompanied by something resembling a practical alternative. For example, while he seems to agree that costs were out of line in the early 90s, he blasts the layoffs as an assault on the Delta Family. How would he have reduced costs without layoffs? The fact is, nearly every legacy airline in North America has gone bankrupt at least once. Running one requires making a lot of tough decisions in the face of criticism from many people that don't know what they're talking about.This book appears to be nothing more than a large piece of marketing material for his consulting business. If there were more substance included it might be more effective."
4,Great Book for all Delta Fans!!!,"This book contains great information about Delta's history, fleet, maintanance, and the Delta Shuttle, Delta Express, and Delta Connection. It also has a listing of every plane in Delta's current fleet. The only downside is the book is 96 pages."
5,"Hedges, et al (1989)","Excellent step-by-step guide for conducting a meta-analysis. It is definitely ""practical"" as indicated in the title. After understanding the theoretical framework of conducting a meta-analysis, this book is great for procedural guidance."
3,How you play the game,"If you want to journey in the business field or want a view of it than this is the book. It takes you on a journey with a man who started off with nothing and now is one of the most wealthest men in the US. This Book Captures Every Prospect and angle of running your own business, it provides the basic knowledge and understanding of learning how to become a good entrepenuer. Jerry Colangelo is a brilliant individual who has not only changed the view of sports with his amazing inovations but also his efforts on creating a more enjoyable sports industry."
1,Don't waste your money,My high expectations for this book were unfounded. 200+ pages of Jerry C. telling us how wonderful he is in a generally boring and uninformative life story format.
2,"""The master mechanic""walks among us.",Colangelo's explanation as to how he couldn't have been involved in the decision to tax the entire state for his private arena reminds one of another Chicagoan of Italian descent who was vacationing in Florida one winter at the time of the ST. Valentine's day massacre.
3,Sports,"The book How You Play The Game by Jerry Colangelo, is a boring book that is really not that interesting. It is pretty boring. Economics books is really not for me. This book is actually better than the ones I have read. Jerry tells us basically about his life. How he became a multi-millionair from being poor. I would recomend this book to any one that is interested in sports."
4,Matt Goldenberg,"The book was a pleasure to read, I really enjoyed it. It taught me a lot about the real world. There were many ideals and morals that we share. I think some of the things that he says I will one day put to use in the business world. All of his stories were enlightening and entertaining. I would recomend this book to everyone."
4,The True Game,"I truly enjoyed this work by Colangelo and fell many more people should take part in it. Colangelo's story is one of ""rags to riches"" and besides from providing the reader with insightful tips in the business world, his life story alone is interesting enough to read about."
3,how you play the game,I recommend this book for people who want motivation to do better in life.jerry calangello shares his road to the to.because of his desire and dedication he was able to go from working at a rental shop to becoming a multi millionaire businesman.
3,How you Play the Game,this book was good i would recamend this book to anyone how would enjoy a good read. Jerry Colangelo tells you how to have success in the business world. i am thinking about telling my brother to read it it is that good. he also tells you about the odds and ends to working in teh business world but it looks like he did a goo job sofar.but last but not least this was a goo book and i hope you would read it .
5,Rescued Masterpiece,"L'Argent is one of the little known silent masterpieces that have been rediscovered in recent years. The film is distinguished for many reasons. The acting is magnificent led by Pierre Alcover and Birgitte Helm (of Metropolis fame). The costuming and staging are fantastic, in fact the film makers made use of the Paris Bourse for several scenes. Most wonderful is the camera work, which although adanced for the day, even experimental, is completely natural to the story. L'Argent was at the time the most expensive French film to date, designed to compete with both Hollywood and UFA of Germany. David Shepard has written enthusiatically of the French edition of the DVD. A must buy for film buffs and silent film buffs of all kinds"
4,Great present for last Christmas,Gave it as Christmas present to both of my daughters: 8 & 2 years old. They love to play with the little dog.
3,Mead-Freeman Debate,"This is yet another rehasing of Freemans ""Margaret Mead and Samoa: The Making and Unmaking of an Anthropological Myth"". If you have read the first version I would not bother to read this one."
5,What kinda guy?...The kind that delivers!,"This live CD neatly encapsulates the first half of Steve Forbert's impressive career.Recorded in 1982 it finds a young,fun loving, and enthusiastic Forbert leading a road tested band through the best of his original songs to date ,as well as some well chosen covers.The emphasis here is on the fun side of Steve Forbert.The more sobering and reflective type of songs he would record in the late 80's and the 90's were left behind at the bar on this night. Highlights? Hey there all hot here, but, ""Ya Ya"",""Midsummer.."", a particularly lovely version of ""Katrina"", and the Forbert signature tune ""It Isn't Going To Be That Way""' will please even the most discriminating Forbert fan and impress upon newcomers to the music of this great underrated talent just how much they've been missing. Hey, he's still out there working hard you know. Treat yourself to the music of Steve Forbert and give yourself a well deserved smile."
2,poor tape,"this tape basically tried to teach you some relaxing techniques.its not the right tape to make you sleep.the sleep deeply is not the right title.if you have been taking sleeling pills, this tape won't help,don't be fooled and waste your money."
5,Sleeping Like A Baby!,"I had forgotten what that phrase meant until I started using this CD. I have an extremely stressful job and a disabled husband, so needless to say I find it difficult to turn my head off and relax when my very long day finally comes to an end. I have tried meditation, breathing techniques, yoga, over the counter medicines and perscription drugs to acheive the ever-elussive ""good -night's-sleep"" - all to no avail. I felt like I was throwing my money down a hole, and was begining to think that I was doomed to spend the rest of my life in a state of chronic physical exhaustion and mental fatigue. I have found my salvation in this little disc. Ms. Decker's voice is so soothing and yet firm enough to command consentration. The first time I used it, I felt the days stress just melt off of me and the next thing I knew it was morning! I am thrilled to report that I am sleeping better than I have in years!A Reader In Palm Desert"
5,So far so Good,I listened to the CD and was wide awake during the playing of the CD and then after I turned the CD off and put my head on my pillow I was sound asleep and woke up feeling refreshed. I've had sleeping problems for over a year now and I use Ambien and the CPAP machine to help me sleep but this tape really helped me to wake up feeling refreshed. I'm glad I bought it.
5,"By FAR, the best product I've ever used","I have tried a dozen different programs to help with my sleep issues and this is BY FAR the best hypnosis program I have ever used. Janet's voice is soothing and her autosuggestions are very effective. Since starting this program I have regained restful, rejuvenating sleep and I feel great. It has helped me in all facets of my life and I will continue using it as a relaxation CD. I encourage anyone who has problems sleeping to buy this product immediately!"
4,It's a wonderful life!,"I have had the pleasure of dealing with Roger Owens in business in the past and of experiencing him in action at Dodger Stadium. The world would be a better place with more Rogers in it.What a dedicated man he is and he sincerely enjoys the pleasure of others. Thank you, Roger for your sunny outlook and I hope to see you pitchin' for many years to come.Damian"
3,Soft core euro porn,"The video quality was acceptable considering when it was made. Descent plot for this genre. On a 5-point scale: 2 pts. for acting, 2.5 for plot, and 3 for nudity. And the women are NOT as hot as the one on the box art. Got my moneys worth."
3,Frauleins In Uniform,"After reading some of the reviews for this DVD, I decided to buy it, but was rather disappointed in the movie after viewing it. I guess part of the problem was not hearing the actual dialogue, as some things get lost in the translation. Another thing was it did not seem realistic to me as I wouldn't think there would have been that much nudity, and open sexual encounters back in the old days. However there was viewing excellence in the beautiful women, that really did not seem to care if they were wearing clothes or not."
2,Don't Bother,The film to me was a waste of time! It did not seem worth the time to watch nor worth the money.
3,WW2 Euro Sex Comedy,Movie with some FUN to it even if it is in a Bad Situation for the country that is its subject.
1,Dumb movie. Don't download,"I hated this. I ""watched"" this when I was into porn. But the film didn't deliver--go figure! This is almost a propaganda film about the nazi's. Maybe that's your thing. If so, enjoy. Otherwise don't waste your time."
1,Frauleins in Uniform DVD will not play in DVD players,The DVD wom't play. I tried it in 3 different dvd players. When it does try and play it locks up the machine and I have to turn it off and then back on. I am very disappointed in this transaction.
4,Fun flick for saturday night,"I'll go along with Anthony's 4-star review, with these additions:Video quality is very good, crisp and clear. No burnt out highlights, no blocked shadows. This is not a cheap burn. Sound quality is decent, easy to understand.What surprised me about this film was the accuracy of the details. The Russian equipment was the genuine stuff, not repainted US Army surplus tanks and such. Real T-34s, PPsh submachineguns, etcetera. Same with the German equipment- MG 42s and 38s, MP 40s, antiarcraft guns- all real. Pity we didn't get to see any German armor. I would have loved to see a working MKIV, V or VI...Anyway, this movie is well worth buying.All of those beautiful woman in full-frontal nudity are just a bonus.And it is funny in many places."
1,Quality control?,"Did not expect much. T&A flic. Pretty girls overacting. Typical for such. Production and quality of original film quite good. DVD virtually unwatchable. I've not a high end player, but it would be nice if the video would play better than broadcast TV in a hailstorm. I don't leave reviews typically, but this product deserved some criticism."
2,Adhesive does not work... for long,"I purchased this item for my office, and within a week the adhesive would not stay sticky enough to hold it on. It says you can put 150 pages on this holder, but it fell off after less than a week with <10 pages (i.e. the weight of the holder itself is too much for the adhesive included). I am going to try to rig this so it can stay up with other adhesive tape, but I am unhappy that the product didn't last a week as it is designed -- stuck to my monitor!"
1,DISAPPOINTED,This product is awful. The copyholder and the slider do not stay in place on the monitor. I would not recommend this product.
2,Not as pictured,"The nesting dolls I received after ordering this item were similar, but had one major difference. The smallest of the 8 nesting dolls was painted entirely yellow with just a black outlined face. It doesn't match the rest at all. At around $50 with s&h they really shouldn't have skimped on this detail. It really cheapens the set. On a minor note, the other 7 nesting dolls also had less detail than pictured but was acceptable to me at the price. I ended up discarding the 8th (smallest) doll and keeping this item as a set of 7 reasonably detailed nesting dolls."
3,NOT THE PICTURED ITEM,If you are looking for the HOT N Spicy that came in the green bag as pictures...this isn't it. They changed the formula but kept the same name. My husband likes the new stuff but it is more cajuny spices than before. Good luck!!
2,not as good as the frist,I think that this game was not as good as Army Man Sarge's Heros. Personally I think the frist had better characters and levels.
4,video games from amazon,"the games are ok but the company sucks, they use bait and switch advertising tactics and don't recommend anyone doing business with amazon, companies with beter ethics are available on the web."
1,boring,boring graphics sucks my son enjoys it though for about 5 minutes but not worth buying invest in something newer
4,Army Men's Plastic Men,I like this game because this was the first game that taught me how shoot bad guys and not get feared by games similar to gun fighting like Mission:Impossible or something. It taught me how to strafe and better at gun shooting games. That is why I like Golden Eye 007. The guns are cool and stuff but I wish it could be more REAL. Cartoon violence doesn't really have the potential like Golden Eye 007. But I like it anyways. I also like the courses and how they design it. Even the objectives are funny!
3,Easy But Fun,"Sarge's Heros 2 is fun to play and the levels are exciting but there isn't enough of a challenge in this agme to last. There are new battlefields like a pinball table and in a toystore which is the main appeal of the game. There is a 4 player mode which adds a bit more appeal, but i still fell that no game can beat the multiplayer on Goldeneye. To sum this game up, if you can get it cheap its worth buying as yopu wont feel that you have wasted loads of money when you complete it easy."
4,Fun game,"An altruism is that sequels are usually second rate. Fortunately, this isn't true with this game. First of all, the cartridge is green (as in Army men green) which always adds a little something out of the ordinary much like the gold Zelda carts. The game play is relatively easy once you get used to the controls. The graphics are pretty good though not up to the standards of other games such as Super Mario or Pilot Wings but certainly not bad. The sound is very good. Finally, the game is just plain fun to play. It reminds me of all the times I used to play with plastic soldiers except these move and fire. Which is, of course, the whole idea. Great game, buy it! That's an order!!"
5,WAR,"Sarge's Heroes 2 is an improvement over the original Army Men: Sarge's Heroes. The graphics are better and the 1 player game is better, at least I thought, than the original.In the 1 player game, you play in missions and complete objectives in different environments ranging from a toy store, a pinball machine, a refrigerator, to a freezer and a train set. The missions have you switching between playing as Sarge or Vikki and along the way you are assisted by different members of the team as you battle your way up to Plastro!The multiplaye is an improvement with new battlefields and more characters to play as ranging from Grimm to Brigette Bleeu.If you enjoyed the original game, then you will love this. Rent it or buy it its up to you, and if you did enjoy the original, I strongly recommend that you buy it."
5,GREAT GAME!,this is the best N64 game created! so much fun and some intersting twists in it too. better then the first! more levels in our world then theres! if you have a N64 get this game!
4,AWSOME GAME!!!,"I rented this game, pretty sure I will buy it, its awsome, intense... I loved it! The last level is great!"
1,What an idiot,"The heroine is an idiot, pure and simple. If you accidently get this book, you only need to read about 1 in 50 pages. NOTHING OF VALUE HAPPENS! I cannot read or recommend books where the heroine is a silly nitwit. The story would have been better with the cousin as the heroine. Marianne is just boring."
1,Disappointing,The t-shirt looked good in the beginning but the ink proved to be unstable later on. In contact with my antiperspirant the illustration got smeared and the areas surrounding the drawing were stained with the black ink. I really expected more from Affliction. This is certainly my last purchase from them.
3,Nice one for the price I paid,"I had gifted this to my sister. Though she has not used it much, the prints she has got from this camera are very good."
5,Olympus Infinity means great pictures,I have the Infinity 105 and the Infinity 80qd Both cameras are easy to use and give great pictures over and over with very few poor shots.If a shot comes out bad it is usualy the photographers fault not the camera.
4,bloomig adictive,This is a great book for whiling hours away-regardless of how old you are. Remember the old Laurel And Hardy short with the jigsaw puzzle with the missing piece??? That's what looking at one of these books is like!!! You will NOT put the book down untill you find a certain character-and then curse yourself for not noticing where he/she was sooner. Definitely top class entertainment!!
3,Just know that it is a very small book,"If you are looking for a Where's Waldo book that is very small than this is the book for you. I was hoping that it would be an 8x10 book but is is approximately half that if not smaller. You have to have very good eyesight to find anything yet alone Waldo. After I got it, I looked it up online and noticed that it said ""Mini Edition."" So really it is my fault for not paying attention."
2,VERY SMALL,"Difficult for a 5 year old to find waldo, even with the magnifying glass. Difficult for a 40 yr old as well!"
5,loving the gold...,I really like good quality studded belts and this is one of them. I like the gold studs much better then the typical chrome. The price was extremely reasonable. This will be one of my most used belts and seems like it will last a long time. Very happy with this purchase.
4,the same album as the FOX BAT live in California 1976,"This cd is a similar album like ""On the wings of russian foxbat live in california 1976"".This one is a US American released, and the booklet was written by Bruce pilatto and another one is a British european repackage pressing, the booklet was written by Simon Robinson (DPAS)if you already have bought another one, please keep away from this one! the cd's have the same song and set! featuring Tommy Bolin on guitar."
4,Great for the Casual Purple Fan,"I had read that Purple with Tommy Bolin had some added dimensions like funk and R&B. Nothing against Blackmore, but this live CD was very refreshing for me - I normally tire of Purple after a while, but I listened to this one the whole way through the first time - and then listened to it again. It's a step forward in stylistic terms, and brings more to the table then sheer volume, but it's still Purple. Mark 2's accomplishments were legendary, but it's good that they tried something new even if it wasn't a commercial success.I didn't give it 5 stars since the old songs were sung better by Ian Gillan - Coverdale is just as good a singer, but his style is a little different."
4,Mark IV,"the best performance ever made with Bolin on string guitar,...much better than Last concert in Japan 1975,...the short life of the band's career caused the DP fans all over the globe very sad,...especially In the USA,....the band became a big nostalgia, because the Mark IV disbanded in 1976,..it was DP tired hours...need I say more??"
4,Featuring Tommy Bolin and the Mark IV Line-up!!!,"This CD features the band in their most experimental state, with Fusion/Rocker guitarist Tommy Bolin at his rocking best as the first real replacement for Ritchie Blackmore. This line-up was probably the best combination hard rock and funk line-up of all time. The mix from King Biscuit is spot-on as usual. The line-up is David Coverdale (Whitesnake, Coverdale/Page)doing his best impression of Paul Rodgers on vocals, Glen Hughes (The voice of Rock!!!, probably considered one of the best vocalists in soul rock ever.. ) on bass and lead vocals (ex-Trapeze, Huges/Thrall, ex-Black Sabbath), Tommy Bolin (ex-James Gang, solo act, various bands that he led), Jon Lord (The best keyboard player in rock, ever!)on Hammond Organ etc.., and Ian Paice (one of the best ever!!!) on drums. This CD features the band when they were in there 20's and 30's so it is very different and full of surprises... buy this CD!!!"
2,"Same, Same, Same","Same songs on every other live album, but poor sound. Save your $$$ & get Nobody's Perfect."
3,Depends on what you like....,"Greg Lake, performing Emerson Lake & Palmer, without Keith Emerson is about what you would expect--pompous, over-the-top and with dopey synthesizer sounds.However, this disc has three saving graces. First is Gary Moore who, as always, is as underrated as Lake is overrated. Gary Moore playing 21st Century Schizoid Man is almost worth the cost of the disc. Second, the band is very tight (like the trousers in the Rutles). Third, ELP aside, Greg Lake WAS present for some really fine, inventive progressive music and the final 2 King Crimson tracks are outstanding. Obviously, the band knew this and they saved the best for the big finale."
3,"not bad, but not ELP","Greg Lake's voice is legendary, and here he displays the power and emotion that made ELP chart-toppers. His voice is still rich and resonant, though a little deeper, and when he hits five notes in one word it makes you understand what using a voice as an instrument is all about. Best rendition of ""Lucky Man"" I have ever heard (and not one of my favorites); not bad for what is admittedly a last minute filler for ELP's first album.The rest is what you'd expect from an 80's type album. If you liked Aldo Nova, you'll like this. Gary Moore's guitar sounds like Carlos Santana's on 'Pariesenne' and is quite good if you like lots of guitar riffs. Excellent tracks from his King Crimson days for the ending. If you want to hear Lake's famous vocal hits from ELP, better to get the 'From the Beginning' retrospective, at least for disc one. If you like Greg Lake's voice no matter what, this is not a bad CD."
4,60's Clapton,"From his beginnings up to Blind Faith. Documentary with good concert footage. It focuses on the early Clapton with bands as early as The Roosters.the Yardbirds.It starts with little boy Eric born in England and each step along the way. The DVD has some rare photos, clips, performance clips and great information making this a great DVD.Early years with archived Clapton interviews. Commnetaries from frineds and ex bandmates about the young Clapton.It is a two hour DVD and does not drag making it well worth it!"
4,Good overview,Quite a wide range of info provided in this EC DVD.Good to see some of the people that weren't necessarily known outside of Britain at the time those that were just below the radar.
3,Kind of..,predictable. At the end of the book you can kind of figue out what is going to happen. This book is also very slow and hard to get into. You really have to keep reading to get to the good part. I thought that this girl complained to much also.
4,Very detailed book about Dutch houses in the Hudson Valley,"This book describes the history of a large number of Dutch colonial houses including many details about e.g. window frames, doors, hinges, locks and other things you need when you build a house.All photo's are in black and white, but no other book is available with so many details as this one."
1,Do not be fooled!,"This story has none of the depth or intrigue of ""The Rose and the Entire"" series.Plodding and truly laborous to read. I was thankful when it was finally over.Numerous typos throughout the Kindle version. Really sub par. Save your time and money."
5,Pretty and Unique,I bought this necklace for my mother's birthday. She loved it. It's a unqiue design. I highly recommend it.
2,I needed to modify the bolts to install...,"Quality and construction seem fine, but it took me WAY more than 30 minutes to install. The main reason for this is it is impossible to get the bolts inside of the frame without either drilling a much larger hole for them to fit through or shaving off one side of the bolt so they can squeeze through a little oblong hole already there. Once I found a big grinder and the bolts were modified, it literally took maybe 15 minutes to install.Glad to have it on my minivan, but it would have been nice to have some warning that there would need to be modification, either to the frame or the bolts to get this installed.Tools required: sockets and a LARGE metal drill bit to drill giant holes in your frame or a large grinder to modify the bolts."
4,"Well built, made for the DIY installer.",Hitch is well constructed with complete instructions and hardware. Definitely a DIY project if you can crawl under your rig and use some simple hand tools. My biggest complaint about this item is the packaging. Most Amazon products come fairly well boxed and protected- not this one. Only wrapped in brown paper and then put into a UPS plastic wrap bag. Item arrived scratched up cosmetically but no damage to the integrity of the hitch.
3,Not Worth It - Not Insightful,"I read this book about six months ago, and I found that the book had almost no ""take-away"" value. I didn't learn anything from it--except about the author's life story. She doesn't provide insight into why she cuts or why she stops. Ultimately, I'd save your money for Alysa Phillip's ""Stranger in My Skin"" or Caroline Kettlewell's ""Skin Game"" (listed in order of preference). Especially read Alysa's book if you're looking for insight into why cutters cut or if you're a cutter and looking for someone to understand why you cut. Read Caroline's book if you want a, albeit brief, reason to consider stopping."
1,Boring zzzzz......,"I have tried to read this book four different times and each time the author seems to show no emotion or feeling. I realize that she is depressed but, I believe that for a book to catch the readers attention it has to be at least somewhat interesting. I am glad I only paid $3.00 for it at a used book store. I would have really been disappointed if I had paid full price for it plus shipping. Being a recovering self injurer myself I know a thing or two about how it feels and the emotions you feel and what you are going through and I feel that the author just doesn't explain it very well."
2,Wasted Money,"I was very disappointed with this book. I also have bipolar II, have been in recovery for both an eating disorder and self-harm just like the author. I got the book because I was looking to relate to someone else who was/had gone through many of the things that come about when dealing with bipolar II, self-harm , and an eating disorder. I found little relatable grounds because I felt she skipped out on diving into the true depths and complexities of these disorders and maladaptive coping mechanisms. Instead, I found myself skimming over sections because I wanted to be reading more about her cutting, the reasons she did so, why she stopped, and the therapy she went through and more about her bipolar II. A bulk of this book covers her ""geographicals,"" moving every other two chapters. I love memoirs but this book had trouble keeping my attention and I got nothing out of reading it."
1,no insight whatsoever,"She has no insight whatsoever. I am glad that she feels that she is successful in ""recovering"" however, this book is not useful to anyone. It's superficial, as are her relationships. Her writing style seems lackadaisical. There are way, way, way too many good books out there on the topic of cutting and bpd. If you want insight read ""Get me out of Here"" or read ""Lost in the Mirror."" Both are the best."
5,Useful and interesting document on Victorian costume.,"The Victorians put their (mostly) best foot forward in this collection of period photographs. Most of the photos are obviously studio pieces and catch our ancestors at what they considered their best, but a few, like the picture of the little girl missing a coat button, seem unplanned.The photos are grouped by decade and show men, women and children of all ages and social classes. The editor's notes are conveniently placed near the photos and contain clear and interesting details about the costumes. Together the notes and the photos provide a useful resource and fun browse for all those interested in Victorian costume and manners."
1,Very disappointing CD layer,"I haven't been able to play the SACD layers of this disc yet, - that has to wait until the planned purchase of an SACD player next year. However, I have played the (16 bit, ordinary) CD layer and it is terrible, - dull, opaque and a far, far worse transfer than any previous CD incarnation of this performance. It's as if DG just tossed it on. Unlike Philips, their Universal classics stable-mates, whose CD layers are high quality, DSD (re)mastered 24 bit (re-)recordings, DG have missed the quality-boat. I, for one, will refuse to buy any further DG SACDs until they announce a change of heart and policy about CD layers on hybrid discs. ONLY buy this if you have an up and running SACD player. DON'T buy this if you're expecting a re-mastered hi-quality stereo CD. Shame on you DG, shame!!"
1,"poor sound,get the cd","this is the first time that I ever received an sacd that was worse than the cdmaybe I have a bad copy, but it is not as good as the cd's available by vonK on DG--not by a long shot"
1,So incredibly lame,"After 15 minutes, this got tossed into the ""resell it on ebay"" pile. How weak can you get. The idea of 4 player smash fests, along with using all sorts of weapons sounds really cool...until you realize this is a souped-up version of the ratty old ""Combatribes"" arcade game. It was so easy, no matter how insanely hard I set it to , no matter how bad I let them beat me up before jumping in to fight back.So you can throw a car at someone..whooopeeeeeee. In the 4 player arena mode, it's a joke, invariably one player gets picked on by everyone, and slowly but surely, you are left standing because you were smart enough to hide out for 2-3 minutes before jumping into the fray.This game is bad,really bad. What were the programmers thinking on this one ?"
4,great sounds with a little work,"The phat cat was better then the stock pup I had in my sheraton but not quite as good as the p94 I have in my dot. Great pick-up for the price, worth every penny."
2,why the american godzilla why why!?!?,"this set would be great if only they released it as the three new dvds coming out. but instead what you get is two good dvds and one bad dvd that you may even already own. if they had released this as a set of all three of the new dvds i probably would have gotten it but its not so i am not going to buy this. if you want these three movies than buy the five disc set with these three the other new dvd and a new godzilla 2000 special edition with the japanese version included. although that should just be a four disc set, but i wont get into that here. don't buy this unless you are a insane fan and must buy all three dvd sets just for the boxes."
5,The Two Gets Five...Stars That Is,"Riveting, fast-paced and enjoyable. I look forward to reading all Andrea Dean Van Scoyoc's works.--Big Bambu"
1,Mac users BEWARE,"Even though the packaging states Ver. 12.0 will run on a Mac, be very careful. The product DOES NOT run on newer Macs with Intel Duo Core processors.I found out after 3 calls to Symantec support. On the last call, I demanded to speak with a supervisor who admitted the shortcoming.To make matters worse, I have to wait 60 days for Symantec to refund my money!!"
4,Siblings won't play,So far the 12 and 13 yr old kids will not play together. But we will keep working on them. The arrangements seem to be OK for a 3rd year student.
4,America rocks!!,This album proves America can rock when they want to. A very good representation of their live performing talents.
1,dissapointed,"I ORDER JUST THE SAME TENNIS WE CAN SEE IN THE PICTUREI RECEIVED SOMETHING DIFFERENT, WRONG SIZE, WRONG COLOR AND ANOTHERMODEL.I SEND THEM BACK BUT STILL WAINTING TO SEE THE REFUND IN MY CREDIT CARD.THE OTHER SHOES WERE OK AND I M USING THEM NOWTHANKS IN ADVANCED"
3,The Girls Next Door TCS,"The only reason I watched this show because of Kendra damn it shes hot and Bridget is hot too this show was on intill August 7, 2005 - August 2010 wow 5 years and only 91 epsiodes."
3,Fun but uneven and underdeveloped,"I bought Giants with gleeful expectations. In some regards they were met, as a lot about this game is quite fun. The reviews I'd read online made it out to be utterly amazing.Unfortunately, it didn't fulfill these expectations. Yes, it is incredibly witty, everyone will get several laughs out of it. It is pretty and gameplay is largely interesting. However, it is not without its drawbacks. First, it is very buggy and performance is horrible, even on my rather decent system (Athlon 800 w/ geforce256 ddr). When compared to Sacrifice, which runs beautifully on my box with full detail, it is aparent that the Giants engine wasn't worked on enough. Patches haven't fixed this.Also, the plot is very shallow, and the action can get awfully repetitive. Controls are fairly poor, e.g. Kabuto's minions aren't usable as they were intended because they must be micromanaged. The game has potential and a few laughs, but is ultimately lacking."
4,"A good game, but it could've used a longer QA period","Clearly, this game was released before it was properly tested so that it could make it for the holiday. The game is LOADED with bugs. That's not bad though because this game is FUN.The system requirements are unusually high, and even on a powerful system, it is very difficult to run it smoothly. Still, a great game."
1,the non review,"I would love to give this potentially good game a review but unfortunately it constantly locks up and it took me numerous days just to get to the third level.I finally gave up. My system is very stable and plays ALL of my other games without any problems and it is relatively current,i.e. 1000p3/geforce2, etc. My suggestion to all potential buyers is to wait until the new patch comes out and check with the message boards to see if it fixes the numerous bugs,crashes and lockups."
2,Patience is a Virtue,"I heard terrific things about Giants: Citizen Kabuto and was sadly disappointed when I finally purchased and played it for myself. The most obvious annoyance was the lack of an in game save option. I just don't have patience to play the same mission over and over. And over. If you believe patience is a virtue, you can develop it playing this game. As for me, I couldn't even stand to finish it."
2,KIDSY fun,"I wish I returned this game within the alotted trial period. Unfortunately, I kept it. Initial impact is great visuals and sound. The game is somewhat enjoyable and humorous. But as far as actual gameplay and sustained enjoyability, this game falls short. As Brando said in On The Waterfront, this game ""coulda been a contender"".This game is an action game where you play as 3 civilizations...each with their own attributes. A 3rd person(Tomb Raideresque) or 1st person(Half-Life) perspective can be used. This game integrates puzzle elements to the combat. Unfortunately, the puzzles aren't difficult and the combat is poor.This game was very popular and my review is probably going to be an exception...but check out my other reviews to see if you'd agree."
3,"Great cast of illustrators, so so quality of stories THREE AND HALF *","This is a story about prodigy who uses his mind for progressing crime ladder and becoming the main boss in city. It has elements of superheroism, and reminds me of anti-Batman type of person.Maybe you should read Devil by Deed first and then Black, White and Red. Red White and Black is like a sequel to this (it should be collection of short stories illustrated by well known faces in business), but THIS book + 4 Devils One Hell+Macan's Devils and Deaths are much better than other Grendel/Grendel Tales titles. Of course , if you can get Eppy Thatcher Grendel comic books they are also good.The Best Batman AND best Grendel story for me is Batman/Grendel two issue mini series/crossover, where devil/Grendel Hunter Rose comes to Gotham city. It is written and illustrated by MAtt Wagner. It is best story I have mentioned in this review."
2,rather dissappointing,This is not a patch on what matt wagner started off.Those expecting a brilliantly drawn series better look somewhere else.The book boasts of heavyweight contributions from illustrators and writers but in the end its a let down.Of so i feel.
4,Only in the UK,"This looks like it would be a very useful book -- if you live and work in England, Ireland, or elsewhere in the United Kingdom. It specifically does NOT include information pertinent to the United States.For the UK and Ireland, it lists newspapers and magazines, book publishers and packagers, TV/film/radio resources, publishers of poetry and plays, literary agents, societies, prizes and festivals. It also has chapters on writers and the Internet, copyright and libel, finance for writers and artists, art and illustration, and photo and picture research.It is a practical and well-organized guide. But ONLY for the UK."
4,British Market (Mentor at www.AuthorsSociety.org),"This desktop reference contains hundreds of pages of information that writers and artists need for their professional work. The hints and tips are useful especially for newcomers or beginners.Although the book provides details of U.S. agents and publishers, it doesn't cover other U.S. information that would have been useful, for example, literature festivals, prizes, etc. UK information is covered reasonably well. Recommended for artists and writers interested primarily in the British market."
4,Citizen Tanouye,this was a DVD I bought for myself I used it to teach my class about what it ia to be an American the DVD wasvery good set up for High School kids
4,These swabs are the best,"This little swab works really well for soprano recorder and sopranino. Exactly what it is described for. Inexpensive, and gets the spit out. perfect. Get a full complement if you have bigger recorders though. this one won't do anything for an alto or bigger."
4,Man,"There are plenty of reviews out there already. Needless to say, this is quality. Man Incorporated, for those of you that don't know, is a one man act. A dude with a giant kick drum and a bass guitar. Enough about the awesomeness that is Man. The MP3's are poorly encoded - lot's of artifacts, spend the extra six dollars and buy the cd."
5,everything you could hope for in sesame street,this is the only video that keeps my 18mt old daughter entertained and its a whole hour. i love all the songs well except where the frog sings i think is too slow almost sad other than that all the songs are catchy. i would definetly recomend this video
1,What a disappointment,"This should have been titled ""African Celebration"". I am pissed. The songs are incomplete, there is this African Ceebration that seems to monopolize the DVD and it was carelessly put together. Major waste of money here."
1,Sesame Street a musical review,Bought it for granddaughter. When I opened it I found that the DVD was cracked all the way across. Unable to play and granddaughter was very disappointed.
1,"Uninspired, awful!","I hate this video! Sesame Street is one of the worst shows I've ever watched in my life! I love the episode that Dr. Phil and Dr. Feel are on, but they're always in my head! They're awful! If your preschooler asks for this video, tell them NO because this video is awful and he or she will not be happy when they get this video."
1,Very disappointing!!!,"Be warned! Many of the classic Sesame Street songs listed on the back are only short clips spliced together. Argh!!! We bought this for classics like ""Rubber Duckie"" and ""Put Down the Duckie,"" expecting to get the full songs that appear on other Sesame Street video compilations. The filler in between is a lot of cheesy 80's music that is too erratic and choppy for younger viewers."
4,"A bonanza of funny, classic, lovable Sesame Street songs.","This DVD contains 27 wonderful songs like: Sesame Street Theme, Rubber Duckie, ""C"" is for Cookie, Happy Tappin' With Elmo, Dance Myself to Sleep, I Don't Want to Live in the Moon, Sing, and many many more songs.I took a star off because has no special features or subtitles, but it's still very good. I've watched it 3 times since it arrived a day ago!"
2,what a shame,"...to put on a DVD the same quality than a (bad quality) video tape: the sound is average, the pictures too, and there is absolutely NO extra DVD features !On top of it, the story is slow, and the songs are just average, a pity that the good ones are of course at the end... I have wasted money to buy that one, and of course my 21-month old daughter finds it boring.Invest your money in the Elmo in Grouchland story, which is much much better."
4,"A Fun ""Review""","My 2 year old granddaughter adores Elmo. I got this knowing that Elmo would be included, at least a little. If you are looking for something that features 1 character, you may be disappointed, but it is a great review of a lot of the characters feature songs. - like Oscar and I Love Trash. I think we like it pretty much."
4,Good but could have been better,"I love Seasame Street and wanted a good trip down memory lane. I want my daughter (she's only 3 months old) to grow up with my favourites. I was a bit disappointed in the dvd. I was hoping for a lot more ""oldies"" and I would have preferred to see the entire sequence for the rubber duckie songs. I was also looking for the words to help me sing along. Put in the lyrics please!"
5,"5 stars, 2 thumbs up...& unlimited smiles!","My 10 month old daughter LOVES this video. Having watched it over & over again, she recognizes the characters, their voices & the songs. She bounces & toe-taps -- and smiles throughout the entire tape! Kudos to the developers of this classic! (OK -- I'll admit it! I often catch myself humming these addicting/catchy tunes throughout the day!)"
5,"Warning--Not for adults, but toddlers love it","My husband and I could hardly stand this video when we first got it, but my 18 month old loves it. He watches it over and over, and cries when we have to stop to rewind it. We are buying a second copy for the car. And, I now have to admit that the songs stick with me all day, and aren't so bad after all."
2,Duckie Dive,"True, this DVD manages to capture the attention of my 14-month old for minutes at a time - more than any other video so far. So, on that level, let's give it five stars. However, on every other level it is a major let-down. There is no DVD menu, forcing one to start from the beginning every time it gets put in. Second, some of the best songs, including ""Rubber Duckie"" and ""Happy Tapping with Elmo"", are grossly abridged versions (yet we get a full-length treatment of ""I'm an Aardvark."" Go figure.) While we do get a full ""Monster in the Mirror,"" that pleasure is negated by an incredibly weak performance by Kermit in ""Being Green."" Seems Kermit was having an off-day in the studio; his rendition on the Platinum CD is much more powerful.In short, this is not what is advertised. It's a cheap knock-off, with misleading packaging. Rather than a ""greatest hits"" it's a boring (even by children standards, ask the above 14-month old) frame story with edited songs."
4,Great Movie,"I have two children a 14 month year old and a 7 year old and they both think that this movie is great. My little one watches this during the morning, so I can shower and make breakfast. This movie has been fun for the children and a lifesaver for me."
5,Any age will do.,"I actually purchased this for my Grandson - he is in High School now - because of one of the songs he wanted to use for an audition to a top choir at school. He was watching it in my room with me and enjoying many songs he remembered from years ago. My Son, in his 40's now, heard the music and came in to see what we were watching. HE remembered many of the songs too! No matter your age, if you grew up in the USA and had a television, you know these lyrics. I have yet to see anyone that can't sing-along and tap their toes. Pure enjoyment and a piece of our collective memory. Now THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT!"
5,Reminder of my Childhood,"I got this for my daughter this last holiday season, I used to have it on VHS when i was younger my grandma got it for my brother and I when we got the chicken poxs. My daughter may be to young to really enjoy watching tv but she sure loves to watch my sister and I dance around and sing to it. I love all the songs, my Favorite is the Batty Bat :)"
5,"Never mind the kids, I LOVE IT!","As a grandmother, I'm getting a second round of Sesame Street (which I always loved when my own kids were small). This particular DVD is adorable. It has all the classic songs I (amazingly) still remember the words to: Rubber Ducky, Sing, I love trash, C is for cookie, Sing, and many more. They are woven together in a loose plot of looking for performers for a show Big Bird wants to put on, but it is basically a collection of songs and lively dance performances which keep the little ones riveted.It is longer than most DVD's which last about a half-hour. This one is a full hour, so you probably won't watch the whole thing in one sitting. It has all the classic characters and a couple that weren't there when I stopped watching, but are equally charming. It's fast-paced, upbeat, funny, colorful, & entertaining. If you are starting a collection of videos, The Sesame Street 25th Birthday Musical Celebration is, without doubt, the one to get first."
4,My son's favorite DVD!,"My son has had this DVD for two years now (he just turned three) and it's by far his favorite movie to watch. It's about 45 minutes jam-packed with Sesame Street goodness - counting, songs, favorite characters, etc. Yes, it's pretty dated - I think most of the songs came from 30-40 years ago, but it's still very cute! Mixed in with the songs and classic clips are scenes from Big Bird, Pairie Dawn and Telly making their own musical on a sunny day in the park. Highly recommended!"
5,my 2 year old son loves this- and so does mom!!!,I love this dvd- It is wonderful- it has all of my old favorites and brought back so many memories- there is however a review that someone wrote indicating that there was a remark made that they would be in big due-due if this project isnt done- or something to that effect- I have watched this dvd- over and over with my son and I have not heard that said once???? so I am very confused as to were this person heard this---- however- I have to say that I would recommed this to any mom who is looking for a great DVD- that they too can enjoy!!!and that wont drive them crazy!!
2,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to this video of Classic Sesame Street songs -- the stuff I grew up with and sang. Unfortunately, the songs I was most hoping to see have been edited to make room for the added-on story -- Big Bird, Prairie Dawn, and Telly's search for dancers, singers, and La-la-la-ers for their show. This video didn't make much of an impression on my 2-year old daughter either. I think I would have preferred to spend my money on Blue's Clues videos."
5,Great Fun,"I bought this DVD for my 4 month old son because we don't get Sesame Street where we live. He just loves it. He loves to have conversations with Big Bird, Telly, and Prarie Dawn as they put on a show.His favorite song is ""I love Trash"" sung by Oscar the Grouch. My son gets very excited about the Rubber Ducky Medly and though I wish the songs had not been shortened he likes it and that is what matters to me.He didn't like the fuzzy dancing creatures, they scared him and I have to skip to the next song but the rest is a lot of fun for both of us. I find myself singing those songs to him even when the video is not on."
3,Only snippets,"Though we are huge Sesame fans and I am old school Sesame, this DVD has some great oldies BUT only snippets, not the whole song. A lot of these songs (the entire song) are shown on other DVDs and most of these songs can be seen on Play With Me Sesame everyday on Sprout. I would recommend the Play With Me Sesame videos over this one so little ones can see the entire song."
4,Mostly clips from 25 great years of Sesame Street,"Watching this video is very similar to watching an episode of Sesame Street on PBS...only not exactly the same Sesame Street that's on the airwaves today. It has musical clips from various episodes throughout the lifespan of Sesame Street and contains more clips of Bert & Ernie and Grover than you will see in a typical episode in 2001.It's not just a series of old clips, however. The clips and new material are woven into a story of Big Bird looking for LaLa-ers for the show that the Sesame Street characters are planning. Not everything fits just right, but it is fun to watch and sing and dance to.The most important reason for my high recommendation of this video is the fact that my 22-month-old son is FACINATED by it. It may not be teaching him his numbers or his alphabet, but he is starting to try to sing along.Not the absolute Best Video out there, but thoroughly enjoyable and worth the price."
5,"Great songs, great characters.","The plot is simple and silly: Big Bird, Prairie Dawn, and Telly decide to put on a show, and look for singers, dancers, and ""la-la""-ers. Big Bird runs into some trouble finding the ""la-la""-ers, but everything works out, and it's really just an excuse to show musical clips from the first 25 years of ""Sesame Street"", bringing back great memories for anyone born in the mid-1960s and after who grew up with ""Sesame Street"", and entertaining our children who are about to grow up with ""Sesame Street"". This tape is better than ""Elmopalooza"" because the song clips are the originals, not new versions done by celebrities (with one exception: ""Sing"" performed by Ladysmith Black Mambazo and the ""Sesame Street"" cast with lots of children), and this tape is lighter than ""Elmopalooza"", in which everything goes wrong and the characters freak out. My son is 14 months old, and has watched this tape more times than the Count can count."
2,What a disappointment!,"When I saw this DVD available, I thought I'd found a sort of ""Greatest Hits"" compilation. It lists the featured songs on the back, which include manu Sesame Street classics. It failed to mention that all of the Rubber Duckie songs are cut short and mashed into an unsatisfying medley. The songs are all showcased within a story about Big Bird looking for ""la la-ers,"" which makes this feel like a bad clip show. I realize that this was a TV special, but the way that the ...story cut into classic songs grated at me. To top it off, this DVD does not include menus or anything to help viewers navigate the disc (of course, it is an older DVD). I really hope that someday soon they decide to release a real ""Best of"" Sesame Street DVD, with each segment shown in its entirety. I would love to see these classic songs along with some of the great non-musical moments. Unfortunately, in this time of Elmo-centric releases, it doesn't seem likely to happen."
3,"Cute, but a bit annoying","I bought this for my son (and as a nostalgic DVD for me) and found the original clips fun and my son enjoys them too! BUT the newer clips (in between the ""vintage"" clips) are annoying. The extras and actors are terrible."
2,Disappointing,I grew up on Sesame Street and the Muppets and thought this would be a great DVD for my 18 mos old. But I thought the song selection was terrible. Really disappointing!
3,Okay - Not real excited about this video,I was disappointed with this video - I feel like I could have taped a few episodes of Sesame Street and I would have gotten the same material. If your child loves Sesame Street and you don't feel like taping then this is the Video for you. I didn't feel there was a lot of new material.This video is compiled of bits and pieces of Sesame Street from the last 25 years. Some adults may find this video reminds them of there childhood.
2,Disappointing,"I'd rather see a complete collection of actual classic clips from the show than the brief snippets offered by this DVD. Some songs I wasn't interested in interspersed with cuts of the songs I thought I was buying.DVD master is terrible. This has just been duped from VHS. No clean-up, no menus, no extras.Also no captioning? Shouldn't Sesame Street encourage us to read along?"
2,very disappointed,"I bought this video hoping that it would be great sesame street quality. Although there are parts to it that are fun and nostalgic for me(e.g., rubber ducky), the newer segments and newer songs with people (rather than muppets) are disappointing and boring. My daughter walks away when I put it in....unlike 1-2-3- Count with me and Alphabet Jungle..which she adores and which have truly helped her learn her numbers and letters."
5,Sesame Street DVD's,My grandchildren adore these DVD's and the order was filled promptly and shipped out in a timely manner. Price was lower than most big box stores.
3,A little disappointing,"Looking at the song titles on the DVD, it looks like a fabulous collection. When you actually play it, 4 of the best songs (Rubber Duckie, The Honker-Duckie-Dinger Jamboree, Put Down the Duckie and Do De Rubber Duck) are just snippets, not the full song. Very annoying when they are cut off so quickly and they are listed as if it is the full song included!"
5,It's a Dog's Life,"We see things from Sally's perspective- the story told with humor and wonderful pictures. My 3 year old granddaughter and I hope Sally goes to a lot more places- the beach, mountains and farm could be just the start."
5,Sally Goes to the Beach,"In this book Sally is a black lab who gets to go on vacation at the beach. This book is from Sally's point of view. She describes everything that she sees on her trip. The illustrations are very colorful and the dogs look just like labs I know. One of the coolest illustrations is of the island that Sally goes to, it is shaped just like a black lab. The sentences are simple and it would be a good book for young children in grades k-2."
1,Sally goes to the Beach,"This book was never shipped and I was not notified until over a month after I bought it! It was supposed to be sent as a gift, so it never got to my nephew and I did not find out about it until well after his birthday. Very disappointed!"
1,not a good flavor in my opinion.,"I dislike this flavor. I will try a different flavor though, as I think this cracker may be very good. just bad luck on flavor."
1,Too oniony! Taste is off!,I'm sorry I ordered these chips. The taste is not good at all and the smell of onions is too strong. I disagree with the first reviewer. I have learned the hard way that you can't return grocerys. Unless you have had these before..don't buy!
2,Good but a bit too strong!!,"These are pretty good but they a bit too strong, if you have a date or want to be kissing someone don't eat these within 24 hour of that time or you might turn them off.."
4,good idea,this is a exellent idea put forth byt the CTW. There are several of this specialized videos made for any topic that a child might be having trouble with. This one highlights the math of sesame street which is presnted in a fun and entertainging way. Exellent video for a sesame street fan or a child that is having trouble w/ math.
2,Learning To Add And Subtract 1987,"Parents,This video show simple addition and subtraction that your child might learn at the end of K5. The Songs are Addition Song and They Can not Take that Away From Me. Enjoy this video."
2,not very good...,"the only good book bruce and stan wrote was their, 'guide to bible prophecy' these 2 just keep writting stale/boring outlines."
3,Jacked by the jack,Product was damaged prior to being shipped and boxed up that way. Seller has not resolved and manufacturer is not stepping up to the plate. So without the broken off pieces it would be hard to know if this is a great product.
4,Correction of earlier reviewer.,"I have not thoroughly reviewed this DVD, so my review may deserve another star. I just wanted to correct the earlier reviewer who said the subject was not draped and wore a thong, while the therapist did not demonstrate draping techniques. I can only conclude that Ms. Wilkinson viewed a different video. The subject was wearing nothing, but was constantly draped in one fashion or another. Indeed, the therapists emphasized draping techniques. In that respect and all others that I can determine, the presentation was extremely professional. Ms. Wilkinson was most definitely not reviewing this DVD."
4,stone massage,"Good basics, take a class also if you are trying to learn how to do stone massage. I took Aromatherapy hot stones massage after I watched and practice the DVD"
1,CORRECTION FOR REVIEW WRITTEN IN 1999,"PLEASE USE MY NAME WITH MY REVIEW DATED AUG. 1999. IT NOW HAS A ""MUSIC FAN"", I THINK MY NAME WAS ACCIDENTALLY REMOVED. IT DESERVES ZERO STARS, IF THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE LEAVE THE ONE.THANK YOU, ABBIE CALDWELL"
2,Toy Caldwell - Can't You See: Great Music/Poor Quality,"I am a HUGE Marshall Tucker and Toy Caldwell fan. While this CD is certainly a welcome release from the late artist, almost anything is to a die-hard fan, the quality is just plain poor. There are live re-releases of both MTB classics and Toy's '92 release, as well as two previously unreleased tracks. While the songwriting is wonderful, and the live actual performance was probably great, the quality of the recordings is just plain terrible. While the liner notes boasts a lack of ""enhancement"", some modification would have improved this release. I think Toy would have agreed.JMH"
3,Good Material!,I prefer the 1992 release over this live CD. It could be better if some enhancement work was done.
2,Poor Tribute to One of the Greats,"The late Toy Caldwell was a great musician. Most significantly he was a brilliant guitar player and songwriter. While he was not, for obvious reasons, the lead singer for the Marshall Tucker Band, he was the lead singer on many of the group's classics, including the venerable ""Can't You See"". This CD is simply of poor quality. The production is horrible and Toy's singing, raspy on his best day, is just plain bad. While the liner notes boast that the CD is not altered or enhanced, it should have been. Toy deserved better."
2,unlike the other reviewers - I WAS THERE!,"I was there at Shooters (the name of the bar here in Spartanburg, SC) when this was recorded. It was actually 2 nights, 2 sets each night. It was sort of a last minute thing, not a big production. It wasnt even sold out the first night! He had fun, the crowd had fun, just an overall good bar band show. I am guessing this was just a soundboard recording for Toy and the boys to see how they were sounding and of course not planned to be released publicly. But, being it is probably Toy's LAST ever live recording especially of this sound quality, it should be released and enjoyed by his fans."
2,"Cheap, cheap, cheap.","These were not exactly the same length as each other. Defeats the purpose! Also, they came warped slightly and they warped more over time. Totally annoying to try and use these with the Miquon Math program. Save yourself much trouble and buy the traditional wooden or plastic ones. If you must have the connecting aspect, buy Unifix Cubes instead.Would not buy again."
4,Great for beginning math concepts,"Each number from 1 to 10 is a different color so students can see the numbers and how they relate to other numbers. There are suggestions on how to use these rods for addition, subtraction and even beginning mutliplication and division. They were recommended by another homeschool mom and I wanted to have manipulatives on hand for my Kindergartner. I would recommend these for use with children who love hands-on activities and are visual learners."
5,A big help,"My only regret is not having bought and read this book sooner. I helped me through every step of the application process, which is more than I can say for my university's law school advisor."
3,Vinaigrettes are horrible. The rest is good. Mediocre overall.,"This cookbook is a mixed bag. Some of the recipes are terrific (e.g. duck), as one would expect from Charlie. Yet, I've tried 2 of his recipes with vinaigrettes, and they are wretched - very heavy and oily, with very little artistry. For example, one called for 3/4 cup oil and 3 tablespoons of orange juice.I'd be shocked if he ever tried these, either at home or in his restaurant.Overall, disappointing."
3,great for the price,"for the price it was great, fit was loose, but acceptable because of the low price"
3,White one didn't have a hole for my phone's antenna,the black one was great but the hole for my antenna was missing in the white one. Too bad. that's the color that i liked most. I bought them a while back and the black is still going strong.
2,"I had to modify it to use, then found them too ""sticky""",The holes were not in the right place so I cut the rubber to fit better. I tried it for a couple of days but it was too sticky and kept bothering me when I tried to put it in my bag. I wound up going with a different protection device.
2,item not as pictured,"just to save someone else any hassle......although the pics show ALL the buttons exposed, the actual cases i received covered the top row home keys and only leaves the ""qwerty"" keys exposed. i just emailed the seller and made them aware of this. prices were great, though, if you don't mind the covered buttons. i do, as i kept hitting the wrong key."
5,Life Changing,"I'm a religious man, and besides the holy scriptures this book has had the most profound impact on my life. It's simple ideas allowed me to let go of much in my life and see others with more patience and love. It's relatively short and a great read."
5,Buy This!! Robin's Great gig from daze gone bye!! AAA+,King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents: Robin Trower In Concert by Robin Trower .....This Live KB recording is just awesome. Back in the day they used to play the video as well as the Music on the radio so we could crank our stereo's when we watched it. I only wish we could have the video to go with this audio! If you like Robin Trower this is a Must have. Great song selection and great sound quality. James Dewar is superb. Bill Lordan does a grat job. Nice to hear his original drum approach to the music. And Rustee Allen on Bass. All Original from a time that is no longer. Im very glad I bought this!!
5,You Will Listen to it Over and Over,"King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents: Robin Trower In Concert (1977) is the best live Robin Trower album available. It captures the power and grace of the super group of Trower on guitar, Jim Dewar on vocals, Rustee Allen on bass, and Bil Lordan on drums. Highlights of the recording include Somebody Calling, Too Rolling Stoned, Little Bit of Sympathy, and Messing the Blues. The songs are tight and controlled, but there is ample room for improvisations. With each listening you will notice new tidbits of guitar and vocals. I have nearly worn out my copy of the album, you might also."
3,A Gift,Never listened to personally. Gave it as gift to someone who really loves his music. The receiver said it was a good listen. Something to consider giving as a gift.
4,Love point and shoot cameras,This is exactly what I wanted. Film camera with no computer required! I just wished I had got two of them.
3,Chain is too thin,"The Opal is beautiful, but the chain is too thin. The chain is so thin, and you need to be extremely dexterous just to get it on. My girlfriend likes it alot, but I need to get a thicker chain so that she won't fear it breaking off of her neck."
4,Nice watch but...,I bought this watch as a bday gift for my boyfriend last month. He liked it and has been wearing it since then however we noticed that it easily get scratches on the links.
4,A WATCH FOR AN SPECIAL OCCASION,"This is the third watch I get from Amazon, and I would like make this review from 3 points. First the watch itself, is exactly what I wish, an elegant timepiece just for special occasions, as some one wrote the dial does not have seconds hand or date, because is for those moment you do not care much about the time and maybe you will want it was for ever. This black Museum Dial is just beautyfull! Second I want talk about the price, the suggested retail price for this watch is US$ 795,oo, and the stores in the web sold it between $ 377,oo and $ 550,oo. My price at Amazon was $ 344,oo shipping included! Third, I ordered the watch on September 25 and for October 2 it arrived in excellent condition, this is very good for me. I think the best accesories for an elegant gentlemen, not wearing jeans, are the wedding ring and a beautyfull watch. Vicente."
5,i like this,thankyou i like this movado for me and next time i will buy more for this watch and save more money thankyou.
4,Great Deal,"This is the second watch that I have bought from Amazon. This watch arrived in 2 days, brand new, in all the original packaging. It definately looks better in person. I comparison shopped and all the major retailers are selling this watch for $695. Only one site is selling it for less than $695, and they want $450. I haven't given it to my boyfriend yet, but I'm sure he'll love it!"
5,Truly a Marvelous Piece!!// The Art of Time!!,"I received my watch yesterday, and i love everything about it.. Although it took me some time to adjust to it... I must say the link is easy to get scratches on.. Beside that,I received many complements throughout the day!! Great buy.. Think about it, 300$ watch can last you for a LONG TIME!!"
5,Great Value!,I own a few Movado watches and this is a great looking versatile everyday watch and Amazon has the best prices available. I would suggest that you be mechanically capable of making watch band adjustments as with all better quality watches it may need to be fit to your wrist.
4,"Only live recording of the classic, Mach 1 line up","Recorded in 1975 just as The Original Soundtrack was breaking through on radio (with I'm Not In Love), the quartet (aided by touring drummer Paul Burgess)produce a striking live set that covers their first two albums (although tracks were recorded featuring songs from OS and How Dare You! they, mysteriously, don't show up on this disc). The live format benefits many of the songs from the first album that didn't take flight in the sterile environment of the studio.Sadly, none of the band's better b sides to their singles are performed (4% of Something, Waterfalls). These can be heard on the recently reissued/remastered edition of both 10cc and Sheet Music. They never got any better than this although they certainly became more ambitious."
4,"Good Quality recording , 10cc original line up","This is a 10cc fan gotta have as it is good quality recording live no dubbed.it is also the same recording as the record album bootleg called ""going pink on purpose""which i own as well.i would recomend this cd to 10cc fans."
1,Movie didnt even work dont buy from this buyer,"This is yet by far the worse thing that could happen. Got this movie on Saturday and put it in my dvd player and it said ""disc not found nor read"". How disappointing i will never buy from Amazon again this is just a scam to get peoples money what a shame. Just returned it yesterday , I'll be waiting for my money, once again Amazon has failed yet again. What a shame."
5,DWIGHT YOAKAM - REPRISE PLEASE BABY,"AWESOME COLLECTION OF SONGS IN 4 AMAZING CDS. GREAT AMAZON SELLER, GOOD PRICE, AND FAST SHIPPING! THANKS!"
5,"Dwight Yoakam, Reprise Please Baby","Dwight's Reprise Please Baby box set is FANTASTIC, thoroughly enjoyed the music and the cover/booklet is now on the shelf as a display. So good I bought two copies, one as a gift for another Dwight fan.Reprise Please Baby: The Warner Bros. Years"
1,very poor quality,I watched this and would have probably liked it if the people who made this video had taken the time to produce a decent product. The lecture volume swings from low to extremely distorted and at times cannot be heard much at all. It was very disappointing considering the price and during the lecture Will Henry had slides that he presents with use of a laser pointer and you have no idea of what he is really showing to you or pointing to on those slides which are also barely legible on the video. My advice would be to pass on this one it isnt worth the time it takes to watch even if you got it for free.
1,Shocking,Who does William Henry think he is releasing this piece of S*%t. The quality of both the video and audio is very poor. No time or care was put into the production of this DVD. When you pay over $50 for a dvd you would expect it to be of decent quality. This is the first and last William Henry product I will ever buy. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. Shame on you William Henry.
1,One Star is too much!,"This should be minus one star! All the reviews here are spot on, so no need to add more. So unprofessional! Try David Wilcock! Much better."
2,Very disappointed,"I received my Gazelle with the box completely thrashed and the DVDs are busted to pieces. So, I thought that I would try to put it together anyway only to realize that there are no instructions. Like the other reviewer mentioned, I am left with a ton of pieces and having to study a picture to figure out where they go. Definetely not worth the money."
3,Workout & Guesswork-out,"When you sell something that comes in pieces, an instruction booklet is very important. The machine seems simple enough, i got the basic structure together. After putting up the main frame, i find myself with about a dozen small pieces that i have no clue about. Well, thats easy...I'll consult my instruction booklet. What??!! No booklet??!! I suppose i can always study the picture on the DVD's it came with and give my brain a workout of it's own. Otherwise I'm lookin forward to using my Gazelle....as soon as it's finally assembled."
5,mesh duffle bag,"Love this bag and the price is great. All of my sons taekwando equipment fit easily with room for his uniform., THe open design will hopefully keep it from smelling"
2,Impossible to carry,"Though the bag is nice and large, the shoulder strap for carrying it is ridiculously long. The bag dangles down at your ankles making it hard to walk while carrying this bag. It only gets longer which would be even worse..."
5,The Finest Slice Of Live Pie Your Ever Likely To Taste........Please Give Us The Full Set!!!!,"They just don't make bands like Humble Pie anymore.This is an incredible live album and deserves a much higher profile. There is some GREAT guitar playing throughout but at the beginning of 'Blues I Believe to My Soul', when played loudly, it's almost as though you can actually `feel' the wood resonating on that Les Paul. :-)I have contacted KBFH to try and find out if the rest of this amazing show is buried in their archives...fingers crossed that they still have this material if it was recorded, it would be a crime for it to remain unheard forever.A 2 CD 'deluxe' version would be a dream come true."
5,The Real Rock N Roll Goods!,"You know, I like the Black Crowes. Really, I do. But every time I listen to them I get the feeling that something's missing, especially in regards to their live cds. So, when it's time scratch a serious rock n roll itch, this is where I turn!Comparing this or Rockin' The Filmore to any of the live Crowe releases makes it clear that the Pie was the real deal!! Steve Marriott was an incredible vocalist/showman and the band as a whole just rocks!IMHO this KBFH release is so good (Hot And Nasty is worth the price alone!) that it's even better than Rockin' The Filmore - which is a stone classic in it's own right. The track listings are distinct enough that you should own both of them."
3,Season 1 was a bomb!,"Sure it was funny back then, but this is the year 2000 and we have a much better sense of humor. However, the family theropy scean is worth giving this one 3 stars!"
4,Brief but informative,The booklet is very brief but does contain a fair amount of information and technique. The booklet was very inexpensive so it is worth it.
5,Typical Great Boomers,"I usually use .09 Boomers top wrapped on my Les Paul's and SG's to get a more slinky feel. So I ordered these thinking that maybe I could tighten the tail piece all the way to the body andstill get the slinky feel using these. I wasn't disappointed. They feel great,keep in tune and really last through a lot of bending. Great tone and great strings!"
4,Another great read of mid-evil battle,"This is another good book in the dragon series. If you liked the first you will surely like this one. The one disappointment I had with this book was that it leads you to believe there is much magic involved with the plot. However, in the final grudge there is really no magic but more strategy and war than any magic battle. The final ending does bring you back up to speed with an unsusspected surprise. Once again the mid-evil thriiler will grab you in the end and bring you back to the next book in the series."
1,Software on Amazon,"When selling software, it is very important to mention the version of the software. I was trying to buy TomTom Navigator on Amazon. So, I was very happy when I found it. Unfortunately, there was no mention of the version of the software being offered. This in unacceptable. When I zoomed in the picture representing the package, it appeared that the version number on the box was 2.0. The current version of TomTom navigator is 3; they are about to release version 5. In other words, you were selling an outdated version of a software package and the buyer had no way to know about it. Shame on you."
5,"Very enjoyable, entertaining music...","Kingfish was a highly entertaining band, especially live as this cd proves. Any rock n roll band that can make me actually enjoy the Marty Robbins song ""Big Iron"" is truely amazing. There's lots of other great songs too, all done very well by Bob Wier and band mates. Anyone who likes the Greatful Dead and just all around great rock, will love this. Worth the money. Get it now!"
1,BAD,This game stink's - If U want a GAMBLING game then I would BUY Royal CASINO alot more to this game
