5,AWESOME,"The best video game value...EVER! I've played Diablo 1 & 2 off and on for the past 15 years. Log on to BattleNet and still to this day, the servers are FULL of people playing."
4,diablo battle chest,i barely have time to do anything else . the best thing to come out of california!!!!!
3,Can't play,Damn Apple changed the operating system so you can't play old games on new systems. Was that necessary for improvement?
5,very fun game,"I love this game. I had the older one and I thought about getting the 3rd, but decided to go ahead and get this one. IDK when 3 is actually gonnabreak and what to expect."
4,Too much time.,"I really like the Battle Chest Edition of Diablo, but I have one complaint. You can't just turn Diablo II on and play a quick game. In the past I had only played the orignal Diablo and I compleatly enjoyed the game. With Diablo II and the expansion I think the game is compleatly awsome except for the fact that if I want to play a game I need to set aside an entire day to play."
4,B+,"While this game is somewhat lacking in variability due to the static plotline, it is still given some replay value due to the various classes. It is a lot of fun."
1,Won't launch on Windows 7,Only buy this game if it is inexpensive and you are willing to lose your investment. I have installed this game and its patches on 3 different computers with i7 processors and 8-16 Gb RAM. 2 computers have NVidia cards while 1 has a Radeon video card. Regardless of compatibility settings it will not launch.
3,Old game perfect for killing time,"This is a REALLY OLD game, but it is fun to create and build new characters and given the option to play with other players."
3,"Diablo II, and diablo II Expansion, StarCraft, BW, WCIII FT.","I liked playing all the blizzard games, WCIII I did like best. But the cheats got to much for even me to handle.I wouldn't touch the games now. Even StarCraft is hacked . So are all the version Of all the Diablo's, it's Real bad that Blizzard can't stop the third party programs. But they let them continue. Kids can't compete unless the to download the cheats , Then they get banned,."
3,Original Diablo fan is dissapointed,"ok i first played diablo on a demo, the original and i thought it was GREAT. The full version wass FANTASIC. This versioind is only GOOD. Why? it comes with more levels and all-in-all it's avery good game. But you can't save as you go, which you could do in the original game so this sort of spoiled it for me.If it wasn't for this i'd give it 5 stars. The graffics and quests are great, the cinematics are much better than the two you were stuck with in number 1. I've yet to try the multiplayer over battle.net though.i was a bit dissaponted bu none the less a good game"
3,Diablo I only runs on classic,"It says that it runs on OS X 10.4 and 10.5, but this is only true for Diablo II. Diablo I only runs on Classic for Mac, and trying to get an emulator to run it, especially for Intel machines, is a huge pain."
5,THIS GAME IS AWESOME,"I recommend this game, is truly the best thing blizzard has released, and I played for 10 years, is a truly addictive game, 5 stars."
4,I was impressed,"I was definitely impressed with Diablo II. The expansion only made it better. The graphics, the gameplay, everything is flawless. I have only a few pet peeves with this game.A.) Playing single-player[blows]. This game basically steers you into playing online.B.) I had a lot of lag online. I have a cable modem. And I had lag. That's not right.C.) The game is way to difficult. I put it down and gave it back to my friend because he would make fun of me for not leveling up by 20 every hour. I barely got to level nine in a week.Still, however, it was pretty fun, and quite addicting for a while. I would reccomend it to anyone."
4,Great game for lower end machines,"Diablo II is a great game. The expansion pack makes it even more fun. If your like me and haven't kept up with the latest games and hardware you will enjoy this hack and slash adventure.All my hardcore gamer friends make fun of me for playing such an old game, but my entire system costs less than the graphics card they need for the latest games."
4,Diablo 2 good/or bad,Well if you were like me i thouht i was going to get ripped off on the game so i just decided to get the game and try it out. When you start off you pick your person/or hero. Then you go to a little town like home base. Then you get into the game you can talk to other players or be there friend. So I think i got my moneys worth. This is know my favoite PC game i hope you like it to.It is action packed and you can play with your real friends.
2,Stay Away!!,"Unless you enjoy crack cocaine and other highly addictive substances, this game is not for you! I don't know how Blizzard stumbled on the perfect randon-reward system to ensure a large section of the community would never get a tan again, but I wish I had back the 2 solid years of life they stole from me."
2,Diablo 2 When I kill a monster I like it to stay dead.,This review is for those who plan to play Diablo 2 off-line and not online. This game has some really serious design flaws. The first being the inability to save when you want. The second being every time you exit the game the monsters repopulate forcing you to replay that area over again and losing an hour of so of your time. Also the storyline wasnt that interesting mostly just hack and slash and I lost interest half way through the game which has never happened before.
3,Not up to the old SuSe standards,"I've been running various versions of SuSe Linux for several years now. It seems a shame that their level of quality appears to be suffering now that they are working for the Novell bottom line.I do professional development, and while the distribution is relatively OK, it was surprising to find that the development system as distributed doesn't seem to know much about threads (certainly not the debugger). If all you want is a client side system, then this distro will probably work for you. If you are more serious and in development, try another distro. Even Fedora Core 4 looks better."
5,Stellar Songwriting,"I met Slaid at the Kerrville Folk Festival a few years ago. Slaid won the New Folk songwriting contest that year, and for good reason. In my 10 years working staff at the folk festival this is one of the best artists I heard. Slaid mixes country, folk and blues influences, writes beautiful tunes and heart-wrenching lyrics. Buy this CD. You won't regret it."
5,Excellent,"VERY interesting to read, does not condescend but at the same time does not leave the layperson baffled. Well done. Enthusiastically written and modular--if you skip chapters no impact.HIGHLY recommended for anyone with even a passing interest in scientific method, insects, and biological sciences."
5,Beautiful and Rustic Charm!,Very nice quality and very easy on the eyes. Not only do my kids 7 and 4 love them we love to look at them too! Larger in person then expected but a wonderful addition to the house. Shipped timely.Nice sepia toned letters.
3,Fair,"This was a pretty enjoyable book. Judged against other Star Trek novels it is not the best but is far from the worst. It won't really give you more than the movie does. I enjoyed it about as much as the movie but in different ways. Instead of being impressed by visual effects i was intrigued by the thoughts of the crew. Two blunders: on page 97 Data is described as ""near breathless""--well Data doesn't breathe. And on page 157 describing B'Etor's attraction to Soran the author writes ""...despite the fact that he was a puny human..."" but he isn't he is El Aurian. But I can live with those mistakes."
3,Ghost ship Reliant?,"OK I know I'm a fanboy, but when Kirk is killed in the book they mention the time he was on the ghost ship ""Reliant"". Reliant was the ship Chekov served on that was commandeered by Khan. The ghost ship was USS Defiant. You would think someone would have caught this. Kinda ruins the atmosphere for me."
1,don't buy this,"Oh, PUH-leeze. What a way for a publisher to get money. Make an abridged audio adaptation of a written novilization of a movie? 3 products, same thing (more or less). Don't spend your money on this. Go buy the book novilization. It's written well, and if it's the collector's edition, it has pictures from the movie."
4,music,la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la music is a personal choice I'm not going to review akll my music choices-listen & learn!
5,KNEEL IN AWE,"One of the best pieces of music ever recorded. Not a bad song on the whole CD. Unique ---unlike any others. LOVE ""Traffic"""
4,Classic Traffic,Great Traffic album. Owned 2 vinyl copies over the years.Saw band at Electric Factory (Phila) right after this came out.
4,A great album! not their best...,"Mr. Fantasy, Traffic, Jahn Barleycorn- the order they came in and the priority for purchase... Not because older is better- its just coincidence- Barleycorn is a bit folkish- not that that's bad- Winnwood, Wood, Mason and Capaldi are just better at the experimental bluesy rock..."
5,This Great but short CD is better than the cluttered `deluxe' double set,"Traffic / John Barleycorn Must Die (single CD with one bonus track): This is a Great but short album. Every track on this album is classic and (even as short as it is) it is an Essential album. This CD adds one bonus track, ""Sittin here thinkin of my love"" which is very good. This album deserves a five star rating.There is another version of the album, a 2 CD ""Deluxe Edition"". That version has a couple of outtake tracks and an ok live performance from the era. However, that edition does not even add the ""Sittin her thinkin of my love"" track that is found in the single CD described above! The ""deluxe edition"" I would describe as `cluttered but album length'. In comparison, the single CD is much better than the ""deluxe edition""."
4,(5 stars for the title track),"Just one correction. The official review above mentions the title tune vocal as being one of Winwood's best but Jim Capaldi handles the lead for most of the song with Winwood singing harmony on the choruses. I was privileged to see this tour and the highpoint of the show, for me, was this ancient song performed with acoustic guitar, tambourine and flute to a quiet crowd in the middle of a rock concert."
2,"Classic album,sadlystill not given its due",Great album.Over priced reissue.With all the minutes available on these cds and all the music from this great band there to be put on it and not to see it here is a crime.You know with the cd market shrinking you think they'd get it right for the true fans that are still buying.
2,Thinly plated with brass!,"Okay, when you order something that ought to be polished brass and then within a week the finish starts wiping off to reveal the nickel or stainless steel below, it's hard to be impressed. Finding polished brass accessories to go with expensive bath fixtures was not an easy task and though the drain assembly is fine, the over flow cover and it's 2 bolts are not."
5,Apple iPod works great!,"I read all the reviews on the iPod, from Amazon, CNet, Mac World, etc, prior to buying my iPod. I was particularly concerned with the criticism and problems attributed to the iPod. However, my personal experience with my 5GB iPod, has thus far, proven very positive. I have not experienced any of the problems that the other reviewers cited. It is easy to set-up and use. The sound quality is okay, though this can easily be improved by upgrading the earphones. My only negative comment is that the unit takes too long to charge up (4 hrs)."
4,Excellent +++,"My Husband gave me a christmas gift, I love it, its stores around 1000 songs but for me 100 songs are more than enough. Sound quality and overall features are excellent, the only bad part is I still didn't found a good case for IPOD I looked everywhere from Apple store to EBAY but they were not good, but other than that I had no problems till now.I hope this review is helpful."
4,Just enough to make some important points,"I have used this book with my women's group at Church to encourage them to listen to classical music and to appreciate the varied but strong relationships that these brilliant men have had with the God who gave them their incredible genius. While this book may not satisfy a purist or an academic, it is just right to introduce classical music to a spiritually-minded and intelligent (but not musically sophisticated) group. I love it and highly recommend it to those who appreciate spiritual confirmation, Christian or otherwise."
1,Nothing like the item pictured,"I ordered this unit because the filter holder is the nice looking finished unit as seen in picture (square casting, powder coated, labels, etc). The one I received was a cheap piece of unfinished die cast zinc with lots of sharp edges, no markings, etc. the filter cartridge I received was ok, but the holder was crap"
4,Good book!,"This story is short, but you wish it were longer. However, it is it's ""shortness"" that gives it so much life and the reader so much enjoyment. Good book"
2,Am I the only one? ...,"I really wasn't that crazy about this book. I love Danielle Steel, but I guess I like reading more of her stories about adult relationships, whereas this was focused more on young teenage love, trials, and tribulations. It wasn't a bad book, if you are interested in this storyline, but for me, I prefer her stuff like: Lone Eagle, Irresistable Affairs, etc."
2,Wouldn't recommend it,"I'm a big Danielle Steel fan, but this book was way too predictable and I must admit, was a little boring... I give it 2 stars just because I'm a big fan."
5,Wonderful,I read this book when I was pregnant and I cried almost all through it. I finished it in one day. The book touches the heart.
1,Tripe,"Ugh. My mother pressured me into reading any book by Danielle Steel, and I chose this one because it was blessedly short. This story was as contrived, predictable and melodramatic as any soap opera out there. I saw the ending coming a mile away. I would have been willing, even happy to admit there was a shred or originality in this story, had there been any."
5,A Heartwarming Story,"The Gift is a heartwarming story about a sixteen year old woman who accidentally got pregnant and has found new life with another family after her father temporarily disowns her.It has a short novel with a simple plot that would give faith and hope to women who have the same experience of the main character,Maribeth Robertson.It is one of the outstanding novels written by Danielle Steel that many would truly enjoy inspite of the typical elements present in it just like the others she has written.Great read for everyone."
4,Great emotional read,"This story packs of heck of a punch. The characters were so vivid, at times I thought they were real. I'm not a Steel fan, but this one impressed me to no end. If you're looking for a great read with lots of emotion packed between the covers, this isn't one to pass on!"
3,"Entertaining yet predictable, elementary-level reading","This book was interesting. It is written at about a fourth grade reading level. The book isvery predictable. Halfway through, I knew what the ending would be, and I was correct. THe characters are easy to relate too. Daneille Steel develops the characters and their relationships well. Overall, I give 3-stars."
4,A taste of the real world.,"I thought this book overall wasn't bad. I thought that, like many of Mrs. Steel's books, it had quite a few sob scenes that seemed to never end. A good read for the summer."
4,The Gift,"I found this book to be somewhat interesting. I admit it was hard to put down, even though it was very predictable. It's one of those things that you just have to keep reading to make sure that you're right.About the ending...I didn't like it too much. It left me with too much to wonder about. I figured it was going to be like that, but I can still whine.I suggest this book to those who like the fairy tale endings and such. It doesn't exactly end as a fairy tale would, but it'll help to escape reality for a couple hours."
5,un si long chemin,"un grand livre, plein de passages emouvants. j'ai dévoré ce livre avec enthousiasme. Des sentiments mlés de joie ,de tristesse, d'espérance."
2,Sappy and Unreal,"This is the first Danielle Steel book I've read and the last. The whole premise was unreal. These people were 16 years old, for heaven's sake, and Steel made them so mature as to be unbelievable. It was sappy. The ending was so unsatisfactory I have to wonder: Is there a sequel? If there is, I won't be reading it."
2,'Love' appears more than necessary.,"I just finished this book, and as much as I liked the story, it dragged on too long, and was horribly predictable. It was not the brain candy many of us seek, built boring and common characters, and seemed to be repeating itself. As soon as you read the back, you already know that she's leaving the baby behind. And what ever happened when Maribeth left? I never found out. But with the predictability, I'd say she married that guy and had some kids. The book didn't really seem to be much about love, probably because the word showed up too many times. It's easy to read, not much thought required. Good for ages 10-16. Can be finished easily in a night."
3,A Pleasing tale.,"This is the type of book a person would read if they were utterly depressed about life. Unlike what someone said before, (which was not to read it if you are upset), I think it's the type of book to read if you don't want to hear about never ending horrors or the world gone bad. It's a sweet book. That's really all there is to it. Of course reading about anyone's death is horrible, but you feel at peace in the end like the characters did, because everyone loved the child, and she had the best life possible.Maybe her life was a little too wonderful. At times it was too idyllic, and life was too perfect. But I think it's enjoyable to read a book like that every now and then. Despite how predictable it was, I still finished it all in one night, and despite what most of the reviews stated, I was rather pleased by the ending. Not sad at all."
2,11-year-old book to fight for a 7-year-old child.,This is a sharp attorney who needs to bring this book into the 21st Century. I found several good ideas that seem to be making a difference.
4,a great gret help better than the other ones,this book helped me tremendously it is concise and well sritten and factual. I founf thingd out inthis book i may never have known at all. It helped me prepare my case really well.
1,"How Can They Say ""WOW""? I just can't see it.","Just more lawyer talk. I got it from my lawyer and it didn't help then I bought this book and get it again and it still doesn't help. This advice may help if you want to end up in court. Not good advice in any case. Take the time to find something with more hands on, and do it yourself advice."
5,Excellent Book!,"Purchased this for our son who's going through a divorce where he's been in an abusive marriage. This book is very insightful and provides basic and very informative, useful information."
2,Court Is Not Where We Want To End Up,We have watched others follow this advice and then with all their good efforts still lose. We need more input into the process. Finding and trusting a good attorney just isn't enough. We are going to keep looking.
1,Don't Buy This Book...Self Promoting,There are many useful books on this site to read and study concerning a Father's Rights. Check them out and read each review carefully. It is too easy to get burned. Choose advice carefully and perform your due diligence.Don't be fooled. Do your research carefully and look for recommendations from people who have received proven results.Author has done good work in the state of Illinois bringing attention to Fathers' Rights but his radio ad's for a brochure are pure marketing gimmic.
4,Father's Rights is right,This will be short and simple. The book offers great advice. My son can only pray this helpful informaiton will help him in his custody battle. I recommend this book to all fathers seeking their rights and to the Judges who make those decisions about the father's getting their rights!
2,Great In Theory But Needs More Specific Information,"Good book to get motivated with examples of supposed real situations but lacks the nuts and bolts of getting custody. Does not refer to real cases. In order for a book of this nature to be a real tool in custody fights it would have to be very State specific. It is written in a very general light with good information, however this is subject matter that requires specifics."
4,Diamonds are a girl's best friend,"I dunno know why I never wrote a review about this book. I enjoyed listening to it on cd last summer.The main character Mma Ramatswe is a middle aged lady detective of traditional build who is aiding an American woman whose son disapeared years ago and was never found.Mma Ramatswe sympathises,she lost a child too and it still bothers her sometimes. The mystery is a bit of sleeper, but that is fine. Because their are all these little subplots happening,( along with a romance going on) along with musings from all the differant characters about what Botswana used to be like versus what the country is like now.( It reminds me of what America was like forty years ago) How woman in Botswana are having a little woman's movement of their our own and trying for their voices to be heard. I also like that Alexander Mccall does this weird thing called humour taps. He taps you on the shoulder with little zingers of humour and then leaves."
4,Continuing the fun...,"Another superb book in the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series; fantastic characters, vivid scenes, and fascinating stories. Off to the library to get the next one..."
3,Mma Ramotswe is back!,"In this second book in the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, Mma Ramotswe is newly engaged to her friend Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni. Her fledgling detective business in Gaborone, Botswana, is doing well, and she takes on several new cases, including those of a cheating wife and a son who disappeared under mysterious circumstances. She also learns that her secretary, Mma Makutsi, has some detecting talents of her own.What is quickly becoming one of my favorite aspects of the books is the subtle ways the author provides small morsels of cultural information to the reader. Although chances are small I'll ever be fortunate enough to visit myself, I feel like I'm slowly getting to know Botswana."
2,"Interesting Story, But Not a Mystery","The book was pretty interesting and well-written, with great descriptions of Africa and its culture. The tone is refreshing, and there are several poignant moments. Unfortunately, I don't think Mma Ramotswe is ""The Miss Marple of Botswana"" because the story does not have suspense, and the problem at hand is not a real mystery.First of all, mystery books have danger. Perhaps Miss Marple never finds herself in a life or death situation, but at least her murders are usually fresh and not ten years old. As Mma Ramotswe herself admits, the case is ""stale."" I haven't read the other books in the series, so maybe those are more exciting.Also, I would expect a mystery to have clues. My favorite part of Agatha Christie mysteries is looking over the clues and trying to guess whodunit. In this book, they simply look up some old records and rely on ""intuition."" Oooh, how clever!"
2,Tears of the Giraffe,"This book is a coin toss. On one side of the coin, you end up with a true feel of Africa, the pace of the people, their thinking process. On the flip side of the coin, it is NOT a fast-paced mystery. It is predominately about the people and VERY, very slow-paced. Too many words. The 'mystery' is thickly buried within .. you have to dig and dig and dig to discover the what the mystery is ... much less the 'solving' of the mystery. Likeable people."
2,Not as good as the first very boring,After reading the first book which I loved I could not wait to read the second in the series and I was very disapointed. I found it did not have ebought mystery as the first one did. It focus's more on the main characters life I liked that in the first book but now it's just boring.I want more of her detective work. When they do have her detective work it's good and it's a page turner. Overall not as good as the first but I want to read the whole series to see what happends int he future.
3,Tears of the Giraffe,I chose this rating because of the ease of reading. The intertwined mysteries and relevant history and references to culture by Mr. Smith develops a great book. I also liked some vocabulary challenge. Christian character lessons are excellent.
4,"Cute, comfortable, enjoyable read","This is the kind of book one reads on an airplane. It's about 240 pages and there's nothing taxing about the plot. There's nothing sad to bring you down. Perhaps there's a joyful reunion to lift your spirits.At the same time one is taught the subtle or profound differences between Botswana and the USA, as well as countries closer to Botswana.Ms. Ramotswe is thoughtful, smart, full of common sense, and an unforgetable character of modern-day fiction. Apart from other detectives who are always unerringly never outsmarted, she is sometimes fooled by an adversary or the subject of her investigations...a purely common happenstance in real life, and she is all the more likeable for it.This is my second read of this series and I will probably read them all as long as the situation is right: a lazy summer afternoon on the porch swing, the aforementioned plane ride, or perhaps during an ill day from work."
5,Tears of the Giraff,"Alexander McCall Smith is a wonderful writer. He treats his characters kindly and with gentle humor. The story is told engagingly so one wants to keep reading. He tells a detailed and 3-dimensional story of Africans and Africa. This book continues the ""No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency"" series."
4,What a Great book!,"In fact, what a great series! The books hold your interest from the beginning, and are over much too quickly. Smith uses an extremely simple writing style, almost childlike, which is why the books move so swiftly. But don't let the simplicity fool you; there's a LOT of meat on those bones, pun unintended. Each story, each nuance and thought is a commentary on people and peoples' behavior in general. The whole cast of regulars -- Precious, Mr. JLB, her new assistant, etc, are engaging people. This is just super stuff."
4,Love Precious Ramotswe!,"I've read four in this series and this is the best one. I recommend it. Sometimes you have to trick white folks into reading about Africa. This does the trick. I love the humor and dialog and philosophizing. And I'm in love with Precious Ramotswe, a most precious lady."
2,Tears of the Giraffe,A real yawner! It didn't help that the characters names were too difficult to remember.
5,Incredible album,"Easily one of the best albums in recent memory. The album opens with such honesty and ends with such promise. It's absolutely solid from start to finish.Stand-out tracks include:I'm Bored, You're AmorousGraceIt's Getting EasyPaperbagMidwestern DirtAlso, get the limited release track ""Telemarket Mishap"" off of iTunes."
5,Love's Greatest Hits,"Track Listing:1. How Do I Live2. Foolish Games3. Tell Him4. I Believe In You & Me5. Kiss From A Rose6. I'll Always Be Right Here7. You Were Meant For Me8. Because You Loved me9. Nobody Knows10. If We Fall In Love Tonight11. I Finally Found Someone12. Something About The Way You Look Tonight[Disclaimer: The track list for this album is provided as a courtesy, because at the time of this listing, there were no song titles available on this page, for this title. We feel that you should be aware of what songs are on this album before making your purchase. Enjoy!]"
3,Alright item,"It was a decent product. I liked the fact that the ears stood up, but I was under the impression that the ""under outfit"" came with it, as the picture shows. Obviously though, it's only the mitts, feet, and cape. I wanted an outfit with a bunny tail. None here. :("
1,"Too Small Head Covering, Low Quality Overall","Had to return it since the cap was too small for my baby even though she was barely 6 months old. If you live in a cold area, this may not be good for a late October outing."
4,Great Costume,My daughter looked adorable with this costume. My only observation is that I had a hard time dealing the shoes.
5,Great - classic Disney!,"I have nothing unique to add to the reviews. I mainly wanted to add another 5-star to the rating to counter-act the 2-star given by that other reviewer. It seems everything has been sufficiently said already. If you enjoy this classic Disney film, I suggest ""Flash, The Teenage Otter"" and ""Hollywood Coyotes"" (I'm not sure that's the actual title)if you can find them."
5,Disney products,I have enjoyed all of the old Disney products. They have been wonderfully redone in color and they take me back to a better time.
5,LF- Talking Words Factory,This is an awesome learning tool. My 5 year old and 3 year old both love this video and sing the songs all day long..
5,My 22-month knows all her letter sounds!,"Not only does this entertain my four kids (ages 22 months to 6 1/2 years), it reviews old knowledge for the older ones and helps instill it for the little two. We mostly got it for our 3-year old, and were stunned when our little toddler proved herself able to say the sounds for all the letters on demand! Our kids now go around pretending to be letters. The 3-year old now knows the letter sounds and can blend words together for the first time ever--he'll be starting to read ""Bob Books"" in a few months! Part of the DVD's effectiveness comes from the way it manages to hit four of Gardner's multiple intelligences. As a public school teacher and as a homeschooling dad, I heartily recommend this program, as well as the first volume, ""Letter Factory."" I wish there were a volume 3!"
5,LOVE IT!!!,"My four year old son is obsessed with all of the leapfrog videos. After watching this one a few times he started sounding out easy words and trying to spell them. All of the videos get your child excited about reading and counting, it is wonderful."
1,False advertising,"Very upsetting... Recently brought Talking Words Factory 2009 because my son truly loved Talking Words Factory 2003. Little did I know that the 2009 version was the exact same as the 2003 version, but with a different cover. So I had to just give it to another child who could use it. If you dont own the 2003 version then this is a great dvd. My 5yr old loves it!!!"
3,It is ok................,I got this for my 14 month old son. He didn't seem to be interested in it when we were watching it. Yes....I know he is 14 months old but if he is interested in something I can tell. We have watch educational videos that caught his atention this didn't. I won't say buy it because someone else child may like it but my didn't.
2,"oh please, who spells their words all in capitals!","first, my 2 year old loves this video.it infuriates me however that the words are spelled all in capitals. who writes like that?! who learns to recognize words in caps, it does not accurately represent what they'll see when learning to read! do over - i wouldn't buy it."
1,Talking Words Factory,I ordered both this DVD...Talking Words Factory and Letter Factory.I DID NOT receive TALKIN WORDS FACTORY!!! Call me 785-506-4273. Thanks!Carol
3,It does not seem that my kids are interested,"I have purchased three of these, 2 from the words factory, 1 from the story book. My kids are seeing the two words factory ones. They are 4 and 6. It does not seem that they are interested as they never ask to see them, unless I make them see it before watching other movie videoes."
5,Learning disguised as fun for 2 year olds',"Wonderful intro to letters to form words in an interesting easy to follow story with the leap frog ""froggy"" family.Holds a 2 year olds' attention with its ""sing song"" way of sounding out the letters of the alphabet. Complements the leap frog toys - purchase separately - but incorporating an already fun fridge magnet talking alphabet toy - with the same songs are great for repetative learning. Highly recommended!!!"
5,Kids love it and it really works!,My son is almost 4. I got him the first Letter Factory for Christmas and he (and my almost 2 year old) cannot get enough of it and started sounding out letters right away. I rented this Talking Word Factory for them and my son decided he wanted to start reading! We were reading a book and he started sounding out what he saw!! Totally recommend these!
5,Great learning tool!,A friend actually recommended this DVD to us with rave reviews. We trusted their opinion and bought it. We've had the video for about 2 months now and my daughter (22 months old) loves watching it over and over again. She easily learned what the different letters look like and the sounds they make. I highly recommend this video to any parent.
5,great lesson,"I have 3 kids (ten, six and three) The kids love to watch this DVD. I'm happy that they can learn while having fun."
3,Lost interst quick,"It was fun the firts few times then my kids almost killed me when I tried to put this on. They lost interest quick, but maybe that is just us."
3,A little boring,"We got this for my son's 4th birthday last year. He liked it ok, but has watched it less than 10 times in 1 year. He already knew his letters, so I thought this would help him to start reading words. I think it helped a little, but not as much as websites like starfall. com and readingeggs. com."
3,It's OK,"This DVD is just OK. In our oponion, it is not as good as The LEtter Factory. MY four year still enjoyed this video but she seemed to get so much more out of the other one."
5,Better than Letter Factory -- quality learning video,"I'll admit, I thought the Letter Factory was pretty slow moving -- but my daughter loves it, and it's highly educational, so I watched it with her and actually started to like it. And, I do believe that it helped her learn letter sounds. Based on that experience, I bought The Word Factory, which is the sequel. I think it's better than Letter Factory -- a quicker pace, more interesting story line, and I'm seeing an even bigger leap in my daughter's reading skills. I recommend these videos to parents (even though they're painfully slow to watch)!"
5,"Good follow-up to ""Letter Factory""","I'm a parent as well as an English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teacher. We have really enjoyed using a variety of Leap Frog educational products in our home.The Letter Factory DVD is a great introduction to letters and their corresponding phoenemic sounds. Through the Letter Factory, my toddler child learned the entire alphabet and phonetic sounds in only two weeks.We purchased the Talking Words Factory at the same time. This film teaches basic reading principles using catchy songs to illustrate word building concepts. There is a song about how vowels are ""sticky, icky letters"", because they are the GLUE (sticky, glue) that hold a word together.This DVD is just as educational and entertaining as the Letter Factory. For preschoolers, I recommend starting with the Letter Factory film before moving on to this video. Both are a valueable resource."
3,Not as good as the Letter Factory,This is a good video....I expected it to be as good as good as the Letter Factory which it is not. It doesn't seem to keep the kids attention like the Letter Factory does.
3,Not as good as Letter Factory,"I purchased Letter Factory and my daughter knew the alphabet and all the sounds of the letters at 15 months, so I am a huge fan of that video and I recommend it to everyone. This video however, leaves much to be desired and pales in comparison.It's slow to get started and is not nearly as engaging as the first video. The voice of Tad is kind of cloying almost to the point of being repellent and the writing less charming. The way the information is conveyed, is in my opinion somewhat confusing and not well structured and the video is entirely too long, wasting far too much time, and attention span, on bad musical numbers."
5,Amazing DVD--Inspires children to learn!,"We already have the Letter Factory and naturally, we wanted to move to the next step. We bought The Talking Words Factory for my son's 3rd birthday. He already knows the sounds of the letters, but he really didn't have the desire to put them together until this movie. He has watched it about 6 times in the last 2 weeks and is learning to spell words by sounding them out. It has even inspired him to learn to write them. My son is very entertained by the characters and songs, but also learns from them at the same time. I plan to continue purchasing all of the Leaf Frog DVDs."
3,My Son Was NOT Interested,"I thought that because my son learned SOOOO much from the letter factory, he would from this one as well. I was wrong!! He watched this dvd 1-2 times before putting it on back on the DVD rack. The video seemed to move too fast for him and didn't do such a good job explaining how to form the letters properly. I was disappointed a little that he wasn't interested. I can't say that I would give my recommendation on this one. I love leapfrog though and will look forward to their newest products and services."
5,Excellent!,"My two-year-old daughter loves these Leap Frog videos. Ever since we started watching this one, she has started to question what different words are. I can tell she is understanding the idea of sounding out words and the idea that letters make words. Plus - the video buys me a little time to get dinner made uninterrupted. Love these videos!"
5,Love It,"Great learning tool for small children. Intended to buy several more, but I haven't had the chance yet. Very educational"
5,Wonderful,My son loves this. Not as long as letter factory but it get's the job done. For a 2 1/2 yr old to see the word cat and know what it is is great.
5,Disappointed,"Hello every one hope this rewiew would be helpful to someone....Let me start by saying that this product the ""LeapFrog- Talkin Word Factory"" is excellent...however when I pop it into my DVD player, there comes a message ""ERROR - wrong region"" I am living in the caribbean ....I never knew that these DVD's were for a specific region....I was so unhappy with leapfrog because I could not use the DVD player to look at it....But I pop it in my computer and it showed well, so I don't know what is the problem here.LeapFrog - Talking Words Factory"
5,Leap Frog - Talking Words Factory,LOVE IT. My daughter loves it. My school kids love it. It's entertaining and educational.
5,Parks and Crosby are Swingin'!,"Wow! How very refreshing in this day and age to hear these classic tunes once again. Mr. Parks has an absolutely GORGEOUS voice. He gives real verve and passion to his interpretations. The new arrangments are cheerful, and they capture the spirit of a bygone era! Christine Ebersole and Vicki Lewis bring a special sparkle to their performances. This album is a must for any fan of Crosby, good music, or beautiful singing!"
2,Little disapionted,"This item was a little disapionting for me. I ordered it thinking it was a truer, more peacock blue that would go well with other items I had. But as it turns out it is much more of a sky blue. Also the sizeing was a bit off and so I wasn't able to wear it when I had hoped. I accually haven't worn it at all because untill I get it altered it will just fall off!"
1,Poor Transfer,"After some delays, I received this much awaited movie. However, my enthusiasmturned into disappointment because of the poor transfer of the movie into DVD.There were several minutes of no sound and picture."
5,who done it? benny hill,As a young ice skater I was in this movie. Alas the skating sequence we were in was cut. Is there any chance of getting the UN CUT version?Benny Hill Who done It filmed in the 50's
1,Disappointing,"I was shocked to know that Target never thought of adding on curtains to match the valance.Maybe a Target employee can realize that curtains do need to be closed too, especially babies!In the meantime,pregnant mothers such as me need to drive around town trying to find curtains that will match the valance."
4,A Woman's Perspective,"I DO AGREE WITH THE PERSON WHO SAID THAT THE SERIES WASN'T DONE IN CORRECT ORDER; AS A WOMAN, I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LITTLE GIRL. IT WAS GREAT THAT RIPLEY WAS WILLING TO GIVE UP HER LIFE TO ELIMINATE THE QUEEN INSIDE HER. SHOWED ALOT OF COURAGE. ANYHOW, I LIKED THE MOVIE VERY MUCH!!!!!!!"
1,"If you liked ""Alien"" or ""Aliens"" - DON'T WATCH THIS","The first two movies in this series, altough different in genre (horror and action) were very well done and and fit together perfectly. The first movie moved smoothly into the next and made for an increadible journey. The third movie destroys all of the work of the first two. It seems that the producers/director did not like having a happy ending for ""Aliens"". They killed off characters that you rooted for the entire film (""Aliens"") without reason. They end up with a script that is just an ordinary slasher film. Creature chases good girl around huge building for 1 1/2 hours. The creativity and zest of the first two was lost. Do yourself a favor and skip to ""Ressurection""!"
2,Should never had been made.,"This film was completely unnecessary, Alien was a Masterpiece and Aliens was a brilliant sequel. There was no need to continue after Aliens unless they had come up with something really incredible. The film is a complete downer filled with forgettable characters that you dont care about and simply put, it's just boring.All the glory and victory from Aliens is wiped out in the first ten minutes and killing off Ripley is one of the worst decisions in cinematic history.It's weird, it takes place on a maximun security prison planet yet all the inmates speak with an upper class British accent. Even the monster is lame. Mostly it's just a CGI interpretation instead of an actual costume effect and it's poorly executed as well. Sigorney Weaver looks bored througout the film and it's pace is so slow that you just want the film to end.This is a movie that truly should have never been made."
2,Grim and Masochistic,"Director Fincher takes his death fetish to new lows in this grim and mostly pointless followup to Aliens. In this one, Ripley--perhaps the universe's most unlucky astronaut--washes up at a penal colony that makes Alcatraz look like a Howard Johnson's at sunny Myrtle Beach. She's joined by a dour cast of British unknowns (a wasted Charles Dance being the major exception), which coupled with the pseudogothic production design, makes the film feel like a bad Henry James novel come to life. With hints--hints--at some deeper meaning, the story basically rehashes the first film; this time, though, the apparent innovation is that prisoners are picked off one at a time by a fast-moving alien that has combined with canine DNA. Masochists undoubtedly will enjoy scenes like the child from the previous film, Newt, being autopsyed, but most viewers will just shake their head at this relentlessly unhappy movie."
3,a good follow up from Cameron's extroadinary sequel,"Alien 3 got bad reviews but for the wrong reasons, The movie was more about the story rather than alot of special effects, the effects it did have were fantastic, along with some really great camera work from the alien's point of view. This movie is a very good installment in the series."
1,Absolutely Sucked!!!,"I love the Alien saga, but this movie is incoherent and profoundly disappointing. The premise of it is not rational given the end of Aliens. So it starts with a ludicrous plot premise, and it just goes downhill from there. I love Sigourny Weaver, but this is the worst movie she's ever made.When we do our ""Alien"" film festival, we leave the piece of excrement out of the mix. I can't think of a single positive thing about this film."
4,The best of the Alien series,"It may be surprising to hear someone actually say this, but I think Alien 3 was the best film in the Alien series. It's use of atmosphere and style over plot seemed to work a lot better than the previous Alien movies plus I thought this one was twice as suspenseful as the original. The fact that no one has any weapons to take the alien down is a lot scarier than simply blowing it away. Director David Fincher knows what he's doing with this film, and he succeeded where Scott and Cameron failed. Alien Resurrection, the fourth film in the series, isn't bad either."
2,just a poor movie,"I remember seeing an interview with one of the actors from this film (the head of the colony, i think) on David Letterman and even he agreed that the movie wasn't very good. Perhaps it could have been, but too much was left on the editing room floor and the result was a disappointing mess. I'll buy the first two DVD's, but as far as I'm concerned there is no Alien trilogy."
5,I kinda liked it.,"Flying in the face of public opinion, but let's give it a try.We have a modern society, in an age so technical, it's possible to set up a colony in the most distant reaches of space. It takes hours for a radio message to reach Earth.Bad news, in this case, would be a smarter, faster, acid blooded alien psycopath stuck in a prison with you.Worse would be discovering that in the middle of all this technology, and the aforementioned xenomorphic nightmare, you are reduced to the 21st Century equivalent of rubbing stcks together to make fire.Yeah, the language is vile - it's R rated, and set on on a futuristic prison containing the absolute dregs of society. What d'ya expect, Barney? Yeah, there's a lot of gore, there's some god-awful alien beastie hunting people.In my opinion, it's a tight, slick film. Dark and depressing, offers very little in the form of a ""nice"" day out, but where it sets out to scare you, it's on the money."
2,Puke!,"This is one of those movies that just should NOT have been made, and everyone associated with it should feel ashamed. The first, and most glaringly obvious problem is the script. How this script got past anyone remotely familiar with ALIENS is beyond me. For starters, there are eggs on the ship. How did they get there? Impossible. Second, half the survivors die within the first five minutes. Is that supposed to be ""artistic""? I used to give this movie 1 star, but now I bumped it up to 2, because as lame as it is, it is still better than Alien Resurrection, which has no style to it. Alien3 at least has that, which is due to Fincher directing."
4,Largely Underappreciated,"Though it's not really fitting for a movie in the Alien series, Alien3 is an interestingly done if monochrome-looking exercise in religious allegory. Weaver handles the constantly changing role of Ripley well, combining both the independence shown in Alien with the maternal aspects of Aliens. This, combined with the rest of the cast and some effective camerawork, makes for what is at least an interesting film. It must be seen letterboxed for it to make any sense, however. The end of the movie (and what should have been the end of the series) is amazing, of course, and worth waiting for even if you find the preceding two hours unbearably dull. Give the film a second look (or a first!), but again, in its original Panavision format if possible; otherwise it becomes very visually garbled. END"
3,Could have been better; could have been worse,"I thought this movie was going to be absolutely awful...I was wrong, but it definitely wasn't great. Every character I cared about died early on or by the end of the movie and some of the CGI footage of the alien running was laughable. I recommend watching it, but keep in mind, the first two movies are MUCH better."
2,It does get better with time...,"The first time I saw this movie I wondered how they could mess something up so badly. The second time I found some parts had improved (but not by much).First, the alien was a mixture of cool, sleek, killing-machine but also looked somewhat fake on the small screen of the TV. The heavy use of computer graphics allowed them to do a tad more with the creature than you could do with a person in a suit.Still, the story takes away, I think, from the Alien myth. It made the drone a tad too smart and the beginning of the movie was a tad confusing. I still don't know how the young queen got in there without killing Ripley. Too many questions and no real answers. Mystery is good, but total chaos is not."
1,Alien 3,"This is the worst of the four. If they hadn't killed off the three wonderful characters introduced in Aliens it might have been an ok movie. But no, they make their ship crash on this planet of ""celebate"" prisoners and make Ripley the only survivor. And then, we get to watch as they slice open Newt's chest to see if there's a chestburster inside. And the rest isn't even worth talking about. I was really disappointed with this movie and you will be too. Rent it(if you must)first before you buy it."
4,"FINALLY this film is the way it should be, except..........",".......there is still the question of how did the ALIEN Egg get onto the SULACO in the first place!!!THAT HAS YET TO EVER BE EXPLAINED!!!Along with that is how is it in every other film of this series, the face-huggers die after impregnating one victim. So how is it one face hugger impregnated Ripley AND the poor Moo-Moo Cow thing in the extended version???I will simply say that after all these years, the extended version makes this film a true epic adventure, as I read in the attached booklet....the extended version was how this film was presented for approval from the folks at 20th Century Fox. Then Madonna's video-director-boy chopped the film up into something truly un-watchable.If you have seen the extended ALIENS film and LOVED all the extra footage, then this extended ALIEN 3 will be just as enjoyable!"
4,A good movie with a single flaw.,"I like this movie for the most part. In fact the only thing I didn't like about it were a few of the special effects shots where the alien looked really out of place. Which ended up breaking the all important 'suspesion of disbelief'. Too bad because the rest of the film is great. Directed by David Fincher (Fight Club, Seven, etc.) Great sets, and action. Moody lighting and music. Overall a great movie."
3,Mixed bag,"The ""Assembly Cut"" is the version to watch. There are around 30 minutes of additional footage and a more realistic ending (although visually less impressive than the original ending). The changes improve the film quite a bit but it's still something of a mixed bag."
3,This one is a mess!,"Its a must have if you want to complete your alien collection, but this movie is a mess. There are many places in the move where you can't even here the sound, or the people talking. There is even a warning before the movie is played warning you that you will not be able to hear parts of the movie. This is a really long movie, and there are a few funny parts that were left out of the TV version, but I would not waste your money on this movie unless you are getting it to complete your collection with all 4 movies.Not a movie I would sit around and watch too often but it's nice to watch once a year. It's really quite boring. I find myself turning it off in the middle as its very long and I get tired of sitting there."
3,"Actually, this isn't as bad as it's been made out to be.","In a way, it's an improvement. We kill off the pointless people from the second film, and we have several really talented actors. Unfortunately, we can't tell them apart. I've never managed to identify Paul McGann. The cinematography is downright bad. This picture is less fun than the others, but it's trying for something better, and once it gets rolling, it kicks. It just takes a damn long time to get there. I love the way the FOX theme slides into dissonance..."
1,Amazon needs to allow a 'ZERO star' rating,"Giving this movie 1 star is giving it more than it deserves. This movie is TERRIBLE. It has no story, unlikable characters, cheap sets and kills off two great characters saved in ALIENS. David Fincher has gone on to direct some quality movies (Seven, The Game) but I am sure he would rather forget this bomb. Save your money and save your time and watch something else."
1,Biggest disappointment of my life!,"After the tense thriller of Alien and the stroke-inducing terror of Aliens, Number Three totally bummed me out! It was like following up the world's two scariest rollercoasters with a ride on the ghost train featuring an old guy in a sheet yelling, ""Boo."" I didn't care about any of the characters, least of all Ripley, the dingy sets didn't make me scared, it just made me want to wash, and although the final set-piece was impressive, I was thorougly bored throughout. Resurrection restored my faith in the franchise a little, but I just couldn't get the bad taste outta my mouth."
4,very good movie,"For some reason alot of people hate this movie. I knowthat the first version didn't make much sense, but the thespecial edition does.Still a good movie though."
2,aliens 3,"the condition of the product was good but when watching it it skips,stops...gonna take to a place and hope they can fix it..."
3,Not the best of the trilogy,"Parts of it were like a capital 1 commercial, very cheesy. Looks like just a payday for Sigourney and crew."
5,Really nice one!!!,"I remember the first time i saw this movie, i tought it was the worst alien movie ever, but right now, a few years before i think it's a really good one, very diferent to the 2 first ones."
3,Dark film would have made a great end to the series...,"Now-film-great David Fincher made his directorial debut here in what should have been the last of the excellent sci-fi/horror series. The special effects here are fairly good, but the scares are lacking. What the movie succeeds in is giving us a great main character, the tortured soul of Ellen Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver, the only female who can successfully lead an action flick. While it's not the best in the series, it is a great ending to the awesome series that started out with a crew of a commercial spaceship getting slaughtered and (sort of) ends with the last survivor of that ship finding herself stuck in one more battle with the beast that destroyed her life. Ignore the terrible fourth."
4,"Satisfying, clever movie","Ok, so ""Alien 3"" was not as classic as ""Alien"" or as fun as ""Aliens"", but it was not as horrible as many people have claimed. It was a terrific conclusion to the Alien series. (I don't include Alien: Resurection to be part of the series because it was so pointless and stupid.) The plot moved along smoothy and the acting was great, especially Weaver who I feel did the most convincing job in the series. On a side note I thought it was a superb idea to give the alien dog-like physical characteristics since its host was a Rotweiler. The only things I didnt care for in this final chapter was how the scrip-writer cut out Newt and Hick's role. Im sure the two would have been more than glad to return to make Alien 3 if they were given the opportunity. Anyway, it was a wonderfully crafted movie just not fully up to par as the first two.P.S.- there is not a more satisfying, clever ending to a movie than this one."
1,Lousy movie!!,"""Alien 3"" is not nearly as good as ""Aliens,"" in fact, it is much worse. The problem is, the movie ran out of materials."
3,"Fools, all of you!","You morons that say this is ""the WORST movie EVER!"" are sad cases. Are you saying Ron Howard's the Grinch is better? Home Alone is better? Battlefield Earth is better? This movie isn't even bad. You're just mad cuz all the ""cool people"" from Aliens were killed off. Face it, it would've been weak if they lived. I wouldn't wanna see Hicks and Bishop and Newt being chased around the prison-planet.Anyway, I think Fincher created a very slick and stylish sequel. I appreciate it for what it is."
5,"Very confusing, but the most thrilling","Alien 3 is a great film, and I loved it. It is just, too confusing. When the super facehugger facehugged Ripley, it sent a queen embryo, but then it facehugged an ox, I thought Ripley already had the embryo inside, so It couldn't give another embryo. It is very thrilling, the beast-like alien."
1,Easily the worst of the series,"I am a big fan of the first two movies, and thats where it ends for me because the next two sequels were among the worst sequels in cinematic history. If Ed Wood had been put in the directors chair he would have done a better job. In my opinion it should never have been made. RUBBISH!"
2,Not a continued Excellence...,"With Alien and Aliens being such exemplary filmwork, it's hard to give this 3rd segment of the series kudos. The special effects was not given the attention that was heeded in the first 2 installments.That's unfortunate."
5,Alien 3,"This movie is alright. It is my least favorite in the whole series because it is very boring. And the alien looks kind of wierd when it moves. But the 2-disc collecter's edition was good. It had alot of special features in the second disc. On the first it mostly had just the theatrical version and the special version of the film. The special edition version of the film has 30 minutes of never-before-seen footage! And it also has a commentary. IT has good sound and very good picture. On the second disc it has tons of special features like Behind the scenes featurettes like Development, INCLuding the story, Creature designs, still photo galleries, storyboards, multi-angle study and a very cool teaser trailer of alien vs. predator.So if you are a fan of aliens this one is a good dvd for you.I SPENTED MORE THAN 2 HOURS AND 51 MINUTES WATCHING SPECIAL FEATUERS ON THIS 2-DISC DVD!"
2,"When good works fail, blame the director!","The director said he made this film for his friends. There are plenty struggling directors out there with greater abilities that could have been used. This is a commercial project and not a vehicle for showing-off to friends.When the warden says there are no aliens on his prison and gets immediately snatched up from above, it's so artificial that the whole scene becomes a waste of opportunities. An amatuer filmmaker knows you have to give the actors reaction time! Maybie Fincher is an amatuer in a job he can't handle.I didn't think his other movie Seven was very good. Fight club was good but I didn't like seeing buildings blown up then or even now."
3,This movie is not as bad as people say.,"People think this movie is one of the worst movies ever made. Well thats there opion. Sure there are some bad things about this movie but I still like it. Ripley's death was proably a good thing. Not that I'm saying Sigourney Weaver is a bad actress but it was time for her character to die. The rest of the characters in this movie were stupid. The one thing I didn't like is that they didn't explain why the alien was so different from all the others. I enjoyed the death scenes in this movie. They made them seem so dramatic. This is not the best movie, but I enjoyed it. If your an alien fan you'll have to see this one to make sense of 4."
3,"Worst of the series, but not all that bad","'Alien 3' is certainly not the 'Citizen Kane' of the 'Alien' movies, but it fares pretty well for its plot. I think that this film got so much bad press because the first two movies were so good, and by comparison, this was just plain lousy. I do have to admit that this is the worst one of the lot, but it isn't so bad that I can't watch it like all the other films. Also, DO NOT see this movie without seeing 'Alien Resurrection.'"
3,Out of place.,"Some people say that David Fincher is the wrong director for this movie. In many ways, he is. The Seven director's gloomy style gives the movie a dreadful feel but destroys any suspense or intensity. But in a way, Fincher saved this movie from being total Hollywood crap --- the material is definately second rate, but his unique style made the movie more original and fresh. Even though, before renting this movie keep in mind that it is closer to a Star Trek episode than either of its predecessors."
3,"Not Bad, but the weakest of the series to date.","After Ridley Scott and James Cameron had created two sci-fi classics in their own right, the limits of the Alien premise was all too apparent in the third installment. Although the special effects are excellent, the acting is great, with a skin headed Weaver delivering another extraordinary performance as Ripley, definately some shocks, a memorable final show down as well as moving ending, ""Seven"" director David Fincher was simply the the wrong man to direct it. His downbeat, gloomy style that was to work so well with his other films is out of place in the Alien genre and where as both Cameron and particularly Scott kept the tension on a knife edge once the creatures had made an appearence, Fincher lets it slack all to often. However its definately worth watching and does bring a more human approach to the series, even though it's a far cry from the two that went before."
2,disappointing,"While this movie may be a decent film in itself, it cannot even be compared to the others in the series. I am an extreme Aliens fan and I was very disappointed by this movie. The creature in this one is supposed to move and act differently (since this time it is born from an animal and thus has animal like qualities) but the computer generated parts are totally obvious and unrealistic. It also does not adhere to the story: aliens do not have eyes, so then why are there scenes shot as if seen through the eyes of the creature? I don't hate this because it lacks guns and marines and stuff like that, i hate it because it was carelessly thrown together. i think someone who had a truer passion for the story of the Alien should have been in charge of this one. But by contrast, the series is SAVED (yes, SAVED) by the 4th movie. Anyone who says the 4th one sucked is obviously not a true Aliens fan. sorry"
4,Much better than the crowd estimates,"Mystifies me why the intense, lovely gothic edge of this little film escaped most reviewers. Who needed more of the repetitive themes of the first two movies? This is literate, claustrophobic, creative--I mean it took guts and imagination to strand these characters without weapons against our familiar predator. My only complaint is that Charles Dance buys the farm way too soon. By contrast, Alien Resurrection is a complete piece of trash. Series should have signed off for good after this one"
3,Good but not great,The first and second aliens were AMAZING but this one was only okay. I thought that the new looking alien was cool but I did not like the writing and acting quite as much...very predictable as well. Other than that...I liked this movie. I suggest Alien and Aliens instead though.
4,Underrated,This is in my opinion the second best alien -movie in the series. Maybe it isn`t fincher at his best(note: this was his big-screen debut)but Alien 3 is still at least a strong portait of decay.
3,Not very good,"I don`t know why they made a third one. The first and second were masterpieces. This, is just plain wierd. This one is to violent and the violence takes away the chilling side of the movie. If they didn`t have all the violent scenes, this would be another alien masterpiece."
3,Disapointing but not as much as Resurrection!,"I find Alien 3 a lot more watchable than Alien Ressurrection. The bad thing about it is that it kills off all the interesting characters of the first 2 movies. Carrie Heine as Newt was adorable and her and Sigourney Weaver had great chemestry. Michael Biehn (Terminator) was great as a soldier named Hicks and Lance Henrikson was very good as an android. So what does Alien 3 do ? It kills them all off. Ripley arrives on a prison planet as the only survivor on her ship. An alien was also on board of course and guess what ? Ripley has one inside her. Another alien comes out of a dog to cause some havoc. There's no guns on the planet so they have to figure out how to kill it....and it takes them the whole movie to figure that out. If it wasn't for the cool set designs, good direction and good performances by Weaver and Charles Dutton the movie would've been a total waste. Hell it's still 100 times better than the last one though."
2,Shame !!!,"Okay, look. My brother and I have a personal grudge against this disapointment. First off, how in the heck did an alien get on board the SULACO ?Sigourney Weaver (aka Baldy in this one) didn't care to even preserve the characters who survived, so killing Hicks and Newt- poor Newt, so she can cash in on her pay.And the effects were not good. I could tell the alien effects were not generated well. Again, shame !!!"
4,work print is way better,"i have seen both versions of the film and I think the workprint is way better except one thing, how did the cow get an alien in it. in the theatrical it explains how the dog got the facehugger but in the work print you just all of a sudden get introduced to a dead cow who has the alien burst out of it. other than that the work print is way better deffinitly reccomended to any alien fan."
2,Alien 3 is a bad try at a remake of alien.,Sigourney Weaver once again reprises her role as Ripley this time a fire threatning the Sulaco her pod lands on a penal colony.When she land she finds that she the only survivor of this crasy and the planets inhabitants are every single know vermon in the face of the universe.But an Alien has been abord her ship the hole time this alien being more faster and keener then any before Ripley is once again chosen to her fate of fighting the creature once again.A lack luster script often dark but at times fallen short to a mediocre script with not much to go on however sigorney weaver is good in anything no matter weither it's bad or good the Dvd is not very imressive but picture quality is good and sound is even better but your best bet is to get Alien or Aliens.
1,Oh My God....,"What was the director of this movie thinking! There is only one word that i can describe this movie with. CRAP Plain and simple this movie sucks. Most of the great charactors from Aliens are killed of in the first 30 seconds of the movie. Ok well some people might be able to handle that. Then the film is bogged down by bad effects, stupid charactors, and dialog that wanted to make me puke. If that wern't bad enough the same face hugger manages to implant Ripley and a dog before dying off. I thought the face huggers only layed one egg before dying. Hmmmmmm... If you want to see some really great sci-fi movies rent Alien and Aliens. Even Alien Ressurection is better than this sloppy excuse for a movie. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
3,Potential for greatness lost,"This third installment in the popular Alien series gets close to greatness but doesnt quite make it. Alien 3 brings back the horror element of the series that was lacking a bit in Aliens, but in doing so we loose character development and a stable, tight, plot. The begining and ending of the film are brilliant and riviting, yet in the middle we have a seemingly endless blur of unknown people being conveniently wasted, to the point where it takes away the horrific edge. While a few moments of brilliance shine through (namely, Charles Dance's performance), its not till the very end that the plot kicks into high gear. And even then we are treated to one last barrage of bald unknowns being torn to pieces; (I dont see how it would have hurt the film to let a few more guys live). It is also most regrettable that the few characters that do become likable are killed off. The movie leaves me pondering how great it could have been, if only more time had been put into the writing."
3,Not really worth it,"This movie is OK. It isn't as good as the second film and definetly isn't as good as the first film.PROS: Nice atmosphere and suspense, pretty scary, great endingCONS: Bad script, bad alien effects, too profane, some bland actingBOTTOM LINE: It's OK. The third best in the series. A few slightly redeeming qualities that keep it from being the worst in the series."
4,A flawed yet underrated sequel,"I'm one of the few that actually enjoys Alien 3. It's not a perfect film by any means, but being a huge fan of the series, I will definitely say that it is pretty underrated. One of the things that annoys me, and the thing that is probably the films biggest flaw is that mysterious egg at the beginning.Other than that, it's a solid sequel from first time director David Fincher. The film does get pretty slow near the end but if you've seen the documentary done for the film, you already know it went through development hell, so those certain things are easier to overlook.As far as PQ for the Blu-ray, it's fantastic. The film has never looked better, and probably never will. There are some shots though that look a bit smudgy or less detailed but I would say 90% of it is very well detailed.Oh, and be sure to watch the Assembly Cut of Alien 3 if you haven't already. It's my preferred cut and is much more closer to Fincher's original vision."
5,Excellent; wish the series ended here,"I recently rented the first 3 installments in the 'Alien' series, and I'd just like to say that had the series ended this way, it would've been a masterpiece. Ripley dying at the end and then her transmission from 50 years earlier (a transmission she made at the end of the first 'Alien' movie) reaching the deserted prison--""with any luck, the network will pick me up...this is Ripley, last survivor of the Nostramo, signing off""--was the most depressing ending I've ever seen in a scifi/horror movie. I really wish the series had ended after Alien 3. This one is great, IMHO."
5,Alien3 is my second favorite Alien movie but it is great,"Alien3 has a very cleverly designed plot, which is one of the reasons why I like it. It has a very interesting cast and ends the trilogy (the first three movies) perfectly. If you have seen the first 2 movies, then don't hesitate to see it. All of the characters are endearable (including the alien). I can't tell who ever reads this the plot, only because it would give it all away. The thing I like about the trilogy is that each movie picks up where the predecessor left off. I haven't seen the DVD version, but either format, it is a kick-a** movie, and I seriously reccomend it."
2,beating a dead calf,"Directed by David Fincher, ""Alien 3"" is . . . well, let's face it . . . pitiful. Not even thrilling, it can't even compare to the pair of semi-classics which followed before it. The story is weak, the acting bland, the special effects so-average-it's-not-funny, and the entire idea is just dumb. After two great predecessors, what do you expect? Okay, maybe sequels are good, but after that? You have nothing."
3,ALIEN 3!,"""Aliens"" was my favorite film in the series, so when they kill off Newt and Hicks in the opening credtis fo this one, I was very, very, very, ticked off! So Ripley is now stranded on a penal colony, convinced the big bad aliens are about to start killing everyone! The second-half of the film manages to redeem itself somewhat when we find out why the aliens have spared Ripley! David Fincher's 1992 film is certainly the weakest film in the (so far) four films, although Signourney Weaver struggles valiantly with the script's shortcomings!"
4,Very underrated movie.,"The first time I saw this flick in the cinema I was furious with the errors they made in the script. There was never any explanation how one facehugger could impregnate Ripley as well as the dog on Fury 161, there was no explanation as to why this alien is different from all other aliens. How could Ripley ever get impregnated if her cryotube is still intact. But when viewing it again and again and again, I realised that if you look through these errors, you end up with a pretty decent horror movie.The good thing about this movie is the way Ripley changes again into a new being without hope, but with a lot of acceptance of her new role in the universe.I however feel this movie could have been done a lot better."
5,Ripley's nightmare is more terrifying than Aliens.,"Ripley crash lands on a prison planet, and her companions Nuet and Bishop are dead, Ripley is nursed back to health by one of the prisoners. And has her hair shaven. Ripley has no weapons, when the alien shows up in the prison facility, killing off the prisoners, With no weapons, Will Ripley survive?"
3,One of the worst in the series unless you watch the directors cut,Alien is the worst in the series because of the studio. David Fincehr had a dark film in his mind but the studio cut it down. The film does have a few good scares and the cinematography is cool. But the film is very slowly paced and most viewers won't be able to take it.
2,"Grate chances, Horrible resault.","This movie is the second worst in the series, the ending of alien 2 offered so many grate chances to make a good alien 3 sequal. But David Fincher had to make it a boaring, depressing movie like he allways does with all his films.I do think alien resurrection is worse becouse the guys who made that movie had no idea what the alien ""Spirit"" was about and made a movie that looked nothing like an alien movie too me. I think fincher did a little better then that, but not much better."
1,Horrible.,"Horrible is the word I would use to summarize this film in one word. This is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. The only reason anyone would see this movie is to keep up with the series. However, you are not missing anything by not watching it. The film is way too dark and, not to mention, it is not entertaining at all. Director David Fincher's style does not fit the Alien series at all."
2,Not very good,"I agree that they shouldve stopped at two if they were going to just kill off everyone. They went through this incredible odyssey in Alien and Aliens, especially in the latter where Ripley does everything to save Newt and what happens? She dies right away shortly after going to sleep on the way home. Nice. That ruined it for me right there. The rest of the movie, although it does have some nice alien moments, is actually poorly acted and boring. And how is it that Ripley had such a long gestation period? Didnt Kane in the first one have a relatively short one and it happened shortly after he became conscious? This movie almost made me not like Alien and Aliens it was such a disrespectful movie. There are tons of ideas for an alien movie. This one was the wrong one in just about every way."
2,Should've stopped at Aliens,"This is the perfect case of film companies wanting to squeeze out a little more money in a series no matter how bad the movie turns out. Alien 1 & 2 were great films, even watching them now years later I'm still on the edge of my seat.I bought the big Alien DVD set and sat down to watch 3 last night for the first time, and I couldn't even finish it, it was just bad, terrible, stupid. The Alien name aside, this was a poorly done movie from all angles. Nothing made sense, it was goofy, acting was terrible (except for Sigourney and the doctor), and it wasn't the least bit scary."
1,Worthy of scorn,"The other reviewers here are right. Alien 3 was just beyond the abilities of the crew. The writing was poor. The CGI laughable. Alas, if I were the director, I would merely cut all the scenes with CGI and immediately get a better movie. The first two (Alien and Aliens) are great in Blu-Ray; just skip this one."
1,Skip it.,"Aliens was the perfect conclusion, but this ruins it. Bad effects, plot, and etc make a bad film. It only deserves one star for Sigourney Weaver and thats it.P.S. Stay away from the fourth at all costs unless you are either a diehard fan of this series, Sigourney Weaver, or C.G.I. exploitation."
2,If only it had been more of the same...,"The first two entries in the Alien world were beautifully crafted, cohesive, actually believable stories, and I have only good things to say about them. Three was an awful disappointment, but based on the absurd premises, uncommitted direction and writing, and general ham-handling of it, the result was perhaps the best we could hope for. It's a lot of gray, yellow and black motion brought to you by a director who should have known better than to tell a two-hour story with Nike-ad blur-and-flash action shots."
2,Worst of the series.,The main bad thing in the movie itself is definately the swearing.The story is so bad because it kills off everything James Cameron did in Aliens.They kill Hicks and the little girl and Bishop ends up in dump.Another thing is how cheesy some of the dialog is.Also how in the heck did an alien survive from the second film?The queen could'nt have layed eggs because her tail was shot off and that is where the eggs are produced so this movie doesn't make to much sense.A sad addition to the great sci-fi series.
2,It had potential. . .but. . .,"Probably the most frustrating thing about this movie was the fact that it had so much potential. It had such a terrific setup from the previous film. There were so many great paths they could have taken the story at the conclusiion of ""Aliens"" that it is hard to figure out where they took such a bad turn with Alien 3. There are very few characters that one can sympathize with since it takes place on a prison planet filled with rapists and murderers. Sigourney Weaver tries to work with a particularly lackluster script and story. If it weren't for her sincerity and history with the creatures, the movie would have been a complete disaster. The end of the film is also disappointing, giving us a particularly depressing conclusion to the trilogy. Several years later, I was excited to see ""Alien: Resurrection,"" but it was even more disappointing than this was. If you want the true ""Alien"" experience, you can't go wrong with the first two films."
3,"Alien 3, for better or for worse?","Sigourney Weaver returns yet again in this funky piece called Alien 3. I personally saw at my friends house during a sleep over. Warning: If you haven't seen Alien or Aliens, don't see this, it wont make any sense! Now for someone who has seen Alien and Aliens this movie has a lot of swears. And I don't mind swears, but this movie has A LOT OF SWEARS. Not for the little children either! If you have a surround sound system this would be good, and it's in Widescreen. I think this movie is good for a dark night where you want to scare your friends.If you liked Aliens (the 2nd one) you may or may not like this movie. The surviving characters from the secound one die except for Ripley (Of course!) An okay movie with a few surprises (actually a lot)and a lot of swears."
3,.,"It has the definite, captivating style of David Fincher, no question about that, and there really isn't anything all *that* bad about the movie in and of itself, but really, I can't help but say it never should've been made. Alien. Aliens. Alien 3? Mm. It's just bad ... if they *had* to do it, they should've done something new with it. I was tired of Sigourney Weaver's ""bitch"" character by the time I saw this ... getting to be more of a caricture than a character, really. So ... not bad, but ... there are more worthwhile things that could've been given life in its place."
3,alien 3,alien 3 is alright and a good sequel.but i still think it all ends at ALIENS.since there are no more facehuggers!!!!
3,"So much better than ""Aliens""","This doesn't get so boring as ""Aliens"", so it's actually fun to watch. And I really liked the return of Bishop (even if this wasn't the ""Real one""). Some of the death scenes were great, and it also gave me a few good scares. I could write a lot more about this movie, but it's not so much more to say. It's a standard movie about evil Aliens, and mankind's attempt to save themselves and our planet."
3,Alien 3 gets 3 stars,"Uneven episode in the ALIEN saga and perhaps the worst. However the accting is okay and the film is alright, but it seems far too dull and will prove dissapointing and boring for some."
3,Okay flick.,"This movie is disappointing because the first two were so good. Its eerie atmosphere is very effective and its bizarre plot gives it a blade-runnerish sort of feel. Sigourney Weaver is getting a bit long in the tooth. She should have been written out of the series after the second flick. Still, the movie is better than average for sci-fi. Anyone seen Independence Day?"
2,Disappointing.,"ALIEN was great. ALIENS was an all time masterpiece. And ALIEN3 is...well, not as bad as everyone says. On the good side, we have a great opening sequence, some great effects (a few dodgy ones though), a very good musical score and some very good performances. On the bad side, there's...well, it's inexplicable. Something about this movie just fails to live up to the other two. There's too much gore and too much talk (like ALIEN in that respect), and simply not enough action! Blood-and-guts fans will have little to complain about, and it does have some of the suspense that made ALIEN so popular. But on the whole, ALIEN3 is one of the weakest Alien films - unless you count the latest nail in the Alien coffin, ALIEN RESURRECTION..."
2,"Alien 3--Bad movie, OK DVD","Now, after viewing the DVD powerhouses, Alien and Aliens, I felt let down that Fox returned to thier basic DVD foundation. Only one trailer and a ""Making of"" feature. Boring :( This film is not that great to begin with, so Fox, try to add some cool features to make it cool. A commentary would have been cool or deleted scenes. I know of several deleted scenes(about 15 minutes of footage) available out in the video market. Come on Fox, try a little, you were doing so well with the first two Alien films. Oh well."
2,COULD'VE BEEN BETTER!!!!1,"When we last left Ripley, she tangooed with a queen alien which she blew out the air lock. Feeling coffident she killed all the aliens once and for all, Ripley goes into hypersleep with the lone survivors of the mission. It ain't long before she wakes up on an unknown planet, and more aliens are afoot!!! This is my least favorite of the alien series. Scifi/horror fans put this one aside."
3,The weak link...,"Alien 3 is the weak link in one of the most amazing series of films ever. After James Cameron went to all the trouble of having Newt and Hicks narrowly cheat death in Aliens, why must they die in the opening minutes of the next film? It somehow lessens the experience of Aliens to watch it knowing what happens next. A3 lacks the heart pounding suspense of its predecesors and ultimately leaves the viewer with a dissapointed and drained feeling. On the plus side the imagary is great and as in each of the Alien movies the director (in this case David Fincher) succeeds in taking the series in a fresh and interesting direction."
3,Sigourney is better than the material,"Alien was a great horror film. Aliens was a great action film. Alien 3 is just an okay film. Ripley is a great character and the one that Sigourney Weaver will be always remembered. But this round the plot felt like it was already outdated. The one thing is Weaver knows Ripley better than the writer and makes the character three dimensional. Unfortunately, that is the only thing in this film that is three dimentional.If you liked Alien and Aliens, you probably will want this to get this film and Alien Resurection to have the entire set. But as a stand alone, pass on this and go for one of the first two."
3,"Good Stand-Alone Movie, Not A Great Sequel","This would have been a good stand-alone movie, but isn't a worthy sequel to the excellent ""Aliens"". There are too many plot twists and suppositions that aren't believable from the ending of ""Aliens"". For example, how could Ripley have been impregnated inside the ship when the queen Alien was never inside the ship?Getting back to the suspense and thrill similar to the first film is one of the redeeming qualities to this film. There are several instances of genuine fear in the film. The cinematography is very good, and adds to the ""spookiness"" of the film. The alien looks a bit different than in the first two films, also.I don't think this is a worthy sequel to the two top-notch films that preceded it."
2,They Shoulda' Stopped at Two,"The original Alien and its sequel Aliens are true classics of the genre. Different movies in almost every way, but equally superior film making. Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection are sorry excuses for sequels. They're classic examples of Hollywood greed. Bad stories wrapped in excellent SFX don't make memorable movies. Alien and Aliens should be at or near the top of your ""Must Have"" sci-fi/horror/action DVD list. Aliens 3 and Alien Resurrection...well, something has to be at the bottom o' the heap."
3,Alien 3,"Pre-Fight Club David Fincher directed this misunderstood entry into the Alien franchise. While it's a flawed film, it does touch on some themes that weren't done in the first two, and there are some effectively creepy moments.The special effects quota reverts back to the original's modus operandi of not showing the aliens as much as James Cameron's ""everything and the kitchen sink"" trademark. Which is rather effective and creepy, utilising the old ""hiding in the shadows"" trick. And Sigourney Weaver is good as the tough-as- nails Ellen Ripley. Still, it's disappointing compared to the first two films, because the action is subdued, the characters are cardboard and the plot is very silly. But there is some good action, and while the nihilistic ending would have seemed to rule out the possibility of a fourth entry, Alien Resurrection carried on the story to bigger, and arguably better effect."
1,What It was Missing,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSPut aside the fact that Newt, Hicks, and Bishop did not survive. Put aside the fact that Ripley miraculously ends up with criminals at a prison. Put aside Ripley being impregnated somehow with a queen and committing suicide by falling into lava. Put aside all the silly, idiotic stuff in the script. What the first two movies had that this one horribly lacked was tension. It had gore and grossness, but without the tension, it was as scary as trick-or-treaters on Halloween night.I loved Alien. I really enjoyed Aliens. After having seen this one, I just choose to ignore it altogether as though it never happened."
4,Special Edition provides vindication...,"Apparently like so many others, I was somewhat disappointed with the theatrical release of Alien3. But this Special Edition, which provides us with the much needed footage that was forcibly cut from the film, is both enlightening and entertaining.Alien3 differs from its classic predecessors because it does not focus on the monster, but instead concentrates on the human journey. Like the prior two films, with the restored footage it is indeed a visual feast.I don't want to spoil the details for you, and prior reviewers here have already done an excellent job, so I'll just conclude by saying that Director Fincher has been vindicated with the release of this Special Edition. Alien3 is one of those rare films that actually becomes more appreciated as time marches on.Go ahead, and give this film a second chance by viewing this Special Edition - it's well worth your time and effort."
3,Good movie,"My 3rd favorite of the original trilogy . Still good if you like the franchise, and has more punch than the recent additions."
3,not my favorite,"1 and 2 are SO good. 3 is kind of a let down. It was like they were all excited to use new technology that made the movie worse, not better."
4,Decent flick I guess.,I really like the Alien series alot and wanted to see this because its been a while. Still a great movie but lacks the intensity and tension that made Aliens so good.
4,good,"A good book that explains all that a patient needs to know about sexual impotence and nothing more. A book that is directly aimed at the target audience and offers nothing more then the minimum amount of information about impotence. For a much more improved book with lots of info on impotence and other sexual disorders look for"" Volume II - Natural Penis Enlargement: New methods of avoiding and curing impotence, premature ejaculation, and erectile dysfunction safely and inexpensively. ... Book on CD-Rom for PC & Mac Computers"" by Platinum Millennium"
3,I got the manga but,When I got my package I got my manga but the manga did not come in the box and I did not get a Chi figure. I demand an explanation.
4,"great music, okay game","The game itself is charming, but very clunky and difficult. The soundtrack was done by the famous ""Bo"", who only composed for a few games (including the very similar Space Harrier II) before moving on. Those of us who collect games for the music couldn't be happier with it, but just a warning to everyone else: the game itself is kinda mediocre."
2,A tough one....,"For me, sometimes the Cross novels become a bit too graphic with the violence, other times as in this one, even my imagination couldnt' diffuse the graphic images in my brain, I found it tough to read."
1,The Big Bad Wolf,This is not a book that James Patterson is capable of. Extremely disappointed. It seems to go on and on just babbling on inconsequential matters. I lost sight of characters and plot.
3,Okay story,"The Big Bad Wolf is a story to be read for the continuity of the series. Not the most outstanding story, but not the worst. The two-part nature of Big Bad Wolf and London Bridges is frustrating. You must read London Bridges to resolve the Wolf storyline."
3,Alright,"Far from his best work but I enjoyed the book. The thought that someone would sell another into slavery pissed me off enough to make me more intreseted in the book then I otherwise would have been. Though, the suprising plot line that pissed me off was the Little Alex story. The thought that that woman comes back to destroy a happily united family really threw me. I mean its one thing if she wanted to share custody but she doesnt she wants to take him back to Seattle with her. What a weak and conniving woman! I really hope Alex gets to keep his son. The fact that the Alex Cross series has now been diverted to ""Baby Momma Drama"" is ridiculous. I wish Christine would have stayed far away where she belonged."
3,Alex Cross Seems to be Losing Steam,"I love the Alex Cross character, but in this book, he seems to be losing ground - or is not as interesting as he once was. I see this happening with more and more bestselling authors - their work goes from excellent to mundane at best. Come on, Mr. Patterson, give us the old Alex Cross. The plot was good, but it's been done before."
4,Great in Audio,Big Bad Wolf unabridged was great. Thanks to production and performance. It made a slow book move.
4,Big Bad Russian,"James Patterson continues the Alex Cross saga in this thriller. I think Patterson does a great job of drawing the reader into the mysterious and frightening world of the Red Mafia, which I hope he'll discuss in more detail in the next book. I couldn't help but feel, though, that he failed to ""connect the dots"" and provide adequate transitions between parts of the storyline - especially towards the end. It's almost as if certain chapters were deliberately inserted to fill unintended gaps. Overall however, the novel holds true. It's a fine example of Patterson's work, which is unquestionably amongst the best of our day."
3,Just Okay-It didn't excite me much!,"The Big Bad Wolf was a little disappointing to me. I felt like it needed to be more thrilling, and it just didn't quite make it.There's a diabolical killer on the loose. And linked to him is a ""Couple,"" that buys and sells men and women for ransom. The first character abducted in the story is Liz Connolly, an wealthy woman who is held hostage by the Wolf. Others are picked up and held, some of them killed, while others survive.Alex Cross is trying to get the killer to communicate with him so he and his FBI pals can nail him good. But within the book, this is disappointing, as they never seem to get the right person doing the killing-very strange.Alex is having problems on the homefront along with all else. His ex-girlfriend, Christine, who is little Alex's mom wants custody of him all of a sudden without warning. And she is hiring a lawyer to do the dirty work.The book was good enough to see what was going to happen next, but not Patterson's best."
1,Patterson's Worst Yet...ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"A dozer. This book is lackluster; severely lacking in both character and story development. Seems to me that Patterson has decided to rest on his laurels and churn out drivel for his fans. My advice: don't waste your money on this. If you want to read it, check it out from your local library...then you won't feel so ripped off.For other reviewers--please resist revealing the ENTIRE plot in your reviews. Sheesh, it would be nice to have at least ONE surprise left while reading. (Although in this particular book there's not much ""plot"" to reveal.)"
5,"I like this writer a lot,","The Big Bad Wolf, by James Patterson, is a fast-pace, action-packed, interesting story, that had me eagerly turning the pages."
1,My First and Last Patterson Novel,"What a disappointing book. I kept reading just to find out what happens, but the book ends without an ending.The various popular culture references come across as clumsy attempts to hook the reader. Very little character development. No real resolution of the major problems raised. Plenty of disturbing descriptions of creepy extreme BSDM people in action.All in all not worth the time to read. I guess that popular modern fiction writers can get away with cranking out drivel and still take the money to the bank. Don't let it be your money!"
3,Warning - this book doesn't end!!! Wait for the sequel.,"Big Bad Wolf leaves you, as another reviewer said, ""wanting his next book right away."" That's because Patterson doesn't end this one. I've read all of Patterson's books and with the exception of the ""Thomas Berryman Number,"" and ""The Jester,"" they've all been at least decent, and in most cases, damned good. I don't remember Patterson ever ending a book like this before. I don't mind cliffhangers on TV when I know I can probably find out the ending next week. But when someone eagerly anticipates an author's next book, they deserve more than this. ""Big Bad Wolf"" feels rushed, like Patterson was on deadline to get it out and the editor didn't want to wait for re-writes. Come on JP! Your fans deserve better!!"
1,"Love Alex and it's a good read, BUT...","I think Patterson must be getting a wee bit greedy. This book was left totally unresolved on two major fronts. You're not getting me to buy another one, Mr. Patterson - your next book, I'll be checking out from the library! Other than a complete lack of resolution, it was a good, very fast read, but SO not worth almost $30! I'm force fed reality tv if I want to watch network tv (which I don't, since it's mostly moron tv, if you ask me); I will not stand for it in a book in which I want to escape. I realize many things in ""real life"" are not neatly wrapped up, like they USUALLY are in books, but this was ridiculous. It's like Patterson NEEDS us to buy the next book to find out what happens next. Thank goodness for JK Rowling, who I'm going back to next!"
4,"Fast moving, gripping entertainment","I thought this novel would be a good in-between read. Usually, I select what I believe to be challenging novels, scholarly fiction.How I enjoyed this suspenseful tale! Alex Cross is a realistic, dynamic protagonist with a personal life, children and a past to resolve. He is also a student, a new FBI agent who hasn't learned the ins and outs of the bureaucracy. Cross is pulled out of class to hunt down and entrap an international godfather of the Red Mafiya, the Wolf.The Wolf snatches and delivers beautiful women, and men, from shopping malls and college campuses to be delivered to psychopathic members of a secure internet chat service. Cross has to find these innocent, tortured victims before they are murdered by their captors.This book caused me to lose sleep many-a-night because I couldn't put it down. This is my first Patterson novel and I guarantee it won't be my last."
2,Cross is a stereotype of himself,"The Alex Cross novels, much like Robert B Parker's ""Spenser"" stories, is a victim Patterson's own success. The series starts well, but as the novels are pumped out, the bad guys become bigger, while our hero becomes more heroic. As noted by another reviewer, the chapters are a paltry page and a half long. This gives the illusion of a ""real page turner"" but what it truly does is waste paper. The other ""pager turner"" device deployed is ending most chapters with a lingering question or an exclamation, complete with italics. Without those, the story doesn't move well. The basic plot is fine. The coincidences and the happenstances (a 13 year old hacker comes to the rescue) are not imaginative. The internal struggles of Dr. Cross are forced. While there are action sequences, complete with gunfire, I never sensed that Dr. Cross was in danger. I only read the Cross stories out of habit at this point, but much like the Spenser novels, the early books are the best."
4,Great Pulp Fiction,"Patterson's books have all the attributes of the best pulp fiction: grisly murder, rape, tension, and a flawed but intriguing lead character. The villian, Wolf, is believable and genuinely unlikeable; the crime of human slavery is worthy of a bestseller and Patterson treats it with respect. The plot moves quickly and there's no need for a second reading--it's pretty linear and not hard to keep up. This isn't a slam, by the way. A good, fast-paced novel is a rare find and probably hard to write. But oh, so easy to read!"
1,What a Waste,"of time and money!! I surely will not even be tempted to buy his next--he doesn't get better, he gets worse! I'd bet the reading level is maybe--4th grade."
2,Missing about 100 pages,"As someone else said, Patterson just missed with this book. Another unsatisfying ending, with the bad guy not getting ""his,"" and the good guy getting the shaft. Needed another hundred pages or so to bring a few of those strings to a good ending. Probably going to be a ""Bigger, Badder Wolf"" in the future. Hope it ends better."
3,Big Bad Ending!,"I'm an avid fan of Patterson and Cross, but when I finished this one I immediately checked Amazon to see if the ""sequel"" was available yet so that I could read the ending. The Wolf was a scary villain but I was disappointed in the lack of character development of his ""accomplices"" and the victims. I'd given previous ""Cross"" books 5 stars, so I WILL continue to buy Patterson's books!"
4,Patterson keeps readers turning the pages,"Big Bad Wolf is the second Alex Cross novel that I've read from Patterson. Hence, my point of reference is not the same as that of long-time Patterson readers, many of whom speak disparagingly of his latest effort. From my perspective, the Big Bad Wolf had the makings of a good detective novel - an evil antagonist, a growing list of unsolved abductions, and a cerebral detective who remains relentlessly in pursuit. For me, the pages went quickly. Nothing in this book will keep me from picking up future works (and continuing to go back to earlier efforts that I have not yet read."
1,Time for a break from writing?,"This book offended me more than anything else. I love James Patterson books, but these last 2 Lake House and Big Bad Wolf were awful. I will never buy another James Patterson book. I might check one out from the library but I will never spend a dime on one.He seems like he's doing a job he hates by writing this lastest piece of trash.I think he needs to take a break, breathe and come back and write the way he did in Kiss the girls.Do not waste your money on this book. I read it in 3 hours and was pissed off the rest of the day that I spent 20.00 on the book."
2,Not that great.,"This was the first Patterson book I read. I liked some of it but this guy has a real problem writing women and children. A lot of what he writes is just plain dumb. Nana Mamma?!?! Pu-leeze. That's so stupid! How many times can he mention ""Zamochit?"" Just when things start to get good he STOPS writing. Like he doesn;t have the guts to write about what evil people do to their victims. Get real. Mr. Patterson has good ideas but poor writing skills."
1,so disappointed!,"I, like so many other James Patterson/Alex Cross fans, was anxiously awaiting this book, the next chapter in the life and career of Alex Cross. I was so disappointed in the lack of development of this book! It had a weak premise, the characters lacked development, the actual ""dirty deeds"" were not even entertaining much less interesting, and even the personal story line of our favorite detective was, again, under developed. It was almost as if James Patterson had a ghost writer who just didn't get the personality of the key players nor the angle of suspense that Patterson himself has been known to deliver. I can't imagine anticipating the sequel. I know that as a loyal fan I will probably read it, if for no other reason than to hope that the return of the core Cross family will be more developed and realistic than in this book, but I look forward to the book after that when this story can be put to rest and, hopefully, the true James Patterson will again emerge."
1,What a waste of time,"I guess the last book I read with Alex Cross as the lead character was Kiss the Girls. That had some believability, this one is nonsense. How can a well know author put his name on such trash!! Don't waste your time on this one."
4,Good Fast Read,The novel moves at a quick pace with alot of action.It not thought provoking but its definitely a FUN read.
3,Historic Haunted America,I enjoyed a book with chills and sapence and this was the book. It talks about people moving in to old haunted houses which they notice different things happening. They feel the ghosts of the past of these people who lived in these houses through-out America. Watch-out because peoples animals will stair up at the ceiliing. During these stories it tells about the history and a story abuot these people who now are ghost. You better watch-out were you move to and better asked the people about strange voices you may hear.I would rate this book 3 stars because of the quality and what goes on during the story. But over-all the book is pretty good.
5,"I Love the Big Bad Wolf, but I also fear him!","James Patterson has yet to let me down! I listened to the audio cd version and credit should also be given to the narrators/readers. Peter J. Fernandez is wonderful as the voice of Alex Cross, but my heart skipped a beat every time I would hear Denis O'Hara as the Wolf. I was surprised by the twists and turns of the story. Just when I thought they had caught the Wolf, some wicked twist completely threw me off track. The ending leads no doubt in my mind that we have NOT seen the last of the Wolf and I can not wait until the next novel."
1,What A Waste Of Time,"James Patterson used to write good novels. Then he becamefamous and now he forgot how to use the basics of writing.A good lead in, story and character development and anending that is suspenseful and COMES TO A CONCLUSION.The ending in this book reads like his agent phones himand tells him the proof copy is due at the publishersin thiry minutes, so get it wrapped up!He brings in characters that are never explained, endsthe book without telling what happens to some of theleads and has no ending--seems he is just setting upanother book to be over-hyped again!We are done with Patterson at our house--waste of timeand money--same as happened to Patricia Cornwell.Bring on more new writers like Dan Brown and Brian Haig!B"
1,"Once again, no ending","It seems that James Patterson either has a page quota or a book quota. When he hits the page quota he stops writing, left out the ending or he has a book quota and wants to sell twice to the suckers who would like to find out the ending.Shame on me for continuing to buy his books when so many of his recent efforts have been so unsatisfying.Stick to the early works which were outstanding."
1,"Badly written, poor plot development, ridiculous subplots.","I honestly wouldn't waste your money on this one. The plot is weak and really badly developed, the characters are wooden and two-dimensional and the writing simple and boring.Even if you can overlook all these things, the ridiculously emotional language that is used to try and inject some interest into Cross's family life is so bad that you will end up sniggering or gagging through most of the book.This really does not deserve to be published."
1,A disappointed Patterson fan,"I am a huge fan of James Patterson, and after reading this book I vowed never to buy another of his novels! The story is all too familiar, too similar to his other plots; it is simplistic and the twists are foreseeable The ending had me enraged. Please do not waste your money or time on this book!!"
3,Story Line,"I have read over 6 of the Alex Cross series and have enjoyed them. However, I am really getting tired of hearing about his family and his sex life. He will spend 2 chapters or more just on this which takes away from the main story. To me it seems like he needed filler for the book. Just stick to the story. I have yet found a reliable source to tell me the exact order of the series. One minute Kyle Craig is in prison and the next he is Alex's boss. Very confusing."
3,Cross books have reached the MEDIOCRE level and seems to be stuck there............,"ok after Roses are REd..or maybe after JACK and JILL....the Cross series havent been able to pick up the magic, the mometum of its previous novels........VIOLETS are BLUE was the WORST book in the series.............GOD what was Patterson thinking??????since then Thankfully the books havent been as BAD as VIOLETS......but still its seems to be stuck in the mediocre level........2.5 has been my rating for the previous Patterson books.......i hope it gets better now...........but from what i have heard...........its supposed to get even worse............"
3,Basic but vicious,"You have try to understand what Patterson is doing. He isn't attempting ""great writing."" It's suspense fiction, and is supposed to use a direct and powerful style. If the style was more elaboate it would get in the way of the plot. Having said that, this isn't his best book. The Wolf is an intersting character or could have been if more developed. But the premise of someone abducting sexy women to be used as sexual entertainment has been done so many times, it isn't an orginal plot. It does have the usual Patterson intensity, though, so many people will find it exciting. His novels are sort of dreamlike and he said they aren't meant to be taken seriously as reality driven stories. Just a more violent version of a cartoon, or maybe a puppet show. Anyway, careful on your way to grandmother's house, because there are a lot of Big Bag Wolves in the wolrd, and one will surely bite you some day."
3,The Ending a Bit of a Let Down,"This is my first James Patterson book. Yes my first, and contrary to what some of the other readers expressed, I did enjoyed this book. I had the feeling that I may be out sequence with Alex Cross's adventures, but this story kept on track and I wasn't lost with the character. I enjoy being educated when I read a novel and Mr. Patterson did an excellent job of the Russian mob or whatever they are called. The Wolf fella was a bit over done. There were lots of plot twists and interweaving of story lines. The only real problem I had was the ending was a bit of let down. I got the feeling that the writer just ran out of steam."
3,An O.K Page turner,"i really wanted to like this bookYou know I am not a whimp when it comes to reading books based on adult subjects. I like parts of this book but what seemed to happen is that whenever I stated to really get into a section one of three things would happenTortureRapeRandom violenceI really got mad at this book, O.K we get it the title is ""Big Bad Wolf"" meaning the big bad mafia guy can do basically whatever he wants. The author(or the publisher maybe?) isn't just happy with that, no they have to give glaring examples as to HOW ""The Big Bad Wolf"" gets what he wants.Overall-The same stuff page after page I put it down about halfway through"
1,Disappointing,"Wow! I have read most of Patterson's books, including the Alex Cross group. This is the only one that thoroughly disappointed me. The plot was all over the place and the ending..... Well for the most part, there wasn't one. Confusing and sad. Sure hope the next book saves this dismal story. I have not talked to anyone who enjoyed this book. Everyone is allowed one mistake. Mr. Patterson, I hope this is yours."
1,Erg ...,"Well if Four Blind Mice was bad -- The Big Bad Wolf is pure trash. I've read all the Cross novels, but in this one, I didn't care if he lived or died or found love or treated his kids how they should be treated. He wasn't a character, he was a name on the paper. I cared about nobody in the book. And nothing ever really seemed to happen ... I thought it was just a slow start, and perhaps it still is (since the book is set up to have a sequel). If you're an Alex Cross fan, read it because of that reason -- but do not expect it to be an Alex Cross novel."
1,"Good at first, but majorly disappointing over all","This book started off so well-- i couldn't put it down and couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. Without giving anything away, I would just like to say that the ending was a HUGE disappointment and I felt as if nothing was ever solved. It just ended. Nothing was believable, you have no idea why the things that happened were happening and so many other story lines are left totally unsolved. I am so frustrated with this novel that i had to write a review :("
1,Where Is The Outrage?,"At a time when legitimate talents of the genre only make the best seller lists for a few weeks, hack work by Patterson just keep hanging on. First off, forget the Publishers Weekly review (have you ever read a bad review by these shills?). The characters are styrofoam. The plotting is pedestrian. The author continues to reveal himself as a woman-hater in his fiction. If you want great suspense, go for Harlan Coben. If you want clever writing, try Robert Parker. But please, save yourself the time and the money. Skip this piece of nonsense."
3,Come On James!,You know you just threw this book together. I am a devoted fan of all the Alex Cross stories and I was disappointed because you can do better than this. The story happened at the end of the book and then it was over. You get one pass. Come correct next time. Peace
2,Falling Out of Favor,"One of my favorite characters is Alex Cross and I can't wait until Patterson pens a new adventure. I still like his style of writing but when I finished this one I was ready to throw it out the window!! A huge disappointment! James, go back to writing the love stories - Suzannah's Diary was sooo much better."
1,Patterson has now become a B author !,"Maybe success has now shifted him to crank out more books for a revenue stream.His latest book ""The big bad wolf"" is a mishmash of sub plots that seem to have had no logical order for in depth thrillers.After his last Alex Cross bomb (Four blind mice) has now reached the nadir of hack writing. Seems that he has done to Alex Cross,what hollywood has done to ""Jaws"", sequil it to Ad nauseum.I would now rather wait for a yearly publication of a Daniel Silva work than a bimonthly offering from patterson!"
1,Thank goodness I did not pay for this book!,"What has happened to James Patterson? The PR, on this book, professed that it was going to be the best Alex Cross story, yet. ....it wasn't! I guess it serves me right for paying attention to PR! I didn't understand why the inclusion of the custody suit was handled the way it was...was this supposed to satisfy readers who want more of the detective's personal life included in the story? The ending is one of Mr. Patterson's well known tricks for supposedly making you want to buy his next book....I won't even borrow that one, the way I did this one. James Patterson is capable of writing really well....I wish he would try doing it, again. (Alone, without a co-author!)"
1,What a joke!!!,"I'm a Patterson fan but was thoroughly disappointed with this book. Who is the Wolf? Who is the FBI mole? Who is Marvel? Was the sniper after Alex? How did Alex know the Wolf was shooting at Lipton? There were so many things unexplained that I felt like I wasted hours in reading this book. Alex was billed as a long wolf himself but he never went after the Wolf by himself. I was getting worried when I was running out of pages with no ending in sight. Sure enough, the pages ran out and what a stupid ending. Chapter 116 through Epilogue needs to be rewritten. What a joke!!!"
2,Where's the ending?,"Hmmm, I wonder if Mr. Patterson plans to write a follow up to this novel? Could he have left more things unresolved? The Wolf, the sniper, little Alex, his new love interest, and those are just the ones I remember. The book was entertaining, but I felt mislead. I don't have a problem with leaving a small opening for sequels, but what he has done here is written half a novel. I can only assume ""Big Bad Wolf II"" is around the corner."
3,Good for a long flight,"The Big Bad Wolf by James Patterson contains many of the same elements that law-enforcement thrillers frequently include; a brilliant protagonist with a tragic past, a few equally brilliant collaborators, a very bad bad-guy, resistance from within the ""system,"" and well-intentioned but incompetent coworkers. A prolific writer, Patterson's subject matter for this novel, the sexual slave trade, has a high squeamish index. Recent newspaper articles highlighting the enormity of the global slave trade, (estimates put the number at over 1 million women and children) and the proliferation of Internet porn site, (now estimated at 1.3 million sites) make this a timely, if unsettling subject matter. It will get you half-way to San Francisco."
4,Page Burner for Cross Fans,"Alex Cross outdoes himself as the FNG at the FBI. Disdaining the bureacracy of the fibbies, he uses his street smarts to undo a white slavery ring. Patterson provides another great read in the Alex Cross series. I always envision Morgsan Freeman as Cross since his lead in the Spider film."
1,Big Bad Bust,"I was very disappointed with Big Bad Wolf. This is the first bad book from Patterson. I only finished it with hopes of it getting better. It picked up towards the end and then it let me down. It was very boring. It was slow moving. The storylines were never finished. This was his worse book ever and it's being advertised as his best. Yeah, right!"
3,A little rushed,"The premise is excellent, the characters intriguing, but the writing felt a little rushed. This is not the elegant prose of Patterson's earlier novels that completely drew you in and made the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. Unfortunately, this offering felt more like a first draft."
2,Give Alex Cross a VACATION,"As a long time fan of James Patterson. I am extremely disappointed. While I have enjoyed his last few novels that DID NOT involve Alex Cross, I am having to say that I wish he would give Alex Cross a much needed vacation. If he can't come up with a better story plot than what this Big Bad Wolf book had, then maybe James Patterson should take a vacation also. The book ended horribly, obviously leaving it open for another book but I will not be rushing out to buy or borrow the next ""wolf"" book which will inevitably be on the book shelves before we can blink. I have one thing to say.. BIG BAD BOOK!"
2,This is becoming a rip off,"I've read every Patterson book to date, and am a big Alex Cross fan. This, however, is ridiculous. Big Bad Wolf makes little pretense at being anything other than the introductory chapters of a novel. It does not stand on its own, having little development other than the now-obligatory (and blatantly predictable) ""fake-out, wrong suspect"" scenes. The Kyle Craig two-booker was interesting. This is just a ploy by Patterson to get 40 bucks for one mid-length novel and a lot of filler."
2,"Sequel, Anyone?","My husband & I listened to this as a book on tape on a recent road trip, most of which was at night, during a winter storm watch. I mention that because it was stressful driving, so perhaps we didn't give the story the full attention it deserved...nevertheless, we followed it closely enough to be infuriated at the ending--or lack thereof. I can't remember another book of this genre leaving the reader so thoroughly unsatisfied and frustrated. This was my first Patterson experience, and my last."
4,Patterson's most elusive criminal yet...The Wolf,"While this was not the best Cross novel, I did enjoy the suspense behind the Wolf character. Just when it seemed like Alex was finally going to get him, surprise! The guy they apprehended was not the Wolf after all. He seems to be the toughest and most ruthless criminal Alex Cross has faced yet. The next novel in the Alex Cross series always picks up where the previous one left off, so I am looking forward to the next ""Wolf"" book. I was disappointed by the fact that Christine was awarded custody of Little Alex. I was hoping that Alex and Jamilla would finally get together, but not in this novel! I did miss some of the interaction with John Sampson. Hopefully we'll see more of him in the next novel. I'm not sure why there are so many reviews that were negative. I thought the writing was clear, and I wasn't confused by who any of the characters were. I plan to read 3rd Degree next...I can't get enough of James Patterson's books!"
2,not your vintage patterson,"this is a disappointing book. gets all mushy with alex cross joining the FBI etc. i am used to fast paced thrillers from patterson, and this is not one!!"
1,"disappointing ""fluff""","Is this what Patterson does best? This was my first book written by him and I read it because everyone else on my vacation was reading it. It was uneventful, illogical, and just plain unbelievable. It failed to excite and entertain. I will be hard pressed to pick up another Patterson book when there is so much more better written material out there!"
3,"Still Love Alex Cross, this book was a dissapointment tho","What is Alex Cross up to now that Kyle Craig is behind bars? Well he has decided to join the FBI. While he is having a bit of an unorthodox initiation training into the force he is pulled off of a couple of cases.Someone is out there kidnapping housewives and other unsuspecting middle class people without ransom, or any other clues. The person who is behind this is a new ""bad guy"" in the mix. He is known as the Wolf and he is a very dangerous former Russian who rules with an iron hand.Can Alex find him and those in his organizations and stop the kidnapping before more people are hurt?While this audio was unabridged at times it felt like Patterson had left out some parts. It may be that this book felt like he is setting up a new series and didn't spend as much time on his characters as he normally does. But, it might have just been my impression.Though I still enjoyed the story."
2,Just a movie script,"I thought the premise and writing, amateurish and stunted. A master criminal, controlling billions with a global empire, is personally running a low-budget, kidnapping-for-sex business, which would not have covered the overhead? Patterson wisely had half of the cast speaking in broken English so that complex sentences were not necessary. Seems as though everyone is looking for their serial bad guy to compete with Hannibal Lector, but there aren't enough writers like Thomas Harris to go around. It's just the next movie script. Let's hope for a great director."
1,Whatever happened to James Patterson,"I won't waste my time on this one. Needless to say, this is an author more interested in feeding the apparent insatiable appetite of Alex Cross fans than creating a compelling story. ""Along Came a Spider"" and ""Kiss the Girls"" were novels written by a promising new writer who cared about his craft; wanted to create a character that would live on for years to come. ""The Big Bad Wolfe"" is so sloppy and unsatisfactory that I had to go back to make sure I hadn't missed something. This one made me sick. See ya Alex. I don't care about you any longer."
4,Big Bad Wolf,Exactly the mystery I was looking for. From start to finish.The Cross series are some of the best I have read.
1,The Worst Author I Have Ever Read,"Patterson's writing is an insult to one's intelligence. I couldn't finish this book (a Christmas gift) it was so bad. The fact that he is a ""bestselling author"" is proof of the dumbing down of American society."
1,I am not J.Patterson fan anymore !,"Description everything of russian in this book -jargon, dialogs, sex life, food is ABSOLUTELY wrong ! We are not like that stupid !Author doesnot have any clue what he writes about. Looks like he saw stupidiest triller ""Red Heat"" in 1988 and have just copied""russian"" mobs from here.Now I do belive when real detective or fbi agent is reding his books he just laugh like me.Are all his books are FAKE ?!!!"
3,It's OK,"It's entertaining. The main character, Alex Cross, just has to much focus put on him. He's almost made into a superstar instead of a cop. Too much to be believable. The side stories of his personal life & children seem to be added fluff. The end leaves itself open for continuation. By far, not one of Patterson's best works."
3,a little far-fetched for me...,"Normally, I'm a big James Patterson fan and I love Alex Cross. However, this book didn't grab me and keep me wanting to turn the pages like most of Patterson's novels. Grant it, I realize it was written in 2003 and I'm a little behind with reading Patterson's novels, but this one I have to say is just average. I thought the plot was a little far-fetched, but at the end it got a little better. It's hard to imagine persons and events such as plotted in this book could actually happen, but then again we all know it's a crazy world we live in and, I guess, big bad wolves do exist.I picked this book up (used)in a book store, so I got it at a decent price. I'll just add it to my collection and if anyone asks, it's an average read. Not the best, but by far...not the worst."
1,TERRIBLE!!!,"Don't waste your time and money. I was very disappointed with this book. I actually threw it to the floor in disgust when I was through reading it. The writing is simplistic and there is no character development. The sentence structure and vocabulary are right out of an Elementary School level text. The only reason I even finished reading it was to have some closure and so I didn't feel like I had wasted my time by reading the beginning. Well, I certainly didn't get the closure I coveted. I wanted to mail the book back to the publisher in protest but I don't want to waste anymore of my money. If you enjoy richly developed characters and a plausible storyline you will not be happy with this purchase."
3,"Not the most enthralling book ever, but not bad either","This was my first James Patterson book. I have to say, given his popularity, I had expected a lot more. However, that doesn't mean that I didn't enjoy it either. It was a quick and easy read, perfect for fluff reading on my lunch break when I didn't want something so intense I couldn't put it down.It is exciting and action-orientated, with a quick plot and likeable main character. Again, this also being my first Alex Cross novel, I liked the character enough to thumb through the other books in the series.I don't know how this compares to other Patterson books, but I would consider it an okay book in an interesting series."
4,Big Bad Wolf,"I told you that you would be hooked. You are buying this book aren't you? You won't regret it. Oh, put the coffee on, it's gonna be a long night."
2,Cheated,"I've been a fan of patterson's books, but if ever there were a book that was simply published to make some dough, this is it. I love to read, and rarely feel cheated by a book, but a very thin plot, lousy characted development and almost zero real excitement actually had me ticked off when I read it. I will certainly not buy another Patterson book in hardcover. It's a waste."
3,A Middle of the Road Thriller,"As Alex Cross embarks on his first case as an FBI agent, readers can't help but wonder how many, ""worst killers"" the poor guy has to catch before he can take a vacation to sort out his dysfunctional personal life. Ironically, his dysfunctional relationship with his ""baby mama"" is possibly the most entertaining part of the novel. Unfortunately Patterson misses the mark with this novel."
3,"Quick to Start, Slow to Finish","As with all James Patterson novels, I read this one in a day. I was anticpating this novel because Alex Cross has left D.C. police and joined the FBI. I thought the Wolf was pretty terrifying, but not any more than Kyle Craig or Gary Soneji. The book eluded to the fact that this was Cross' toughest case yet, but I don't agree. I was very let down by the ending. I hurried through the book only to find that the Wolf escapes. If the wolf is as dangerous as he sounds, with him on the loose, Cross may be dead before we get to the next book! This book was a page turner (aren't they all) but disappointing to say the least."
2,Who stole the ending?,I look forward to the Alex Cross novels. I enjoyed this book until the last couple of chapters. Did Mr. Patterson have a plane to catch? What happened to the ending? Maybe the publishers left it out of my copy of the book?
2,A big bad let-down,"Patterson is one of my favorite writers, but this one was a huge disappointment. It was a messy amalgam of many of his previous books -- the escaped victim a la ""Kiss the Girls,"" the threat on Cross's family, a la....well, all of the Cross books, the help from a former bad guy...and the undecided ending. If this is the first of a series, then it doesn't enthrall me enough to pick up part 2. I am very unhappy to say this about Patty, but it's the truth."
1,Comic Book fodder,"If we were to rank this effort against the great Alex Cross Novels it wouldn't even be in the same ballpark. The Villian, ""The Wolf"" is totally unbelievable and in my opinion Comic book fodder. No intensity like ""Along Came A Spider"" and ""Kiss The Girls"" and I found myself shaking my head with disappointment at the end of many chapters.Patterson is throwing out lightweight drivel and expecting us to buy it. I guess I did ""buy the book"" but this is more like Sidney Sheldon, soap opera junk.Where have you gone ""James Patterson?"""
2,Big Bad BS,"I thought this book was really far fetched. Parts of this book are wonderful and very entertaining. Other sections of the book just do not seem accurate. I realize this is a fictional book, but I really think with a little more editing this story would have been great. I enjoyed reading the description of the kidnapping at Phipps Plaza in Atlanta as it seemed very accurate and scary down to every minute detail. On the other hand, the chat room crap seemed a little far fetched although who knows there are plenty of sick people in this world. I just do not really believe there would be people willing to pay money for other women in such a fashion, but who knows as maybe there really are people out in the world like mentioned in this book. I hope I never encounter them!"
2,A Letdown,"It started out good (as most of Patterson's novels do) and then it went down hill. I think that Patterson has taken Alex Cross as far as he can. It's pretty much unbelievable that the ""FNG"" of the FBI can just be thrust out onto the streets to solve the Wolfe kidnappings. Here's hoping Patterson can build on the Wolfe's character because he doesn't seem all that big and bad yet."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this one. kind of got the feeling, it was to keep us going to the book store to buy another James Patterson novel.I will say that he definitely makes up for it in the ""3rd Degree"" Awesome reading. I couldn't put it down. I'm here to tell ya, I'm a 330 pound football offical, exterminator by trade, and I got more than one tear stirring up in my eyes reading this one. I got really attached to the charcters. This ""3rd Degree"" is a MUST read."
2,The Big Boring Wolf,"2 1/2 StarsI have read every one of Mr. Patterson's books and have loved them all. However, The Big Bad Wolf was a bit of a let down for me. It felt as if a lot of the details were left out. I was also very disappointed in the ending. It seems as if there will be a sequel to this book, if there is I hope it's a little more exciting and less predictable."
4,Big Bad Wolf,"A slight dissapointment with hopes for a more faster paced sequal. Too many ""what if's"" were left in the story and the whole chase ends unlucky. Not as fast paced as his other books. A more look into Cross's life and how his transigiton to FBI is being affected by the Wolf case. I recommend it to Patterson fans."
2,Thin stuff,"This novel is your basic James Patterson product. Short paragraphs - little fleshing out of a story - lots of twists and turns in the hunt for a brutal killer - just interesting enough to keep you reading - but fairly thin gruel. Alex Cross, the ex-DC homicide cop who joined the FBI in Four Blind Mice is earning his spurs as he joins the hunt for the Wolf, a member of the Russian Mafiya who has plans to be the godfather of all organized crime. What initially has the FBI's attention is the kidnappings of white women who it turns out have been ""ordered"" by wealthy patrons who have designs on them. Why the Wolf would be involved in such an activity when his designs are so much larger is never explained. Patterson also brings a custody battle over Little Alex in to the story which does little or nothing to advance the plot, but perhaps he needed a few more chapters. He has done better and hopefully will again."
4,Warning: It&#65533;s not an easy game.,"This game is a little frustrating for any child who cannot yet associate a continent with the following clues: kroner, Ho Chi Minh trail, outback, Sahara. I had to help out more than either of us would have liked. On the other hand, it's fun, so she is motivated to try. And she is learning a lot!"
1,Carmen ripoff,I was under the impression that I had ordered Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego--the original version. What I got was a terrible version. My son and I played it for 5 minutes thinking it was the version we had rented from the library but it wasn't--it was horrible--graphics-wise and content. I can't tell you how disappointed I was!
1,fooled,"dont let the pictures fool you.. its not the same game..i had to return it because it ended up being "" the travels of marco polo"". I already have that one and it isnt as much fun as the original"
1,Did not load-very disappointed!!,"I tried several times to get this game to load on my XP system with no success. I am a geography teacher and thought I could use this game in my class, but I was sorely disappointed. It was a cheap price and I see why now."
3,Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?,"My grandchildren have not had a chance to play this yet so it's hard to review it. I used to love the game 15 years or more ago. I'm hoping that it is the same as it used to be. If it is, it will be a 5 star!"
4,An interesting read,"As a fan of the Onion I decided to check this book out. While not what I expected there are some great things here. It would've been easy for the authors to simply satirize the current administration, but they've done some serious research. Hidden beneath the jokes is some scary factual information (most sources are in the back of the book). Don't miss the bit about Rumsfeld and Aspartame (better known as Nutra Sweet). Also surprising is the 9/11 section. Instead of jokes, it contains around 80 questions that have yet to be answered about the 9/11 attacks. The sources are all there, so you can follow the trail that sparked the questions yourself if you doubt the authors."
5,Time to sit up and take notice.,"This book has a great deal of humor, but the satire contains the frightening truth about what has happened to democracy in America. Intelligent, witty jokes about Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Ascroft and the rest are extremely entertaining, but every page holds evidence that the American people have not been adequately informed about the actions of their government, or the consequences those actions will have for us, our children, and who knows how many generations to come. This book reminds me of my responsibilities as a citizen, and I'm going to make sure everyone I know reads it, and I'm going to do my best to see that each and every one of them votes in November!"
5,Great for the price,"I checked out a few of the Barbie castles and homes, and thought for the money, this one looked cute. Many of the other ones are $90 and up! I figured for a 4 y/o who recently started playing with Barbies, I'd start out smaller and see how she likes it rather than spending so much on a huge castle or house.I'd have to say, it was a good decision. It folds up so nicely, and provides just as much enjoyment for her. From what I can tell, the bigger sets are just that, bigger, but not much more to them and way too much money.We are into princesses here, so this is just perfect. Enough space for a few Barbies, and 2 girls (or mom and daughter) to sit and play!"
4,Cute castle for small homes,"This is a very cute item...it's probably not as cute as the bigger castles, but if you're short on space this is a winner. My daughters love the little hiding places, and the detailing is excellent. I like the fact that there are features included for the Kelly dolls also, like a bed that folds up into a seat for Kelly. There's enough little accessories included to keep any little girl happy, and the ""dance floor"" is fun. You can also use the Kelly dolls on the twirling dance floor. The dining table also becomes a full-length mirror so a princess can admire her gowns. Ths only negatives we've found so far are that the canopy for the bed does fall sometimes, but not every time, and you can't put all the pieces inside the castle when it's folded. It is nice to have a castle that can fit on a shelf though, and the toy is well worth the price."
3,My daughter loves it but...,"My daughter loves this toy. She spends hours playing with it. But it is a pain to assemble. Instructions are vague. It is not very durable. It falls apart every day. The best day of my life was when my daughter figured out how to put it back together on her own. It must be LOADS of fun, though, because not a day goes by when she doesn't play with it!"
4,fun toy,"we got this toy a while back and it shocked me that i only bought it for $5.29. i wish i bought a lot more to give as gifts. this toy has a lot accessories to play with and i like the fact that most of the big furniture are bolted in with the castle. to add more, the furnitures double as something extra so you're using something all the time. if my daughter can have her way, i think she'll play with this every day (but i sometimes put it up as a deco on her window... it's so cute)."
3,Barbie Castle - worth about $20,"First of all, I see that this is currently selling for $149 by an Amazon merchant. That is absolute highway robbery as this is only about a $20-$25 toy. It's small but includes some cute assessories including chairs, table, bed, tub, and tableware. The canopy bed is really cute and it's a fun toy to play with if your child will enjoy setting the barbies up in the various obvious scenes. My daughter has had this for a full year and has perhaps played with it a dozen or so times. I like the fact that we have been able to keep all the pieces together and nothing is broken. My daughter is finally getting the big Barbie Dollhouse but this certainly worked well in the meantime and will be a nice supplement next to the big dollhouse."
2,Flimsy!,"It is a beautiful castle after it is put together...but shame on Mattel for terrible, blurry, vague instructions! The canopy/footboard fall down everytime. The Kelly bed keeps breaking off! My 4 year old gets angry bc everything falls over! Mattel could have done much, much better! Not a great toy."
2,Save your money,"My doctor recommended this book in a vain hope of getting me to change my eating habits. Not a good investment. It takes 5 chapters to get to the central idea which is - only eat when you are hungry. The rest of the book simply restates this bit of wisdom in different ways over and over again. So here is my recommendation - ""Don't eat when you are not hungry"". There I saved you 10 dollars!!!"
1,Caution - does not fit 6300,Caution to buyers. This product does not fit a Nokia 6300 cell phone as advertised. This ear bud does not have a pin connector required by the 6300.
5,Go for a hacker ride along,"This is a fascinating book. You not only get in-depth material on the technical aspects of hacking, you also get an interesting ride along with the hackers themselves. Going deep into the hacker community. The book is well written and gripping for anyone who liked a book like The Cuckoo's Egg, but yearned for a little more depth to the technology aspect.If hacking is your thing then you will really enjoy this book. If you are a security person and you are interested in learning more about how hackers operate, then you should give this book a good look."
5,A book about REAL hacking,"This is an amazing book about hacking. This will open your eyes to the world of hacking in the same way 'Hacking Exposed' did when it first came out. But different than HE, this doesn't jut tell you the how it tells you the why, and accomplishes this through an interesting fictional story. Anyone in the infosec world will recognize the tools and techniques used throughout the book as completely real and accurate. In many cases the authors of the book are the creators of the tools themselves--like the chapter Fyodor wrote which uses Nmap. I enjoy reading security books, but it's become incresingly difficult to find truly unique, original material. This book certainly fits the bill."
4,It's very entertaining!,"I first read this book when it came out, but now that I have the paperback edition, I can review it properly. I find this particular book the best of the whole series.I'll just say that, while the writers are outstanding security professionals and some of them fellow researchers, we don't have much of literary skills here, but I'm glad they made the effort and the results are pretty good, but sometimes I felt disoriented as I was reading the book. As I said, it's a fast and entertaining read, with a basic development schema and a lot of focus on the technical side, managing to be interesting and thought-provoking in real-life sccenarios. The only detail I find discouraging is the quality of the screenshots, as their quality is not very detailed.Overall, it's a fun read! And obviously accurate."
3,$36? Seriously???,"I've heard these are amazing books and am looking forward greatly to reading them. But THIRTY-SIX DOLLARS for the Kindle version? What are you THINKING, Amazon?? And then people wonder why piracy is rampant."
5,"Lyrical love letters of pain, memory, loss, and optimism.","In Sorrow, a long time proponent of civil rights in Central America, plumbs the depths of grief and wrests hope from pain and memory in lyrics written as love letters to her deceased husband. These poems not only summon their shared past in vivid detail, but also ponder the meaning of death and separation, as well as the yearning for eventual reunion. Her's is an unforgettable, lyrical voice radiating strength and optimism in the face of loss and separation. Carolyn Forche has done a particularly excellent job of translation in this bilingual edition (Spanish/English). You Are Alive: You are alive in my breast/and only I can tell./You are the alchemist/who transforms our cries into poetry."
2,What is poetry?,"Claribel Alegria, Sorrow (Curbstone Press, 1999)Sorrow, a book of poems lamenting the death of Alegria's husband, is the kind of thing that, in a perfect world, would be immune to criticism. But, as Wilde so forthrightly put it, ""all bad poetry is sincere."" This is no exception. The poems in this collection are barely poems at all, but more often are simply thoughts chopped up into lines to make them appear poetic. ""Show, don't tell"" has left the building for this one, folks.""I don't want eternityit overwhelms meI want to be alivewhile I livewithout thinkingabout whyI live...""(""I Don't Want Eternity"")There are a few pieces here where Alegria still seems to grasp the essence of poetry (and translator Carolyn Forche seizes on two of them in her introduction, the best part of the book), but they are in the minority here. This one didn't work for me at all. **"
5,Da Wow!,"So your thinking about a transfer switch but do not want a lot of remodel...This one uses your exisisting elec box set up and fills the requirement of Isolating your generator from the power grid, which after all is the whole concept of a transfer switch. As always seek the advice of a qualified electrician, when you understand the game this one is simple to install. Never work on a circuit box ""hot"", never assume anything is terribly easy, anything worth having is worth the effort, always wear clean underware."
4,Cover kit was easy to install,The cover kit was very easy to install. I just removed 4 screws from the Transfer switch and replace them with the screws in the cover kit and that was it. It should have been included with the Transfer Switch.
5,This gal is one great fish-wife! What a book! Delish!,"At a time of cholesterol-watching, one could not ask for a better fish cookbook. And I say this as someone who never used to choose fish as a first choice. Leslie Revin's recipes are easy to follow -- and the results are fantastic. I hope she will use her talents to publish on other types of foods as well."
5,Simply the Best...,"I really think the title says it all. The album is, well, simply awesome. There's not a track I don't like. In fact, there's not a track I don't love. I own over two hundred CDs, and if I could only keep one, this would be it. What more can I say than that."
4,Smokey's alright,"I had never really been a big fan of Smokey Robinson's prior to ordering this CD. To be honest, I didn't like him at all. I have, alas, become a believer. This man's lyrics are soooo deep. I love the fact that I can listen to this CD and search for the deeper meaning in the songs. For instance, I never realized that in his song 'I've Made Love To You a Thousand Times,' that he was speaking figuratively and that it was a fantasy. But when I figured that out...OH MY WORD!!!! how seductive is that??!!! I believe that when he wrote Daylight and Darkness he had me in mind and didn't even know it. Baby Come Close, Quiet Storm, and Cruisin...all classics. Overall this is a very nice compilation. One that I'm glad I gave a fair shot to."
5,"Yes, learning is a blast!!!","I am so pleased to see that people are offering such appetizing faire for art appreciation! These card sets (there are two others: Impressionists and Renaissance) are absolutely fabulous and I have been telling all my friends about them. What an ingenious way to have fun while learning, something most of us homeschoolers are quite passionate about anyway! Even my youngest enjoys perusing all the interesting pictures (she's two), which is also why my only negative comment is that I wish the cardstock was heavier, but I suppose it was not manufactured with such young children in mind. Bravo to the makers of such an excellent product!"
2,one size doesn't fit all,"would have loved this item if it truly was universal, i have an 08 chevrolet hhr and it does not fit the seats well at all, will not stay in place."
3,Interesting yet unreadable,"The thesis of this book I found quite interesting and accurate: that anthropologists consider their subjects as existing in a different time from themselves, in some mythical past. However, the style of the writing seemed as if it was literally translated from the German. I found it very difficult to understand, opaque, and wondered many times why I was bothering to slog through the thing."
2,Not the easiest reading for a textbook.,"This is a very informative book and I will probably use it as a strong reference in years to come. It is not, however, a very easily read textbook. Some areas are repetative and make for very slow reading. Many times the author backs up her explanations citing studies. This is excellent in a reference book, however, as an introduction to an area of OT, it makes learning the subject matter laborious."
3,Not As Advertised,"This is NOT, as advertised, BBC sessions. It IS Australia '66 and the Hague '67----surprised, but not too disappointed as those two shows are hard to get. Worth it if you're a fanatic like me, but know what you're getting!"
4,This is the DVD that put Aziza on the map...,"Great DVD. Has a lot of non-traditional dancers. Not your typical ""young"" ""sinny"" girls. Aziza's perfomance at the end is one of the best ever. However, please know it's very ""Egyptian"" style. It has no tribal, sword, and so on."
4,Good for a younger baby,"I bought this because the price was good and we wanted to have a bouncer in both areas of our house so we didn't have to keep moving the one we had. It was great, but as our son grows I can see he will not be able to use it much longer. He's 17 lbs and 26 inches long and he probably has another month to use it."
4,Great look & comfortable,"An elegant shoe with some lovely metallic details. Don't usually wear heels these high, but overall they're super comfortable. Size runs a little big, but nothing an insert won't fix!"
3,not bad,"you cannot see the tape on the furniture without looking closely. at first my cat was suprised and averted, then the tape lost its stickiness as dust from the air got onto it. i guess one could take the strip down and put a new one, however my cat was too smart for the tape and learned to scratch around it.it did not work perfectly, but it did have some effect, and definetly may be worth a try."
3,Agh...,I didnt really care for any of the scenes save for the last 2 scenes. Was waiting for the stars to get involved.
4,The Exotic House of Wax,A good movie to see with GF/BF. Though it could be listed as a softporn. If watched together might lite some untold desires.
5,Buy this Video NOW,Love Wildfire's adventures. These stories are so great for kids. They lay a story out but leave your children with the option of filling in the blanks. We felt drawn in to Wildfire's adventures. It was as if we were in the Stone Forest with him. This type of animation helps your child build his/her imagination and creativity. A must buy!
1,Faulty CD! Skips like a kid at the playground!,"I bought this CD for my dad and was very disappointed to find out that it sounded awful! Plenty of skips. Pretty much every song is unlistenable. The worst part is, I was not able to get a return since he lives on the other side of the country and could not mail it for me in time. So now I'm out of my money and he has a worthless coaster. Don't buy this CD! You've been warned!"
2,Disappointiing ending,"Although Alexander McCall has an easy to read style that flows without requiring any intellectual effort, his books sound too much alike. Soon the charm becomes boredom and one desires to get to the end, not because of interest in the plot but just because one refuses to believe that it won't get better at some point.The Kalahari Typing School for Men is one of those stories that teases you with what one expects to develop into an interesting mystery but ends in a simplistic way.Definitely this is a case that proves that sequels are seldom better than the original."
5,Great series,"This book, along with Smith's other books was equally enjoyable. I plan on continuing with the series till the end. Well written, easy to follow, and just plain fun."
5,Kalahari Typing School for Men,"I love this series. It is a rare thing to find adult literature that is thought provoking, exciting, and clean. I feel like I have actually visited Botswana."
2,Another dissapointment but better then the last ones,"I have read 4 of the #1 ladies books and the first one was great then all the books started to go down in my books. Lots of people like the sequals but I dont I find they have no life, there boring and flat. This book is all of that but at times is o.k. when they add mystery. I am no longer going to read the other books becouse I am really dissapointed in the series."
3,Easy reading,"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency makes for good humored easy reading and I will recommend it to anyone who knows life in Botswana or who would like to know, seen through the traditional ladies' humoristic eyes. One critic I have is that the eight books could easily have been combined into one as the writer repeats himself assuming the reader has not read the previous books in the series, so it does become quite boring eventually."
3,"Fine, but getting repetitive","I like Smith's style. I find the stories soothing in their simplicity. The characters are likable but basic.You will not find anything different in this book than in the first few. Mr. JLB Maketoni tries to fix a pump at the orphanage. Mma Ramotswe solves a mystery while treating others with kindness and pining for the old Africa. Etc.I like to read these when I need something light, calming or peaceful, but if you are expecting a gripping mystery or something new in contrast to the other books in the series, don't bother. That said, I'm sure I will continue reading the series. I will just wait to continue until I've read some more serious books and need a break."
4,Another wonderful book in the series,"I enjoy this series of books - the writing is picturesque. I find myself comfortably transported into a world that I know nothing about. No serious issues in the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series - just fun, light reading."
4,A pleasure to read -- African culture & values shine thru...,I enjoyed the book very much. I love the way the African culture permeates the story. I really enjoyed some audio books by this author as they were read by an African woman. It was a very pleasant listen -- prompted me to check out other audio books in the series. I love the way the love of country comes thru & the values of Mma Ramotswe are revealed in her speech. I may be a little bit African deep inside. I love the folks in this book.
4,"Short on detecting, long on relationships.","This fourth book in the series brings not a heck of a lot of detective work, and none of the astute problem-solving that made book one a literary treasure.The main attractions this time are the opening of a rival detective agency powered by testosterone, the launching of a typing school for men powered by girl power, a long overdue apology powered by guilt, and at long last, a love interest for Mma. Makutsi, powered by hair grease and slime.The author takes us a few levels deeper into the characters this time, and the result is a rich African brew, ideal for slow lazy sipping under a shady tree with a gentle breeze ruffling the pages, and of course a hot cup of bush tea.Not ground breaking or earth shattering, but a very pleasant read anyway.Amanda Richards, November 23, 2004"
3,Decent Phone Hub,"I have an Open House Structured Wiring Box, so it makes sense that I would use a Open House Telephone hub. I was planning to use the Wiring box mostly for data use, but certain existing phone lines were not working in my house. So I made the jump to add this to my box and it is nice to have centralize the phone system. I use VOIP instead of a Bell company so this works to my needs just fine."
2,very dated,"This book was written before video and computational power was easily available. It is quite dated and it is also just not written that well. As a trained physicist myself, I was hoping for some clearer insights into the nature of the swing, but I think the book was just written too early, before it was really possible to analyze swings in real detail."
2,Valid as far as it goes,"What Jorgensen did was concentrate on the easily observed movements of one expert golfer, i.e. the movement of the forearms and upper-arms, leading shoulder, and feet and legs, and presented nothing new or really helpful.He made no comments on what Sam Snead called ""all the swing"" -- rhythm and timing, and no observation of the most important parts of the body, the hands. Hand-eye coordination is THE essential element of golfing talent, but even with great hand-eye coordination, you have to know what to do with the hands."
4,Just needs decent graphics and illustrations,"I enthusiastically recommend this book to golfers with an interest in science/math/engineering, or scientists/mathematicians/engineers with an interest in golf. You should get Search for the Perfect Swing first. But once you have that out of the way, this book is an excellent addition to a golf library.The biggest shortcomings of The Physics of Golf are (1) a lack of quality illustrations/pictures/graphics and (2) a rather terse treatment of the material. I feel that the author probably has enough research to go on for 4-500 pages but called it quits at a much more concise size. I'm all for concise, but not when it leaves me feeling some useful material was left out."
3,Moderate success,"I do agree with the author that mechanical physics can and should explain explain golf, unfortunately for me I did gained and understand only small part of the book scope and promise.. I have some basic understanding of Newton Physics and still I have difficulty in understanding the mathematical and technical stuff in this book maybe because there is much to be improved in the quality of the Pictures, Figures, Mathematical Equations and the clarity of the text.."
1,A lacklustre effort,"Despite some handsome ink wash landscapes and cityscapes, this is a plodding low-budget adaptation. Needless to say, drastic cuts in the plot are necessary to scale Dickens's novel down to the length of a short film, but thanks to clumsy script-writing and editing, the plot is not very clear for children. There's surely a better way to initiate kids to this story."
5,There are many things I love about the cards!,"""I picked up a pack of divination cards called ""Crop Circle Cards."" My inner voice said, ""Buy them."" I did and I studied them. I wasn't seeing through a clear lens at that time but they still seemed to have an uplifting message - each and every one. It also seemed uncanny that whenever I asked a question, the card I drew seemed to be what I needed to read and meditate upon. There are many things I love about the cards, but one thing about them in particular came through as the most important message to me. And that message is that we are all multi-dimensional beings."" Chester H.- March 26, 2003"
4,Lady Detective Triumphs Again,"I so enjoyed the HBO series a couple of years ago, but have only begun reading the series recently. This third book has the virtues of one and two: written in simple, effective style; taking an affectionate stance towards its familiar characters; creating an idealistic, almost magical world where thoughtfulness, patience, love and determination reign, malice is treatable, and violence is heard only in muted echos. I can't help picturing the TV actors as the main characters, but I don't mind, because they were played so well, particularly Mma Ramotswe. Long live bush tea!"
3,Not as good as the first two,"This was pleasant to read, but there was nothing new here. Maybe I'm moving through the series too quickly, but in this novel I started to get bored with the characters and their trials. The mysteries were just not as interesting as before. Many of the characters, even the returning ones, fell flat. Here's hoping the fourth book is better."
4,3rd best of the series so far,"I am reading the Number One Ladies Detective series in order, and this is clearly the worst of the three I have read so far. However, that isn't a bad indictment on this charming and easy to read book.In this book, our hero's assistant, who was promoted to Assistant Detective in Tears of the Giraffe, finds herself in an expanded role in the detective business, and in the automotive repair business too. For reasons not entirely explained, Mr J.L.B. Matekoni suffers from depression and takes a theraputic vacation, leaving his business in the hands of his fiancee and her trusted assistant. I was disappointed that we didn't find out more about the cause of the depression, but perhaps that is the cliffhanger to lead the reader to the next book, The Kalahari Typing School for Men.There are two main detective tales in this book, one involving each of our two lady detectives. Each are solved with uncommon common sense from two of the smartest women in Africa."
5,mma ramotswe and the heart of africa,"alexander mccall smith's series about the traditionally built mma ramotswe and the people in her life is truly a landmark: a quiet and humble landmark, but a landmark nonetheless. with great compassion and humor mccall smith describes the trials and errors of modern africa, seen through the eyes of a most formidable private detective. the series is written with a lot of humor, a great deal of humility, and a love for africa that is so strong that it seeps through the text and pours into the heart of the reader. it has been a long time since I last read something this enjoyable: mccall smith has truly captured the heart of africa in his series."
3,Losing our way,"I am slightly concerned ... this has been to date such a charming series right up there with such classics as Wind in the Willows.But alas as series continue, especially ones so well received as the life and times of Precious Ramotswe, the author seems to come to believe it is his story. In this particular case we find Precious discussing such unrelated things as the relevance of existentialism, the theories of David Leaky, women's rights, yada yada yada.Mr. Smith, if you out there more focus on Ramotswe and the trials and travails of the the Dective Agency and Speedy Motors and less as a vehicle for better world understanding. sigh :("
2,stiff PC prose,"Read the sample pages on Amazon...the author obviously set himself the task of raising consciousness about life in Africa, specifically female life in Botswana. His political purpose may be admirable but the writing is stiff, preachy, and ultimately uninteresting. Not wretched, but a chore to read. How many women refer to a prospective fiance in their most private thoughts as Mr. J. L. B. Jones? 'Nuff said."
2,Treading water,"I read the first volume of the ""No 1 Ladies Detective Agency"" and now volume 3. By comparison, vol 3 dwells too much on the personal lives of Mma Ramotswe and her husband to be. These parts of the book are uninteresting and did not engage me much. On the other hand, very little detecting is done in this book. The main character really handles only one case, and while in the first volume this was where her earthy wisdom shone through, here her advice is not as convincing, as if she has her mind on other things.On the other hand, the minor characters in this book are delightful. It was good to see the assistent come into her own, and the mechanic apprentices insert a much needed comic note into the story.In all, this book feels like the author is treading water, not sure where to take his characters. He is shifting from the series-of-vignettes to a more long form novel, but the result is not convincing. Yet."
2,Disappointing,"First of all, I think that it is reprehensible that a book of this caliber is published without being proofread!! There were at least 7 typos and it completely took away from my enjoyment of the story. There is no excuse for such sloppy editing. Secondly, the story lacked the imaginative and insightful detective aspect of the first two. Very disappointing!"
1,"Unbelievable and clumsy, PC junk","Read the sample pages on Amazon...this junk would never have been printed in a non-PC world. The writing is clumsy, preachy, and ultimately uninteresting. How many women refer to a prospective fiance in their most private thoughts as Mr. J. L. B. Jones? This is the actual first sentence of the book...if you can make it through this without throwing the book down in disgust, you might like the rest of it too:""Mma Ramotswe, the daughter of the late Obed Ramotswe of Mochudi, near Gaborone, Botswana, Africa, was the announced fiancee of Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, son of the late Pumphamilitse Matekoni, of Tlokweng, peasant farmer and latterly chief caretaker of the Railway Head Office.""Please. Life is too short for this."
4,I shed tears along with the Government Man,"Precious Ramotswe, ""a woman ... in Africa, which was who, and where, she wanted to be,"" returns in this third installment of Alexander McCall's gentle series about Botswana's ""No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency."" Mma Ramotswe's assistant, Mma Makutsi, comes into her own as a detective in her own right and as the ""acting manager"" of Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni's Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors. Mma Romotswe makes a powerful Government Man remember his manners and solves his case with powerful compassion. Mr. McCall's writing, as in the two prior books, is humorous, wise and often lyrical. A couple of threads in the book are left loose - perhaps to tantalize us into reading the fourth novel in the series - The Kalahari Typing School for Men. It has worked for me."
1,You know...,Terry Eagleton has later admitted that its a book based on rumors and on actual readings of the philosophers mentioned...i guess that says it all.

5,"A Warm, Melodic Bill Morrissey Classic!","Bill Morrissey is a songwriting treasure. You'll Never Get To Heaven (his 8th album) offers rolling, relaxing rhythms and bluesy folk, often with a tad more ""band"" ornamentation than usual. Morrissey's songwriting and delivery is at a peak here. As a songwriter, there are few folk artists who have Morrissey's gift for telling a story - tidy vignettes wrapped in warm melodies. A Must Hear artist and a Must Hear album.GENRES: Contemporary Folk.BUY IF YOU LIKE: Greg Brown, John Prine, Richard Shindell, Townes Van Zandt.MUST HEAR TRACKS: ""When Summer's Ended,"" ""As Long As The Sun,"" ""Ashes, Grain and Sand,"" ""Different Currency."""
5,Bill Morrissey's best 1990s album,"YOU'LL NEVER GET TO HEAVEN is Bill's best of the 1990s, and a masterfully realized album. INSIDE (1992) is an excellent album too, but for me, the richer instrumentation of this one adds to its depth.His songs are brilliant short stories, and they tell the lives of the majority, the non-beautiful people who used to be known as working people before that became passe' in our oh-so-hip society. ""As Long As the Sun"" has a melody that you'll find circling in your head for days. When the horns kick in on the title track, they add the perfect ominous touch.Sadly, Morrissey died at the age of 59 in July 2011 after a long struggle with alcoholism."""
3,An Honest Folkie,"He's good enough, sings some interesting stories, but nothing really sets him apart for me -- not his lyrics, not his arrangements, and certainly not his half-whisper, held-in-check voice. Every once in a while, as in Closed Down Mill, he threatens to get a little rowdier and I'd like to hear more of that. While I'm at it, give me more horns and humor too -- the horns are an unusual and inspired twist, especially on Big Leg Ida, a nice bit of rag and humor. Overall though, this is just too gentle and understated for me, respectable, but nothing that raises him above the sincere and so serious new folk masses."
3,"Pretty, but...","It was just ""okay."" I sent it back, but only because I needed a special piece for a wedding. This would have fit the bill, if it weren't for the fact that it was jointed and wouldn't lay flat. Because it kept twisting and turning, you lost the look of it. Also the clasp was very small and hard to open. It took me about five minutes to get the necklace off by myself. In the end, I decided that it was a bit too ""chokery"" in length, and I needed something longer... maybe 18"" instead of 16"". So the search continues. But I have to say... if you are looking for a unique choker, this is a nice and unique piece of jewelry. The stones were nice, the purple was as pictured on-line... not pale like a lot of the amethysts you get on the net. And the silver was pretty... nice and shiny, obviously sterling. It's a good value, if that style is what you're after."
2,Mixed bag very dissappointing,"Although this CD is not nearly as bad as Sylvia Hotel, I find foolishness like the Prozac song to be pathetic and clearly beneath the considerable talents of Ms. Wheeler. Unfortunately as can been seen in her live concerts in recent years she is much more concerned with being a comedian than the stunning singer/songwriter that she is capable of being. Id pass on this disc. Go buy ""Driving Home' or ""Half A Book"" It genuinely saddens me to see such talent squandered"
3,"A Dead-End Search, But A Really Good Book","I heard of Willie Sutton. The name was mentioned here and there as I grew up, but only spoken in hushed, almost reverent tones. Upon reaching adulthood I found out why. Willie Sutton was a bank robber, like my father. It is alleged he taught my father everything he knew about how to rob a bank. Of course, in adulthood my interest was piqued, so I got the book, more because of research than anything else. Well, I didn't find out anything about my father but ended up finding an extremely interesting, easy-to-read book about a very intelligent man who used his talents in the wrong way. Unfortunately for him, his life didn't amount to much; however you have to admire the fact that in the end he finally came to that realization and wrote the book to try to sway the next generation of potential hoodlums in the way of the straight and narrow. A smart man.. who finally put his intellect to good use. I would definitely put this book on my ""things to read"" list."

5,Pleased,I don't know about the product.I ordered for a friend and I know he is well pleased with it or I would hear about it I am sure!
2,Stop working about two weeks ago. Cannot getting back on?,This unit stopped working on my stove about 2 weeks ago. I would not recommend it try another brand etc.
3,Not true Gur,Note: this is not true Gur. Jaggery is sugar made in India from sugarcane whereas Gur is made from the date palm.
2,Unsteady garden kneeler,"I thought the idea of having a handled kneeler when weeding would be very helpful but the pad is off the ground so that when you reach forward to weed, it tips forward, leaving you feeling off balance and unsteady. I did not attempt to use it as a bench and have no comment on that."
3,Here's The Rub,This book is all VB.Net 2005. There's no C# code in the book or available for download. This really limits the audience and you should know this before you purchase this book. To be fair to the author I should note that my rating reflects this fact and no further reading of the material since I intend to return it right away.
1,Nothing professional about this book,"This book is, by no means, Professional ASP.NET 2.0 Programming. First, it is all VB.NET (Not the choice of professionals). Ok, the book does not cover the typical topics you find in a beginner's asp.net book, but the topics it covers are merely new features in asp.net 2.0 discussed in a very superficial way.The only chapter I found to be worth while reading is the one on Web Parts. Some level of detail there, but do not expect much. This book should be re-named to, ""New Features in ASP.NET 2.0 - A beginners approach to programming"".If you are looking for a professional programming book, this is not a great buy. If you are looking to get your way around asp.net 2.0 without all the typical beginner's stuff, then this book is for you (if you do not mind VB.NET).2 stars off for the bad title and 1 star off for VB.Net"
2,repairs cost $50,"Great radio, but my antenna broke after the 1 year warranty expired and they charged $50 to fix, Wen you spend $200 on a radio, you expect better support. I wouldn't recommend this product."
2,Tivoli should be ashamed,It seems this company has jacked up the prices on all their products. The iPal used to cost $130 but now it's $199? That's insane. If you look at their other stuff everything is $50-$100 more than they were last year. How do they justify these huge price hikes? I bought the Tivoli Model Two radio from Amazon last year for $160 and now it's $300. Shame on you Tivoli.
5,Best AFORDABLE portable speaker system for iPod,"I have spent over 2 months trying to find a portable speaker system to complement my iPod. The problem was that most systems I tried either sounded horrible or cost more then the actual iPod (Bose sound dock). This system however was extremely affordable (at almost a third of the price of the sound dock) and it sounds great, with excellent bass and midrange response for its size, plus it has its own built in rechargeable battery making it easy to take anywhere. It also is at heart a radio, so if my iPod battery dies (because that never happens) I can still find something to listen to. The only thing this item lacks is the dock connector which would be a great asset, eliminating the somewhat ""messy"" cord (which is not included) needed to connect an iPod or other peripheral device. I would recommend this product to anyone who appreciates quality sound as well as value."
2,Follow up to Planned Obsolescence,"For those of you slightly mechanically inclined, the PAL is quite easy to disassemble. I dove in recently (since my review), removing the various components to access and disassemble the volume and function pots. Gave them a good spray with no residue contact cleaner and worked the little plastic inner part back and forth. There's essentially no identifiable electrical contacts in pots, but I gave it a shot anyway. Reassembled and was surprised to hear clear and consistent volume. I've listened for over 8 hours now and can declare it fixed.Just read Jason's recent review - bummer on the reneged offer! I'm knocking my review down to a 2 due to my labor for repairs and his customer service experience."
2,On/Off/Freq. Switch Fails,"I like this radio a lot for all the reasons cited by other reviewers. Its Achilles Heel and fatal flaw is a cheesy switch for the On/Off/Freq selection which fails prematurely. I found only one other review which cited this problem. I have had two of these radios (one an out of warranty replacement for a $75 fee)and this switch failed gradually after about a year on both.By the way, my local strip mall battery shop put together rechargeable battery packs for me for this radio which I think were cheaper and certainly more convenient than ordering from Tivoli."
2,Just too pricey,"We got one of these some years ago for about $130, and though that seemed a bit steep, this has been a swell little radio: easy to carry around the house, goes a long time on a charge, sounds good for its size.But $220??? What changed to make it cost $90 more? So 5 stars for performance, but 2 stars due to plain greed on the part of the manufacturer."
5,Wonderful Sound!,I just hooked my Ipod to the Audio PAL and let it GO...the sound is amazing. This radio is worth the price.
3,Good sound but poor FM reception and weird MP3 input selector,"I bought this based on user's recommendations but am only partially satisfied with the Radio. On the good side it has good sound for the size and excellent battery life. On the bad side I don't get very good FM reception. Also, it is weird that you do not choose the MP3 input with the AM/FM input know -- instead you have to plug in your MP3 player. I would much rather switch the knob rather than plug/unplug the player from the back."
2,Poor FM reception,Nice little package with deep sound for such a small unit. A little heavy on the bass. But the FM reception is so bad that this radio is worthy of only 2 stars.
5,I love it!,I am so glad I read other reviews before choosing this radio. It is perfect. Excellent tone and sound for such a compact radio.
5,Tivoli Audio Pal,"Excellent radio - all it's cracked up to be! Tuning easy, audio clear. Love that it is portable and weather resistant."
4,Good but expensive radio,"This is a good radio but it is expensive. I like my iPal but looking back I would have been better served purchasing a nice Bluetooth speaker. I do love the classic look of the device. And the rechargeable battery is great. It is definitely a nice product, just may not be the best value out there."
2,Good for 119 but 199??!!!,Just a year ago this product was 100-130$. Good for the price but when I went to purchase a second one and saw a price hike on old technology in no way will I buy a second one. This is way overpriced for what it is.
2,Tivoli model one table radio,perfectly good sound but I could not get local am channel generally available on other portable radios. Battery pack is a disaster. can't find it anywhere and Radio Shack offered to order one for me for about $25...for a battery for a $100 radio???
4,TIVOLI RADIO,"I was looking for a different looking radio for my bathroom and I believe I have found it. I have only had it for a month but everything seems fine. I have only one comment. It would have been nice to have a sound control option, for me it has too much bass but I can live with it."
2,dead after less than 3 years,"when I bought this I reviewed this way: ""charming little radio with great sound; love everything about it; great with iPod; wish I could buy a few more!"" Well, almost 3 years later my iPal died. Won't take a charge. $25 battery pack did not work. Need to spend $50 to have repaired plus shipping cost. Do I want to spend close to $100 to fix a $200 radio -- no."
2,Expensive bad radio,"I've owned this radio for less than a year and in that year I have replaced the batteries twice,now the radio won't play unless I jump start it plugged in, after that it will work several hours unplugged but whenever I turn it off I again have to jump start it.While removing the battery one of the two fragile screws snapped off.Another problem is terrible reception,mostly static.I called Tivoli and was told they will repair it for $50.00.So you can make up your own mind whether this expensive radio is really worth it or not.I registered it immediately after I recieved it and Tivoli will not fix it without a receipt, Does anyone keep a receipt that long?Total cost $200 for the radio, over $50.00 for batteries, and now another $50.00 for repairs plus the shipping charges.I have only taken it out of my house one time and the rest of the time it stays on my desk plugged in.I personally will never buy another Tivoli product."
3,Sounds great... when I can get a station...,"I live in the suburbs of Philadelphia. Given the reviews about great reception, I thought that this would be a great purchase. Well, maybe I have a defective radio, because the reception my radio gets is pretty bad or, better said, no better than my $15 clock radio. AM reception is particularly bad. On other radios, I can routinely get New York AM stations during the day without much difficulty. Not so much with the Tivoli...Case in point for folks in Philly: On other radios, I can usually get WRTI 90.1 (Temple's home of classical and jazz) with little difficulty and little/no static. On the Tivoli, static has a way of ruining the fun...That said, it DOES sound great. It DOES look pretty cool. If you are in a city with great AM/FM stations, buy one without hesitation. If you aren't, well, be aware of Amazon's return policies!!"
4,Its a little expensive,"The radio is pretty good, but its a little expensive..However it does look like it appears, so it is pretty good"
3,Good but not worth $188,"I've had my PAL for at least 5 years, and paid closer to $120 for it. Back then it was worth it, and I was looking for a second one, however now at $188 I'll keep looking. It sounds very good, and has a very quality feel to it. Battery life was OK as I remember (it sits on a shelf plugged in now). The major problem I have with it is that some time after the warranty period was over the rubberized covering began to peel. As it was a lot of money to spend on a radio in the first place, I took very good care of mine. I did not move it around much, and certainly did not abuse it. I was very disappointed because it changed from a cool, quality portable radio to a shabby-looking, good sounding radio. After years I figured either the features would have been enhanced, or the price lowered, but I cannot justify spending more for the same old product."
3,Tuner is less than desired but with patience can be improved,"Updated 3/12/2009With some practice you can learn to tune this radio. With that knowledge my current rating would be 4 1/2 stars.The trick is to tune with the dial and then shorten or lengthen the antenna till you get the best reception and sound.On most counts this is a dandy little radio. The sound is great, the rechargeable battery lasts for many hours and recharges quickly. You can play an MP3 player through the speaker. The only down side is the tuner. The stations drift in and out and it will receive two stations at the same time. A radio in this price range should have a better tuner."
5,Outstanding,"This movie is incredible; perhaps not so much for its acting / technical aspects but just the sheer power it has to move people and make them think. I first saw it over a year ago and it is a movie that I still think of often. You will not regret watching the movie, and it will likely stay with you for quite some time."
3,very popular in pakistan,"this was a very popular film in pakistan and now it is available in this dvd which has a choice of subtitles in english/french/german/spanish/italian/ or portugese. it is not a very sophisticated work but it has its moments. the cinematography is far superior to the screenplay and the directing (the actors were at a disadvantage). with a little more thought and a better director, it could have been made an international bestseller. the only extra included is a musical video."
3,First translation,"Wm. Turner was Dean of the Sch. of Social Work at U. Penn, where Rank taught in the 1930s. The text is incomplete, seems to be a chapter missing, and a second, complete translation was done recently: Johns Hopkins U. Press, 1998."
3,FirstSounds Deluxe Prenatal Gift Set,We can't really hear the baby at all moments you get external sounds most of the time.
1,This thing is terrible... DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"We bought this when expecting our first child. It is awful in everyway. First, it is poorly built and is made from very cheap materials. The most important point is that it does not work. All that can be heard is feedback from movement of the receiver. It is impossible to hear any heartbeat. Don't waste your money on this device."
4,It's great!,When my husband and I recieved the BeBe we were so excited. We opened it up and tried it out right away. It's amazing!! We could hear the baby moving and her little heartbeat. It's Definately worth getting!
2,Not worth it,"I paid $50 in a store and its not worth it. As said above you cannot hear your babys heartbeat above the gurgling and movements within. I was shocked to find out that for $50 i had to go out and buy my own cd player! t has some headphones that you put on your belly and play music from your mp3 or cd player, but if thats all im getting out of this then the package is not worth it. Shoulda just held my ear buds from ipod onto belly"
5,"Tried many, this is the one","Listen up..I have owned the Creative Nomad 20g, an Archos 10G, and the Rio 5000. I took them all back due to various issues such as User interface, software errors (I am a software developer and know an error when I see one), shoddy construction etc. I eventually decided that I would try the iPod even though it costs a lot more. Well folks, its worth every cent-the interface is great, the quality of construction is superb, and the ease of use, is well enough to make me go and try a Mac after 23 years with Intel PC and Dr. Bill's OS, re-boot is the fix. If a Mac is anything like the iPod, have I ever missed the boat."
4,Great product; too bad it doesn't work with WMA,"The product has the best form factor and user interface out there for portable music players. Too bad the PC support is an afterthought. I'd give this product 5 stars if it supported WMA and had real integration into Windows Media Player 8 or 9. WMA9, especially WMA VBR, is a great alternative MP3... smaller files, great sound quality & fast ripping/encoding. Even cheap portable players from Rio and Creative Labs support WMA. Jeers to Apple and their anti-Microsoft technology view."
5,As Mindblowing as the Original Walkman!,"I think the 20 gb iPod is so superbly designed and integrated with the Mac OS 10.2 operating system it is as revolutionary as the original Walkman. I have over 700 songs, 2000 digital photos, all my contacts, calendars for my wife and two kids and a backup of my system folder on my iPod...with about 8gb of room to spare. It is so easy and simple to use it blows me away. Everything about it is so well designed and thought out!!Buy one...you'll never regret it!"
1,"I'd have more comments, if it worked!","My computer is a Dell, 333MHz, PII, with LOTS of memory and a 40 Gig HD. I've installed two FireWire cards. The machine can see the iPod -- it shows up as Drive F. I can even move files onto the device with Windows Explorer and copy them back off to another location. Of course, the iPod can't use the information that isn't loaded using the MusicMatch interface. But that is the end of communications with the little toy. At times, the little icon in the taskbar even showes that it is connected. But it sits for hours with the ""do not unplug"" sign flashing.Two days of struggle and it is going back..."
4,very happy ipod owner after some initial problems,I recently bought the ipod (win). I initially had trouble using the firewire card on my laptop but I have heard that there is sometimes difficulty with built in firewire cards on laptops. I am still not sure if this was the case with my laptop. I have since then installed a firewire card on my desktop computer which works fine. The supplied software is lacking in many respects. I ditched it all together and am now using Xplay. I have taken the ipod running and to the gym and have not experienced a single skip yet. The ipod is by far the best on the market.
2,Think twice if you plan on jogging with it...,The Apple iPOD is a great device with a couple of severe drawbacks.1) The iPOD device portion of the MusicMatch software is [not good]. Updating my 20g iPOD with about 9g worth of data has taken over 1hr and is necesary each time you make even the slightest change to your library. Fortuanantly I was able to sign up to Beta Test the new XPlay software that supports this unit and it works great.2) This unit will not work well for anyone hoping to jog or bike etc. with it. My wife and I have been running with it and it basially freezes up 90% of the time. Apple product support told me that there is no fix and confirmed that others have experienced the same issue.The bottom line is don't get an iPOD if you need a unit to run with.-----------------------------------I returned my unit to Apple and recieved a new one in the mail in about 3 days. Great service... But this new unit locks up when I run as well...
5,Nothing comes close,"I have had my 20gb IPod for about two months and it becomes more valuable to me each day. It is truly the best audio device I have ever bought and certainly outclasses every other MP3 or CD device on the market. Apple's design is perfect.The MusicMatch software that comes with IPod frustrated me at first, but now that I have experience with it, it is a fantastic complement to IPod. This software is so feature packed, there isn't anything it won't do.I was concerned about the price of IPod at first, but when I looked in my drawer and counted all of the other devices I had bought and had been unsatisfied with, the price made sense.If you want to have your entire music collection, lectures, personal recordings, and whatever with you at all times, this is it. You will never run out of space. I have almost everything audio that I own on IPod and it isn't half full.A must buy product."
2,Do not buy it if you plan to jog or run with it,"It is a great gadget, incredibly practical to bring your music everywhere. If you want to bring it jogging, forget it. It freezes each and every time and you'll end up just carrying it along. Get something else. At Apple, they say it wasn't built to be used as an excercise companion."
5,"It's Awesome, must have","Don't listen to all the other comments complaining, the ipod kicks! It's so simple. I've had to problems with anything. I have a Gateway laptop, it works amazing with it. You will not regret purchasing it. Also, to the person who said musicmatch was a terrible program, I've been nothing but happy with it. It works so smothly and it's very easy. Buy the iPod, you won't regret it."
4,Ipod: Nice Product but can be better.,"I have had my 20GB iPod for about 3 weeks and it is a wonderful product except for the price. It looks nice and stylish. Quality is excellent, the earphone set is good but the pads can be better. I replace the original earpads with a $2 set from Radio Shack. One thing that I don't like the ipod is that all parts are non-replaceable. The battery, the hard drive, the electronic part... I am concerned most about the battery. Battery will die overtime, its capability of keeping charge degrades over time. The hard drive is also tends to fail overtime. It is a matter of when not if and it can happen within a year."
2,Lens popped off right away...,"Nice looking glasses but a little small for a man's face I think. But the real problem is right after I cut the tag off and went to wipe/clean the glasses before putting them on, one of the lenses popped right off with no effort. I tried popping it back in and barely was able to get it on but it was fragile, kept popping back off before I got it to settle in, gingerly put in on my eyes but the lens was barely hanging on. Returned the item."
1,won't be fooled again,poor quality- way over priced- first pair broke within a week- why should they/you care ?
4,I gotta get a tattoo at 12:30 and I don't wanna be late.,"This CD features remixes of Christmas songs from the Capital Records vault. The songs originally were recorded in the 1950s and '60s. The remixes were done in 2004 and 2005. The songs have been remixed into an ""electronica"" style, in most cases. It's kind of an odd idea, but it works, for the most part. The results sound classic but contemporary at the same time. I particularly like the remixes of ""Rudolph"" and ""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town"". This is a fun Christmas CD that gets something new out of something old."
3,"It's ok, not great.","Not a bad CD, just not as good as some others in the remixed holiday music category. Has a couple of good songs. Reindeer Room and Holiday Remixed are way better!"
3,Good player but not the most intuitive,Great - but sometimes had to get going. You should download Ephpod - especially if you are on a Windows machine.
1,Yuck,I bought one of the Windows Ipods when they first came out and have had nothing but trouble with the software for downloading music and books (Audible). Music and books would have gaps or be completly unplayable. I would advise looking at the user comments on Apples own web site before buying one of these.
2,Still a few bugs in the iPod,Elegant device. Unfortunately it is not quite ready for prime time from my persepective.I bought the iPod specifically for the ability to store and listen to long books and shows from Audible.com. To my dismay I discovered that there is a bug in the 1.2.1 firmware for the Windows iPod that causest the bookmarks to be erased every time I connect the iPod to my PC. This renders the device useless for listening to anything from Audible longer than 30 minutes as I would have to manually write down my location in each book that I am listening too. No thanks.Then I learned today that there is another bug that causes the battery to drain completely when the iPod is just sitting unused for a few days. Not the kind performance I expect from a piece of electronics. It looks like I will be returning this one.
3,"Excellent descriptions, but disappointing photos","This book had excellent descriptions of tracks and habitats of different animals in North America, but I was disappointed in the photos. Most of the photos of tracks were in snow, not dirt or mud. Also, in order to get a description of track size,you must read the text. There were very few pictures of scat and other signs as well. This is a good book if you want to sit down and read about animal tracks and signs, but a poor reference in the field. If you want a field book, look elsewhere."
1,one useless book,this book is really useless for identifying tracks. The photographs are blurry and almost all in snow.. This is Texas. I bought the Peterson Guide and that is the book to have. Should have gotten it in the first place. You might want to take this off your site.
3,A project to side with,"In a plethora of shallow Godspeed side-projects exploiting existential dread, SFTF's first album is one of the few relatively solid releases. Relatively because there is still nearly half a disc filled with underdeveloped audio moping that doesn't really go anywhere, but fleshed out enough to make this a valid purchase for Efrim aficionados."
2,Great game but crashes frequently,I bought this game because I loved playing it when I was a little kid. This game was supposed to be compatible with the latest operation systems such as windows 7 which is what I have. The game crashed very frequently making me lose my place in the game every time. Very upsetting.
1,This games was not for windows 7,I didn't have a chance to give this to my son because the description said it was for windows 7. When I got it home it WAS NOT. Amazon was very nice to me but the seller gave them and me a hard time. Sometimes the description from the seller is not quite accurate. Of course I had to return it......
1,Cannot play on 64 bit PC,"I contacted the publisher, and this game will NOT run on any 64 bit PC. Big waste of money. It should be noted in the description."
4,What are you paying for,"Despite of the book ambicious objectives of being a compreensive guide to game project and programming techniques, there are some chapters(for example AI and Dead Reckoning alg) that are so valuable that one should consider investing his/her money on it!"
5,First book of many...,"I have been reading this series since this first book. I am about to purchase Game Programming Gems 5 because each book has given me so much incite to the many elements of game programming. You could easily take every one of these tips and gems and implement them not only in games but many systems that require optimization, graphics or sound programming.Hands down this series is the best format I have seen with regards to engineering books. The many authors contributing are industry experts and the hands on people who are doing the work. Even if you do not program games this is some great information for all software developers."
3,Gems among Coal,"There are some very good articles in this book, and there are also some bad ones. I strongly recommend flipping through a copy on the shelf on the articles that have caught your attention before you make a decision to buy.Some of the articles represent only introductions to concepts and won't be anything new if you already have a good text on the subject. It was my feeling most of the AI topics were this way."
5,Game Programming Review,This book is great. I have used it a lot. Very usefull. You will need it! :)
1,Not good Clarke,"I havnt disliked a Clarke book untill now. I was truly dissappointed by the brush off of the environmental and social problems of the 20th C in a single line. Everything was just too plastic, clean and lifeless."
3,Left me a bit unsatisfied,"Don't get me wrong, this is a decent read but after 2001 and 2010, I was a bit unsatisfied. It didn't seem to be a fitting end to such a great series of books."
2,A little dissapointing...,"3001 would probably have been allright as a stand-alone, but it read like Clarke didn't really have anything left to say about the monoliths. All through the book, I was thinking, ""OK, this is all interesting: all the future predictions and gadgets, but when do we get to the monolith?!?"" I really got interested when they discovered the monolith's plans, but nothing ever came of it. They had ONE meeting about it where they figured out how to solve the issue (trying not to give anything away to anyone who hasn't read it), Frank had ONE conversation with Dave and they implemented their solution. I thought the humans were going to get into a real good conflict with the monolith, but instead all I got was that weak spectacle at the end when the monolith was defeated. So basically, interesting view of the future, but Clarke seemed to be trying too hard to fit it into the 2001 series."
1,Lacking the complexity and imagination of first 3 odysseys,"Other Reveiw have given the basic story line so I will restrict myself to comments. The first three books steadily built up to a number of questions that failed to be answered or commented upon in this last and final book. Cheif among them was ""Who would inherit the galaxy--the humans or europeians?"" 2001, 2010, and 2061 all also showed clear thought logic and eccelent imagination built into it that 3001 lacked completely. In fact in my opinion he failed to live up to the expectations that his great writing in the past and build up especially in 2061 led us to believe was coming. Frankly I am terribly disapointed."
3,"Interesting Concept, but too slow!","Although Clarke has defined the genre of ""possible"" sci-fi, he lacked some of the general points that made 2061, 2010, and 2001 so popular. I didn't really like Frank Poole returning from the dead to live in the 22nd century, but I did like the ideas for future space exploration that Clarke gave. If you follow this series, I would recommend reading this book, because it is the ""full circle"" of Clarke's amazing series."
2,Disappointing....,"six years ago I was introduced into the world of science fiction. A friend lend me several Clarke books (Rama series, Childhood's End, and the first three Odyssey books). I loved the Odyssey books, although there were some inconsistencies, the serie in general was really good. For the next six years I waited to read the book that'll end this great series. Maybe the anticipation, made me hope for something better, but 3001: Final Odyssey was really disappointing. I expected something better with which the Odyssey series would bid farewell to the fans...."
2,Too much tecnical speculations and less action,It's the worst of the 2001-serie. First part of the book are only tecnical speculations and a few are very ridiculous. They seem to be in the year 2100 and not in 3001! The second part is low action. What happens with Clarke? Only for very hard fans of Clarke...
1,Ugggggggghhhh!,"3001 attempts to explain much of what has happened since 2001, a book whos' lack of explantation made it so popular to me.Mankind finds superior intellect in the universe and in this book we attempt to understand ""its'"" purpose. This is the last of a four book set, preceded by 2010 & 2061, books that shouldn't have been written. Over four books you finally reach a pinnacle, that does nothing more than disappoint. The ending is similar to Independence Day (the movie). Computer virus wins over are ancestral guides? Ughhh!It earns one star because it set up a great premise, but could not deliver."
2,Just barely OK,"I figure if you're a Clarke reader you come to his work tolerant of his short-comings as a writer: weak characterization and weak dialogue. You come to Clarke for his speculative ideas and interesting plots. 3001 begins well enough; the ideas are abundant and the plot builds, albeit, a bit slowly. There is a bit too much of revived Discovery astronaut Frank Poole's recovery time devoted to the minutiae of fourth millennia technology. When Poole finally gets back into space and pursues the continuing mystery of the monoliths the book really gets rolling. Unfortunately, and inexplicably, Clarke rushes the conclusion, and I believe undercuts the powerful image of the Monolith he has challenged our imaginations with from the beginning of the Odyssey series. The supposed conclusion to the series leaves readers more confused than ever and trivializes one of the most potent images in sci-fi lit. Very disappointing and unsatisfying. I wish he hadn't even made the attempt."
3,Clarke told us too much... still not completely horrible,"The most wonderful thing about 2001 was that there was so much we didn't know. It blew my mind. I enjoyed not knowing so much. In 2010, he didn't answer questions, he just continued the leagacy, also making it a great book (not quite as good as 2001 but still very good). In 2061, only few more questions were answered, making it okay but not great. But now... in 3001, Clarke has revealed the answers to these questions, almost ruining the classic 2001. Also, the fact that Frank Poole is still alive makes HAL seem less evil, which kind of defeats the point if you ask me. 2001 was great because we didn't know what the monoliths were, we didn't know who made them, and we didn't know about the future of David Bowman.However, in 3001, all these questions are given answers. In my opinion... I ENJOYED NOT KNOWING!"
3,3001 : A different focus on 2001,"3001 changes focus from the rest of the Odyssey series. TheFinal Odyssey focuses on the future much more than the Space Odysseyplot. That's to bad, because 3001's future isn't realistic. Plausible, but it sounds false and stale. Where 3001 bombs, however, is the plot. Not that 3001's plot is bad, but it's a square peg going into the round hole. It's ignoring and re-writing some of the better parts of the earlier three Odysseys. C'mon, bringing Frank Poole back to life? Independant from 2001, 2010, and 2061 this book actually does well, but fans like me are being deprived of a fittinig end to the Space Odyssey.Andrew Harris, harris@worthington.mn.frontiercomm.net"
3,Different than the other Odysseies,"Grumble, Grumble...I was intrigued by the statement on the backthat the book answered all the questions left unanswered by the firstthree books. While it did answer a couple of the nagging questions, this book was more like a three hundred page description of the future through the eyes of Arthur C. Clarke, without a lot of plot to carry it.I found 2061 much more satisfying as to be the ""end of the story""; that book clarified what happened to Dave Bowman, Hal, and Heywood Floyd.If you're looking for a great vision of the future, buy this up. If you're looking for the end of the story, ask a friend who's read the book."
2,An anticlimactic end to a great series,"Arthur C Clarke has produced some awesome works ofSF. Rendezvous with Rama, 2001 and Childhood's Endrank, in my opinion, with the best SF ever produced. This book is a major disappointment. There are a myriad of inconsistencies with the previous books of the series and the work reads more like a short story than a novel. Most of the key elements of the previous book have been discarded and some of the more trivial ones developed. As an optimistic speculation as to the state of the world in 3001 the book works well. As a novel it is rather poor. The Clarke fan would consider it substandard when compared to his other works while the casual reader would just find it dull. After the heights of 2001 the Odyssey series has come to a anticlimactic and perhaps even unimaginative end."
4,Cosmic Conclusion!,"A wonderful conclusion to one of sci-fi's cosmic chapters. Less sweeping than ""2001,"" but classic Clarke"
2,"Science - 10, fiction - 2","Arthur Clarke is a genius, and when he tells me what the future is going to be like in a thousand years or so, I pay attention. His future is minutely detailed, and will probably prove true in many respects. Where this novel fails is in a failure to couple the technological change with humanity. These people don't breathe and spit and snore; these are illustrations, not characters. The plot isn't really worth mentioning: there was only enough of it for a short story"
3,Not a great end to a great series,Lots of possibilities for the future but it is sort of flat. Never get any real action. Thevirus that was locked in a cave for hundreds of years seems a bit naive. Any good hacker could dothat. One thousand year old men could be made more exciting. No more sequels please.
2,It actually offended me.,"All right, the basic premise of this novel is just plain wrong. According to the speed of light, the Alien Overlords are just finding out what humanity is like and that maybe we are not that nice. Didn't Clarke read his own book. The speed of light can be gotten around. The aliens knew EXACTLY what we were like right from the start! His vision of the ring around Earth is kind of cool, and the best thing about this book.It needs to be said that Clarke's condescending comments about religion and religious people are so callow and insulting that I lost much of the respect I had for him. I now assess most of the credit for 2001 to Stanley Kubrick. Judging by this book, the aliens were wasting their time putting the monolith on Earth."
2,A major disappointment from an old master.,"Clarke establishes a lot of fascinating concepts and goes about describing them in an interesting manner. But overall the novel is very short on plot. You are left with the feeling that he set out to write an epic, but got tired, thinned it out, and ended it quickly. Also, the bringing-back-to-life of Poole- with intact memory and mental faculties- is not very believable."
1,Massive Dissapointment for a Great Series,I read each of the books in the series and eagerly anticipated this final work. Never have I been more dissapointed in an ending than this book. I have to wonder what writing is left in Arthur. Very sad.
2,"bad, very bad","When I heard that mr Clarke had written the fourth book in the series, I thought it was something special, you know, a great adventure that would make me loose my breath or something, almost like 2001. My mistake. It was boring"
2,Ideas running out !!!,"After I read 2061, it already gave me an impression that Arthur C. Clarke has ran out of ideas for this series and 3001 confirmed my feeling. I am sorry but I seriously deem that this book has spoiled the reputation of 2001 and 2010. He should have stopped at 2061.p.s. the worst part of the book is the ending,it's too sloppy.How can the computer virus created by the human beings be able to damage the ""Frist Born"" 's ""computers"", I don't think they use the same computer language as us."
1,"Uninteresting, carelessly written garbage","SPOILER: THERE IS NO ENDING. The book suddenly stops in its tracks. I had to re-read the final chapter and check the PAGE NUMBERS to see if the publisher had left out the ending by accident.It's as if Mr. Clarke lost interest in this awful piece of fluff about three pages into the story -- if story is the right word --and continued to write, grudgingly, in order to pay his mortgage.Yes, he's brilliant, and he's written some classic fiction and non-fiction, but he was so disintrested in his own story that the magic, the mystery, the grandeur of the next (or, previous) thousand years is glossed over without any thought about entertaining the reader.If you haven't read this book yet -- don't. Go find a 30-year-old Larry Niven book, curl up and enjoy the next thousand years written by an author who gave a damn."
1,A tragic failure that should not have been allowed to happen,"I *love* AC Clarke, and I love his short stories and novels, especially the 2001 series. However, this is a bad book -- a failure that should not have been allowed to happen. He starts out really well -- Frank Poole, alive, as a vehicle to explore the future. Great! But there is no story, no mystry, nothing but a few admitedly neat ideas about the future (love the towers) and nothing else. Skip this book, and check out the Red Mars series instead."
4,Remember...,"Just a note to you who compare 3001 to 2001. Clarke based the last 3 books of the series off the movie, not the book. That's where Jupiter comes into play."
3,"An enjoyable book made more fun by Clarke's ""prophecies"".","""3001"" wraps up the plot lines of the previous three works inthis series spanning one thousand years. Mr. Clarke reports on thedevelopements not only in space science and technology but also in other fields including health science, theology and international (and inter-planet!) relations. He includes delightful footnotes to document his science inspirations.I read science ficition for fun, and Arthur C. Clarke is one of my favorite writers. When I learned of ""3001"" I realized I'd not read any in this series since ""2001"". I checked out ""2010"" and ""2061"" from the library so I could get to ""3001"" in the proper sequence. While ""3001"" could be read alone, I think readers' enjoyment will be enhanced by reading the other three first."
1,Where's the story?,"""Arthur C. Clarke is considered the greatest science fiction writer of all time,"" says the publisher's blurb. By who? _3001_ contains maybe 25 pages' worth of story (though ""story"" is putting it too strongly), padded out to ten times that length by self-indulgent prophesying and preaching, in amateurish prose that makes you cringe several times per page. And when, after 150 pages of this padding, we finally get to the actual story, Clarke fails to provide us with the most important and potentially interesting part of it, the actual message whose warning of impending disaster finally sets the real plot in motion. Ironically, the best writing and reading come in the nonfictional source notes and valediction at the end of the book. For addicts only, and they might want to wait for the cheaper paperback edition, which surely won't be long in coming"
3,"Good book, bad ending","The story in itself is not all that bad. The ideas about religion were all too true, and I agree totally about communism being the most perfect form of government. However, with all the exciting developments of the story through the series, this book's ending is a let-down. I expected something a little better than a ""Trojan Horse"" solution. At least he didn't drag it on..."
3,"Interesting conclusion to the series, a bit light on plot.","I agree with some of the other reviews which claims that the plot is pretty light--almost non-existent. However, I rather liked the book, his treatment of religion is worth the price by itself. The technological details were pretty fascinating, as usual, but overall I guess I'd have to say 2061 made a better ending to the 2001 series. If I look at 3001 as a stand-alone book, it seems much more fulfilling."
2,Lacks the real science---and the sound thinking---we expect,"Generally pretty lame, although the idea it takes off from is kind of fun--the recovery and resuscitation of astronaut Frank Poole, whose body had been flash-frozen one thousand years before. ----- For me the book was particularly marred by one of the silliest popular misconceptions current, namely that religion is responsible for most of the world's suffering. The two great causes of persecution in this century have been atheism (particularly under the former Soviet Union and its vassal states) and racism (under the Thousand Year Reich, during its decade or so under the sun). Also ripe for blame are political ideology and territorial ambition. Clearly, something else is happening--call it man's inhumanity to man. It doesn't seem reasonable to blame religion for a common human failing. ----- Arthur C. Clarke is a fine thinker when he sticks to his area of expertise. His book on the terraforming of Mars is wonderful. This one is a duck."
1,worst book ever written,"Whenever people around me are talking about bad books, I bring this one up and say that it is the worst book ever written. Still not convinced that it's bad? Consider this. I'm an Arthur C. Clarke fan!!!"
1,Nice try at reliving the glory days,"I found this book too far fetched, even for the grand imagination that I have. The plot was too focused on the human aspects of Frank Poole and not focused enough on the thing that made the 2000 series great -- the monolith. It seems to me that Clarke expended too much energy on introspection and human drama. The fabricated plot surrounding the Monolith seems like it was put in there to give a semblance of credibility to the fact that this story really shouldn't take place. All in all a disappointment."
4,An intriguing and thought provoking novel. Excellent work.,"Although the actual plot left something to be desired, I consider this an excellent book. Clarke's main purpose was, I believe, not to entertain but to question. If you really read it and went between the lines, you will notice the remarks about today's society. But Clarke couldn't write a whole book just about that. He had to involve some plot to it, and decided that the Space Odyssey series was the best suited. If you loved the rest of the series, and if you like thought provoking works, I highly reccomend this book."
4,"Not up to Clarke's usualy standards, but still fun","While 3001 isn't as good as 2010 and 2061, it is still a good story. It is slower and less action packed then previous books in the series, but it is a nice conclusion to the series. Don't be daunted by the bad reviews. It was well worth reading. Clarke also manages to slip in a lot of nods to various other SciFi authors, a nice touch that almost makes the book worth reading by itself. Definately a should-read."
1,Should have stopped at 3,"I was very disappointed with the story as it unfolded. As some of the other reviews have indicated it started with promise and then quickly died. Mr Clarke did not bother with even an attempt to conceal his loathing of religion nor his apparent view that Socialism is the best form of government (obviously he has never read Frederick C. Hayak's ""Road to Serfdom""). I kept waiting for the story to break out into something worthy of the series but instead found myself at end asking ""Is this it?!"" He should of stopped at the 3rd book or at least waited until he had some inspiration."
4,Clarke's imagination is pure science and it shows in 3001,"In 3001 the missing element is extra-scientific imagination in the form of real drama. Like the Rama series, there is wealth of plausible scientific innovation from a futurist perspective in the 2001 series, but little in the way of real imagination of the human kind. Nonetheless, I read Clarke with this caveat in mind and he never disappoints me. As expected, Clarke's world of 3001 is the innovative environment that we have come to expect from a futurist thinker, but to describe his world, he inserts some unrelated incidents that simply serve as a vehicle to describe innovation. I did enjoy the innovations of the third millenium and look forward to Clarke's futurist research prospectus."
1,Was ACC in a rush to get somewhere?,"This book, no rather collection of pages, was awful. Where is the plot, where is the imagination? By the time I finished I felt that ACC had an appointment that afternoon and quickly finished the book so as not to miss his engagement. However, to the books credit, since it did nothing to stimulate my gray matter, I did sleep very well as it slipped out of my hands."
3,I thought it was o.k...........i guess,"Well, i have to agree with almost everyone, it did not have an apparent plot, nor did it really have anything to do with the first 2 or 3, and it also did not show any signs of a real story line until about 170 pages into it, and even then it was short lived. I honestly think this book might have been better if it did not have anything to do with the odyssey series, if it was all alone, and had some of the things relating to the first three taken out it would have been a really good book, and that's why i have rated it a 6, cuz it sux as a sequel but alone it's pretty cool."
2,Sad end to a wonderful series.,"While I have not read the entire novel, I have read the excerpt published several months ago in Playboy. I must say that, unfortunately, even this brief taste of 3001 was bitter. It failed to interest me. I also didn't accept the fact that Poole could have survived in space for a millenium. At least I'll always have 2001 to revisit."
3,A good story but a sad plot,"The book was a good read but it had no plot, It was just a continuation of the series of the monoliths. I Think it would have been better if Clarke had concerntrated more on the monoliths and ""hal-man"", (Shouldn't it have been Hal-Dave-Hayewood?). Poole was a good addition to the series be ressurected. If he had not been there I would have felt that the only connection between all the books (and in some cases movies) was Hal, Dave and the monoliths. Unfortunately the ending left a window to create 4001 (a space story gone too far). Hopefully it will have more from the beginnings of the series"
1,What a mess....,"Now what?...3001 makes it clear that Clarke is writing onreputation alone now. The story does nothing to further the ""adventures"" of HAL and Bowman--just the inflated ego of the author. Clarke has managed to give us no answers, while leaving the story no where to go. Incredible..."
3,I'm a bit disturbed...,"I thought 3001 was two things: a mediocre (and somewhatsummary) stand-alone story, and a lousy ending to the Odyssey saga.Quite frankly, the best-written part of the book was the Epilogue, which consisted of three or four lines.The thing that really made me mad, though, was Clarke's arrogant dismissal of religion as an ""un-sane"" (sic) psychopathology. Oh, really? Well, I'm sure that millions of readers who do go to church (or a synagogue, or a mosque, or whatever) will be extremely pleased to hear THAT!The bottom line: wait for the paperback.ACC"
3,"An OK story, not very exciting, but pretty good.","Just an OK story, it didn't fire my imagination like ""2001 Space Odessey"" did. I like the main character, it's just that this kind of story needs to be seen on the big screen, not in a book format.!"
3,A bit of a let down compared to the rest,"I really loved 2001. And the next two were very good, but this conclusion did not have the same appeal to me. It did have its moments of brilliance but they were few and far in between. It did not spark the imagination they way I expected. It was almost as if it was written by a different author. I guess I had too high os standards after being so blown away by 2001."
3,An Average Conclusion,"In 3001 the body of a lost voyager from the spacecraft in 2001 is found drifting in the outer solar stysem. Modern science is able to revive him making Frank an interesting visitor from the past. Along with having to adjust to the culture, Frank learns of the history behind the missions in 2001, 2010, and 2061. He finds many questions are left unanswered and he can help write another chapter in the oddysey to find the true meaning of the black monoliths."
3,Read for predictions only,"The only reason to read this book is to see Clarke's science predictions for the next 1000 years, which are very interesting. Also of interest are the notes at the back of the book, where Clarke expands on some of the technology he's describing in each chapter. Clarke has never been a great charactor developer, but the 1-dimensional portrayal of Frank Poole is really disappointing. Clarke throws in a paragraph about how Poole suddenly realizes that he'll never see his dog or his brother (in that order) again, but otherwise, Poole is completely (and unbelievably) well adjusted after his 1000-year sleep. The story in the second half about the monoliths and Dave builds nicely with suspense, but the ending is quick, easy, and 1-dimensional. This book is quite short. It's a real shame Clarke didn't spend more time on it to double the legnth to put some flesh on it and come up with a more thoughtful ending."
3,Almost a Let Down,"After reading the 2010 and 2061 just so I can finally figure out the whole story behind the monolith, I finally get to read 3001. It is true what you hear about the book it is not exactly up to Par with 2001 or 2010. It is a very interesting story and takes the word Fiction in Science Fiction to a whole new level, at times I feel that ACC view of the future 1000 years into the future to be almost simple. We find the year 3001 technology not that far ahead of the technology in 2061. If the advancements made in technology during the later half of the 20th century, then I am sure that even if it slows down that we should be much farther ahead of what ACC has us at in 3001. This really isn't a big deal, other then the fact that 2001 and 2010 were drastically much further advanced then we are currently at, so therefore that alternate reality must have a drastic decline in intelligence in the last 9 centuries."
3,Good Ending,"Their were enough revelations, technologies and other discovery's to save this ending. I especially liked the return of Poole, a character who hasn't been heard from since 2001, and in that he had a small part. But by the fourth book, the story was getting a little dull."
2,There's no heart here.,"What I hated about this book was that it had Frank Poole as a protaganist, a character we barely remember. 2001 was the best book in the series. It explaiend things better than the movie, but not so much that ruined it. 2061 was the most boring and this book is tyed with 2010. I also hated how the characters on Earth and Ganymede were able to figure out what happened to Bowman. I liked it better when it was big mystery. This book is also self contradicting. During the prolouge at the begining it says the firstborn came years ago and left never planning to come back but leaving their monoliths to do the rest. But in the epilouge they say they plan to come back at the end of time. Without a doubt 2001 was the best."
1,Oh brother...,"After reading 2061, I had a nagging feeling that AC Clarke was going insane. Well, 3001 confims it beyond a doubt. It's sad to see an author slowly lose his skill and interest. If this were submitted for publication by a lesser-known author, it would have gone straight into the trash."
2,"Good concept, but never seems to develope","The mystery of the monolith, being so cryptic and strange, is an exceptionally good concept for a science fiction plot. After all, everyone whoever saw 2001 wonders at times about the monolith.Sadly though, it seems that the author never really figured out how to develope this idea and ended up just dragging it out through 4 books.This sort of was an obvious let down for readers.I also felt that the series was more devoted to his idea of the future and the universe than delivering a real storyline. The storyline was merely used as tool to express his quite fasinating image of the future to the reader.I must admit, the fourth book is a bit predictable. He needed to finish off the series and was only capable of thinking up a medicore climax."
2,"Not a ""Scientific"" science fiction","I love most of Clarke's works but this book actually drives me mad! If I did not know him, I would guess he did never saw a computer even from distance! How he did even imagined using a computer virus, 1000 years after it's creation on an alien computer? I really did not expect that from a world class SF writer. I think that flaw realy spoils the experience...."
2,disappointing,"This book gets 2 stars only because I was able to finish it, not because of its content. It does not compare to the literary quality of the first 2 books in the series. Good science fiction should be both imaginative in its exploration of the future and intellectually stimulating in its exploration of ethical dilemmas. This book is neither. There was only one lame chapter toward the end of the book that dealt with the religion issue and how 31st century science had impacted it. And what happened to Frank when he landed on Europa and was supposedly reunited with Dave after a millenia? And Hal, the epitome and representation of evil, now a ""good guy"" or at least benevolent? I agree with the other reviewers that said some things should be left to the imagination and that this book should be read only to complete the series.By the way, someone who has been writing for as long as Clarke has should not misuse the word ""myriad"" as often as he does."
3,Critique,"First, Clarke does not even know when a millennium begins. His would begin Jan. 1, 3001, but he thinks it begins a year earlier. A lot of his scientific thinking has been outdated by now (2003). It is interesting, but a bit scientifically sophomoric.-F.M. Sturtevant, Ph.D."
2,Letdown of massive proportions!,"3001 was a letdown. I had been looking forward to this book ever since I finished 2061. I finished the book and basically said ""That's it?"" I'll admit that some points in the book are very flavorful, but they are not used to their potential. It's as if this was a bit rushed and background was kept at a premium. I guess the Odyssey went in like a lion and out like a lamb."
1,3001: Just Say NO!,"If anyone suggests you read this book, just say NO! Why? How about: NO plot, NO characterization, NO answers, NO drama, NO tension, and above all:NO sense of wonder! Of all the books I would have loved to see convey a sense of wonder over the mysteries of the universe, this would be it. A very disappointing Cincinnati-to-San-Francisco-on-Delta read"
2,Waste of time and money!,"The odysey series takes its final downhill twist.This plot is hardly sufficient for a short story, the characters areshallow and there is no human conflict to be found. Besides the inertialess drive there is no any other idea in the book to bite into, and this morsel by itself is far too tiny and irrelevant to the story to carry the weight of this too long and boring book.Judging by past performance Mr. Clarke certainly knows how to produce better reading than that.The grade is not lower only due to the appendix which tries to justify the fiction by science."
1,Clarke has only one ability...,"...to ruin a good book. I'll take two examples: ""2001"" and ""Rendezvous with Rama"" - two great books destroyed with mediocre sequels.I won't comment much about 3001, because everything is said by those 200 reviewers. I just want to say that not seeing Independace Day is not really an excuse for Clarke. Take a look at ""Invasion"",""The Puppet Master"",""War of the worlds"", and many other alien invasion movies, and you'll see that almost every time the aliens are destroyed by a virus(biological or computer, it doesn't matter, it's still a virus). Everyone who has read the previous books would expext the similar kind of enigmatic conclusion, where not everything is revealed, and the reader could be left wondering about some higher intellegence out there, and we could get some idea from the book. Here everything is revealed in the most terrible way the author could have thought of, so he ruined everything that he built in the previous books, even in 2061..."
1,Booooooooring!,"I've been a fan of Clarke for decades, but this book is the least exciting, least interesting, least everything he has ever done. The story is mundane and predictable and without any of the facination that held my interest in earlier books. This book opens at a low level of interest and maintains it throughout.Clarke uses this book as a soapbox for insulting anyone of faith (calling them ""Un-Sane""). After his last few books I swore I would not read anything else he published - I should have kept my word.There are many better ways to spend your time than to read this book - trimming your nails, waiting in line for a movie, and going to the dentist are just a few."
2,Too simple,"This is the last part of the story and it could have been the most interesting one but we can recognize there ideas from other fiction sources. The first 2/3 of the book is boring. It's too descriptive. Clarck tries to describe a world at 3001 based in theoretical physics of today, we don't know if could be ever possible, and when action starts it's too simple, no suspense. And the final comfrontation to the monolith has been taken from a recent commercial movie of the 90's."
1,Damp Squib,"A boring book by an author held in esteem by many. This was my first of Clarkes books but it does no justice to his name and fame. The book is dull, monotonous, ungripping and only the last 50 pages provide some excitement. Clarke playes around with his imagination creating space cities and theroies on present day institutions which irritate beyond words. If u havent read it then - DONT. Unless u have no worse way to waste your time."
5,THE ODYSSEY CONCLUDES!,"The final installment of Arthur C. Clarke's ""Odyssey"" quartet, ""3001: the Final Odyssey"" features the return of Frank Poole, a fascinating look at what life could be like in the 31st century, and final answers to some of the most asked questions in the history of science-fiction.While it lacks an even-flow to the narrative (even more so than ""2061: Odyssey Three), it is still a wonderful tale full of mystery, beauty, wonder, and terror. Fans of the other novels will not want to miss this one.""3001: The Final Odyssey"" is a great read, and an outstanding finale to one of the greatest science-fiction series ever written! Grade: A-"
1,Not With a Bang but a Whimper...,"I just finished this novel and was stunned that it was over...I kept waiting for something to happen and all of the sudden I was left looking at credits and commentary by Clarke.I agree with others that this book should never have been published. I disagree that there is anything really interesting in it. None of the ideas are new, and most have been presented better in other books. The fact that it shares something with the movie ""Independence Day"" should be an indication that it isn't very good.The story just plods along with no real focus or reason for being until near the end and then the solution is so matter of fact, and trivial that it just sucks the life out of the Odyssey series.I would recommend passing on this book."
1,Painfully Bad,This is probably the worst book I have read. The book lacks imagination and the characters have no substance. For such a brilliant start of a series 2001 the ending was so bad it is indescribably bad and predicable.
1,"Oh man, hold your nose!","ACC should have stopped at 2001, a truly great read from one of the best movies of all time. Each book in the series went down from there. This one doesn't even deserve one star! It sucked so hard that I read it in one sitting, since I knew I would never come back to it if I put it down. It is horrendous, no lie!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Monolith mankind murder, with Poole.Frank Poole's body is rediscovered and presumably frozen enough for 31st century technology to revive ok, and this happens.Not so great is the discovery that the monoliths want to get rid of those pesky humans, so a defense is mounted to try and prevent this.What will confused readers of this series is the inconsistencies between all the books - monoliths here in this book, but not in that one, in this book they can travel like this, in the other, no. This is all presumably deliberate on the part of the author."
2,Cardboard cut-out characters that are little Arthur Clarkes,A thinly veiled tirade and anti-religious editorial filled with smug elitism. Mr Clarke has forgotten that we expect a story when we buy a novel.
2,Unbelievably dull and unimaginative,"I can't believe that the same author wrote the previous books of the Odyssey series! 3001 was a weak speculation of the future, Clarke's rendition dull and unimaginative -- merely excerpts of other literature of our time (""Jurassic Park"" and ""Cult at the end of the World"" for example). It was almost as if Mr. Clarke was forced to write this book! I was completely disappointed and barely made it to the end (I couldn't finish 2061). I probably should have stopped reading his books after reaching puberty."
1,"If you saw Independence Day, you know the plot of this book!","I had to force myself to finish this book. It was plotless, predictable, had lifeless characters, and frankly I wish I'd never bought it. There were way too many dumb references to ""quaint"" twentieth century things (ie, one character -- who was born in the thirtieth century, no less -- had to explain that there were no ""Star Trek transporters."" Plus there was a plethora of bad cliches being used, because, predictably, the female love interest was a historian who just happened to specialize in Poole's era). ARGH! It hurt my brain to read this book! Save yourself the bother -- if you absolutely have to read it, just check it out at the library. At least that way you don't have anything invested in it and you can put it down without feeling like you wasted your money."
2,The 'Windows '95' of the Oddessy series,"Well. uhmn. Touted, lots of anticipation based on reputation. Like climbing into a Mazzerratti (sp) And discovering it has a salvaged 1967 VW Bug engine. Best things to say here are 1) Technologically, interesting. 2) Didn't suck. Not completely at least. In my uninformed opinion, ACC is tired, and may well have been pressured into this by his adoring public. In my mind, where there is an afterlife in which you are free to roam the cosmos and time at will, and all things are known, all answers revealed, this final oddessy will become more palatable."
2,A GOOD BOOK GONE BAD,"I picked up this book for a good price and just because i knew the author was a good one. I can't say that i've read his other novels, but i hear he can do better. As it started I was intrigued and read the first hundred pages non-stop. It portrayed in good and facinating detail the ways of life and the culture shock that Poole tried to avoid in 3001. As i read i became less interrested, but kept reading hoping that since the beginning was excellent that it would end w/ a bang. I was sourly dissappointed at a boring and mildly eventful ending For the diehard Clarke fan its a must, though dissappointing, I wouldn't reccomend this to anyone as a first impression of good Sci-fi."
2,HO! HUM!!!! JUST LIKE 2061,"Prepare to be disappointed again. 2010 was science fiction at its finest. It was passionate, intriguing, and left me breathless for more.2061 was not very good and neither is this one.Clarke seems to have lost his interest in this story and wanted to just shrug it off like a coat no longer needed or wanted' The book is short and has a large font, as well as copies of previously released chapters. The only remotely interesting thing is Clarke's portrayal of future gadgets. But that does not save it from being a big waste of money and very little time!!!!!"
1,So that's it?????,"This book was twice as useless as 2061. It is a good short story that never makes it as a novel. As usual, Clarke uses the story to publish his predictions for the future, but with this book that's about all you get. The poorly developed characters elicit no empathy from this reader, and the plot is only ankle-deep. I kept thinking that sooner or later it would have to get interesting when I realized I was three quarters of the way through to the rushed and wow-less ending. I read this book only to finish out the series. Odyssey 2: 2010 left me wanting more. And while Odyssey 3 was rather lackluster, 3001 is contrived and downright juvenile in story development. Read the Epilogue from 2010 and consider that the end of the story because you will find no new revelations or answers here."
1,Atrocious,"This would have to be one of the worst books I have ever read. It lacks imagination, which is the backbone of all good science fiction books. The book starts slow and is predictable all the way through. The only exception to this is to believe that dinosaurs are recreated, via cloning, to be domesticated servants.This book lacked intrigue, suspense and the dramatic finish that the initial concept of 2001 offered. The characters lack substance and the dialogue between characters was at the level of young children.Here is a typical passage: Do I detect a hint of sarcasm? Thanks to our computers, we can run political experiments in cyberspace before trying them out in practice. Lenin was unlucky: he was born a hundred years too soon. Russian communism might have worked - at least for a while- if it had microchips.Revetting stuff isn't it?This would have to be the low point in the series and I doubt whether there is a lower point for it to go."
2,Disappointing finale,"Bringing Frank Poole back from the dead was a good idea, but I wish Clarke had developed his character better (or at all, for that matter). Since character is not his strong point, he'd better have some damn interesting ideas, but unfortunately those are not present either. Much of the plot consists of Poole wandering from point A to point B and talking with various individuals about various subjects; this gives Clarke an opportunity to vent on selected topics, but doesn't make for interesting reading. I could forgive a slow beginning if the end came through, but Clarke inexplicably elects to reprint chapters from previous books. I didn't expect this last book to live up to the previous ones, but what a disappointment."
2,Have I missed something?,"I have read this book several times now and still feel like I have missed something. I really do think Mr Clarke was fighting a deadline to get this one out. It has so much potential to draw you in but never quite gets you going like the other three... 2001, 2010 and 2061 (mind you even 2061 was showing signs of sagging towards the end). The four Rama books were brilliant from the very first word to the very last as are many of his other sci-fi stories and the Rama series truly is a classic. The 2001 saga should be up there with the classics but I don't think it ever can be with the results of 3001. This is disappointing because it all starts out so well and 3001 isn't a bad read as far as books go but it certainly is not worthy as the final word in this much vaunted series."
1,A sad and bitter end to Clarke's visionary career,"Having grown up reading Arthur C. Clarke books, I was expecting to be challenged and intrigued anew by the genious behind 2001, Rendezvous with Rama and Songs of Distant Earth. 3001: The Final Odyssey is proof of the horrible decline in his faculties. He seems more concerned with pontificating on the wisdom of his past positions (like the Millennium falling on 2001) than on developing any new ideas. This book managed to ruin my appreciation for the earlier books in the series. I cling to the hope that Clarke is actually too infirm to write and 3001 was ghost-authored by some well-meaning but untalented assistant. As the saying goes, I am less enlightened for having read it."
2,3001: A depressing odyssey,"Oh God, Arthur! Why why why! Why did you have to write this book? It was flat, unimaginative, and a complete waste of my time as a science fiction reader/fanatic. If it weren't for some basic information that led you back to the series I would have given this book one star. But I gave it two because it looked so pathetic setting next to its predecessors on my bookshelf. Thank god its over! Try the Dune series or Foundation series or Lord of the Ring series if you want true reading material."
1,Just like 2061-totally unnecessary,"When I first saw the adverising for this book it said ""what really happened to Dave Bowman and HAL, and what are those monoliths?"". But all those things were explained in 2010, so there was no need for any more sequels.In 2061 nothing really happened, but at least it was an odyssey (because odyssey means a long journey, like the journeys in the first three books). 3001 is not an odyssey at all. Poole just hangs around on Earth most of the time, then he makes a quick travel to Jupiter's moons (which takes about two pages of the book, and therefore it's not an odyssey), and then the stupid ending takes place.All the inconsistencies and bunch of other very stupid stuff are explained by most of the other reviewers, so I'm just gonna say that just like 2061, this one is totally unnecesarry, and is obviously made just for money.Stick to the first two books, and also see the two movies. You don't need anything else."
2,gobble gobble,"This turkey shouldn't have been written. Flat, stale, unprofitable to read, and with a totally lame ending that leaves the reader unsatisfied. That it was written by Arthur Clarke makes it even more disappointing."
2,Interesting but not too entertaining,"3001: The Final Odyssey is really a strange book. It has the general form of a novel, but it really doesn't have much of a plot. It mainly seems to be an excuse for Arthur C. Clarke to hypothesize about what life and the Earth will be like in another thousand years. Some of his ideas are very interesting, and they all seem to be firmly rooted in ""science fact"", but I was still kind of disappointed with this book. The characters were flat and there wasn't really a plot. I would recommend this book only for the novelty value of the futuristic settings and people. As far as novels go, it was pretty poor, and many people who read the first three books of the series will be disappointed."
2,Final? Odyssey,"I found the imagery in this book to be extremely awe inspiring. Clarke's vision of the future is a masterful one. And I like the quotes about how technology seems magical to those of the past. Reminds me of my parents. Overall however, i found the plot lacking. The explanation of Poole's return is vastly unbelievable. If you can get past that, the plot is very slow and cursory, and the ending leaves a lot to be desired. It kind of leaves you hanging out there, wondering if he's going to do another sequel, or did he just run out of ideas? If you're a fan, it's worth the read though for the imagery alone."
2,"Great view of tomorrow, but poor to the series...","Author Arther C. Clarke exhibits a wonderfuly vivid look into tomorrow with outstanding concepts and ideas that when really given the time to think about, make sense. However, I believe Mr. Clarke looses track of the story many times, and when he finaly gets back to the point he tries to make, he does it in a quick like gesture. Overal, a disapointing book to end the ""Odyssy"" series, but a marvelous look into the third millineum."
3,"Ok, but could have done better!","The book was ok but, lets just say, it will never ever be made into a movie. Its interesting looking into the technology that will be here 1000 years from now but the book only gives us slight insights into how earth's society has evolved for the better. That's where Star Trek does a much better job. The ending is not really an ending to the series."
1,A Well-Written Didactic Sermon,"Communism would have succeeded but for a lack of money. Mankind is ultimately self-destructive.If you want this sermon one more time, read this book."
3,Not that bad,"After reading the negative reviews I really expected the worst, but I wanted to finish the series, so I bought this book, and I can say that it comes nowhere near to 2001. That doesn't mean that it is that bad as most of the reviewers describe it.I too was disappointed by those inconsistencies that bug everyone, but I accepted Clarke's explanation that the sequels to 2001 are variations on the same theme, not necessarily happening in the same universe.Overall it's OK, and as one of the reviewers described it: ""it costs less than a movie and is better than most of what's out there on film"". It really does."
4,A grate conclusion to the Odyssey series,This has to be one of the best books I have read. I was grately dissapointed with the ending of 3001 it was an easy solution for the human race to get rid of the Monoliths whith a simple computer virus. One of the risons I gave this book 4 stars was not the plot but the way it shows our distance future. I was so glad that 3001 stayed away form Star Trek as much as possibel. I reccomend this book is you have read 2001 & 2010 but you will be a bit dissapointed with the plot of 3001 if you have read 2061 becouse 3001 plot dosent follow its predisesor 2061. You should also read 3001 if you havent read any of the previous Odyssey books becouse it's a goob stand alone book too.
1,No character development,"I expected better coming from Clarke... I was sorely disappointed. There seemed to be a total lack of character development. I've seen better development in short stories. I only paid $4 for the paperback edition, but I do not believe it was even worth this amount. I wonder if it would have even been possible to get this one published if it had not been with Clarke as the author. If this is an indication of how his abilities have slumped in his later years, I believe that it is time for him to give up writing and take up gardening. If you are a Clarke fan, you will have to read it solely because it was written by him, but don't expect too much... Borrow the book so that you don't waste any money on it..."
2,Why Didn't Clarke Just Let Well Enough Alone,"2001, 2010, and 2061 were all great books. 3001 however, wasn't good enough of the title Odyssey. Frank Poole's a likeable guy and the first part of the novel is great. The rest is all and all bad. Clarke is a great author. It's almost impossible to think that this novel is his."
1,"Be sad, be very very sad.","It was with great anticipation that I picked up the book from the library after having reserved it. I was looking forward to a typical AC Clarke novel of imagination, excellent writing, futuristic imagery, etc.(AC Clarke readers know the rest) I was shocked, disapointed, dismayed and angry. I was angry at ACC for allowing a book of this importance to be written as if a team of 12 year- olds had assembled for a writing assignment. No, I take that back, 12 year olds have more imagination than is evident in 3001. I suppose the thing that angered me the most was the writing style. It was flat, with little use of imagery, and did not evoke any emotion or wonder. I am very sad. This should have been a glorious culmination of a series. Instead it is a waste of our dwindling forest resources."
3,Pennies from heaven,"If you are expecting a big payoff from 3001, you'll be shortchanged. This book does have an audience however---10 to 14 year old kids with an active imagination. This is not meant as a put down. 3001 is just the kind of book that stirs the pot of an enthusiastic youngster. My suggestion to adults is to read the book, give it to a young person and then have a dialog with them exploring facets and implications of the book. That is when the fun will begin, and you may be in for a few surprises that even Arthur Clarke wouldn't think of."
2,"Not a sequel, not independent, not a good read","If you are a Clarke fan, if you do not know much about computer viruses (virii?), if you like short-short chapters with not much material on them, and if you are willing to forget ""2061: Odissey Three"" ever existed, THEN you may like 3001.The comments regarding computer viruses are ludicrous (locking them up in a vault so they cannot infect anything? burning a robot which handled such a virus in order to disinfect him?). Forgetting all what happened in 2061 --which has become a non-entity-- is not justifiable. The link between Bowman, Hal and Floyd in order to solve the problem of Lucifer's extinction looked interesting... but it's no more. Furthermore, there is something illogical going there. Much of the novel hinges on the problems of FTL (Faster Than Light) travel and information sent out to a place 450 light years away but the Monolith was a sort of star gate which allowed FTL travel, so why the delay?"
2,3001 - What an Odyssey Story,"Hmmm. Clarke is probably one of the best writers this century in any genre. However I have to ask - did he really write it or was it ghost written? I quite enjoyed the overall read but the book didn't hang together well. As for the end, I turned the page for the next chapter to be confronted by no more story! It was as if Arthur suddenly got bored and just stopped!2001 was excellent, 2010 and 2061 were both innovative and well written, this however quite frankly is very poor, and better he should have not written it than given us this. Maybe I'm too harsh, but we have come to expect from Clarke a certain imagination that allows us to believe in what he says. It's not coincidence that much of what he predicts happens as those inventors probably read Clarke as boys, and were spured on by their own imagination and Clarkes belief.Sorry but this only gets a 3 out of deference to all his past unsurpassable works."
1,someone kill me!!!!,"I love Clarke, BUT this was one of the worst books I've ever read. It added nothing to the series. The characters are flat. Ofcourse this is sci-fi; that can be excused. Whtat can't is that Clarke seems to have spontaneously become scientifically ignorant and uncreative. Ex. dinosaurs reconstructed from dna are used as gardeners in the future. No, I don't mean they trim the grass by eating it; I mean they use hedgeclippers. Yes, that is really in the book. The only reason that I didn't give it a 1 is because the epilouge in which he dicusses some scientific principles is very good."
3,Disjointed addition to the classic series...,"Some of the scenery was very well depicted, but on the whole I found the latest iteration of the 2001 series disappointing.There was little of Clark's characteristic technological speculation, despite the huge opportunity the setting offere. In fact this was eclipsed by the novel's sociological crystal ball gazing, which was actually a high point that could have been further developed. The lack of scientific depth was worsened by annoying references to popular science and (worse) culture from our times...In addition the formidable alien devices and transhuman protagonists he had built up in the first two books were somewhat cheapened in this novel, which was far too short.Still, it wasn't as bad as 2063 and I'll be first in line for 4001 when the time comes..."
2,Not Clarke's best!,"Arthur Clarke will go down in history as one of the best science fiction writers of all time. Unfortunately, this book is not worthy of him. He wrote it in just one month, and it reads like it. It's hardly well thought through, and falls flat on the mind. Stick with his earlier works."
2,Mr. Clarke apparently didn't read his other books...,"I'm sorry, but I was very disappointed with this effort.It was interesting to resurrect Frank Pool and explore his point of view...but it just didn't develop. While Mr. Clarke did plagerize himself somewhat, he seemed to have missed the path(s) he took in the previous books.What happened to Heywood Floyd?? I had such hopes after 2061, that we'd get to learn what was really going on. I can't believe in the future as foretold in 3001. Humans are far to self-important and conceited to not go after the bad guys...Stop reading now, if you're going to read the book.The ending is every bit as plausible as the Independence Day movie. You know, where the computer geek can log his PowerMac onto the Alien's computer and then upload a virus that crashes their system. Yeah. Right.I'm sorry Mr. Clarke, it just doesn't work this time.Thank you!"
2,Great author in decline is sad to see...,"While I read all the Sci-Fi giants as a teenager, Clarke was myfavorite. His early collections were some of the best Sci-Fi everdone. So it was a great disappointment reading 3001, to see how far he has fallen. 3001 seemed to be vehicle for Clarke to trot all of his ""inventions"", such as the space elevator/orbital ring, exploration of the solar system, and various colonies throughout the solar system. I did like the bringing back of Frank Poole, but having the artifact of a race a million years ahead of laid low by a computer virus? Preposterous! The book was at best anticlimatic, almost none of the big questions were answered. Sad."
1,Totally limp...,"If reading the Odyssey series was compared to having sex, wemight say that the foreplay was great but the climax was ruined by asudden case of impotence. A total let down."
2,Why?,"2001, A Space Odyssey concluded with""For though he was master of the world, he was not quite sure what to do next. But he would think of something.""That's where it should have been left."
2,Clarke too old to write new words,"Have read all the books in this series, and literally got to read them again in this one. Clarke is one of the few authors in the world unafraid to plaigiarize himself. Several of the chapters of this extremely slim volume are word-for-word lifts from the other books.If your memory is bad or this is the first work of Clarke's that you've ever picked up, then you'll probably enjoy this little read, but I'd wait until it comes out in paperback if I were you"
1,Bad,"This book is almost as bad as 3001. The first 25 pages are interesting. The rest is a waste of time, especially the non-climatic climax. Clarke has written a self-serving money maker to trap into adding to the value of his estate. Give it up Arthur. You're outdated.If you want good Clarke, read ""Tales from the White Hart"" or ""Childhood's End."
2,A huge disappointment,What happened to Heywood Floyd and to HAL? I thought that they would reappear in this book but no..NO! Thay simply seemed to have disappeared. It was as if Mr. Clarke forgot to read his other books before writing 3001. The story actually does not follow the path of 2001 series and it appears as if he wrote the book just because a publisher asked him to. The life seems to be missing from the book. It definitely was a big disappointmnet to read the book and realise that the ideas postulated -- the hub around earth -- is borrowed form his previous novels. What happened to originbality. He has been the pioneer of his times and in fact the 2061 ends with the line -- Ans the monolith awaoke. At this time the monolith is supposed to be in the courtyard of the UN building ON EARTH not somewhere floating above. Simply very disappointed. Reda it if you are a ACC fan . But if you want to keep the feeling of Odeyssey series....forget it..Don't even touch this book.
1,What was the point? *SPOILERS MAYBE*,"Clark's ""3001"" has no plot, no sense of urgency. Too much of the reader to accept the coincidence that Frank Poole is awakened at the same time the monolith aliens decide to exterminate humankind, and at the same time that the Bowman/HAL aka ""Halman lifeform comes into contact with Poole.When Poole finds out the monolith aliens are about to destroy mankind, there is no build-up to this occurrence, or suspense as he takes part in averting this disaster. It's telling, not showing.Majority of the book, as many readers have brought out, is just about Frank Poole being brought up-to-date in the 31st century. The dealings with the aliens are put in for a small portion towards the end of the novel."
3,Tied up with a ribbon,"Although there remain a few unanswered questions, 3001 tries to tidy up the whole Monolith storyline. Clarke offers quite a few insights into the next millenium, a rather presumptious effort. Although I found some of the concepts proposed by Clarke insightful, I think that he faired about as well as an intellectual in the 11th century would have done predicting our world....horribly! If mankind survives another thousand years, there will be advances which we cannot even begin to guess. I like Clarke's writing style, I found this book to be very readable. It was also a fast read. The concept is good, verified by four books on the subject, but something is missing. Maybe there needs to be one more. Maybe some questions can never be answered."
3,3rd Of 4,"After 2061 I almost passed on reading this one except I already owned a copy so I figured it couldn't get any worse than the last one. Fortunately I was right, barely. The initial premise is cool that Frank Poole could be revived after all these years but then the story delves into predictions of the future that are nowhere near as plausible as the predictions in 2001. To have come this far and make this the last book is the series it would have been nice to have answered some of the questions raised by the first two books. While 2061 looked like there was little else there besides the reputation of the first two books at least this book starts with an interesting premise."
2,Read something more worthwhile.....,"This book is, thank God, better than the atrocity that was 2061. There are some interesting ideas about the future - especially religion. The story is mildy entertaining, though quite uneventful. However, three quarters through this book, Clarke decides he needs to go ahead and end the series. He slaps together an extremely anticlimatic, sloppy ending, leaving you completely dumbfounded that more thought and effort wasn't put into concluding this series. Clarke's inconsistencies throughout these books were annoying as well. It seems as if each book changes or contradicts something that happened in a previous story. Bottom line - 2001 was great. 2010 was a cool addition, although not necessary. 2061 and 3001 are simply superfulous to the storyline and add little to the original masterpiece. Life is too short for such mediocre, unentertaining books."
2,A disappointing end to a terrific series,"The Final Odyssey is a big disappointment. There are no original ideas, but the author treats the ideas like they are his creations. The characters are not developed at all, and are merely plot devices with names. Arthur Clarke promotes his underdeveloped religious and philosophical ideas in a way that has nothing to do with the plot. The ending is the most unrealistic and disappointing part; it leaves the reader wanting more and wondering how the author weaseled his way out of writing an ending. Read the earlier ones, but to NOT ruin your appreciation of the series by reading 3001."
1,This book is the worst piece of writing i have read,whatever u do! don't buy this book! It is a total waste of money and you will not enjoy it. Save the money and go eat lunch at McDonalds. At least it will taste good.
4,CC episode 3,"My video was mailed rather quickly and it was in great condition! I was very pleased with the cover and even more pleased with the quality of the actual tape. I did think it was a little over priced for a VHS. Overall, I am a happy customer:)"
3,"Great Songs, but Overly Simple Arrangements","I love Tom Waits, so it's great to have a book containing so many of my favorite songs. This book works well as a fakebook to improvise from, but the piano arrangements on their own are far too simplified. The left hand is nothing but a basic, one-note bassline, while the right hand is just the melody. Not exactly what I was hoping for, but with a little bit of creativity on the part of the musician it can still be useful."
3,sounds like work,"In the two years since Blues Preacher, it sounds like somebody handed James and Aubrey a copy of John McLaughlin's Inner Mounting Flame. They could do a lot worse than emulate the work of Billy Cobham and Mahavishnu, and there are parts of this that I rather enjoyed. Aubrey Dayle is a much better jazz drummer than he ever was pounding rock.James, however, still needs to work on his jazz guitar skills OR simply get down to some serious blues stuff, which I suspect he's very capable of. Sometimes his licks are with it, but repeatedly, his improvisations go out of context and end up twisting in the wind like he's four.I also think he should lose that wiggly little billy-goat-Yoko-style falsetto thing he does when singing a long note."
3,It's an eh...,"I'm not a fan of this CD. It's pretty cool, but not cool enough to be it's own CD. Maybe a bonus disc. The first few songs are really good, and so are the last songs. The middle just has nothing special. S.L.A.B. should have never released this album by itself."
1,Always falls apart,"My daughter got this today from the ""Easter Bunny"". Right from the start when assembling it the pieces will not stay together. Under no circumstances does this product stay assembled. Although we love Strawberry Shortcake, this product is not worth buying. I should have bought the Fisher Price Friendship Pony stable."
2,Don't look at it or it will fall apart.,How dissapointing!!! This toy is so cute but if you look at it wrong it falls apart. THe design is also very weird and it is not easy to play with. My SSC but pass on this one unless on sale for really really cheap.
1,Cute concept - horrible implementation!,"This is such a great idea for a Strawberry Shortcake toy! Too bad it's really poorly constructed. My 4-year-old calls me up to put it back together at least three times before she finally gives up playing with it.The fences constantly pull apart, the walls separate from the front of the stable, and there is nowhere to keep all of the accessories (which are really cute, I must say) together when the stable is folded up. You could put them in the manger, but they just fall out as soon as you pick the silly thing up.Anyway, I was REALLY disappointed with this one. Santa thought he was bringing a great toy, but it was really bad. I would highly recommend the Strawberry Shortcake house instead - it's actually well-built."
2,Buy a tube of glue,Like everyone else my daughter keeps coming to me to put this back together. It is almost worthless as a stable. We too are going to glue it all together at least until it get chucked in the garbage (predicted to be soon). The horses on the other hand are great for preschoolers because they are pretty sturdy.
3,Kids still love it!,"This is an adorable toy. It also seemed like a great deal since it came with one horse and lots of accessories. however, the accessories don't make much sense to play with, more like set dressing and the stable itself keeps falling apart. I was very unhappy with it but my children LOVE IT. They play with it all the time. The are little so I have to keep putting it back together but they are not in the least bit phased. They especially like to keep it closed up (which is thankfully when it is sturdiest) and put the horses in it. I think it is an okay toy for the price, more annoying for parents than little ones."
3,"Fun, cute, but not very sturdy.","My daughter enjoys this toy a lot, and since I got it for a really good deal, it feels like it was worth the money. It is kind of flimsy, but it comes with lots of fun assesories, so theres plenty of things to do.I wish it was sturdier, but overall it's fun and cute."
2,Strawberry Shortcake Stable Playset,"My child has a blast playing with the horse and accessories. However, the stable does not stay together for long. I am constantly clicking the pieces back together."
1,Horrible! It will NOT stay together!,"My daughter received this toy last Christmas. It fell apart from the first time we tried to put it together. It stays in the floor in a heap of parts. My daughter will not let me throw it away because she wants so much to play with it. Unfortunately, as another reviewer stated, if you look at it - it will fall apart.What was this company thinking?!?!"
1,Not worth $6.00......Not worth a dime. Literally!,"I purchased this last fall for around $35.00...it sat in a pile in my daughters closet until she finally asked if she could throw it away last month....she's 6 years old. She loves ponies and SSC, but this is just junk. I can't even rate this toy a 1 star but thats as low as they would let me go because it is just that bad! I am writing this for those of you who may be tempted to buy it for the ""overpriced"" cost of $5.95. Please...you'll regret it.Yeah.....it's that poorly designed!I wouldn't have bothered writing this until I saw that it was on clearance."
3,Fun but fragile,"This toy seems to hold my 4 yr old's intertest well, but it is not very durable at all. It kept falling apart so I actually bought some model glue and glued all the parts together. Now you can't open it up, but I no longer have a teary eyed little girl coming to me with the pieces in her hands."
2,"Nice concept, horrible design",You will be very disappointed if you purchase this. It does not stay together for even 5 minutes. There are also so many useless small pieces. My daughter received this for her third birthday. If I had purchased this with my own money I would have been upset and probably would have returned it.
2,would not recommend,"It is constantly falling apart, and my daughter keeps asking me to put it together. Do not recommend, even though it is cute."
1,waste of money,"I bought this toy for my 4 year old daughter and had to throw it away within hours. It kept falling apart, as soon as you got it together and tried to play with it, it fell apart again. My daughter was very dissapointed. Also there are tons of tiny pieces that are impossible to keep track of, and they don't fit anyway."
4,Adorable Stable,My five year old daughter and her friends love this stable. It comes with one strawberry shortcake pony. My daughter puts all her ponies in it at night for them to sleep. I do daycare and it is used every day. An adult must assemble the small pieces. Not recommended for homes with babies.
2,Disappointing Playset,"It comes with a nice pony that Strawberry and her friends can sit astride, but the other props are paper or cheap plastic. The stable isn't even a nice ""set"" to place in front of because it is rickety and does not find together. We finally got out our old Little People Farm (90's) and let Honey Pie and the gang hang out in a sturdy plastic barn. It might not be to scale, but the gate works!!"
2,Who built this thing!?!?!?!,"LOVE the pony. It's a wonderful pony for your Strawberry shortcake dolls. UNFORTUNATELY this stable is the pits! I never got it ""put together"", because it doesn't STAY put together. Too many of the pieces move. The floor of the stable is in two parts, the walls are two parts. There is some kind of yellow trim piece that supposedly holds the walls together when closed, but it never fits right. There is a fence at one end that won't stay on. This needs to be re-assembled each time you pick it up. JUST BUY THE PONIES SEPARATELY, and you'll be a lot better off. They are really the quality item in this deal."
2,Not Worth the money,My daughter likes it so I am not returning it but this is really cheaply made and I am about to take my tube of super glue to it to see if it can be salvaged. It falls apart constantly and although I can understand that it only comes with one horse but they could have made it a bit bigger because we all know that there are at least four horses in the series (and more coming I hear).
5,Educational because.................,"This is a great toy and i think it is educational because it teaches children to style hair at an early age, in a smaller form! It's a great toy for everyone who loves color and also horses so yep i love it!! I am 12 years old!Thanx for reading!"
1,Don't buy this!,"My daughter really wanted this toy and asked Santa for it forever, at least six month, imagine our surprise on Christmas day when pieces were missing and we couldn't even put it together!!! Not worth the money paid!"
3,MY DAUGHTER LOVES THIS TOY BUT FALLS APART...,"IT IS CUTE, COMES WITH A LOT OF LITTLE ACCESORIES THAT KIDS LOVE, COMES WITH AN EXCELLENT PONY(HONEY PIE), THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT THE STABLE DOESNT STAY TOGETHER, THE FLOOR COMES OUT AND THE HINGES ON THE DOOR BREAK, THE LITTLE PRETTY PLASTIC FENCE KEEPS IT TOGETHER, IS BETTER TO SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THE PONIES"
1,Having a Garage Sale,"Stop ! This may look cute, but any amount of playing (even breathing on it) will cause it to fall apart. This toy did not last a month in our house. It never stayed together, and on top of that it comes with about 20 teeny tine ""grooming pieces"" (not kidding, most a smaller than a dime) Definitely a major disappointment for my daughters who love strawberry shortcake and horses."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Well, wish I would have read the reviews before I bought this one! The pony is cute-but I ended up throwing this stable in the trash..it is a piece of junk. Everytime my daughters tried to move it, open it ect. it would fall apart. I really wasted my money on this one..too bad because my girls love strwaberry shortcake."
1,there's no music?,"For 7.99 you get a dvd that works like a giant egg timer. with belches. Power hour should be played with background music, this dvd takes the fun completely out of drinking with friends. you're stuck staring at a TV screen reading insipid suggestions from 'beer man' instead of enjoying a drinking game..."
2,What shall I spend my money on today?,"Should I give my money to a homeless person, or get a DVD about how to drink beer?Is this seriously for sale? If you need to pay for a DVD with instructions on how to drink beer shots, you've got issues my friend."
1,Terrible,"Steve Rooster is clearly a huge dork. This game is terrible and the owner is sleezy for trying use a widely known term exclusively for this junk. This game isn't just not fun, it is also tedious and embarrassing."
1,Steve Roose is an overwhelming Jackass,"Steve Roose is an absolute jackass that, as others have mentioned, found a way to suck all the fun out of power hours. This poor excuse for a drinking game has somehow been trademarked. Trademarking the term ""Power Hour"" is like trademarking the term ""Merry Christmas."" The term Power Hour has been around for decades, and this assclown has found some loophole to trademark it and get all other LEGITIMATE power hours wiped from the internet. Don't support this jerk!"
2,"Great idea, but implemented very poorly.","I thought it would be an awesome surprise for my friend's birthday, but it turned out to be a disappointment. This video tries to turn 'power hour' to 'boring geek hour'. Oh well."
1,What a waste of money,Wish I wouldn't have purchased this. I can use my alarm clock next to my bed and be entertained better. At least that way I can have the tv on while we drink. 0 Stars.
1,Garbage in a box,"It says a lot when the only positive reviews for a product were made by the owners of the company that produces that product. This product is garbage. This product is as much of a game as an epileptic third grader that happens to have a seizure every sixty seconds: Sure, you can drink to both, but neither are really any fun. (Although, there is always the slight possibility that the third grader will wake up and spill profanities out of his mouth, which would be funny. Sadly, this ""game"" doesn't really have any hope for ever being humorous.There's infinitely better products out there. (Try [...] for example.) But listen, if you're seriously considering buying this product, please understand that this product doesn't do anything that any clock in your house does sixty times an hour. If you have a clock, you do not need this product."
1,Things I would rather spend an hour doing than play this game again:,"I would rather spend an hour ...... showering with a drunken clown than play this game again.... manning a glory hole in a truck stop restroom in Southeastern Arkansas than play this game again.... locked in a dark closet with a midget on PCP than play this game again.... in a hot tub with a horny priest than play this game again.In summary, this product is a waste of money. It's basically a bad powerpoint with a timer. You won't just be disappointed, you'll be furious.Sidenote: I was so disgusted with this game that I came back to Amazon to see what kind of person would give it a positive review. Not surprisingly, the only positive reviews have been from the seller and those who are obviously under his influence."
1,I need alcohol to forget this game,"There wasn't a spec of creativity that went into the production of this video/game. Basically, as I see it, this co-opter climbed on the shoulders of a great tradition, put his stamp on it - a heinously odious one - and is now selling it. It undermines the very virtue of why Power Hours became popular in the first place. I agree with the previous review - just Google Power Hour and find more sites than you know what to do with that are FREE and immeasurably better."
1,Manages to make drinking with your friends seem like a chore,"Really, really, really, really, really, really, really bad. Sucks the fun out of drinking entirely, as you're forced to watch a timer on a screen while you and your friends wonder in awkward silence what else you could be doing with your lives. Two DUI's, a failed marriage and chronic health problems - and I've never considered giving up the drink until now. What a piece of garbage. Ugh."
1,Useless product - far better ones out there,"Judging just from the Preview that this creator has proffered, it is an absolute waste of dollars and he or she should apologize for putting their hands in the pockets of individuals too unwise to shy away from this product. I would rather watch a stopwatch or egg-timer on a table to indicate each minute interval as opposed to watching this DVD give me absurd ""Tips"" or ""Game Suggestions"" from the ""Beer Master"". Do yourself a favor and do not support this unworthy product - and instead google ""PowerHours"" - you'll find much better music mixes or other ways to count down the 60 minutes."
1,Rip Off,"Having watched this video there are far more comprehensive games out there. Googling will get you free versions...or better yet, just borrow a stop watch or even a watch the clock in your frat house's microwave, when a minute passes take a drink.Spend your money on more beer; from the awful graphics to low video production quality this product is just flat out embarrassing."
1,Worst Power Hour Ever,"I can not fully describe how terrible this power hour is, as my brain is still trying to process how bad it was. Even if I were to forget about the terrible quality, the lack of music, the bad sound quality, etc. It would still be terrible. It is a timer with burp sounds. The man who made this must be mentally challenged, or at least seriously drunk when he made this product, for it may be the worst product ever made. This product single handedly turned me into binge drinking, as after using this terrible product I went into my room and drank a bottle of whiskey, since it killed my faith in in humanity. It brought me a stones throw away from mixing pills and liquer, it was so bad."
1,My God this is Horrible,What a waste of money. The drivel that emits from this DVD will kill your buzz before you even have one. It's like a drinking game inspired by the opening credits of Meet Joe Black. We ended up turning it off and going over our mid term review on my birthday. Wack.
1,Too bad I can't give it ZERO stars,"Worthless excuse for a power hour DVD. Don't waste your time or money on this boring garbage because the guy who made this is a talentless hack. There are much better power hour options (for free) online. DON'T PAY FOR THIS TRASH! I am only giving it one star because I have to. If Amazon had the option, I wouldn't give it ANY stars."
1,This is NOT Power Hour,"Glancing through the reviews, and also having played power hour way back in college (late 90s). I can safely say this is not how power hour is played. This product is as one reviewer stated, essentially a power point presentation with a burp sound. The two 5 star reviews are from Steve Roose (creator) and another gentleman who I suspect is a friend of Mr. Roose. Power hour is about having 60 songs that play for one minute each and taking a shot of beer; not a silent power point presentation. If I were to use this to pregame as the other reviewer suggested, I'm sure my friends would laugh at me for trying to get them to drink to some slides. If Amazon would allow zero or negative stars, this would be one of those products that warrants it. Save your money, and make your own power hour mix."
1,This should be removed from Amazon,"I didn't purchase this item, but was at a friend's house who did, and thought this product was so terrible that I had to warn others against buying it. There is simply nothing here of value. In fact, you can find the same exact thing for free everywhere on the internet."
1,"Wow, terrible.","Got this as a gift with a bunch of other crap from the same company. This is the kind of product that makes you want to drink because you're having such a BAD time alcohol is the only cure. Seriously, this thing is so boring it will suck the life out of any party. People fixate on the stupid screen and don't talk to one another, they just wait for the slide to change. STUPID."
1,A pathetic attempt by a textbook patent troll,"A shoddy product made by a sad, sad little man who is just trying to screw everyone else out of the ability to use the words ""Power Hour"". An overall pathetic attempt by an even more pathetic man. He should be ashamed of the crap he put Ms. Spagnola through."
1,Horrible idea,"I've never watched the DVD but the man who made it is sueing people the name Power Hour, saying he has the rights to the game that was thought of years ago. Just the fact that he is a scumbag I will not be purchasing this crap."
1,Trash,"This guy, and this DVD, is an absolute piece of trash. Steve Roose only made this DVD so he could run around and sue/shutdown people who want to use the term ""Power Hour,"" because lord knows this jackass invented the term. Suuuuure, I had never heard of power hour before this burping powerpoint DVD came out, of course, because it was never a common drinking game played in colleges EVERYWHERE."
1,"This is, quite honestly, the biggest piece of s*** on the internet","Steve Roose is a hack and a nobody. He is a liar, cheater, and plagiarizer, and a pathetic little man to say the least. This item is a blatant ripoff of a common game which he claims he came up with. You could have more fun with a stick and a rock."
5,Dares are the best.,This is power hour in a whole new light. I always played the iphone app with my music but i have to say this was an intelligent creations. All of the dares are funny and will make you laugh.
1,Worst Hour Ever,"Longest hour of my life. Would rather have my balls crushed in a vice and fed to to ball hungry bears then to have to watch this again. Dear God, please make it stop"
1,Horrible Product,"I can't believe such a horrible product is sold here on Amazon. They should take it off. It's so unimaginative and dull. People have been coming up with these types of songs and games for over 40 years. To think this guy has the gall to say he owns the idea of ""power hour"" with his horrible product, laughable. Expect a charge back on this one Amazon."
1,Worst ever,"There is no ""power"" here. Don't waste your time with this lame take on the traditional 'power hour drinking game'."
1,Abysmal,"With stunning (because of a lack of quality) motionless graphics and surround-sound burps every 60 seconds, this game (game? video? Lame compliation of Powerpoint slides?) is sure to lull you to sleep before you get 5 minutes into it! Though you'll be sure to get to do exciting things like try and tickle your friends before any of you have had more than 2 ounces of beer! I suppose that could be awkward enough to make you want to drink more, but in that case, a shot a minute just wouldn't be fast enough.You're better off spending this money to buy a clock, which you can also use for non-drinking purposes. Also, it can tell you the time, as opposed to ""42 minutes of pain left."""
3,"Great idea, follow through can be lacking","Avid Mac user, never owned anything else, so purchasing this was a no brainer. Ha! from the first day this ipod (purchased at a Mac store) never worked to my satisfaction. Played 10 to 20 songs then skipped, stopped and aggravated me. With three calls to service and plentiful wasted phone time waiting, the loss of all the tunes I placed into it and the anger management that I used it became evident that this was a mistake.The outcome is still to come. My ipod is in for service and was told that I will get a refurbished model to replace my [money] purchase. My confidence has been severely broken. I suggest that you look into this product very carefully before purchasing."
2,Not for running or jogging!,"If what you want is a portable device to run or jog with, simply forget it. It freezes after three or four songs (every time) and it is just the way it was built. I sent it for repair (they charged $29.99 for shipping), just to have it back with the same problem and the explanation that iPod's skip protection just lasts 20 minutes, even while Apple's website specifically states you can run with it."
1,Beware...,"Think iPods are god's gift? Apparently you haven't heard about their problems with battery life and freezing up.My iPod freezes up about every 15 - 20 minutes and has to be manually reset all the time. You can almost set your watch by it. I've tried to have it fixed but Apple says that nothing is wrong with it...Think my problem is rare? Go to Apple's website under the discussion board to find out just how ""rare"" it is. Believe me, EVERYONE is having this problem.These things also have chronic battery life problems. Expect it. This thing should be called the iPOS (think about it)"
1,"Nope, no comment","Went to Best Buy, decided to look around, saw shadowbane strategy guide, thought it might be nicely done, flipped to a random page, shut it, walked away. End of story"
2,"Updated, but still so far out of date","I bought the First Edition of this book not too long after I started playing Shadowbane, and back then it was a handy reference, even thought it had a lot of mistakes and omissions. I was pleased to see that they'd finally released an updated edition, but it is not even close to current. It doesn't have any mention of the Rise of Chaos expansion pack that has been out for quite some time, and is about to go even further out of date with the upcoming release of the ""Throne of Oblivion"" expansion pack.To be honest, you'll find just as much information with at least the same level of timeliness and accuracy for free online. And if you are playing the game, and not sure how to develop a good character, don't be afraid to ask for advice from higher level players in your race/class/discipline."
3,"Useful, but....","There is usable information in this book, but be advised it is a mess of typos and inaccuaracies. The Warlockry skill required to gain the Danger Sense power is 23 (not 45 as listed in the guide). And that is just one example. Page after page there are typos, column shifts, and omissions. My guess is they didn't have an editor. Still worthwhile if you can sift through it, but I wish someone had cared enough to do a better job."
1,Error after error,"At first glance, the guide looks terrific. Then you start noticing all the incorrect information on the spell lists and disciplines.*Class and race combinations are mostly wrong.*Disciplines: who can use are mostly wrong.The author's put ""filler"" information in the spell list were they did not have information for it. It looks like the editor didn't proof read that section at all. Luckily, all the spells are there. The rest of the book is just fine.But my reason for a 1 star is that:You make a mistake in what building you bought and it cost you a few hours and gold. Make a character, spend months leveling him and then find out that he can't use that discipline the book said you could and you're going to be REALLY upset. You'll have no choice but to start over.Class/race/discipline combos and the spell information changed very little if at all from beta. There is no excuse for poor quality control in those MOST important sections."
1,Incomplete and Incorrect.,"Within 24 hours of purchasing this guide I had found no fewer than 3 major errors. In particular when listing what races and classes could obtain certain disciplines.It severely lacks in details about the interactions between attributes and skills. (Such as how much Dexterity can affect your parry skill, and if dual wielding allows for dual parry.)I have found all the information in this book on the web through searches, and was hoping for a solid reference to the games mechanics and operations as to help me build better and more viable characters. I got neither of these from this book."
5,Excellent Journal...,"For all Lemony Snicket book lovers, this is a perfect journal to add to anyone's collection. With quotations of the books on all the pages, ""gruesome"" designs (Lemony Snicket's words, not mine), and stickers, it is a nice thing to have and write in."
5,Tis The Season,"Thankyou for this video. Know my friends and family and I each enjoy music, cartoons, and movies. Perfect combination for anyone."
5,Happy Holidays,I purchased this as a present for a young fellow and he was very happy. It plays great and he has wanted it for some time.
2,"It's called ""A Guide for Suckers""","You probably are a sucker to buy this book. I enjoy Harry Anderson and the book is amusing, but pretty thin on actual games you can't lose. In fact, it gives more coverage to games you cannot win. I was hoping for a book on what Harry Anderson calls ""Cunning Stunts"" but there are only a few in the book and a couple of those require cheating. On the other hand, if you think you can win at a casino or at 3 card monte, this book is a fun and simple way to show you just how wrong you are and will easily save you twice what you pay for it."
3,Not what you might expect,"Well, I bought this album after listening to tracks like ""Shine"" and ""Heaven will come"" (The club mix). I had some kind of expectation from this album, and I'm sorry to say I was disappointed. Except ""Forgiven"" and ""Shine"" which are the club tunes in this album, the rest of the tracks are very slow and kind of Enigma style, but not as good. Even ""Heaven will come"" appears in a low beat version here.So why 3 stars? The answer is the second CD, which contains remixes for the album hits, and was mixed by Paul Oakenfold. This CD can make you move, and I've found myself listening to this CD most of the time (and to ""Shine"" on the 1st CD).If you are just looking for the hits, go for the Maxi CDs. Otherwise, you may find this album a little disappointing."
3,Cute...,"I read the book in the time span of a couple days, which should say the most about this book. Generally Dee Henderson's books are so gripping I can't put them down, but not so with this one. The story was cute as most love stories are, but it really lacked the WOW factor that the O'Malley series had. It's a good read on a Saturday afternoon if you don't have much to do, but it's not one that you'll forever remember like you do with her other books."
2,Early work,"You can tell this was one of her earlier works. Simplistic, superficial, predictable. She has gotten much better over time."
3,Not her best work.,"I love Dee Henderson's books. I was, however, disappointed in this one. It lacked the story depth I've come to expect with Henderson books. There was so much more that could have been developed. I got bored with whole story as it centered around one person's physical pain and another's job anxiety. The first chapter and the last few are the only ones that really kept my attention. I have never checked to see how many chapters were left with a Dee Henderson book except to hope there was a lot. Not so with this book."
5,I loved this book!,It was wonderful story with turns I did not expect.I read it in just a few days!Kay of Oregon
3,Book,"Okay, not exactly what I was looking for. I can't believe they require a minimum amount of words. crazy, crazy"
2,Not very good...,"In the interest of full disclosure, Mr. Ronco wrote me and asked if I would be willing to read and review this book. No promises were asked or made as to what I would say about it. My basic problem with the story is that the characters are not fleshed out very well. We find them already formed, already bent on trying to introduce PeaceMaker to the computers of the world or prevent it from happening, depending on the character. The character of Dianne is far too manic in her mood swings to be believeable, just for starters. Her motivation is said to be the humiliation she received when held in contempt by the court at the anti-trust trial involving her computer company. If so, her reaction is extreme and otherwise unexplained. The book reads more like the outline of a larger book in which there is an interesting story to tell if done right. It just does not get done very well."
2,Hollywood script version of the book I wanted to read,"The software technology was unnecessarily anthropomorphic and silly, as is typical in a Hollywood treatment. That mishandling in turn discredited the supposedly genius software programmer and protagonist of the story. The characters are thinly developed in stereotypical fashion and the writing was only serviceable. Rather than write a great book and let Hollywood make the cheapened low-brow movie version, the author just wrote the cheapened low-brow version directly (probably hoping to facilitate a movie deal). I was disappointed."
4,Dead Man's Treasure is a treasury of humor,"An expiring British agent mails an invitation to Steed to a treasure hunt. The middle aged party giver of the car race admires Emma. ""What a beauty,"" says steed of his race car. ""Oh I agree,"" he says fervently, eyeing Emma. This one has a novel plot twist. Two killer secret agents infiltrate the car rally and stalk Emma and Steed. The two baddies are nonplused and outraged to discovering someone ELSE is cheating them! As always the brilliant Emma solves the mystery and wins... This was one of the best scripts toward the end of 1967."
4,Very Salinger-esque!,"I was a taken aback when I first read the Crowded Room... it was more than a little painful because the experience is very much like being in high school. The same games, the same confusion/apathy, kids looking to hook up or get wasted but mostly to be accepted. 1978 was a year after I graduated from high school and the protagonist generates both exasperation and identification. Michael Maupin is a risk taker and this is one wild Catcher in the Rye-style ride."
1,Made Me Sick,"I used smoke away and after the first 2 or 3 days it started making me sick at my stomach, did the same thing to my wife. After I quit using it we started feeling better the next day, Stick with the patch prescribed from your doctor."
5,stop smoking,"smokeaway is a very good product I have used it befor & quite tho I had to use two qts of the product unfortunately I did return to smoking so i'm going thru the process again, I tried patches gum lozenges none of them worked,"
5,Great product,"This product worked for me where others failed. The SmokeAway kit I ordered lacked the compact disk and cost a lot more. I should have checked Amazon first, but since it REALLY WORKED I'm very happy even though I spent twice the money for less product. I took phase one for just five days, then gave the rest of the kit away to a friend. Now, four and a half months later I'm still nicotine free and the ""nic fits"" are less frequent and way less intense. Sometimes I go for days without even thinking about a smoke.Is there willpower involved? You bet. This product gets you thru the first week or so, after that its up to you. You must WANT to quit. This product does what its advertised to do, however. It helps you get off nicotine in that all important first week or so. After that, you have a fighting chance to gut it out the rest of the way.Great product."
3,Indifferent reviews Please?,"Could we PLEASE get a review from a NON CHRISTIAN prospective? Personally I see there are certain truths to the bible including ""the truth shall make you free"" in which, the bible tells on itself, because a christian (truely believing in the entire bible) is certainly not free."
3,Great Book,I bought this for a reference source. It is very ell written and a good source of reference for me.
4,Very Important!,"The author presents a lucid and entertaining accout of the reality of masonry. For those unfamiliar with this insidious secret society, this is tremendously important information. One could make a good case for masonic involvement in the terror of the French Revolution, the Great Depression, World Wars I & II, and the September 11th terrorist attack, among many other sinister events. Perusal of the other reviews of this excellent book is illustrative. Christians applaud the work as revealing significant truths. Secret society members say it is a pack of lies. Who do you believe? Perhaps the author strikes too close to home for the comfort of those who would plot against Christians in secrecy. The Lord said, ""The truth shall make you free."" There is much important truth in this book. May God bless the author and publisher."
1,"If you believe this, I have bridge in brooklyn to sell you...","I will say this and be done with it:Freemasons are not bent on controlling the world.Freemasonry is not a religion.Freemasons do not worship Satan/Lucifer/The DevilFreemasonry only requires that you believe in a supreme being. I.E- A God/Deity/What have you.Freemasonry generally doesn't give a rats behind if you are Wiccan/Catholic/Buddhist/Muslim/WHATEVER.Freemasonry is not evil.And if you really think differently, then you have never met a mason/gone to a masonic event and seen how long it takes for them to decide *what kind of sandwiches to eat at their next meeting*.SERIOUSLY. Think for yourself. Do your research."
5,DO NOT BE FOOLED BY GOOD DEEDS!!,"People often make the assumption that if an organization donates millions of dollars to charities or the underpriviledged, that it must be a good organization. In this case, the good deeds of Freemasonry and the Masonic Craft are not on trial. The question for the Christian is, ""Can one be a Christian and a member of Freemasonry?"" God says in His Word, ""Thou shall have NO other Gods before me."" The explanation that the ""Great Architect of the Universe"" is a generic term that one replaces with his own God does not exempt one from idolatry. The question is, ""Is Freemasonry, the Masonic Craft, The Masonic Order or The Prince Hall of Masons an organization that practices and encourages the practice of idolatry?"" This book makes a presentation of both sides, and the reader can draw his own conclusions without being distracted by good deeds or millions of charity dollars."
3,An interesting read...,"I have read the book--and well, am surprised at what I read (especially since it's true!) I found it to be useful--yeah, occasionally, it's kind of tedious, but in some spots, interesting.I would just briefly like to comment on Masonry in general. It's this: Masonry has already been established as a secret society and a religion. They actually do have secret stuff going on behind closed temple doors (and if you don't believe me, you can go to any encyclopedia and find this out for yourself.) They actually aren't picky on which deity you choose--in fact, they are quite lenient!Everything I've said so far is pretty much 100% fact; feel free to do the research if you don't believe me.--J"
5,masonry explained,"this is a great read. it is so good you wont be able to put it down. i also recommend ron rhodes book, masons reasoning from the scriptures. get both and really enjoy learning about masonry and how they twist the bible. enjoy."
1,Canon high-power flash,I was disappointed with this product and returned it to Amazon. The service from Amazon was excellent.
3,Great Fill-Flash,"I bought this to use with my new Canon SX100IS when the standard pop-up flash is just not quite enough. It has proven very useful when shooting large dim interiors (stage shots, church photos, etc.) and outside at night when the subjects are not close. The unit is well constructed and the mounting hardware is sturdy. However, I did have to modify the mounting bar slot slightly because it was not quite long enough to allow the flash to fit the Canon SX-100IS body. A small bit of filing at the end of the slot fixed this, but not everyone would want to undertake this type of modification."
2,Great While It Lasted...,"I was very pleased with this flash for the year or so i had it, but now the bulb seems to have died & Canon offers ZERO remedy for the problem. No repair, no replacement: ""So sad, too bad.""As a faithful Canon user for decades (my first Canon camera had a BRASS body!) this is extremely disappointing. Another wonderful symptom of our disposable society.I've yet to seek a remedy from Amazon, but am not optimistic..."
3,Canon SureShot XS-10 flash,"Love the flash, just not happy with the lenth of flash bar, seems to be a bit tight, next to camera.Quater inch longer. Flash is great, good distance at night."
4,Canon HF-DC1 Flash,"I bought this flash for a canon S95 camera. Works as advertised though one needs to check pictures for overexposure. Is small, easy to carry and extends the flash range of the camera. Works with other cameras too since it senses the pre-flash for firing. The mounting bracket is useful but holding it away from the camera provides better lighting control"
5,Canon wins again,"As is usual with any Canon product, this unit functions as intended and greatly extends the range of my A570 flash. I take a lot of indoor pictures of family gatherings and usually try to get a number of people in most shots. This requires photos from a distance and the flash on my camera was not quite up to the task. By using the HF-DC1 flash attachment, I now get crisp clear photos without shadows even up to 20 feet away.I would highly recommend this flash attachment to anyone who's flash isn't quite strong enough to get the pictures they want."
4,Works as advertised,"greatly improved the flash range (and, unfortunately, the bulk) of the SD400. a required add-on for that camera if shooting indoors."
4,Extra Power for Flash,"Provides the needed extra power for the flash when the camera is used to take photos at longer distances from the subject. Flash does not electronically attach to the camera, but is powered by the cameras flash. Would work with any other camera."
4,Canon HF-DC 1 High Power Flash,"I had been having issues with underexposure until I bought the Canon HF-DC1 High Power Flash. It was a good investment because it has added a touch of professionalism to my photography.Except for the high price, I would recommend it to anyone who has a Canon Powershot Digital camera.I did not rate it 5 stars because I beleive it is unnecessarily overpriced."
4,Canon Camera Flash,"This unit is really good for addition light when making digital images. The bracket is slightly short to correctly fit my Canon Powershot SX100, but if I angle it a bit, it still works. The shipment was prompt and accurate."

5,Review--Panama,"After retiring a few years ago and living in the Colorado rockies, I'm now ready for a warm climate, and my budget absolutely demands a low cost of living. After reading Choose Panama the Perfect Retirement Haven (second edition), I discovered a country I hadn't even considered. I had no idea Panama was such a find for retirees.This book is well organized and easy to read. It's full of facts, not just about the nice places to live, but all the other things a retiree needs to know like housing costs, climate, cost of living, medical insurance and medical care. Also, the author walks you through the immigration options offered by the government of Panama. I give it five stars.Ray LarsonCrestone, CO"
1,The book has little value,This book has 170 pages but if you take away the extra line spaces and pictures you could have saved at least 100 pages. The book contains very little useful information and I would be very surprised if the author actually resides in Panama. If you are looking for a very basic book with little information then this is the book for you. My suggestion is go to the web and save your money for something useful.
4,Panama as a retirement getaway,"We live in a climate which gets bitterly cold in the winter. As experienced expatriates having lived 20 years in other countries, we are fine with taking on a foreign language and adjusting to different customs. This book is informative about all aspects of expat life: property purchase rental or purchase, cost of living, shopping, language, suggestions about where to locate, etc. The author gives the wise advice to visit several times before making the decision to choose Panama as a part-time or full-time retirement location."
4,Panama,Very good book. Has many interesting facts about the city and surrounding areas. Booked a trip to Panama and used the book to locate where to stay and what to do while we are there.
3,Choose Panama The Perfect Retirement Haven,A quick read - A good book for a basic overview of retiring to Panama.
2,CHOOSE PANAMA-THE PERFECT RETIREMENT HAVEN,"Enjoyed the book but a little lite on real information. Most information is available on the web and it is free. I feel book over priced,however, some valuable information."
5,Choose Panama,"This informational ""matter-of-FACTS"" book on The Republic of Panama, as a potential retirement haven, is RIGHT-ON-TARGET ! I have visited Panama, and can state, categorically, that author Bill Hutchings is truly plugged-in to the important particulars regarding living in Panama. I spoke with several persons, whose names are mentioned in "" CHOOSE PANAMA "". I did not reveal that I found their names / contact data through Bill Hutchings' book. However, EVERY SINGLE THING that Bill relays to the reader is ""point-blank"" true & honest. This is a very valuable reader for anyone, who might be planning to explore The Republic of Panama as a place to live out one's life, in bliss. Period."
1,Night mare for white people,"In August of 2011 to end of Febuary 2012 my twenty year old mild mannered,pleasant sOn stayed in theBoquete area. Our plan was to teach part time and to travel. We were excited to get to know about their culture.We were in for the ruddest,meanest and most frightening time of our lives. People were cruel, dirty, lazy. MOSTOF THEM WERE GREEDY,LIARS AND EVEN VIOLENT.I DO NOT KNOW OF YOUR LIFE STYLE OVER THERE BUT I PROMISE THAT YOU ARE NOT WHITE PEOPLE LIVING WITH THE WORKINGCLASS PANAMANIANS."
4,Elvis is alive and well,"The stark contrast between the white background and photograph makes the picture realy stand out. It is a very bright shirt. The fabric is comfortable, but a bit stiff. Over all I think it is a great shirt which fits in to my hawian shrit collection. The shirt rates a very cool with me (the best rating I give is suprer cool)."
4,No loss,"I took a chance and purchased this 100' audio cable, for it's size I though I would get a little signal loss , the signal from the source and the signal at the end of the cable was about the same nothing to worry about."
2,And still we have more Japanese authors leaching on to varia,"This book could have been written by taking exerps from other books on TPS and rearranging the pages. Same old, same old more same old.We need an American's view on the practicle application of TPS not advice from some guy from Japan who doesn't have the faintest idea of American culture or people. So there!"
4,Intrupted Melody,"I am an opera lover. The first time when I saw this film, I wanted to see it again. At last, I was able to add it to my collection.It is the life story of Australian opera star Marjorie Lawrence (Eleanor Parker) who meets an American Doctor (Glenn Ford) in Paris while in school. They meet again in the States and get married. She is stricken with polio but she overcomes it and returns to perform one of the Wagner's best operas.Eleanor Parker is great and the story is magnificent. I recomend it specially to opera lovers."
5,simply the best,"thank god for the warner brothers manufactuer on demand archieve collection for putting this 1955 classic biopic on dvd. i'm not a fan of opera music but i enjoyed it in this true story of marjorie lawerence and her rise to fame and surviving havingpolio. if you are a classic movie fan like me,you can do no wrong with this movie!"
2,disappointed,HelloI am very disapointed because I live in France and this film had no subtitles !otherwise I received it twice and have payed twice probably because of a mistake and I dont kwow how to sent at least one back...Thanks for your helpSincerely
4,"Great Film, Especially for Opera Lovers","I think this is a beautiful film, well acted, written and beautifully sung by Eileen Farrell. The opera segments are wonderful and Eleanor Parker has the best role of her career. By all means see it, especially if you are an opera buff. The quality is actually quite good, although a full re-mastering should be done."
4,Biopic of polio-stricken Wagnerian soprano Marjorie Lawrence,"Eleanor Parker, a dramatic actress of the higher second rung in 50s Hollywood, takes on legendary Australian Wagnerian soprano Marjorie Lawrence who, at height of career (20s & 30s), was stricken with polio. Lavishly staged scenes from operas -- sung by the astonishing Eileen Farrell (American pop/Wagnerian songstress of 40s & 50s) -- make this quite the feast for dually addicted film/opera fans. Best of all is footage of Parker/Lawrence making a tough comeback by belting out the 'Siegfried' Brunnhilde and Isolde from reclining position. They really don't make them like this anymore. How many 14-year-old males with their bills pointed backwards would buy tickets?"
3,Buyer Beware!,"This title is part of the new Warner Archive Collection, a noble effort. Be warned, it is not a professionally pressed DVD but a burned DVD-R copy. It will not play on player/recorders or computers. It will only work on ""play only"" devices. That said, I'm happy that Warner is releasing this series of slightly less than marketable titles. I just wish that, for the price, they played on all equipment. It is indeed a 16:9 transfer and the color is lush and the sound is good."
5,Aspects is like space,"It's a little strange to find or place reviews of such a seminal and magisterial work on a commercial web site. Aspects (and Syntactic Structures) essentially created the intellectual space in which linguists have operated for almost half a century. Not reading Aspects is only possible in the way that not reading ""Origin of Species"" is. An interested reader can certainly learn the same stuff another way -- more easily, in fact -- but when you come to understand it, you will want to get to the source for yourself."
5,a very important work now in kindle,"One of the most important works of Chomsky's. It is preceded by experimental modelling of linguistic knowledge based on rewriting rules and the resulting conclusion of the need for transformations and is followed by new innovating ideas on restricting the power of transformations. We already see the deep thinking that went into the development of the next stage. He discusses the idea of 'singulary transformations' which the individual transformations were, then, composed of and which later developed into Move-alpha, Delete-alpha, etc. He argues very persuasively for a separate 'lexicon' and the kind of information we should expect to find there. Overall, it is rich with seeds that later developed into the ideas comprising the 'principles and parameters' theory. And most importantly, it gives the shrewd and disciplined argumentation, which became a standard of Chomsky's later works and generative grammar in general."
1,Not such a good read...and not out of spite.,As a Ph.D. student in linguistics I had to read a lot of classic books in the field. Chomsky always struck me as awfully dry. Read syntactic structures if you must. BTW why bother writing a review if you have not read the book....
5,Very happy,"The German post/DHL combination ensured that the CD arrived, if anything, more rapidly than many domestic (U.S.) items I ordered around the same time! The CD sounds perfect. Highly recommended."
4,Get Fuzzy lifts the heart,"I love the journal because when I look at the illustration on the cover it reminds me of how quirky, funny, and irrascible my own ""fur family"" of one dog and three cats are. The blank pages give me plenty of space to write the adventures they have had. It is ""purfect"" for the pet owner. I am grateful that the Get Fuzzy comics are there, for they lift my spirits."
5,Fast Delivery But........,I think the book could of come packaged better - it was just thrown in the box - some of the pages were crinkled as well as the outside of the book
4,Great Jazz Group!,"Too bad they haven't produced more albums! But, I really enjoy the way they groove and blend! Wish I could have more of their stuff, especially the Christmas album."
2,Ok book,Light reading. I wasn't impressed with how the story developed. It just seemed like the plot and characters never quite developed.
5,Works As Advertised,Easy to install. Works as advertised. Excellent color instructions included. I placed the instructions (which are printed in color on quality paper) on the inside of the panel box for future reference. Excellent benchmark speeds with each connection. I highly recommend this unit.
2,boring,"I dont think genetics playis as important role in who you are, because if that was true I wont be here. I am a sucessful executive and my parents and grant parents could not count to one thousand....and I am black for that matter, however I am really smart 130 IQ. good try Daniel you are not white eather Italian really."
4,muy bueno,"Es un libro muy bueno para entender como funciona el cerebro ante nuestrocomportamiento social, demostrando la importancia que tiene las relacionessanas con los demas para nuestro bienestar. Nos pone en el camino de buscar como mejorar el contacto social para nuestro desarrollo personal."
5,A great find!,"I've been a Jack London fan since reading ""The Call of the Wild"" in the 4th grade, and I was surprised and delighted to come across this collection of essays. It offers great insight into the London's development as a man and an author, and the trials that a writer faced in London's day.London's novels set me on my path to becoming a writer myself. If you're hardcore fan of London -- especially if you're also a writer -- this will be a great read and a natural addition to your book collection."
2,Too weird for my taste.,"I get a charge listening to pianists like Oscar Peterson, Junior Mance, Horace Silver (my favorite) Thelonius Monk, Nat ""King"" Cole and Ahmad Jamal. Jacki Byard in this recording just it too wacked-out in his playing. To me it sounds like an experiment that went wrong. Atonal and awkard it fails to grow on me after a month of listening to it. Each to his own music."
3,Its okay.,"I have been a fan of cardigans from the moment i heard ""lovefool"". I have all their cds and still remains on my playlists. This album is not so much a depature from the other albums' slower ballads. That is generally what you get here: slower mild tempo tracks. Every song is good but doesnt carry the energy from the previous albums. If you are new to the group, listen to ""other side of the moon"" has a nice transition from the earlier songs [life] to their newer more rock oriented [gran turismo]. That album gives you a general spectrum of their sound."
3,The Cardigans....,"I was a major fan of The Cardigans, but honestly, they weren't so great after Gran Turismo. I liked the majority of that album, but post that, I just wasn't a fan. I would love to Erase and Rewind all the way back to THAT musical era."
5,"New sound, took about four listens before I fell in love","I have all of the other Cardigans albums, but didn't pick up this one when it came out because I heard it was departure from their usual sound, and usually this doesn't bode well when bands do this.Anyway, finally got around to it, and the first few listens, I found it too slow and the songs too similar, but the more I listened to it, the more it grew on me, and each song started to stand out individually. It definitly is a departure. There is no ""bubble gum"" electronica on this album. This album has now become my favorite for nighttime listening, especially when highway driving.This really is an excellent album, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a good, solid, angst filled album, or is a fan of Nina's voice."
5,Extraordinary return,"The Cardigans were one of the greatest (and underappreciated) bands of the 1990s. The enormous success of the goofy ""Love fool"" clouded the fact that they were producing some of the most sophisticated pop in the world. Mixing the long tradition of Swedish pop with nuanced influences of the British scene, this group managed in their first records to mantain the charm of Roxette and other bands and updating it to the Europop of the 90s. This CD, however, establishes a whole new path of the band. Nina Persson's sweet, passionate vocals are still there, but they changed their happy undertones for a more sustained melancholy. The songwriting is remarkable, their lyrics is the best ever. The music still keeps a distinctive Cardigans sound, but it is way more mature, with the synthetizers almosr gone and a more consistent bass line. A must have for anyone, old fans and people who have never heard of them"
4,Not bad at all!,"I kept on reading how this album is their worst effort and how it's boring. Well, when I read that it was boring I knew I would probably enjoy it and guess what!? I DID! And being sort of a fan of their music in the past particularly such as their album Gran Turismo, I could say that this last one is their best yet and they have evolved with their sound. There's nothing wrong with that!Also I read how they sound so americanized *rolls eyes* and jewel-like and man if only Jewel can sound this good!The female singer sounds better than ever as a vocalist.Highlights in my opinion are communication, good horse, couldn't care less, and then you kissed me, live and learn, and if there is a chance.Do yourself a favor, if you are a cardigans fan LISTEN to it and do your best to accept their new sound AND if you like just great music CHECK THIS ONE OUT!"
5,Beautiful,"the first single is very emotional...the first time i hear i hate it but later i love it...is very sentimental and the last part is UMMMMMM...i love this last ""shout"".AT the album are more good song like ""feathers and down"",""live and learn""and ""no sleep"".this song are when you are bored or when you have to study theuy are very relaxing is like a unplugchillout discyou have to buy it"
3,Just OK,"To get a feel for where I'm coming from-Gran Turismo: one of my favorite CDs, I listen to it often even after several years. The Cardigans earlier stuff: fun, a bit too fluffy. I own First Band on The Moon but I don't listen to it often.Ok, now for this CD-Long Gone Before Daylight: it definitely has the same, slower mood as Gran Turismo, but it lacks any standout songs. It's too forgetable. Frankly, it's boring. I'll listen to it because I like Nina's voice, but I don't recommend this CD."
2,You people like boring music.,"I'm not saying i don't like slow music, but it has to be good. The only word to describe this album is: bland. It seems so completely uninspired for a band that is incredibly original. But there's still hope. The bands new album: SUPER EXTRA GRAVITY, which was just released in the UK, is a step in the right direction. They are back to writing densely layered pop compositions. THANK GOD. I thought we lost them."
4,one of their best!,This is by far the best CD album from The Cardigans!!!The lead vocalist's voice has matured and it sounds better than ever.This new countrish sound fits them very well.the bonus track is ok.the dvd as a plus is just awesome!
2,Antik,"This is a OK shoe. But not for the price... This shoe is not worth $130.00 it is worth about $35.00. Very high shoe, and for a wedge they are difficult to walk in. They are also narrow."
3,reprint of old dictionary,The potential buyer should be warned that this is a reprint of a dictionary originally published in 1882.
5,Excellent cd,"Great cd at a great price! Always have lovedReal Life's music, and this disc doesn't disappoint. If you can find the US version, it's even better, it has a 2nd disc of remixes. I nowhave both this Australian and the US versionsfor my collection. This had a limited copy release, I only wish it would have been one of the signed ones the group sent out."
2,NOT A GOOD BUY,"I do not like this jersey. I also bought the ""Swingman"" jersey made by Adidas. It's a higher end replica jersey from what I was told. If you are interested in an autographed jersey to keep (not sell), the authentic NBA jersey is not the way to go. The numbers on the ""Swingman"" jersey are much larger, and are better suited for autographs. The authentic NBA jersey is smaller and itchy, and just doesn't look as good as the replica."
2,"A dissapointment, the band has had its day","This album sounds like it was produced by a gothic punk band.. I have to say that while Manson himself might be great with concepts and lyrics, his musical abilities are non-existant. If you look in the CD cover, you will notice that Twiggy wrote nearly all the songs, and now that he is gone, the music is empty. If you are a fan of Mechanical Animals, you will feel the songs, they are full of emotion and depth - MA, Great big white world, speed of pain, fundamentally loathesome... those songs all have something which this album doesnt - sure the CD is not unbearable and one can still listen to the songs, but it really is a waste of time... if you want to buy your first Manson CD, get M.A."
1,Poseur,"Buy any album by Skinny Puppy if you're looking for a message delivered with power, sans the gimmicks."
1,Please go away.,"Marilyn Manson is like a joke that's not funny anymore. He's pretty much just fighting for attention now, and desperate to prove he's somehow as important as Trent Reznor or Alice Cooper. Too bad those guys actually have talent, and he's just some weirdo in a dress that won't go away. Face it dude, you're over. Go scare old ladies in the parking lot at Sears."
1,Golden Age... How do you figure??,"I don't know what these men were thinking when they produced this... this thing... I don't think I've ever listened to an album and wanted to vomit on myself. I've loved Marilyn Manson for ever... Portrait, Smells Like Children, Antichrist, Mechanical Animals... all amazing... Holy Wood wasn't so hott, but it was way above this thing... I don't know what happened here... Golden Age is just an absolute disaster... Marilyn Manson used to say these brilliant things that resented other things people said about him and now it seems he is just trying to fit this 'o, i'm evil, i'm evil' label people have thrown on him. Even lyrically, this album is nothing compared to what the others were. It seems he began to just randomly make up words; such a thing a common rapper would do... right thurr right thurr. Surely the low-point in their career and a very sad day for music. *tear*"
3,"It's different, but still good!","In my eyes, Manson will never make a bad album... so I can only compare this with his other better works. I like it, and I would bye it. But there's just a few things about it that don't step up to his previous albums. First off, Mobscene's cheerleading chants are a total rip off of Faith No More's ""Be Aggressive"". Also I just don't feel the passion like his previous albums... I guess it happens to the best. They start off pissed off at the world, then they get rich and famous, and aren't so pissed off anymore... still if your a Manson fan, you should know that you can enjoy any of his works, he'll never make a ""bad"" album."
4,A culmination of Manson,"Now that Manson's trilogy is over (Anti-Christ, Mechanical, Holywood), Manson moved on to more loose music. This album has elements from all of Mansons other works and still manages to push his sound in different directions.Tracks like Theater, Doll Dagga, mObscene, sAint and Ka-boom Ka-boom have the dirty kid feel of Portrait. Tracks like New *hit, Vodevil, and SlutGarden have the raw aggreshion of Anti-christ. And tracks like Golden age, Spade, and Para-Noir have the deep sad melodies invloving the pain of love and the decay of sociaty. Holywood itself was a mix of elements from Anti-christ and Mechanical Animals to begin with.This cd has everything a Manson fan caould love. Catchy songs, angry industrial songs, deep love ballads, and some very fun jazzy songs. I only take off one star because of some of the lyrics."
5,CYBERPUNK/INDUSTRIAL ROCK,"Marilyn Manson is the rockstar we all wish we could be. He does and says whatever he wants...whenever he wants. This album is loaded with fantastic and confrontational lyrics and hard hitting industrial beats all put nicely to a pseudo ""rap"" cyberpunk approach. A fun and outrageous endeavor....awesome album indeed MR. Manson."
2,Golden Age Of Disapointment,"I don't know what Manson was thinking! He fires Twiggy, Hires Tim Skold, and you get this? When you think of Manson you think of shocking lyrics, and music that makes you feel like youre in hell, but you like it. GOAG is not as harsh sounding as Manson claimed, saying: ""it's like being kicked in the balls with a brick tied to a shoe"". In my opinion it's like when my little sister throws a grape at me. Not saying it's a bad album, but as a Manson album it sucks."
3,"Buy the ""unlimited"" version instead","Trust me if you pay the extra four bucks for this cd with the bonus dvd, you might as well just burn your four bucks since the DVD is a mindless repetitive rant from Manson with repititive footage that looks like it came from a Home VHS recorder. Dont get me wrong I like the music on the cd just dont waste your money on this version buy the regular one instead."
5,marilyn makes a come back into the world of real rock,First off this cd is better then i could have hoped for. I was a really big fan of twiggy and still am but new bassist tim skold manages to pull it off adding new value to the band. Every track on the album has something new to offer if u really dive deep enough into it. It isnt his best work but nothing can really compare to 1996's antichrist superstar. SO if you are a fan of the man or arch daddy danda you should pick this up in a hurry. This album is even worth buying just for a few tracks even tracks 6 through 10 are just so incredibl you will fall in love with them as soon as you here them so pick this album up.
3,Pretty good,"I just listened to the whole cd,was expecting something really wonderful,as John Davis also said that Manson is just getting better and better.Mobscene sounds a lot like the fight song!"
4,Manson is back,"This is a return to the true Manson. Best album since Antichrist Superstar, which is easily the best Manson album. Grotesque has much of the same gritty edge which made Superstar great and does not have the overproduced, commercial feel of Mechanical Animals or the going-through-the-motions doldrums of Holywood. And unlike those latter two, this one has plenty of those turn-up-the-volume-and-rip-off-the-knob, slam-your-accelerator-all-the-way-to-the-floor-and-scream-like-a-madman moments. I have always believed true artists could never endure commercial success and thought that was the case the past couple of Manson albums, but this one proves me wrong."
4,"Not Mansons best, but still good music","I bought this album the day it came out. i listen to all kinds of music, but for manson, hes not for every one. he is really an eye opener, but i like him. so i own most of his albums, this is a good ablum, but i still think hes best was Holywood. You can listen to that whole album without skippimg any tracks. but this one dosent have as much energy as most of his others. But hes always changing his image, and does it very well. so i give him major credit. My favortive tracks are ""This is the new ...."" and ""The Golden Age Of Grotesque"". Hes a very dark man, and carrys that image very well, and continues it in this ablum.But if your a Manson Fan, then you should buy this ablum for sure."
3,Where is holywood again?!?!?!?,This is not the paramount of Marlyn Manson's slowly dieing career.The album is a good hard album with very little shock value.The over played chants from a bad nightmare at school really grew old.The dvd is a bad try at S&M art form of expression. I did and was expecting a better album from the one of the kings of shock. In contrast the guitar riffs and keeping a little of the sound that made Marlyn Manson popular was a great change from the rock and metal sound that polute the radio airwaves of todays radio set list. Not to much of this cd set was shocking or entertaining and I would suggest one be a hardcore Marlyn Manson fan before concidering purchasing this bad attempt at a shock pop culture album.
3,Ho-hum,"Well well the brand-spanking new album from Manson has all the promised tried and true factors of previous albums. Outlandish sleeve art, extreme make-up, controversial songs, a brand-new thematic image.... But what about the music itself? With the departure of Twiggy Ramirez last year the bulk of the songwriting has gone to replacement Tim Skold and guitarist John 5, but doesn't live up to the standard that Ramirez was able to create. Gone are the melodies of previous albums, replaced instead by the same generic hard rock tempo/riff with a chorus generally consisting of a snippet of Manson's wisdom screamed/declaimed, with no other musical qualities. The production is very slick though, creating a soundscape that stands up to most of the previous albums. However it can't make up for the boring music on this album"
2,Easily Mansons worst.,Well Manson had been putting out good music for a few years now so you just knew it was coming. Well I guess every artist is entitled to atleast one crap cd. Everything about this cd is below what mansons capable of. Do yourself a favor and go listen to Mechanical Animals or Holy Wood and pretend The Golden Age of Grotesque was all a dream.
2,Umm??,"I am a really big fan of Manson and although I favored one or two songs of this album I would have to agree with some of the people when I say this is not one of Mansons ordinary wave and all in all not too great of a C.D. But, hey to each it's own it's just my opinion after hearing this album it didn't as many others have said even really sound like Manson it sounded like a different person. I'm sure every artist gets curious in trying something different which looks like he is trying to do. Tried it, didn't work well now let's get back with the OLD MANSON! I would save my money and pass on this cd, you want some real Manson music get his older albums; Anti-Christ Superstar or Holly Wood (In The Shadow Of The Valley Of Death)."
5,Manson does it again!,"By far this is the best album that Marilyn Manson has released. The lyrics are crushing and the music is bone crunching. The best songs on the album are mOBSCENE, Para-noir and Ka-boom Ka-boom. Really all the songs are great. Manson has gone through many changes over the past 9 years and I believe that he has reached the pinnacle in his career. If he can ever top this album I would be greatly suprised."
4,Not a big fan of Manson but bought it for the heck of it!,"Personally I don't like MM because of his weirdness but I have been a big fan of his music so just for the heck of it, I picked up TGAOG at Best Buy today. My mom didn't want me getting this but I told her that I wouldn't become a hardcore fan. MM has done some things in his life that I, as a Christian, don't condone, but his band is really good. I don't recommend him to anyone because that would be just wrong. If you want to hear some industrial rock, then pick this up."
4,THIS IS ALBUM IS MANSONS BEST YET.,"I Tell You One tHing If You Are A True Manson Fan, This New Album Is Really Good. For Some Fans And Other They Don't Think Highly Of It But Thats Because They Just Don't ""HEAR"" Manson Anymore...They Lose Interest. I Think That By Far This Is Mansons Best Yet. Everyones Is Entitled To Their Opinion Though.It Has Some Down Fall On It With The Song "" Ka Boom"" But Mansons Just Trying Something New Thats All. I Don't Believe He's Sold Out. He's Still Going And Still Has That Voice. It's A Great Album...Just Listen To It...TO Real Mansonnites...You Won't Be Disappointed. RESPECT IS GIVEN TO HIM FOR THIS ALBUM."
1,Disappointing,I LOVED Marilyn Manson's older stuff. Antichrist Superstar was really an amazing album. He used to be this deformed brilliant iconic legendary hero from another planet; but a steady release of terrible songs thoroughly destroyed that. This album was really awful. It is actually embarassingly bad. It has potty mouth lyrics and a boring sound. It feels like a pathetic attempt at reclaiming his former fame.Just pretend Marilyn Manson died a poetic and memorable death and the albums after Antichrist don't exist.
1,Piece of Crap,"This is the g**est album ever made. Dont waste your money on this, instead buy an album from The Sisters, Bauhaus, or Christian Death."
1,upbeat manson sucks,"This is like all the crappy fast upbeat songs off mechanical animals and holy wood, I only bought those for the slow, depressing songs. Melancholy Manson is cool, rockin out party time Manson sucks. Antichrist superstar is awesome though. So I guess angry Manson is cool too."
4,marilyn manson returns,i have every cd that he does and i think this is some of the best work there is very few songs on this cd that suck but not many overall it is a mix of his death dtyle with a rock edge to it so how much more should i say about it.
2,Quit While You're Ahead,"Marilyn Manson probably should have quit music after his crowning achievement, Antichrist Superstar. At least that way the Mechanical Animals embarassment would never happened. Golden Age of Grotesque is proof that Manson at the very least should have called it quits after Holy Wood. Everything here is derivative, not just of Manson's past music but the themes of other performers today. It's pretty obvious that this is the artist wallowing in his self-magnificence and nothing to please the fans who have put Manson where he is today. Buy it if you have a compulsion to own every Manson recording, but even then I'd get it used. Of course, this album sounds like it's been pretty used already, and not in a fun way."
4,BRINGING BACK THE ROCK!!!,"Marilyn Manson starts out hard and continues to rock with his latest album! This is the New [stuff] is only the beginning of yet, another, great Manson album. Mobscene was another cool tune, also the single. Although, I wasn't sure whether I liked it or not, it doesn't become quickly catchy and not in the usual commercial way of most songs. With the exception of a few songs, I pretty like them all. I must admit that Holywood I was somewhat disappointed, after all the hype. I didn't know what to expect after hearing this was his best album yet. Now, I do. Golden Age [is great]! Oh ya and it came with a free dvd film from Manson that scared the hell out of me. It was the strangest stuff I've ever seen. I wanted to complain but it was free, plus the album made up for the dvd making me sleepy, entranced with subliminal messages and scared all at the same time. As for the cd buy it and crank up the tunes! If you got a decent stereo you won't regret it!"
4,TIM SKOLD ALL OVER THIS!!!!!!,"What can I say, I love Tim (KMFDM). This album did not disappoint me at all. Mari and Co. made a funky groovy record.Glad he's not really as ""EVIL"" as every one thinks (Herr Doktor). Though...Tim Skold is a downright nasty mofo."
4,Marilyn Manson is not dead.,"What can we say? Marilyn Manson has returned to top of the Billboard charts and the front row of your local newsstand with what may be his best since Antichrist.Golden Age is superb. John5 has some smoking guitar licks, and you can hear Tim Skold coming through as a great addition.... Doll-Dagga, and Vodevil are my favorites so far. Pouinding, much harder than Mechanical Animals, and with as much sonic depth as Holywood.Marilyn is headlining Ozzfest this year and most of the 40+ white, drunk, old school metalheads are in for a surprise. Marilyn Manson has returned as the reigning Pope of Rock N Roll."
1,Yea... Whatever...,"If you are a industrial rock fan and you own this album, you should be ashamed. This album isn't worth [...] to most industrial music. It's missing the complete vibe with syths and keyboards.Manson needs to get back to the old days when he was edgey and sick. ACS and PoaAF were by far his most poetic and incredible albums. This sounded like something a random kid with a computer made up the syths and added to screaming and bad guitar playing. (Which is still better than most bands.) In short this album wasn't worth a 3 year wait. Get back to what you know Manson!"
2,?????????????????????????,I have mixed emotions about Marilyn Manson's latest album. He has seemingly gone a completely different direction with his music. I honestly don't know what to think about this one. All I can say is that you may have to base your judgement on how big of a fan you are to him and how open minded you are about music.
4,Not F**kin' Bad at all!!!!!,"I have only really been a fan of Manson's for like two years now (Prior to that, he scared me, but i never gave him a chance)and actually Holy Wood was the first Cd I bought of his. After hearing that, I went and bought all of his other CDS.This by far surpasses Holy Wood! I got it on the day it was released, and listened to it through at least three times since. I just recomend this to any Manson fan, and anyone who is willing to try something different."
1,Horrible,"Marilyn Manson's worst CD yet. I really don't like the whole industrial rock scene. Tim Skold has little to nothing talent. Too bad Twiggy left, he may have made this CD worth listening to. Although, Use Your Fist and Not Your Mouth sounded pretty good in concert. This CD needed a better bass player, Some good solo's, and Marilyn's old touch."
3,Eh mechanical animals is better,"I like it don't get me wrong but I just dont listen to it much. It's stuck halfway in between normal metal and death metal which should be a good thing but it comes out all weird. I can't really mosh to it and the lyrics dont have the fomer genious that was manson(save for doppleherz that comes with it). Use ur fist and not ur face...so...catchy, poppy, uhh not usual Manson but still...the lyrics are awefully shallow for manson. Whatever happend to the genious that was coma white. So sad. Come on Trent you're supposed to step in and make sure this stuff gets fixed. And cummon just because a person is a satanist don't hate him unless he hurts your cat. and manson isn't even a satanist he's just a satanic reverend. Anybody can be a musical artist regardless of their beliefs."
3,Kinda disappointing...,"I have never really liked Marilyn Manson, I've always thought that he was shocking simply to be shocking and that he was just a gimmick. I wasn't really into his music either. With that said, me giving him a three is really quite the compliment; coming in cold and not knowing much of his material I was remotely impressed. However, don't be fooled. The alleged Weimar Berlin influences are mainly superficial and have little to do with the actual cd. This is sonically the same music MM has been making his whole career. Which isn't necessarily bad, just not ""revolutionary"". The lyrics are very intelligent and border on sophisticated. However, don't be duped into buying this on the fact that it is new and exciting; listen a bit first before you lay down your cash. A decent cd."
1,Good Music To Sleep To,"Okay, i'm ready. Got my ear plugs, boom box, and i'm sitting in bed. This should be great. I'll just stick these plugs in my ears and play ""The Golden Age Of Grotesque"". I enjoy doing this because MArilyn is such a positive singer. GREAT MUSIC TO SLEEP TO!!! (dont forget the ear plugs)If you like Aaron Carter and Nelly, you're sure to love this new and improved cd by Marilyn.Remember, if you're looking for good music to sleep to get this album. It will make you feal better when u've got this blaring in your ears while you arent awake.My favortie Manson Cd So far. Keep up the good music buddy.!! i love this guy i saw him on Conan, hes hillarious. The blend of the soft screaming and yelling is great in his work. Thanks Marilyn!!!"
4,Fairwell jon 5!!!,"It was recently annonced that this is the last manson album jon 5 will be apart of.SAD.But onto the music,this probably isnt the best manson album,but a damn good one at that!!Probly the heaviest,most brutal manson album too date and a must have for fans.Good luck jon 5,you will be missed!!!"
3,"Twas OK, but doesn't pack the punch the others did.","There are a number of things wrong with GAOG, one being the vast quantity of uninteresting guitar, bass, and drums... Don't get me wrong, there are a few nice guitar riffs, but not many. With Twiggy gone, the bass doesn't do ANYTHING new/different. Manson also doesn't sing at all except for (s)AINT and another track I think, which didn't matter with AC Superstar, cuz that cd rocked, but... I dunno what it is, even the rhythmic screaming doesn't quite cut it. To sum it all up, it's much better than the horrid rock out there now, but not nearly as good as his previous work. I'd recommend either AC Superstar or Holywood over this."
2,NOT IMPRESSIVE!!!,"okay, I had been waiting for a while for Manson to release a new album. The anticipation was killing me. But needless to say, as soon as I listened to the c.d. once, I was devastated. For me, Manson has been an inspiration. Everything he puts in his songs have meaning, emotion, and an addictive vibe that makes you want to keep listening. He has done a lot to change his appearance over the years, but he has still found ways to top himself. This album is everything that classic Manson is NOT. Most of the songs just sound like he's out of ideas and just making up stuff. For example: Doll Digga Buzz Buzz Ziggity Zag is a very fast paced, heavy song. But the lyrics are just too goofy and childish to be Marilyn Manson. If you are buying this album expecting ""Anti-christ Superstar"" or ""Mechanical Animals"" type content, DO NOT BUY THIS!!! But if you are ready to hear the once named ""American Antichrist"" sing about sappy, kiddy, meaningless crap... feel free to waste your money."
3,A fairly disappointing effort.,"This album seems to me to be a mixture of Mechanical Animals and Holy Wood. The sound has about played itself out. With so many other bands out there mimicking the Manson sound he has seen fit to change the sound and feel of the albums.Unfortunately, these changes, while understandable, do not necessarily make for an enjoyable album.The album is neither good nor bad, I'm fairly indifferent to it. It's fine for background noise, but I can't imagine sitting down and actually listening to it.A note: If you like earlier Manson recordings (Antichrist and before) but not the two albums mentioned above, you should probably save your money as I doubt you'll find anything compelling on this disc."
3,Great album when it's not edited,"The Golden age of Grotesque is the first Manson album I ever bought, and it remains one of my favorites. The songs are heavy, and full of anger, but the lyrics are not as dark AcS, MA, or Holy Wood. The only swear words that are edited out of this cd are f***, and s***, so you still hear whore and bitch. If you have ever heard an edited album, then you know how annoying it is. I would suggest you buy the explicit version instead, if you can. I only bought this version because I am a minor and I was alone. I would give the unedited version 4 1/2 stars."
5,MASSIVE,"You wouldn't pick me out of a croud as a Manson fan but I've been around long enough to enjoy a variety of different types of Rock, Alternative Metal, Goth Metal and Progressive performers. Manson is virtually in a class by himself and this CD is dense-packed with that MASSIVE sound I've come to know to be His. If you've not purchased a M.M. CD, start with this one. (Runner up selection I'd say, the live CD ""Last Tour on Earth"", which captures great version's of earlier song's.)"
1,THE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE DESTROY THEIR STEEPLE,"Marilyn Manson should get into film making.His themes and imagery are mind blowing especially on this latest album.For that reason it gets a star.It is his best art work yet!However his music has reached a dead end.This album is his last two albums revisited.It is less melodic but the dynamics are the same as is the vocal delivery.Lyrically there are some clever ideas but it borders on contrivance.Although Bowie has covered the Berlin period and the flirtations with Nazism MM takes it to another level but still, special effects and creative production can not disguise sub standard songwriting.Music should essentially be about good songs.Theatrics are secondary.Give me Torniquet,Coma white or The Nobodies any day."
1,The album title is right,"I even heard about somebody naming their hamster after Marilyn Manson. But the trouble is they believe it's sqeaking wheel sounds better than this pile of trash! Marilyn Manson takes to putting on as much make-up as wacko Jacko, but children like his image though, and I guess kids are his mainstream audience now."
1,his worst,"i regret it so bad that 2 years i spent 15 dollars for this piece of crap. i hate this sound, i hate the concept, i hate the songs, but not all of them.saint,bright young things are pretty good but the rest is bad.i seriously know a lot about manson and i have all of the albums and this along with the last tour on earth is the worst. i very much prefer the old school sound of portrait of an american family and smells like children.also mechanical animals and antichrist superstar are very good too.but ever since,mm has been on a downward spiral.sad,but true."
4,bring back twiggy :(,"i think it was a wonderful album, wasnt his greatest but it still lived up to the beautiful music i've come to expect from marilyn....the only single fault i could find with it is...i miss twiggy!!!! twiggy ramirez was awesome, and it wont be the same without him with marilyn"
3,"It's not 'Suck!"".. It's just not ""The Best""","well.. this is kinda a late review, cause i've been having this cd for like a year now.. I think this album is a bit different from Manson's old work. There are some good songs like This is the new (...),mobscene,use your fist,spade.. It's just that, almost everysong in this album sounds VERY ALIKE! If you listen to this album non-stop (from track 1 till the end), when you hit track 11 you'll think ""Didn't i listen to this one before??"".. It sounds very alike, no variety.. And i don't really like the new bassist Tim Skold, i think Twiggy is WAY better.. Get Holywood, or Mechanical Animals or Anti-Christ if you want Manson's better album.."
3,It is catchy but lyrics are lacking,"Well for all the Manson fans that enjoy Portrait of American Family and Antichrist Superstar, you will be bored of this album quickly. It is a nice refreshment that he went heavy again but the lyrics are very... well lacking. I do have to say that the songs are catchy. In addition, I still say Mechanical Animals is his worse CD. I know some may disagree saying that it his most thought about CD but it is just too soft. Holy wood is literally in the middle in the way that it still has good lyrics but heavier than Mechanical Animals. Therefore, if you are a big Manson fan, as I am, it is a good addition to the collection but don't expect it to be a favourite."
3,Good stuff but ...,"I really expected the new Marilyn Manson LP the last year ... I heard it so many times and i loved it ... But then I thought that the CD was not so great as I thought the first time I heard it... It has very good songs (Doll-Dagga.. Use Your Fist .. Spade.. But the CD has one of the worst MM songs that I've ever heard (Ka-Boom ka-boom wtf is that? In Antichrist, Mechanical Or Holy Wood the worst song title was Cryptorchild lol, (S)aint goes boring...). Maybe, if Twiggy (Jeordie White) returned to the group, they'd make a great CD as Antichrist, Mechanical or the best of all, Holy Wood, but with Tim Skold, the darkness that had manson, went away and the group became more ""industrial"". After all, its not a bad CD, but it's the MM worst I think"
3,Marilyn Manson-'The Golden Age Of Grotesque'(Interscope),"Decent 2003 release from this industrial metal band of Alice Cooper wanna be's.Never thought Manson would last THIS long.Keep in mind that I got to see them play live four(4)times on their first two major tours.The disc here is okay,even for old Manson fans(like myself)as the tunes I found somewhat entertaining were the outrageous ""This Is The New Sh*t"",""Use Your Fist And Not Your Mouth"",""Para-Noir"" and the heavy duty ""Obsequey(The Death Of Art)"".I saw the guys on this tour as part of our town's annual 'Freaker's Ball' event and after a couple of delays and just two songs,the concert was called off.Problem was the crowd of 10,000 morons couldn't understand plain English when the security was asking everyone to move just two feet back.Guess it's time for some of them to go back to school."
2,"O Manson, where art thou?","When I heard Manson's previous album, Holy Wood, I started to get the feeling that the ""Marilyn Manson"" formula had set in, and it was nothing more than a rehash of the brilliance he showed on Anitchrist Superstar.I hoped I was wrong, however The Golden Age of Grotesque only confirmed what I was thinking. It seems as if the energy and originality Manson once exuded has reached its peak. Now he's at the plateau, and I fear there is no redemption to come from him. I do like the pictures in the liner notes, even though there also nothing entirely new from them (however, I'll give them a star). For me, the sad truth is Marilyn has hopelessly fallen into the ""Evil Rock Guy"" shtick. He wants people to fear him for his devilish persona, but all I'm afraid of is his predictability."
5,Best CD of 2003,"After being bored of mainstream music for years, along comes this masterpiece. Can't stop listening to it."
4,Manson has done it again....,"I found this album rather interesting....It seems like Manson lost a little of his lyrical edge he is known so well for. While it still is an excellent album, I'm not sure if lyrically it matches up to ""Mechanical Animals or HolyWood"". Musically this album is great even after the departure of former bassist/guitarist Twiggy Ramirez.Manson also includes a DVD, directed by Manson, it is exactly what you would expect from him. While I watched it I was completeley mesmorized. Though, I don't think I'll watch it more than once in a great while."
5,Great album.,Manson still proves he has what it takes with this killer album. Better than any corporate garbage on the radio.
1,Piece of ****,"Saddest attempt of a metal album I've ever heard. I thought Linkin Park MTM sucked but this was just bad. The only highlight of this album is tracks 2 and 3 and thats not saying much. Don't waste your time buying this pointless ****. Instead listen to real metal like Iron Maiden, Slayer,Deicide,Darkthrone,and Witchfinder General."
1,Marilyn Manson has left the building,"Manson's new album GAOG lacks a lot of things, originality, emotion, things that used to be part of their music. Personally Holywood (In The Shadow Of The Valley Of Death) was a much better album, even though fans and critics alike considered it a disappointment. Manson's musical roots are no longer present, due to the departure of longtime bassist and songwriter Twiggy Ramirez. In my opinion the band will not last much longer."
4,cd good bonus dvd bad,"I really liked the cd, it was missing twiggy (sigh) but thats life and the music goes on. It wasn't as angry as some of his last cds and seems to be a bit more artistic... I did not however like the bonus dvd... It was a waste of time , I kept waiting for it to lead into someting better but alass it did not and I was greatful when it had ended it will not be worth watching again, no wonder he put it out with the cd if he had tried to sell it on it's own he would have been left with piles and piles in the landfill...but the cd was good and worth buying...just skip the dvd...:)"
3,"A ""happier"" Manson back to his industrial roots...","Overall, a good buy. The album is a bit top-heavy, with the best songs all among the first 7 tracks, but the best five songs alone are worth it. Mobscene, This is the New S**t, Use Your Fist, Not your Mouth, and Saint are among the highlights. The music is a more like Antichrist Superstar, while the lyrics are more like Mechanical Animals. This is also the most upbeat Manson CD. One gets the feeling this record was a lot of fun to make. The Rose McGowan references are brutal and hilarious...a great song to think about your ex-girlfriend to! :-)"
4,Greatness,"Manson is one of those artists whose musical style requires the listener to listen to his music several times and let it grow on them. It's addictive, put it that way.Radio seldom does justice to his songs, so don't base your opinions on what you hear on teh radio. You'll only be half listening and won't be able to pick up on the subtlties.On Golden Age, all the songs are more or less pretty good mosh-alongs. If a little contrived in places, this is fine album, easily his best. Because Manson re-invents himself with each album, you can't compare it to any of his others because they're all different. You've got to look at them all as debut albums. If this is a debut album, it's pretty damn sharp.Buy it. It's very good."
4,Awesome,"The lyrics don't compare to Antichrist, but what does? It's [an] awesome cd. I really lurve it! Rock on Brian Warner!"
3,...,"well after listening to holy wood, antichrist, and portrait, i thought he was improving with age with holy wood the greatest to date. i enthusiasticaly bought the cd after hearing this is the new sh it off the matrix 2 s/t. i thought it was unfitted on the cd but was still great. when the cd arrived at my house i put it in and was very dissapointed. i know that manson and co. could put out so much more.. there were some great songs like mobscene nu shi t and Doll-Dagga Buzz-Buzz Ziggety-Zag but songs like (s)aint with worthless lyrics brought it down. if your a huge manson fan get this but if your just starting to get cds i recomend Holy Wood which is my personal favorite.. better yet get a Nine Inch Nails cd.."
3,"Dirty, Dirty Rock Starr...","Okay. I will give Manson's new attempt at this cd 3 stars. Where he tried to do something very new Manson and creative, he just didn't take it in the right direction. We've heard him at his most morbid point, Antichrist Superstar (a well deserved 5 stars), and his most electronic, Mechanical Animals (also a well deserved 5). And then, Holy Wood, (another 5) which was an amazing twist back to Antichrist-type music. I'm not sure wether I should headbang, whipping out glowsticks, or dressing up and doing the swing to this cd. And, this is coming from a HUGE fan of everything else Manson has done. There are some songs which are good, one or two that are great.. and the rest..If you are a new Manson fan, do not start here. Start with Portrait of an American Family, and work your way up. Along the journey from Portrait to HolyWood, you're bound to pick up Manson at his best."
2,his worst,"Absolutely the worst album of Marilyn Manson. I am a big fan of his music but I must say that. Buy this CD only if you need it desperately for your MM collection. It contains only a few not bad songs like (s)aint, mOBSCENE, Para-Noir and Vodevil and even those songs do not make this album worth of bying or even listening second time. It is a huge disappointment. Never expected such a weak album from such a great performer."
2,Generic and disappointing.,"I STILL love all three of the last Manson albums, and was really hoping this would be a culmination effort, what with new member Tim Skold (supposedly) reinvigorating the recording and creation process. Instead, this is plain BORING! Listen to the music underneath and imagine it without vocals. In almost every song I could hear this being another in a long line of industrial nu-metal bands that all sound the same. Sadly, we now add the name Marilyn Manson to that group. I guess the loss of Twiggy Ramirez is more pronounced than anybody would have thought. Outside of ""Mobscene"" and ""Ka-Boom"" rocking like the Manson of yore, there's nothing here I haven't heard too many times before. Mary's unique lyrical and vocal approach is not enough on this effort!"
4,Best MM since Antichrist,This is just yummy! I haven't stopped listening since I got my CD on Tuesday. Lip-smackin' good! Thanks MM!
5,Perfect...just perfect.,"Today I bought the album and all I can say is it's awesome, a dark, misterious and beautiful piece of art. Every song has it's own spirit an intensity, Tim Skold is now a essencial part in Marilyn Manson's music and sound...i'm very glad that he make the Manson family better in the music aspect of course.I think is, or could be, Marilyn Manson's best album to date.Everything in the album is envolving and makes you beg for more...from the CD art (which is incredible) to the last song, i love every bit of the record.I really recommend everybody to get the Limited Edition copy with the DVD, you'll now what i'm talking about once you get it.Marilyn Manson really shows what it takes to make an album perfect...""The Golden Age of Grotesque"": you need it, you have it, you want more...Amazing album..."
2,This album is an insult to Manson's talent.Okay not great.,"Whatever happened to the brilliance of his top 3 albums(Antichrist Superstar,Mechanical Animals and Holy Wood In The Shadow Of Death? This album is to me just an uninspired version of Nine Inch Nails' Pretty Hate Machine(which rocked by the way). No matter how much you liked Manson's trilogy I strongly suggest you avoid this album no matter how much you like Marilyn Manson.What happened to the master works that were Tourniquet,Man That You Fear, Lamn Of God,Burning Flag,Coma White,The Last Day On Earth,etc? None of the songs on Golden Age come close to being as good as the songs in his trilogy.If you want a hard rocking,finely produced album I suggest you stick with Marilyn Manson's Antichrist and Holy wood as well as Nine Inch Nail's masterpiece The Downward Spiral.And if youre looking for an easily accesible poppier sounding album just stick with Manson's Mechanical Animals and Nine Inch Nails' Pretty Hate Machine."
4,A Major Improvement!!!,"This is my 9th Marilyn Manson CD and it's a lot better than others! My favorite songs are This is the New S**t, Mobscene, Use Your Fist And Not Your Mouth, The Golden Age of Grotesque, The Bright Young Things and Para-noir. Still, my two favorite Manson Cds are Eat Me, Drink Me, and Lest We Forget! If you are a goth and love Marilyn Manson, you'll love THE GOLDEN AGE OF GROTESQUE!!!"
5,His funniest album,I still give this a 5star rating because it's just a great albume to jam too.....This isnt his best effort lyric why's at all but it could be consider his heavyest album at the same time....Just buy it for the fun part of the cd offers catchy songs and just kinda in your face lyrics.....(Not amazing though)
3,TWIGGY????? :(,"Unfortunately, it is obvious that TWIGGY's musical influence is missing, which is a great upset......sounds like a cross between ""Mechanical Animals"" and bad KMFDM. Listenable, but not his best."
1,Just When you thought it couldnt get worse..........,I was ready to give this album 2 stars because there are about 3 songs on this that I liked.The Music in almost all of them are awesome until Manson opens his mouth.But It was when I watched his 26min. DVD that came with it is when I decided...this CD/DVD Package does not in any way deserve any stars.The DVD is nothing but manson repeating lines over and over.Anyone who likes the DVD seriously needs to grow up and get there head checked.But I will say if I ever find an Instrumental of this album ill buy it.But other than that I have Vowed to NEVER buy another Manson CD again.
1,Hahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahaha!!!!!!,"Marilyn Manson=s***ty nu-metal, NOT goth metal or shock rock! Manson is nothing but a poseur, and if he does things the least bit offensive (i.e. cover a fan in meat) it's considered shocking and scary. I bet if you guys went to a Mayhem concert, you'd s*** your pants, as Mayhem do live animal sacrfices on stage and make Manson look like Mr. Rogers! Also, want satanic? Listen to Dimmu Borgir, Shagrath (DB vocalist) makes Manson look like a school quoir boy."
1,This One Sucked Worse Than Holy Wood!,"I Know what your saying your probably thinking it wasn't that bad.Think again this was the worst manson album ever made!I mean it is so bad i would give ""Holy Wood"" A 5 Star rating!i'm sorry but I just depise this album.I may be a Kid but I can give you good advice! DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM! A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!"
4,Not bad for a beginner,This book provided a great deal of useful information on general accounting and business financial practices.
1,Old styles,"I am disappointed in this book. The patterns are very old styles.However, it has some useful bacis pattern making information. If you are a beginner, it is helpful."
4,very easy to follow,"I am taking a course in pattern making and sewing at the dubai Art Centre.I thought that if I bought this book it would help me understand pattern cutting more.I am a clinical pharmacist, but I paint, write, draw , sew and cook. I also make rag dolls and do embroidery.I found the book very easy to follow and some things were made in a way that is easier than what my Chinese teacher taught us.I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning dressmaking.Dr( Mrs) Tanweer Mahmoodullah"
2,The worest published Shounen-ai I've read,"Honestly, it gets me annoyed that DMP would actually consider these titles ""Yaoi"". Do they even know what Yaoi means?! These titles are more shounen-ai than yaoi.""Desire"" was a huge disappoint. I feel like i wasted my hard earn money.Like the previous reviewer stated, DMP's translations suck. The whole ""Mr..."" part is a very obvious one.The only good things about this manga were the art and the very rare fluffy parts.Things were under-developed, the story and the characters.It's a cheap-flake-off to get money. If you know someone who owns a copy, read it first before you decide you want to buy it."
5,The book offered a good entertainment.,"Even though you may think the content is simple and/or hollow, it is still very enjoyable and worth to buy."
3,romance novel with pictures,"that's exactly how i'd decribe this title. don't get me wrong, it's a great story: full of angst and self-discovery. and to get it all from toru's pov is so rare. if you're after a little more romance than 'action' this is for you. a good first-yaoi title."
3,A tepid schoolboy drama,"After reading the book's blurb, I expected deeper characterization and a more emotional plot. But most of the manga focuses on Toru as he whines to himself about feeling used, and frankly Ryoji *does* come off as a creep half the time -- often tricking Toru into coming over to his house, then practically forcing sex. But it's supposed to be 'okay' because Toru really does love him, even if neither of them seems to want to say so. The reasons for this lack of communication between the two boys is a bit fuzzy, also adding to the overall staleness of the manga.On a scale of ""1"" to ""10"", the Re-read-ability of DESIRE is a ""6"". I'd look at it again for the sake of the art, which is certainly pretty enough. But the story is fairly been-there-done-that without any fun or new twists to make the plot more interesting. For fans of hotter yaoi manga, the love scenes aren't all that either."
3,It was Good.,"Good story, it was a bit slow at first- but altogether it was good. The story is a bit confusing at first, but it's easy to see that this book is not for people under 15 atleast. With the explict content and the artwork I was wondering myself why I bought it, but everything played out in the end. Very cute ending, its a must read, if you can take it that is. :)"
2,Disappointed,"The other reviewers have the plot summarized pretty well already, so I won't bother with that. My main problem with this book is the translation. It's horrible. The language is stilted and awkward. You can figure out what's going on, but there's no subtlety of phrase here and nothing like the English anyone actually speaks. In a story that rides alot upon the uke's inner-dialogue, this awkwardness of expression really makes it hard to relate to what he's feeling. This is also another title where the Uke stammers ""NO"" and ""STOP"" throughout the first time the main characters have sex. Why the publishers think quasi-non-con is the way to go with so many of these books, I'll never know. I know that if you're looking for English Yaoi you've got a limited number of titles from which to choose. This one should be a sort of last resort."
2,Not one of the duo's bests.,"Unfortunately, the plot of ""Desire"" struck me as formulaic and predictable: Toru is a sensitive art student who is in love with his good friend Ryoji, miscommunication, angst, and tears ensue. The characters left me emotionally cold, and the plot was rather boring. Despite all this, I am still a fan of these authors' works (check out ""Kiss Scandal"" and ""Rin"").As the previous reviewer SDW also noted, Digital Manga Publishing has bolded one word out of every speech bubble. I think this is a bad pratice: they have selected for the reader all the so-called ""important"" words and left little for the reader to interpret."
4,Customer Service - 360 degree!,"Never mind the bricks or mortar, the book has the right focus; how to serve customer better. Besides concepts, it gives examples in detail. You would get that urge to go and try some of the ideas in your own stores."
5,We love it!,"We purchased this set a month ago and totally love it. It's the same as one we have at our timeshare, so we knew already that we loved it before we even bought it. It's durable, classy enough to serve company, and things don't stick to it as much as they did to our previous dinnerware. We bought two service for 4 sets (Fiestaware Cinnabar)."
5,Attractive and durable,"My husband and I purchased this 16-piece dinner set to replace our old dishes. So far, we're very happy with our Fiesta ware. Everything arrived in perfect condition. The plum color is incredibly striking and the quality of the set is excellent. I love that Fiesta products are designed to mix and match colors, and there are so many vivid shades to choose from: it's definitely not your standard boring dinnerware! I look forward to adding more Fiesta products to my collection."
5,Makes my heart sing!,"I have always loved the looks of Fiesta, but have never owned it. For our 40th anniversary we decided to treat ourselves to a new set of dishes that would be just for the two of us. We ordered the Fiestaware in the Persimmon color, and we love it.The quality of the dinnerware is just right for everyday use; sturdy and fun. And the color--it really makes my heart sing."
2,"Great dishes, wrong ad","I love these dishes. The color is exceptionally pretty. Received my shipment fast and in perfect condition. However, the product description describes receiving a mug, and the picture shows a mug, but I received 4 cups (smaller). The whole reason I ordered from Amazon is so that I could get a mug with my set of dishes. The department stores in my area all sell cups. Not too pleased with this!"
3,fiesta dinnerware,"I am quite pleased with the price, and condition of this item! I am looking forward to purchasing additional pieces for service, as well as other household products."
1,Just buy it in the store...,"I have previously ordered a 16pc. set from Amazon last year and it shipped and arrived in perfect condition! However, this year I went to order a set for my mom for Mother's Day and when it arrived the dishes were damaged, scratched and defective. Thinking it was just a factory fluke we returned the dishes and exchanged them for another set. The second set arrived and we were disappointed to find that these too were damaged, scratched and defective. I love Fiesta, but they way these dishes are packaged and shipped was disgraceful. You're better off to just buy them in the store and check them for yourself."
1,Fiesta,"The Fiesta 16 pice service for 4 dinnerware was more orange than Scarlet in color and the qualitity of dishes was cheap. Sent back, bought locall for half the price, scarlet (red) in color and of better qualitity!"
4,"Love the bowls, Hate the cups","The plates and the bowls are very nice in this set. Durable, nice glazing. However the cups are very small, not even 8 oz. The color of the cinamon is pinker than pictured---Almost a raspberry color.shipping was remarkable quick."
4,We're Happy,We are very happy with the Fiesta Dinnerware. It is simple and fun to use and with so many additional pieces you can create a great table setting! We mixed colors to match our kitchen perfectly.
3,"Nice, but shows scratches after little use",I bought several fiesta pieces and all of the dark ones got scratched after little use.
2,Never again!,I have about an 8 place setting in the Fiesta already and was obtaining this for a Halloween party and it can be used with my other pieces during the year. I ordered this set and the first set had a bowl broken. I had to wrap up the old set and ship it back since you would not replace the one broken bowl. The second set came in with 3 pieces broken and I decided not to order anything breakable from you again. I did not try to return it since the first order also had broken items. Seems that you do not check the boxes since it was already marked as having broken items underneath your shipping label. Mega China has mailed and delivered Fiesta to me for years and I have never had a broken piece until you guys. Kari Britt
3,Disappointing finish on the red set,I already have a set in green and orange. The finish on the red is disappointing. White showing on the rims of the cups. I do not know if that is to be expected but I do not like it.
5,great book,"You really should credit the author of the text in this book, an excellent essay by the noted art historian Carter Ratcliff. The book is about Donald Baechler not by him. It also contains an informative interview with the Viennese Linguist Martin Prinzhorn. Mostly pictures of flowers, if you like flowers. Also contrains a great bibliography and chronology of the artists life. review by Chris Kellley"
3,not the real magic dust recipe,"This book is pretty good, the best of the two books I ordered. The main reason I ordered this book was to get the recipe for ""magic dust"" that Mills is famous for. So I put some together and put the rub on some ribs I then smoked the next day... Not great. Then I turn on food network and what do I see? Food Network is proclaiming Mills as having the best ribs in the country due to his magic dust that has 16 different spices in it. The ""magic dust"" in this book only has 8. It is orange due to the extremely large amount of paprika where the real magic dust was a yellowish color. The book is okay, but dont believe the hype that he gives away any secrete recipes, most of the recipes you could think of yourself (put pulled pork in a baked potato or a stuffed pepper)"
5,Lip Smackingly OUTSTANDING!,"I've spent several hours reviewing PEACE, LOVE and BARBECUE by Mike Mills and Amy Mills Tunnicliffe. Just the chapter on the ""Secrets"" would be worth the price of the book. Additionally, the ""Magic Dust"" recipe will leave you wanting to run to the store and make up a batch just to shake directly on your tongue! The book just isn't a ""recipe"" or ""cook book"", it's all about what people think and do for the love of food and not limited to barbecue either. This book will set you straight on many ""urban legends"" and point your smoker the right direction in how to smoke a lip smacking brisket. Loaded with nostalgic photos and neatly put together, I just can't say enough about the whole book. Probably one of the first books I've read and associated the titles three words!"
3,Peace Love and BBQ,Great price for the book.Not as informative as other books I've bought on Smoking.
4,A Fun BBQ Read,This was a fun read about part of the barbeque world. I also learned a few tricks and recipes.
3,Okay but not what I expected,"This book was a good story about Mike Mills and his exploits as a barbecue master. There are recipes in the book, but I felt let down that there wasn't more information on cooking techniques and secrets. There is a section in the back that goes into some detail, but relative to the size of the book it wasn't much. This book wasn't at all what I expected."
4,Great Gift!,"My husband is a griller. He doesn't need a recipe book - he cooks what he feels like based on what we have around. He loves coffee table books though - things that other people pick up and flip through because they're kind of cool to look at. He also likes to talk to people about grilling - and grill with his friends to pick up tips and tricks. This book is one part coffee table book and the rest tips and tricks. This was a big hit with him because its so packed with interesting facts, tips, techniques, and a few recipes dabbled throughout. This is not your ordinary recipe book - its more like the history of BBQ from one man's family. We love it! Just wish the weather was warmer around here right now to spend more time at the grill.PS: This isn't a book for gas grillers. ;)"
3,"So, so.","I did not find the book all that useful. It was somewhat entertaining for the love of que, but if one is wishing to learn how to BBQ, then this book is not for you. It would not be in my top ten of learning how to cook bbq."
2,PR Stunt,"Ok, so there are some good BBQ recipes in here but no better or that different than 5 other books I own. What I didn't want to pay for was page after page of how great and how famous and what a legend the author is. If someone else wrote the book and and mentioned him that way it would be more palatable, however, it came across as a huge PR stunt for the authors restaurants and ego."
1,Good read,I really enjoyed reading PL and BBQ. Mike and his daughter put together a fun social read along with many tips and recipe's. If you are interested in BBQ at all this is a must read
4,Christmas gift,"My father has found a love for grilling, smoking, and pretty much anything to do with these two activities. So I got this book and another one for him for Christmas, and he was sitting on the couch reading them that night. He loved them. It has great ideas, recipes, and even writing from chefs. He said that he was learning a lot, and couldn't wait to try out new ideas. Great gift for the outdoor cooker in your life!!"
1,Stupid Non-Giggles,My daughter's daycare group thought this was stupid...couldn't understand the humor & the guys were dumb acting not funny. No way that an eight year old would want to watch it. Ages 1-6 watched it & lost interest very quickly. I took it back & would be embarrased to sell it or give it away.
1,Moronfest,They should make a video where the Wiggles get hit by a bus. This is the type of mindless enterytainment that causes low test scores.
5,The best for children,"This video is top notch. I have a daycare & when I found this at Costco, I had to get it. All the children love it. Including my 14mo old & 4yr old. They all stand in front of the TV & do all the dances. Doesnt even compare to Barney at holding everyones attention. THIS IS A MUST GET MOVIE FOR ANY CHILD!"
5,A Silly and Happy Video,"My 2 year old daughter simply LOVES this video. She dances, sings and laughs when she watches it. This is an excellent video that is easy to follow and keeps your kids happy. I recommend it!"
4,Where's the Monkey Dance?,"The only reason that I bought this video is because of the preview on Barney's Christmas movie. My daughter kept rewinding the video to ""do the monkey."" When the tape arrived, no monkey dance! My daughter loves it anyway, but there should be a listing of the songs I can look at before I buy!"
5,Helps children with disabilites!!!,"My 6 year old daughter has autism. Well her docter said to buy her videos that have alot of singing and dancing to help her with her motor and physical skills. Well we saw the Wiggles video at the store and bought it for her. In the past year she has learned to dance,talk,and so much more.See her doctors told us she will never talk, her physical skills are improving everyday.Just by watching a video.To me the Wiggles are a God Send.My family and I have Hope for the first time in a long time.Thank You Wiggles !!!"
5,"WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL!","First of all - get over the Do The Monkey not being on this tape, buy the other one - they are cheap enough! Now onto the good stuff, 3 kids (ages 20 months, 5 and 8) and 2 grown adults love this tape! The Wiggels and Barney are in a dead run for first place in our home. We have video taped the kids dancing and signing to this tape and those precious memories will be great when they get older. I dare one child or adult to sit down and watch this and not start singing, dancing, or even toe tapping. I find myself at work humming the Wiggles songs now instead of Barney - thank goodness. We still love Barney but after seeing all of his tapes over and over and over it's a nice change of pace."
5,Love it!,My 18 month old daughter loves this video. I love that this video had children up off the sofa and moving! Perfect for rainy days.
3,Wiggle Addict,"My 2 year old is a confirmed Wiggle addict! He can watch this DVD over and over if I would let him! The song portion is about 40 or so minutes and he loves it - especially the priate dance. Also has two episodes that are about 10 or 15 minutes each; so if I just want to occupy him for a little bit these are good (but are usually followed by a chorus of 'more wiggs, more wiggs, more wiggs PLEASE!)I on the other hand am becoming a wiggle burnout and feel as if I might go insane if I have to do the Pirate Dance one more time!"
4,The Wiggles-Wiggle Time,"It was worth the wait, and my son who is 22months loves it and I can not get him away from watching the tape, especially the Quack Quack song ... It kepts him busy thank goodness!"
5,I would recommend this video for any toddler!!!!,"I bought this video for my daughter when she was one year old. She wasn't very interested in it then. Now, at 2 years old she LOVES it and will sit in front of the TV and put the video in and jump up and say Yeah, Wiggles!!!! THis is the BEST Wiggles video. She really isn't interested in the other ones as well as this one!!!!!! A Wonderful video to add to any toddler collection!!!!!!!! I would highly recommend this video to keep your little one entertained!!!!!!!!"
1,disappointed,"I bought this video because my son loved the Monkey Dance previewed on Barney's Night Before Christmas video, but to our disappointment Wiggle Time was a flop. This video may be more suitable for children ages 4 to 8. I think if the children were involved in all of the songs this video might have had a chance with my kids."
1,Boring!,"Wiggle Around the Clock was the first DVD we bought and it is great! Lots of up beat, energetic, catchy tunes. The songs make all of us want to dance and put big smile on all of our faces. We went to buy more, since this is the greatest thing to our little boy, and purchased Wiggle Time and the new, Bananas one. Wiggle time is boring and slow and only the live songs at the end make it watchable. It couldn't even keep my son's attention for a minute where the first one makes him go into a zone and he won't take his eyes off the TV. The new Wiggles go Bananas is computer generated and the songs are worthy of one star. We went through every song on both of the DVDs and agreed that our son will probably never watch either again. Waste of money!"
5,"""GET READY TO WIGGLE""!!","It's time to wiggle and giggle with 4 sweet colorful guys-the Wiggles. I have always loved Greg the Yellow Wiggle even though I also love Murray, Anthony and Jeff.Wiggle Time is a music video type of movie with songs that include, ""Here Comes A Bear"", ""Captain Feathersword"", ""I Love It When It Rains"" and ""Get Ready To Wiggle"".My love for the Wiggles grows strong, every day."
3,A little disappointed....,"I bought this video based on positive reviews from other Amazon customers. On the package it recommends the program for 1-8 year olds. The 3 year old in my house jumped right in and started wiggling during the 1st viewing, but lost interest after about 4 songs. The 5 year old didn't want to dance, and showed very little interest. Can't imagine an 8 year old admitting to want to dance like a pirate. Maybe better suited for a rainy day indoor video. The songs were cute, but lost a bit in the Australia lingo, American translation. We have an Australian brother-in-law, but still wondered what a wompat was...The singers are energetic, the production colorful & basic. At the end of the video there is ""live"" concert bit, with the audience clearly enjoying themselves. I'm hoping after another viewing or two, if we learn some of the words to the songs the video will grow on us."
2,Misleading,"Were introduced to The Wiggles from a Barney tape. My son loved the Monkey Dance. It turns out that that song wasn't even on the video. No catchy tunes on this one. The singers have nice voices, but can't act. The scenery hardly changes throughout the tape. We were very disappointed. It's a dud! I would like a complimentary copy of the tape that includes the Monkey Dance, as I was led to believe that it was on the tape that I purchased."
5,Your little one's gonna loooooove it!,"I'm totally satisfied with this dvd. I bought several wiggles at a time. and this! this is the one of best dvd to me and my little girl(22 mos old). 'Rock-a-bye your bear','Here comes a bear','uncle noah's ark','Quack quack' are my daughter's favorite. I'm sure this is also top dvd of tots. Moreover, there are three live songs - 'wave to wags', 'five little ducks(sung by murray), 'wiggle medley(?)'.I fell in love with these guys and their passion for tots. I really appreciate their efforts and what they've done. Every moms should buy this for their little ones."
2,My toddler is bored with this video!,"I bought this video because of all the great reviews. My 16 month old LOVES the Wiggles but she does not like this video. It is old.... it was first released in 1999, though on Amazon it says 2004. The backgrounds are really cheesy, and the songs are older. I am now off to find a newer, more entertaining Wiggles video. If I were you, I'd do the same!"
2,"Catchy songs, tacky visuals","Okay, there is something to be said for the wiggles. The songs are catchy. But in my opinion, these songs should have been recorded to cd's, and the dorky visuals should have stayed ...The children we know that like the Wiggles, never liked them instantaneously. For example, ... our neighbor, used to protest at their appearance before his Barney tapes, but after about watching his Barney for the 50th time and seeing the previews so much, he finally was okay with the Wiggles.My daughter ... also didn't take to the Wiggles right away, and it's never a tape she opts for on her own, only on somebody else's suggestion.We prefer to choose the videos that are an instant hit, and as long as a child is not obsessed with only one video, then it is easy to see if the entertainment is successful on the first go.Bottom Line: Dorky and overstimulating."
5,My son's favorite video,A wonderful video for active kids ... my son loves to sing and dance along. Perfect for those looong snow days at home!
5,My Kids Love It,"I have three children, ages 5, 2 1/2, and 14 months and they all love this video. It is a fun and lively music video that brings out the best in them. It is a joy watching them sing and dance together. My kids were already familiar with the videos from the previews on the Barney videos. As with Barney, there is nothing here for adults. On the other hand, try dancing to the Wiggles with your kids and you have yourself a nice aerobic workout! Highly recommended for children 8 and under."
5,Grandson loves it,My grandson plays it over and over. He just loves it! It helps my daughter-in-law to get the laundry done. lol
5,3 Thumbs Up,"I love this video! My 3 children (triplet toddlers) can't get enough of it. They sing the songs and have learned many of the dances and they are not quite three years old. The characters are charming, the songs are delightful. If you're looking for a video that will get your child stomping, jumping, clapping, dancing and singing, this is the one. The Wiggles ""Yummy Yummy"" is equally good. As my kids like to say ""More Wiggas Pease!"""
5,Excellent for toddlers,"My 19 month old nephew has been watching this tape about 4 times a day since I got it for him. Sometimes he gets the whole family up and dancing with him. Very enjoyable for adults as well, and this is from one adult who can't sit through Barney. This Wiggles tape is a must have!"
4,Great exercise for my 3 year old!,"What a welcome break from Barney! My daughter and I have so much fun watching the video together and I, of course, have to do all the dances with her so it keeps me in shape as well! It's a great video to have fun with. However, I was looking for the Monkey Dance and didn't get it with this video. A list of songs would be helpful! This video is highly recommended!"
5,"My son calls it ""My cool movie""",We saw the advertisement of this group on a few Barney tapes. Every time we saw it my son would get up and dance. I loved the idea of a video that would keep him busy for a while but that he didn't just sit on the couch and watch. Every time he watches it he gets a work out. I love this video and it makes me feel good to let him watch it(even sometimes twice in a row). My daughter who is 15 months is also dancing (or wiggling) to the video.
5,The Wiggles - Wiggle Time,"We found the Wiggles on the Barney Halloween video. My 5 year old daughter and 18 month old son fell in love with the monkey dance. The next week we went out and bought both Wiggles videos. Both kids love The Wiggles and their funny songs. EVERY DAY my son finds the videos to watch at least once...The Wiggles have taken the #1 spot away from Teletubbies and Barney for him. They both know the dances and even Daddy has his favorite songs. The Wiggles are a kick and a refreshing, new and fun video for our children! Our family loves the Wiggles and definately recommend both videos for kids who love music and to dance & sing!"
3,Monkey Dance is on the other Wiggles video!,"The promos at the beginning of the Barney videos are wrong. The ""monkey dance"" and the ""hot potato dance"" they claim are on the ""Wiggle Time"" video are not...those songs are actually on the ""Yummy Yummy"" video. Your children will probably still like this one, but check out the other one, too. My daughter (22 months) can't get enough of that one."
5,I STILL CANT STOP WIGGLING!,"This is such a great video. My 2,3,and 4 yr old just love it. I bought 2 of their videos and would definetly suggest that you get it. They love the Duck song, especially the quack, quack part. They love to sing the songs even when its not playing, and so does mommy! They even help teach your kids coordination and balance, plus keeping them dancing constantly while watching."
5,By far one of my Favorite Wiggle DVD,"If you get just ONE Wiggle DVD, this would be it. Good fun songs, nice intro of all characters, background and props are decent (not cheesy like the old dvds and not fancy like the latest ones). Highly recommended."
2,Benny..Where's the punch?,"I bought this album not long after hearing the album he did with Jack McDuff called ""Dynamic""(Prestige records-PRLP-7323)back in 1964,now out-of-print.I was taken by the arrangements he did for McDuff and expected more of the same punch he delivered. Boy, was I wrong. Aside from 'A Sweedish Villa' it sounds as though everyone in the band was taking a vacation and was asked at the last minute to do a recording session.Having cut my teeth on Basie and other swing era big bands, I was just hoping that this album could resurect some of the dynamics of that time. But alas ""NO"".Benny Golson would later put out some fine albums, but this one wasn't one of them."
1,Not Lisa Papineau's Pet,"Don't make the same mistake i did. Even though this ""band"" is named Pet. It isn't the same band that sang ""Lil Boots"". This ""Pet"" is a horrible britpop male fronted band not fit to shine Lisa Papineau's boots. This cd is dated 2004, years after the real Pet broke up. You've been warned."
5,A Joseph Hill Masterpiece.,"This album, though made in 1982, still displays the lyrical power of Culture's 70's output. Two songs in particular Elijah and The Rasta Man stand out as gleaming examples of Hill's power to move through words. The whole album is strong both lyrically and spiritually and is more representative of Culture's spiritual side than the rest of their 80's output. Lion Rock came out before the breakup of the group and catches them close to their peak-still telling tales of the sufferer stuck in Babylon(Babylon's Big Dog and We Deh Ya Still)and the strength and power of faith.Worth your time."
2,Comparatively weak,"With so much great Culture reggae available, this rather weak and uninvolving effort should be sought out by completists only. It sounds as though Joseph Hill is coasting on this effort, but he would recover."
4,A Traveller's History of Australia,"If you're going to the Olympic Games in Sydney Australia in September, this book will provide the background you need. The author takes you from the aboriginal Dream-Time, 53,000 years ago, to the booming cities of 2000. If you want to know why boomerangs return, how in the early days of settlement many ex-convicts became millionaires (legally!), where is the world's largest flat surface, at which battle in the Vietnam War the Aussies killed the Vietcong 15 to 1, why Canberra and not Sydney is the capital city, when Australia experienced a military coup, or who is the cricket equivalent of Babe Ruth, this is your book. There is also a chronology of the main historical events and, useful for visitors, a historical gazeteer of the main cities and tourist spots."
4,A SuccintTraveller's History,"A condensed, concise history from from earliest human occupation to the modern times. It was interesting to see the contrast of the development of the colonies in Victoria, SA and WA with the original settlement. I felt the book gives a much wider view of the Australian persona."
5,Should be Required Reading,"This is a very good introductory book for anyone interested in learning about Ancient Greece. It covers all the major points of Greek history from the early days of myth through the death of Alexander the Great. All the important events and individuals are mentioned in enough detail to avoid being superficial. At the same time the author spares us the minute details to avoid being too academic and boring for the casual reader. In a nutshell, this book is everything a non-scholar needs to (and should) know about ancient Greece provided in a succinct, easy to read format."
3,Not for digitals,"Contrary to other reviews, this has nothing more than a paragraph here and there for digital SLR cameras.General astrophotography info. Very general."
1,I am disappointed,"I feel nothing but disappointed...I was expecting to watch some essences of Academy Award show for last 30 years, but I got nothing but the shortfilm of nominated movies...Totally different to what I expect..If you have same expectation as me, which is just to watch the ""orginal"" award show and their acceptance speeches, DON'T BUY IT"
2,Meh...,"As somewhat of an Oscar historian, I found this rather uninteresting. I donated it to my local library. Almost nobody checks it out."
4,"Sharp, convenient, but a little heavy for the pocket.","Overall design of the product is sound. The blades that come with it are sharp and good quality. The handle seems like it's going to hold up long term. However, there have been two instances where the switch that opens the blade storage in the handle has been activated in my pocket. The blades did not fall out, they also appear held by a magnet, but it was a bit disconcerting to know it was a close call. I've taken to keeping this in a belt pouch since, which also better distributes the heft."
5,"Really sharp, easy to use","This knife is really sharp and the blade stays in place, unlike my previous knife. It also has a great grip. The only thing I don't like is the plastic tip protector. It only goes on one way and you have to be very careful putting in on."
4,great knife,"Great knife to have in a print shop. A little dangerous on its snap when closing the blade (I have since scrapped off the edging around the blade entrance's finger zone in a warning pattern). Also blades of different sizes can wobble inside the blade-lock area and a piece of tape on the blade will stop thate nicely enough.What I like most about this blade though is its grip. it doesn't have that hard feel of pressed plastic or metal. It also has enough curves for a variety of grip positions.Way better than standard issue, break off blades. This changes faster.Watch your fingers! NOT for beginners"
2,Good idea but not rugged.,I purchased this knife to use at my job. I loved the storage and design part of the knife but upon moderate use the knife it cracked on the handle splitting it in two. I purchased a metal utility knife and it has yet to fail. Do yourself a favor and purchase a metal utility knife it will be safer for the user.
4,Fun but tricky,"I last played this when I was a kid, and I found some cases easy and some hard. The first was in ancient Egypt, which was fairly easy, just mummifying a pharoh correctly and decoding Carmen's note to her associate. The second was in Rome, and included fixing the plumbing. I had the most trouble with that! It continued with getting the Vikings their ship back, bringing the moon's light to a Japanese writer's room, doing errands for William the Conqeror, etc. They get harder and harder. I lost the discs before I could get any further than the sixth mission, but I'd really like to have it back and see if I could complete the missions now. I advise you to buy it and while you don't really use your history skills, you do have to think outside the box and use logic! All that and it's fun!"
1,Conflicts With Windows XP. Caused System Crash.,Not happy with this card. Caused system crash. Messed up the configuration files. Toll free support was not good either. Reprentatives don't understand you well and will ignore your questions at time. Spent too many hours on phone with tech support and didn't solve anything. My card is still not working. Tried card on another laptop and didn't work again. Files are not communicating and conflict with hardware and software.
3,just a brief note,"I purchased the book on-line without having a chance to look inside, mistaking author's name with another well-known namesake.I was disappointed for the level of all the problems collected because I was expecting much higher level of problems.For students of science and engnieering majors, however, it is without question a great exercise book supplemental to any text book.It provides a great deal of exercises for solving for solutions but very few of exercises for proving problems."
3,Too basic,"I bought this book for very cheap so not a loss. But unless you want just mid-undergraduate level problems, this book is very basic. You should look at other books if you want to get problems on advanced calc materials.On the otherhand, I would recomend this book for someone who is begining with calculus"
4,It engaged my mind,"I hunkered down with this book the weekend Hurricane Frances was creeping across Florida. It helped to keep me distracted from the uncertainty of waiting for the storm to arrive. I even did some of the exercises. Here is the product of one of them:Portrait 09-05-04(with posthumous apologies to e e cummings)Hurricane Franceshas passedwho used to bea category 4with winds of a hundred and tentwentythirtyfortyfifty miles per hourin the eastern Caribbeanand what i want to know ishow did you like your eye-walled stormMr. WeathermanBut even if there is no hurricane in your immediate vicinity, this is still a good book to read, especially if you are one of those people whose blood runs cold at the sight of a blank sheet of paper (or a blank computer screen)."
3,Great Idea But Tough Read,"It's like broccoli. Good for you, but you don't enjoy eating it. Rico has some great ideas for tapping the creative power of your ""right"" brain, but you need to be fairly ""left"" brained to read the book without dozing. I think her ideas and techniques ARE effective, but the book reads like a college text. Also, the book is clearly written with the poet in mind. Most of her examples and exercises center on poetry. Other writers will probably walk away from the book feeling a little left out and wondering exactly how to apply her techniques to longer forms of writing (i.e., short stories and novels). Still, if you've ever had trouble writing because your left brain overpowers your right and forces you to hit the DELETE key after every other sentence, then this book will help you establish balance -- if you stay awake long enough to finish it!"
3,Just go girl - or guy,OK as pep talk for getting started at writing or just changing your head so that you're not just repeating yourself or bogged down on organization.
5,Get rid of writer's block and reach your creative potential,"To anyone who writes, especially fiction, give this book a try. I've used the techniques for the past two years and report AMAZING results. I'm sure you'll see the potential of these techniques with the very first exercise!Esentially, she shows you a different way of thinking - using the ""right brain"" - which helps you tap the creative and unconscious."
3,not a movie review,"THIS REVIEW DOES NOT APPLY TO ""Will it Hurt Doctor? - Gall Bladder"" MOVIE...I decided to post this review of Amazon Instant Video service because I didn't even get a chance to watch this movie after purchasing it on September 1st. Tried watching it today, September 14th and it was showing as if I never paid for it. No, I didn't start watching it when I just bought it because I didn't have time. So, the 30 days window should be in effect and it isn't. Contacting Amazon about it and will keep you posted on the outcome..."
4,Ok players guide.,This is the Strategy Guide for the old version of the game.I bought it only so that I could see what the old graphis for the game looks like.It was an ok book for its time.
2,What a mess of a book!,"I bought this book because of the ratings and because it was an author I had never read. Well, I won't be buying another one of Mr. White's books after reading this one.The story line included a bunch of sub stories that really didn't have anything to do with the main storyline. (Spoilers ahead!!) A son who had ordered his own paternity test. An ex lesbian lover pregnant with Doc's child who turns out not to be an ex lesbian. A neurotic best friend that has a promonition that Doc is dying while in the middle of surgery and puts himself in a drug crazed coma to reach out to him. And on and on and on. The book starts out with a bang and then loses it entirely and never picks up speed again. I would say 50% of the book's writing does not belong in the book and doesn't add to the storyline. I only finished it because I hate not finishing a book, but this was ridiculous.I won't bother recommending this book to anyone. Sorry."
3,Disappointment,"As a big fan of all Randy Waye Whites books until this one, I thought he was trying too hard to be sensational. All previous books had more depth thanks to Tomlinson and many unusual but believable characters. This plot line was confusing and White's heart didn't seem to be truly involved. Was it a pot boiler?"
2,I've read better,"I am certainly a fan of this genre of novel; however I have found Dark of Night so full of superfluous material, which has no bearing on the plot itself, that I am tempted to wonder if Mr. White is being paid by the word by his publisher for his output.I know he can do better than this."
2,Disappointing,"For anyone listening to the audio book version, you'll wonder where Doc, Tomlinson and the gang have gone. All the work that Dick Hill did in creating the marvelous residents of Dinkin's Bay that we've come to know and love has disappeared in this novel. This RWW book definitely not up to par with the others. Did not come close to making ""my favorite"" list."
3,Not Randy's Best,"I, too, try and read all of Randy Wayne White's books. This one, however, was lacking in character development -- especially that of the quirky players of Dinkins' Bay marina. Also, the plot was a bit gruesome. It wasn't enough to turn me off of future RWW books, but I'm hoping his next one has more heart to it."
4,Doc is back,"A much better plot than the last two entries in the series, and it is fun. White has created a couple of memorable, monstrous villains in the last couple of books and left them alive. Will we see them again?Doc Ford's domestic situations continue to be a puzzle for such an intelligent hero and the weakest part of the stories."
4,Great Suspense Novel,I have written many reviews of White's books because I have read every single one of the series. He writes with significant intelligence about southern Florida and especially it's marine life while keeping the reader in suspense with the tale.
2,"Nice, but the design rubs off.","I bought this zippo as a gift for my father. It was really nice and the ship design was beautiful. The zippo still works perfectly and is durable. However, I am disappointed because the design appears to have ""rubbed off"" little by little only after a few months time. There is no longer any design where you would hold the lighter and only the very edges of the lighter have remnants of what use to be drawn on. Therefore, I am very disappointed and feel embarrassed that I gave it as a gift."
4,Product as described,I like this product. Fast shipment. The Scrimshaw Ship emblem is very nice. Due to the slight movement of the lid I could not gave a 5 stars.
3,Kinda Big,"This is a sturdy, good quality case....it is just too heavy when you get it loaded with your equipment. It is also big and I am constantly bumping into things with it."
4,Good quality product,"I pondered over getting a Prada or Gucci then came across this product. At about 1/15 of the price, I'm quite satisfied and it serves my purpose, which is carrying bulky multiple-keys and conveniently slipping in my cell phone, with my laptop, and also I can slip in my coffee container on the right pocket which fits perfectly, and also a couple of thin office files. I am not a fan of made in china product, and I was somewhat pleasantly surprised to see it was not made in china. Anyway I am overall very satisfied with the product, and it doesn't look cheap so you will not be embarrassed to carry this around to any place. Only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it does not have any inside zippered pockets inside. Most people would be ok with it but I wish I could put something inside like my check books and SD card etc., that wouldn't fall out of the pocket."
2,Does not fit 17 inch laptop,"Even though the description says it does, this is a lie, if you are looking for a case for a 17"" laptop skip this one. I had to return it."
1,I am completely disappointed in this product,"I am completely disappointed in this product, the finish is very bad inside as it does not even ensure the laptop, the material is very ugly."
4,what about jimmy?,"the first 3 songs on the album are far from triteza's unmistakable sound. the absence of jimmy lavell is so recognizable that the songs almost seem incomplete. the next 4 songs are breath taking, jimmy's appearance is even noticable in track 5 which reminds us of past albums.this new ep definately shows how much the band has evolved into a slightly different groove with emphasis on a more jazzy/experimental perspective. the interwinding soundscapes created by the melodic guitars are barely present at all. the changes are not for better, or for worse, but simply changes. this is a wonderful album,but almost by a completely different band. if tristeza has been a past favorite, i HIGHLY recomend this album. if your just getting into tristeza, start with older albums and work your way up."
3,Wonderful songs and lots of fun if you can ignore the hideous puppets!,"The songs on this dvd are great! My 12-month-old especially loves the ""Do the Monkey"" song, as well as ""Hot Potato,"" and ""Fruit Salad."" All the songs are catchy and the sets are simple but colorful. The reason this one doesn't get 5 stars is due to the awful puppets that are dressed to look like the Wiggles (in 2 songs). They are not only ugly, but a bit scary looking with their huge unnatural eyes. My older kids think the puppets sing hilariously with their chipmunk-type voices, but I would rather have seen the real human Wiggles perform these songs instead of those ghastly puppets. So, if you choose, just skip past the puppet songs and enjoy an otherwise excellent and entertaining show!"
2,"eh...just ok, I would return it if I could",I bought this DVD because my daughter loves the fruit salad song. I was not expecting creepy puppets on the show. Maybe once or twice but multiple times...I didn't like that. Didn't seem to bother her but they kinda creeped me out. Defintely not a dvd that will go in her normal rotation.
3,Yummy-Scary,"My toddler (2 years-old) loves the Wiggles, especially the food songs on this dvd, but she freaks out whenever the puppets appear! She is quite disturbed by the scary looking puppets that perform some of the songs on this dvd. I have never seen the puppets on the tv show. I have to watch with her and fast forward whenever the puppets perform, which is a slight pain in the neck. Otherwise, great songs on this dvd!"
5,"If you have a pre-schooler, they will wiggle!","I am a family daycare provider, and discovered these videos through one of my daycare families. They are wonderful; the kids ask for them as soon as they walk through the door in the morning! They are a colorful, fast paced, dance-able romp through a variety of kids' songs. They are like Barney and Raffi all rolled into one. I highly recommend them if you have toddlers through kindergarteners; they all love The Wiggles!"
2,The Puppets are too scary,"Everytime my 2 year old sees the puppets in this video, he asks that the video be turned off because he says they are too scary. But he likes other portions of the video, especially the Monkey dance and the Fruit Salad songs where he actually dances to the rythyms."
2,Disappointing Wiggles Video,"My 15 month old son loved ""Wiggle Time,"" so I bought him this video and ""Wiggly, Wiggly World."" ""Yummy Yummy"" was very disappointing--it has a couple of bizarre, creepy segments using Wiggles puppets who sing like the chipmunks. My husband also wasn't thrilled with the guys dancing around like ballerinas during one song. I would recommend other Wiggles videos, but not this one. It didn't please us or our son."
4,Freaky Puppets but my kids love them!,"After listening to the Yummy Yummy cassette, I bought the video to watch my kids dance. Although the cassette has many more songs, the video is very appealing (except for the freaky puppets, but it is for the kids, and they think the puppets are funny) and the wiggle men are quite energetic and really get my kids, ages 4 and 18 months, up and dancing. Although, one number has me scratching my head - for some reason, during he Hebrew song Havenu Shalom Alachem, they feature dancing Oktoberfest girls instead of say, perhaps, an Israeli theme. Didn't make sense to me. Then again, it's for the kids and kids didn't seem to notice!"
3,Who the heck invented these evil puppets?,My daughter loves the Wiggles. She also seems to enjoy this video. But I must say that the paper mache puppets on this video scare the...whole family!
4,Great!,Great entertainment for the little ones. My 2 yr old son LOVES the Wiggles and he even sings along to the songs. He doesn't know all the words but you can recognize some he says!
3,Get rid of the Puppets!!!! Please!!!!!,"Our first Wiggles tape was very well received by our 20 month old son. I bought the second tape (to prevent burn out) The Wiggles - Yummy, Yummy. He loved everything except the puppets... way to scary!!!! He cries when the puppets come on. The spinning colors and puppets look like a BAD-ACID trip. I couldnt' blame him... I was a little taken back myself. The puppets look really demonic!!!! I and my son love The Wiggles... but please, no more puppets!!!"
2,The Wiggles--Yummy Yummy,"I first saw The Wiggles at the beginning of a Barney tape and they sang Quack Quack. My 9 month old loved it. I purchased Wiggle Time which he loved. The songs were upbeat and he would watch the entire show without moving. I purchased Yummy Yummy thinking it would be just as upbeat but the songs were not as good. They were slow and some of the words didn't fit the music. Also, ..., the puppets are scary."
3,"OK Video, but not the best and creepy puppet faces","My son went through this HUGE wiggles phase and I bought him several videos. This video was not the worst, but certainly not the best. There are segments with puppet like characters to represent the wiggles and I found them to be creepy. My son didn't seem to notice, but they really were odd looking and I would rather not show my son creepy wiggles faces with HUGE bulging eyes. if that part were removed, the video would improve!"
5,Great DVD,My 15month old daughter loves this DVD.. she knows all the dance steps to every song.. she wakes up in the morning and first thing she wants to do is dance to the wiggles.. I recommend this to anyone.
2,not as original,"My 2 year old and I love the Wiggles. Couldn't wait to get a DVD , so we can replay faster and easier. Unfortunately, I can't stand this 'yummy, yummy' DVD. What I love about the wiggles is its uncomplicated, unpolished setting and sounds. There are no high tech tricks, no lip sync-ing and you feel as if you are in the same space as the Wiggles. Not this DVD. The sounds are un-natural and the settings more contrived. Buy 'Wake up Jeff' instead!"
2,"""I hate the puppets!""","My 27 mo LOVES anything Wiggles, but I can't play this anymore because she's terrified of the puppets. She almost cried and wanted to be held a long time after seeing them. Two weeks later, from time to time, out of the blue, she still says ""I hate the puppets!"" I have told her that we won't play the puppets video anymore - no more puppets."
2,Not for our family,"We LOVE the Wiggles. The Wiggles was the first show that my baby boy showed any interest in at all, and he's been watching them over a year now (He's going on 21 months). We have 13 different Wiggles DVDs that we rotate for him. But, unfortunately, we had to give this one to the Goodwill. He loves the whole DVD - except for the Wiggle puppets. He backs away from the TV with a horrified expression when they're on, and as I'm usually trying to get things done when he's watching the Wiggles, it's hard to make sure I'm there to fast-forward past the 2 puppet songs. I find myself wondering, as much as I love them, why they did these scenes at all. They are rather scary."
3,PUPPETS?,"This movie has at least a few good songs, but the puppets arehideous. my favorite song ( go, captian feathersword ahoy)has these puppets. it ruins the song and the entire cast from thewiggles are losing money every minute the puppets are on air.so if you're looking forward to that and ' can you point yourfingers and do the twist' then you will be upset because it hadthese squeaky puppets. i haven't heard my sister re-act, becauseshe hasn't seen it yet. just skip the parts with puppets."
2,They've Made Better!!,"This is my and my son's least favorite Wiggles video. It's slower moving then the rest of their high energy videos.Unlike the others that he sits or dances through in their entirety, he lost interest quickly with this one.Also - portions of the video that have the Wiggles as PaperMaiche dolls with big eyes (creepy looking) singing superfast send my 2 year old screaming for me!!"
3,"OK, but the puppets need to go...",My two boys constantly want to watch Wiggle Time. I bought Yummy Yummy to get a break from Wiggle Time and we're disappointed. Yummy Yummy has these strange puppets in it that spook my almost 3 year-old. The Hot Potato Song is the best song on the video and that is on the Wiggle Time video...so I recommend skipping this tape and sticking with Wiggle Time.
4,Great fun!,"This is the video your looking for if you've seen the preview on Barney video's of the Wiggles. This has the Monkey song on it. My kids (5 and 21 months)think these guys are wonderful. They begged for the tape after seeing it advertised on Barney. We went looking for it at Toys R Us and with no luck came looking for it here. Thank goodness I found it and the kids get up and dance and sing with it. Its great. They can even spell DOROTHY, you'll see. Even Dad and I find ourselves singing the songs. I plan on buying Wiggle Time soon for them as well. This is for sure a tape that won't sit around, it will be watched a lots of times..."
2,mostly good wiggles stuff as per usual but....,"I Bought this for my son(20 months)who adores the wiggles, wags, henry,etc. I was in dire need for some new wiggles entertainment, Both Wiggly party, wiggly bay (great Videos buy the way) had become old hat. S0... I purchases Yummy Yummmy.Great performances by Greg, Murry, Anthony, and Jeff when they were on, but WHAT IS UP WITH THOSE BIZZARE PUPPETS SEEN ON THE VIDEO FOR MORE THAN HALF OF THE RUNNING TIME? I could understand maybe for one short song, if I knew the bizzaro puppets were on the video that much I would have used my money for barney:)!"
3,What's up with the puppets?,"We LOVE the Wiggles, but the puppets are strange-looking and take up too much time in this DVD. If I owned the video instead, I'd have this large section edited out!"
3,creepy puppets!,"Overall, the video is OK, although a bit dated compared to some of their newer ones (we like Wiggle Time and It's a Wiggly Wiggly World). However, we only watched this video once because my 2-year-old son was TERRIFIED by the puppets! He woke up 3 times during the night, every night for the next 4 days after watching this video, crying ""I don't like the puppets! I don't like the puppets!"" This from a HUGE Wiggles fan. So, in my opinion, skip this video and get one of the others, or definitely skip over the 2 songs performed by the creepy Wiggles puppets. This video would get 5 stars from me if it was re-released without the puppet songs."
2,Yummy Yummy ... Yuck!,"While I must admit my 2 year old loves this video, I find it one of the most annoying Wiggles videos ever! I bought this one as my first Wiggles purchase because it has many of my son's favorite songs, but was very disappointed. The puppets are annoying at best, and several of my sons friends find them downright scary. The ""techno-wiggle"" song section is very out of place on a toddler video, and if my son would let me, I'd skip it every time. There are many better Wiggles videos out there, and if given the choice, I'd pass on ""Yummy Yummy"". Check out ""Wiggle Time"" if you want classic Wiggle songs."
2,Songs are good --puppets scary!,My 6 year old (who is afraid of clowns )did not like the puppets with the high voices. He was really afraid of them so we gave the DVD away. Next time I will check to see if the puppets are in the next one I buy. They could of at least used the Wiggles' real voices. A bit creepy I must say!
3,Hmm...,"Having never seen the Wiggles until introduced to them by a friend with a one year old daughter, I don't quite know what to say about them. However, my first exposure to these blokes was the song ""Point Your Fingers and Do the Twist"". This particular segment is frightening indeed, and is about the closest thing to an acid trip that I've ever experienced. From the psychedelic background, the creepy helium-voiced puppets, and random appearences from a crap, a dinosaur, some fish, a pirate, and some fruit salad, I don't really know what to think about this. Additionally, the song has a tendency to get stuck in your head for about 3 weeks straight, so watch at your own risk.Despite my misgivings about this video, the baby absolutely adores it and smiles and dances when it is played. So I suppose it can't be that bad, right? :D"
2,Nowhere near as good as the TV show,"I bought this DVD hoping it would be just like the TV show on Disney Channel, which my 23-month-old adores and begs to watch every day. It's NOT. This is sort of the low-budget, music only version. It also has these puppets which SCARE MY SON. I have to jump past the puppet songs when he's watching it. Why can't they put out a video that's just like watching the TV show?"
4,"OK, except for the ugly puppets","My 2-year-old son loves the wiggles & likes this video a lot. There are enough catchy songs on it. The only thing we didn't like were the 2 segments that had those awful looking puppets. Although it didn't seem to scare my toddler, I skip those parts anyway because I can't stand looking at them & hearing the voice they used for the music (high-pitch---sounds like it was being fast-forwarded).Anyway, still a good addition to our Wiggles collection."
4,FUN,This is a fun video. I think there is still a little too much dialoge in it but still worth buying.
3,Ok,"I was a little disappointed with the quality of this DVD (not the tape quality but the Wiggles quality). It was shorter than the other ones, and not up to the standard of their other stuff. Several times the lips didn't even synch with the talking. That being said, my undiscerning 3 year old still loves it and it is a favourite DVD in our house. Worth owning if you have one of the others and want another. I would get ""Wiggle Time"" as a first purchase."
3,I bought this for my 2-year old.,"She immediately loved the dancing and tried to imitate the movements. The dances promote good coordination practice which is why I bought this tape. The dance segments are short, which is fine, but in between are non-dance skits during which she quickly lost interest in this video. Perhaps an older child would appreciate these parts (the recommended age group is 1-8). The longest segments involve puppets that look like the actors. The puppets appear to be well made but show absolutely nothing related to bodily movement--that is, nothing that could be imitated. These segments disappointed us both."
3,Not the best Wiggles DVD - good music but way weird puppets,"This is the third in our Wiggles DVD collection and my third-favorite. It contains many great songs and the choreography is strong. Best ones include ""Shaky Shaky,"" ""Hot Potato'"" ""Fruit Salad,"" and ""D.O.R.O.T.H.Y.""The label also says it includes ""Point Your Fingers and Do The Twist"" along with ""Go Captain Feathersword, Ahoy!"" but only a closer look at the fine print reveals these songs are performed by PUPPETS. Not only that, the puppets' voices sounds like they are on helium and the tempo is sped up greatly.These two songs scared my 2 year old son, and we always have to skip them.My advice: get Toot Toot or Wiggly Safari but for the songs Yummy Yummy includes you could just set your VCR to playhouse disney and tape the songs you want."
3,Puppets can cause nightmares!,"My 16 mo. old son loves The Wiggles and really enjoys most of this tape. However, the puppets of The Wiggles in a couple segments cause him to start screaming and running for the nearest parent. I have to admit the eyes are pretty weird looking for a small child. I've learned to fast forward the two parts with the puppets and he's fine, but if you have a sensitive child you might want to wait until they're a little older for this particular tape."
4,Keeps my baby entertained - but no more puppets!,"My baby loves this video. We take it with us when she is going to her aunt's or grandma's house. But the puppets are scary! They are sort of demented looking and freaky. Hopefully they won't do that again! I too saw the preview on the Barney video and thought it was cute. (Had they put those puppets in the preview, we would not have gotten it.) She's not afraid of them, so we don't have to fast forward through them. But, she enjoys all the songs - except for a couple slow ones that she gets bored with. Overall, its fun and for the most part, danceable. I just ordered ""Wiggle Time"" and we'll see how that one goes. Another plus - this video has taken over for Barney and the Teletubbies (yeah!)."
5,My Children Love IT,"My children (18 months and three)and I saw the preview of the Wiggles on Barney's - Let's Play School video. That's all it took. They fell in love with the Wiggles and I knew we had to get it. My three year old sings and wiggles to their songs around the house as her little brother follows and copies everything she does. Its great way to get children motivated and actively learning about music and dance. You will even find yourself wiggling. ""Hot Potato"" is our favorite."
4,"great alternative to ""couch potato"" videos","The first time I played this video, I was a little disappointed that not every song had dance moves for the kids to follow. However, my kids (ages 2 and 4) loved it. They hop around to the music even if there are no dance steps, like with the songs done with puppets. It's a great change from Barney and Blue's Clues!"
3,Really- The puppets are scary!,"Just wanted to write my own review to say that our family loves the Wiggles and can sing pretty much all of their songs along with them as well as do the dance moves that go along with them. This tape is not as good as ""Toot Toot"" or ""Wiggle Time"". The puppets segments truly are weird and scary with high-pitched, teeth-grinding singing and gross-looking puupets with psychedelic (sp?) images. I bought this one for my one year old and her one year old cousin to enjoy while we were visiting over Easter and both of them were scared of the puppets and couldn't wait for that part to be over. Most of the time they would run out of the room to get away. Really obnoxious! The rest of the tape is good but we couldn't get used to the puppets and have trashed this tape!"
3,"Wiggles have catchy songs, yet a few annoying sequences","While my neice and nephew visited for over a week, this was the one video that was played (over and over) the most. The children love the music, and especially enjoy the octopus, Henry. I enjoyed it because whenever my neice was crying, she could usually be placated up by saying ""fruit salad"" whereupon she usually responed ""'ummy, 'ummy"". My only complaint, besides the inane Elvis impersonations, is the use of the puppets. These hideous creatures are supposed to resemble the cast of caracters. The sequence seems to be an attempt of remix, complete with vertigo swirls, and disco dancing reminiscent of ""saturday night fever"". The music of this scence is annoying due to a repetitous ""biee"" which is supposed to establish a beat. I can understand why the son of one reviewer was scared. The puppets made me want to run out of the room as well."
2,Did not care for this dvd,"I have only 2 dvd's and this is my least favorite. I would not recommend this one. The one we like is Wiggly Play Time, but that is the only other one I have seen."
1,Yummy Yummy,My 15 month old son loves the Wiggles...but did not like this video...he even cried when the puppets came on....he LOVES the Magical Adventure video...it keeps his attention and he loves to dance to the songs....me and my husband even walk around singing them!
3,Let this be last choice,"My 15 month old son is a huge Wiggles fan (we own 7 of their videos) and this is the one video that really didn't keep his attention 100%. The 2 puppet skits should have been cut out. I noticed that my son doesn't relate to the dorky puppets at all, not to mention, they are hard on the eyes and do not look anything like the Wiggles themselves. We have found that Toot Toot, Wiggly World, and Hoop Dee Doo are the best attention keepers. These 3 videos also have the best songs. Yummy Yummy is ok, but not great. Their other videos are way better. If I had to choose an order of preference, this one would come last."
3,The puppets are scary!,"My 20 month old likes the Wiggles, and, for some reason, so does my 5 1/2 year old. I don't mind them - the music is good and the production values aren't challenging. BUT - the puppets in this video are weird and scary. The kids don't mind, but they freak me out. On the positive side, there aren't alot of performing children in this one, which is a personal pet peeve of mine.I'm also a little wierded out by their version of ""Shalom Alchehim"" (yes, I'm jewish). It just feels to me like an inappropriate musical choice."
5,Yummy Yummy,My daughter absolutley loved this movie. She can now do all the dances and sing most of the songs. She has a blast dancing around the house with the Wiggles. A must have!...
5,Absolutely Wonderful!,"This is one of the greatest videos! I bought it for my 1yr old daughter - and to my surprise, my 4 & 6yr olds LOVED IT too! The singing never stops - the colors are vibrant - and its great exercise for the kids! We love it!"
5,he loves it!,"My little great nephew kept saying ""yummy, Yummy"" over and over to me every time I'd visit. I didn't know what he was talking about until my niece, his mother, explained it was a Wiggles dvd that his friend had and that he wanted. She had tried to find it, but had been unsuccessful. I immediately went on Amazon.com and was able to find the obscure dvd and it made my sweet Chase a very happy boy. He knows all the words to Fruit Salad, Yummy Yummy and now I do too.This dvd is obviously timeless since I can't get the tune out of my head and find myself humming it in waiting rooms where other adults smile and ask how I know the Yummy Yummy song. Everyone seems to know it.At the time, I had no idea it was a classic.Yes, I would buy this dvd again. And, probably will."
3,not that satisfied with this dvd,"My 22-month-old girl and I really like wiggles so much. Actually we enjoyed their songs through youtube. After I found their super hit songs are in this 'Yummy Yummy' dvd, I bought it immediately. BUT! I can't say I'm satisfied with it. 'Hot potato', 'Monkey dance', 'Fruit salad' are very very catchy and nice to sing along and dance, as you know. And 'Can you point the fingers and do the twist' and 'go captain feathersword' are puppets play, not real wiggles! and their puppets? very ugly.. though my daughter keet watching the puppet songs but I'm not sure what's in her mind. Anyway, I don't recommend this, but 'wiggle time' or 'Toot Toot'."
4,A delight for toddlers,"My son has been a Wiggles fan since he was just under a year old. The songs are catchy and not preachy, and it seems as though the older videos, such as this one, appeal to the younger children the most. The ones that are being made more recently, i.e. ""Wiggly Adventure"", are more movie-like and have less song and dance sequences which hold the tot's attention. This is an excellent video to watch on a rainy day with 1-5 year olds!"
2,Not so great - a disappointment for this Wiggles fan,"The video is nothing but musical number after musical number. I wish there were more vignettes to mix things up a bit. Also, for the price it is quite short - just over 35 minutes long. I agree the puppets seem creepy to me, but my son enjoyed them, esp. the Captain Feathersword puppet."
4,Motown & Didi,"this amazing piece of litaraure writen by Walter Dean Myers is an extrodinary view of the dicrimination involved in city life, and will be a good read for anyone who wishes to learn life skills involving city living, the perspective of discriminated African Americans or is interested in a truely facinating love story."
3,ok but sensitive to surges,"This worked great for our HD cable on Insight. Unfortunately, like the other reviewer the first thunderstorm to go by and it was dead."
5,Good seller,"Exactly what was ordered and quick shipping. Lightning can affect these hubs, so make sure you invest in a good surge protector. We've learned the hard way: This is the fifth hub we've purchased."
1,Silk shorts,Miss-marked (small) Way off on waist. I bought this pair and a pair of linen shorts and the linen was true to size and this on wasn't even close.
4,"heavy, geek tool","this watch is by all means cool, but it would be better if it weighed about 3 oz. less and had a built in stopwatchi love how all the apps for previious palms work on it and people are instantly impressed by its features.the worst things aresizeweightB&W; screen"
3,PDA watch heavyweight,I tried one of these watches with Mac OS 10.4.2. The version of Palm OS supplied would not install because of a permissions issue. Even if it would have the watch is far to heavy wih its metal case. Put it in a plastic case to save weight and improve on the battery life and maybe I'll buy one and keep it.
3,LOL!!,"you just gotta know how to play it! my brother and i found out that if you buy a dino, put it up for auction, then keep going to a different screen (i.e. the dino info page that has illustrations and tells you about the dinosaur), the bid on your dino will go up every time, and the auction wont end till you let someone win the auction! that's our ""get rich quick"" scheme. other than that, the only downside i dont like is once youre rich, your employees keep calling in sick. firing then rehiring them doesnt help. its as if you rehired the same person who got a fever."
3,"Just what I expected, old fashioned, bad graphics - was PERFECT haha !","Title says it all ;)Had to tweak computer to make it work, but other than that was great haha"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,OMG this is the most boring game in the world all you do is buy land which is very expensive if you wanna have a good park then you buy a dinosaur witch is half of your money they you have to spend 25.00 on one thing of food which it eats in like a day. so DON'T waste your money.
2,Unremarkable,I thought this book was unremarkable. I'm a kind of collector of books of ghost stories and weird happenings. I think there's better books out there. The author does go into the history of the events a little more than most.
1,Disappointing,"This was a disappointing read to say the least. The stories are short, 2-4 pages in length and not well put together. It was like listening to late night tales around the campfire. I have read scarier stuff in Nancy Drew Mysteries. The only redeeming quality about this book is that I didn't have to buy it. I checked it out free at the public library. To summerize, don't waste your time."
4,Ghosts and Haunts of the Cival War: Authentic Accounts,"The fact that this book claims to contain ""authentic"" accounts of cival war ghost stories is what attracted me to read it before choosing any other titles on the subject. I was disappointed that the author does very little in the way of explaining how he came to the conclusion that these accounts are indeed authentic. However, whether authentic or not, the book makes for good reading. I couldn't put it down! And for anyone interested, the book contains an appendix in the back with listings of places offering Cival War Ghost tours as well as Haunted Hotels, complete with addresses and phone numbers."
4,"Haunting, chilling and exciting to read!","Where would we be without a great ghost story? For anyone who loves the Civil War and a good ghost story, I can't think of a better book to sit down and read. From various battlefields to war ravaged towns stories over the years have come to fold and placed in this unique book. There are individual stories that allow you skip, go back or jump from chapter to chapter. The stories about haunts in Gettysburg and Vicksburg were exciting to read. I found this book entertaining to read and was intrigued by the stories!"
1,Plastic Junk,The Spectre product line is complete crap. All the air intake pieces are chromed PLASTIC garbage. I only reviewed it at 1 star b/c i don't think 0 stars are an option. DON'T BUY SPECTRE JUNK!
1,Smart Money Guide To Real Estate Investing,"two words: Don't bother! In a few more words...This book is a cursory look at real estate...it should have been trimmed down and used as filler articles. I have read a few real estate books lately and this one told me NOTHING new, it was a quick uninformative read.It never got down to the brass tacks. If you want to know what to look for in a property or how to know you're getting a great loan or price FORGET IT...you would probably be better off spending the purchase price on lunch with someone you know that owns a rental already. Oh yeah, some of the stats will make property owners feel good."
1,Worst realestate investing book read so far!,"Very superfical. More about purchasing a single family home to live in than investing. Obviously very little research was done, the writer does not invest her self."
2,Supposed to be a PHP-PostgreSql not Smarty-Pear,What's annoying about this book is that I bought it to learn more about PHP and PostgreSQL but the authors decide to use Smarty and PearDB throughout instead. If I wanted to learn those two I would have bought books about them. Smarty and PearDB is used in every single piece of code they do which is extremely annoying. I don't want to learn Smarty or PearDB. If you're trying to learn PHP and PostgreSQL don't buy this book. If you want to learn Smarty and PearDB this book might be for you.
3,"Big volume, lot of information","It is going to take me a long time to get through this tome. It is packed with information, reasonalbly well written. However, I feel that it is very verbose, things could easily be said in half the words used. That is a time waster, because you have to read through the useless stuff to get to the important stuff. Also, some sections might as well have been left out, such as the section on Postgres languages, there is not nearly enough information to get started. The book has too many words and too few good examples. Examples are not clear how to actually do, especially with the Postgres statements and commands. That said, there are not a lot of books about PHP and Postgres out there, so this is still very useful and I do recommend it as a read and reference book. I found Larry Ullman's books on PHP much more readable and useful as a learning tool, lots of good examples."
4,Excellent little book,"I am using this book as a review and the information and exercises are excellent. The only thing I am not happy with is that many of the add-in equations are tiny on my kindle and difficult to see (and I cannot zoom in on them at all). They also do not appear on my Kindle for PC at all, which is frustrating. If they could get that sorted out, this book would get 5 stars from me."
4,Never received the book. Thanks Katrina!,"I'm sure this book would rate at least 4 stars based on the other CliffsStudySolver books I own. The order was ""undeliverable"" and was returned to Amazon because my area was one that got hit hard by hurricane Katrina . Much to my surprise not only did Amazon refund the price of the book, but they also refunded all shipping costs including handling fees without me sending any emails or making any phone calls or having to argue with stupid sales reps in other parts of the country who refuse to have a clue as to what people in this area have been through. Talk about service! Thanks very much to Amazon for being so understanding about our situation here in south eastern Louisiana. Amazon has been more understanding than a lot of large local business entities in my area. I will always continue to do business with Amazon.com without hesitation whatsoever."
5,Super musicians,"Wow was I blown away by this CD. Feeling down, plug this cd in and let it play. Next thing you know you're smiling. Absolutely stellar uplifting music. I cannot wait to afford getting the rest of the Rodrigo y Gabriela music. OUTSTANDING!!!"
5,Great example of pre-dancehall reggae,"Big Youth is not well-known in the US. But he performed great reggae in an appealing ROOTS style (note- ""Roots Reggae"" would be equivalent to Otis Redding/Sam Cooke style R&B). The remake of Delroy Wilson's ""Dancing Mood"" will make you smile. ""Time Alone Will Tell"" is helped by an appealing harmonica solo, and ""Roots Foundation"" sums up the positivity that most of the reggae of the pre-dancehall (Reggae's present-day equivalent to rap) was all about. A very worthwhile purchase."
5,Compelling,"I attended a reading of one of Maile Meloy's short stories from ""Half in Love"" at the Getty Museum and was swept away. The title was ""Red"", a captivating tale of aloneness. While each of the stories takes the reader along swiftly and emotionally, there is a beautiful sparseness to Meloy's writing that takes the reader into her world before you realize it! And within seconds you are invested emotionally. I purchased this book immediately after the reading and planned to read one story a night...can't do it....One a night is impossible. They are too good to keep!"
2,Disappointed,"Although I really wanted to like this book, I could not find a single story that I liked. Stories don't need happy endings or all of the pieces tied together to be good, but they do need characters who engage you enough to provide an emotional connection. Unfortunately for me, I did not have any feelings (positive and negative) about the characters in these stories, and the plots were unsatisfying as well.Sadly, I cannot recommend this book."
3,"Well written, but sad","Maile Maloy is an exceptional writer, but Half in Love: Stories, like her other collection of stories, Both Ways Is the Only Way I Want It, is full of well-written, but sad stories. So if you want to be depressed, then Half in Love is the book to read."
4,Half in Love,"Product was delivered swiftly and in the advertised condition. No complaints on that score. (But I certainly could have done without the big ""USED"" sticker, which is proving a major challenge to remove from the book's hardcover.)"
2,"Promising, but...","Admittedly, my interest in Maile Meloy initially came entirely from my enjoyment of her younger brother Colin Meloy's band, the Decemberists. Meloy's debut short story collection is extremely promising in a lot of key areas: her stories have a strong sense of place, and she's got both a good ear for dialogue and a strong handle on narrative pacing. Things actually happen in these stories, in other words, something that can't always be said about similar short story collections. However, it seems that Colin inherited all of the family's sense of humor genes, as Maile's stories are almost relentlessly bleak and often downright depressing. A wider variety of emotional shadings would go a long way towards enhancing this collection."
5,An excellent teacher,"I began painting with the guide of this book. It's really a good help when you don't know nothing about oils and you want to start painting without a teacher. It tells you step by step what to do, the colours to use, the brushes and lots of other tips."
4,Numbers without the movies........excellent,I loved the goldigger movies..but also love the music. This cd hasall the music straight from the movies but it still wonderfull to have.Ear candy.
2,Weak,"After reading Williams' first novel, Four Letters of Love, I was certainly disappointed. Both the story and it's characters were simply weak. I felt as if I were reading a cheesy Danielle Steele romance novel."
5,Story telling at its best!,Nial Williams excels... you won't put down the book once you've started; the pace is slow in the begining but is rivetting at all times. A must read.
5,A different look at love,"I found myself puting this book down to savor its beauty...though perhaps the writing is a bit ""hit you over the head"" I enjoyed its clarity AND obscurity. That we never understand what love is, and that everyone can be afraid to beileve they are capable of love. I especially liked that Stefano never forced Gabriella--he wanted to make himself happy, and by doing so perhaps allowed her to be happy too. Happiness is a gift we give ourselves. Allowing ourselves to be happy is a key factor in this book, and one that inspires the thoughtful reader to turn inside and find out how to make their own happines.. I truly enjoyed this book."
5,CLASSIC JAZZ !! LOVE THIS CD~ LENNIE IS THE MAN,"MY SISTER MET LENNIE AND HIS WIFE AND SUGGESTED WE LOOK UP HIS MUSIC. I DID AN AMAZON SEARCH AND WAS VERY PLEASANTLY SURPRISED . THIS CD HAS BECOME ONE OF OUR FAVORITE LAZY AFTERNOON , DRINKING A GLASS OF WINE ON THE PATIO, CD'S . WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO ORDERING SOME OF HIS NEWER ONES."
2,YOU ARE MY ACCOMPLICE,"This is a low budget mid-1980's drive-in movie flick...about second feature good. Christine (Simone Griffeth) has a wonderful life married to businessman Clive (Bryan Marshall). They have a chauffeur, a cook, and someone to butter the kid's toast, but no one to walk the dogs. Christine takes her dogs to a park where she meets Greg (Steve Marachuk), a handsome second story man who brings chaos to her home.The sell point of this whole film is Simone Griffeth who looks like Bo Derek's sister, a look very popular look in this era. And like Bo, she is not shy. The story is fairly lame by today's standards.Sex and nudity (Simone Griffeth) No f-bombs."
3,A Lonely Woman Falls For A Loser,"A rich and beautiful woman meets a thief and begins a love affair with him, not realizing that she could be drawn into his criminal world."
5,Best musical ever.,Entertaining from start to finish. This musical will always be great. Once you see it you will be hooked. The original critics were wrong!
3,It was okay,I have seen and heard better but the ending was amazing when they had the original cast come out and sing. I liked it
5,Les Miserables,"The item was exactly as described and more than fulfilled my expectations. I would suggest to anyone to buy this, and I would tell them it can be found on Amazon."
2,"Great Musical ""Performed"" in a football stadium","This is a great piece of modern musical art and entertainment. I've gone to see it in London and have seen it at the Shubert in Century City many times. In all cases the casts were excellent and the overall effect was moving! Here comes the 25th anniversary concert on blu-ray with state of the art surround sound! What a disappointment! The concert was done in what seemed to be a football stadium, complete with screaming fans who yelled and applauded over most of the orchestral passages. Each of the ""singers"" were equiped with microphones in which each screamed for the entire evening. Not all the singers were vocally good enough to merit all that amplification. There is no balance between vocal parts and the orchestra. The performers stand in place sreaming while the orchestra can't be heard. This has been a lesson to me. You can't hear a musical production that has been produced as if it were a football game."
1,Et Tu - Disney,"I loved the show actually I love musicals. I've seen Les Miserable in London, New York and Los Angeles. The 10th anniversary came out and I love it. Soon after, I witness the worse performance done in Los Angeles (the very last performance) in the Pantages. That turned around when Ahmanson in Los Angeles revived it. Once more, travesty - Joel Schumacher does the movie version of the Phantom of the Opera. But was followed by the 25th Anniversary of the Phantom of the Opera Royal Albert Hall. Bravo. Browsing through Amazon, I saw this 25th Anniversary Edition of Les Miserable and was about to ignore all negative review, but curiosity overcame. I saw Nick Jonas as Marius. My jaw dropped. Nick Jonas' rendition of Empty Chairs at Empty Tables is empty and insulting. Les Miserable is not Disney and it would be good for Disney singers current or not to stick with their own brand of musical."
1,"Inspiring, endearing, heart warming",This production is so awesome we can't stop watching it over and over. It is one of the finest vocal performances I have ever seen.
4,Great,"GreatI have the former version DVD,I think it's very good. I 've got this blurry, it's much improve both audio/video."
3,Who's who?,"There is no ""program"" inside the case. It would have been nice to have a list of the actors/actresses performing the songs. A listing of the songs as they are preformed would have been appreciated. I always get a ""program"" when I attend a live stage venue. Too bad it wasn't included with this DVD."
4,Entertaining at Best,"I bought this DVD from Amazon. Good price. i love the performance, found it very entertaining. I do prefer the stage setting. compared to the 10th anniversary setting. The performers get there cue and get out on stage, whereas the 10th anniversary stage, the cast were all sitting there in plain view. To me this arrangement was more attractive.Now the cast was interesting, there were a lot of young performers. That was goodOn the whole they did very well. i loved them all.I do prefer the 10th anniversary cast. more mature and seasoned in vocals, and actingI liked Lea better as Eponine, not Fantine. I would recommend buy the 10th and the 25th Anniversary for you collection."
5,"EXCELLENT, AWESOME!","Its Les Miserables, how can it be anything but over the top GREAT! There was talk of Nic Jonas not being strong, but I think his innocense brings a new light to Marius, he is really good in his role. The entire DVD in Blu-ray is so very good. I recommend this to any LM fan!"
3,Cheaper Price on Amazon.co.uk (even with exchange rate),I recently purchased this on the UK Amazon site and only paid approx. $27 (after conversion from pounds). The blu-ray DVD is not region-coded and can be played on US players & tvs(unlike the regular DVD version coded only region 2 on the UK site).
4,Nick Jonas EPIC FAIL,"I love Les Mis, overall I will say that most of the performances were moving, there were several times during the program where I needed a tissue. The music always moves me to tears. Awesome performances, except for Nick Jonas, what were they thinking when they thought it would be a good idea to put this pathetic ameteur on stage with true professionals? With his weak voice and pained expression, it was pitiful to watch and just as painful to listen to. I wouldn't let it ruin my overall impression though. This is why I only gave 4 stars, ignore the meak and meager Jonas and you get 5. The encore was spine-chilling, the voices of the 4 Valjean's were stunning together, more crying from me here. Highly recommended."
5,Les Miserables 25th Anniversary Concert,The entire cast and production was absolutely breathtaking. This video provides two and a half hours of wonderful entertainment. The production had many memories because my husband and I were fortunate to see the production in London 25 years ago. This production was even more spectacular with the chorus in the background and the excellent orchastra to back up the cast of singers.
4,Wow,"I Love Les Mis since I sang it in Jr High. What a wonderful musical. I love Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean, Lea Salonga as Fantine, Samantha Barks as Eponine. Little Jonas Brother got lost standing next to anybody, and you couldn't hear him unless he was soloing. This is my favorite roll for Ramin Karimloo as Enjolras, it really shows him at his best I feel.You can't compare the 10th and 25th Anniversary Cast as they all made it there own. Growing up with the Dream Cast from the 10th I have to say I now watch and listen to the 25th Anniversary more."
3,Not as good...,"Overall, the concert was good. Alfie Boe didn't disappoint, as well as most of the artists. One thing I just can't fathom is the inclusion of Nick Jonas, who really stood out -- as the least talented! It's nice that they included a number by several Jean Valjeans!Blu-ray quality is good as expected."
4,Brilliant Javert,"Although this has excellent sound, the orchestra is muffled (the 10th Anniversary's orchestra is crystal clear in comparison) and Nick Jonas left a lot to be desired in terms of vocal power. Katie Hall's voice was also on the weak side. Aside from that, Norm Lewis as Javert was absolutely brilliant, conveying a tremendous range of emotions, just with his voice. The staging, even as a concert, was also excellent, far above that of the 1995 presentation. Not having to flip the disc in the middle of the concert is an added plus and the added bonus of the four Valjeans and comments by Mackintosh and collaborators was a welcome addition. The 10th anniversary concert is still the best recorded and this represents a welcome addition on blu-ray."
5,Wonderful Production,Excellent production. I really enjoyed the music and the singing was outstanding and the acting was great. The orchestra was unbelievable.
5,Great Opera,"I have seen this opera live, and on PBS stations. This disc is the first Blu-ray disc I have bought. Great quality, no issues with the disc. My wife and I have watched this many times. We love the music and the story. Very glad we bought this, very glad the company of players were blessed with the great voices they have. The extra walk-ons by previous voices was a real treat. This is a very moving story that you must enjoy for yourself, you owe yourself this treat."
4,The long-awaited dvd is here!,"I love Les Misrables. I loved the 10th Anniversary Edition. There's only really one thing I'd like to add to the other reviews. We felt that the videography, lighting, and filming quality was inferior to the 10th Anniversary show. The videographers spent too much time on distace scenes where we, like the audience, watched the close-ups on the screens above the actual performers. Kind of bummer."
2,kind of boring.....,I tried to see the opera just to compare with the new movie(Hugh Jackman) but it 's no comparison. It's best to see the moviewith the scene and backdrop to appreciate Les Mis. Besides the DVD stopped and froze in the middle so I have to switch it off.
5,Wonderful Performances,"I bought this the other day and have watched it twice already, with the intention of watching it again this week! I love musical theatre, but for whatever reasons, I have always missed this when it came to my town (it's coming again this spring and I am definitely going!!). I know there are a lot of Les Mis experts out there, but in my own humble opinion, the performances, the songs, the whole experience was what made me buy it after actually renting it. I needed to see it again. I was in tears at the end. Beautiful rendition, and I do have to admit that I laughed myself when I heard Nick Jonas was cast, but I (and this, again, is just me), thought he did a fine job. I liked him a lot in this, along with favorites Ramin Karimloo and Lea Salonga. If you are a Les Mis fan, this is a definite must have."
4,Not Quite as Good as the 10th Anniversary,"There is no way for me to review the 25th anniversary concert without comparing it to the 10th. While the overall production, video, and sound is spectacular, the vocals are just a bit less impressive. Though all the singers do a fine job, with the exception of Nick Jonas, who is just not up to calliber with the rest of the performers, they just can't compare to Colm Wilkinson, Phillip Quast, Lea Salonga, etc. The one vocal that I did think was an improvment was Katie Hall as Cosette. One thing I did like about the 25th anniversary over the 10th was the inclusion of more of the smaller scenes, like when Marius and Cosette meet on the streets of Paris, and when Marius sends Eponine with the letter. Overall any Les Miserables fan would enjoy this show."
5,Les Miserables-25th Anniversary DVD,"I loved the 10th anniversary concert but the 25th - particularly in its BluRay version - is absolutely wonderful. Some of the reviews I've read have expressed disappointment in Nick Jonas' performance and I must concur - not the strongest, but at least adequate. This is a very small criticism, however. Overall this is a very beautiful and spectacular production. The joint performances with prior cast members during the encore are worth the cost of the DVD alone."
3,Poor quality video on regular DVD,I saw this on PBS in HD and should have put out the extra $ for the Blu-Ray version. So if you are thinking of purchasing this and have a blu-ray player get it in blu-ray.
5,quick service,Very quick service....one of the most enjoyable of all musicals....also at the same time received the 10th anniversary copy of Les Mis.....Thank you for prompt service.....
5,Concert version - Le Miserables DVD purchase,"Found the item, placed the order, received the product in a reasonable amount of time. All is good. I'm happy."
5,"""Les Mis"" - Excellent","I watched Les Miserables on our PBS stations many times and when they came out with the 25th anniversary I just had to buy it. Amazon's price was excellent and so is Les Mis""."
5,FAB-U-LOUS!!!!,"i love, love, love this dvd!!! i saw it recently on public tv and was thrilled to find it on amazon. i am a huge fan of les miz and saw the traveling production 3times when it came to my city. the voices in this rendition are all outstanding...with the notable exception of nick jonas, who just seems out of place and too weak to be in the company of the other much stronger voices and more experienced actors. i can't imagine how this casting decision got made!! another great feature of this dvd comes at the end, when the former jean valjeans come onstage and sing together...thrilling! everybody connected to this production shows such obvious love and joy for it...and that is quite contagious. i look forward to many future viewings."
4,"Great Filming, Performance was very good",Overall I liked the recording. The performances are really good. I fell in the trap of trying to compare to some of the original Les Miserables recordings. I remember that I like the Gary Morris recording over Colm Wilkinson.Initially I though that Nick Jonas performance was so so. I do not think it was as charismatic as some of the other parts.I certainly like the other earlier recordings such as the Complete Symphonic recording better. There were some places where itseemed that Nick Jonas Struggled a bit. I some of the performance had a little more character or expression. I think Nick Jonas needs to develop the Vocal Range of his voice a little.There was a place where he really struggled going for some of the lower notes.
5,I love this musical.,"A friend made me watch the 25th anniversary edition in College. I thought I was going to want to die, seeing as Nick Jonas played Marius. But it was awesome!"
5,A great evening of entertainment,More complete than the 10 year although some of the voices not as strong. Brings back memories of when I saw this in London 22 years ago.
3,This was a gift,Out family has always enjoyed the music and story of this video. This was a gift to an artist friend.
2,Review,It didn't play the whole way through. It got about half way then it began to skip scenes. Might want to double check your disc before playing.
3,Ah - that explains it,"As I was watching this I was really disappointed with Marius. Not just the singing, but the lack of affect in performance. The actor/singer doesn't respond to the others in any way.Then I read the other reviews that it was Nick Jonas. Clearly the producers went with flashy casting instead getting a solid anchor.Bummer. I wish I could insert a younger Michael Ball in the role. He was outstanding in the 10th anniversary version.However, this Cosette is miles better than the 10th anniversary one.In general, this cast is more age-appropriate than the 10th anniversary, though I think the vocal talent was generally better in the 10th.So, 3 stars. Good, but not great."
5,Great voices,"Have seen Les Mis in NY and Boston and the voices here are the best. If new to Les Mis, see the movie first as story line is a bit harder to follow.in the DVD."
5,Very well conducted!!,"I bought this for my family, and my parents and my in-laws loved it! Difficult to pick any one person as the best!!!"
2,"Show is fantastic, video quality is lacking.","I almost bought the blu-ray version of this, but settled for lower resolution. Oops. Detail is not good in the dvd version."
5,Outstanding Performance,"The music is wonderful. It is worth every cent I paid for it. The London Production is great. ""Les Miserables"" and the London Production of ""The Phantom of the Opera, 25th aniversary"" are great to watch."
3,Poor quality,This is a Blue Ray disc and the quality of the video portionof the recording left me very disappointed....It was fuzzythroughout the entire production.....
2,Disappointing.,"Get the 10th Anniversary Edition. Nick Jonas is really miscast. The audio mix on ""One Day More"" is inexcusably bad. Remember, it's about the music and the story, not the lighting and effects. Alfie Boe is does great as Jean Valjean."
2,Les Miserables... with Nick Jonas?????,"It should have been an amazing show.Everything was going exceptionally well and everyone was giving amazing performances.Untill..... Nick Jonas arrives at the stage.Who in their right mind casts Nick Jonas for such a show? This was a DISGRACE.I even felt sorry for the guy, trying to sing along with his amazing talented colleagues.I was so disapointed with his performance I did not even had the stomach to finish the Blu-Ray.I can't give more than a 2 Star rating because of this and I am sorry to say I will never recommend this to anyone.Buy the 10 Year aniversary DVD instead. That one is worth it.Don't buy this one. I'm sorry I did."
3,not the 10 th,"To me - combine both the 10 th and this 25 th ... Ms Salonga is tops of em all , given the show is really about Javert & Valjeanand of course nothings gonna top the 10 th but this is a fine variant for the intense fan"
5,"Dude, Nick Jonas did great- stop whining, people!","C'mon, give Nick some slack.This is a great performance all around- really, you definitely should buy it! But what I want to address is all of the reviewers casting aspersions on Nick's performance as Marius. Watching it for the first time, I had no idea who played the part of Marius. I was so impressed with his voice and acting that I looked up the show on imdb.com and, to my amazement- whoah! it's Nick Jonas! In the past I have INTENSELY disliked the Jonas brothers, simply based on the fact that they are Disney pop sensations, and we all know what usually happens to Disney pop sensations. Nick's performance as Marius, however, has caused me to take a second look at him. He has actually undertaken a serious acting/singing role, and done it well!Perhaps there is more to this brother than meets the eye..."
2,One Good Reason Not To Buy This NICK JONAS as MARIUS!!!,"NICK JONAS AS MARIUS. What were they thinking in giving a role like Marius to Nick Jonas.... R U Kidding me... Seriously. Nick Jonas is standing next Ramin Karimloo and you can tell what a high school amateur he is. I really wanted to buy this but rented it on Amazon first to check it out and Nick RUINED this production. He's constantly looking off to the side as if he's reading the words off of a tele-prompter.I don't get it???Also Alfie Boe is a great singer, but the guy needs to take a lesson from Colm Wilkinson and learn when to use a little dynamics and not always sing the big stuff as BIG and as operetic as he does.IMO the 10th anniversary is far and above a much better show when it comes to the quality of singers. The one singer that really stands out is Samantha Barks as Eponine. Fantastic. If your a HUGE fan, than get it.. I still might... But I still can't get over Nick Jonas... UGH."
4,Great for fans,"Les Miserables is my favorite musical ever. I was so glad that they released the 25th Anniversary Concert in Blu-ray. It definitely makes a difference in crisp color and clarity. I was in tears within the first five minutes from Jean Valjean's impassioned singing. The only cast choice that was poor in my opinion was Nick Jonas. For me, Nick Jonas was not up to par in tone, passion, and overall skill to play Marius. But perhaps this was a choice to encourage young (or very young) viewers. Katie Barks did very well as Cosette, but Samantha Barks for me, was not inspiring Eponine. One thing to note, this version is focused on the singing, so there is very little acting with most actors standing in front of microphones for most of the show.All in all, I would recommend this DVD--the Blu-ray version is definitely worth it and a special treat is seeing some of the older cast members!"
5,Les Miserables 25th Anniversary Concert,"This is by far the Best Performance's I have ever seen even surpassing the 10th Anniversary, the video is crisp, clear and outstanding sounds one could ever want in a DVD of this incredable show, the cast and music are absolutely the best next to seeing it live, and is well worth it."
5,Never gets old to watch,fantastic! It's almost like watching it in person... The navigation is especially awesome. I could listen to this over and over!
5,Love les Mis!,I have nothing but great experiences with my purchases through Amazon. This DVD came quickly and the price was great!We love this performance and will enjoy it for many years to come.Laura Bradley
4,les miserables 25th anniversary dvd,"very nice and new stage design, excellent visual and audio recordings. lea is still wonderful. however nick jonas is a disappointment. his voice is a mismatch and a distraction. the reunion with the 10th anniversary dreamcast at the end is fabulous, just to see how the cast has aged but still keep the edge."
5,A feast for the eyes and ears!,"This DVD is a must for theatre and music lovers. It is a virtual feast for the eyes and ears. If you love Les Miz' , you'll love this."
5,Les Miserables - Incredible,I was only able to catch part of the 25th anninversary presentation on PBS. with what I saw I knew I needed to purchase the blue-ray version that was available on amazon.com. it is truly the greatest musical of all time. the voices of almost the entire cast were incredible. the weakest was the Jonas brother. my wife and I have already watched it three times since we received it. we are also anxiously waiting for the 10th anniversary version to come out on blue-ray. the cast of that version was also incredible.
4,Great!,I loved this video. It was very well put together and I wish that I had been there for the actual event. This made me feel like I had the best seat in the house and I could't stop thinking about it for weeks after I watched it.
4,"Alfie Boe is spectacular; BUT, overall, 10th anniversary performances are superior to these","Granted, there are several stunning moments by this cast, most notably when Alfie Boe brings down the house with his version of ""Bring Him Home"" and again when Boe,Colm Wilkinson and two current Jean ValJeans sing that song together.But the main fly in the ointment was the miscasting of pop singer Nick Jonas as Marius...a gaffe made all the more obvious when Michael Ball, a stellar Marius in the show's earlier days (including the 10th anniversary), made an appearance during the delightful encore and reminded everyone what Marius' voice SHOULD sound like."
1,where is it?,I have been waiting over a month for my DVD and have not received it yet. I know the cost has already been taken from my credit card but I have been patiently waiting for my purchase.....where is it???Kathleen Najera
1,It didn't work!,"I bought it thru Amazon and when I tried to play it wouldn't work so I sent it back for a full refund, no problem."
5,CANNOT BE MISSED!!,"Whether or not you've seen the show or read the book, this is magical and complete!! In this case the 'songs' tell the whole story, the performances are magnificent, and the appearance of the 'originals' is a treat. I saw ""Les Mis"" in London during the second season, and thought I'd miss the sets (I didn't). I did miss the 'scope' (no TV can match a stage), but otherwise, I was entirely 'hooked'."
5,Best Jean Valjean,"This is my favorite production of Les Mis. While Nick Jonas kinda stinks it up, all the other singers more than make up for it, especially Jean Valjean!"
5,So great!,"I saw Les Mis on Broadway in 1998, and this is about as close to that experience as you can get on DVD. It really is an excellent performance!"
5,Les Miserables 25th Concert,"This was an outstanding performance! The first time I saw it was only by chance and I had expected to walk away. Instead I ended up buying it - not once , but twice! After the performance ends come encores which are also a treat. For any Les Mis fans this is truly a treat,"
5,Best Les Mis yet!!,Best cast yet!! Wonderful!!! I've watched it over and over and it just gets better each time! I think I'll watch it again.
2,Disappointing,"By now, fans know every line of the score. Cutting sections leaves awkward gaps where the listener anticipates words that never come.Casting was also less than optimal. Visually, Norm Lewis has the sternness and the drive for the role of Javert, but his voice lacks the emotional range that made Philip Quast's performance so memorable. Nick Jonas seems to be winking at the camera in every frame. Alfie Boe brings youth and vitality to his role... but Valjean is better known for his resignation and weariness.The physical placement of the actors on the stage did little to enhance my appreciation of this version. I had a hard time seeing the intimacy between the characters when they were standing half a stage apart using separate microphones."
4,get this edition,Other than the Jonas brother attempting to stretch his talent this edition is well worth having in your collection. Gave several as gifts with approving reception.
5,Great DVD,"What a wonderful show. Wish I could get ou & see it live at the theater, when it comes here."
3,Les Miserables,"The 25th celebration of Les Miserables is amazing! but, attention, this is just a concert e not the play. Very differente from the 25th Celebration of The Phanton of the Opera that is the full's play. But, Les Miserable's concert is wonderful.Les Miserables: The 25th Anniversary Concert [Blu-ray]"
4,Les Miserables: 25th Anniversary,"I have to admit that I was skeptical of the new cast, being a great fan of the 10th anniversary cast, but after watching it the first time I came to love it almost as much. The Jonas Brother tends to get a lot of flack for not being at quite the same level as the rest of the cast, but I think he did a good job. The Innkeeper is hilarious, though I still like the old one as well. I think the emotions in this one are portrayed a little better. I do miss Colm Wilkinson though and am glad they all come back to sing at the end. All in all, very good. I can't quite give it a 5 though... maybe because I love the 10th anniversary one so very much."
4,"Really enjoying it, except for Jonas Brother","I've listened to it several times (while working) and I am really enjoying it. Especially, hearing parts I never heard before because the only live performance I've seen was at a High school years ago. I haven't watched my VHS of the 10th anniversary in ages so I can't compare.These characters left the biggest impression on meJavert - loved him. Wonderful voiceGavroche - adorable - his cheekyness was perfect.Marius - UGH. Ok, not ugh. The Jonas Brother simply doesn't have the vocal strength for this. I've thought many times, ""why couldn't they have let one of actors who have a smaller part play Marius and stunt cast a smaller part."" His voice is Ok I guess, but it is ordinary and the rest of the cast was extraordinary."
2,Les Miserables 25th Anniversary Concert,"The performaces, for the mostpart, were on the money. The audio mix and quality were a dissapointment. I was hoping for an improvement from the 10th anniversary concert and got something less."
4,This was an interesting DVD.,It was a very interesting DVD. The Royal Albert Hall is incredible and the fact that it was an Anniversary Edition made it more interesting. I was surprised that the Singers just stood there in front of microphones rather than actually acting out the parts. The movie which is up for an Oscar was much more realistic and I loved the movie! The Music is lovely!
5,Love this DVD,"I read there has been a lot of criticism re: the decision to cast Nick Jonas in the role of Marius for this concert. I did not find it a distraction. He does a credible job, not a great actor for certain, but he has a good singing voice. He was in the company of some very accomplished West End and internationally well known people and was bound to suffer by comparison. The DVD is a wonderful collection of orchestration and singing from Alfie Boe, Lea Solanga, Samantha Barks, Ramin Karimloo, Norm Lewis, Colm Wilkinson, Michael Ball, Rebecca Caine, Frances Ruffelle and the casts from the two companies of Les Miz, playing in London at the time. They perform selections from the musical play, in a format that tells the story of this Victor Hugo novel. Good recording and well edited,. This DVD is a keeper with two plus hours of very listenable music."
5,Great concert!,"I love this Les Miserable concert. Alfie Boe did a wonderful job in playing the role of Jean Valjean. Lea Salonga also did a great job of playing Fantine this time. In the previous Les Miserables play and concert, she did the role of Eponine and it was also excellent. What I didn't like in this concert is Nick Jonas playing as Marius. I don't think it was suitable for him. He doesn't really have a good vocal range. For me, he did an OK job. Overall, the concert was still great!"
3,Not as good as the 10th anniversary,"We just saw this on public TV. While it was a very nice job, I do not think it rates as high as the 10th anniversary production. The lead female singer is excellent, but I did not think the lead male carried quite as much impact as the 10th anniversary. In addition, the finale was a bit disappointing. For those who have seen the 10th, you know it ends by having lead male singers from many countries - Germany, Japan, Spain, etc. sing in their native language! It was awesome. The 25th ending had the top leads from the early days and current productions, but nothing like the 10th year. In addition, I had a hard time understanding the young female lead - she was too near the mike and the young male had too much of an English accent for an American audience.I liked it, but not enough to give it more than a 3."
1,Still have not received it yet,"May I get more information on when I can expect this particular item? It was supposed to be a Christmas gift, but still have not received"
1,Disappointed,"I play the music on spotify and also from TV recording, was expecting the DVD of Broadway stage show, very disappointed."
3,Bought the DVD for Someone Else,"I wasn't impressed by the book, even though it's a classic, so I didn't watch it; I just bought it for someone who's a big fan of it."
1,Bad video quality and it skips back,"The concert is good but not the video resolution and it skips back and it cycles back at a certain part of the videoo - it never ends.I don't recommend buying this dvd.I am very disappointed, a waste of money."
5,Best way to listen,"This blu-ray is great. Some of the best performers get together for an ""at mic"" performance of the Les Miserables music with costumes and a little dramatic staging that just sets the mood"
5,Nick was on broadway before he was a Disney star...,"I'm not a fan of Nick Jonas what so ever, but I do know that he was actually on Broadway before he was a Disney star. In fact he at one point played Gavroche on Broadway. I was able to ignore his poor performance though because I was so taken back by talent of Norm Lewis (Javert), Lea Salonga (Fantine), Samantha Barks (Eponine) and my personal favorite Ramin Karimloo (Enjolras). Ramin has previously played, The Phantom of the Opera, Raoul (from POTO), Marius (Les Mis) and is currently playing Jean Val Jean at the West End. His voice is like nothing I have ever heard before! Definitely a great cast."
1,Nick Jonas single handedly destroyed this show performance!,Why was he cast in the first place?? He isn't even close in vocal talent as the rest of the cast. He had short breathy phrases and had the same pained look on his face throughout. I was actually embarassed for him. I am not sure I am going to buy this dvd because I couldn't bear the thought of having to watch Nick again!! I think I'll get out my 10th anniversary concert instead!
2,Bad writing,"I know this review will probably be unpopular, but right from the beginning this play smacks of bad writing. There's just way too much expository and not enough action. The characters explain too much. It would have been much better to show us what happens rather than having a character explain how he/she got to where they're at."
1,Disappointed!,"The video editing and sound quality of this product is very disappointing, especially considering the expense that went into creating and assembling this talented cast. Originally, I was so thrilled to receive the 25th Anniversary edition and then after watching it I was blown away with how poorly the editing was done. It's too bad since the star studded cast had to have sounded incredible that night! Previously, I had watched it on youtube in segments and decided to invest in a copy. I feel like the YouTube segments were superior for sound quality than the real thing. Disappointing since there was such a talented ensemble."
2,Poor performance,"I tought it would be a great show, but to my surprise, I found out that the performance was rather poor in comparison to the previous live presentation (The dream cast in concert) in 1998."
5,"Les Miserables 25th anniversary,in concert by Roger Allam","This is an unforgetable concert. The talent is amazing. Nick Jonas was a little weak, but I think as he matures and has a bit more broadway experience he will be much better. At the end of the concert, the original 1985 cast, joins the company on stage and sings some of the better known and loved songs.A quartet combining Alfie Boe, Colom Wilkinson,Simon Bowman and John Owen-Jones, the best known men to portray Jean Valjean,sing 'Bring Him Home', and is actually my favorite part. Even after 25 years, Colom Wilkinson can bring tears to your eyes. They are all so, so good. You can see it on UTube, 'Valjean Quartet'. Don't eventhink. If you like Les Mis, buy this DVD."
5,A DVD to keep,"As popular as the airing on Public Television is year, this DVD is sure to give one many hours of enjoyment for years to come. It is a masterful performance."
1,Terrible performance,"I am watching the DVD now and I don't think I can finish it. It is just terrible. All the singers were just screaming rather than singing. There is absolutely no musicality in their voices. Lea Salonga's voice has a wobble so big you can drive a truck through it. Please save your money and your time, don't watch it. I will turn off the DVD player as soon as I finish typing this review."
1,Dissapointed but expected,"Les Miserables is one of the, if not, the greatest musicals of all time. However this ensemble of a cast was disappointing. Marketing was at play to gain a new audience. They did the same with Phantom of the Opera movie. Why in the world would they cast Nick Jonas? How do you go from Michael Balll to a Jonas Brother? His accent was more ""English"" than the British. I think little Gavourche would have put on a better Marius. This Valjean is no Colm Wilkinson. Wilksonson was the most convincing of Valjeans because you could feel a man and his struggles when he sings. This Javert commands no authority and Thenardier was difficult to watch. This cast is a dismal comparison to the Original London Cast, but this was also expected.I do recommend that Les Mis fans rent this copy because of the nice little treats at the end of the DVD."
