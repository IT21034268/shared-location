3,"Casino Un-Royale ""Delux"" version",I had owned an older version.The movie is not full length. How is this version any better?It is 7 minutes SHORTER than the older version which had incomplete scenes? Duh!I loved the original version. It is a funny spoof on James Bond! I grew up with these very funny actors! Anyone not realizing who all the actors are may not appreciate this movie. This Movie is done in British and Period style-humor.Without the complete scenes this movie is not as effective!
2,"This is a good, funny movie for those hard-core 007 fans.","The producer of ""Casino Royale"" got the rights to the James Bond novel, and not wanting to compete with the official series, made this 007 spoof. Sir James Bond is in retirement, and the storyline follows his return to espionage and to battle his enemy--his nephew--Jimmy Bond."
1,5 unfinished good movies equals one bad finished movie,"You can tell that five directors and a host of writers attempted this mis-mash of almost unrelated scenes, and the directorial and acting styles are vastly different in each. In fact, it looks like several really good movies were trying to be made, but none of them is finished; instead, each one was abandoned and all were spliced together into an incoherent LSD trip, and the result is a tiresome waste of money and talent."
2,Corky Film,"I prefer a more serious Casino Royale. I have read the novel and it was good. As for this film, you have to have a serious sense of humor to understand this film. I own it on VHS, and I only watch it when I need help in falling asleep."
2,Far from being as funny as they say...,"I agree with the review that called this movie ""AUSTIN POWERS without the laughs"". About half way through the movie it becomes so absurd that it is not funny.To make things worse this movie is upheld as the funniest spoof on James Bond. So the expectations are set way above of this movie potential. Be warned if you go for this movie - you are going to shake your had more than laugh...."
5,Excellent '60s Magic; Acid Soaked Bond Spoof,"As a '60s afficionado I finally got around to seeing this great psychedelic mindblower of a film. It starts off slow....enter Ursula Andress. There are at least 100 beautiful European girls in this film and I can see Woody Allen's motivation to kill all men taller than him so he can get them all. As the film takes off you realize that you have to be on Acid to understand the plot, as everyone remotely connected with this film must've been. The sets range from a Scottish castle to a Berlin haunted house to Orson Wells' psychedelic torture chamber complete with mod spiral funhouse rooms, and it gets more bizarre from there. Great music by Burt Bacharach (The Look of Love).Has cameos from practically every British star of the time, has a Spaceship full of Woody's duplicate World Leaders...it has everything. What can I say, if you like the '60s you'll love this if you possess that '60s Psychodelic Consciousness that is."
4,Don't be so serious Bond is fictional,"I decided to leave this after reading a few reviews of this SPOOF of Bond. People are actually upset that someone dared to make fun of James Bond. Give me a break how seriously can we take it after Timothy Dalton played 007 ?The history given in one review does lead you to believe some of this movie was playing ""catch-up"" and no it's not hilarious but definitely funny and as someone who has seen every commercially successful Bond including R.Moore, S.Connery , T. Dalton, P. Brosnan and G. Lazenby this is funny. You can definitely see ""Austin Powers"" in it as well as a few other movies, but one must keep in mind this is british humor so you won't be slapping your knee or falling off the sofa.Frankly, I have more of an issue with Daniel Craig playing the early Bond instead of some younger Brit, but he was excellent in ""Layer Cake"" so I guess we'll give him a chance although not thrilled with Eva Green as Vespa Lynd, she's no Ursula Andress."
5,Casino Royale VHS,"Casino Royale was well received with tears.At the time of viewing, it view was excellentIt arrived in time for Christmas. It was agift for another person. That person justlove that movie. I am sure will watch itmany times. I would certainly purchase fromthis seller again."
2,Silliness can be taken too far.,"Great cast, cinematography, and great location shots in Scotland and England, but really - the movie is just TOO silly. There is very little artful comedy here. I think a lot of rich movie people got together to make this on a lark, to celebrate themselves, and to enjoy a six week long party.Don't waste your time, unless you're REALLY bored and have absolutely nothing else to do."
5,The best movie of the late 60s,"I consider this the best movie of the late 60s just as I consider The Prisoner as the best television program and White Rabbit as the best song. This movie is a psychedelic satire of the James Bond movies. Everyone involved in the production, directing, acting and film scoring were the first rank talent of that era. The story is intentionally disjointed and strange in order to produce a confusing effect in the viewer. The only thing this has in common with the book is the title and the James Bond character. It is a total rewrite. The bonus feature of the TV version of Casino Royale is also included."
3,OK,"Surprisingly good. I thought it would be boring, but although in some stretches it was slow, the comedy is pretty good. Did I mention that Woody Allen is awesome!"
3,weird woody strikes again,"good movie, very weird jokes, great acting, David Diven, Woody Allen, Peter Sellers, buy it."
4,Not bad...,"It's not the best in the series, but it's a nice entertaining one. It could be the last one though if they were to end it."
5,LOVELY,"That's one of the best movie ever. The Music is so Fantastic. The Story is great. All the girls are beautifull. The actors are great. The decors are so cool. And the five last minutes are So Great....... Austin Powers is kind of a Casino Royale Remake.... But Casino Royale is far more better. Please release it in DVD !!! But Who is le Chifre ? -Nobody Knows, not even Le Chiffre.Ahead Shuttle (Ahead@caramail.com)"
3,A rare spoof on James Bond,"A stellar cast, and a good takeoff on the James Bond series. This is a comic farce - one that's worth seeing at least once."
2,Be warned: everything in the review above is true except for one thing...,"The movie is not funny. The movie is way, way, way out there, and if you enjoy that sort of thing you will be highly entertained."
1,Absolutely LAME,"This isn't just bad; it's atrocious. Shocked to the core, I was. The moment I watched this I was stunned. It did not follow Ian Fleming (it wasn't supposed to) and it wasn't funny. It leaves me wondering why on earth I'd wasted so much time even buying it.It is the most un-Bond, unfunny movie I've watched, ever. Highly recommend you NOT to waste your money on someone who is not cool and is given a title that Ian Fleming serious despised, especially for his beloved character - 'Sir'."
2,"""Casino Royal"" not ""Austin Powers""","This movie is horrible....first off....even with a HDTV and Surround Sound, I still could not hear the dialouge....damn English accents are just too thick for me to enjoy....Mike Myers was most definetly stoned when he saw this and thought it was a good enough film to base ""Austin Powers"" on.....Austin Rocks....Casino is a flop!!.....stay away....if interested....rent but do not purchase this garbage!!"
3,"Brand New Heavies, The - Apparently Nothing","On this second disc of APPARENTLY NOTHING remixes, Johnny Douglas gets to pull out all the stops for his R&B mix, cutting the beats in and out like a pro. Roger Sanchez puts a smooth house rub on the track (if you've heard his other mix, you know what to expect), while the Dope Smugglaz do stuttering hip-hop. Competent, but not mind-blowing."
5,A decent sampling of The Drifters' hits,"Remember the Drifters? If you are of my generation, you'll most likely recall some of their hits, probably most notably ""Under the Boardwalk."" That familiar and lively song is reproduced here. So, too, are other of their well known songs, such as ""Up on the Roof.""Interesting, too, is the composers of many of their songs. Leiber and Stoller are credited (along with others) for ""Rat Race"" and ""On Broadway."" Goffin and King provide ""Up on the Roof"" and ""At the Club.""From one song to the next, this is a boatload of fun."
1,"Volume 1- Very Disappointing, To Say the Least","What dumb idiot decided to release Volume 1 with random episodes on it. This is not the full season, but FOUR episodes TOTAL. No clue, but don't waste your time with this one if your after most of the season 1 episodes, I didnt know better and ordered this, now I regret it. Get the others instead!In any saving grace here, the real gem of this disc is the outtakes and bloopers that were extras' here, as there are a TON of them. Thats about it. Oh.. yea and this set musthave been an after thought to those producing this dvd, because auto start for the disc makes you sit through all of its cartoon/movie promos (like 5 or 6 of them) before ever getting to the root menu. Fortunately you can force your way through most of them. Very annoying and irritating.. so skip this disc if you can help it. The episodes for this disc are: numbers 214/217/222/228"
5,i love this show!,"when i bought the amanda show i got it in a box set containing the 1 and 2 volumes! the best sketches are stranded,cookie dooper,the girls room. but the greatest of all time sketces areblocklister,moodys point and my fave the reaturant and wedding singers melody and thad the songs thay sang crack me up! whens the 3 volume coming out? i need another one!!!!!"
4,Amanda Bynes sketch Moody's Point compared to?,"I seen Amanda Bynes sketch from Moody's Point, it was amazing. The show is compared to Dawson's Creek and The O.C. Amanda Bynes character Moody is compared to Dawson's Creek Joey Potter and The O.C.'s Marisa Cooper. Amanda Bynes is compared to Dawson's Creek' Katie Holmes, 7th Heaven Jessica Biel and The O.C.'s Rachel Bilson. Amanda Bynes was in a teen drama, I think she would have played The O.C.'s Marisa Cooper or Summerland's Erika Spalding."
5,Excellent Reading,"Enjoyed reading this book more than any read in ages. It is equal to the previous book --""OUTBACK"". Follows the same trend with occasional visits by the characters of the first book. I read it through fairly fast to get the story thenre-read slowly to absorb the history and description of the locale. I would reccomend it to anyone that enjoys history in fiction form."
4,Book #2 in the Outback Saga,"Although this book is second in Fletcher'sOutbackSaga, this one actually backtracks in time and retells some of the same history from the POV of David Kerrick. David murdered his wife's lover in a jealous rage and has been deported to Australia. Industrious, David earns his freedom and the lure of the Outback beckons him. Alexandra Hammond is a cousin of the man David murdered and circumstances which I cannot divulge without spoiling brings her to the Outback and the two marry and raise sheep. The latter part is that of the second generation with the growth of Sydney and the discovery of gold.Unfortunately telling more than that is very much on the spoiler side of things. While it does sound dull on the surface, there is a lot of interesting stuff going on, but the biggest thrill for me was seeing some old friends from the first book - the Garritty's and most especially that ball of fire Sheila.The next three in the series are Walk About, Wallaby Track and Outback Legacy."
2,Prettier in the Picture,"I was looking for something to protect my dress clothes while putting on makeup. Although the sizing was fine and the construction seemed adequate, the fabric was a faded print and different base colors than the picture. The print looked cheap and I was very disappointed. Sent it back for a refund. Amazon made it easy.."
4,Purchase,"This review is for the Metered Water Softener with High Flow 1"" Autotrol 268/762 Logix Control, 48,000 Grain Capacity & By-Pass Valve. Today was (Purchase Day) and after googling several reviews and information on a water softener, I decided to purchase this one. So, once I get it home, sometime next month, I will update this review for s/h and installation. Thanks for reading 27NOV10... Ace!"
5,John Carter,New movie coming out about John Carter of Mars. These are the Mars books written by Edgar Rice Burroughs. This is a series. Great for young people. This was just one of the books in the series that are so hard to find.
4,Not much basics...,"I found this book in a brick and mortar store and thought it would be helpful as an introduction to weaving. While the illustrations are beautiful and the coverage appears to be broad, I disliked the organization of the book. It is not well organized for a beginner. It would have made learning easier to introduce the technical terms more slowly and then providing an illustrated glossary at the back. I found that the book went into too much technical detail too quickly. Teach a person to weave with a lap loom and those terms first until comfort with the vocabulary is established. Instead the author launches into a detailed explanation of floor looms, etc., in the second chapter! I believe this book is a good resource and I may turn to it later on, but this books is not for beginners."
5,Magic of Handweaving,"As a very new weaver without much confidence in what I am doing, I found Sigrid Piroch's book Magic of Handweaving to be a Godsend!It tells in wonderful detail and fantastic pictures exactly what I need to know to begin weaving.I would recommend this book to any new weaver."
4,Excellent survey lacking an index,"The Magic of Handweaving: The Basics and Beyond by Sigrid Piroch offers an excellent survey of worldwide weaving methods and aims, but it has NO INDEX to the material contained in it."
2,Expensive but not better in terms of smell and taste,"My dog does not like it. It is twice as expensive as those at Costco, but smells the same. My dog took a sniff and then turned away."
4,Still strong,"The album is the first camp kill yourself i bought, it's very strong, just not quite as raw and powerful as vol. 1. The album is ten tracks long, and is a great place to get intrested in cky. Stand out tracks include1.Escape from hellview2.flesh into gear3.inhuman creation station"
5,Flawless,"I was a fan of CKY before i bought this album, so I knew that I was going to like it. But i had no idea I would put it in my CD player and keep it there for over 6 months. No other album could keep my interest for that long. This album cannot be placed under any catagory of music except just Rock. It had so much diversity. Sporadic Movement seems more metal, while Plastic Plan is an ironic, Poppy song. Unlike a normal 4 piece band, CKY uses alot of synthesisers and has no solos on the album. But what they lack in solos they make up double in pure talent in guitar. Not one song is a simple 1-4-5 progression. Overall this is the best album i have ever owned."
3,Not amazing what so ever,"This cd is worth buying, but it is not as ""Amazing"" as the die hard fans say."
3,original but mind numbingly simple and flat,"give props for cky there music isnt quite as dumb as there stupid home videos, but its far too basic and ""forced catchiness"" that its hard to be consistently entertained by its pleasures. Cky Manage to come with a decent batch of fresh guitar riffs and vocal harmonies that go along a punkish slow-burn stoner metal beat. which shine through in songs like ""escape from hellview"" ""plastic plan"" ""sporadic movement"" and ""close yet far"". but its so repetitive and flat in rythym it never kicks up a head of steam and the vocals are way too filtered and echoey. theres no bridges to speak of, and the drum fill here and there adds little but for a band intent in reinventing the mainstream this seem scaringly close to it wether you admit it or not, give it though its far easier to digest. At 34 minutes long no one should be writing a two page long review on this friggin cd....thats being over elaborative"
3,A little too over rated...,"I don't see what all the who-ha is about this record. Interesting guitar licks but nothing special. However, i do enjoy the fact that everything is evened out sound wise. Nothing is over powering eachother, everything is well put together. But, on the other hand, the voice synths do get annoying after a while. I have gone to a cky show in philly and it was better than the cd because they didnt do anything synthy with the voice. I don't think this is a very talented gruop of musicians. meh, meh , meh... not worth picking up. if you are a fan of volume 1, just pretend that IDR never happened. But all together a pretty good album. I still say Volume 1 is better."
2,"Holy crap, its not that great.","One of the reviewers said they are going to make other bands disappear... wrong. CKY is not that great. They are the equivalent of the bands you are saying they are so much greater than. I hate limp bizkit, but i would rather listen to them then CKY. At least they try different things on the cd. CKY songs all have the same boring formula. Seems like a slightly altered guitar riff with different lyrics. The only thing i like about them is the sound of the guitars, their pretty tight. Sorry guys, but CKY is no musical revolution."
2,Cky,"Album is pretty good, alot of the songs sound the same though. I'm sure all their hardcore fans will love it, others might or might not. I find their previous songs having more enthusiasm and harder riffs. They are doing pretty good for themselves and hope to see more albums come out from them."
5,Does not meet general expectations,"it excells past them. i thought that this cd would be really heavy, but that was not the case. these guys are really melodic. i highly recommend this album."
4,Its Different,"With CKYs newest cd we see a change from therefirst album(volume 1). While volume 1 had a garage band sound to it and was much harsher, this cd shows an improvement in lyrics and it seems a much cleaner production. There music is always influential and with this album seems more thought out. Great album but seems alot poppier in terms of cleaner sounding production and that for me bought down the score in terms of it doesnt sound as real. It feels like they chose to clean up there sound and change from garage to professianal."
5,Such an original album by these cky...,"The reason i like cky so much its simply because their music is very much original and it has all the elements and substance that i always look and search for in every disc that i pruchase. I truly think that cky's latest disc infiltrate-destroy-rebuild is the only non-screamo disc i have ever bought it and im proud i got it and will always be happy its in my collection... With great songs like ""flesh into gear"" , ""sink into the ground"" , ""frenetic amnesic"" , and , ""close yet far"" cky proves to me that sounding soothing yet heavy can also be a wonderfull thing. Well, if you dont own disc i.d.r. you need to stop being lazy and get to your local cd store and buy it ! Laters!!"
2,Not that great,"Why are all these reviews so good? i got this cd as a gift from a friend (a skater) and gave it a listen. It has a few catchy guitar riffs and thats about it. The singer has talent, but all of the band put together just doesn't sound that great. They abuse affects and all of the songs sound really similar to me. If i were someone i'd spend my money on real talent bands like Tool and the Red Hot Chili Peppers"
4,A wonderful album,"From start to finish, I am a huge CKY fan and always have been. Oh sure, i got volume 1 and stuff, but nothing can compare to this musical metal-punk msterpiece that is CKY. Absolutely, get this and play it nonstop...because it gets no better.In conclusion, ""Infiltrate Destroy Rebuild"" has an awesome sound and beats making you edge for more. Deron Miller's vocals will leave listeners on the edge of their seats. CKY, you have done it again."
5,Excellent Album!!!,"This album is awesome. My favorite song is ""Attached to thehip"". CKY is a completely different sound of rock and you know what? It's worth listening to. I wonder what they'll do next?! I recommend this album to....... just about everybody!!!"
5,Excellent a must buy,ok i had been meaning to buy the first CD but had no money and when i have my b-day i bought volume 1 i couldnt stop listening to it for days then like a week later i bout infiltrate destroy rebuild and it blew me away it was so original and kickass its impossible to stop listening to it YOU SHOULD ALL BUY THIS CD ITS WORTH THE 11.99 YOU'LL SPEND 5 stars excellent
4,seems like i've heard this before,"camp kill yourself's early stuff was much more raw and original. i'm not saying this is a terrible album, it's not. to me it sounds too much like music such as nickelback and less like the good old edgy punk rock that i wanted to hear from them. this album is a good find for anyone who likes pop sounding rock. i own this and it's a good addition to my collection but i still wish that they remained the same cky as in previous releases."
5,Perfect,"Well....once again, these guys pull it off. I'm not sure if there's another band on Amazon that has all 5 star ratings. But of course, that makes sense! Anywayz, I was quite worried about how this album would turn out. However rather than being dissapointed, I got more than I thought I would get! Infiltrate-Destory-Rebuild is a masterpiece, check it out.Oh, and see Jackass the Movie too!!!"
1,"Plain, boring and childish","They claim to be a revolution in music, yet all the tracks are almost exactly identical. The songs are mediocre and their lyrics are simple and childish. They need to quit preaching their superiority for they are not superior over anything. Even a monkey with a stick and a banjo has more creativity than these sorry excuses for musicians. Avoid at all cost. Try some Blue Man Group. Much better."
1,Back To Say A Few More Words...,"Since I got Sibelius 3, Finale 2004 has been a nice little icon on my desktop.People say to ""spend time with it"" but in today's high-stress, fast-paced industry, I don't have that kind of time.I also don't have time for bugs, etc.My co-workers and I, in both platforms, used Sibelius 3 the first week of it's release, on two very large musical shows, and we had NO PROBLEMS! NONE!It seems like those stuck on this program (Finale) have been using it for so long that switching to something new would be ridiculous, and I guess I can understand that because I was an Encore cross-over and it took me a long time to wean myself from that program... but I really had no choice.I gave several programs a chance, including Finale, but I'm musically savvy and not much of a computer person, so Sibelius was a dream come true.I think the best notation program is one that allows me to be musical, not technical. Musical = Sibelius. Technical = Finale. Choose the one that's right for you."
1,Actually Zero Stars,"Finale. Grrr. This software is badly designed. It is too hard to learn (I can't be that stupid, I did graduate from Yale). It doesn't make sense. It doesn't conform to straight forward software behavior standards that we expect like with Word, Photoshop, Pro Tools, etc. It looks kind of old and dumpy in the interface. Way too many buttons and toolbars and dialog boxes. Like the program itself, the Help is difficult to navigate and hard to decipher. There is a new version every year - but the usability doesn't ever improve - except for really simple things. (They added a ""Start New Score"" wizard. Oh boy!)"
5,Heartwarming Family Entertainment,This is another of my childhood favorites. I never thought I would be able to find it on DVD. This is definitely a film to add to your collection.
5,Love It,"I have loved this movie since I was young. I ordered DVD and got the VHS, so it went back, but I'd recommend the movie to young and young-at-heart of any age...have the box of tissues handy though. Disney at its best."
1,disappointment,"I remembered this movie better, more familyfriendly than it is. I am very picky and therefore this one found its way into the garbage :("
4,"entertaining for kids and can speak to adults, too","I enjoyed this movie. It's a story that is a bit strange and could even qualify as a fable. It's an entertaining tale for children, but it also deals with the childish attitudes we mature, stable adults can unknowingly get into, as well. I can't imagine a cat lover not loving this movie."
5,A story with heart,"Thomasina captures the view of a cat with perfection. She (the cat) is lost from her first family by an accident - a diagnosis of a fatal, contagious illness which results in her being ""put down"" by the father of the family - a hardened veterinarian who has shut himself off from the world. This also cuts him off from his daughter Mary, who loves the cat with a special attachment. Apparently, though, the shot doesn't take - Thomasina survives to live with a loving ""witch"" who nurses her back to health. The vet in time meets the so called witch who opens his heart, and ultimately reunites father and daughter. This touching tale is perfect for all members of the family, but remember the tissue box."
5,"never released in UK, Why?","My Wife & Son love this movie but I guess as it was never released in the UK nor can you get this on region 2 not many people have seen it here, which is a shame because it's a great film, so do take the effort to buy it and stick it in your PC or multi region DVD player to watch it."
3,Three Lives of Thomasina,I am from Australia - I cannot watch this DVD because it is in an American format.
1,This is a boring movie!,I watched this movie and I fell a sleep so many times that I can't event count them it was that boring! I can't believe people are giving this five stars and saying it is a good movie because it is so the opposite!
5,Don't let the cover art fool you,People who admire the work of Patrick McGoohan will enjoy this production. His portrayal of Andrew MacDhui projects the cold exterior--and thinking--as well as the vulnerable heart underneath.The children will be watching the cat. A lot of their mothers will be watching him.
5,Thomasina,"This was an excellent movie for the whole family. Charming, funny sad and heartwarming. I would recommend it for anyone."
5,outstanding movie,"for the cat lover, the lover of things celtic or just the person looking for a well-made family movie with a compelling story line,fine acting and the obligatory thematic moral.....this is the movie for you!excellent audio and video quality and full-size keep case.the excellent price doesn't hurt either."
5,For cat and animal lovers everywhere,I have just seen this movie for the first time with my youngchildren and loved it. I hadn't seen this film as a child andwould have driven my mum and dad crazy for a cat if I had.We have a family cat and my daughter is mad about cats andpicked this out because of her obsession....she loved the movie.She now wants to dress up our cat like Thomasina.....great movieand a lovely meaning behind the story too.
5,Pleasant Memories,A flashback to the past when life was full of simple pleasures and humor. A great movie for cat lovers.
5,Such a sweet story.,"I remember this movie and story from my childhood. I have 2 granddaughters now and have been able to share it with one of them. I have actually bought this movie twice now. Once for me and this most recent copy for my granddaughter who just loves the movie. A heartwarming tale of a little girl, her pet kitty and her widower father who is a vet and the local ""witch"" who saves them all."
5,The Three Lives of Thomasina,I bought this for my sister. This was one of her favorite childhood movies. Reasonably priced and recieved fairly quickly.
2,Raw Truth: The Art of Preparing Living Foods,"I bought this book because I thought it would be fun to try some raw food. I'm not a raw vegan, but was looking for some variety and change to my diet.For being on an leisure ""raw"" diet, this book didn't appeal to me. There are no pictures, and the recipes that I have tried were not tasty. In fact, one of the soups was really bad. I know there are better books out there than this one!"
2,There are better books out there,I haven't obviously tried every recipe in the book but the ones I did were not very good.
4,Jarvis,"Jarvis being Jarvis Cocker's 2006 release and his debut album and included such hits as ""Don't Let Him Waste Your Time"" and ""Fat Children"". The booklet is really nice with many fine photographs and the lyrics are easy to read. For each track we also get a list of whom played what. 4/5."
3,"solid effort, but not as good as PULP","This is a good pop record with some decent social commentary. It does not compare to a PULP record such as ""We Love Life"". The music is muchstronger on the PULP records, but I guess this is to be expected of asolo effort. The songs are good, but the emphasis is on the lyrics notnecessarily the arrangements. Jarvis has a lot to say and he says it well, but I will always prefer the full band dynamic. I do like the""instructions"" Jarvis gives for listening to the record -hilarious. Thereis a hidden track about 30 minutes after the end of the final listed song.Its a bold protest song that is unlike anything I have heard in long time.I would recommend this disc, but its not spectacular and we have seenJarvis can be just that."
3,It is Okay,"While I love listening to Jarvis Cocker sing, I can't say this is the best thing I've ever heard from him. I do think it is an improvement from the last of the pulp albums that came out, but there is still room for improvement."
1,It doesn't work.,"My laptop actually overheated faster with this product underneath it. The way the product is quilted prevented the fan in my laptop from being able to suck in the air it needs to cool the computer. Too bad--it's a great idea. Unfortunately, the product description is too good to be true."
3,"Just ok, haven't see any obvious improvement of cooling","The pad is received as described. However, it was a little wet at the bottom of the pad. Even the dryer is wet."
3,Has issues,"This is a decent product for someone like me, who likes to use their laptop on their bed. It does help keep it cooler a little longer and does help with airflow much more than being on the mattress directly. Unfortunately, when the laptop does start running hot, the top of this pad gets VERY hot and actually takes longer to cool down than the laptop does. I have to make sure to take my laptop off the pad to let the laptop cool down."
4,pretty good,"This product works pretty well, but it is not a perfect solution to a laptop heating up. The pad after 3 or 4 hours become saturated and can no longer cool the laptop. If you use your laptop for extended periods of time, you almost need two of these. One for under the laptop and one cooling off for later use."
1,Leak at first use,"It leaked at first use. It is awfull.I tried to complain directly to ThermalTake, and they didn't answered."
3,I-xoft Fanless Notebook Cooler,"This item showed me that there really isn't anything that can cool your laptop any better than already having a laptop with good cooling. I love the technology in this item however, the crystals inside of it liquidate when heated so that they draw heat from the system. My laptop is a very old Dell from 2004 which uses more resources for basic stuff today rather than a laptop made 2010-2011 which would probably use like 10% - 1% of computing resources so this is probably the reason for the huge amound of heat generated from my laptop. If you have a decent laptop and not an overheating clunker like I have, then by all means GO FOR IT. The price is pretty good too."
5,Great portable cooling pad,"I bought this cooling pad for a couple of reasons. One, I was buying a new laptop (Dell Studio XPS 16) that does run rather on the hot side and two, I was going to use the laptop in a place that power might be in short supply and portability was key.So far, when I use the laptop without the cooling pad, the palm rest on the laptop do get rather warm. However, when the cooling pad is being used, the plastic is about room temperature. I've used Thermaltake's products for years and know that if their name is on it, it'll work just fine and this does. I'll be able to fold this up, place it in my back pack and use with ease overseas.So far, no complaints and I fully recommend this product to cool your laptop."
4,"Great concept, but not as good as active cooling","The idea of passive cooling is a great concept, but it doesn't work that well in reality. The i-Xoft basically acts as a pad to shift heat away from hot areas of your laptop, pretty much like how heat pipes work. It also makes your laptop bearable to use on your lap, as the underside is much cooler than the top.I have a Thinkpad T60p and it doesn't make it as cool as an active laptop fan. I guess it does lower the temperature of the CPU area a little and it's the only passive cooler on the market."
3,50/50 results,"My husband and I had bought 2 of these for each of our laptops. Mine works fine the laptop does slide a bit on it, but I was expecting that from other reviews. However my husband's doesn't seem to work at all; the pad doesn't seem to cover the air holes, but his laptop overheats more rather than less."
3,Functional but not effective,"While the physics of how it works may be valid, I can't say that for it's functionality in actual use. This is being sold as a notebook or laptop cooler. Very few laptops that I know of when used in a lap (their intended purpose) bend. This pad (looks like a quilt) only works of then entire surface of what's being cooled rests on it. If you use your laptop on a flat surface then I think this is a great silent idea.But if you use your laptop on your lap, there are significant problem. Not the least is that I don't know may laps that are flat. So when you put this under your laptop, it will sag over your legs like a blanket while the laptop is supported by the highest point of your lap or leg. It does keep your lap cool because it separates your skin from the laptop. But as for cooling that laptop (while in your lap) it's a dud.I'm going to look at one of the aluminum rigid lap desks, coolers."
3,not a single novel!,"it amazed me that there are no novels in this book. it is a strange collection. don't know anything about the criteria the editor used. this collection contains an ok story by blackwood (the damned) and a great one by metcalfe (the feasting dead). other than that, just uninteresting stories"
4,A very good album by a ex spider from Mars.,"Mick Ronson was and will always be a great backup musician. He is primary known as the lead guitarist for David Bowie band the Spider from Mars. This all ended one night in the 1970s, when at the end of the concert, he announced to the band and the concert goers that he was disbanding the Spiders. After night he recorded two albums and backed up Ian Hunter ( ex of Mott the Hoople.) and Bob Dylan. Of the two albums that he recorded that bared his name; this was by far his best. The songs are upbeat and bouncy. He took his time recording the album and it showed. The best song on the album is Billy Porter. A song he wrote himself. Others he borrowed from Pure Prairie League and Lou Reed.If you was a fan of the British Glam period, this is a welcome addition to you library."
3,life on mars,fyi - its not a cover of Bowie's magnificent life on mars but a completely different tune
4,"Ronno, we hardly knew ye...","With an appreciative nod to the great players still around, it remains a sad fact that the most gifted guitarists always seem to leave us long before they should. Mick Ronson places toward the top of that list. Contrary to the typical bio, Ronson's career spanned a much wider spectrum of accomplishment than just being ""David Bowie's guitar player"".He produced a number of other artist's albums, guested on countless sessions, and released several excellent solo albums, of which this was one of the best. Ronson may not have possessed the world's best singing voice, but with that unbelievably transcendant guitar tone and sustain, who cares! The re-issue also features a generous helping of bonus tracks of varying quality and/or historical interest. Required listening for guitar afficiandos."
2,the medic: life and death in the last days of WWII,"I was disappointed in this book. Maybe I went into it with too high an expectation. I knew going in, it was a dramatized version of Mr. Litwak's experiences but I expected more insight into his job as a medic. there were relatively few scenes of his actually work. In that way, I would say the title is misleading. It really is a book of one man's army service in Europe during the later days of World War II. He seems to have disliked everyone he served with and Mr. Litwak has the right to be. there were more sex stories than medic stories. the Sgt. Lucca story I thought would help me gain more insight into the author. But it left me looking for more of an explanation of how Mr. Litwak really felt. Did he like the Sgt. or not? He seems to have been hurt by his death but I am not sure.Thebook overall does help one experience WWII from a more realistic standpoint. But a non-fiction approach would have been more of a contribution."
1,Disappointed,I never read far enough into the book to find the enjoyment that others have written about. I found the book to be full of profanity and the details about his sexual experiences disgusting. I couldn't recomend this book to anyone.
2,disappointed,"was disappointed at the selection on this cd, and thought there would be so many better artists. the 60s and 70s had greatmusic, this is not worth buying"
4,Southern Baptist Angst,"In this self-described ""grown man's coming-of-age story,"" Judge Martin Clark meanders through Bedrock Baptist Fundamentalism wherein there's no such creature as a minor sin - ""There's the straight, correct, narrow route, and the rest is just Plain Heathen Mischief.""The Second Book of Clark is literate - the language sings and zings. Naming a major player after that whiner in the OJ saga is inspired. Though it doesn't have the magical mysticism of his first, ""The Many Aspects of Mobile Home Living,"" it's still Plain Heathen Good. He socks it to insurance companies and American Gumball Jurisprudence like Jeannie C. Riley's Momma socked it to the Harper Valley PTA. /TundraVision, Amazon reviewer."
4,What else could happen?,"This is definitely the story of Job. I couldn't put the book down once I started it, but I kept thinking ""how can this guy be so gulible?"" As usual, I got into the characters and Joel (Job?) was someone I felt for. When I hear myself saying to a character, ""don't do it!"", I know I'm into the book. His sister, Sophie, was remarkably believable in her no-nonsense, out-of-patience take on life. Of course, if I had a brother like Joel, I'd be the same way. What a fun read. This would a good book for discussion in a book club."
3,The Devil in the Details,"This is a solid, entertaining caper novel with unfortunate pretensions to more. The theology is heavy-handed, clumsy, unsubtle (especially by comparison to, say, John Updike's handling of similar material in any number of novels, including the passingly similar A MONTH OF SUNDAYS, about a minister sent to a home for wayward preachers after a series of affairs with parishioners), and the comedy is, alas, uncomic. That said, this is a cleverly plotted, fast-paced, mostly likable book . . . especially when it sticks to its greatest strength, the knotting and unknotting of a tangle of deceit and fraud."
2,Disappointing,"There appareantely are two different authors with the same name. This isn't the same author who wrote Legal Limit. I found this book very slow going, without much point. When I was through, I wondered why I had bothered to read it."
2,Not a fan,I read his other book (Mobile Home Living or something) and this was no better. Boring at best.
2,Just a so-so read,"Story-averageEnding-somewhat predictableCharacters-not transformed at end, just more experiencedLanguage-curse words common"
3,"It was ok, not great, not bad, just okay","For positons, I'd give it 1-2 stars. For information, it was better. The information was pretty basic, but I did learn some things about how a guys mind works with sex. Not at all expensive, so I think it was worth it."
1,mine didn't work either,although the rest of the disc captures SOD at their best...it freezes at track #34...and goes no further. consider buying this one used from someone who has it already...i believe there are SOME good copies of this dvd out there
4,"Once again, Deveraux makes me want to time travel!","This new novel of Deveraux's ranks up with her best.She delivers all the neccesary ingredients to make the perfect story; one that lasts throughout time. I felt especially in tune with her character Katy. I too have a talent for the culinary arts, and I too have been taken for granted because of them. What Katy gains from these experiences is something unforgettable. She learns that she is a talented person who not only deserves more than she thinks, but also discovers adventure and her man in black. I have discovered my man in black and I would never let him go. Before such a time in my life ,every Deveraux novel I read made me long for someone like her characters. And now I have him. Now every book of hers brings me nothing but pride and joy. Thank you Jude!"
2,Strange,"I am a devoted jude fan, but this book wasn't definitely to her usual style. It was completely confusing and a bit boring. The characters are a strange and the whole book somehow unsatisfiying. If this is your first Jude book, don't be put off, usually she is a great writer."
2,Quite entertaining...,"...but not very memorable. There is some time traveling, some confusion, some passion.. Ok, but nothing special."
1,"Interesting premise, but she couldn't pull it off!",I liked the idea of this heroine being more voluptuous than what you normally see in romance novels. I liked the premise of the time-travel. I felt the author had an opportunity to show how Kady grew and became more confident after her experience in Legend 1873. I had hoped that she would have come back with a new sense of self. Unfortunately she just picked up where she left off. She waited six weeks to finally come to her senses. I couldn't believe the author wanted us to believe that after Ruth begged her to look into her descendants she would just come back to her life as usual. By the time she does meet up with C.T. Jordan in New York the relationship seems forced and completely unbelievable. This was the first book I have read by Jude Deveraux and I really don't understand why she is so popular.
2,Disapointed,"I was disapointed with this one also. I have also read all of her books, and I don't know, this one was too weird. Maybe I am biased because I don't like time travel stories (though A Knight in Shining Armor wasn't bad)."
3,I'm hesitant to read her other books,"I found this book to be a little interesting up to the point where Kady met Cole, then I started getting tired of it. I did not like Kady nor did I feel any sympathy for her. Reading this was more of a chore. I am glad that I borrowed the book rather than buy it. I might try ""Knight in Shining Armor."""
3,Not one of her best,"Jude is my all time favorite author and I was very disappointed with this book.It was a bit slow,at times confusing and,well, boring..I thought the book just ""jumped"" around too much and the characters were not that interesting...Maybe she was on a very tight deadline when writing this book...I still love her though."
3,Disappointing,"I'm still struggling to make it through this one! Jude seems to be relying a bit too much on the ""time travel"" theme...""A Knight in Shining Armor"" had to be her best novel to date and she seems to be trying to recapture the magic of that story. Unfortunately, the plot line in this one is threadbare and I have yet to sympathize or find interest in either of the main characters. I'll report back when I'm done; perhaps she gets back on track in the last third"
2,TWO DAYS WASTED.,"This is one of those novels that would have really worked better as two books. Not only did the heroine fall in love with two guys in the short space of a few weeks- while thinking that she is in love with a third- but the whole book is so bogged down with unnecessary characters and implausible plotlines that it becomes downright confusing at times. The author seems to have lost her sense of direction while writing this book and as a result, the book would have worked better as a farce than as a work of romantic fiction. It simply leaves too many questions unanswered as well as a very dissatisfied feeling in the pit of your stomach.And just who is Kady in love with anyway? Can you really tell?"
3,Interesting story,"I enjoyed the cook motiff used in this book; as a romance, though, it was kind of boring. Plus, there is a major, major plot hole at the end which makes no sense re time travel. Without spoiling the ending, the book falls into the trap most time travel stories encounter... the paradox of time travel. And this time, the paradox is SO large one cannot just brush it aside. (Even though its been six months since I read it...) But all in all, it was an enjoyable read, but nothing then eye candy."
1,This book was TERRIBLE!!!,I'm amazed that so many people enjoyed this book. I was very disappointed by it. The best way that I can think of describing Legend is by calling it LAME and BORING to the highest degree. I am so glad that I borrowed it from the library and didn't waste my money on it. I would give this book zero stars if I could
1,And then the little boy woke up!....,"I am so disappointed in this book! Knight in Shining Armor was excellent. This book has more emotion and time spent on food than on the characters. I found the characters most unsympathetic, the romantic tangles unbelievable, and the time-skipping skips a few in terms of emotional credibility. If you want to read wonderful descriptions of food with emotional impact, read M.F.K. Fisher.If you want a romance that has a hero who is not a jerk, (either one), don't read this book!"
2,Just didn't care of this one...,"I've read much better JD books than this one. Maybe I would have liked it better if I had read it when I was 17, but at 30 something, I just found it to be on the verge of dumb! The biker girl (ugh), no real hero, didn't really like Kady.... anyway, my 2 cents"
1,URGHH I couldn't take it!,"I so did not like this book, too many reasons to count. Started off just ok, then got a little interesting, then bam very bad. Im a fan of Jude Deveoux's and other Romance and time travel books, however, this book was really annoying. Just when you think the book is going in one direciton it totally changes, and not for the better. At one point i tossed my copy across the room, my roomates still talk about it. it was just really frustrating and unsastisfying."
5,LOVED IT,"This was a wonderful book. It kept you on your toes the whole time. I never wanted to put the book down. Usually while I am reading I tend to skip ""Blah"" Paragraphs, I didn't do that with this book. It was very interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves romance novels."
3,Could have been a riveting 1000 page novel,"This story has a good premise, and with some character development and plot development, this has the potential of being a really good book. There are some really good ideas, and some really good plotlines, but they need to be developed. Also the book was really anticlimatic."
4,Unusual Time-Travel,"'Legend' was somewhat different than previous time-travels I've read. Our herione spent just about as much time in the present as in the past. It also was unusual to have a herione that felt that much for more than one guy. (you'll have to read it though to see which one she ends up with!) The story line was definitely unusual, and therefore, I enjoyed it for that reason. I can also say that the story definitely kept moving - it never got stale like a lot of stories do while the characters get to know each other. Also, this is one of those books where you can really see the herione ""grow"". She started out a little dippy (& blind!) but she really did grow up and take responsibility for herself, I enjoyed that. Yes, I think 'A Knight In Shining Armor' was better, but I was definitely not disappointed in 'Legend'."
5,i think Legends is the most awesome book i've ever read.,Legend maybe just a imaginary story but i feel the characthers Jude create truly come alive. I imagine myself as Kady as she travel through the time. I really feel myself in love with Cole Jordan and also Cole Tariq Jordan. I believe everybody who read the book will fall in love with it. I hope the place call Legend really exist.
5,"Did you like ""K in S A?"" Well, here's one for you...","If you didn't figure it out, ""K in S A"" is my favorite book ""Knight in Shining Armor."" Anyway, getting back to Legend. I loved it, it was everything I expected, and even more. Another reason why I love it so much is that I too had dreams of a mysterious man, and he turned out to be my sweetheart that I plan to marry. If you're into time traveling and romance, I suggest you read this book, but I've read other reviews, so you might not like it as much as I do."
5,Legend.......brilliant.,"As I looked through the racks on one of my regular trips to the library, I could not find any books that I hadn't read by my favorite author. So I was browsing, as I often do. I came across ""Legend"". The outline on the back cover interested me, so I checked it out. The only thing that comes to mind when I remember the story is....BRILLIANT. Deveraux outdid Coulter with this book, in my opinion. The storyline was intriguing, keeping me on the edge of my seat. There was romance, mystery, humor....you name it! It was such a nice change from what I usually read, historical romance, that I instantly fell in love with Deveraux. Now, I am a devoted fan. I read everything of hers I can get my hands on. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a fast pace, humorous romance. Sit back and enjoy this book. I have bought a copy for myself, and enjoy reading it time and again!"
2,disappointing,"I wouldn't even bother trying to describe the plot of this book because there really isn't one. The story drags on and the love scenes are unoriginal and dull, very unlike Jude Devereux. The main character basically gets transported to different times and places and her actions become very hard to distinguish. The storyline is very hard to follow and there is no climax. Overall, this book was a complete waste of my time and I was very disappointed with Jude Devereux's latest project."
2,Disappointed,"A knight in shining armor was the first dude deveraux book that I read. I loved it and fell in love with time travel. So I rushed to get Legend and Rememberance. I read Legend first but I was really disappointed. I agree that the first half book was great while cole and kady were together. but as soon as cole disapppeared from the storyline, it's getting weird to see how farfetched it was to bring the T man and kady together. So many loose end with no answers. the wedding dress? It would definitely be a GREAT book if she concerntrated just on cole, ghost or not. Now I am afraid that Rememberance will turn out to be the same as this one."
3,Too many heros,"I liked the beginning of the book. I liked both the heros, Cole and Tariq but it just doesn't work for a romance novel to have 2 heros unless there are also 2 heroines. I like the time travel twist but not the bit where you suddenly find out that the adult Cole was just a figment of his own imagination. I think you could have either a time travel romance novel or a ghost story romance novel but I'm not sure about mixing both of them and then killing off your hero half way through the book to replace him with another."
4,"Really, really enjoyed this!","Well, you already have the summaries. I also agree with some of the readers that a lot of loose ends needed to be tied. But overall, I really became glued to this book from Chapter 1. Loved the characters. Loved the time-travel aspect. Loved the culinary aspect. Made me interested in food science/wild herbs. What would I do without my modern day cooking conveniences? Could I rough it in the wild? I just loved the simplicity of the story, the story-telling, and the unexpected twists and turns it took. I felt like I jumped right into the town of Legend and really hated to leave it. Having lived in Alexandria, Virginia, it was nice to hear about some old stomping grounds mentioned, like Tyson's Corner Mall. Cole really was addictive. Loved him. The story never gets boring. My first Deveraux book (based on the ratings/suggestions here), but definitely not my last. Just checked out ""A Knight In Shining Armor"". Thanks for the recommendations guys. Hey, Great Job Ms. Deveraux!"
3,Convoluted...Unsatisfying storyline gone in too many directions,First of all...I'm just not crazy about the heroine Kady with a 'd'. She is a pig who eats anything that won't eat her back regardless of the century she has been catapulted into. I much preferred Cole as the leading man/Hero and think Jude should have stuck with that storyline. Too many threads and just not enough substance to make it enjoyable. Loved Knight in Shining Armor that is a much better time travel / historic romance. She laid an egg on this one.
2,"OK, but if you really want a romance...","I'm still listening to Legend, about 3/4 of the way through. It's ok, but starts out really slow. Not sure how it's going to end. I actually picked this book up while I'm waiting on some others I have on reserve. I've been reading some of the other reviews and have to say, if you really want a great romantic/time travel book with some substance, read something by Diana Gabaldon. Better yet, listen to the unabridged audiocassettes read by Davina Porter -- They're OUTSTANDING!"
5,"Wonderful Book, Now a Favorite","I was lent this book to read by a friend and once I started to read it, I couldn't put it down. Ms. Deveraux kept me interested from begining to end. Since then, I have bought my own copy and have read it several more times, to many to count. To the contrary of what others have said, the second half of the book dealing with Tarik is my favorite. I tend to just read that part now. Kady is a very relateable character in her flaws and I can see a bit of myself in her. I found it interesting to see how she dealt with the situations that she was given. I do admit the part where Ruth Jordan enters the story is confusing, but if you can get past that part, it is worth the read. It is correct that the epilogue doesn't answer everything, but I believe that it's a highly enjoyable book to read. :)"
5,I love Jude,"Jude Devereaux's Legend is a great book, if you like well written escapist fiction with strong female characters and romantic settings."
1,i want my money back....,why make me fall in love with cole if he wasnt even the main character? how can u be in love with 3 different men? i dont find that at all romantic. i bought a knight in shining armor for only a dollar and that was one of her best. im surprised to say this but this will be my last jd book...
3,"Cole=good, Tarik=eh","I liked most of the book. I adored Cole, found my self warming up to him. The twist was interesting, but Tarik's inconsistencies were a little too much to handle. By the end of the book I didn't know what he was telling the truth about and when he was lying. At least with Cole you got his point of view more. But still worth reading on a rainy day."
5,one of the best!,one of the most wonderful books i've ever read. i just fell in love with the characters and the best thing about it was that it was not predictable like many other romance books. highly reccomended.
3,Nice Combo.,"First things first- not everyone appreciates Grouch as a producer. But, he has this simple asbtract beauty to his beats that I just love. On top of that- I love the combo of Murs/Slug. Although Im not a huge fan of Slug in the least beat I can definitely bump this album constantly and be pleased with it. It has a few missing pieces to make it a classic or a 4 star album- but Its definitely worth a purchase and a few listens."
1,The Grouch Kills This Album,"First of all, Murs and Slug are freakin tight and I dont care what anyone says but Grouch's beats bore the hell out of me! They're so tacky and plain and dead. Ant's beats on Felt 2 are better."
3,Good but not great.,"Cactus Flower is a cute and harmless film, but its dated and kinda corny now. Goldie Hawn is so adorable in this movie, no wonder she won best supporting actress, she's a hoot! Walter Matthau and Ingrid Bergman are great together, I just love them. Cactus Flower may have a few thorns but it is much-loved by fans so give this film a chance."
5,Love it!!!,I love Ingrid Bergman but aside from that this movie has some clever wit and funny goings on! I enjoyed it its one of my favorites. It's one of Goldie Hawns first films and she looks so adorable in it! Walter Matthau as scandalous as ever. Recommend if you like classic films and legendary actors.
4,ENJOYABLE VIEWING,WE ENJOYED THE MOVIE. LARRY HAD NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE AND HE KIND OF ENJOYED WHEREAS I HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE AND REALLY ENJOY IT. I LIKE WALTER MATTHAU AND I BELIEVE THAT WAS THE LAST PICTURE THAT INGRID BERGMAN MADE. IT'S A FUN MOVIE--CLEAN--NO SEX AND REALLY NO SWEARING.
3,Cactus Flower,"I saw and enjoyed the re-make ""Just Go With It"". I learned that the original production was ""Cactus Flower"" which starred Walter Matthau, Goldit Hawn, and Ingrid Bergman, three of my favorite actors. That prompted me to buy it on line. I liked the movie but I didn't enjoy it as much as the re-make. I thought the plot was too fragmented and lacked continuity."
5,Dirty married bachelor!,"It's just ""rotten rotten rotten"" what some dentists will do to keep from marrying a ditzy girlfriend. Julian (Walter Matthau) pretends to be married already so his truth loving girlfriend, Toni (Goldie Hawn) won't press him to marry her. When she attempts suicide, he realizes that he wants to marry her. Toni agrees only if she can meet the wife to prove that she is not a house/home wrecker. Julian comes up with a wife (Ingrid Bergman.) Toni can see that Julian's wife still loves him. Throw in the neighbor that only wares a towel, Igor Sullivan, Senor Sanchez (Vito Scotti,) a Mexican missile and a wild party. And that is where the fun begins.Seems Like Old Times"
4,Cactus Flower has laughing power,"The 1969 movie version of Abe Burrows' hit Broadway play ""Cactus Flower"" although a bit dated still has the ability to make me laugh. The stand out here is an impressive movie debut by Goldie Hawn (in the role of Toni - originated by Brenda Vaccaro on stage). Her cupie doll looks and sing songy voice give her character just the right naivete needed to pull off this role. Ingrid Bergman as Nurse Stephanie (played on stage by Lauren Bacall) is hilarious in a bit where she mocks the latest dance of the period by creating a new dance called..The Dentist! Walter Matthau holds his own as the philandering dentist who leads Toni into believing he's a married man with kids in order to avoid a more ""serious"" relationship with her. All-in-all a worthy movie version of a great but long-forgotten play."
4,Nice filter,It is a bit pricey but it does seem to do the job. Bring the price down a few dollars would give it another star
4,Another good buy,This is an exact replacement for the Polaris 280 and is a fine mesh bag. The purchase price was about 35% less than what the pool supply stores wanted.
4,Plolaris Sand/Silt Bag,This product works as designed. Happy with the product. Nothing exiting. the product was delivered on time. I like Amazon service.
5,Zippered Bag beats Velcro closure hands down,"The zippered bag is the one to get. The Velcro closure model seems convenient, but gets clogged easily with debris. It also is harder to empty the Velcro bag, because the Velcro wants to keep closing on itself. Though the Velcro model is $10 cheaper, it is not worth the hassle. Spend the extra bucks on the zippered model. You will be much happier."
5,Great - but buy 2,"This bag works great. Amazed at all the sand, algae, and dirt this bag collects compared to my old one. Wish I would have purchased a second bag as it's so much easier to empty when it's dry versus wet and muddy."
2,Good while it lasted...,"Purchased this along with several other filter bags (leaf and standard) for our Polaris 280 which has been in service for over two years. The filter worked well to remove fine particles, but only lasted several months before it began to tear.I wouldn't recommend it long term, maybe for occasional use...in any case I wouldn't purchase it again."
5,A New Milestone In The Evolution Of Mathematics Textbooks,"This remarkable book, prepared under the general editorship of Harvard-professor David V. Widder, contains an original approach to basic logic and a novel axiomatic treatment of the real number system.Written and formatted in an extraordinarily clear, concise, precise, and readable manner, this unique work provides invaluable training in logical and creative thinking. It is ideal for beginning mathematicians, logicians, scientists, and engineers."
1,Not same as pictured above!,This is not as the same in the photo! it is a knock off. it is close to however because I own the seat in the picture. But dont be fooled about what they are selling you!
2,POOR QUALITY,ONLY 9 OUT OF THE 10 LED LIGHTS ARE WORKINGAND THE ON-OFF SWITCH FEELS LIKE IT'S GOING TO FALL APART ANY DAY.
5,Basic Grammar in Use,"This book is one of the best grammar books I have ever used. I use it in concert with the Intermediate level. It provides clear, step by step, concise explanations for our rather difficult English grammar to speakers of other languages. The explanations are on one page and the exercises on the next, making it easy to navigate."
1,missing CD,"For the first time in ordering used books from Amazon, I was very disappointed. I usually buy books in the $3-$5 range. This one was $15. It was advertised in good conditiob and the description said it included the CD.When it arrived, I would put it in the poor condition catageory and there was no CD included.I am very disappointed."
5,The media would benefit greatly from reading this book.,"My name is Christina Tonseth -- one of the several people who proofread Dr. Reeb's book. I found Dr. Reeb's prose to be captivating and influential, and his subject timely and universal. Journalists vow to be objective in their reporting of events, but often that isn't the case; pure objectivity is impossible to achieve. 'Taking Journalism Seriously' is a must-read for all potential and current journalists trying to find a compass in the nasty world of politics."
1,Reeb Fails To Practice What He Preaches,"In a scathing editorial in the Barstow Desert Dispatch on Febrary 14, 2007, Reeb blasted the local school district for allowing a Gay-Straight Alliance club to form at the school. Using self-referential logic, Reeb frequently puts quotes around words such as ""tolerance"" and ""lifestyle"" impugning their significance. He then indicates that equal access laws regarding High School clubs applied only to Christian organizations, and not to other groups. He fails entirely to objectively evaluate the culture of institutionalized bigotry and further maligns gay youth in an already hostile world."
4,nice album,"Ginsberg's on-and-off fascination with photography left some intimate records of the lives around him. We see a slim and young full-mopped Ginsberg, smiling on a ship ""smoking what,"" and candid shots of Burroughs, Kerouac, and other less famous Beats as they interacted with each other. You will find that there's much more to the camaraderie of these guys than just trying to get laid (re: the other review)."

5,give the highest praise,"this album is tremendous and uplifting. It will usher you into the present of God. Clint Brown takes you from total praise into genuine and sincere worship. The power of the Almighty is working thru-out, removing burdens and destroying yokes. By listening to this piece you will definitely be delivered and set FREE! This project is a must in any collection."
1,Wouldnt buy again,"I purchased this a little less than 4 years ago. Yesterday the screen started flashing. Switched cables, cards, etc.Monitor is bad, and no warranty remaining. For what I paid, I would expect it to last longer. Wont buy Samsung again."
5,"Big, bright, and beautiful","And expensive, but you get what you pay for, and look closely at the specs of those cheaper big screens before you buy."
1,I've been Ama-scammed,"It looks like a nice monitor. I ordered one on 1/1/2008 for $703.79 . On 1/4/2008, the order was cancelled. I was surprised given the monitors age. It couldn't be out of stock.Upon checking, I found the problem. Amazon cancelled my order so they could raise the price to $789.99. Big thanks to Amazon. I ordered the better reviewed BenQ FP241W from elsewhere. Watch out for the price hikes. They are unannounced and after you order. May be better to go elsewhere...Paul"
2,Not reliable,"We bought 5 of these at work. Out of the 5, 3 died within the 3 year warranty. We got a Samsung 2693HM as a warranty replacement. It died after being in service for 1 week. Awaiting replacement on 2 that are currently out on warranty, and hoping that Samsung takes care of the 2693 as well.I will definitely NOT be looking at Samsung for monitors and/or TVs in the future."
5,Nice item,"Nice show and it's really not boring to watch them. The deal was fast, good and not complicated. The package was good and there were no issues."
4,Easy to use,"I got the Lund tri fold for my F350 to use when I have my camper off the truck. It arrived and there were no instructions in the container. Turned out there was really none needed. It goes on easily, is easy to use and offers the protection to the stuff in the truck bed that I wanted protected. Surprisingly, you can fold it up to the third nearest the cab and there are fasteners to hold it there. Altogether, it is well designed and works easily and well."
4,Great book for older elementary age readers,"Heroes, Gods and Monsters of the Greek Myths was a gift to a young man (12 years old) who said he really enjoyed it."
2,Wasn't what I expected,"Not a bad book, but it wasn't what I was expecting. More appropriate for older children, as opposed to upper elementary."
4,An easy-to-read approach to the Greeks,"While this is not as sophisticated as Edith Hamilton's ""Mythology"" or as academic as other texts, this one adapts the Greek tales in a very reader-friendly way. One can easily get a sense of the drama, intensity and personalities of these ancient heroes and anti-heroes.Though it is not as jam-packed as others, the vocabulary is accessible and the long list of vocabulary in the back shows the clear link between the Greeks and modern civilization."
5,Great resource. Great for story telling. Great gift.,"A handy resource for upper elementary and middle grades. Simple entries, only about 2-3 pages long. Includes glossary of terms derived from Greek myths, from aphrodisiac to volcano."
4,It was alrite,"My class read this book as an assiginment. It was very exiting and adventurous. Some parts, though, were vague."
4,The book,"I didn't think that the book was all that great... the author alludes to other Gods, but then doesn't include them in the book. He does this with other types of stories too. For the purpose of the book, as an informational book, it hits the topics dead on. It's not that bad, but I don't think that it deserves 5 stars"
3,"Heroes, Gods, and Monsters review",The book i bought was ok except for the fact that it was missing pages 38-41. I would have liked to have been notified of this fact.
3,coolmom,Bought this for school my 13 year old son said it was okay...he didnt seem thrilled but might have liked it more if it wasnt assigned.
1,Poorly done,"Just making up this review to make aware any potential future buyers, the book would perhaps settle for a primary school book about 7th to 10th grade. Because it is very poorly written, word choice is thin at best, and in general it's primary use is entertainment with no educational value. I purchased this because I was interested in bolstering myself up prior to diving into Greek tragedies, and had been reading a free book available from Guttenberg but was looking for something in addition, which this failed miserably to measure up to.This review is a copy of another Greek mythology book, I bought them at the same time, this book was just as dismal in its execution as the other."
5,very good,This is a very good book. It gives the Main Idea of the individual gods. It also kind of gives Bernard Evslin point of view on it to.= Persephone Hall
4,Book Review,"This book is a good quick reference for the multiple characters of Greek mythology. I bought it for my wife because she is now a big Percy Jackson fan. So, i scored major points because it was a little more thoughtful than a 12 pack of beer. Anyway, this is a good book to use as a reference. I don't think it's something you would read for enjoyment cover to cover but still the book is interesting."
5,An Absolutely Excellent Book,"Evslin does an oustanding job telling the most famous of the greek myths and does it with his hands tied or does he? Evslin wrote this book, I think, intending it for a young audience, and so does not delve into the prose that others have when attacking these greek myths. Yet with simple language and direct verse, he quite excellently brings out a depth in the characters and a second meaning in stories which have rung hollow or been lost by other, supposedly great poets. Even if you don't fancy yourself a myth lover, this is an excellent read and easy, yet thoroughly satisfying."
5,Greek Mythology turned into fun!,"It was soincredibly interesting and fun. not only did I enjoy reading the hella cool stories, i learned that Greek mythology does affect our language today. i learned how alot of things now, came from what we learn in mythology. the stories are so entertaining and fun toread, Sime are sad, some are happy but all of them kept me flipin' pages. I'm happy I read this book because it gave me knowledge about history and it made me know cool stories and I liked Disneys Hercules alot more. I felt smarter watching it. it a great book, props to the auther who wrote it in a non boring way. Thanks!"
2,Not for middle schoolers,"Recommended in Well-Trained Mind but WAY too difficult for that age-level, and the writing is somewhat old-fashioned and dry. This one was the most readable of the set for us, but still better as adult reading."
2,Poor quality,"I bought this book for my daughter's school assignment, and the book was all amrked up with notes in pen by a previous owner. She couldn't even read some of the lines on the page, because of all the markings."
4,Great stand,"This is stand is easy to put together. It has extensions for your wireless device. It's adjustable heighth is good, but could be a bit taller. It hold my 15"" well but is strong enough to hold a larger but would look odd. Decent stand with one of the more better heighth adjustment options."
2,Hard to Assemble,"I love the height this riser gives my laptop. But it's been a real pain to put together. I finally figured out where all the parts are supposed to go, but still haven't managed to make it secure. It currently is in danger of tilting and sliding my laptop onto the table, because I can't get some of the parts to click together right. Maybe there's a magic formula I'm missing. The paper instructions didn't help at all."
2,Poor quality,"At first sight, it looks good but its quality is really poor (terrible). It was cracked after 30 min use. I am returning it.."
4,great for working at home,"i recently starting working at home several times a week, and I found that the table I was using did not have enough room for the laptop AND an external keyboard. This product fits the bill and is also very sturdy. It really makes the best use of limited space and I would recommend it."
2,It's ok...,"The 2 pieces to the left of the pic. were lost within a few months of owning the stand.I thought to use it as an alternative to letting the laptop burn the desk; it got so hot.All in all, the purchase was 'ok'. The construction was good and durable."
3,Does the Job,"It does the job and is functionally what it is promised. So if the price is right (in my opinion, half off the list price) then consider it. It's well designed. I gave it 3 stars because ""it's okay."" It's not aesthetically wowing due to its plastic composition. It goes well with a plain black notebook. If you have an apple or some other more pricey machine, you might consider investing in something a little more fancy."
5,No surprises. Just as advertised. Excellent price,"This riser was sturdy, very adjustable and just what I hoped it would be when I ordered it. Plenty of room for a docking station and laptop on the top. I put my KVM switch underneath."
2,Not worth the price,"I was expecting something sturdier for how much it cost. At $30, I feel ripped off. It's cheap plastic and adjusting it is challenging for fear of breaking the legs.Thinking of putting a laptop on it? It's so deep that their little ""stick-em non-slip stickers"" will only touch one end of your laptop. Poor design!I do not recommend this product!"
1,Very disappointed,"I bought this thinking 3M would make a good product - I was wrong. It is a piece of poorly designed cheap plastic. For instance, there is a very limited range of height adjustment. In fact, it ended being too tall on a workspace surface, and I could not adjust it lower. Not to mention, the platform does not tilt making typing very difficult and uncomfortable.Spend the extra money and get a good product."
3,Does what it says it does,I really like the side accessory trays ( holds my cell phone so I dosen't get buried under papers). Wish I could find the optional copy holder. The one thing that I don't like is the laptop screen is set far away from you. After 50 it is difficult to see. A more vertical orientation of the laptop would solve this problem. Wish I had known this before I purchased this type.
4,Very Good Product; Very Good Value.,"Received it, unboxed it, unwrapped it, tried to assemble it. I'm missing the instructions for this. My fault? Don't know. I keep looking. Everything else is good, approaching great. I love 3M--nearly everything they make. Have Macintosh laptop. Next, I'll find the 3M instructions on-line.Review from me at this point? Pleased. Happy. Contented.dkenneth"
1,very unhappy customer,"This could have been a really good grill that would have lasted a lifetime. However, the first one I recieved had deep groves in it from poor casting. Amazon replaced it with another. The second grill had the same grooves and large deep divits created from someone trying to use a grinder. I dont recomend this to anyone since you will be disapointed with a grill that could be great if it was manufactured properly."
5,Exactly what I wanted,This product works great. Takes up half of my stove and does a great job at cooking everything for bacon to pancakes so far. I definitely recommend this product.
1,warped on arrival,"When this arrived, it was horribly warped and unable to lay flat. One of my primary uses for this was supposed to be pancakes, but I can't make pancakes on a curved surface. I will be returning this item. (Unfortunately, Amazon's only other 28"" griddle is more than twice the price, so I'll probably end up with a smaller one.)"
3,Might work well in the right setting,"These might work well for a campfire, however I purchased two of these to use over my gas stoves in my house. I have two drop in gas stoves and wanted larger griddles for cooking large amounts of food for breakfast. These do not heat evenly and are very difficult to clean and even harder to store. The storage problem might be unique to my kitchen, so that was not reason for the three stars. These did not do the job I was hoping they would do. They are very heavy and could cause damage if dropped on your foot or even on a tile floor. If they would heat even remotely evenly I would have been very satisfied."
4,Beach Visitors Beware,"I read this book while vacationing at Folly Beach, South Carolina. I loved the factual information especially the history of the development of the barrier islands However, the doom and gloom undertone predications got a little heavy handed after a while. It seemed like the book was a warning to anyone thinking about moving the the coast to stay away. Upon further inspection, it turns out that the ""living with the coast"" series was underwritten by FEMA!. An enjoyable read anyway."
4,"Songs about growing up, love, McDonalds Girls,Larry's Car","Great Cd, for all ages but especially for 30 somethings, Best served with a bottle of wine and the one you love.If ""Love is real"" doesn't fill up your head with memories of young love, Then you need to check you have medical insurance. Hey Larry is one of my fav tracks but all will take you down memory lane....Except nookie in the mail ! Don't quite understand where that song is coming from ! A must have for you collection."
2,A review?....,Well I didn't like this cd very much and for the price I paid it wasn't really worth just one song....
5,Good Reading For Every Christian Woman,"This book had a great impact on my life, especially as a wife and mother. Many times, the things she advocated made me resentful, because they demand that I die to my own will, and treat people the way GOD wants me to treat them, whether they deserve it or not! I loved her way of prioritizing things, reminding us that our husbands and children come before anyone else, and that our families should never doubt how important they are to us. Walking in God's path isn't easy, and it is a relief to hear an author encourage us to take the hard way, instead of the easy way!"
2,Take the Good and Question the rest,"When I got this book I read it in 2 days. It is an easy read and it is possible to take some good ideas away from it. I agree that our priorities should be God, husband, children, ministry, etc. The problem I have with the book is also in the husband arena. In one area she talks about submitting to your husband in all things, even very small things, like which lamp to buy. I found this hysterical - why would a man who loves you care which lamp you have? My fear with this book is that someone reads it and takes it all as ""gosple."" You need to have a solid head on your sholders to be able to take the good and leave the questionable in this book. I do think that her husband advice probably works if you have a good husband but this advice could be very damaging to a woman who doesn't. This book is our Bible study book now and I'm anxious to see what the other ladies think when we get to the husband section."
5,Inspiring,I absolutely love this book. It's one of my favorites and I am an avid reader. This book really inspired me to make some meaningful changes to my life. One of my favorite things about the book is how she talks about picking five topics that you want to become an expert in and studying up on those topics so that you become an expert in a few things rather than knowing a little bit about a lot of things. This is a very practical book and I believe that anyone who follows the advice in this book will see improvements to their life. I will definitely recommend this book to other women.
5,Excellent,Excellent book for our women's bible study. I would recommend it to others for the same purpose. It has excellent personal insights.
5,Getting Closer to God,"We're only on Chapter 4, so it's hard to review the whole book -- but so far, it's been great. We have 11-15 ladies in our Bible study and they love it. I'm looking forward to teaching the rest of the book and learning a great deal. Good study book whether you're a new believer or been one for a long time."
5,Women Growing Beautiful God's Way,"Elizabeth George has put together a series of Bible study books to help women grow in the Lord. She shares her deep desire for her own growth and with her fluid and personal style, she invites the reader to dive into God's truth with her. It is an exciting adventure full of discovery and wonder at the beautiful design of the Creator and our personal relationship with Him. The study guides are put together in a very user friendly manner, whether for personal study or study with a group of women. Her Bible book series is very well done, but this book contains great beauty and is foundational to understand about a woman's walk with God."
2,never received correct book!,I ordered this workbook and was sent another book instead. I mailed it back and they are saying they never received it so I can't review this book because I never received it and didn't get a refund!
1,Too Over the Top,"We did this book in our Bible Study & found it to be way over the top. Submissive to husband, never just sitting down, staying home everyday except one, wait on husband & children without any expectations of anything in return. This book tries to put women into this little box. No - I can be a Christian woman without all that."
4,Great for the Christian Woman,"I have had a difficult time finding good, solid books on Christian living for women but this book is one of the few I have come across. If you need some guidance about how a good Christian wife and mother should act, this is the book for you. This book really helped me identify the areas of life that I needed to work on to be the woman that God intended me to be."
5,Great Book!,Very helpful in ones Christian growth. So glad that I purchased this book. I would recommend it as well as others by Elizabeth George
1,not a book for today's woman,The book is to old to really do any good in this day and age. Did not agree with much in the first 16 chapters. Chapters 17-24 were more in tune to things I were looking to engage my mind.ALL in ALL - I would not recommend the book to anyone. (UNLESS) someone wanted to read 1/4 a book.
3,Becoming a Godly Woman,"I read this book with a good friend of mine and we both learned a lot from it. I have only been married for about a year and a half, and I have stuggled with the idea of submission, because all my life I have been so independent. Elizabeth George has some very good things to say in this book, and some that I really didn't agree with. The main takeaway from the book for me is that women's priorities should be 1)seeking God first and foremost 2)being an awesome wife to your husband and 3)being a Godly mother and good example to your children. It did help me to realize that a big part of Christian living is to serve and help others, not to focus so much on yourself and what is most convenient for you."
5,"Exceptional, motivational, inspirational!","Each chapter offers a Godly perspective of a woman, wife and mothers role in the home and in our world. I am not done yet and am anticipating the next chapter. This is one to read, re-read, highlight and make notes in. If you are looking for a biblical approach to life, and how to do it in a Godly manner this is a must read! You will be totally blessed by it."
5,Great Read,"This book is very helpful for anyone wanting to improve their relationship with the Lord. I read it years ago, and it was invaluable. I liked it so much that I bought it again for my kindle."
1,As tasteless as water...,"without any of water's redeeming qualities.I couldn't watch more than thirty minutes before I gave up. The opening scene, of a young girl masterbating with a vibrator when her family walks in, was bad enough. Why did this ... director also have her family pull the blanket off of her? So we could see how the out of control device was firmly imbedded into her private area? Or because it would appeal to a certain demograpic (perverts/pedophiles/incest fantasies)?No, this was certainly Not Another Teen Movie."
1,Barely passable as a movie.,"If this had been done as an Saturday Night Live skit I might be more forgiving but I expect more from a ""movie"". Yes there are a few funny scenes (most of which are direct parodies of either ""Pretty in Pink"" or ""The Breakfast Club"") which were really well done and the odd references to ""Better Off Dead"" but all in all this movie is a swing and a miss! The overall plot line is from Pretty in Pink but that is the best we get. There are all sorts of opportunities through out the film for funny side gags and other stories but the director and screen writers seemed to want to bludgeon the viewers into submission with too many potty gags.I ended up watching only about 55 minutes of the film before I hit fast forward on my DVD player in started skimming. Definately a yawner...."
3,"Funny in some parts, stupid in others","When I first saw the commercial for this movie, I got excited. I love stupid movies. I saw it the 5th day it was out, and the first part of the movie was OK. Then the middle bored me. Then the end was funny. The humor is nothing you wouldn't find in Kung-Pow or Scary Movie. But behind every stupid sentence, there's a laugh that escapes. Only rent this if Scary Movie is out at the video store."
3,"Ok, but too shallow for any real laughs.","This movie was far too dependant on taking other teen-movie's plots and gag lines instead of making an actual spoof of them. The plot's pretty basic and somewhat predictable and the acting rather average, but there are some good laughs, even if they are rather shallow. Most of the scenes that have been taken from other movies - like the promise to loose thier virginity in American Pie - have just been packed into random places to try and fit in as many as possible, without really contributing to the overall storyline.But overall it's pretty watchable, and sure to raise a few laughs, but it's not up to the standard of the classics like American Pie and American Beauty."
4,Funny Movie,"This movie I thought was a a little bit better than Scary Movie. I rated this item a four because some scenes were just to unbelievable and it doesn't really keep you laughing all the time. It has a sick sense of humor. The toilet scene of the girl was nasty. I hated that. It made me laugh, but it was gross. Chris Evans(the jock) had some good parts, but he said and did some really shocking things and things he said was quite shocking. Which I will not mention. The cruelest girl which is The jock's sister was funny, but the kissing scene was gross. I thought the girl on the cheerleading squad with terrets was really funny. The characters all did a good job. The dildo scene in the beginning with the Stupid Ugly Girl was funny, but it was put in a nasty way too. I wish or hope they make a sequel with all the same characters. The movie all I can say was really funny and shocking at the same time. I can't wait though when it comes out on DVD!"
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"The main problem with this movie is they attempted to be clever by making fun of some recent teen movies, but they did it in a very lame and unfunny way. If your going to make a satire, do it so it's very funny. But the problem with this movie is, the movies they are making fun of are good movies, and this movie just [stinks]! This movie strikes me as the kind of movie that was written in about 2 days, no depth and no wit. Young kids, I would say between the ages of 10 and 14, will probably find this movie funny because that's the level this comedy is at, very immature and very poorly written. Nice try but this one is a major strikeout. The writers of this movie may not want to quit their day jobs as the day shift managers at the local Dairy Queen. But after this flop, they're going to have to find another source of income, because they sure as heck don't have any talent as writers."
1,The Trailer is significantly funnier than the movie,"I'm only writing this review because Amazon ""recommended"" this flick for me. There's really not much to say about this movie except that if you've seen the commercial you've enjoyed yourself a lot more than if you've had to sit through the full length feature.The gags are funny - in theory. In practice, the director, uhm, how should I say this...is [poor]. He has absolutely no sense of COMIC TIMING, which is essential in a comedy. Hence, you're left watching a joke, thinking this should be funny, but yet you're not laughing. Go with something like Screwballs, 100 Girls, American Pie, Porky's, or Scary Movie instead."
3,Could have been better,"This movie successfully parodies popular teen movies such asCruel IntentionsThe Breakfast ClubJawbreakerBring it OnCan't Hardly Waitjust to name a few. The parodies of these movies were very funny, and the reason why I give this film 3 stars. Unfortunately, the main plot of this movie is a parody of She's all That--in which the ""popular jock"" makes a bet to make the ""pretty ugly girl"" into a prom queen--which falls flat on it's face. Too much time is spent on these scenes, which are tired and lifeless. Chyler Leigh and Chris Evans are initally funny in their respective roles, but these 2 could not carry the movie as it's stars. Maybe if this movie had been more balanced between all of the teen movies, it would have been more successful at being funny."
4,Take This Over Scary Movie Any Day,"Though there aren't many famous people in this film besides Sean Patrick Thomas and Melissa Joan Hart and Randy Quaid, it's funny and something people will enjoy. It's setting involves a local high school and much talk about the prom, the football team, and how people are unfairly divided up and judged at this level of their lives. There is always the ugly girl that gets the makeover to end up better-looking and stuff like that. This didn't win any awards, but it's something to do if you've got an hour and a half to spare."
3,"Teen movie vs. Scary Movie,, Winner by far, SCARY MOVIE!!!!","This seems to kinda copy Scary Moive witch Scary movie wins by far,,, YEs I give it a lot of credit it took teen movie's even from the 80's it is pretty funny, The diologe copys to much of ""She's all that"" But really push's the fantesty world button really hard witch makes it annoying, Yes it is funny and is a good movie to watch while hanging out with frineds, BUt truse me it lose's its magic after the 3rd or 4th time. Rent it but dont buy it!!! o yea this is not a movie for the enite family eather!"
2,Had to force myself to laugh,"This movie is whack. I am not some old prude with no sense of humour. I enjoy a good spoof complete with vulgarity, profanity and every thing else. This movie simply was not funny in the least bit. The jokes were beyond predictable. It was gross but unfunny. It took cliches to another level. I had to force myself to laugh. Scary Movie and even Epic Movie were better than this piece of trash."
4,funny,"Hysterical. Contains crude jokes and nudity, so I wouldn't recommended this to teens under about 15 or 16. It's basically based off of 4 other movies."
3,Good Spoof,"I was pleasantly surprised by this parody of teen movies. It satires the current wave of teen movies such as American Pie, She's All That, and Bring It On. The satire works because it challenges the stereotypes that the viewer is supposed to blindly accept in other teen movies, such as the 'token black guy' and the sexy exchange student.The best example is the satire of She's All That, where the school jock bets that he can turn the nerdiest girl in school into prom queen. Just like in She's All That, they choose a girl who is very attractive but wears glasses and a ponytail, as this that is enough to make someone the nerdiest girl in school!This movie relies heavily on bodily humor, and is decidedly low brow. If you like this sort of humor, this is right up your alley. Also has some nods to the eighties reign of teen movies: Pretty in Pink, etc. Enjoyable."
3,Brilliant Start but Loses its Edge Further On,"The beginning of this movie shines as a most daring over-the-top send-up of the high school flick genre. The daring reaches its zany peak with the collapsing potty parody. Then it's rather downhill from there. Perhaps that's inpart because what's being spoofed is already so preposterous that the spoof can't melodramatize it much farther. Still, I believe it could have done better. The ending was lame and uninspired. If one wanted to make a case that Molly Ringwald is washed up as an actress, one could find lots of support for that in her cliched ranting in her cameo toward the end."
4,"Actually, surprisingly, very funny","I am NOT a fan of crude comedies. Animal House, Superbad, Knocked Up- hate all of them. So when I caught this on TV, well, I was stunned. It pulled me in and really, really made me laugh. The ""Jamie's got a gun"" scene may be the hardest I've ever laughed during a movie. A great cast (Jaime Pressley! Chris Evans!) makes this comedy really work."
4,Smells Like Teen Spirit,"If you've ever seen any of the teen movies ""Not Another Teen Movie"" spoofs, you will find this movie absolutely hilarious. I found this movie absolutley hilarious. There are some parts that are completly unbelievable, I was thinking whoa, they went WAY TOO FAR. Some of it was a bit excessive, like too much of a good thing. One of my favourite parts was the kissing scene between the teen-age girl and an old woman. (was this spoofing ""Never Been Kissed?). The old woman says ""are you for real?""...that line totally cracked me up, I was thinking the same thing she was. I didn't care for the ending, but overall, this movie had me LOL."
4,Great DVD package...,"As far as extras on dvds go this is definitely one of the best ones to come out in a while. There is an unrated version of Marilyn Manson's ""Tainted Love"" (complete with some female nudity), the trailer, special promos, behind the scenes footage, commentaries, and much more. If you like this movie, then buying this dvd is a must. The extras alone make it worth the purchase."
3,Yet another teen movie,"""Not another teen movie"" is just that - another teen movie. There are about 5 actually funny parts in the entire movie and the rest is fluff. The movie tried too much and tried to parody too many movies at the same time as staying in the plot ofShe's All That. This movie is only good for pointing out which movie it is parodying. The cast was pretty good though and they tried to deliver a funny movie, but it just was too much thrown in the same melting pot."
3,"funny, at times crude","This spoof movie covered a lot of ground. Numberous popular movies were parodied - and in pretty funny ways. There were lots of little things that were funny, usually inconspicuousily in the background. It get's a bit crude at times, were you want to turn away and wonder why you're watching this movie, but the overall funniness put forth was worth the price. The actors did a great job, the women were all beautiful."
3,Decent Movie,"The first half of the movie was the funniest thing I've ever seen, the second half sucked. Thats all there is to it."
5,this is the best movie ever,"this movie has everything. nudity, comedy, and most of all, chyler leigh. she is sooooooooo dawn beautiful. it would be better though if they showed her naked. but it was a very funny movie."
5,"rude, disgusting, and enjoyable","I can't believe I'm giving such a BAD movie a 5-star rating, but that's what I'm doing. I must be the craziest man alive!Not Another Teen Movie is an all-out disgusting and twisted movie. Not a single moment of the film I thought was normal, in any way. When the movie came out, I remember the previews didn't exactly give off the impression that we were going to see such an incredibly twisted movie, but that's what we got here, folks.If you're a teenager you will LOVE the movie. Even if you're an adult with a twisted sense of humor you will love it. I feel the movie is really bad because it constantly tries to go for the most outrageous scenes imaginable, but I couldn't stop laughing the entire time. I love it. I love a bad movie!"
4,My son loved it,"I bought this movie for my son, I have not watched it, but he loved it and I could hear him laughing with his door shut. I think its a winner"
2,it felt like i was watching the teen movies it was trying to make fun of,"this movie plan out sucks but the music is good.'funny at times and sometimes not,, if im in a good mood i might watch it but prolly not"
1,NAUSEATING!!,"this was the worst movie i've ever seen. it wasn't even funny. i watched it for 1/2 an hour and i didn't laugh once the whole time. after that 1/2 hour was up, it didn't get any better.by the time the 2 main characters started singing that sappy-stupid his/hers-break-up song, i was physically ill. i turned the thing off and had to restrain myself from breaking it. i'm seriously considering smashing the thing.what have we done to deserve such drivel?? this is why i hate movies. it pains me to give this movie 1 star. i'd LOVE to give it 10 anti-stars. it deserves no better."
1,Absolutely terrible,"This movie was absolutely horrible. It was rude,crude,obnoxious and very offensive. It was actually insulting to the movies it parodied. The only reason I gave it one star is because that was the lowest rating I could give it."
1,How Could Someone Like This?,"Outdated Jokes , Bad Acting , Just A Horrible Movie With One Shining Point It's A Spoof Of Spoofs."
2,The opening sequence is disturbing,"This movie starts out with a teenage girl masturbating and being walked in on by her dad, her brother, her grandmother, two little kids, and a priest. Once they're all in her presence, the object she's masturbating with flies out onto her birthday cake.Needless to say, this is NOT a movie for kids, and not funny enough for adults either."
1,where do I start,"where do I start with this sucky potstinky, crappy, smelly, awful, spoof of spoofs that really suck. though my favorite person here is the wannabe chinese kid. otherwise it is like, kill me now. how awful could it of gotten, awful. with crude and distasteful jokes that just get to old, this one shouldnt of happened period."
1,Not Another Awful Satire,"Not Another Teen Movie satires the teen movie genre but it has no plot, it just a mishmash of skits satirizing teen movies in popular culture such as Bring It On, Pretty in Pink, The Breakfast Club, Can't Hardly Wait, American Pie and American Beauty. The premise of satirizing high school movies was a promising idea but Not Another Teen Movie turned it into a completely dreadful mess. The jokes you can see coming a mile away as it was this crude, vile, filthy potty mouth humor which is suitable for a fifth grader. The trailer for this movie was more entertaining than the entire movie itself."
2,"Aims low, but what do you expect","I saw this dvd the other day and I didn't really have high expectations so I wasn't that disappointed. The movie skewers most of the recent teen flicks and even some of the classics from the 1980's. The movie, pretty much follows the story of ""She's All That,"" and the few good bits in this movie center around that movie. The rest is mostly unfunny gross out bits that I expect are supposed to appeal to the late teen and early twenty something crowd. Honestly though I think even the target audience will cringe at most of those. I mean a couple of incest gags? A twenty something girl making out with an old lady? Ewwwwwww! The one orginal scene that had me rolling was near the end where the lead character explains to Laney what the future of there relationship would be. That scene alone gives this movie an extra star. There is a cameo by Molly Ringwald that is also cute. Unless you are in the mood for a teenage ""comedy"" that relies on grossout, I'd pass on this."
2,Yup...Just Another Teen Movie!!!,"While it starts off well with its spoof (or remake) of American Pie's opening scene, Not Another Teen Movie does not manage to hold up. In fact, it has so little to spoof, it quickly becomes one of the films it's attempting to make fun of. That's never a good sign for a parody. If a comedy is unfunny, then what are the chances that its spoof will be funny? Not much. There are a few good laughs here and there, but definitely nothing we haven't seen before. Some cute references to teen comedies of the past do little to save this mess. This is a very lame attempt because every modern teen comedy has already become a spoof of the superior ones from the 80s. This is just a pointless attempt to cash in on the success of Scary Movie and it just doesn't work, which is a waste, because I felt it had potential. One of the few times I was wrong."
2,Come On!,"Come on seriously. Its like its a movie begging to be bad. It is even worse, if possible, than Scary Movie, which was at least semi-funny. I mean I guess I can see why you might watch it, if you've seen all the movies that it spoofs (which is a lot, although the plot basically follows She's All That), but its really just disgusting. To be honest, if you like this kind of of thing, you might enjoy this but its just palin stupidity if you actually want to see something good.(Oh yeah, one thing I like was that this movie features Good Charlotte, which was kinda cool)."
2,Aptly entitled,"Well, I had low expectations for this movie, and it delivered on that.It might have been a clever flick, but instead, the makers insisted knocking off a scene or two from about every ""teen"" movie in the last 20 years. Therefore, it looks like a mass fingerpainting of a movie, tied together with a few gags.Unfortunately, all the jokes are just plain uncreative and offensive, either disgusting, perverse, or racist.Save your money and see one of the ""original"" teen movie, which are usually cleaner and more creative."
2,Not at all what I thought it would be!,"I hardly ever buy a movie before I view it, but I thought that this would be a great movie, so I took a chance. Never again will I buy a movie without seeing it first. There were very few funny moments, and for the most part, it was just dumb. I love most of the movies that they used to make fun of, but they really didn't make things funny, at all! This is definately a movie I would watch before I waste money and buy it."
5,A very funny spoof on all the teen movies,"Ok, so I am reading these bad reviews on ""Not Another Teen Movie"" and I am wondering if I saw the same movie as them. This movie was so funny I was almost rolling on the floor in some places. The movie is initially a spoof on teen flicks such as ""She's All That"", ""Varsity Blues"", ""Can't Hardly Wait"", and many others. The movie was well acted by the whole cast. The jokes were very well written. The movie contains amusing cameo's from Melissa Joan Hart and teen film veteran Molly Ringwald. This movie for everyone who has seen the teen flicks from the past 15 years. They don't only spoof ones from the past 3 or 4 years they get them all. Funny and well written."
5,Non Stop Laughter,"This is the most hilarious movie i've ever seen. Way better than scary movie 1 or 2. I did not stop laughing after the first scene till the end of the movie. If the comedy wasn't enough the movie is full of topless scenes, definate 5 in my opinion."
2,Too disgusting for it's own good,"The DVD quality is nice, good selection of features and Manson's video is great. The film was written with some humor, exposing elements of dumb teen movies and thrashing them well. Though it was too sickening, too gross with a poor ending, it just wasn't funny enough. I especially dislike seeing it in Widescreen format, as it's just not artistic enough to justify (sorry, WS lovers). A lot of detail cannot be seen on most tvs, I have a new 27"" and WS just isn't suited for films of this type, unless you're watching on a comp or 16:9 tv (which aren't so numerous). They should have included both versions on two discs or made it dual-layered."
1,"Awful, horrible and appauling!","Next to Vanilla Sky this was the worst movie I have ever seen. Normally parody movies amuse me to no end but this one was simply appauling. It takes a great deal of effort to offend me, but this film did emmensly!It's title and previews suggest that it is a funny teen movie however this movie is definately not for teen's at all, aside from the enormous amount of bad language, the sexual content alone makes this film closer to an X rating then it's soft rating of R. To be blunt, to rent or buy this movie you have to be eighteen, and I wouldn't even get this for my seventeen year old sister because it is so appauling!Parent's beware, your kids might want to see it because of the misdirrecting previews but believe me, unless you want the facts of life poorly explained to them through a movie that most parents have discribed to me as soft porn you definately do not want to get this for your kids...."
1,I Cannot Believe This Movie Ever Saw the Light of Day,"Not Another Teen Movie is easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. This moive tries so hard to be scary movie it's just sad. Basically, what they are trying to do here is out-gross scary movie and rake in the profits that scary movie did. They succeeded in out-grossing scary movie and the result was just plain gross. Not Funny at all. Let me say that I liked Scary Movie a lot so let me put the speculation to rest that if you liked scary movie you will like this. That is wrong. Dead wrong. This movie is just plain embarassing. It's embarassing for the cast and the writers and anybody else who had a hand in this travesty.There were 3 or 4 funny parts that made me chuckle (hence my one star at all) but overall, if you own this film, you should bury it with a shovel then bury the shovel.Overall, extremely poorly written. The writers of this script hopefully will never be able to embarass hollywood like this again."
3,5 stars for the soundtrack...2 stars for the movie,"The movie was a pretty typical ""teen"" movie, a lot of nudity, profanity and corny jokes...However, there was some pretty cool music (some were coversongs) from the 80's. There were also some cool scenes from 80's movies, they did an reenactment from the ""Breakfast Club,"" That's the only reason why I would only give the movie 2 stars."
2,Good for some laughs (but it should have been much funnier).,"Spoof of the teen genre is mostly middling, but does strike inspiration with its take on stereotypes (The Token Black Guy,The Cocky Blonde Guy, The Pretty Ugly Girl) and their behavior. The first half-hour is pretty damn funny, but the movie starts to lose momentum as it runs along, until it runs out of steam entirely by the end. Gotta love that naked foreign exchange chick (played by a sexy Cerina Vincent, who has a body to die for), though. The DVD features 18 deleted scenes, a lot of which are actually pretty funny, moreso than many of the scenes that were in the actual film itself.** 1/2 out of *****"
3,N.A.T.M.,"Sort of raucous. Some of the deleted scenes should have been left in as they gave more support to the plot. Overall a different type of movie. Should have been rated a bit higher than "" R ""."
3,"has funny parts, but overall not very good","as with scary movie it has plenty of dirty jokes and a least 1 or 2 funny parts, but movies that make fun of actual GOOD movies can't actually be that interesting. good cast and the women! I say just see how high (rated R for crude sexual humor, brief nudity, and language)"
1,TOTAL GARBAGE,"Just plain stupid, really. The director threw in a scene involving a toilet full of feces that explodes and sprays a teacher and some students at the high school. I guess he thought that would attract the misdirected youth of this country. ..."
1,"Awful, terrible, horrible","Oh my...What a terrible movie! Im not a critic nor intend to be. And yes I love stupid comic movies like Happy Gilmore, Tommy Boy or American Pie,...but...this movie. The movie tries to parody other ""teen movies"" without knowing that with this terrible movie the parody is on them for making such an empty comedy. The comedy may have at the most 3 funny instances, all the rest of this torture take cliches from other movies without the HUMOUR. How funny can it be! Its funnier to make a row on a bank than to watch this movie."
3,Had To Be What It Is!,"This movie is exactly what it is...it paradies the 80's and 90's Teen Flicks. It has some great bits and special moments.It takes itself serious but in a non-serious way. The High School Cheerleader is the stand out perfornce with a bit part by a cherleader with Tourettes Syndrom that steals the scenes.The leads are good looking but shallow and the sem-story is semi-lacking. It's trying to be an ""Airplane"", but it just didn't have the underlying story and the gags that worked - were very short.Enjoyable, but who can beat ""Airplane"", ""The Naked Gun"" or anything by Mel Brooks!"
2,dumb flick...,"This film is downright lousy, even for its genre - _American Pie_ looks witty and profound by comparison. Just about the only amusing thing was the girl with Tourette's Syndrome who can't contain her ... (adjective removed by amazon) outbursts."
2,"OK, not great","OK, first of all, judging by the some of the losers who do not know how to spell or use proper grammar that have reviewed this movie, I guess I should expect THEY would like it, so let me offer an intelligent opinion.This movie had a lot of funny scenes, but a lot were downright crude and disgusting too. The topless scenes and most of the biological function scenes were totally unnecessary. I think some of the funniest parts were bringing in references to some of the classic 80's teen movies which most of the audience (who were under the age of 20) really did not get. My friend and I (teenagers of the late 80's/early 90's) seemed to be the only ones in the theater who GOT all those jokes. I think the movie was OK, but only for the few, selective good laughs. Wait for this one to get to the dollar movie!"
1,sh9itty humour,Dear God... I saw it onTV last night. Well not all. Ichanged channel halfway. Is that what my generation considers humour?
3,"Nothing special, but quite entertaining","!Heather's teenage son!The movie takes 'Scary Movie'-style humor and makes it raunchier & more disgusting & twisted. The film really isn't that good, but it sure does entertain when it's on Comedy Central. I loved the 'Bring It On' part of the film with the white cheerleaders who think they are black. I also loved the song part of the film, plus Good Charlotte performs covers of classic songs and their own in this film. If you find it in a bargain bin for like 5 bucks like I did, then buy it. Otherwise, it's not worth 14 bucks."
3,Another 'She's All That',"This movie is a pretty good spoof of the whole 80's teen movement. Storyline is too similar to She's All That, but nevertheless mildly enertaining. Especially Mitch and his camp as the desperate virgins."
4,Laughing out loud!,"This movie is hilarious! If you have seen and enjoyed ""Varisty Blues"" ""American Pie"" ""American Beauty"" and ""Cruel Intensions"" (and have a sense of humor) you will pretty much get all of the gags. The opening few minutes sets the tone for the whole movie and it really is a good time. It basically pokes fun of all the teen movies made in the past 10 years. This version also includes cast interviews and the making of Marilyn Manson's video ""Tainted Love"" which alone makes this movie worth seeing."
4,Not Another Teen Movie,"I thought this movie was funny and my friends and i still laugh about the jokes and all of that. I thought it was funny because it's so true that there are lables on people in every teen movie. For example the popular jock and the token black guy. I loved how it spoofed The Breakfast Club, She's All That, and Varsity Blues. So I recomend this movie to people who have actaully seen the movies they are spoofing or else it won't be as funny."
2,The worst movie I've ever seen,"I think that it was obvious by the trailers alone that this was going to be a horrible movie anyway, and that's why I didn't bother going to the theaters to see it like most of my friends. I waited until it was on HBO, and I have to say that it was the most painful 80 minutes I've ever spent in front of a television screen. The entire cast is absolutely horrible, once again proving that as long as you have a pretty face you don't need to have a teaspoon's worth of talent to be in the movies. The movie follows the ""She's All That"" format pretty closely, and every time it tries to go into another movie it only confuses the viewer more. My advice? Go to the dentist and ask to have four of your teeth drilled at once. Even that is better than sitting through this pile of garbage."
3,Mixed blessing...,Wilson Pickett was an incredible talent...and purchasing a compilation with a little more substance is probably worth your time. This is a great starter set for beginners.
4,Wicked Wilson Pickett,"As the previous reviewer suggested, this is a good starter collection of Wilson Pickett's music.The popular classics are on this cd-""Funky Broadway"",""Mustang Sally"", ""Land Of 1000 Dances"", and the title track.It's not a complete collection by any means with only 10 songs.But what's on it makes it worth buying, particularly if you find it at a cheap price!The mix of horns,organ,and bass is just right and Wilson Pickett had a voice like nobody else.I generally don't care for cover songs as I feel that they don't fare well in comparison to the original.Wilson Pickett's version of ""Sugar Sugar"" is an exception to the rule!The sound quality on this disc is very good and it isn't one of those cheap reproductions.It's Wilson Pickett's recordings of his original songs.If you want a starter cd for your collection, this could be it. It probably wouldn't be enough to satisfy a big Pickett fan though...."
1,Poor,i really didn't like this movie because it jumped from one thing to the next. i couldn't understand it.
1,Not even one star,"Terrible. Dialogue was constantly mumbled. The plot made no sense, and characters that were introduced were just forgotten about.If you like this movie, you have no taste, and little self-respect.If you complain, ""Hey, it's just one of those movies to trip out on.""Then you haven't seen Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas."
1,"garmonbozia, all right.","See, this movie is yet another intentional turkey in the David Lynch stinkography. When will you people believe me when I tell you the man simply likes to make bad movies?!? The picture comes off as a demented episode of Northern Exposure with the plot-wiring torn out and the character development up on blocks. Throw in the obligatory sinister midget and sundry unemployed freaks and... Weee're in business! Oh, wait... we need something for the characters to do... well, they can all just take turns going insane, can't they? Problem solved! David Lynch is a modern freak show operator. The freak show has never gone away. It has just been billed as something else."
1,SHORT & NOT SWEET!,"NO DELETED SCENES! THE FRENCH VERSION WILL HAVE THEM! AFTER ALL THE TIME AND EFFORT FANS OF THE MOVIE/SERIES SPENT CONTACTING NEW LINE THAT THEY/WE WOULD GLADLY PAY MORE FOR THE DVD IF THE DELETED SCENES WERE INCLUDED... YET THEY STILL CHOSE TO SCREW US OVER AND RELEASE THIS BUDGET-PRICED DINK! (yes, DINK!) DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
5,The finest film I've ever seen,"The Amazon review suggests that anyone who didn't see the Twin Peaks TV series can't understand this film. I didn't see that series, know nothing of its characters, but was much impressed with the Lynch I'd seen to date (Blue Velvet and Wild at Heart). I took in the first part of the film without a problem, smiling through much, and admiring Lynch's guts. Then the real movie starts. I didn't smile at anything else in the film. In fact, I was emotionally numb for about two hours after it ended. I'd never been so shaken by a film. You need to love the main character, to feel this much pain, and Sheryl Lee makes it easy. What does she say to her ""true"" boyfriend--""The Laura you used to know doesn't exist anymore. There's only me."" We get to see if not where the original Laura went then why. Smile through the first part. You'll know when it's over. He's just setting you up for the kill."
4,"Good Film, Bad Special Features","It was nice to be able to see this movie again, and it looks fantastic on DVD. On second viewing, I am very impressed with Sheryl Lee's amazing performance as the doomed Laura Palmer - she nails down every last nuance of her character's tormented psyche. Also noteworthy is the great cinematography and the bold use of color. On the downside, the ""documentary"" which features interviews with cast members is abominable. The film is choppily edited and fast motion is used in one section, I suppose to create a ""cool"" and ""hip"" effect. The real effect is totally nauseating and the inteviews themselves are virtually devoid of content. Those involved in the making of this farce should seek employment elsewhere."
5,Firey Fire Walk With Me,"An absolute must for any Twin Peaks or David Lynch fan. This prequel is much more exotic and racy than the series (obvious reasons, no network television restrictions). However, I highly recommend for someone to watch the series before seeing Fire Walk With Me. It gives the life of Laura Palmer new meaning. The only disappointment is that Lara Flynn Boyle didn't play Donna in this prequel. Even for non-fans of the TV series, this is a great movie, rich with the darkness and symoblism that is a part of all of Lynch's work."
4,So Frustrating!!,"If you are watching this movie for more answers, you're doing it wrong. There is not a lot in this movie that ties up the loose ends after 2 seasons of Twin Peaks. However, it is an interesting look at Laura Palmer's life in a raunchier way than could be shown on t.v. (read: R rating). The back story leading up to Laura Palmer's death is definitely interesting but I would only recommend watching this if you are a true fan of the show."
5,Being a teenager in America,"Twin Peaks FWWM, is a suberb look at the unseen, dysfunctional American family - the bright intelligent teenager rebelling against the hypocritical, maniacal, parent. Isn't that the intent of such parents - to drive the child to the very thing they pretend to want to protect them from. This is the worm that dieth not that exists in every family that destroys more young lives than anyone has the stomach to appreciate, projects from one generation to another, and is something that few parents can ever admit to doing. David Lynch has captured it perfectly."
4,Your Diary: I Always Thought You Knew It Was Me,"I saw the movie during Labor Day opening weekend. Even as a loyal fan of the show it somewhat confused me in parts. But throughout the years of watching it on video and DVD it makes a little more sense.Sheryl Lee and Ray Wise are nothing short of phenomenal as Laura and Leland Palmer. Knowing full well what their fates will be during the film and the TV show, it gives the film a power that resonantes even though the we as the viewers know the outcome.That David Lynch shows that there was some hope for both of them, however brief, makes it very poignant.I hope New Line can re-issue this title as a Platinum Series or Infinifilms edition. Fans deserve to see the deleted scenes and an audio commentary by Lee and Wise, since Lynch doesn't do them."
4,One of Lynch's most brilliant works.,"This movie is completely fantastic. It's like a complement for the series, and to we know how was Laura Palmer, when she was alive. But, for the ones than never watch the series, and never heard about David Lynch, it'll be kind of weird. If you're one of them, start to watch Lynch's works, than watch the Twin Peaks entire series ( Now avaible in VHS ) them watch Fire Walk With Me. But, if you're one of the series fans and you didn't watch the movie yet, have fun ! I totally recommend !"
4,"Brilliant movie, but...","...as a Lynch fan, a big pet peeve of mine is when people wish for a ""director's cut"" of this film, as in the review below. Lynch has had final cut on ALL his films except Dune, and so they all (except Dune) can be properly called director's cuts. FWWM as it stands is the version Lynch supervised and approves of. It's true that a lot of scenes ended up on the cutting room floor, but that's how movies are made. A rough cut is first assembled using everything, and the director and editor whittle it down from there. That said, Lynch has expressed interest in including the cut scenes in a FWWM DVD, but only as separate extras. He won't cut them into the film because he likes it as it is."
1,Really?,Let me start with the fact that I LOVE Twin Peaks. I adore the show in its entirety.This movie is AWFUL. It was absolutely deplorable. It's not worth the $5.I wish I could rate it lower than one star.
2,Ultimately dated,"[I expect to get many Not Helpful votes, as always happens when you dis a movie or book which has many fans. So be it.]If you are a hard core Lynch fan, you may enjoy this. But I found it was very dated. The film is very slow. It is very hard to understand, both in terms of what is going on, and in terms of simply hearing what people say. (Sadly it has no subtitles whatever.)It is thriving on copious amounts of weirdness in all kinds of ways. And ultimately I found it tedious. I am sorry, I really wanted to like it."
1,Unnecessarily Graphic and Crude,"Call me a prude if you like. But the explicit graphics of the sex scenes could have been more subtly done without sacrificing the plot. And Bobby's profuse use of the f word was unnecessary. As one who followed the original series devotedly, and watched the entire series with rapt attention in the Gold DVD Box edition, I must say this turned me off.I understand and appreciate the effort to fill us in on the murder motive through this prequel. I think as a Twin Peaks fan, I would have appreciated a sequel too, one which resolves the tension of ""hero become villain"" in the very last scene of Season 2, as well as the problem of Leo Johnson left with tarantulas hanging overhead courtesy of Windom Earle. The reference in ""Fire Walk With Me"" to ""The good Cooper is in the lodge and can't get out"" suggests that there might have been a solution coming??? But as it is we are left hanging, just like Leo."
1,Great idea poorly executed..,I love Twin Peaks and it's quirky characters so I bought this to make the collection complete. I watch a lot of movies and was hopeful this would match the quality of the series. Not sure what David Lynch was thinking with this effort but I am not surprised it didn't do well - the transition of the scenes were poorly done and not with the ususal style Lynch was so noted for in Peaks. A clumsy effort for a great plot line - a disappointment for sure.
2,Stinker,"Lynch took everything that made Twin Peaks a great TV show and chucked it in this movie. The ambience, the cinematography, the humor, everything pretty much that made the show so enjoyable are absent from this film. Aside from the first segment of the film, with Chris Isaak and Kiefer Sutherland, which was pretty entertaining, what we have is a plodding exposition of events referred to or hinted at on the show, laboriously laid out for us. Laura's secret life somehow seems rather boring and predictable. There also seem to be some continuity problems. In the show, Donna only suspects Laura's secret life. In the movie, she participates in it. In the show, it's mentioned Bobby told Laura he killed someone. In the film, she's right there with him while he kills someone. This film seems more like something made by someone trying to imitate Lynch's style rather than an actual David Lynch film. i guess everybody has an off day now and then? ""Fire Walk With Me"" could've been great."
2,Disappointment.,"I am a big fan of Twin Peaks: the TV series. However, I did not like this movie much at all. All of the humor and humanity of the show is gone, replaced by the usual weird crap and leering sexism that rule the movies of David Lynch. People who haven't seen the show will be wondering what the hell's going on; die-hard fans will be disappointed that the movie contains no new material. We've quite literally seen all this before."
1,New Line Home Entertainment disappoints!,"First, TP:FWWM is an excellent film (by far, one of my all-time favorites). I have the Laserdisc of the film, and seeing it widescreen will set your socks on fire.I rated this DVD release 1 star due to the folks at New Line Home Entertainment (NLHE). I've written several letters to several people at NLHE regarding the missing deleted scenes. Unfortunately, no response (but I'm not surprised). You know, the most disappointing part is the fact they have ""Infinifilm"" technology which could allow a viewer to insert the deleted scenes back into the film (see their ""Rush Hour 2"" DVD release - which I will never buy). By releasing TP:FWWM WITHOUT deleted scenes, it confirms they are just another short-sighted, inconsiderate movie studio. Please wake up and smell the coffee. Lots of Twin Peaks & Lynch fans are disappointed with you!"
5,Fits Very Well With Lynch's Current Mulholland Drive,"I never saw the television show of this same name and, therefore, never was able to compare the two. This is a very dark, dream saturated film, much like Lynch's present day ""Mulholland Drive."" You will discover the dark secrets in this town and one family just as you do in that film, unfolding in non-linear fragments, like a dream, until the reoccurring parts suddenly gel together in your head. He's working with the same big themes as he does in Mulholland Drive, with the added fillip & punch of incest, presented in the most imaginative way possible. This is an absolutely brilliant film and is by no means inferior to ""Mulholland Drive."" It is always interesting to me that no matter what year or decade Lynch films in, he always manages to find one actor who strongly reminds you of him."
1,"Unless you are a Lynch fanboy, skip this steaing pile.",As a HUGE fan of the show I was excited to see this finally released (I missed it in theatres). Having recently re-watched most of the shows episodes I can honestly say that this worse than leaving things unanswered. Most of the actors did a fine job diespite the fact that the script seems like it was written by a 16 year old heroin addict that had only seen a handful of episodes. I have not seen a follow-up this bad since Highlander II.
3,Great Movie (so-so DVD),"Yes, this movie is terrific, one of Lynch's best. I felt, personally, it was better than the series.This DVD, however, is only so-so. I totally disagree with his policy of not having chapter selection. Why not? Sometimes idiosyncratic is just idiotic. If it comes from some sort of artistic integrity, something about the purity of form, then it shouldn't be on home video to begin with. It's nothing more than a poor decision made on tenuous artistic and intellectual grounds.I love the movie and would have bought it even if I'd have known about the chapter issue. Coming as a surprise as it did just totally irritated me.As for his policy of never including a running commentary: artists talk too much anyway."
2,What the Hell was that?,"That is probably what you'll be saying after you see Fire Walk With Me. I stumbled across Twin Peaks recently and have seen every episode. After being disapointed by the cliff-hanger ending I was excited to see Fire Walk With Me but now I am more diapointed than ever.To start with, if you haven't seen every episode, don't even bother with this one. You simply won't get it. Those that have seen the show still won't know what to make of alot of it. The show was symbolic and interesting while this seems weird with no point. This may be because a huge amount was cut from the film but in the end it makes little sense.Thankfully, it still retains the fancinating atmosphere from the show but the fact is that there isn't enough story to back it up. Maybe if they release a directors cut then my opinion will change but untill then, Fire Walk With Me has only degraded my opinion of the Twin Peaks franchise."
5,The greatest movie ever made.,"Like the greatest painting you've ever seen, only moving. Every shot you would put on your wall. And because we know every character from the series, there's no time wasted on boring exposition. Everything has been elaborated on in the show. Oh, and this might be the only film in the world that is both a prequel and a sequel at the same time! Beat that!"
2,Disappointing,"Honestly, I was hoping that this movie was gonna answer some of my pressing questions about the Twin Peaks series, like the origins of BOB and how he ended up possessing Leland Palmer. Instead, it was centered around Laura's last weeks of life, and didn't end up answering any mysteries left behind from the season finale. Plus, where the hell was original Donna?! And there was not enough Agent Cooper. Bummer."
5,Best Moving Art,The movie knows what it's doing. It's non impressionistic even when you know what's going on. Ridley Scott is a wonderful director/songwriter who gets the job done and takes his time. David Lynch is a trip. The movie is horrible to some but they'll never see the children in the movie walking around the outside of school. That is the funniest part in any movie ever and David Lynch knows...Just ask Dino.
3,"Ok, but missing a lot of what made the TV series special","This movie was ok but certainly doesn't hold a candle to the original TV series. Much of the offbeat humor and some of the best characters didn't even make it into the movie. Of course, this is a prequel, so that explains some of it. Nice to see this title on DVD but the special features aren't all that special. Kind of cheap with a thrown in at the last minute feel. Other than that, it's worth having if you're a fan."
5,"Lynch is Brillant, a Peaks fans dream.",Lynch has brought hours and hours of pleasurable and visual fun to peaks fans with the original series and now brings the glory of FWWW. This film brings some answers and some shocking sceens that were too much for television. If you are a peakfreak then this film cant be missed.
4,CRUNK HEADZZZZ,"This DVD was hot! GuttaButta 2 is a big come up from Guttabutta Opelika city limits. Now don't get me wrong the first was hot 2 def!But on 2 they had more famous cameos and they cover more of Alabama. They some of the most biggest in the south like Lil' Jon, David Banner and my favorite Tiny pf Xscape. Ne Ne also reporsented holdind Lee County,Al down. and Lil Chappy did is THANG!!! I gave it 4 stars, i would have gave it 5 but they didn't have Montgomery's own KING MEESEE on there maybe he will be on 3 or 4 we'll see but GuttaButta is hot."
5,Havana night DVD,"Fast shipping,and very good show,I can say is the best Cuban show I've seen in my life,dancers singer and in especial the band ,thank you"
3,American Tall Tales,This may be a good book for Middle School students. I was looking for one for a 7 year old. I could not find one suitable for him. This was the closest one. It may need more stars if read by an older child.
4,"Good Stories, but not to many","I had to buy this book for a folklore class, along with about eight other books and this has good stories, though some of my other books have more detailed versions, it would be nice is this book has some more pictures it has a few black and white ones but nothing much."
3,nice for the money,"I took this rash guard on several surf trips and it's faded / yellowed and stretched out, what I like about it is light weight, white is always best for tropical hot water spots and it's cheap so destroying it is no big deal. It also has no logos which is nice.The bad; it's fairly see through when on, although i didn't get sunburn too bad.. i'd recommend it."
3,Adequate with some reservations,"Picked this up for a recent vacation to Hawaii. Shopping experience was good - prompt shipping and a fair price. Sizing was as expected (ordered per sizing guidance). Shirt did stain somewhat. Waiting to see if shirt can be cleaned before I update my review,"
3,RASH GUARD SHIRT WORKS,"I ordered this shirt for my husband. He was not pleased with how snug it fits, but a rash guard shirt should fit somewhat snuggly since it is worn in the water while diving. It does prevent sun exposure and is cool when you come out of the water. It does dry quickly. Had my husband tried it on prior to purchase, he would not have purchased it. He isn't totally displeased, but not particularly pleased with it either."
2,FOR THE $$ - NOT WORTH IT!,"The shoe itself looks great(if you don't touch it, that is). When I unvelcroed the shoe, the velcro strap looked as if it had been velcroed and unvelcroed many times. After that initial unstrapping of the velcro, it had made the leather strap look worn. My son had not even tried it on and it looked used."
3,quality,"This book is adoreable, the photos are wonderful, but the book quality is very poor. The pages stick out past the book cover, what is up with that ?? Did I get a bad copy or are they all like this??"
1,I am a stay at home mom and find this book offensive.,"I bought this book for my daughter for Christmas. I am astonished by how many positive reviews it has received. It is extremely sexist and the minute she put it down, I hid it from her. As we read the book, the little mommy does housework, takes care of a sick child, makes dinner for her husband and all out exhausts herself. Meanwhile, the boys in the book go to work in the city or practice medicine. I think this book sends the wrong message to our little girls. It was clearly written at a time when girls were trained to be homemakers. It was published in the 1960's. Nostalgic maybe, outdated definitely."
3,Sweet book but not for my daughter,"I still have my copy of this book and it is absolutely sweet. However, it is far too full of old stereotypes of men's and women's roles. There are plenty of newer equally sweet books about family life that give both men and women fuller roles in life than this book does. My copy will stay in my memory box because I loved it as a child, but I won't be reading it to my kids."
4,Enjoyable and Useful,"Good book for beginning imitation play for young children! May be a bit dated, but the sweet pictures and simple role play is great, and I feel this book can be used with boys and girls by simply changing a few words; roles can also be reversed. It can be an enjoyable and useful book to share with little ones."
1,Completely BAD,"This is unquestionably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The ""death"" scenes are all faked, clearly staged, and poorly at that! (The only scenes in the entire movie that appear to be genuine are footage from rabbit and chicken slaughter houses... what horror! :-P) Sometimes unredeemingly bad movies are so bad they're good. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM. Do not waste your time--or money--on this rubbish."
2,Not as good as I expected it to be,"Well I've seen F.O.D. 1 and I rated that one quite highly although they did go on a bit too long about autopsies, but I later read by several viewers 3 and 4 were the best, I think I bought the wrong one by the look of the other write ups and by my own experience and wish I had bought 4. The best part of F.O.D. 3 was the begining when they showed clips of the other F.O.D. videos, It seemed a lot more fake than the original and I was quite disappointed although it did have a few good scenes, you can spot the staged scenes a mile off but I would say overall 40% REAL 60% FAKE. I will risk buying F.O.D. 4 soon I just hope Its as good as Its meant to be, if not I'll let you all know to save you all wasting your money......like I did...."
1,REALLY BAD,This video was very phony you could tell it was all staged if you want brutal violence go for ultimate street brawls at least thats all real.
4,Faces of Death 3,"This is a great horror documentation, with all real footage of accidents, suicides, and everything else that can go wrong in life, it is a must have for horror/documentary fans everywhere."
1,Nothing more than a damp cloth,It does not worth to spend money on this. It does not do anything other than leaving water marks on the screen.
2,not a very good product,"I wasn't impressed with these cleaning wipes. By the time you add postage, you'd do far better just using standard lens-cleaning wipes you can buy at any discount retailer. These don't even work that well; they tend to create streaks on the computer screen, and don't even do a great job cleaning dust or dirt specks. They're nothing special."
4,Needs a box once opened.,"The wipes do what they are supposed to do- not soggy, no drips, but damp enough to get the job done. The BIG problem is that once the blister pack is opened, there is no place to store the wipes - they're 'loose'. Not happy about that, but the wipes themselves are fine."
3,not that great overall,i purchased this wipes just to complete the $25 cap to get free shipping. the wipes are so wet that they left a water mark on the screen and if there is dust arround you will have your screen even dirty. they clean the screen fine and can be reused one more time if you don't let them dry.
2,Not what I expected. . .,The little towelettes are very convenient except they are pretty dry. I had to use 3 of them to clean my screen effectively.
2,"Gets rid of dust and fingerprints, but leaves a mess","The other two reviewers got it mostly right. But let me make it clear: this lightly moistened wipes can indeed remove fingerprints and dust -- and even prevent dust build-up for a few days. The problem is, when the cleaning liquid dries, it leaves ugly fog-like marks on your LCD screen. I've found out that after it dries, using a lint-free soft cloth to lightly polish the screen helps clean up the screen completely. But then, I could have just used the cloth to remove cust and fingerprints.I think these wipes can be helpful when you have serious fingerprints or dirt (not just dust) on your LCD screen. Otherwise, for most people, this is just a waste of money and can actually make you frustrated."
1,DON'T BUY THESE,"These wipes are horrible. My powerbook had more streaks than you can imagine. Buy the Monster Brand Screen cleaner instead, It is awesome."
3,Pretty Average,"No cfomplaints, really, they work wonderful, but the seem kind of expensive for what they are. I would rate them higher if you got more per package for the same amount of money."
4,Gets the job done,These wipes work just fine. They aren't fancy nor do they need to be. They didn't leave behind a streak or film. I just use them to get dirt and dust off my laptop.
4,Great product - does not dry out and is portable,"I like these wipes because they are individually wrapped and do not dry out. You can easily carry a couple of them with you when you travel as they do not take up any room and hardly weigh anything. They are also a good size. I can use them for my phone, tablet or laptop without problems.I have used the wipes from a tube before. However, they dried out before I had even used a quarter of the total quantity and I had throw them out. They are also not as portable as the individually wrapped wipes."
5,Nice compilation,"This a compilation of articles and interviews with various tennis people. This is a must-read for every fan. The title is misleading, it is not ""today's"" greatest players and matches. There was materials from pre-Open era and a lot of stuff from the '80's. I thought that was fine because I like tennis, but if you are looking for truly current controversies, etc., this isn't it. I would recommend reading it from the library. After you read it, you're done, this is not something you re-read over and over."
3,Good but Repetitive Stories,"As an avid tennis player and reader, I am always looking to for good books on tennis. This book is a compilation of previous interviews and past stories. Many of these are excellent. There is quite a bit of past champions pre-dating my life that were informative. But after initially enjoying the stories, eventually they weaken and become repetitive. I believe this book should be about 2/3 the size it currently is. It is rare I struggle on a subject in which I have great interest. So, while most reviews are quite glowing, just be advised that in my opinion the book is uneven in content and tends to ramble."
5,A Great Find for a Tennis Lover,"Tennis Confidential is collection of articles from 1982 to 2001 that the author has written for various magazines and newspapers. The book gives you a glimpse of the personalities of some of the top players, a summary of the ten greatest matches in tennis history, and a discussion of the changes in tennis in the twentieth century that impinge on the game today. Most important are several excellent chapters devoted to the issues and controversies in present day tennis. Intersperse in the chapters are juicy gossip from the locker room and tennis trivia. The book is a good read. I enjoyed it and I am sure all tennis fans will also. It is highly recommended.A tennis enthusiast"
5,"Essays, interviews, and much more","If you think you know a lot about tennis you'll learn more in this in-depth look at tennis from a long-time, award-winning tennis writer. Paul Fein assembled a collection of his best articles for Tennis Confidential, and the result is an entertaining and informative experience intertwined with fascinating facts. He cleverly broke it down into six parts: Portraits of the Stars, Memorable Interviews, Topical Trends and Burning issues, The Great Controversies, Twentieth-Century Retrospectives, and The Ten Greatest Matches in Tennis History. In one chapter, he examines two-handed backhands, tiebreakers, and the racket revolution. In another, we take an in-depth look at Venus Williams, Andre Agassi, and Anna Kournikova. It's a book that you can pick up again and again and enjoy it all over again. I highly recommend Tennis Confidential to anyone with an interest in tennis."
3,Highland Turbo Tote Hammock,I order two Highland Cargo Nets. They look as advertised and would probably perform as advertised. Design to hold medium to small sized items. Problem area are the fittings used to hold the elastic bands are made of plastic and use friction to hold them in place... which does not work very well. When the elastic bands are stretched they pull out of the fitting that was designed to keep it together. It needs to be a clamp or tie a knot in the band that is larger than the hold method would work better. Amazon no problem ordered and received in less than 5 business days.
4,Delightful,"The poems in this book are meant to be read aloud by two different people. Each person reads one of the two columns aloud and lines written on the same line are said simultaneously. This volume contains poems about birds.My 9 year old son, who doesn't like to read out loud, loves to say these poems with me. It takes a couple of readings to get the cadence right, so this becomes a wonderful way to work on diction while having a tremendous amount of fun."
1,Chewed the tread right off :-(,"Our 1 yr old 18 lb dog (shelter dog, we think maybe Chihuahua + greyhound) chewed through this toy in a few minutes, and that was with the distraction of other new toys. Granted, she is a dedicated chewer but this one went fast even for her. For an average chewer it would probably be fine but it's not ""tire tough."""
1,Useless,"This volume is extremely disappointing: it's little more than a list of sites. For places with which I'm familiar, it was incomplete even when prepared. I returned the book to Amazon."
3,Great Story - OK Book,"I read this book prior to my trip to the Grand Canyon. I am glad that I read it, but found it a tough read. Very repetitive, fair writing at best. Part of the problem is the story itself, while compelling, is about a 100 day raft trip which after the first few easy days is basically day after day of misery. The days and weeks blend together. Perhaps the editors could have figured out a way to make this work better. On the plus side, its an important story to tell about a brave, interesting iconoclastic man who overcame a terrible war wound (the loss of his right arm) to lead one of the great expeditions in American history."
5,A thrilling tale of adventure and adversity,"The history of exploration in America is vast, and most people don't know much about lots of it. This book gives the general reader an intimate and well-written look at the first complete traversing of the Grand Canyon. The writing style is quite breezy, and it makes reading this work easy on the reader. Using diaries and mementos from the participants, the author skillfully weaves an engrossing tale of travail and triumph. He also gives us modern prespectives on river running, to underscore just how difficult this task was, particularly for people unprepared for the hardships and difficulties they were eventually to face. Reading this book lifts the spirit about the couage of those men who braved the unknown in search of something new."
4,Down the Great Unknown,"Great story compiled from the journals of three different explorers on the same trek.The explorers and their personalities, day to day near death experiences, all made for great reading."
3,Down the Great Unknown,"This book was informative but not a real ""page turner"". The author went off on tangents often that took away from the story at hand. It was not a bad book, but it was not full of the adventure that you would have expected the trip to have been."
3,Too Many Analogies,"Good story, adequate writing, fairly interesting. Biggest complaint: the author loaded the text with analogies. He probably used 50 of them. For a 300 page book, that's an analogy every six pages. An occasional analogy can be interesting if presented cleverly. But when an author uses them so often, it can come across as being condescending (and annoying) to the reader. A good editor would have spared us this over-indulgence."
4,Collection of hits from 71-72,"All original hits. The songs on this CD are all wonderful, considering their breadth of style. Song list (since it's not listed):1. Brand New Key - Melanie2. Clean Up Woman - Betty Wright3. Jungle Fever - Chakachas4. Nice To Be With You - Gallery5. Suavecito - Malo6. I Gotcha - Joe Tex7. Hot Rod Lincoln - Commander Cody & Lost Planet Airmen8. Oh Girl - Chi-Lites9. How Do You Do? - Mouth & MacNeal10. Rock Steady - Aretha FranklinThis collection of hit songs is especially interesting. Humor songs are well represented in Hot Rod Lincoln and I Gotcha. Funky, danceable numbers are included in Rock Steady, Clean Up Woman, and the risque Jungle Fever. Oh Girl is a classic soul ballad, whereas the soft Suavecito has a slight Latin flair. Brand New Key and How Do You Do could be described as cutesy, whereas Nice To Be With You is good mainstream pop. Many of these songs are otherwise hard to find. I recommend this CD to anyone who likes great early 70s hit songs."
4,small but pretty,They were smaller than I pictured in my head but they're very pretty and bright. Overall I'm pleased with them.
2,Not as good as their first one,"I loved the experimental, silly, self-titled first record. This one has the band sticking to one sound, which gets tiresome because of their lack of talent. They are taking themselves too seriously here, I hope they go back to the child-like kitchiness of their early, wonderfull work."
4,Good introduction to common stock investing,"Beginning investors looking for a little general direction will enjoy this book by Money Magazine's Wall Street editor. Sivy recommends active asset allocation as your stock strategy. In other words, hold stocks, bonds and other vehicles in general percentage ranges, and adjust according to your view of the economic outlook. Staying within your ranges will prevent disasters when markets turn. His book also covers growth,income, and value investing, and devotes chapters 10-13 to more advanced investing. It's an excellent primer for investors who want to get started in stocks, and also for those who have been primarily in mutual funds but now want to incorporate common stock strategies into their investing. Copyright 1998 by Michael Pellecchia,"
3,A book for someone who is already an investor.,This book is NOT for a beginning investor because a lot of the investment terms and lingo used are for people already familiar with the stock market and how it works.I am a beginning investor and college student who knows very little about making investments. So I am kind of clueless when he talks about mutual funds and price earning ratios. I think when I purchased the book I neglected to carefully understand the title and thought it was a 'rule book' for really *really* beginning investors who have no clue in the world of finance and money.Ignore the 3 star ratings. I just couldnt rate it at all. because I had no clue what i was reading.
5,Fun and exciting,Remember watching this as a kid. Still just as entertaining as before. Don't expect more than a B movie and you will love it.
1,Just horrible,"This movie was awful. The main reason was, it is just too unrealistic. You have ""angels"" played by people like scatman crothers and Charles Durning as well as the Devil played by the now later Oliver Reed coiming into the middle of the scenes and ""fast forwarding"" and ""freezing"".......just not realistic at all. Plus you have travolta as an inventor. Edible sunglasses? Yes I know not all movies have to be 100% realistic but this movie just goes too far. I watched it because Grease was such a great movie but this movie just is pathetic, even compared to an average movie, let alone Grease.On the bright side however, the theme song ""twist of fate"" is one of the best songs of all time and the video is equally awesome. I think I may have just bought the movie to hear the theme song."
1,This Movie Proves Olivia Can't Act,"Olivia should never had made this movie because people really thought she could act. This movie proves she can't. She can't even say one line right. John Travolta is too good of an actor for her. The plot was stupid. Why would angels pick these 2 people as a good reason why the world should be saved? They are a good reason why it shouldn't be saved. Stupid and not even entertaining. Grease was stupid but at least it was somewhat entertaining. Bad plot, bad script, terrible acting by Newton-john. Waste of time and money."
1,What in the name of goodness were they thinking?,"I write this going way back when my dad brought me to the movies as a kid, a huge and excited Olivia fan. But it made me uncomfortable and I emerged not knowing what to make of it all. Watching Olivia in a pseudo-vamp departure from her hitherto sweet and pure was something of a big shock.""Two of a kind"" is akin to a sugar-coated poison pill. A movie not recommended in the least, for its sheer atrocity. After all these years, I still wouldn't see it again.I love Olivia to bits but detest this show to pieces!"
1,Two of a Kind.......avoid at all costs!!,"Ok it was great to see the two main stars reunited, and i was very excited to learn this. But when i saw this movie in the theatre in 1983 i was very dissapointed indeed. This movie lacks everything a movie needs: good direction, good acting and a decent plot. The only thing that saves this low budget little flick is its tacky soundtrack of one hit wonders that made it in the charts for only a brief period of time.Unless you are die hard John Travolta and/or Olivia Newton-John fans then you must avoid this at all costs!!!!!!! Its simply terrible!!Lucinda"
3,John Travolta/ Olvia Newton-john,This wasn't one of their more memorable movies. It's OK but I can't evem remember it enough to write a review of it.
4,Memories with my daughters,My daughters loved Olivia Newton John and John Travolta in Grease just as I did. I want to show them more of my favorites such as Xanadu and Two of a Kind. I remember them being alot of fun to watch. It's a shame they will not re-release it for a new generation to enjoy.
2,"A pleasant diversion, but nothing divine","Before he was the angel ""Michael,"" Travolta was a pawn of God in ""Two of a Kind."" Unfortunately, it's that ridiculous heavenly subplot that wrecks this film. ""Two of a Kind"" would probably have been more fun as just a romance between Travolta and Newton-John because the two leads have a definite appeal. The plot also contains the cliched element of somebody (in this case, the police) trying to drive the lovers apart by telling each of them lies about the other. The film does have some intentionally humorous and cute moments such as Travolta's mustache disguise coming off while he's robbing the bank where Newton-John is a teller and an angel telling God to ""bless himself"" after he sneezes . You can also snicker at unintentional fun present in how much the costume makes him look like James Young of the rock group Styx. And JUST TRY not breaking into song when the cop asks Travolta ""You want to stay alive?"""
4,If you love Livvy.....,"Ok, so this movie was a flop...story is kind of silly, but if you LOVE ONJ like I do, you will enjoy this! Livvy is beautiful as always in this movie and her music was great too!Yeah, I agree with the other reviews, it is a ""Hall of Shamer"" but, us die-hard ONJ fans still like watching her!"
3,Have to have an open mind about it,"Well, I admit, hearing Olivia Newton-John swear for the first time made me uncomfortable, but aside from that, the movie was not terrible. Olivia is really a great actress! She and John Travolta really did well together in this film. This movie really has a great soundtrack, too."
4,Love it!,"I can't help but love this movie. I was in love with John Travolta as a kid and Olivia Newton-John was my idol. So, as cheesy as this movie is, I still can't help but love it. Also, if you think about it, the story is a very good one with a great moral."
5,"If you have Grease, Xanadu then...","you must have this movie as well! Olivia and John come together once again in different roles, and the music is superb of course! Twist of Fate, yes I know the words by heart! This movie has comedy and love which this would be a great addition to any movie collection. Don't hesitate with that mouse, buy it, you'll be glad that you did."
4,"Great film,but not a hit","I thought this movie was a great idea,about changing your mistakes,but this film just didn't make it.I think everyone wanted Grease 2 instead."
4,Kept you guessing,This was an awesome suspense filled read. The author took you to the projects literally. I love books that are hard to figure out and this was one of those reads. Without giving to much away I will have to say that If you love suspense this is a good book to read. It will have u at the edge of your seat and wanting to blame everyone for a murder when truly you have no idea if one even really occurred. I truly enjoy it!!
4,Maylene EyeCU Book Club,This book is full of twist and turns. Definitely keeps you turning pages. I really enjoyed how when I thought i knew what would take place next here came a new twist. I also enjoyed how the author pulled you in and put you right there amongst the time and place.This book is sure to make your bells and whistles go off.
4,THE BRIDGE,"I really enjoyed this book. The story contained not only action but there was a who-dun-it plot as well. I found myself glued to the pages in a search of the answer as to who was the culprit. If this second addition to the novel industry is any indication of what we can expect in the future from Solomon then we can only look forward to it getting better. Thanks Solomon, I love it when a book has me so intrigued that I can't put it down no matter how much my eyes burn for sleep. I'll be looking forward to your next publication."
4,Authentic Urban Murder Mystery,"The streets, the characters, the excitement, the anguish...the story is real... Several weeks after finishing the book, (which was impossible to put down...) I'm still thinking about that little girl and her f-ed up family with no way out. This guy can write. Buy this book!! And buy Pipe Dreams. Whew! A crack love story. Made me cry."
5,THIS BOOK WAS HARD TO PUT DOWN!,This book was hard to put down i read it in about 3 days off and on. This was the first time i read a book by Solomon Jones and it aint gone be the last. I recently bought Ride or Die by Solomon and Pipedream by Solomon and I cant wait to read them. I highly recommend this book to people that enjoy street tales this book is for you! This book has you wondering whats going to happen next. Its Wonderful!!!!!
4,Good reading....with a twist to the ending,"Compared to some of the other ""johnny come lately"" books about drug dealers and users, The Bridge does not glorify the life of the dealer while condemning those dependant on him....it shows how ruthless people can be, yet still shows that somehow through the ruthlessness, they still have feelings like the next person....Solomon Jones portrays his characters feelings and emotions realistically to the point where I found myself feeling sorry for the characters I disliked. In terms of writing style, Jones has a way of making the story continue without making it seem like it is being dragged out...hopefully there is another book about Kevin Lynch....his story is not finished yet."
5,solomon jones did once again,"This book is so damn good!!! Thats sums it all up. If you are thinking about getting this book, let me be your reassurement...buy it!!! And make sure you get The Bridge right along with Pipe Dream if you didn't read that yet. Solomon Jones is an expectionally talented author. I read Pipe Dream in a day and a half. I could put the bridge down read in 7 hours(no exaggeration). It was such a page turner I couldn't put it down until i found out the ending. Trust me you'll love it!!!! I can't wait to get his next book"
5,Strong Second Effort,"Solomon Jones introduced us to the streets of Philadelphia in his first novel, Pipe Dream. In his fast-paced second novel, The Bridge, he introduces us to the people. The mystery revolves around the disappearance of a child, but the story is about much more than that. The Bridge is about relationships. A long-buried love interest between the married Detective Lynch and the drug-addled Daneen reemerges. A disastrous affair has all but destroyed the lives of two other characters. A twisted love connection drives the actions of two more. And in the midst of the drama, an investigation reveals the shameful secrets behind it all. Jones spins a great story while addressing issues of love, betrayal and revenge. All told, The Bridge, Jones's strong second effort, is even better than his first novel, Pipe Dream."
4,"Nothing is as seems in ""The Bridge""","A suspenseful, unpredictable and mind boggling read of who dun what, when, where and how! From the very beginning, I was enthralled in every page of the emotional roller coaster of ""The Bridge"". With a family full of dirty secrets, greed and lies.... Nothing is as it seems living in ""The Bridge"". Each chapter pulled me in a lil deeper, taunting and tugging at my heart strings. I found myself holding on to hope, not able 2 rest until I learned the fate of lil Kenya.Ebony EyeCU Reading & Social Network"
3,A French 'Hannah & Her Sisters',"This little known but charming movie is an ensemble piece and very French in its eccentric characters, twists, turns and coincidences. We see sibling rivalry and friction, but the story tells us that we may not know the people most close to us and that life can be constantly surprising. Another surprise is to see these accomplished actresses play against type."
4,GREAT ADDITION FOR U.S. FANS COLLECTIONS!,"It's been said before and it will be said again, but it's about time Sony bothered to throw U.S. Suede fans a long deserved bone with the release of this CD. If they were any smarter, they'd do this more often as Suede puts out excellent B-sides that are unjustly ignored outside of their native U.K. While this compilation could've used more B-sides and less (a tad unnecessary, if I may say so) remixes of the title tune. But oh well, I guess we Yanks can't complain...(but we should! ) The 3 b-sides are prime examples of what Suede does best. slow, mid, and fast. Buy it today!"
3,flap,"great movie enjoyed it immensely stellar performances by anthony quinn, shelly winters and claude akins quite a good parody of the sixties"
3,Flap,This was what you call a big flop! The only reason why I purchase the cd was it was filmed in the area I come from and recognized most of the individuals that played extras
5,Great,"After looking in other places for ""FLAP"", I found it at Amazon. It was as I remembered it. Thanks I recommend Amazon."
5,Quality Resource,I ranked it five stars because it is a quality resource that ties many other Scriptures into the study of Revelation. John does a very good job in both books of this series.I would recommend it to anyone studying Revelation or trying to get a more clear picture of what it all means.
4,"Great novel, especially for any women!","Was reccommended this novel by a friend, and I actually liked it a lot. Great story about a women going through mid-life crisis and how she is dealing with it by basically going back to her old house and helping her mom pack up and sell the place."
5,I believe this book acheives it 's purpose!,"Entertainment... while not knowing entirely what to make of it swallowing my preconceptions gave way to bewilderment and wonder.. There remain many phenomina that sceintific knowledge will never explain. the natural world, the moon, emtions, and sound have many unexamined effects on plants and us. this book explores them all! Purhaps that is what makes the human quest ever scoping new horizons most exiting and meaningful... I went on to read all the biobliograghical citations of interest I could find in libraries. I realized my veiw into this books studies was a drop in the pool.. Many of the reference were old but classic nonetheless. The only reason modern sceince has not delved deeper into the works of these men is there has been of yet no practical way to make money off it! I wholeheartedly recomend this book"
5,You will never see the world the same way again.,"The title is misleading -there's only a chapter ortwo about soil.Leans a bit towardsagriculture, but you get thebig picture of theenvironment as a whole.Ever heard about globalfreezing winters, hottersummers, desertification,tornadoes,earthquakes too, and younever imagined WE createdthem! Very eye-opening.you realize the state theworld is in. Might also makeyou go off your food (--you'llknow when you read it).An 'absolutely must-have'"
2,SOS review,"This book is way over the top for the average gardener. It is more philosophy, religion and agenda driven than I expected. I overlooked the subtitle ""New solutions for restoring our planet"" when I bought the book, therefore I can not complain that the book is not what I expected. I was disappointed to say the least."
1,"Do you believe in ""etheric formative forces"" ?","This is total BS. Absolutely nothing grounded in reality. These people or completely mad. Unless you believe in magic and hocus pocus, stay away. Scary!!!"
1,"Oh, yea...","...I remember this game! I had it on Sega CD (16-bit). Thought it was the coolest thing at the time; interact with an actual movie.Then I played the 3DO version at a friend's house and felt sorely gipped. The video was almost full screen, smoother, and there wasn't a large wait between rooms.Then this 32X version was released. It was both a blessing and a curse, here's why:GOOD: The video is clearer then the Sega CD version, it has a larger video screen, a pause feature, the on-screen text is legible, it's possible to see what the room buttons are supposed to be, and the audio can actually be deciphered.BAD: There are frequent load times during videos, video screen is not as large as 3DO's, and load times inbetween rooms/failed tasks are almost unbearable--especially before something actually happens.The long and short of it is that I played this 32X-CD version once, then returned to my old Sega CD version for subsequent plays."
3,"simple, but fun","Eh, NIGHT TRAP is not that good of a game. It's not really controversial either. I'm not sure why everyone was ""up in arms"" over this one. NIGHT TRAP was just scrutinized because it was the first. ('first' is debatable) This is a harmless game. It contains pretty bad video quality, but it's interactive. (If it weren't for this game, we wouldn't have the ESRB.)Your goal is simple: trap the alien invaders, protect the girls at the slumber party.At the time of release, the players' ""control"" over the game's content was considered revolutionary. NIGHT TRAP is not that big of a deal. Full motion video (FMV) games have always been heavily criticized This is not even that good of an FMV game. NIGHT TRAP is about as titillating as a department store catalog. Plenty of 1980's style and humor string the thin plot along.Final thought: simple, but fun."
2,MAT review,"Not really all that useful, Kaplan, Barron's and REA guides are better. Acceptable for a quick skim and the practice tests. The exam is difficult, pace yourself carefully and you will probably do better than you think."
3,A good read in an Excellent Series by a Great Author,"The Dirty Duck, by Martha Grimes, is the 4th book in this excellent series. This is not the strongest entry in the series, but it is still a quick and engaging read; a journey well-worth taking. The setting here is Stratford - Upon - Avon during a Shakespearian festival. For those of you new to the series, I would recommend reading them in order for the best reading experience; however, they are also fun as stand alone novels.Here is the series in order:The Man with a Load of MischiefThe Old Fox DeceivedThe Anodyne NecklaceThe Dirty DuckJerusalem InnHelp the Poor StrugglerThe Deer LeapI am the only Running FootmanThe Five Bells and BladeboneThe Old SilentThe Old ContemptiblesThe Horse You Came In onRainbow's EndThe Case has AlteredThe StargazeyThe Lamorna WinkThe Blue LastThe Grave MauriceThe Winds of ChangeThe Old Wine ShadesDust"
2,Witty but not well plotted,"This is the first book by Martha Grimes I have read, after a couple of friends recommended her. She has a witty style and is obviously well-read (references to Shakespeare and the Elizabethan world play an important role in the book). Unfotunately the denouement, contrary to a reviewer's blurb on the back cover, is not well conceived and is resolved with the help of a deus ex machina-character flown into England on a Concorde jet liner (really). The main characters, Richard Jury and Melrose Plant, are likable; this book may just be a weak entry in the series."
3,Not as Good as the Others in this Wonderful Series,"I am puzzled by Martha Grimes' response to Americans in this novel. As an American, albeit one who is writing British mysteries, she comes up with a whole tour full of unsympathetic American tourists here--even down to what I think are supposed to be humerous names for them. I think this is unfortunate, since it weakens the book, which has a plot that could have held up just as well if the characters were less insistantly annoying.Martha Grimes is one of my favorite writers, and I don't think this novel holds up anywhere near as well as the others in this wonderful series."
4,A good debut...,"It's a shame that this cd never got released. Lovher's debut is actually a good album. I'm glad that Sisqo never made any guest appearances on any of the songs. (It would've just ruined it.) Some of my fav's from the album: How It's Gonna Be, Love, You Don't Me and Commitment.If you can find this to download definitely add it to your collection."
3,SISQO GIRL GROUP,THE UNRELEASED DEBUT 2 KNOW HER IS 2 LOVHER ON DEF SOUL RECORDS BY SISQO GIRL QUARTET WASN'T A HOT CD IN ALL REALITY I SEE WHY THE LABEL DEJ SOUL MADE THE DECISON 2 SHELVE THE CD. BECAUSE HAVIN SISQO AS A MENTOR YOU WOULD ASSUME THE CD WOULD BE A MILLION SELLER LIKE DRU HILL. BUT NO THE CD OVERALL ISN'T THAT GREAT BUT THE SONGS ARE OKAY . BY THEM BEIN THE FIRST ARTIST SIGN ON DEF SOUL THEIR DEBUT COULD'VE BEEN MORE APPEALIN AND I DON'T THINK THE CD WOULD'VE REALLY SOLD THAT MUCH . NO APPEARANCES BUT SISQO AND THE HIT SONG HOW IT'S GONNA BE MADE SOME NOISE BUT THE DEBUT SHOULD'VE GOT REWORK AND RELEASE CAUSE NOW IT'S BEEN 5 YRS AND LOVHER DISAPPEARED SO THIS ALBUM WILL NEVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY
5,fun! fun! fun!,"Kiddie rock or clown time? With Jonathan it's a little bit of both. A hard to find recording that is, without a doubt, an example of Jonathan Richman at his zaniest. It may be too corny for some, or a little over the top for others, but if you're tired of pretentious twaddle get BACK IN YOUR LIFE, and get happy."
4,Focus is on past dated conflicts.,"Contents were interesting and some details were already known from other authors. The analysis on some facts appeared to be dragged out to compliment book depth more so than material insight. After the author identifies the means of measure and demonstrates some conflicts to show results. The book does speed up in informing the reader of commonalities by traits that have been identified in the past and in newer examples. The perspective of operations is very interesting in relation to the planning and execution of surprises in war. The entire book is interesting with plenty of sources to validate information and to acquire more depth in issues of interests for further study. To answer that annoying question, yes it does read similar to a course book, so no thrills or explosive facts to leave you astonished of the environmental conditions or the changing theater of game theory. But it is a very good source on establishing fact and a basis for future research."
3,"The last on ""Toby Dammit"" is a short in itself","The first two in the detached trilogy are forgettable but the last one directed by Fellini is a classic, at first I thought it was Terrance Stamp and then I found out it was and I like him even more now. His performance is classic and the short is actually quite creepy rendition of Poe's ""Don't lose you head"" If I was a film student I would pay attention to this one. Hey Jane Fonda was pretty cute in her time, nevertheless the short with her was pretty bad and kind of dull, the second one was better though. Overall: good late night fright film with Fellini saving this film."
3,This is one of the few titles I actually think is improved when dubbed.,"The reason? The final episode from Fellini which cheats Terence Stamp out of his own voice...Much as I love this movie, it is significantly marred by this...(Same as with Mario Bava's BLACK SABBATH which cheats Boris Karloff out of his voice in the subtitled version)."
3,INTERESTING STORIES HARD TO EXPLAIN,"Three different storylines in one movie In the first story Jane & Peter Fonda play lovers when one dies the other begin to have a passion towards horses, this story didn`t intrest me a bit. But famous french star Alain Delon who plays William Willson(the best story of the three)a renagade Australian Soilder who has gone crazy because he is haunted by an exact duplicate of himself everytime he commits a vile act. The last story in this strange and offbeat trilogy Is called Toby Dammit,played by Terence Stamp a reckless film star at the end of his rope accepts a deadly bet if he can survive a car crash of some sort. Confusing but yet enjoyable as long you don`t think about it too much. This is certainly a film of the 60`s no chance nowaydays to pull off a film of this strange & obsuere subjects."
3,"Poor stories, bad filming","Boring and stupid rendition of Poe stories. The only acceptable one is by Fellini, but it also shows the vacuity of the time when it was shot and is not a work of art. Fot the other stories the only point of interest is about a very young Brigitte Bardot's partial nudity."
2,Butchered Masterwork,"As originally conceived by Fellini, the Toby Dammitt segment was, imho, the greatest work he ever committed to film. Taut, lean, stylish and very effective. I saw the film when it was first released and am fortunate enough to have this segment on an old beta tape.Beyond Terrence Stamp's wonderful delivery, is the crucial element of the english actor being alone and isolated in Italy by his language, slowly pushing him deeper into surrender and madness. All of this is lost in the current French dubbed edition.(On the other hand, it must be a plus to have the first two segments, overdubbed into English for US release, back to their original French. However, these segments are competent, or somewhat interesting at best, compared to fantastic finale.)Please let Janus know that they have broken trust by butchering a great artist's masterwork."
4,The best is last,"Spirits of the dead is a mixed bag of cinematic delight. Of the 3 episodes, only the last one ""Toby Dammit"" sustains interest. Fellini is at his best in this segment & Terence Stamp puts in a self destructive performance that has to be seen to be believed! His character, a self destructing actor who has reached the end of all worldly hope & desire wants only to leap into the chasm of death & destruction & he does so in spectactular fashion. This segment alone is worth the price of admission & Fellini caries the weight of the entire film on his capable talents. Images to delight & dialogue to astound, Terence Stamp should have won some kind of award for this brilliant performance as he portrays a burnt out actor with a death wish. You can't help but sympathize with him as he jolts his way from one bizarre interlude to another. You know you're at deaths door when you can turn down that blonde in the awards segment! Yikes!!! Never bet the devil your head!! See it!"
3,FORMULAIC BUT WATCHABLE COP THRILLER,"Clint Eastwood and Charlie Sheen make strange co-cops, the chemistry was there but not quite. The Rookie is full of formula action cliches with plot holes so large you could drive a stolen SUV through them. The saving grace: a funny grizzled performance by Clint Eastwood. If you can digest the first 15 minutes and not think too hard about it, ""The Rookie"" is actually quite a watchable movie with some pretty nifty explosions, escapes and chases. You know, the works."
2,Clint's Dead End,"By 1990, Clint Eastwood was reeling from a string of box-office disappointments that mirrored the career downturn of his friend Burt Reynolds. ""The Rookie"" represented Eastwood's last foray into the formulaic cop thriller and, from a directorial standpoint, one of his weakest efforts. Even today, it's painful to see Clint teamed with Charlie Sheen for the sake of commercial desperation. Apart from some impressive stunt work - not to mention the bizarre casting of Raul Julia and Sonia Braga as German villains - the film evaporates from memory. Luckily for Eastwood, the Oscar-winning ""Unforgiven"" was just around the corner."
4,Very good movie....,"Well, it seem's that some here didn't like it..I thought I had seen this movie because of the title..but indeed, I had not. It got my attention at once...and I watched it all the way thru. The only time I left the movie was durning the commericals. It kinda reminds you of a Dirty Harry movie..so I guess that is why I liked it so much. Charlie Sheen did a pretty good job, but maybe someone else would have been better suited to play that part. I think becasue I have only seen him in a comic roll,may be the reason I was not that keen about him playing that part. All in all, I still liked it very much and I am glad I had a chance to see the film.<>Lon<>"
5,Very good older movie.,this is a very good movie with two big strars that make the movie. I got a very good deal.
3,WHAT A COMBO!,"The plot and action have been covered in other reviews - but what struck me was the weird combination of Clint, a tough cop/cowboy in most movies, while co-starring Charlie, typically a buffoon and a comedy guy. I like both guys in the movies, but working together seemed off-base and not real. Even Clint's directing talents couldn't bring this one out of the fire. It's entertainment, not the best, but worth a look on how not to combine certain talents."
3,Eastwood on automatic pilot but...,"Clint Eastwood on automatic pilot is a lot better than some peoples best films, so make no mistake this may be the worst film ever that he directed himself but its still pretty good. In fact for me it would have been 3.5 stars.Its really a Dirty Harry film under another name, and with a decent cast including the always watchable Charlie Sheen its an easy way to pass an hour and a half. There are a couple of laugh out loud moments, especially the seat belt gag.Of course the reason to watch the film is the man himself. Aged 61 when this was made he was still in top shape and is effortlessly cool throughout the film. Some of the dialogue isn't as good as that in the classic Dirty Harry films but there's still enough laconic lines for the Eastwood fan to get by on.So its no classic by Eastwood standards, but as comedy/cop/thrillers go, which also happens to star a living legend, its a dam sight better than you might expect given it rather poor reputation."
4,Very good,"I remember seeing this since I was little. And now, around 2 decades later, I saw it again. I liked it, I enjoyed it, better yet, it was awesome. Get well, Charlie. RIP Raul"
5,The Rookie,I really enjoy having and watching classic movies like this one. The younger generation doesn't even remember it. It is a keeper.
1,"Oh, my word.","This exquisitely disastrous outing teams bright-eyed Charlie Sheen with hardbitten Clint Eastwood in a buddy-buddy cop movie that will leave you rolling on the floor. No cliche of the genre is ignored, right down to Raul Julia's camp villian and his psychopatic sidekick in the shapely form of Sonia Braga. The plot - such as it is - is hardly relevant. Far more entertaining are the exchanges between our idealistic young turk and his careworn mentor. The only highpoint is an hilarious sexual advance by Braga on a bound and captured Eastwood in what may well be sufficient material for an entirely separate project called, say, 'Senior Citizens - Down and Dirty'. Atrocious, in every way, but so bad it achieves a mesmerizing, comic brilliance."
3,PRETTY STANDARD FARE,"THE ROOKIE might have been better had it been about twenty minutes shorter. Director and star Clint Eastwood who usually keeps his action movies a little livelier allows the story to slow down with inexplicably unnecessary scenes and an extended climax that become tedious rather than exhilarating. Charlie Sheen does a decent job as the titular rookie, whose guilt over the death of his brother handicaps his performance as a cop. Lara Flynn Boyle does well with an underdeveloped role as Sheen's live-in girlfriend. Raul Julia and Sonia Braga are horribly miscast as Germans (?) but admittedly Braga is a seminally effective bitch villainess whose ""rape"" of Eastwood is something one doesn't expect from Dirty Harry. The trivia for the movie boasts that the movie had twice as many stuntmen as actors and one can see why---there are a lot of high fallutin action sequences but they don't come often enough to save the movie's otherwise tepid pacing. Not one of Eastwood's finer moments."
1,not real sure why clint made this mess,"clint and charlie sheen are not a very good pair in clints missfire of and action movie.clint is the old cop,charlie is the new(surprise) and they are hunting car jackers in this sad little action movie. clint is off screen as much as he is on screen,and sheen just can't carry a movie like this himself. really just a waste of time."
2,"Rent another Clint flic, but not Play Misty for Me","It is obvious from watching the film that Charlie Sheen's drug habit is adversely affecting his acting abilities. The budding actor from Platoon is nowhere to be found in the Rookie. At the same time Clint's career and personal life were at a cross roads. He wasn't the box office hit as he was just a few years earlier with his ""which way"" movies, nor was he in his Dirty Harry or Western element. In addition Clint and his late 70's, early 80's movie partner, Sandra Locke were breaking up. Lastly, the dialogue does not have any of the Eastwoodesque one liners that differentiated his westerns from other westerns and defined the Dirty Harry series. Therefore, it gets 2 stars because Clint makes an appearance, but no more due to the poor acting by the lead men and the less than inciteful script."
2,Disapointing Shaver,"The Braun 340 does not shave as close as my Remington 407 and takes longer to shave. The right angle trimmer on the Remington is a better design. The huge plug on the cord could be a nuisance when traveling. After a month in using the 340, I am very disappointed in using this shaver. George S."
1,I wish there was a 1/2 star rating,"This is the absolute worst shaver I have ever owned. It all started when my wife wanted to do me a favor and buy me a new razor, she typically buys products with elevated price tags because she wants the ""best"" for me, bless her heart. This shaver isn't even good enough to cut peach fuzz on a 14-year-old. If you normally shave every day it's a challenge to use, if you go two or three days you will be standing at the mirror for 30 minutes. I don't know what it is about the foil design, I have never had to rub my face raw just to go after a few hairs that seem to elude the cutting blades. I spend more time trying to get a full cut, using every 3-dimensional angle in space, and I'm constantly charging this thing (oh, by the way, you can't cut when it's charging - safety deal I'm sure). I will never own a Braun product again. DO NOT BUY THIS SHAVER."
1,Broke after 4 months of use,"My hubby was super pleased with this shaver until one day the mechanism just stopped working. Going to have to look for parts for it, or see whether its cheaper just to buy a whole new shaver. Not too pleased, paid around $84 for it with tax and not happy at all that it broke in just 4 months."
1,Not the shaver I expected,"I received the first Series 3 shaver as a gift. It worked OK for about 6 months then it failed (would not turn on). I bought a replacement and it, too, lasted about 6 months before failing (it will not recharge). To get a decent shave, I had to repeatedly go over my beard, testing constantly to see if any stubble remained. I sustained several razor burns on my neck from applying too much pressure trying to get the job done faster. My old Norelco did a better job in less time, but it also had some issues with quality (three repairs in two years). I will not buy another Braun shaver."
4,Good Price,"The price for this exact model (same packaging etc etc) is $69 at Walmart and Target.Although price here seems to have gone up, it is still far cheaper.Bought for my dad who has been a lifetime blade user and can't use blades to shave anymore(anticoagulant medication), he thinks it does a pretty good job."
4,Braun 4775,"I purchased this razor for my son who is 22 yrs old. He says he loves it and ""it doesn't chew up my face like the old one"". So, I guess that means it's a good razor."
3,"Low priced Braun, limited features.","On the one hand it is quieter than my old Braun, and seems to take the 7000 series screen and blade, on the other hand the head doesn't tilt and battery life seems shorter."
4,Great Value,This is the finest razor I have ever used. Far better then the tripleheaded system Norelco touts. Which I think is way overrated. Try to shave under your nose with this. While not as close as a blade (what is)this isperfect for those times you don't have to go cheek to cheek with someone.
2,Disappointed,"I have used four Norelcos over many decades. Rather than buying new cutters for two year old shaver, time to try Braun. I have used new Series 3/340 for three weeks now. Smooth but NOT close; particularly on neck. Leaves too much stubble. I do not particularly like these little buzzing/vibrating razors but I suppose I would get used to that. Contrarily, Norelco feels like it has small balanced electric motor in comparison. To get a close shave I find I have to go back and RESHAVE with Norelco. Not good! Norelco trimmer is vastly superior to Braun's. I have sixty days in which to return. I will put up with it for another week or so and then return it if shaves don't get anywhere as close as they did with all my previous Norelcos. Not a bad product. Just mediocre results, but that does not make a nice, clean shave. I am disappointed. Expected more. I do love the ability to rinse with water after shaving though."
3,Braun Series 3 340 Men's Shaver,"It is good but still we have to spend little more time to do shaving. It looks good and Amazon is doing good to send the product ontime.RameshBloomington, IL"
1,Worst Shaver Ever,I purchased this Shaver to replace an old Remington that gave me excellent service for many years until the battery just wore out. The Braun Series 3 340 is horrible. It is noisy for sure but that is only a minor inconvenience. It takes 10 minutes or more to shave and it still leaves fine hair and stubble all over my face. The only way I can shave is under a bright light or I will leave stubble even tough I have passed over it several times. I can never get a clean shave. If you purchase this shaver you will have thrown away your money. I certainly did and I am now searching for another replacement.
1,Worst Shaver Ever,"I had a Panasonic Wet Dry and I really liked it. However it was dropped and a piece broke off. Decided to buy a new one but when I went to the store they were sold out. Saw some Braun 4700 series, and decided to give one a try as you are lead to believe they are the best. It is really bad.... no power, does not shave clean... I have nothing good to say about it.Got a Panasonic Wet/Dry ES7103 a few days ago as a replacement, and I am a happy camper with my shaver once again."
2,not impressed,"i have owned Braun shavers in the past, that i liked very much. The 340 is not an outstanding poduct. I think my 4 year Remington is superior in performance.i intend to retun it for a refund."
1,Hate it,I hate this shaver. I have had it for about 6 months thinking maybe I had to get used to it but this shaver is a waste of money.
2,THE RAZOR THAT DOESN'T CUT IT,"Over the past twenty years I have owned at least 6 Braun electric razors. All past Braun razors worked fine so I had the expectation that the recently purchased Braun razor would be satisfactory -- but it is not! Either I got a lemon or Braun has lowered its manufacturing standards on their lower priced electric razors.Problems: (1) my beard is not heavy, but it takes twice as long to shave as it did with my former Braun razor; (2) Moreover, the shave is unacceptable since the result of this Braun shave is a remaining rather rough, not smooth, beard. Repeated shaving over many areas do not do the job removing the stubble, particularly with respect to short hairs;(3) The side cutter is a ""menace"" -- I have drawn blood twice trying to use it; and (4) The razor did not come with a plastic ""guard"" over the cutter as all Braun razors did in my past experiences.In summary, this Braun razor is a disappointment and I regret its purchase.Dr. Stephen E. Goldston"
1,Disappointing,It doesn't shave very close at all and misses a lot of hair. I have to go over my face 4 or 5 times. And the trimmer is useless: it does not cut.
4,No frills but smooth shave,"Have been using the Braun Series 3 340 Men's Shaver for a weeks now; Initially skeptical about it after reading some of the reviews -But thoroughly satisfied with the smooth and seamless shave+ Super quick charge time and retention capacity of the battery+ Seamless shave leaving the skin smooth and without razor bumps+ Easy to clean and maintain- Takes some getting used to, especially if you are switching from a regular razor- Leaves some traces of hair in the neck which even after a lot of effort was difficult to shave - had to bring out my Gillette to get the job done =)For best results use with Williams Lectric Pre-shave and finish up with a Neutrogena Post shave lotion!"
4,Little Sister Review,"I thought that Little Sister was the best book I've read this year and I liked it a lot. Despite a slow start, the author (Kara Dalkey) picks up the pace quickly when the main character (Mitsuko) starts on a journey to find her sister's (Amaiko) lost soul through heaven and hell being guided by a friendly demon (Goranu). On their journey they go through the Land of the Ancestors and the author describes the setting tremendously. However, some of the parts were pretty randomly placed in the book; this reminded of the tornado scene in the Wizard of Oz when strange things are just flying by. Why I say this is because the author could keep Mitsuko traveling through Lord Emma-o's hell but the scene just stops and she appears somewhere else. Despite these minor flaws, Little Sister was a great book that is quick and hard to stop reading because of the wisely placed cliffhangers and interesting plot."
4,I really liked this book,"I enjoyed the book Little Sister, and beive it was the best book this year. The beginning was a little slow, but i really got into it during the rest. The authour did a really good job of developing Mitsuko, character, but didnt really develop anyone else. The ending was very abrupt and had no warning of what was going to happen. When Goranu wanted to marry Mitsuko, it was a big blow in your train of thought. Ifi was the author i would have choosen a different ending, i didnt dislike the ending, but it wasnt the best. The book was not only fiction, but had fact too. It showed how it would be to be a noble woman, and how you would have to treat people of lower class than you. Though most of the characters were fictional they were still educational, like when Mitsuko became more spontanuous she was no longer considered a lady by her sister Amaiko. Over all the book was very good."
2,Trevinator's Review o Little Sister,"I think Little Sister was one of the better books of this year, but however it is not as a Discworld book. It slightly made up for all the stress of warlords by giving us an easy to read adventure of feudal Japan. It was a bit gloomy in its storyline because death could be found at the turn of a page throughout the book. My favorite character was Goranu because he not unlike myself is a trickster and sarcastic at times. overall it was an okay book. the only way i would improve it would be to give it more of an ending instead of leaving the reader hanging."
3,Little Sister,Little Sister was an overall average book. I thought the plot was strange because Goraun lead little puddle on a trip through the underworld and all over Japan and almost got killed just so that her sister could stop morning. The way the author wrote the ending was strange by abruptly ending the book saying you could think whatever you wanted about what would happen next. I liked how it talked about all the different lands that Little puddle traveled to and the description used when talking about the land of the dead and mount Fuji. I also like all the mythical creatures it talked about and how it used Japan's mythology.
4,An wonderful Japanese story of adventure.,"""Little Sister"" is a story about a young Japanese girl who runs away from her highly honorable family to save her talented, beautiful, and newly widowed sister. As she travels with her new demon aquaintance on a mission to save her sister's soul, Mistuko will encounter many powerful beings and will win you over with her wonderful story of adventure and determination written in her own words. I personaly thought this story was very engaging and was a very, very good story."
5,It's Everly Time,This is The Everly Brothers at their best. Sleepless Nights has got to be the most beautiful love song they've recorded.
3,Corny but entertaining,"The writing in ""The Loving Daylights"" is not as adept in Lynsay Sands' contemporary vampire novels. I realize that this book is a spoof of a spoof (James Bond movies), but I rolled my eyes a few times at the handy gadgets that the heroine just happened to have on-hand. As an engineer I'll probably keep this book on my shelf just because there are so few books in this genre that feature women inventors."
3,Hmmm...,"I dont really know how else to describe how I felt about this book. The story line was not very strong and the characters were okay... nothing special. If anything, Sands tries too hard to make a mediocre plot into a James Bond like story, BUT... this is the funniest book I have read in a long time. I laughed until I just about bust a gut! The situations that the characters get into are incredibly funny. The inventions are beyond belief! If you want a good story, read something else, but if you want to laugh yourself silly, this book is for you!"
2,Lynsay! Really??,"Lynsay Sands has a tendency to be a rather light, silly read, but this is ridiculous. Boring and unlikely plot. She has finally moved off my ""be sure to read list"" with this one."
2,Yawn-birds,"Legendary guitarists served their apprenticeship in the YARDBIRDS- this we know. Yet for all that, the band was decidedly indistinguishable from the countless others that vied for the record buyer's shillings in the mid-60s. The Yardbirds sound was cookie cutter generic Brit blues-rock, and except for a few middling singles and some musicians who went on to better things, this quintet without a decent voice among them would have been forgotten long ago.TOTAL PLAYING TIME -- 26:35"
2,this is only a teaser,there's not enough songs on this cd. but is inexpensive and included some of their best known songs
2,nice concept but it doesn't work,"I pack my lunch to take to work every day and have several lunc containers that I use, including another Fit & Fresh product. I've used this item twice and will probably never use it again. The ice gel ring is very small and melts almost immediately. The food in the cold compartment does not stay cold (or even cool) and the soup container is not really insulated at all, so that gets cold.It's a nice concept but just doesn't work. If you have the equipment to reheat your soup and don't pack anything in the bottom that actually needs to stay cool/cold, then this is an okay way to transport your lunch. Just don't expect a steaming bowl of soup and a crisp salad when it's time to eat."
1,Concept great in theory...,"I purchased this for my child for school with the intent of havng her eat great homemade meals instead of processed school lunches. The ice ring pack cracked open in the freezer and was useless the first day I tried to use it. The idea is great in theory, but the product is garbage."
4,Could be better,"I bought this for the convenience but I found that by the time lunch came around the soup was cold due to the freeze ring sitting just underneath. That wouldn't be all that bad except about two months into using the freeze ring it started to crack at one of the inside seams and would leak blue liquid on top of the white holder it sat in after it defrosted (usually about the time I went to lunch). It never touched the food that I know of, but I threw the freeze ring away because I couldn't figure out a way to fix it. I haven't ordered a new freeze ring yet, so I don't use the bottom portion anymore. The top bowl I still use all the time for soups and hot breakfast like cream of wheat and oatmeal. I probably just got a bad freeze ring."
3,A formulaic but engaging murder mystery,"In this engaging giallo directed by Aldo Lado, George Lazenby plays Franco Serpieri, a well-known Venetian sculptor. After Serpieri's young daughter is murdered, he grows impatient with the efforts of the police and tries to find the killer himself, with some help from his estranged wife (Strindberg). The film sticks to a familiar formula: the likely suspects are killed off one by one, and the last man (or woman) standing is revealed as the murderer. But the process feels clumsier than it ought to here, and since the killer turns out to be one of the film's least developed characters, the ending is less than satisfying. Fortunately, though, painterly cinematography and an intriguing score by the brilliant Ennio Morricone help compensate for the weaknesses of the script. Recommended.Three stars out of five."
2,"Buy ""Don't Look Now"" on DVD instead!","I am a fan of almost any film made in Venice. Since I was familiar with the '72 Classic ""Don't Look Now"" starring Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie, I came across this film which was supposed to have inspired ""Don't Look Now"". Well, save your money and ""don't watch"" this! It has some nice shots of Venice in the 1970's, however, the story is slow and weak, the murders are tame, most importantly, the sex scenes are PG-13 by today's standards!...I can't find a good enough reason to recommend it. I expected ""Italian erotica"" mixed in with some tension and suspense....there is very little of either in this yarn.Buy ""Don't Look Now"" and watch Sutherland banging Julie Christie silly, when you aren't being scared out of your socks by a short person in a red coat, murdering people in Venice! Its a much better film than this one!"
3,ehhh,"not a bad knife, starts off sharp but dulls very quickly. very small and easy to conceal in pocket. very sleek design, but if you don't constantly sharpen it after a week it won't do much at all"
4,matt yeager is awesome,"I enjoyed this book immensely. Quality entries from the usual suspects - Ashbery, Simic, Tate, Ammons - are complimented nicely by a slew of entries from lesser known poets. I won't get into each one, but I will discuss one in particular. I was most fond of Matt Yeager's narrative poem about a giant tin foil ball. It possessed a creativity that seems to me to be dwindling in most American art. You're probably saying, ""a giant tin foil ball?"" Trust me, this is a great work and I can't wait to see more from this young poet."
1,Ladainian Tomlinson Jersey,I need to send this item back because there are black stains across the neckline of the jersey. Please contact me as to how to go about returning this item for a new one.
1,Radio + TV made it totally suck!,"First when I heard this song, I thought this one is pretty decent song knowing this was some linkin park member's solo project. But after hundreds of radio/TV plays it started to suck. Video turned out to be annoying as what, c'mon people floating in the parking hall while the drum solo plays. Now this song sounds just like it was some softer linkin park's pop song."
4,Hilarious comedy about the quirks of dating,"This cast is very funny together. This is not a ""mind bender"" movie - it is just for those who are looking for a good laugh. We can all relate to the quirks and blunders of dating. This movie makes me laugh out loud - over and over. I love it! I am always looking for it at video stores."
1,worst guitar ever,This is the worst guitar I have ever seen - finish is terrible - black paint smeared on frets - looks like it was finished by a monkey - I wanted to return it immediately - I feel cheated - I did not expect this from Amazon!Do not buy one.
2,The griddle is not flat,"I do agree with a previous reviewer (charles). The shipping box was really beaten up. The griddle I've received was not chipped but it was heavily warped (almost 1/2 inch in the center of it). So, I've rejected it. Ten days later I got a new one. The second one was warped too but not as bad as the first one. I think, it can be used. Definitively, you should spend few dollars more to get higher quality griddle."
1,It Rocks and Does the Twist,"And I don't mean that in a good way. It's so far from level it's not funny, and it's not even consistently off level; it's warped. As this is ""cast"" iron, I would assume that they are all like this. This appears to be a company that doesn't much care how shoddy its products are. Normally, I'd send it back but it's just not worth the trouble considering how heavy it is and how difficult it would be to pack and so forth. This is fourth-rate merchandise. So if you don't need something remotely flat and level, you might get it, it's less than most comparable items, but otherwise, look elsewhere and pay a bit more for something decent. And what others say about its reversibility is true, you really can't use both sides, unless you want to re-season it each time you want to use the other side. I figured that, but I only needed to use one side.Frankly, I'm surprise Amazon continues to stock it."
2,Poor quality but works.,Boxes were the most beat up boxes I've ever seen. One griddle was chipped but the cooking surfaces were intact. Slight warp but not bad. Not as thick and well made as other griddles I've had. Cheapest cast iron griddles i could find at this size so some points for economy. Consider spending a bit more if you can find higher quality and someone that will ship with care.
3,Seems bent,"I purchased this product as a gift for my daughter as she was embarking out of college on her first job. I thought that everyone should have a cast iron skillet.As soon as I opened the package, I noticed something odd. It seems to be bent....it peaks in the middle, with the sides sloping down. I don't know if this is the way it's supposed to be (drain off grease?) but it seemed strange. The box it came in was pretty beat up and I didn't really have time to be bothered with sending it back so I kept it.PLUSES: It's HEAVEY cast iron. Heats evenly.MINUSES: It's BENT!Overall, it's a decent enough purchase. I would call the company, though, and ask if it's supposed to be like that."
5,This Is a Beautiful Song.Superb Sound JE!,"Words can not express how much I lovethis song. It's a song we can relate to so much.I love the intro,the verses and the ending.Basically ""Can't nobody sing this song like JE Can!And that's on the real.Keep em comin."
2,Overrated,"""Evolution: The Modern Synthesis"" is a staple of evolutionary teaching today, but I sure don't understand why. It has the same problem the O.J. Simpson prosecution case had - a big pile of facts with no unifying thread, just a wandering narrative that has no apparent theme. More disturbing, Huxley cited Sir Ronald Fisher's ""Genetical Theory of Natural Selection"" heavily and never acknowledged Fisher's warning, as stated in the opening sentence of his book, ""Natural Selection is not evolution.""The writing style is readable enough but is not engaging. As a source of interesting nature trivia it is passable, but the book fails to deliver on the promise of the title. There is no synthesis, just an attempt at reconciling disparate theories of the time."
1,buyer beware,"Most disappointed with ""book"" -- it was a poorly photocopied edition, bound with a plastic binder -- not even a good job at the copy shop. I expected at least a softbound book with a real cover for what I paid (and saw visually represented in the description.) When it says binding unknown, beware. This is simply a brief (40 approx) page report on very general quail habitat and cultivation -- much like a grad student thesis. I expected more information and text for the amount I paid. As I said before, read the fine print and buyer beware -- I've learned my lesson."
5,Great exercise video,"Tie video is one that will definitely make you sweat. Like all exercise videos, you do need to be motivated to stick with the exercise. Overall, I am very pleased with product!"
5,Great work out even for the Fit,"Bob has some great work outs, this being one of them. They are definitely challenging, especially because they're long (an hour or sometimes slightly over), but they're worth it as you get the results you want. I must say though that Bob is a little cheesy in his dvd's with some of the things he says. I have exercised to many of Bob's, Jillian Michael's, and Billy Blanks Tae Bo dvd's, and Jillian Michaels is by far my favorite trainer. She has the most realistic approach that's not cheesy or annoying. If you haven't tried her dvd's I would recommend any of hers."
4,Good overall workout.,"I forgot that I was sore from a previous workout, until I was into my squats. But I managed to get through it all. I would say it's a good overall workout. I like to work the ""whole body""...not big into breaking down body parts. This is a nice combination of both the weights and the cardio and I worked up a great sweat. I love how he does an isometric hold, after exhausting a body part. Will definitely keep this in my rotation.I can see where it might get a little boring, however....it gets the job done. And we're in it for the ""results"", right?"
5,Bob outdoes himself!,"The workout itself was excellent. Bob knows exactly what he's doing to vary your heart rate from moderate to high level. Just when you think you can't push any longer, he gives you a bit of a ""break,"" before boosting you up again. There is a lot of jumping in this workout, which I love, but it may be hard for some people. There are a lot of lunges and squats, with jumping variations, as well as some upper body strength work. When you think you've gotten to the end and you think Bob will return to his normal calm, yoga-loving self, he pushes you even harder. This is definitely one of the most intense workouts I've done.The studio was different in this workout. To me it appeared that they were exercising on some kind of spaceship. It was a little strange at first, but to me what is most important is the quality of the workout. I also prefer the covers of his Inside Out series, but these are nitpicky things. The workout was OUTSTANDING."
5,Awesome Cardio Workout!!!,"This workout is an hour of intense cardio moves. There are some segments when weights are needed, but I recommend keeping the weights low to start (I used 5 lbs but I probably could have used 8 for some moves). I consider myself in pretty good shape and this workout kicked my butt!! I must warn you there are LOTS of squats and lunges, so if you have bad knees this might not be the workout for you. I absolutely loved it and will put it in my workout rotation.If you are looking for a butt-kicking good cardio workout, this one is for you!"
3,Don't Buy this and his new Kettlebell DVD,This is a fine workout but I decided to do it today after doing his kettlebell DVD yesterday. I was shocked to find it was almost the exact same moves just with 2 weights rather than the kettlebell. If you have this one don't bother with the kettlebell one and if you have the kettlebell don't waste your money on this one. I turned it off after 10 min. since I was hoping to work different muscles today. I switched to one of his first Biggest Loser Cardios instead.
3,Bob Harper - Ultimate Cardio Body,"If you have Bob Harper - Pure Burn conditioning and Cardio Conditioning DVDs, you shouldn't purchase this DVD since the exercises are basically the same. I was a little disappointed since I was not challenged."
1,waste of money,"not good, too boring. i thought it would pump my heart with this exercise. Tracey Mallet and Billy Blanks are far better."
5,Great workout,"I am always searching for workout dvds that are not too boring or easy....i just picked this up at Target not knowing anything about Bob, I don't watch The Biggest Loser....I loved it. It was challenging, but in a good way. Bob has a great personality that is motivating without putting you down. I'm glad i picked it up and plan on buying more of his workouts."
5,INTENSE WORKOUT,"Bob delivers another hardcore sweat inducing workout. I have done his Inside Out Series and would say it is on the same level for intermediate to advanced exercisers. Some of the moves are similar but he also adds some fresh variety. It was a tough workout but not so hard you cannot complete the sets. I enjoyed it more than the Inside Out Series as he pushes you hard, however, you change moves before it becomes too intense. This allows you to maintain good form throughout. There are trailers for upcoming videos that appear to be just as challenging. Keep them coming Bob."
4,Ultimate Cardio?,"Let me start by saying that I am a cardio junkie. Whenever I purchase a workout DVD 9 times out of 10 I'm looking for something to really get my heart pumping.I was so excited to try out this DVD because of it's title... ULTIMATE CARDIO BODY!!Well, the workout doesn't quite live up to that title. There were moments when I could feel my heart rate getting elevated, but it wasn't a feeling that I had frequently throughout the workout.Having said that, I don't think this is a bad workout. There are a lot of difficult moves that really challenge your body and you'll probably be sore the next day.All in all it is a good workout but it isn't ULTIMATE CARDIO."
5,Tragic holiday,"A great history, of a forgotten piece of Chicago history. A personal piece of my life, as some of the passengers were related to myself. To read, in details, the events of that faithful day, brings much knowledge, about my extended family. Highly recommended story."
4,Great way to learn about a forgotten tragedy,"I had not heard of this tragedy until Amazon recommended this book to me. Despite it's terrible subject, it is a book that grabs the reader and after one is done, makes one want to go research more on the subject. The author did a great job documenting the senseless acts of human error both before and after the accident. Like so many other senseless cases, it leaves us looking back in retrospect slapping our foreheads asking over and over, ""Why?"""
2,Digital photography...very 1st step,The book didn't cost much so I can't say too much bad about it although I wanted more. This is a book that isn't updated to digital slr yet. It's a lot of stuff on here that you can/have learned without the book. You're better off taking a night class in photography 1 at a junior college or getting a more up to date book with more information.... alot more information.
5,THOMAS & FRIENDS HALLOWEEN DOUBLE FEATURE DVD,My 2 1/2 year old grandson loves this DVD which has two movies on one DVD. He watches it over and over.
1,Disappointing,"My 3 year old grandson loves Thomas but this video is pretty lame. He kept asking me ""why don't their lips move when they talk?"""
4,Strawberry and Chocolate,"Strawberry and chocolate, I found to be enjoyable and moving. It's surface is presented humorously, while serious issues are the underlying foundation of the film. The friendship between the two main characters, and the confict of a nation in distress create a link between two seemingly unrelated issues. The casting is a defenite film strength, although the occasional use of unusual focal points are visually distracting. However, with dialoge, script and happy camera placemment, the film is well worth the time."
3,Not a Bad Berry....,"It's a good movie, but not what I expected. From the amount of foreign films I've seen, there have been some outstanding ones like Central Station, City Of Lost Children, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Like Water for Chocolate and Amelie. I guess I hold all foreign (subtitled) films to this high standard. The actor who played Diego, Jorge Perrugoria was wonderful though. He's one of those few actors that uses his eyes to convey so much internal action. Over all, I'm not saying the film was bad, but it wasn't one I'd watch again and again. First film from Cuba nominated for an Oscar.. *** stars"
1,Dull,"This is a foreign film from Cuba. It's a story of a developing friendship between a gay man Diego who enjoys the finer things in life and a young Communist student. A first the student David is repelled by Diego and had to be manipulated to go to Diego's apartment. Slowly, David becomes Diego's buddy and he explores new ways at looking at life. Diego neighbor Nancy gets romantically involved with David.Truthfully, this movie bored me. I don't care if it got nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture."
5,"Fantastic Book, a must read","I stumbled upon this book a a while ago and was hooked on the first page, it is definitely a must read. But be very careful you could find your self falling for the characters as they are so well written you think you know them personally.Buy it and you'll read it again and again wishing to be part of the story. Keep it up Josh!"
4,A dark journey of self-discovery,"Fresh from high school, Will begins an evolution that bewilders those around him. His girlfriend breaks up with him and he moves out of his parents' house into Aidan's apartment. After discovering that Aidan is gay, Will comes to understand himself better, and the two stumble into a relationship. When one of Will's lifelong friends dies, he's heartbroken, and then the clues seem to indicate that the death was murder. With the help of Killian Kendall (from Aterovis's first book), Will investigates his friend's death, and soon finds death surrounding him. ""Reap the Whirlwind"" is a great coming-out and coming-of-age tale in all its flaming glory. The book tackles family rejection and atonement, and balances them with a heartfelt love story as the novel plunges into the dark abyss of attempted suicide and personal tragedies. Josh Aterovis limns in vivid detail the upheavals of coming out, as well as delighting audiences with an engrossing mystery."
2,Depressing,"I got halfway through this book before I had to put it down. The only characters I felt anything for were Aiden and one of the narrator's best friends. The narrator was a whiner, the male 'best friend' was a jerk and the new girl was a psychotic mess. The mystery was almost no mystery; once you got halfway through and more people started dying, you pretty much knew 'who done it'."
1,Nice breathing exercises....,"I bought this tape on Amazon, and I bought it to lose weight. I was using this tape 4 times a week for 6 weeks, and I didn't see any results. I didn't lose any inches or pounds. The makers of this tape like to say that you will lose weight by breathing more oxygen etc., but I didn't lose any.You do alot of deep breathing, and the actual tape quality and background wasnot professional looking.If you are buying this tape to lose pounds and inches, this isn't the tape for you. If you are looking for a tape with alot of deep breathing, and for relaxation, then this is your tape. Hope this helps."
2,Just Not my Thing,"This may work for some people, but quite honestly, I'd rather actually work out than just breathe. Just breathing is booooring. I do think this is a good exercise for the lungs, though."
5,"The Z-Sword breaks, and here comes Gotenks!","This video rules! I'm not going to tell you everything that happens but Hercule becomes friends with Buu, Goten and Trunks finally fuse,Gohan breaks the Z-Swored,and Piccolo shows Trunks how to move his hands."
4,Good product,"i like the smell it is very nicely scented, and the bubble last long time...and it was very affordable.."
1,Misleading product name!,"I thought this item merely had new packaging, since the name is exactly the same as that of a product I've been happily using for years - NOT SO! It's entirely different, the only similarity being that it bubbles in the bath. There's almost no fragrance (an important feature in a relaxing bath!), and it doesn't soften the bath water or the skin as the old product did. It might be an OK shower scrub, but that's not why I bought it - I'm very disappointed, and will not be ordering it again. NO stars!"
5,Large volume of thick foamy bubbles,"As other reviewers have noted, it doesn't take a tremendous amount to get a lot of bubbles. The bubbles are very rich and foamy - like something you'd see in a movie. If you're like me, you may just find yourself building bubble sculptures. :-)The scent is lovely. Sometimes lavender can be overpowering, but not in this case. Perfect for a relaxing soak; the bubbles last and last. It does leave the bottom of the tub VERY slippery so use caution getting in and out! Other than that, it's perfect."
3,Not sealed properly,"I'm not sure why this company doesn't seal their products, especially liquids! The cap was loose when I opened the package and some of the product had leaked out. It wasn't a huge deal, and it smells great, but i haven't used it. I purchased this as a gift and i can't help but think that the giftee might think that I opened it already? Normally, there would be a foil seal under the cap! No such thing!"
3,Good Flavor but,Reasonably decent flavor but POWDERED herbs do not hold too well in cooking and that very leafy quality does add to the dish.
3,What a fun read!,"I enjoyed this book so much for what it was! A rollicking tale of southern women whom I would love to know. The Belle women should be models for all.This book does not tax one's brain or intellect. It will never, ever appear on a ""summer mandatory reading list"". But it is great fun!The Rock Orchard is one of those books that has you wanting to emulate .. no duplicate.. one of the characters. What is more fun than that?Fun read! I recommend it as that and I would buy the author's next book without hesitation."
5,Magical and Oh so fun to read....,I had a blast meeting the Belle women. They were sassy and smart. I loved how they lived their lives in full color. They owned Leaper's Fork in more ways than one. The other characters I enjoyed were Boone and KyAnn. Along with the Belle women they turned icy Yankees and stiff outsiders into passionate red hot blooded humans . I loved every minute of The Rock Orchard. It's a wonderfully great Southern novel.
5,The Rock Orchard: A Novel,"This was one of our book club books for February. We enjoyed the way Paula Wall intertwined her characters, story line and southern wisdom. This book brought forth a lively discussion on southern living, southern morals and some of the best quotes we have had in our book discussions.We liked the way Charlotte gave advice to Mila and how it turned Mila's life around for the better. As Charlotte said, ""we are what we are, until we decide to be different."""
4,A wild book!,"This book was wild from beginning to end. Although enjoyable, it was here and there and everywhere. I loved reading about this person and this person doing this, and the list goes on.I don't even know where to begin in the story but it has so many different storylines, you will feel like you are watching a soap opera. I am unsure of why the title is what it is. The only thing I can figure is the cemetary?One thing is for sure, just when you think you have it all figured out and are deadset on one thing, think again! We also learned that people marry for all the wrong reasons and sometimes people can't help who they love.Enjoy!"
5,MUST READ!,"I loved every minute of this book. The characters were unique, southern, and kept you wanting more. Great story line! One of my top 3 favorite books of all time."
2,Very Disappointed,"I had read all the reviews and couldn't wait to read this book-I should have waited. The author could not make up her mind which characters to write about, she tied it all up in the end but it would have been so much better to create more of a background on each of the main characters instead of talking about people you could not remmber who they were because she had written so little about them."
4,Sexually Charming,"I have to be honest with you - I'm not sure why I liked this book, but I did. From beginning to end. THE ROCK ORCHARD tells the stories of the people in Leaper's Fork, Tennessee focusing on the Belle family of women. What I liked best about the story was how it became a series of connected short stories, like pieces of material all pulled together into one beautiful quilt.Even though this is a little simple, a little hokey, a little quirky, it is definitely worth reading. Sit back, relax, and enjoy your visit to Leaper's Fork."
3,movie and captions,"The movie is OK; it's not my favorite, but I didn't think it was awful. It's probably less entertaining to adults than to small fry, but it has its moments. The closed captions are EXCELLENT, but I couldn't find that any of the extra stuff was captioned, which is a shame because some of the ecology/endangered species material is pretty interesting."
4,Dr. Dolittle: Tail to the Chief,"It is a very cute movie, and my daughter likes the Dr. Dolittle movies. This Dr. Dolittle is all about one of the daughters being able to talk to animals like her dad. It also does not have Eddie Murphy in this one, but it is still a good one to watch."
4,A Doolittle too many?,"Did we leave the ranch, and then didn't get prepared to go to college? Or return to senior year of high school and not take a single college prep course? That part was thin. And it was nice to know that everyone knew she could talk to animals this time--rather than the HIDE THE ABILITY routine. Lucky rocks, he gets the best lines in all the moives."
3,girls liked it,"as with most sequels the quality goes down after the first few....girls still liked it though, come by my profile to visit my blog"
2,"Subpar Sutherland, decent Durning, laughable movie","I agree with the previous reviewer: Donald Sutherland acts like he's sleepwalking thru the entire movie. He's done much better work than this. Charles Durning is good, but the problem is that this isn't a very good murder mystery. It is worth a look for a couple of reasons, though. There are some lines that are really funny (unintentionally, I'm afraid).But the #1 reason to see it: THE A-1 STEAK SAUCE GUY DID IT!!!! I think the actor's name is Jim Murtaugh. I'm not joking, so see it if you're curious. ;)"
3,Like a Geitorturers show?...not likely,"I gave Society of Genitorture three stars only because Gen is soo hot she makes it more bearable.This DVD is a very bad portrayal of a very good show. If you like the Genitorturers and have seen them live you will know that this DVD does no justice to the Genitorturers capablity to shock. It is more distastful than shocking with bad angles and strange camera tricks. Viewing this DVD and not knowing much or not seeing a show would only negate someone's view of the Genitorturers.I definitely recommend watching the Interview with Gen first, esp if you or someone you are showing this DVD to doesn't know much about the Genitorturers. It is a very nice interview with her. I only wish it could have been longer and possibly a little more personal.Something interesting to see once, i guess, but it is not necessary to view. Life will go on if you pass this one up."
2,Whats wrong with me,"I fantasize about women with whips all the time, but I found this film boring. I dont know what to do?"
5,Loved It,"I first seen this movie when I was about 6 years old, I thought it was funny then, and I still find it funny today. Its a good family movie that one can sit with the kids and have family time along with a laugh or two."
4,"One of the better old, mediocre Disney movies","While not a top movie, there are a lot worse ones out there. The movie starts slowly with unimpressive dialogue, but stick it out. The movie gets funnier fast as Don Knotts shows up. It's typical clean Disney, with drawn-out suspense and long car-chase."
1,4 1/2 star Movie but a 1 Star DVD!,"I like Kim Richards, she is really very pretty and is a a very good actress and I wish I had hair like hers!No Deposit No Returns is a good movie and I've been waiting for so long for it to come to DVD but now that it has come to DVD I'm mad that the transfer is stinky and it is only fullframe and not widescreen.Does Disney hate widescreen or something?FYI: Kim Richards in real life is the aunt of Paris and Nicky Hilton. Their mother Kathy is Kim's sister."
3,disney movies,"Hopefully this movie will be watched by my grandchildren, before all the good movies are gone."
3,"Cute movie, bad transfer","This is a typical Disney live-action film of the 70's. The comedy is thin at times (you almost expect a laugh-track to kick in at any moment to say ""This is supposed to be funny""), but it has its moments. Don Knotts does well in his role, but he a little underused. Still, it's a good way for a family to spend time together one rainy Saturday afternoon.Now on to the DVD transfer. It's sad. They didn't try to clean it up digitally or anything. It looks like they just used a VHS tape and threw it on a DVD. The quality of this film makes me a little leery about buying the next set they throw out. While I love to see these classics finally come to DVD, I hate to see them wasted on a junky transfer. If you have this one on VHS, don't waste your money to upgrade. And yes, it's in fullscreen with no extras other than the ""trailer"" (a 30 second television spot)."
5,Based on classic O. Henry story,"This is a good Disney film- moderately worthy of the easily attached title of ""classic."" Exellent actors make it lively. The plot itself is great. It is the plot from O. Henry's story, ""A Retrieved Reformation."" I've tried to figure out if Disney ever gave him credit and it seems like they didn't. Anyway, it's a terrific story and the movie actually does it decent justice. Nothing objectionable. Suitable for all ages."
2,A little to much hype on here about this book,It is a good book for reading but not as a refrence. If you in the trade and want a book for the plane ride...ok. But will you learn anything new...Maybe. If you read JLC (Journal of Light Construction) and keep up with the trade you won't find anything new here. If you a novice with basic knowledge and want an overview of building that is well written but poorly photographed and lacking when it comes to illustrations...then buy the book. For refrence and true learning for not just professionals but every day people I would recommend JLC Field Guides or Graphic Guide to Framing...either will suit you well no matter what your level of skill.
4,Good starter book,"This book was very helpful at introducing me to the framing trade. It is nicely laid out and eay to understand, but requires a small amount of construction knowledge for the reader to gain the full benefit. I'm from Washington State and although the book describes building practices from other parts of the country, with the help and advice from local builders and suppliers, I was able to successfully build a 2600 square foot two story home."
2,Inferior to other CDs with Atlantic years recordings,"This very limited complilation I've Got a Woman and Other Hits (Golden Archives) by Flashback Records (Warner Music Group) of just 10 Ray Charles hits from 1954 to 1959 of his Atlantic years beginning in 1953 is not to be mistaken for the excellent namesake compilation (UPC: 8026575135222) I Got a Woman of 2004 by Universe Italy with 56 singles released between 1949 and 1955. The Atlantic years recordings are by far better represented on The Definitive Ray Charles, The Definitive Soul Collection, and The Best of Ray Charles: The Atlantic Years."
4,Great for learning,I bought this for my teenage niece at her request since she used it in school. She loves it and I think it's a wonderful tutorial.
1,Previous purchasers of the Mavis software,"This is terrible. I had purchased Mavis back in the day and now with my children needing to type I thought this was the product to buy because of my computer operation system incarnations. I thought, MAVIS...the software I had eight years ago, but:After reading the posts...If there is no help or no support or no avenue for this software, then I would have to say, don't buy it. (I say this with a heavy heart. Mavis, what happened.)I shall have to search elsewhere for my children's typing software...sorrySincerely,Daniel CraigArizona"
2,Mavis Beacon not good for a beginner,"I homeschool my daughter and know she needs to learn to type. I bought this product because of the brand name recognition. IMO, there are not enough drills. She learned the homerow pretty well but then was expected to incorporate capitalization and numbers. She needed much more practice and drilling with lowercase a-z before she moved to capitalization and numbers. There aren't even any drills to do on our own, only dictation which includes, of course, capitalization, symbols and numbers.So I am in the market for an age appropriate product. She needs to be drilled a few letters at a time until those are habit.Would not recommend for a person with no prior typing experience."
4,Love,"I bought 2 books. One had a diagonal fold on the top cover of the book 3/4 of an inch from the top, the other had a small tear along the top edge of the binding. Although the physical condition of the books seemed like they had been browsed at a bookstore, the book is a delight to read. It brings back old memories of being in love, whether it be passionate love, unrequited love, or breaking someone else's heart. The poems about love are somethings people can relate to. It will make you laugh even when you're all alone in a room and evoke past emotions and memories. I gave the other book as a gift to my friend and she immediately loved it!"
1,"sorry, don't waste your money!","Whoever told Ms. Steel she could be a poet, was wrong!!! So very wrong! I had to force myself to complete her book. A good writer she defintely is, a poet she is not. I wrote her type of poetry in the fifth grade- or maybe younger. She is right up there with the famous Dr. Sesus!!!"
1,"A Fabulous ""Love"" Laugh","This book is hysterical. The poetry is so bad that it's pure humor. I was with friends reading these poems aloud the other evening and everyone was laughing so hard they were crying. If you are a fan of legitimate poetry, YOU CANNOT PASS THIS UP. You'll (hopefully) never get another opportunity to laugh so hard in all of your life."
1,Absolutely The Worst Poetry Ever,"After reading Jewel Kilcher's 'A Night Without Armor,' I thought that no poetry could ever be as bad, ever again. I thought that maybe we all would have learned a lesson. Oh, how I was wrong.Steel's poetry isn't as bad as Jewel's; it's worse.She wouldn't know meter if it came up to her, shook her hand, introduced itself, and took her to dinner and a movie. She has no concept of craft, artistry, or revision. She treats line breaks as if convention was purely arbitrary - almost every poem has the exact same structure. Everything about this collection is one hundred percent bad.I am ashamed of Steel, I am ashamed of the publishers, and I am ashamed of the people who continue to buy this utter garbage instead of actual literature.'Love' is worthless."
1,"""Love"" hurts","I actually haven't read this, but on the Conan O'brien show Tina Fey took this book on and read an excerpt as part of her COMEDY! It's that bad."
1,Poems by Danielle Steele,Just a bunch of poetry & not a story like the rest of her books. I like her love story books & this was nothing like her work
3,Good fleece but bleeds fleece!,"Nice warm fleece, but the fleece keeps coming off! Used it on the Gokyo and EBC trek in Nepal and it did not disappoint. The only minus is the fleece keeps coming off. I hope it lasts us a few years."
4,PENCIL ME IN,"Collagen injection for more attractive lips? Ouch! Not for me - I'll be delighted with a neat, clean lip line. That's exactly what I get from this Joey New York Super Duper Lipstick Pencil.The pencil is soft so that it doesn't pull thus distorting lip lines, yet firm so that it can be applied with accuracy. Best of all perhaps is the neutral shade so that it can be used with any color lipstick.Sorry the image doesn't show that the casing is a bright cheery red, so it's fun to have and terrific to use."
2,Joyce Verdral Exercise DVD,I bought this DVD for a vertical ab workout. There are exactly three exercises in this regard. This DVD was a big disappointment.
2,Did'nt like it...,"I am a big fan of Joyce Vedral's book series. I have, at one time or another, owned all of them. I bought this DVD thinking it would be equal or better than the books..I was so disappointed. This DVD was just not my cup of tea at all.I thought it was boring, poorly produced, too much lag time in between exercises, not well cued...just not a great exercise DVD at all for me.I really wish I liked it more because her books are great!"
3,"Good Attempt, But Only For Non-Economics People","This book is a good overview of the field. Basic microeconomic concepts that are relevant are introduced progressively, which is good for people who are either rusty in economics or lack even the most basic background.On the whole, however, this book is too simple for a serious study of the field if you are an economics undergraduate, because beyond the microeconomics section, the rest of the book consists mainly of definitions or citations, one after another.The author quotes a lot from other sources, which is good if you're looking for a summary to the field. But in this way , there is little additional analysis."
2,THIS IS NOT CARPET THREAD / Works ok for bottons,"THIS PRODUCT IS NOT REAL CARPET THREAD but it does work for buttons if you double it. Please do yourself a favor, If you need real carpet thread go and get it from a shop that sales carpet (you can find catpet dealers in the yellow pages.If you need a product that is a little stronger than normal thread go ahead a buy that product BUT REAL CARPET THREAD IS MUCH STRONGER."
1,worthless,"This is the worst thread I have ever used. It is so ""shaggy"" and thin it kept getting wadded up in the bobbin. It's actually hard to find decent thread anymore since it's all made in China. I'm sorry, but the quality of so many things made in China are just terrible...just go to the solid waste dump and look around."
2,Thread,They arrived on time. Good price. I bought this product years ago and couldnt find it in the stores anywhere but was able to find it online. This product has changed since I bought it years ago. I still have some from when I bought the original and the comparison is no contest. This is no reflection on the company that I bought this from. The original thread I bought was a more superior quality and back then apparently was still made in the USA. Now its made in China and it has a shred quality about that it did not originally have. Had I known all that I probably would still have bought it but I would not have bought as much of it. Singer you need to go back to making this particular product in the USA.
5,Wind back the clock to 70s Britain,"Huge energy in these episodes with strong undercurrents of aggression, humour, naivety.This far from their currency the comedy and its production has a feel of an ethnographic study of British working class life."
5,Til Death Us Do Part,"Ken and I really enjoyed the humour albeit very un Brady BunchIt gets loud,but makes our marriage seem like it was made in heaven"
4,Good magazine,"MIT's Technology Review covers a respectable range of technological topics, ranging from, for example, computer security to the guts of an iPad to anti-aging drugs, all in one issue. Also includes a neat section called ""To Market,"" which highlights various tech products, which could be light bulbs, bomb detectors, solar charger, electric vehicles and robots. Shows just how fascinating science can be. A credit to science publishing.I picked it up in the store and became a subscriber immediately thereafter."
5,Great,"While it won't replace my Scientific American, that's only my personal preference. MIT TR leans toward the business and economics side of technology by tracking start-ups, new tech, energy projects and other things. Of course there are more in depth articles that are always very well written - it's just not ALL science like SciAm. If that's what you like, this magazine is for you."
4,Small and quiet ceiling heater,"I bought this unit after I tried 2 other units made by Air King and NuTone. I was not happy with either the Air King or NuTone units and returned them primarily because they looked cheaply made...with plastic internals and plastic grate covering. I was primarily looking for a unit that was no bigger than 9x14"" rough in, so I didn't have a lot of options.This unit, although 240V can also support 120V. Other models made by King are available too.Why this unit is better than the Air King or NuTone is that there are no plastic parts in this unit. Everything is metal. Its smaller and has similar output. It is also significantly quieter than those two. The NuTone was EXTREMELY loud. The Air King was better, but still noisy. This King model is almost imperceptible when it comes to sound.The only downside of this unit is that it doesn't come with bells and whistles like a light or night light. It does one thing - heat fan, thats all."
4,Another Bruce Lee classic,"The Chinese Conection is one of my favorite Martial Arts films. Bruce Lee is un-doubtly the best martial artist of all time and it's a joy to see him do what he does best. Fight. Also, the plot is a noch above most kung fu films(thats not saying much) and delves into the racial violence between the Japanese and Chinese."
1,Absolutely horrid,"As others have said, the worst DVD I've seen. Not only were the transfers done from what appear to be film that was played so much it was scratched and broken, the audio is terrible. On Chinese Connection, it's too slow (makes everyone sound like a dying record player). Madacy is off the list; I sent them email to complain and never heard a word back. The CASE is worth more than this sorry disc!"
4,"I enjoyed the film, like more action than dialogue.","My view on this particular movie was that Bruce Lee was no doubt the best in this field of Martial Arts still today people everyone if they are martial arts fans such as myself talks about how this man became a legend in his own time, he is considered the BEST.. I like the film not only because I'm a fan of Bruce Lee, but because I like martial arts films. It rates high on my list."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"It has been well over a month since I ordered this CD, and here it is 31 July 2009 and I still have not received this order:-("
1,DVD Review,"Get the Media Asia version instead. It is sold under it's original title ""Fist of Fury"". It has a pristine widescreen transfer and comes with 5 audio tracks (English, Cantonese, Mandarin and two audio commentaries in English and Cantonese). It also comes with 8 different subtitles. Plus it has unseen footage from Game of Death and five trailers for all of Bruce films. What's really cool about the trailers are that they are the original HK versions. This DVD version blows away every other release of this film. This is the only way to buy this movie if you don't want to be disappointed. Also, the soundtrack has been remixed in 5.1 Dolby Digital using the original soundtrack. Even though there is not much rear channel sound information it is much better than the mono sound on the other releases."
1,defective transfer,"not only does the quality of this dvd suck, the side with the chinese connection runs at about 85% speed, so everyone sounds like james earl jones - even the women.keeeRAP."
1,A disgrace.,"I bet Bruce Lee is spinning in his grave as we speak over this dvd. Everyone in Chinese Connection sounds like George the Animal Steel and do not get me started on the picture quality of both films. I would rather pay the money to get my head bashed in than trying to figure out what the characters are saying and make out the action going on during the films. I implore you to save the money and buy the Bruce Lee box set or another Bruce Lee dvd other than this one. Believe me, You would be happy and Bruce Lee would be happy."
1,Do NOT buy this disc!!,"This is the worst example of a sleazy quick-buck artist scamming the marketplace I've ever run across. The disc is unwatchable, even for a moderate fan of Bruce Lee, like myself. Apparently, they took someone's extremely worn out copy of a video tape and transferred it directly to DVD. I actually shut it off in the middle of the climactic fight scene because it was so bad. That was after having muted it to preserve my hearing from the hiss and squeals in the audio. My recommendation is to avoid anything from Madacy Entertainment, the perpetrator of this ripoff."
1,fists of fury / chinese conection,"i will start by saying this. the quality of this dvd stinks! the picture itself looks like it was dubbed from an old 8mm film reel. and the sound on the side with the CHINESE CONECTION on it has an extreamly bad sound quality. it sounded like the voice tracks were slowed down and everyone sounded like james earl jones. i am just sickend by this. and seeing that i opened the package , i can not return it. i guess i will be stuck with it. buyer beware!"
2,"Great films, but poor quality in picture.",Neiter film is presented in the widescreen format the movies were originally filmed in. FISTS has video glitches toward the end that one normally sees on a VHS tape and could otherwise be fixed with tracking. CONNECTION has poor pan & scan. The cheap price of the DVD helps explain but not justify these faults.
2,Very Dissapointing,"While I love Bruce Lee films, the production company did a horrible job of remastering to digital format. The sound and the picture in both movies left much to be desired."
3,Soundtrack is absurd!,"It seems this movie has been ruined by the overdubbed english soundtrack. There is no option to hear the original soundtrack with subtitles, so you wind up listening to an extremely corny and poorly performed translation. If this film is re-released with chinese audio I will buy the DVD for my collection. You might want to avoid this one, unless you desire to witness the opitomy of awful overdubs."
3,Bruce Lee's first starring role,"Released in Asia as ""The Big Boss"", this is Bruce Lee's first film in the starring role. The setting is in Thailand where a group of immigrant Chinese find work at an ice factory run by the local mob. After a number of his co-workers mysteriously disappear, Lee finds himself having to confront the Thai mob and eventually the Big Boss himself.Bruce's skills are superb as always but his opposition are a ragtag bunch of petty hoodlums with little martial skill. A good lesson in how to take on 10 guys with knives and iron rods."
1,"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE, A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED RIP OFF","Amazon should ban sellers of this DVD. It looks like someone copied a VHS to DVD. It sounds like James Earl Jones is doing voice overs FOR EVERY CHARACTER, women included. And there are no sound effects during the fights. I almost want to sue the seller, on principle alone."
1,Helpful opinion,"When I first bought the 2-sided dvd, I thought cool, I get two movies for a good price, but no. I would stay away from this and highly recommend buying the Box set or Bruce Lee collection, as it is a much better buy. This dvd is unrestored, has no option for subtitles, comes only in fullscreen, has no extra content that I think is worthwhile, and furthermore, both movies were not uncut as in the box set, which I bought later on. So anyways, go for the Bruce Lee Collection instead."
1,poor looking dvd,this is the worst quality i seen in a long time. i thought this was a great deal. it was very cheep and i said i would by it. some one warned me about it. but i thought they were being picky so i bought it anyway. when i put the dvd in. i was very upset by how the picture was so poor and the audio was also. i usually dont leave reviews but i have to let people know not to by this verison of the classic bruce lee flicks. you will be very upset about it.
1,"FIST OF FURY, NOT CHINESE CONNECTION","True this is Bruce Lee at his best, BUT, this DVD is TERRIBLE! The video transfer is poor and the audio (and I don't mean the dubbing)is low, low, low. Definitely get the Media Asia Version which is in it's original language (Cantanese/Mandarin)with an optional English track in GET THIS, 5.1 Dolby Digital. The picture is crisp and bright. And also please refer to this movie as ""FIST OF FURY"" and Not ""The Chinese Connection"" when you purchase this from the Media Asia Version. That said I also suggest you buy all of Bruce Lee's other movies (The Big Boss, Way of the Dragon, Game of Death) from Media Asia you'll be very happy with your money's worth."
1,Very Horrible product.,I am very dissappointed with this product. There is an over dubbed of the voices that is not the original sound and picture quality is horrible. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"HORRIBLE,HORRIBLE PRODUCT! The sound is at least five minutes off after the first few minutes, and the movie cuts off before the end. You will not see the entire movie, so you're wasting your money. The transfer quality is very poor, as well. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I was able to get a refund from Amazon and bought a satisfactory copy from another vendor."
5,EXCELLENT!,"Arrived early and brand new just like describe! Very pleased, am building collection as gift for friend who's a big Bruce Lee fan. Amazon is making it easy and affordable!"
5,"Bruce shines in this, his best the lot","I love this movie and still think its Lee at his best. Between the scene of him as a very awkward phone repairman, and the scene where he takes on a horde of bad guys with Nunchucks, this is his most complete performance on screen to me and showed his talent at its best. This transfer is of a much better quality than most of the releases out there of this movie. If you ever wanted to see just how good and talented Bruce was, just watch this one and find out.The story is standard for these movies but Lee bumps the action and the acting up to give this one it's true classic reputation."
2,This is a review of the Laugh Track version,I wanted to like this but in the behind the scenes interviews they show little respect for Bruce Lee and that got me started off on the wrong foot. Then I watch it and it just isn't that clever. I did laugh once or twice but i expected something more along the lines of What's Up Tiger Lilly. At least they could have had the actors play orientals. Too bad because this concept could have been funny.
5,bruce lee is the man!!!!!,"while i agree the transfer is not as good as some dvds, it's really not all that bad people, and you get 2 movies for the price of one dvd. i thought this was worth my ten dollars, and you can't deny how good these classics really are. they're not as good as enter the dragon, but they are awesome movies."
5,Bruce Lee at his finest!,"This is the best of Bruce Lee's work. The fight sequences are amazing! And director Lo Wei did a perfect job as well - camera angles, zooms, script, everything! The Chinese Connection is a must have for any martial arts fan. Even if you've never seen a Bruce Lee film, YOU MUST SEE THIS ONE! The only complaint I have is that it is dubbed in English. I wish there was a DVD in the States that had the original audio with English subtitles, but I think the only way to get it is to special order an import. Still, it's a great movie well worth owning."
1,this thing blows!!!,"This thing blows!!! - Crappy production, not funny, and a bad attempt at copying a good idea.- damn it don't get much worse than this piece of junk. York needs to stick to those cheap and grimey street gang flicks they have been putting out and leave the comedy and kung fu to people who know how to get down. Take a pass on this joint big time, and pick up ""Kung Faux : Volume 1"" on dvd if you want the real deal."
4,Hilarious Kung Fu Action!,"The Chinese Connection is a truly exemplary kung fu movie. Replete with laughable fight scenes, whiplash sound effects, and attrocious dubbing, the Chinese Connection will satisfy your cravings for random violence and unintentional humor!When Bruce Lee's kung-fu teacher is killed, an evil Japanese kung fu school comes to take over the Chinese dojo! Countless brawls ensue as the leader of the Japanese dojo, fearsome fat man with horn-rimmed glasses, leads his students into battle.The only downside to this movie is a dull middle. The beginning and end are crammed full of action, but nothing happens in the middle."
1,AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL,ATTENTION ATTENTION! People do not waste your money. This disc is worse than bad. Spend the extra 10 bucks and get the good version of both movies. On the Chinese Connection the sound is so slow. It sounds like you are playin a 45rpm record on 33rpms (those of you under 30 won't understand). Fists of Fury looks like it was dubbed off of a 50 year old version of the film. People shouldn't be allowed to deface Bruce's art with this garbage.
1,Looking for a good copy of these 2 movies? Don't look here!,"Madacy's Double Feature edition of these classic Bruce Lee films, is by far the worst. ""THE CHINESE CONNECTION"", runs over 2 hours, but, hold your breath...that doesn't equate extra footage, it means that the film transfer is so slow, both sound and picture, that it stretches the film's running time by nearly 20 minutes! Both films look horrible, and are not uncut.Also, GOODTIMES version of ""CHINESE CONNECTION"", although it is widescreen(2.35:1), runs only 103 min., versus the full running time of 107 minutes. The version from DML, also sucks. Go with THE MASTER COLLECTION from CBS/FOX Video, c/o 20th Century-Fox Entertainment. That's what I did."
1,ZERO RATING WE ARE NOT LYING,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. FISTS OF FURY IS EXCEPTABLE BUT CHINESE CONNECTION IS HORRIBLE EVERYONE HAS BARRYWHITE'S VOICE IT IS UNWATCHABLE. PAY A LITTLE MORE FOR THE DRAGON COLLECTION IT IS WORTH IT!
3,Master Collection?,"I bought this edition of the DVD so that i would get the ""higher quality version"", as opposed to the one that retails for 4.99...what a disappointment? I don't understand how Fox can market this in a box set with cool packaging as anything different than the low quality version. The picture is grainy, the sound is terrible, and the ""Theatrical Trailer"", featured on amazon.com, AND on the back of the case in the menu screenshot is non-existent! If you're going to pick this DVD up and don't want to get completely hosed, buy the cheaper version bundled with Fists Of Fury. Same quality, better deal. I can't believe that fox video can get away with such a con job in nice packaging."
1,Bruce Lee...DISRESPECTED,"I thought I was the only one with a horrible DVD dub of two of Bruce Lee's master films. The six dollar plus videotapes I bought from Wal-Mart a few years back look and sound better. I was so ticked off at the Chinese Connection(I mean who did the audio). I thought Fists of Fury was a little bit better(not in a good way). The reviewers are true fans, don't doubt us. (DO NOT BUY...I REPEAT...DO NOT BUY THIS PARTICULAR COPY). This was no tribute to one of the greatest(if not the greatest)martial artist of the 20th century. If Bruce were alive he'd probably execute his death blow to this DVD, like he did to The Big Boss' son at the factory near the end of Fists of Fury...the fans know what part I'm talking about. YOU WILL TRULY HONOR BRUCE'S LEGEND AND LEGACY BY NOT BUYING THIS PARTICULAR DVD COPY. No disrespect to Amazon.com"
1,OH MY GOD THIS IS BAD!,"I could repeat what everyone else said, but I rather say a big 100% ditto. Do not by this DVD. The sound on the Chinese Connection warrents a Class Action Suit. I learned my lesson. Cheaper is not always better. I will just save up for the big Bruce Lee box set that has these movies in it."
4,ONLY GET WIDESCREEN VERSION!!!!,Unless you get the widescreen version (It has the nice packaging with the picture of Lee on the front tinted red)you are wasting your money because other versions are not formated for tv. Meaning you cant even see half of the cool fight scenes!!!I would have given this a 5 star rating except for the stupid and unneccasary sexuality.
1,Horrible Quality Video and Audio,Two of the best fighting movies ever destroyed by poor video and audio. All that is missing is the occasional cough by the person who may be holding the video camera in the theater. DVDs like this one really make one question the company who released it.
1,Absolutely horrid,"As others have said, the worst DVD I've seen. Not only were the transfers done from what appear to be film that was played so much it was scratched and broken, the audio is terrible. On ""Chinese Connection,"" it's too slow (makes everyone sound like a dying record player). Madacy is off the list; I sent them email to complain and never heard a word back. The CASE is worth more than this sorry disc!"
1,Good movie convered to poor quality,"This is the worst DVD I've seen. I've seen the movie before, and it was great. The quality of this DVD makes you not even want to finish the movie. The sound and picture quality is poor at best. I thought may be it was my copy, but apparently all copies from this company are like this."
1,THERE IS NOTHING FUNNY AT ALL,"THIS DVD IS A SPECIAL COMEDY VERSION OF THE BRUCE LEE CLASSIC ''THE CHINESE CONNECTION''. THIS VERSION, WHICH WAS RE-DUBBED BY LITTLE-KNOWN COMEDIANS, IS ABOUT AN O.G. WHO DECIDES TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST A RIVAL GANG. NOT ONLY DO I FIND THIS EXTREMELY UNFUNNY, BUT I ALSO FIND THIS OFFENSIVE. THERE IS NO WAY THAT THESE PEOPLE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DO THIS TO SUCH A GREAT MARTIAL ARTS FILM. IF THERE WAS ANY JUSTICE IN THE WORLD, LO WEI [IF HE'S EVEN STILL ALIVE] SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO SUE THESE COMEDIANS AND YORK ENTERTAINMENT FOR WHAT THEY DID TO THIS FILM. OH, AND PLUS, THE ORIGINAL ENGLISH-DUBBED VERSION OF THIS FILM IS ALSO ON THIS DVD, BUT I WILL WARN YOU, THE SOUND QUALITY IS PRETTY BAD. IF YOU WANNA SEE SOME COMEDIC TOUCHES ADDED TO CLASSIC MARTIAL ARTS FILMS THAT'S REALLY FUNNY, CHECK OUT ''KUNG FAUX'', WHICH COMES ON MUCH MUSIC."
2,Don't know what happened here,This was marketed as ''Bruce Lee's most violent film ever.''But I for one couldn't help but find it strangely boring.
2,Spectacular mess,"Somewhere inside the twisted, spectacular mess of ""Southland Tales"" is a decent film. Perhaps all that's necessary is a good editor to bring out the film that was clearly intended; one that's an over-the-top satire of 21st century life. In this world, porn stars, terrorists, politicians, cops, and A-list Hollywood actors often cross paths and form alliances on their way to fulfilling their various narcissistic agendas. They roam around, self-absorbed and self-unaware, grasping toward whatever decadent trinkets tickle their fancy, while the world is literally about to end.Unfortunately, somewhere along the way the entire thing just became muddled and incomprehensible. Which is a shame, because with the writer/director of Donnie Darko at the helm and a slew of varied talent in the film, it really could have been something great."
1,Horrible Mess,"As pretentious and messy as the film is, what's even worse is how boring it is. The cast is dead. The scenes move at a glacial pace. The attempted jokes land like bricks. It's an utterly unpleasant experience. Also, Kelly can bring up as many philosophical and political buzzwords as possible, but that doesn't mean he actually has anything to say about any of it. Very shallow and pointless film."
1,bleh,"What an awful follow up to the great Donnie Darko. I get it, its just not good. If you want to watch something strange and well done then watch a David Lynch movie."
2,southland tales,that was very strange movie and how they got all that stars to be in it i hope they got a lot of money for it. I like the action but it was strange.
2,Southland Tales = Bad,"Richard Kelly is an amazing writer and director, Donnie Darko is on of my favorite movies. He does some great films, but Southland Tales is just not one of them, I just thought the movie was confusing and kind of slow. Also I was expecting a great finish to the movie similar to Donnie Darko, but the ending was lame and just boring. All in all, I would say that this is one of Richard Kelly's worst films. It was ok to watch once but I do not see myself ever watching it again."
3,What the hell did I just watch?,"I watched this movie twice in a row because I thought I missed something the first time. I haven't watched it since, but I still have no real clue what the shit really happened in the movie. I just don't understand. Maybe I was tired and need to try seeing it again. I've just never walked away from a movie being so confused."
1,Please don't watch this movie!!!,"Finally, a movie which makes ""Battlefield Earth"" look like a 5 star production! How any director could take such a talented cast and have them show up day after day to appear in this mess is one for the books. Please ask to have any remaining copies of this video destroyed, the producers banned from financing any further sequels, and the writers sent to successfully complete re-hab."
3,Still trying to figure out whether I liked it or not!,"Eclectic film that I swear I still don't fully understand. Part satire, part thriller, part comedy, part everything. Multiple jumbled-up storylines keep you confused through most of it. Some of the visuals and individual scenes were cool, but I'm still not sure how I feel about the film overall. No real rating from me, until I can at least read some outside opinions to help me sort it all out."
1,Way...way..south,"You can not take style for substance. This film has a bunch of style, and some good points to it, but over all comes together like mating hummingbirds, everythings up in the air, something happens, you not sure what or why, and then poof...it's over.I would skip this one if I where you."
1,I'd rather eat dirt,"This movie was absolutely horrible. It is not only awful, but incredibly long. I would rather eat dirt then be forced to watch this movie again."
3,Knowing the real Southalnd helps - a lot,The mixed reviews are to be expected because you have to know about the real Southland to see the comedic spoofs. Sadly spoofing Los Angeles and convoluted political and sci-fi story are all that carry the first half of the movie. I would expect viewers not getting the jokes will move on. In the end I think it has a lot to offer but expect to be board if you haven't lived in Los Angeles county.
2,Southland Tales,"This was such an odd movie, I had to watch it several times to understand it. But Justin Timberlake--oh my! He made it all worthwhile."
1,Dismal is being polite,"Ok so if you like David Lynch this film will probably disappoint you. I find David Lynch films exceedingly dull. I find his work painfully obvious and try hard. It seems to be designed by a middle class school boy to shock the middle classes. Which I have been told it does. I recall getting so bored in ""Blue Velvet"" I walked out a quarter of the way thru and I can watch a goat herding film from Lebanon without blinking and consider Werner Herzog pacey. Imagine my surprise then when I found a film that was more tedious and even less interesting than Lynch. What a pity one cant give 0 stars."
2,"Can we please get ""propaganda"" included in the rating system?","Seriously.... Can we please get some kind of ""Propagana Warning"" incorporated into the rating system, please.......All the other positive ratings are going to result in me trying this thing again, (right now, in fact), but I'm not holding out much hope.When the opening sequence is talking about ""republicans"" and features a video shot of an elephant boffing another .... can it really go anywhere but down from there?????I'll try... but I'm not expecting much..."
1,Adolescent liberal dribble,"I should have paid more attention to the bad reviews on Amazon. I saw the trailer and thought, that looks good. Well, it lasted about 20 minutes in my DVD player before being ejected.It's anti-Bush. It's anti Iraq war. It's anti-Patriot act. It's got all the kook tyranny of goverment stuff that was constant and viral from the left about the Bush administration as a sub-plot... at least the first 20 minutes did. I couldn't watch another second. So maybe the rest of the movie is good?There should be a political warning label on movies like this... Warning, don't waste your money unless you are a moonbat liberal. Just my opinion... your mileage may vary."
1,2 hours of my life I will never get back,"Awful movie. Good cast, doing the best they can with a godawful script.. Don't waste your time with this one, don't even rent it..."
1,Horrible movie!!!,"I don't where to start, the terrible acting, the crappy storyline, the wacky settings, and I go could on and on. I really did not understand the point of the story, is something Neo-Marxism and George W. Bush, which he was a terrible president, the two so-called anti-heroes, Roland and Santarios, did not had originility. In order words, this movie was crap, totally crap!"
1,now my number all time stinky movie,it used to be lou ferigno in hercules..... this one takes the rotten stinky cake.... the only way you could like this movie is if you simply like to watch republicans attacked but its really done much better on huffington.... now that obama is in charge and the patriot act is stronger then ever and obama is about oil and globalism.... well this inane movie is just plain out of date..
1,"Yes, I understand the movie. Yes, it sucks.","I cannot believe someone financed this movie. It tries to borrow too much from Donnie Darko and tries too hard to blend it with Bible stories. Don't waste your time. It takes the mildly interesting parallel bubble universe idea from Donnie Darko and does a bad job of tying it to the Book of Revelations. There are some funny parts like the Killers video in the middle but it doesn't make up for the mountain of bad things. For example, ""I'm a pimp, and pimps do not commit suicide."" is the best line you can take from this movie."
1,I Feel Sad for the Actors,"God I wanted to love this movie. I like convoluted plots, I like obscure references, I like clever satire, I love Sarah Geller, and I like watching it all come together in the end .. but there was no satisfying ending to justify it all. Watching all the actors from 90s sitcoms and even SNL in this complete failure was just sad. I simply feel sad that some actors needed money and had to appear in this disjointed and ultimately not original movie. Rent it if u must, do not buy under any circumstances."
2,Kluge,"Some of the mismatched elements of this film are funny and clever. As a whole, the movie looks like a quilt of cameos, bits and unconnected ideas. Loved Danny Darko. This one is a stinker."
1,Wait... Donnie Darko is a 5* movie,"I've enjoyed movies likes this before, including Donnie Darko. Including Twin Peaks. The biggest distractions of this movie were (1) the glut of celebrities forgetting to play characters and instead were playing themselves and (2) the boring pace."
5,Dwayne Johnson!,"Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) actually is the most entertaining character in Southland tales. The movie is confusing because there appears to be over five main storylines all hapening at once. Each storyline seems to flash quickly from one to another without a good explanation. However, the ending is interesting as time travel is involved. Plus, Sarah Michelle Gellar looks very attractive as usual. I give this movie five stars not because of the storyline, but because of the excellent cast of actors."
5,Cult CLassic for those that don't need to 'Get it',"I read all of the 1 star reviews and most of the people seem fairly intelligent but a bit too serious. I found this movie highly enjoyable. Yes, the suspension bridge of disbelief is swaying like a feather in a hurricane, but who cares. It was all in good fun. It is incredulous that anybody could take this movie as pretentious, it is a COMEDY. Jeez. This is not a comparison to any of these movies, because I think it is quite different from these in many ways but if you eve remotely liked the big lebowski, repo man, idiocracy, fight club (a very funny movie), and yes even DR. STRangelove you might want to give it a chance and remember it isn't trying to make any grand statement. If you're into mainstream comedies starring that fat and unfunny idiot seth rogen, then this might not be for you."

1,"High hopes... however, dashed.","Southland Tales....what can one say but, WTF???? I had high hopes for this film considering the cast, but I was sadly disappointed. Kevin Smith was pretty cool for the 3 minutes he was in this (Great makeup, Kev!), but not worth the other 140+ minutes you'll waste watching this flick."
1,Waste of time...,"Has quite a few interesting innovation, but it is so stupid, I had to force myself to watch it and I could not even finish it."
1,baaaad,"I was excited to see this film. I really enjoy many of the actors but the film is terrible. It's nothing like the preview. It's very long, and very boring. I looked online to see how well it did in the box office because I wondered why I hadn't heard of it. It made approx 350 thousand dollars worldwide. Seriously, look it up."
1,0 out of 5 stars,"Watching this film was the biggest waste of 2 & a half of my life. It was plotless, and lackluster. The acting sucked, and nothing in the film was explained. I'm a big fan of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson's work in film but watching him in this film was an absolute disappointment. Maybe this movie was over my head, but even movies that go over my head can be explained. I can't begin to tell anyone what this movie is exactly about. I only gave this movie 1 star because my review wouldn't be viewed, otherwise I would have given it 0 stars."
4,a dab of darko to your diet,"there's no denying kelly has style. it sweats from every pore of this movie that may be less confused than most would think. it is in the opinion of this humble reviewer that richard kelly made exactly the film he intended to and it was brave of him to do so. a director need fight for his passions and stand his ground. though many appear to have ""figured the film out,"" i find it far less complex. the mass and confusion with the characters is merely a reflection of the stagnant state of our country at the moment. our television lacks morals, our teens misguided, our politics blackened. Kelly appears to have observed such things and though the movie can be confused with a well-constructed brain fart, i believe it takes minor logical thinking to see it for what it is. Kelly is a fresh voice and if it wasn't for the killers' song in the middle of the film, I would have given it five stars. i recommend it, as kelly has a sad beauty to all his films."
2,Bored?,"Only watch if U R Xtremely bored - and have not another thing in the whole video stratosphere 2watch other than this....I gave it a chance, but I will watch Troy for the 112th time B4 continuing to torture myself with this.. sighhh. I should not have even reviewed it. Just should have typed""no"""
1,So bad it's funny,"I don't write a lot of reviews but I literally just finished watching this and felt compelled to post something. This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm not exaggerating. The plot makes no sense and the acting was terrible. In one of the final scenes when Mandy Moore spontaneously starts dancing with Sarah Michelle Gellar on the ""super blimp"" I actually burst out laughing. I really liked Donnie Darko and was expecting it to all pull together in the end just like that film. Didn't happen. Just a confusing mess. It's free on Amazon Prime. I suggest you watch this movie because it's so bad it's actually funny."
2,It's not The Happening,"This movie has a wonderful plot, it is just falls apart left and right. I want to give it 1-star, but The Happening has that honor in my book. If it weren't for the plot, I would have given this movie 1 star.The movie certainly has its moments though, but goes on much too long (like some of its reviews here on Amazon).Southland Tales is what I use to compare a movie that has a good plot, but just isn't done ""right"" to a movie that isn't done right and simply has a really bad plot (the disaster of The Happening).If you are sitting at home trying to decide what to watch, and you have to decide between Southland Tales and The Happening, I can strongly recommend Southland Tales for your viewing pleasure. Otherwise, try something else."
1,this movie blows,"i have tried twice to watch this movie, and i couldnt make it through an hour each time. I dont know if the director wanted the actors to just phone it in or if it just happened, but i dont want to see shitty acting weather on purpose or accident. It wasnt funny. I wish i never would have bothered"
1,would not recomend,I did not like this movie at all. the language was terrible and was a waste of money. I throw in the garbage can
3,Interesting Video But...,"I do like that my favorite actors Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Justin Timberlake, and others are in it. However, I found the movie kind of confusing, corny, and irritating. I could not wait for it to end."
3,weird movie,Weird movie but the premise was good. As well as it was a good story a definate good buy if you are a fan of the darko series .
4,Gone Gone Gone-The Everly Brothers,"Gone gone gone is a good CD. Besides the title song, other worthy efforts are Ferris Wheel, Donna Donna, and Touture. The Facts of Life is a song written by The Everly's with great harmony and in conjunction with horns, reminds me of bag pipes at times....An interesting song!"
4,Collection of great songs from 71-72,"All original hits. The songs on this CD are all wonderful, considering their breadth of style. Song list (since it's not listed):1. Don't Pull Your Love - Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds2. Draggin' The Line - Tommy James3. Signs - Five Man Electrical Band4. Smiling Faces Sometimes - Undisputed Truth5. Do You Know What I Mean - Lee Michaels6. Scorpio - Dennis Coffey & Detroit Guitar Band7. A Natural Man - Lou Rawls8. Sweet City Woman - Stampeders9. Thin Line Between Love & Hate - Persuaders10. Have You Seen Her - Chi-LitesDon't Pull Your Love, Draggin' The Line, Signs, Do You Know What I Mean, Sweet City Woman all excellent pop tunes from the era, and big hits. Smiling Faces Sometimes, A Natural Man, Thin Line Between Love and Hate, Have You Seen Her all classic soul cuts. Scorpio is a great funky instrumental. Some of these songs are otherwise hard to find. I recommend this CD to anyone who likes great early 70s hit songs."
1,"Repackage, repackage and repacking again","70's Smash Hits 5 (Rhino 1993) and '70's Radio Hits Vol.5 (Rhino 1997) are the same album, track for track. Used, this Cd cost $4.81 more.Tricking the buyer makes fools of both parties. Hate this nonsense."
5,One of the best vampire movies I have seen,"Beautifully shot, well acted, well casted, amazing script. An amazingly inventive take on the vampire myth. The quality of the blu ray is amazing. Lots of special features."
4,Superb!,"Very entertaining, and very very original! The big American movie houses should take heed of moving films like this before they crank out their next big budget `standard issue` horror movie."
1,NOT in English,"Despite the languages information that Amazon lists on this item, it is not in English. The only audio is Spanish. You can watch it with the subtitles on, but be sure you are ready to ""read"" a movie before you buy it."
4,Good Film,Creative and interesting. Ron Perlman is in this film. I would watch before purchasing though. I own it on DVD
2,MEXICANS DON'T KNOW HOW TO END A FILM,"unfortunately this happens time and time again: mexican filmmakers hook you with an interesting premise, but then they don;t know where to go with it. The acting is good (Federico Luppi, the argeninian mel gibson as he takes a severe beating in every one of his films), but as we reach the end of the film, we are left hanging without a conclusion. Art? No; Fart. Rent it if you feel like wasting a few hours."
1,Complete rubbish,"Bad acting, predictable story, slow pace, nothing remotely horrifying or scary, not even its vaunted ""atmosphere"". This is third-rate and not worth your time, much less your money. Skip it."
1,Eternity is a long time...,"I hate dismissing a film without giving reasons why (I think it's lazy) but I have to confess that 'Cronos' managed to stupefy my critical facilities completely.I can't think of anything to say about it other than I found it utterly boring. Neither the story (which admittedly is intriguing for the first few minutes) nor acting nor actual film making engaged me on any level. Every half hour I'd glance at the clock wondering how much more there was to go... and discover only three minutes had passed since I last looked. It made me think of that Woody Allen quip: 'eternity is a long time... especially towards the end'.From other reviews I can see this film has its fans and to them all I can say is, sorry this didn't work for me."
3,Are you sure the DVD is not subtitled?,"That'd be a major mistake.Anyway, the ONLY scary 'vampire' film I've ever seen and a greataddition to the 'horror' genre.Ron 'The Hulk' Perlman in a pivotal role as the ""...beast?"" LOLS!Truly not to be missed.Hopefully it will be recognized again now that director Toro has released 'HELLBOY'.***(three stars) for the film. If the DVD is w/out subtitles know the stars are for the film only. The original acting shouldn't be ignored. Check the video stores for a subtitled version instead."
1,Waste of time,"Unfortunately this movie is a waste of time. It's not a horror, not even a thriller, but more of a dark drama shot in gloomy interiors.The storyline is very weak, the dialog is boring. The initial idea was good, but it was poorly implemented."
2,Don't bother,"Made in '97, in Mexico (which translates to roughly 1977 in Hollywood terms), this little diddy has two redeeming factors; Ron Perlman, and an original plot. Other than that I'm thinking why the hell did I see this.The story is not bad: 400 years ago an alchemist figures a way to cheat death by creating a device (cronos) with a little cookarocha in it among other mechanisms. A weathy (and dying) De La Guardia seeks the device after obtaining a manuscript with precise instructions on how to use it. It's another twist on the vampire theme. Boo."
1,What a stinker!,I couldn't find this film in the video stores so I bought a copy on the basis of the praise so may critics had for it. It was nearly unwatchable! I cannot believe this was considered an excellent film even as B grade films go.
2,See How They Grow: Sea Animals - For youngsters!,"Hi, I'm StoryMaker. Not too long ago we got See How They Grow: Sea Animals VHS from the library. It wasn't a hit, I must say. Both me and my mom found it very childish. Just listen to those animals' goofy voices ...definitely intended for youngsters. It seems like they are making it as least educational as possible. They even say hermit crabs are fish and I have no idea why! It's OK, but you'll probably find it pretty annoying if you are not very young. Overall, if you have a youngster interested in sea animals, then you could give it a try, but I think it would be better to check it out from the library than to own it. Signed, StoryMaker. ""Gotta trust the kid's review!"""
2,"""Not So Amazing""","Mr. Randi is probably the best known debunker of psychic phenomena. He enjoys his role, and doesn't limit his comments to just that type of phenomena, but also includes psychology, physics, and other individuals who might disagree with him. While it is true that humans cannot ""see"" around corners, and no person has been able to produce 'proof' of their abilities, there still remains the mystery of existence. As a matter of fact, the researchers at Princeton University, School of Applied Science, has verified an ""ultimate example"" of dreaming precognition. The details were forwarded to Dr. Robert G. Jahn's group PEAR. Dr. Jahn is the former Dean of the School of Applied Science. Brought to Randi's attention, he ignored this development. How many times in our history have we ignored another truth, because it didn't fit in with our ""world view."""
4,good deal,"I bought this book for my daughter in college. She was in a panic because she couldn't find some books needed for her Indian Lit class and the university bookstore was backordered. I paid a fraction of the price at the bookstore, received it in one day, and it was in perfect condition. The bonus-the university bookstore bought it back and she made a profit!"
3,Could have been SO much better.....,"Way too much yapping on this dvd for me (especially the promoters, fumbling with their notes onstage while yelling the most inane things). Too much gap between songs, and the quality is so-so. His one song on Reggae on the River (dvd) is better than any of the tunes on this one, unfortunately. I wouldn't recommend it, but I still watch it from time to time."
2,Dot's Review,"To me, this book was far too long for the plot. I became so bored just waiting for something to happen that I quit the book right in the middle; skimmed to the end to see who the killer was. The plot would have been a good one had she not drug it out so long."
2,this book is similar to a book titled a Tangled Web,"enjoyed the boook, but it was to similar to the above mentioned book titled Tangled web"
2,The most unbelieveably unbelieveable book ever written,"This book truely is Danielle Steele. However, I found it to be one of her most preposterous works to date. The story of the two sisters intrigued me and I was not disappointed with the differences protrayed by the twin characters. On the other hand, I haven't read a Danielle Steel book in quite a while. Possibly, I have learned that the dreamy romances she depicts do not exist in the real world."
3,"Danielle Steele is ""losing it""!","This book takes hours of reading to even get to anything remotely interesting or to move the plot along. Steele says the same thing over and over (I even found myself saying out loud ""you already said that!""). I've had the feeling that she's ""losing it"" by trying to grind out too many books in too short a time. The last book of hers I picked up (The Klone and I) was so ridiculous that I didn't even finish reading it! Usually I look forward to her new books with great anticipation. Come on, Danielle...get with it!"
5,Entertaining beginning...stalls in the middle...good ending,"Like most of her work, Steel pulls the reader in with an intriguing storyline. Unfortunately, she blathers on wayyyy too long with the conflict Victoria/Olivia have with the 'switch'. She could have skipped about 200 pages in the middle of this epic. Once the twins finally do take the 'no turning back' switch it gets good again. Overall, great read, good history, well developed characters."
4,Enjoyable,I'm not the biggest Danielle Steele fan because I think a lot of her work is sappy and predictable. This is the second time that I read Mirror Image and will probably read it again. Though the story line is far fetched it is enjoyable. This book was a page turner.
3,"Enjoyable reading,also I can relate as I have twin girls",Was an enjoyable book without any profanity.Nice read which i have passed on to friends (twins)
3,"Interesting, but too long!","I have enjoyed Danielle Steel's books for many years ,but I must say that this one is NOT one of her best. It took way too long for that ""meat and potatoes"" of the story to come along and by then I was almost exhausted. The only thing that was interesting to me was that the setting for this book(Croton, NY) took place 3 miles from where I live!"
3,"Somewhat entertaining, rather predictable","I have read better Danielle Steel & I have certainly read worse. I guess I enjoyed this book but I found that as usual, the author repeats herself constantly (we get the point already!) or she takes an entire paragraph to say what could be said in one sentence. However, I found myself wondering when the twins would break the news to Charles about the switch & how he would react. I suppose I would recommend this for casual reading."
4,Imagine having the opportunity to switch lives....,"with someone else. Well, that is possible for the twins in this story. Set in the time of WWI, two sisters change their lives and learn, not only about their sister, but about themselves. The wild, outgoing, daring sister compared to the settled, at-home, calm sister learn the differences in life. It was one of the better Steel books that I have read."
5,Danielle Steel's Perfection,"This book reminds me of a wonderfully crafted symphony. It had a great blend of adventure, romance, lust, love lost, new beginnings, regret and want. I read it in eight hours, I couldn't put it down. The characters were developed to perfection, and while some things were quite cliche, like of course Victoria was on the Lusitania, the story was original. It described the myseterious relationship between twins perfectly and it was just an amamzing book."
5,Great Story About Life As Twins,"This is my first Danielle Steel's book. I don't usually read romance novels but the write-up looked interesting. I was so impressed with the story line that I found it difficult to put down. The story seeemed so real that I felt as if I was there. Granted, that there was repitition describing the twins relationship and their physical appearance. I found that annoying, but if you get passed that the book is worth reading."
2,Don't waste your money,"This is a poor shaver. You have to go over the same spot over & over before it cuts. I tried to return it, but the seller wouldn't accept returns."
2,Worst Braun I've owned,"I've used Braun electrics for 30 years, this is the worst one. The trimmer doesn't work, and the shaving is slow. It does do a decent job of shaving, and the price is reasonable."
2,Solid Build Quality but why cant it shave like good?,"I have this one as a spare at work when I need to make a good impression and get rid of 5 o clock shadow. I only used it 2-3 times per week. It pales in comparison to the Panasonic shavers which makes is 2 or 3 times better. I bought this as my main shaver at first than found a screaming deal on ebay on a Panasonic Shaver. The only reason I kept the Braun was I was past my 30 day refund policy. Its ok for a spare, its got a nice case, is light and the ac plug is dual voltage. Just want to let people know that this is a poor to fair shaver imho. Others have loved it, so make sure you keep your receipt and buy from a place that offers easy exchange or refund."
4,Braun 5885,"I have been a Braun user for a very long time. My new razor gives you a great close shave. My only problem is the redesign of the trimmer, it used to be a 90 degree trimmer now it not making it harder to use on mustaches and beards."
1,Braum Series 3370 Men's Shaver,"Sad to say , I used the shaver for two weeks. After each shave I had to use my Norelco 5825XL to get a good shave . I'm sorry I bought it . NO STAR ."
2,below average,This electric razor is not as good as my Norelco. In order to get a good shave I have to use the Norelco to finish after I use this razor.
2,"Loud, slow to cut.","Everyone's facial beard is different I know, so I will try not to cut the product on the basis that it did a poor job of cutting my tough beard. But if you can stand the very loud noise of the motor and the heavy vibration that more or less gives you a facial message, then this is the razor for you. It charges fast and holds a charge for a long time. The Braun today is not the same as it was a few years ago. My last Braun was about twenty years ago and I loved it. I can't say the same for this one. But again everyone's face is different."
5,love it!!,"Finally decided to replace my 1st Braun shaver (system 1-2-3 purchased in 1993 and still going after only 1 new battery plus a few cutter/foil replacements). This one is so much nicer! It's quieter, closer and faster. The big test was a 3 day stubble which it handled without complaint. Not sure the swivel head does anything, though. Shaving is a pleasure again."
3,Okay Shaver,"I purchased this shaver because I had parts to fit it left over from another Braun that died. It does an acceptable job, but does not do well in the soft parts of the neck - but then, most others don't either. I had trouble getting used to the trimmer as it has to be used on the end instead of the side like most others. I like that I can rinse it - that saves a lot of brushing. Like most Braun items it is high quality. I'm generally pleased with it."
3,Product is so-so. Shipping sucked,"SHIPPING SUCKED ON THIS PRODUCT!!!!!! Ordered this product back in May. It shipped May 30th, and didn't arrive until June 10th. Don't know what they did with it for 11 days. I was so displeased with the shipping that once I got the product, I didn't really care. It seems to work decent. Sideburn trimmer is sorta awkward."
3,Can't compare with blades,Tried again and again. The best I can get is comparable to one trip after blade: no wonder why Braun added an insert asking how many miles I had to spend on this thing.
1,Lousy Shave,The foil is abrasive and can cause razor bumps.Also the shave is not close and will missed areas around my rear jaw line that my Remington gets fairly easily.Overrated and overpriced eurotrash.
2,lackluster performance,"I bought both the model 370 and 550 close together. Now that three plus months have gone by, I would definitely NOT recommend the model 370 and ony conditionally the model 550. The 550 is over-priced, while neither model gives a close shave compared to the Norelco quadra head I bought more than a year ago. I end up using the Norelco to finish up after the Brauns. I am unable to get a reasonably close shave with the model 370 and just barely with the model 550. I suspect the heads clog up with whisters as you shave and this affects the shave. I wanted to try a Braun after years of using a Norelco or Panasonic(a joke). I will stick with the Norelcos and consign the Brauns to the dresser drawer as a bad choice and a waste of money. Spend a little more and buy a good Norelco. Your face will thank you for it."
2,Very disappointed!,"For the money, I was expecting a very good shaver! What I got was a very expensive lesson. The shaver was very quiet and comfortable in the hand but lousy for getting a close shave. After repeated passes over my beard, I still had stubble's. I took my travel shaver ($15.00 at Walgreen's) and completed the shave leaving a smooth, stubble-less feel. Don't spend the money on this shaver."
2,Returned the item,"I purchased it on 02/04/2009. I used it for 2 weeks. It shaves ok except neck. I couldn't shave my neck sucessfully even with lots of effort. I followed all the best practices written in instruction guide. As I had to use the shaver with the combination of regular razor, I decided to return it.I do not recommend this product."
4,Braun Seroes 3 370 Review,"Seems to be a good razor. Easy to handle, clean shave, easy to pack for a trip. Charge does not last as long as I would like but everything else is great for the price I paid."
5,Works great,"I bought this shaver for my boyfriend as an upgrade from his previous Braun that was starting to die on him. The last one served a very long life but was no longer doing it's job. He loves the new one. It's easy to clean, shaves in fewer strokes than the last one did when it was new and holds a charge much longer than it's predecessor...which is great for a guy on the go."
2,Braun 3 370 Shaver,"This is the best electric shaver I have ever owned. It has worked flawlessly: smooth, close shave; reliable long charge; my face has adjusted to it. Everything is a positive as advertised. It has far exceeded my expectations. Five stars."
1,Braun Shavers Quality,"I had a Braun Series 5 ""system"", after about two weeks it started sounding like a buzz saw, and the shave wasn't as good. I used it for about a year and gave up on it. then I bought a Series 3 ""system"" and have had it about 6 months. Sometimes the cleaning stand won't shut off. Sometimes the shaver won't turn on. Sometimes even after a few days, when I go to shave, the battery is dead. The quality of the shave is great, but I think either their manufacturing or engineering sucks, they have no web access for problems, you have to take it to an authorized dealer (about 30 miles from me), and apparently don't want any feedback from customers. It seems that since Gillette bought Braun things went to hell. I doubt if I'll ever buy another Braun, and it's too bad, because the shave is really great when it does work."
1,Smooth but can't tackle a tough beard,"The shave unit is certainly smooth, but it can't tackle a tough beard. I still need to finish with a razor. The trimmer unit is junk at best. For the price this product is no better than a cheap Braun Shaver."
4,Quality Braun product,"I previously owned a Braun foil shaver (circa 1980's) and it worked faithfully until a few months ago when it just died of old age. I am sold on Braun quality and did a lot research before buying the Series 3 370. It is very similar to my old shaver but with some nice amenities like being washable and not needing to be recharged quite as often. The tilting shaver head follows the contour of my face. The shave is very close to a blade shave. All in all, I am completely satisfied with my purchase."
3,Series 3 370 Braun,Razor lacks a good carrying case. Lacks a protective removal cap on the head. Otherwise has performed as well as my previous Braun razor.Replacement heads and cutter blocks are extremely expensive.
3,No good on curly hair,"In spite of what they say, it does not do well on my curly beard, especially if several days old. Not as good as the rotary type ones. Other that that, a very nice razor."
1,Worst Braun Shaver I ever owned,"I have owned many electric razors and of late I have been purchasing Bruan's. I seem to go thru an electric razor every 3 years or so. My last 3 razors have been Braun's thus this is my forth. I bought it because of the many postive reviews and because I was totally satisfied with my previous Braun razors. Not any more. This razor just does not shave. It a very solid built razor, thus out of the package I was pleased. But after the first shave I was not happy. I have been using it for 4 months now, I even changed the foil and blades as I bought extras when I made my original purchase. Still a very poor shave. I have been using my blade razor most of the time and only use the Bruan for a quick touch up. I am now reviewing which razor to go to next. I may buy a high end Braun but I hate to spend that kind of money and end up with the same results. I would not recommend this razor to anyone."
4,Real work horse of a shaver,"I can put it this way it, Does a great job of shaving and cleans super easy. This might not annoy others but the motor vibrates very hard and its not the most comfortable thing to hold when you shave. Overall this is a GREAT shaver for the price. I have never tried the 150 dollar shavers so who knows I might be missing out!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"high expectation, low performance","Owned braun shavers most of my life... really enjoyed previous models performance until this one. Positive - the shaver charges fast and it is light. Now the negatives. It does not shave evenly especially around the corners of the chin. Also the trimmer is absolutely horrible - it failed to trim much at all and if it does, catches hair and tug on it. Would not recommend at it."
1,Disappointed no close shave at all.,"I bought this on the recommendation of other users here. It was a replacement for my $29.95 Norelco rotary shaver. After using for a month it misses lots of whiskers, is noisy and has loud vibrations. This is similiar to wet dry Panasonic shavers I had before. In comparison, I Norelco is super quiet, no vibrations, 3 heads have more shaving surface, closer shave and has reserve to hold all your cut whiskers. Your whiskers fall out with the Braun. Braun get your act together. German's are suppose to make well designed products!"
1,Pirates of the ....Jungle?,"Harold's jungle is a lot different from mine. I recognized 4 out of 11 animals by shape: a lion, a crocodile, a giraffe and an elephant. I also recognized a crown, a palm tree, and a man one one knee aiming his rifle. I also thought I saw a ghost. By looking at the picture in the box I identified the ghost as a toucan sitting on a branch, a monkey hanging by one arm from a branch with one arm and two legs dangling and only a bump for a head (impossible to recognize by the shape, as are all the rest of the figures). A boy hanging on to a branch, a jeep (for the hunter, I guess) and the pirate ship from the title of my review. The set is mini for sure, but the theme was not appropriate. Surely there are more jungle animals than the six in this set, two of which are unrecognizable by shape alone. Very disappointing!"
4,Hip-French-Hop!!!!!,"Esta Banda de origen francesa nos presenta en esta magistral cd la potencia musical que han desarrollado su pais, Nuevos y originales loops, scrachs, y una secuencia de voz que vale la pena admirar.Este cd tiene que estar en cualquier cd-case de los amantes de el hip hop, pues programme satifacera toda exigencia, y complacera el oido de los mas exigentes."
4,Works well but needs extra support,I found that it worked well however I needed to add wood to mount it because it was not long enough and will not center on two studs. After that adjustment it is great. I bought two of them
4,Solid Little Rack,"This rack is very ideal for people with limited space. I currently have it hanging in the corner of my dining room. It is very sturdy. My only complaint, if you can even call it one, was that it was slightly dirty out of the box. Other than that, it's great. Because of stud placement, I had to mount a 1x3 behind the actual rack. I have the 1x3 mounted to 3 studs, and the rack mounted to the 1x3 in 2 places. So far, with this setup, the rack has been holding a ~35lb commuter hybrid and a ~18-19lb road bike without issue."
4,Great product,"Great bike rack. Holds small or large bikes plus the little racks for the helmet/shoes are great. Plenty of hardware for drywall or stud-mounting. Easy and sturdy. Would buy another if I got an ""open box deal"" again. Otherwise, it is a touch pricey."
2,Great movies but beware defective disc,At least some of the discs containing The Beyond are defective. I have returned one set and recieved another and it also has its problems. It doesnt like to load or read once loaded. If you monkey with it enough it will play. As for the movies themselves i cannot seem to get enough of them. The music as well as visual is very captivating. Hopefully Anchor Bay will do a recall on the defective product. Perhaps buying the movies seperatly would be a better option.
3,Interesting but lets be realistic,"""The Beyond"" is worth seeing for the sake of enjoying a fulci film but ""dawn of the dead"" or ""reanimator"" `ish` it ain't. I found myself reaching for the FF button after sitting though gratuitous spider biting fu (yes, that is like joe bob would call it). Other scenes warrented similar actions. People need to know that the ""feel"" of these movies is very late seventies night at the movies made for tv. Many people know this already, but I was one that did not and no review spoke of this fact. Beware fans of reanimator/dawn of the dead/make them dieslowly/necromantic/buried alive/dead alive/bad taste/ to name a few of the must buys.Cemetery was much better, immediate nudity, great gore, annoying kid getting exposed to great gore, no FF button needed. The whole movie flowed better. check this one out first."
5,Great product,"This is a great paint for doing your painting, such as for painting rocks with other earth tone colors for a train layout such as I have."
5,Important Look at Ignored Subject,"This is an eye-opening look at our increasing ""thanatocracy"" (Greek for ""the rule of death""). With the ethic of ""quality of life"" riding high in America, Smith makes us confront some deeply troubling trends that seldom come up in serious conversation, because the issues involved have a high ""yuck"" factor, not unlike abortion. This book should be must reading for all medical ethicists, HMO executives, and legislators. It is not simply a matter that high-tech medicine generates more ""dilemmas"" over the care of the acutely or terminally ill. Increasingly, Smith shows, there is acceptance of devaluing human life, the veritable shredding of the historic Hippocratic Oath. This slippery slope points down a steep hill with no discernable bottom."
3,Doesn't work on all TV's!!!,I wanted to use this on my TV in my bedroom to help wake me up in the mornings. I have a Magnavox tube type TV that is maybe 5 years old. This clock would work perfectly the first time but then it would never work again unless it was programmed a second time. Then it would work just that one time again. I tried it on my Vizio flat screen in the living room and it worked perfectly every time. So it really depends on what TV you use it on. You program it with the TV remote itself so I'm not sure why it refuses to work more than once on my Magnavox.
4,Remore alarm,Our TV will not come on via the TV timer. This product has no problem in doing it for us. Our bedroom TV now wakes us every morning. It was no problem to configure it to control the TV.
3,Not a Bad Summer (albeit short) Collection,"This Flashback collection from Rhino gathers up 10 summer fav's, doubling up on both the Beach Boys and The Surfaris. For the most part Golden Summers stays in the early 60's except for the early 70's side by Mungo Jerry.The usually exceptional Rhino sonics are not quite as profound on the budget line ""Flashback"" series. Evidently Rhino staff engineer Bill Inglot does NOT remaster these and frankly it shows a little."
4,even high schoolers loved this book ...,"... because it affirms the way they believe they think and act.. at least that is what they told me when I proposed Gary's book to five classes of senior (restless minds) then had lively discussions with them through which I found that most had, indeed, read it... and as they get older, with more experience under their belts, they may need to be reminded of these tools. Also read Howard Raiffa, (e'st al) book, Smart Decisionmaking. - Kare Anderson, SmartPartnering"
5,Worth reading,"If you are looking for anwsers about decision making, so dont through this book. But if you want to learn about this topic, there is no better place to go, get a copy and enjoy!"
3,A classic in its field!,"Sources of Power, How People Make Decisions, is a classic recommended in some courses on decision making. It offers a number of valuable insights as to how people reach decisions in practice, questioning the validity of some rational decision making models in situations where time pressure is high. It is a good and thoroughly enjoyable read."
4,Frommer's Chicago with Kids,"I am a Frommer's fan! If you already have the recent Frommer's Chicago, then you may find much of the information in this book a tad redundant.The book tackles topics pertinent to families: prices, facilities, times when families will feel most welcome, etc...I am very happy with my purchase and will pursue other Frommer's products in the future."
5,This Tha Shiiiit!,"Tela go hard! If u don't know Tela, pick this up anyway. This CD is the best thing to come out in the last 6 months fa sho! Take this advice, everyone can't be wrong. Tela is a diamond in the south!"
4,are yall still sleeping???,"ever since tela left suave house its like no one is feeling him..but this album is real good. tela sticks to the script and lets u know why he one of the most slept on artist. what i like about the album is it has a radio friendly feel to it without being out of touch with the streets. he reminds me of a southern jay-z, because of his flow and how he can make ""complete"" songs. he has some good guest artist, but not to many, which is good. so give him a chance, trust me if u like good old fashion pimpin' rhymes this is the one. (he'll make too short so proud.)"
4,Beneficial,The publishing of both Sun Tzu's and Sun Pin's jointly creates an important investment in thought. I've discovered that all of this particular interpretation is also quite easy to follow and the reviews benefit us greatly along with the interpretation. The majority of these acts signify amazing thoughts on the kinds of fighting styles
1,Art Of War,"I greatly enjoy reading what Sun Tzu says, however I could really live without the author giving me his two cents. I am pretty able to figure out that when Sun Tzu advises to collect supplies along the way it means you should gather food and other resources along the way. I don't need this guy telling me that."
1,suffering,The text does not remotely fill the entire page to lengthen the book and suggest a happier price. Sun Pin's addition is severely garbled because the original text was damaged and it's contadictory. The most likely reason that Sun Pin's methods were forgotten and preserved only in a tomb was because (GEE GOLLY) people believed it wasn't worth reading. The commentary uses the word obvious extremely often among various other uneeded lengthening exercises.The author describes himself as an imaginative entrepenuer.(Sun Tzu flirts with perfection)
4,My three year old won't sleep without it,"My three year old LOVES this cuddly flashlight. She sleeps with it every night. I actually have to buy a new one because the dog has destroyed hers. We love the fact that it shuts off after 30 minutes. Once she falls asleep, it doesn't stay on all night."
4,For Christian Science Fiction Lovers!,"If you've enjoyed Star Wars and the Left Behind series, you'll love Exile! The hero of this new series is Mathias who is chased around galaxies by the fierce conquerors, the Sorlum. It's a fast-paced, quick read that will spark your day. It has a right-on Christian theology within its science fiction boundaries and will be tough to put down before the last page is read."
2,It's just not there.,"She has an amazing voice and no one can take that away from her. She needs to work on her music writing however...an upbeat song on this CD would be a nice addition. This is not driving music by far. Her lastest single (not on this CD) ""Everything But You"" is a remarkable song and it shows how talanted she is and that she has a bright future if she can stay on target with more songs to follow that one."
5,The book is also pretty funny sometimes ...,"I forgot to mention in my lengthy review below that one of the best properties of Baseball Prospectus 2002 is the humor ... it adds to the readability a lot knowing that some funny and off-the-wall statements crop up in the player comments. I inadvertantly found myself up way past my bedtime recently reading about minor-leagues for the Tigers when I hit this note on Brandon Inge: he ""does less damage at the plate than Lara Flynn Boyle"". Good stuff. Keep it up, boys."
1,BROKE IN 3 DAYS,"Not only did it break in 3 days, but it died by turning bright red and smelling and vibrating. it was a very scary thing to have close to my head.I will be writing the company next.I could go on about the product, how the comb is too sharp and the med and high buttons blew the same, but I think it's far more important for people to know this model is a DANGER.Please AVOID.It needs to be recalled."
5,"GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT PRICE!","GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT PRICE. You just have to expect the arrival time to be at a snail's pace if you live on the West Coast."
5,Vidal Sassoon VS540 Professional Styling Hair Dryer,"Product arrived as described. Price was good, the Vidal Sassoon VS5540 hair dryer works as well as their former model and happy to have it."
5,Vidal Sassoon VS540,I love this hair dryer. It is the only one that works very well for 3 years. I haven't had a lot of problems with it. It dries my hair very fast when I set it on high. I think the replacement comb doesn't break that easily because mines lasted for almost 2 years without having the comb follicles break.
4,Good Hair dryer but not made to last,"I have had three of these hair dryers over the years and like the way they dry my hair even though they do not hold up well. I use the comb attachment to straighten the waves for a smoother look. It is best not to use this dryer on the high setting or it will tend to overheat and shut off on you. Also, the comb attachements break easily and I need to replace them about every two months. This time when I ordered a new dryer, the first one I received was defective. It made a terrible shrieking noise and vibrated so much I could hardly hold it in my hand. It also had a burning smell. I sent it back and ordered another one. It works fine."
1,screaching and overheating hairdryer!,"This is the worst hairdryer I have ever owned. I might have a defective one, but it makes the most horrible screaching sound when you turn it on AND it overheats in less than 3 minutes. I do not recommend buying it. I would return it, but I no longer have the packaging and my receipt. Don't buy this item."
1,Do not buy this product,"This hair dryer has other reviews that are the same as mine. Do not buy this product, the quality is bad. Mine only lasted for three uses and it broke. Many other people have had the same experience. Why the vendors keep selling this is a mystery. It is crap."
4,Styling Comb Makes the Difference!,"This is the only hairdryer that works to style my fine, limp hair, & I'm frustrated that more hairdryers are not modeled after this one. I have not seen one in stores for years, so it was great to find it available online."
4,Light and breezy ;-),"This is not a heavy duty hair dryer, but it has different speeds and it has a brush and comb attachment that I like. Not a bad product. It's a bit noisy, but then so are all hairdryers."
1,Overheating nightmare!,"I usually use Conair products but decided to try something new. Bad choice! The hairdryer overheats 4-5 times per blowdry. You have to turn it off and wait about 3-5 minutes for it to cool down in order to use it again. I'm also not a huge fan of the attachments. When I use the brush attachment, my hair doesn't really stay in the brush. The force of the dryer blows my hair out of the way so it's essentially useless.Go for the Conair!!!"
3,It's Not That Bad for a Cheap Blow Dryer,"I got this because it was cheap and decent looking. It does the job, maybe not as good as the more expensive ones, but dry hair is dry hair... The teeth in both combs start falling out after a couple uses, but it still dries. Not the best, but not the worst either."
4,easy listening,I saw the WYRD SISTERS in Marquette Mi. at the music festival (Hiawatha). They're even better live. The band had such a great energy we couldn't leave until their last set was over. I would recommend them to anywone.
3,A book like candy,"Beautifully packaged book (at least the red version is) and fun to read, despite the fact Konig's funny-bossy tone sometimes veers into pure brat, which is annoying. The disappointment in this book is that you can merrily read through a whole amusing chapter only to find at the end of it that you're learned almost nothing. More subtance, Rita! Still loved the book, though - it's one to go back to again and again to be cheered up, when life just seems too routine."
1,Bad Right Out Of The Package !!!,Terrible experience with this tomato tower. Bought three and had to retie 2 of them where the plastic nibs had disintegrated. The third one the netting was not even attached to the plastic ring at all - defective right out of the package. I will never buy this again!
3,"Okay book, but not what I was looking for","Overall, I think the book had good information about things you need to know when raising a special needs child. I was disappiointed however that it did not have more real life stories about moms of special needs children. It had quotes but did not have in-depth stories. I enjoy reading more about how other moms are balancing raising a special needs child and working and raising other children etc. The information was okay, however most of it I already knew about. I don't know what I was expecting or wanting. I think I was wanting more stories about moms balancing life rather than just ""how to""information. Again, it was okay, but not what I was hoping it would be."
1,The MGM glory-days!,"Count the number of dancers in those spectacular dance sequences. It is amazing. Every student at Tate College must have danced in them. The ""Pass That Peacepipe"" and final ""Good New"" numbers I have on constant re-run, never tire of seeing them."
4,Quel fromage!,"I adore this movie! The best pairing of June Allyson and Peter Lawford since ""Little Women"", in my mind (I saw ""Little Women"" first and fell head over heels for Lawford's Laurie). Anyway, the best scenes, in my opinion, are the French Lesson and when Connie (Allyson) figures out just how posh Pat McClellan is (hence, quel fromage, instead of quel domage). And fabulous tunes sung as only Mel Torme could sing 'em! Fabulous dance numbers, even if dated (""Pass the Peace Pipe"" for one). And many pre-WWI references (""the bees knees!"") But overall, great bobby-soxer, co-ed college fun. This is a pre-Rat Pack Lawford flick when he and Frank Sinatra were the idols at MGM. Silly throughout, but purly entertaining! Love it!"
5,The best movie ever,"This movie is one of my personal favorits of all time. It has great acting, wonderful songs/music, and very entertaning dance numbers. The first time I ever saw this movie on TV I ran to the nearest place to rent it. And soon after I got one of my own so I could watch it again and again. I strongly suggest you do the same! You won't regret it."
4,Good News is slated for re-issue as a Warner Archives title later this year.,"I don't know what (if any) extras there will be, but Good News has been announced as a release from the Warner Archives Collection, the WHV manufacture on demand line. I own quite a few of these and I've had no problems playing them on either my PC or in either DVD player I own.Good News is now available from Warner Archives.I just got the WAC re-release of this and it has the same extras as this version, also with a scene selection menu. It's probably a straight transfer of this release."
5,Great Literature,"Great homeschool book for history, literature or both. Age appropriate for the Middle School Student (7th or 8th). Easy to understand and follow. Liked the sub-sections - helps to go back and reference. Highly recommend."
4,Typical Gibbons writing style,"This is my third Gibbons book. I have loved them all. Even though they were all written in the 1960's the information contained inside remains very interesting and entertaining. I would highly recommend all three of them. I did, however, enjoy ""Stalking the Wild Asparagus"" and ""Stalking the Wild Herbs"" more than this one. If you can only buy one, I'd recommend ""Stalking the Wild Asparagus"" as my first choice."
1,Worst Book in a Long Long Time,"This is one of the worst books I have read in recent memory. Hyden has very little personal opinion, book reads like a glossary of footnotes of other writers on the subject. Examples are infrequent, and where present, poorly explained or analyzed. More space is devoted to the writings of Marx than actual events which happened in Africa."
3,"Improvement, but still lacks great plot","When Sylvester Stallone started work on ""Rambo 3"" he was at the height of his career. He was coming off of ""Rocky 4"" and ""Cobra.""I believe Stallone wanted to make a Rambo film that deals with the Middle East, since the two previous films were set in either America or Vietnam.""Rambo 3"" begins with Col. Trautman searching for Rambo in Thailand. Trautman witnesses him stick fighting and follows him to where he works in a Buddhist Temple. The reason why Trautman is pursuing Rambo is because he is going into Afghanistan to help bring supplies and weapons to Afghan Rebels. Rambo decides not to go saying ""It's got to end for me sometime.""In Afghanistan, Russians capture Trautman's team. Word gets back to Rambo, and he decides to go on a rescue mission to save Trautman.Overall, ""Rambo 3"" is better than the sequel, but still lacks the great story that ""First Blood"" had."
2,"Stallone's ""Other"" Movie icon Character","This is another predictable action adventure by Stallone's other movie icon, John Rambo. Genre afficienados will eat it up, but casual movie fans may find it a little tedious to anyone but action enthusiasts. Stick with Rocky..."
4,WOW! IGNORE ALL 1 STAR RATINGS!,"First of all this movie is not pro-Taliban or pro-Al Qaedamany people on here hate on this movie because Rambo joins the ""Taliban""... This is very laughable because those people were Mujahadeens if you didnt know there are 3 different ethnic groups in Afghanistan Tajiks(Who were in the movie) Hazaras(Mongoloid people) and Pashtoons(Talibans) these people in here assume that just because u are an afghan trying to defend ur country against the russians you are a ""terrorist"" or ""taliban"" its also funny because this movie was set in the 1980's Taliban wasnt even formed until the 1990's. JUST SHOWS HOW STUPID SOME PEOPLE ARE. AND HOW IGNORANT! SHAME ON YOU!"
2,no man will become rambo,"This is just a movie, a reminder for those of you who take rambo and speak of rambo as a real life person, this movie based on previous two, which were really successfull in us and europe, soif hollywood can cash in on it, you got rambo 3. this movie is not to be taking seriously, i say hot shots part deux is more serious then this movie, this movie gives what it meant to give one man violent entertainment.this movie is for that special night with your girlfriend, cheap fun, unless you thing your girlfriend will want man like rambo, instead of you, then get something else, but just remember movie is a movie, how many men were fooled by it and became soldiers to look like rambo and impress females, then realizing, too late, that in real life it is totally different, and no amount of training will protect anyone from unexpected bullet, don't be fools, real war is much, much worst and not a cheap hollywood entertainment you could turn off when you tired of violence..."
2,The worst,"Don't get me wrong, I like bad movies. I watch all the Freedy Krugers, and Dumb and Dumber, Ace Venturas, Tromas, ect. But this one is awful. The worst! Especially to see it now! You expect to see Bin Laden show up to shake Rambo's hand. Now that we know that Rambo and Trautman put el Quaida and the Taliban in power, I generally root for the Russians! Yes, it's that BAD! And the worse part is, it's true, America did do this, and now our guys are back there fighting the same evil that faced the Russian boys. Will Rambo go back?"
1,GARBAGE..,"""FIRST BLOOD"", based on David Morrell's book, is already a classic, well conducted and convinvent. But after that, the John Rambo character acquired a life of his own in the hands of Hollywood, and the sequels RAmbo II and III sucks, showing Stallone at the lowest level of interpretation an acting and screenplay of his career. Avoid it!"
1,zero stars for Rambozo,"Part III is so horrible in so many ways that you can't help but learn from it, but inversely and backwardly. Were people even dumber in the 80s? I think on a cultural level, without a doubt. In anycase, Rambo maybe deserves a half star as a fabulous demonstration in Right-Wing Hollywood propaganda. But today you can watch FOX News and observe how this type of propaganda is created and spread. A funny thing though is that the first RAMBO is a good movie. I love it. It is actually good, as hard as that is to remember now. Did you know that in the book (the original film is based on) Rambo's commanding officer shoots him in the head at the end?"
2,"Makes Rambo II look like ""Apocalypse Now""","This is one silly film. It has such daft gunfights that you long for the realism of Buck Rogers.Passes the time, don't expect luxuries like plot or characters, though.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
2,PART 3 IS NUMBER 2 ! 2 STARS IS GENEROUS!,The third installment of Rambo isn't any better than part 2! It is a comic book action movie with wooden performances and ridiculous situations. I give it 2 stars because.....I guess it is watchable nonsense? The DVD special edition is way better than the movie deserves.
1,One of the worst war movies I've ever seen,"This movie was an embarrasment to the filmmakers. First of all, extremely unrealistic- Rambo shoots a few bullets at a Soviet helicopter and it explodes like a toy. Second, this film is very boring- for about 45 minutes, Rambo and his Afghan friends walk around with angry faces and discuss how awful the Russians are.Third, I wonder why do Americans always hit their targets and Russians always miss?"
1,They'll Be Pulling This Title Out of Their Dustbins,"They should have stopped the Rambo series after the first movie. The movies get worse with each subsequent release. The most ridiculous scene was when Rambo and Trautman decided to take on the entire Soviet Army by themselves. What hogwash! Apparently, only Americans can shoot straight, while the Soviets could never get in a good shot."
2,Good Picture-Poor Audio,"The Picture was an upgrade from DVD, but the sound was terrible on all but the latest Rambo. I wanted to upgrade all of the series, but I had to turn the sound up alot to even get a decent quality. I have great equipment, all of the new sound upgrades, with large tower 3-way speakers and 100 watt subs in all 4 of the towers.If I had the option again, I would pass."
4,"john, john rambo","big fan of stallone and of the rambo series, sly doesn't disappoint here. with his back to the wall he is forced to take on an entire russian division, no problem. well worth your time if you are a fan."
2,Enough with the Russian translation Sub-titles,"Whoever thought it a good idea to translate all the background Russian dialog and place it in big yellow letters on the screen should be shot. It adds absolutely nothing to the movie and this dialog was clearly never meant to be translated. It is distracting to have ""For the Motherland"" or ""Stop, dog. Stop dog"" blaze onto the screen in the middle of an action sequence. And, yes, there is no way to turn it off."
1,Hehhehheehh,"Well, what can you expect from a rambo movie.He is a one-man army,where he goes he wins the war. This cool guy(?) uses weapons that you see in the shooter games.He can drive every thing(chopper,tank...)and usually destroys them in the end.He drives a tank through a helicopter to down it(?).He throws arrows to shotdown choppers(?).You can see many weird and fun things in Rambo3.This movie is fun."
1,John Al-Qaeda Rambo,"Fresh after fighting the VC's in Nam, John Rambo (half-nude and with a serious speech impediment as usual) decides to really fight the liberal world conspiracy by joining Al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan, blowing up evil Russians as he goes along.Poor Jihad Johnny and his mentors Reagan and Bush obviously didn't know what the hell they were getting themselves into. Does ""Wahhabi"" mean anything to you, colonel? If the Jews have objections, we just send more aid to their settlements around Jerusalem. That usually stops them from complaining about our Stinger missiles being handed over to the Einsatzgruppen Westpakistan. Besides, the Taliban really are a lost tribe of Israel, aren't they?So Johnnyboy charges ahead, fighting the evil Commies on camel back, scoring yet another big victory for the holy war against the infidel.Thank you, Rambo. Now we can sleep in the knowledge that the free world (and Israel) is safe. NOT!"
3,Third blood,"John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) goes to Afghanistan to pull his mentor Col. Trautman's (Richard Crenna) fat out of the fire after he is captured by the Russians. That's all there is to the plot. The action is better than Part II and it doesn't display that film's distasteful disregard for the lives of foreign noncombatants, so at least it's a step up from that execrable flick, though neither of them holds a candle to the genuinely enjoyable first film. Sure, it's ridiculous and retarded, but if that's what you're in the mood for, you've come to the right movie."
3,Dign finale for Rambo series,This time Vietnam vet John Rambo(Stallone) must rescue his friend and mentor Col Trautman(Crenna) who is captured by russian forces in Afghanistan during the soviet invasion.He teams up with mullaidin's rebel forces to locate and infiltrate the facility where Trautman and other prisioners are held captive.Pure action with touches of plenty violence and signs of impossible tasks conduct the story make in cooperation with the afghan people.A dign finale of the Rambo series after the previous low sequel.
2,Rambo III takes on a whole new meaning now...,"Its funny to think that Rambo's buddies in this movie are the same people responsible for 911, well, maybe more sad than funny..Stallone mumbles his way between action scenes; taking his bow and arrows to Afganistan in search of his mentor who has been taken hostage by the evil Soviets. Stuff does blow up real good.This movie is simplistic and cartoonish but it is entertaining; just like today's American foriegn policy."
2,They have strong opinions but an immature writing style.,"The Fanthorpes want to tell us everything they know but don't bother to organize the treasure they believe they found. Facts and theories stumble over each other in long, meandering paragraphs. They announce their strong disagreement and disapproval with the theory set forth in Holy Blood, Holy Grail, but do not present an alternative clearly and with enough evidence for me to grasp. Too bad. I like their hidden treasure theme.I suppose what was especially disappointing were the several photos of Lionel looking too pleased with himself at important locales. I would rather have seen more graphs and visuals which promoted the revelations of those secrets.They present some fascinating esoteric codes at the end of the book, but don't explain them well enough for the average intelligent reader who happens not to be a puzzle fan."
1,Honestly don't waste your time,"This book does have curious information and even some interesting observations but egads! The book is meandering, ill-focused, disdainful of others 'methods' and darn near unreadable!A Priest - one could almost imagine Lionel's veins popping in righteous indignation with his smirking dismissive of the 'the Holy Blood and the Holy Grail' researchers while He and his wife sew together a hodge-podge of theories, beliefs and plain flights of fancy into an incoherent pastiche that puts a whole new slant on 'faith-based' reasoning.Its clear that the authors did a lot of on-site research, they may actually have a lot of information but getting it out of this book is like shifting through the sands of the Sahara to get a few nuggets."
1,Waste of time and money,"I've read over a dozen books on the Rennes-le-Chteau mystery, and this one has the dubious honor of being the absolute worst of the lot. If you're interested in Rennes, any other book on the subject would be a better place to start. However, if you're interested in reading the Fanthorpes spin Christian apologetics, half-baked theories based on little or no evidence, and bash other authors, then this is the book for you. Instead, I would suggest Markale's ""The Church of Mary Magdelene"", Picknett and Prince's ""The Templar Revelation"", Douzet and Coppens' ""The Secret Vault"", or pretty much any of Baigent, Lincoln and Leigh's books (which the Fanthorpes are so fond of trashing - Baigent, Lincoln, and Leigh may have been steered down some wrong paths, but hey, at least they attempted to do their homework). Seriously, don't bother with this book."
4,ALL WONDERFUL FONTS!!!!,There are some very good fonts on this cd rom. I was extremely excited about it. You will get a good deal on this if you buy this.
2,Very disappointed,"We've traveled with Fodor's books before and generally been pleased, but we were very disappointed with this edition, which we purchased in April for a trip in August. We found it terribly out of date. Exits to cities from the highway were mismarked, hours to key attractions in London and Edinburgh were wrong, and pretty much the price of every attraction was 15-20% above what was listed in the book. It appeared to me that the authors made no effort to update this version from previous years'. Next time we'll use a Frommer's or look for a locally-written guide."
3,"Beautiful, but quality is a bit disappointing","These garters are lovely, but the applique is not affixed to the organza as firmly as one would hope. I plan to use the product anyway, after having firmly pressed down the applique, but I expect that with time the design will peel off."
2,Not worth the price,"Disappointed with the function of this warmer. It does not really warm the towels unless they are layered, and then the warmth is minimal. I would have returned this if it had been installed prior to the deadline of the return policy. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of appearance and the fact that it will hold several towels."
4,Great towel warmer,Multiple layers is the key to warm DRY towels. They don't get hot.Be careful of exposed rails (children).. Need several hours to warm a large towel (as explained in the product description).We love it.. works as expected.
4,buy it to get your towels warm and dry,"Easy to install. Needs exact drilling to fasten the towel warmer.150W 24/7 is enough to keep cosy and dry a small shower/toilet if the heating is of.The surface is hot and not recommended to mount it near sensitive material as shower curtain etc.The surface finishing is rough and i would pay even $10 more for a better and smother chrome-surface instad of the nickel surface.The width is enough to dry two 1x folded, large size towels over night.I would suggest to buy aWarmrails Towel Shelf Wall Mounted Towel Warmer and Drying Shelf, Satin Nickelto store the clean towels in case you need more than two towels near by."
4,"Dryer, not much warmer","Good price, nice appearance, easy enough to install (I hardwired it myself). Like most reviews will tell you, don't expect toasty towels. I don't think the problem is with the rack since it gets nice and warm, I think is just a fact that towels don't transfer or retain heat very well. I do like the fact that the towel is nice and dry now, no feeling of wetness from yesterday's shower."
2,Not all that warm,"I ordered this unit due to the good reviews, but did not pay enough attention to the warnings that the towels became only marginally warm, not really warm. That slight difference makes a big difference in a cold or damp bathroom. We found that the towels were not warm enough to keep their heat long enough to towel off. I experimented with different layers and patterns, but we were not impressed enough to keep the unit. Although it was poorly packed and the carton was heavily damaged, it arrived intact, but I will have to make some major repairs to send the unit back in the original packing. I suppose the good side is that it does not draw much current and does not burn if touched, but for us not worth the candle. I will be looking for a better unit such as those found in posher hotels."
4,Does the job,"Works exactly as advertised although the finish is disappointing. The description does not say that the 'Satin Nickel' is not, but a faux paint job."
4,Towel warmer,"Keeps towels dry, but takes longer than published. Not as easy to mount as instructions lead you to believe, the area behind the switch is almost impossible to get both mounting screws into. Nice to have warmish towels and keeps them from getting mildew smell on them as they dry out completely in a few hours."
4,Towel rack warmer,I was looking for something to dry my towels since we turn the heat down low through out the day. This works perfectly. A slight warmth is just enough and to use a dry warm towel on the winter mornings is nice too.
4,"Warm,dry towels...umm...umm.","Product seems to work as described. We fold the towels in 4 and can comfortably fit 4 bath towels on the rack with room for 2 hand towels on the bottom rung. They are kept warm and more importantly are always dry after the previous use. I can now dry with one towel - before I would use two. Installing on the wall was fairly easy, the product seems well built and looks well finished without exposed screw holes etc. Not sure about the quantity of energy use-manufacturer says the same as a light bulb but does not specify how big a light bulb! My guess would be 250 watts. I plan to install with a timer for the summer months. Overall-pleased/satisfied. (No complaints from 'She who must be obayed' for you Rumpole of the Bailey fans!)"
3,Warmrails,"I love the style and it hardwired fine, but I only wish it made the towels warmer. We do have thick towels and this may be the reason, but just seems it should warm the towels more."
2,Return Problem,"The rack arrived and was installed per instructions but it would not work. Went to the manufacturer web site for troubleshooting and it stated ""if it doesn't work correctly it was likely installed wrong."" Not much help. Contacted Homecenter.com for a return and after 6 days without a return authorization I finally took the device apart and discovered a faulty off/on switch. Poor service, I won't buy from Homecenter.com again."
1,Just point a heat dish($20) on a regular rack($20),"I also don't like the fact that it takes a long time to heat up the towel, but the wattage is limited for safety concerns. No one is gonna be happy with grill marks on her towels.I find it a much better option to just point a heat dishOptimus H-4110 9-Inch Dish Heateron your towels. Much faster and warmer.Perhaps there's a good reason why these things are not popular in most parts of the world."
2,Not worth the price,"This rack is warm to the touch when on, but a thinnish towel takes a full day to dry on it - which may just be because it air dries eventually. I've tested it with different towels and even my thinner towels are not toasty warm even when it's been on overnight - they are simply room temperature. If you want toasty warm, dry towels to step into after your shower, this is NOT the heated towel rack for you!"
2,It's okay!,"Over all it has a nice look for the price. Comes with the option to be plugged directly into the wall with no wires hanging on the floor. We leave in San Francisco where the weather is on the cooler side all year round, not too much sun and I was hopping that this unit would not only heat up the towels which it hardly does but dry them up as well. It takes it almost two days for the drying part, that's only if you keep it on 24/7 on, lost of energy and for this to work you have to have multiple towels on top of each other. We kept it because we had gone through the trouble of mounting it and painting the bath room because of it."
1,We ordered in July and still waiting ... latest update (the 3rd) mid-January 2010,"We ordered this towel warmer a couple months before we needed it. At that time we accepted a 6 - 8 week lead time. But we received an email at the beginning of September that there was a manufacturer delay. New estimate at that time was for the end of September.I checked the eFaucets website today. I logged into my account with them, re-read my order and found out that they now estimate January 2010.We're going to reconsider whether we could possibly live without the WarmRails Kensington towel warmer."
3,A bit underwhelming!,"I saw previous reviews about the design however the rack appears well constructed and was easy to install - I find the product only worthy of a 3 star review. Yes the rack does in fact warm your towels and the key word is warm. If you are expecting your bath towel to be toasty, you'll be disappointed. I have not found my towels to be entirely warm even after a 24 hour period. If you are really looking for a warm toasty towel, I suspect you need to spend 3 times this amount to really get a true warm towel"
1,Not a Keeper,"This product did not warm our towels, even after an overnight warm-up. The only area that was barely warm was where the towel actually draped over the rod. We did not expect hot-from-the-dryer towels, but this was really poor. We sent the product back."
1,Poor quality,"Satin finish is simply paint, mine arrived with multiple scratches and was returned right away"
5,No problem!,Fit perfect! restored ride height from sagging original 4 springs. Matched up with KYB KG4513 Gas shocks for a excellent handling ride and driving performance. Very happy with results!
5,Amazing,"The music is epic, majestic, meditative, and inspiring. I'd highly suggest it to anyone who loves orchestral music, soundtracks, and such things."
3,Decent Album,"I wish there were more upbeat songs on this album. My favorite is #1, the title song. Peppy and original. #2 is good, too. The rest is a little more slow, almost like a slightly mournful series of classical songs."
5,So sensual!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,It is one of the best soundtrack that I have heard. The music is as sensual as the one from Kama Sutra the Soundtrack.
3,Little Ladies of the Night,I should have just kept my old VHS copy. The quality is just like that-taped from TV. I wasted some money. Live & learn.
3,Good,I like how it talks about the life of streets and the restaurant scene was filmed at my friends restaurant
3,it was a alright film,"David Soul&Louis Gossett Jr play in a Buddy,Buddy film that sets to clean up the streets. Clifton Davis plays a Pimp in this film. I use to watch this film back in the day on tv. I haven't seen this film in ages,but I remember it just like yesterday. this was a cool film for the time period. Linda Purl did pretty good as well in this film."
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this for my son but we did not even get to use the product. My PC has Win2000 installed and even though Me Too Software Tech support claims that this would work on Win 2000 it DOES NOT.Save your money and buy the Media Manager from Sony.
4,Drama anime style.,"The progenitor has to be one of the better of the Ceres dvd's yet. In Relic of the Mikage, the original mikage has to some extent gained control over Aki in the same manner as Ceres has to Aya. However, unlike Ceres , Mikage is unwilling to give his host control back. Leaving Aya to come to grips with it.The return of the First, is a continuation of the Mikage assuming control. And causing a trigger to Toya's memory near the endToya's past is one of the more touching episodes to date. Afterall, Aya has a double? no wonder there's confusion. It also gives Toya's story( we finally learn how old he is! ) which is intersting with all of it's drama. Casting uncertainty on the relationship between Toya and Aya. It does leave one to wonder if it is true or another of the Mikage schemes.I gotta say I have watched this dvd more than any of the other's simply for these episodes. I think this is definatly a must-have dvd."
4,rather disturbing.....o.O,"This volume of Ceres WAS a bit strange. Aki's mind finally snaps, and the progenitor of the Mikage family emerges in Aki's place. ""Aki"" squeezing grandpa Mikage's face after becoming annoyed with his rambling. (Yes, he did die o.O) Later, Aki sees Touya and Aya kissing, then kisses Aya himself. (Very un-brotherly!) Later, Touya and Aya meet a girl who's just a spitting image of Aya. Touya gets smacked by a car, then remebers his past, but he forgets all about Aya and the present. The girl they met is supposedly Touya's old childhood friend, and girlfriend. What about Touya and Aya?"
5,Entertaining and informative,I needed to learn a lot of interesting facts about Beethoven fast so I could write a paper for school for my Music Appreciation class. This documentary hit the spot. It was just what I needed right when I needed it. Thank you Amazon for having it available at my finger tips. The musicians featuring the music of Beethoven in the film were amazing in their abilities. The historians and musicologists were well informed and the information they presented was very useful to me.
4,"verry special, a good vew of this genius","a verry special vew in the live of this genius and in the time in witch he lived. Also showing the dark sides of his live. The beleave in him self helped him to live and write down what he ""heard"" in him self"
2,Slow and boring.,"This was the first Michelle West novel I have read and it will probably be the last. The settings could have been interesting, but it all ended up being very boring and slow. There are a lot of setting changes which make it difficult to understand what is going on, and if in fact one should care anything for any character around. I just could not care, and it was a chore to finish this novel. Other reviews compare this to authors I do like a lot, but for me this just fell flat.To be as fair as possible, it is NOT an awful book, I can see why other people should think it interesting, but it was below what I would consider an average novel, so my verdict is 2 stars."
4,well worth the time,"the orignality, depth of story and characters is unmatched by anything i'vereadoutside of George R. Martin. i look forward to the rest of the series."
3,It was okay...,"I liked this book because I like just about all fantasy books in general. After about a few hundred pages I felt like I would fall alseep at any moment. It is long and slighty boring. It has it's exciting parts though, just like any other book. I going to be reading the second one shortly and I hope that it might be slighty more interesting. I didn't really like the political views and such either. Some of it was intriging though, But most of it was boring. I would recommend this book only to those who are patient in their reading and can stand boringness."
2,Excellent contextual promise; fell through like a brick,I read West's first SUNSWORD book up to about 40 or 50 pages. It had promise but it was waaaay too much effort to wade through. Very heavy on details and context but poor in pacing and keeping the reader focused and understanding of the world.
2,convoluted,"Ms. Wests style is comparable to legal briefs, except legal briefs are easier to read and understand. Hundreds of pages go by and very little happens - almost like a soap opera, except that soap operas are usually cogent and easily understood - and, like this book - boring. This book is slow to develop a plot, if a plot is ever discovered. I never did find the plot but, then again, I kept falling asleep while reading it.My library is comprised of several thousand volumes and this series (I actually bought the whole thing) will be relegated to the very, very few that I have not read nor will read."
5,"West continues to develop depth, insight in her sixth novel.","Michelle West has begun to develop as an author in ways that begin to move her beyond the genre fantasies that she writes. Her newest book returns her to the world explored in the Sacred Hunt. As her writing continues to develop she becomes much more adept at developing fully three dimensional characters where she explores human strength and frailty in a completly captivating fashion. A touch of mystery leaves the reader with many opportunities for speculation and exploration and the ever present desire to read more. I hope the release of the second volume in the Sunsword series will happen quickly. A great read, with real depth and real perception"
4,Pretty Good,"It's pretty good, but if you've seen the film, you know Blaque is in it, and well of course they sing in it. So if you are a fan of Blaque, then this is a good CD for you. But if you don't like Blaque, then I suggest you don't get it."
3,New Heater Core Priced Right,"I have Heat with a Little Smell at start, Better then the Old One which had a small leak- We Will See!"
4,Fun item,"I bought this at Walmart actually but happened to see it on here when I was trying to find out how to plug them in to work. I had it done when I first bought it and now I can't get it the same way.Otherwise, fun cute item tho."
5,Good cable,"heavy cable packed on a big spool. It will do the job.Good purchase. I am very impressed with the quality of this cable, and I am glad I didn't fork over twice the money for other cables."
5,Lucio fulci has open the vault of uncut terror,"june 18,02 tuesday I taught t have seen the original city of the dead dvd .but no this is the uncut version the was film when lucio was alive this one contains gut seens the were cut of from the movie it has more blood guts and seens of the moviethe you havent seen .dont torture a duckling is uncut it has seen the i havent seen at all guts blood when a gril is rip little from her skin by the towns people and is uncut from the vault of lucio bouth dvds are original uncencerd and complete. im the fist to own it you must see by henry"
5,Great Product So Far!,I just received this product Sunday and it has been great so far! Gets rid of facial hair fast and is much easier to trim your eyebrows with this than tweezers. I would recommend to anyone and you can't complain about the price.
2,scrape off the fuz?,for what I wanted (on my face) this is no better than a razor. don't waste your time. hard to get it at the right angle.
1,hopless item,"hello, it is a worthless item, did not take out a single hair from my chin, even i tried to put soap still nothing came out.it a sheer waste of money, willl NOT recommend to anyone. thanks"
1,junk,"i was going to order 4 of these but im so glad i changed it to one because they do not work, very dull and they need to stop selling them. i've tried different brands and these are the worse and i had to throw them away."
4,silky smooth results!,"i use this on my face & neck (below the cheekbones only) thanks to a Michelle Money video on youtube. The eyebrow shaper works well and requires little cleaning after each use. i can't attest to the effectiveness of it as an eyebrow shaper, but it works great on the neck & face to get rid of any unwanted hairs and create a smoother base for foundation application."
2,Not Sharp Enough!,"This razor comes with a stainless steel safety cover glued over the blade, which is supposed to stop you from cutting yourself, but it just makes the blade almost useless. It also meant that the razor was very rough and just irritated my skin. It didn't take off even the finest peach fuzz on my face, and I would definitely recommend plucking rather than shaving for your eyebrows. I would recommend getting a brand that doesn't use a cover."
2,B,"This item is a piece of junk. It does not work at all. Do not waste your 3 dollars on it, you would be better of buying a lotto ticket with the money. I did not have any issues with the shipping, and the transaction went smoothly. That is the only reason I am giving this item 2 stars, otherwise I would have rated it 1 star."
2,Does not wake after sleep in Mac OS X 10.6 and 10.7,Card works fine until my Mac Pro 8-core goes to sleep. After that it seems impossible to restore USB connectivity. Sonnet claims the issue is that Apple broke/changed the USB driver since Mac OS X 10.6. Read their FAQ before purchasing!
3,Foghat Fan,"Good selection of songs, but a poor sound mix. Sounds like it was recorded off an 8-track player; couldn't adjust the vocals , sounded muddy. Still rocks away."
1,Save your money.,"With the shortened version of Slow Ride & Drivin Wheel, I'd say save your money & look for the far superior BEST OF volume 1 or the harder to find volume 2 on Rhino. Same problem(short version of Slow Ride) but you get a better scope of songs."
1,Slow Down The Ride,Foghat.... Doesent seem too ring a bell does it? Bassicly Foghat the band when it comes to mind all you think of is that song Slow Ride which is good but what else is there too the band. I'll tell you what else there is NOTHING... Except cheap hit cd's that go for about 5 bucks and never sell because no one wants to waste five bucks on this music. Just another forgotten band that no one has heard of.
2,There are better books!,"Unfortunately, I cannot say much good about this book. Although there are some very good pieces of information in it, I found the book pretty useless in terms of putting together a story. Very little guidance in the actual process of story-making.I've heard Donald Davis ""in concert."" He was wonderful. But I'm pretty disappointed by his book."
4,"Low-Fi, But Still Jack Logan","This album is really the brain child of Logan's buddy and bandmate, Kelly Keneipp (hence his name in the title). He took a bunch of unreleased songs he found on old Logan tapes and cleaned them up as best he could. While the sound quality is sometimes spotty, the song quality never is. If you liked Logan's Bulk, or any of his other albums, you are ensured to enjoy this album--it has the wide range of styles (from straight up country to loud ugly punk). If has the lyrics you would expect from a Jack Logan album as well. Highly recommended."
4,good,Product in good conditions and good contents.I really liked it and i recommend it a lot. the price was nice.
5,Herb Snips,I love these snips. They are very sharp and easy to clean. They also can strip leaves from herbs efficiently.
1,Not a great reference tool,I was disappointed that this book didn't turn out to be more a thesaurus for slang terms.
1,Warner should get their act together....,"I'm sick and tired of these ""theme packs"". They're useless. I would never collect TV series if I could not get all episodes on chronological order, and I will not even if it's South Park. I have the two first seasons which are great on Region 1 (and were done by Rhino), but from now on I'm sticking with Region 2, on which all 4 seasons are available in chronological order. (I know this is the VHS version, I'm referring to the DVD releases)"
1,..Theme Packs!,...These theme packs are an insult to the hardcore South Park fan. Avoid it at all costs.
2,"great material, poorly done","The narrative jumps around, unfocused and unsure of itself, and never truly captures the convicts. No dramatic tension and anti-climactic."
5,"Riveting, bizarre and beautifully told","I started reading this book merely because the subject sounded so strange and barbaric: a prison where murderers and rapists put on a rodeo. Sure enough, there are plenty of strange, barbaric details of these guys, prison life, the venal warden, and the violence of the rodeo. But what's most strange is how poignant the book becomes as the author examines the yearnings of the men, the warden and himself. He's a tough reporter blessed with a tender heart - and a great eye. The scenes and the characters he brings to life will stay with you."
4,Angola Bound: a friend gets religion on death row,"Bergner,who I should begin by saying I've known personally for some 13 years, has done an in incredible thing in this his first work of non-fiction. He's written a book that at once takes the reader to a deceptively verdant-death-row in Louisiana (the Prison was formerly a Plantation, think Tara times ten) to the born-again-warden's living-room,to the inmate's families less-than-Tara-like-homes. Bergner has focused all of his novelist's empathy and amazing acuity, and attention to detail on the lives of a few good----though very Bad men. The book becomes increasingly spiritual as the writers' year with the inmates draws to a close---as did this reader's experience of the writing and of Bergner's subjects'lives. Ultimately it's a book that, eventhough I work in publishing and could get them for free, I've just ordered six copies of to give to friends who Dan and I do not have in common."
5,An Extraordinary Book,"Dan Bergner does an exceptional job of bringing the reader into a world that the reader will (hopefully) never visit on their own. In doing so, Bergner paints a uniquely vivid picture of the deprivation and desperation that is life in Angola and brings to life the inmates who populate the prison, including the warden with whom Bergner struggles for access and integrity. Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this book is that, in the end, it is about more than the inmates or the guards or the prison, it is about life and the struggle for transcendence. In sum, this is a remarkable book that will be appreciated by anyone who even mildly enjoys great writing."
2,Disappointing,"The positive reviews I have read here are mystifying. Bergner is a talented writer, for sure, but I really felt as if he mailed in this book more than anything. It sure didn't seem like he spent a year at Angola prison or even in the vicinity. Seemed more to me as if he flew down there every once in awhile to see what's up. The book starts off GREAT, the first third, and then proceeds to fall apart with the not-so-interesting details of his fight with warden Cain to retain his access. Once he wins that fight it's as if the author has lost his steam. The charcters, even warden Cain, don't seem to come to life and their story, the one he tells, just isn't so compelling. I just came away feeling that the author was worn out. Too bad, too. I had high hopes for this one. Want to read a book that DOES make this kind of access work? Try Pete Early's The Hot House, about his two or three years inside of Leavenworth."
4,"Fun, but not really a reference book","This book tries to do too much in too small a space, and it is therefore in no way comprehensive. That said, it does have lots of interesting factoids, entertaining quizzes, colorful photos, and coverage of great musicians and international genres you probably don't know enough about. There are a smattering of typos and inaccuracies, but not so many that it spoils the fun. Appendices contain a glossary and lists of recommended music festivals, awards, websites, songs, and movies."
3,"They lost you know, Douglas.","Live outing for Douglas who patriotically shows his loyalty concerning Britain's part in the second world war by coming on stage dressed as the enemy. Why did we fight the battle of Britain? I forget now. Good version of his Kraftwerk Pastiche 'Frost Flowers', though. Exciting his audience is unthinkable for Mr P, so prepare to be very bored in the second half. But it's an interesting kind of boring, if you see what I mean."
4,A Blast From Your 80s Past,"I bought this item as a birthday present for a loved one who was feeling nostalgic about the fun 80s snack, Koala Yummies. They are very similar to the old version, and are very tasty. Beware, however, that this big pack is a box filled with smaller individual-sized bags. Also, quite a few of the koalas did not manage to survive during the process of shipping -- many were crushed. But all in all, a fun snack, and worth the price if you're looking for the memories as well!"
5,"It's about the music, stupid!","How can anyone review this film and not even mention the fine score by Nino Rota? The score adds emotional depth to many of the poignant scenes, underscores the humor in others, and never becomes an unwanted distraction as with most modern film scores. I especially liked the way the ""Sioux Mambo"" is used as a prelude to each of Fausto's ""turning points.""It's easy to see why this film has spawned so many imitations and inspired many directors, especially Martin Scorsese - a director who knows how to weave music into the fabric of his films as if it were an additional character.One last point on Scorsese, when the Vitelloni are introduced in the beginning it was impossible for me not to think of the same introduction technique used in Goodfellas.Great use of locations, a very good cast, brilliant cinematography, but most of all a great evocative score make I, Vitelloni well worth the price of admission and worthy of repeated viewings."
3,Good,"I Vitelloni is not great cinema, but it is an important film in the Fellini canon, biographically, in its ability to be a Rosetta Stone to other key moments and images in later films of his. It is a film that, at first blush, seems like a simple melodrama, but upon rewatch shows colors not seen the first time. It also augurs a theme that Fellini would satirize to grand fruition in La Dolce Vita, his masterpiece: the anomy of modern human existence. There was a time when life was arranged- marriages and apprenticeships. But Fellini was alive at the time that changed, and the modern loner was born. It would take a landsman- Martin Scorsese- in a different country, to realize the end results of that anomy, in his masterpiece, Taxi Driver. But without the vitelloni there is no Mean Streets nor Travis Bickle. You got a problem with that?"
2,Typical Fellini Vacuousness.,"Viewed: 6/12Rate: 36/12: Being lured to seeing I Vitelloni by the virtue of Alberto Sordi's magnificent performance in Mafioso but not at all enchanted by any of Federico Fellini's works, I was laid a dud of a picture. The story, my goodness...it makes for a ten minute short film, and the plot is really all over the place with different storylines going on at once. Just pick one, and stick with it. Otherwise, I'm dulled by the going ons for each of the stupid Italian wastrels because...like I care. All in all, if you love pretentiousness, I Vitelloni is the film for you."
2,Larger than advertised,"While the cookie cutters seem to be of good quality - the advertised size of ""about 1 1/2"" size"" is not correct, The cutters I received are twice that size - measuring a little over 3""."
5,Snapalicious!,"If you enjoy some of Kirk Read's syndicated columns in the gay press, prepare for an equally insightful and amusing voice, but with a sweet anecdotal and utterly Southern charm.Read recounts his teenhood as an ongoing process of learning, suffering and coming out bit by bit, yet he dispenses with self-tortured misery, and offers an uplifting and often hilarious take on the horrors of high school.Read provides an updated version of the teen coming out memoir, with modern updates. It made me wonder how many other new queer kids cut out pictures of Sir Ian McKellan and put them on their lockers. Read recounts his personal activism in rural Virginia. Diet Coke, Casey Donovan, gym teachers, Judas Priest, drama club; ""Child,"" this is a fun and uplifting account with all the style and richness of the best young adult fiction. But it's all true!"
2,Less Than Expected,"I became a fan of Kirk's from his syndicated columns, and saw him at a local reading of this book. His readings are entertaining, with lots of energy, but the book itself disappointed me. It's not really his fault, but his potentially funniest chapter, an episode exploring the Southern rite of passage of tipping cows with drunken rednecks, reads as an awkward dying giggle in the long shadow of the Matthew Shepherd hate murder. The grown-ups in this book are distressingly childish.I think this material would have worked better as one or two magazine articles, or a single performance art piece, as there are countless indulgent details about characters who never reappear and seem to exist in the book for no other reason than Kirk happens to remember them. How could the decade since these events have left him with so little insight? Kirk's response to challenge is invariably to act more queer. In an increasingly post-gay world, Kirk Read comes across as just a brat."
3,Good but could be better.,"The book is good and it keeps your attention, but you are left with the thought of ""what was the point""? The book does not go in depth at all. And he only touches on his eating disorder which would have made an amazing chapter. He did not go through anything in high school that anybody, straight or gay, did not experience. There was not point to this book. It was funny and quick witted but he got on my nerves right from the beginning. He does not tie in the Snap to the whole story. You are left to figure that out on your own. I do not recommend this book."
2,Entertaining but problematic,"First, I must say that I did enjoy the book. However, I have some problems. The book seems meant to be some kind of boost for young people, which I totally understand. He paints a picture of himself that is really positive. He's this kid who was just like everyone else and he didn't give a second thought to anything anyone may have thought about him. That just seems dishonest though. He had to be bothered by some of the things his classmates said to him. As strong a personality as he might have been growing up, there's no way Mr. Read was totally accepted in the South. I do think this book would be good for gay youths though. Once they grow up though, they'll realize what a fairy tale it is. Because life isn't even that easy for straight kids, much less someone as different from the norm as Mr. Read."
5,enjoyed this a lot!,I remember reading this in high school and really enjoying it. It's funny and its totally for anyone who was ever felt like an outsider growing up. One of the better gay books out there.
4,Review of Slurry Systems Handbook,"I found this book to be well written, informative and well organized. The book seems to stand alone as a practical concise reference. There was a well developed theoretical section and several practical design sections.Since there are many more engineering studies performed than actual slurry projects, I would have liked to see more practical examples developed on line sizing and project costing.An update to the book should include some of the many engineering references available on the internet......The book is well worth the price....buy it.....!!!"
1,Use with caution!,"I have found a large number of typographical and math errors in this book. Although for the most part, the book is informative about the formulas, there are a number of formulas that are incorrect. Fortunately you can find the original citations to get the correct equations. I recommend you do the example problems, to verify the formulas."
3,Could be a bit more authentic,"While there is no doubt to the value of Carlson's books, I have been slightly disapointed with some of the authenticity. ( Example: New World Cocoa Mix is made with nondairy creamer and powered chocolate drink mix--like Quik. These are not items EVER found in colonial times so the ""recreation"" of the drink is not much of a learning experience) Try David C King's American Kids in History series (Colonial Days) for a more realistic items."
5,great activity book for colonial units,"We homeschool, and are currently covering colonial America. While there are plenty of great texts to use, and many great fiction books to supplement those texts, an activity book like this is invaluable. The book includes sections on sailing and settling in the New World, clothing, the home, eating, everyday life, arts & crafts, school and games. Each chapter includes several to many activities, such as building a ship, making butter, making soap, paper quilling, making a quill pen and ink, playing horseshoes, etc. There are over 75 activities, from cooking to making toys -- all of which help to deepen one's understanding of life in the colonies.This has proven to be a valuable supplement to our texts. Highly recommended."
5,My 7 year old loves this,"My son got this book for Christmas and he read it cover to cover. He loves it! He wants to make EVERY project, so of course I have to make sure we have all the necessary parts then supervise the project. At first I was annoyed at having to be so involved, but then I realized that my thinking was flawed and these projects were giving me some more quality time with my son. And besides just being fun, making these projects are educational and gave me a chance to share my love of American history with my child.They grow up too fast, but this book will give you opportunities to slow down and make some memories while making some pretty fun colonial projects. I recommend this book."
3,--,"The book is very rich in details on the author's journey through Asia. Basically half the book is about his journey to the Tibetan monastery. I was expecting more details on his findings. He simply cites the findings in a chronological order he made, which are interesting by the way (e.g saying that Pilate was the one to condemn Christ), but I'd like more exploitaion into the findings.Overall it's good with very different perceptions from the Catholic Bible."
3,Interesting,"This was an interesting piece. Whether you personally beleive that Jesus was Issa, doesn't matter. This was a story about a mans journey in the east. It was a little dry in some places, descriptions of the countryside, places he visited, and customs of the people were pretty good. Each person has their own individual search for Truth and it was fascinating to read of this man's story."
5,Better than I remembered.,"So often those childhood favorites don't hold the same charm as they did when you first saw them, but I was just as delighted as I was when I first saw this at 7 years old. I too had to dig this out at the local library to share it with my kids, and it was well worth the effort, they loved it as much as I did. PLEASE RERELEASE!"
4,For Teachers: Comparison to Originals,"My students were reading Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book. When we got to chapters that were on this video, we would read the story, watch the movie, and the students wrote comparison paragraphs of the movie to the book. At the end of watching the three Kipling shows, we compiled the students' paragraphs, wrote intros and conclusions, and published their completed papers. The students learned about making a story ""kid friendly"" and how tradition sometimes overtakes reality."
5,"Wow, I still remember this film from when I was like 7 ....","This Mongoose's Samurian sense of honor, and sense of duty is most magnaminous; it ponders one to think we can learn so much from a cartoon. Rudyard Kipling is a Genious, Chuck Jones is a genious...mix them up and you're in for an experience worth remembering.By the movie, for nastalgia, for novelty, for your kids, for a lesson, and enjoy it for life.I recommend this movie."
5,Excellent Story!,This is Kipling's charming tale of a brave little mongoose named Rikki Tikki Tavi. He is adopted by a little English boy and his family in India. Rikki saves the family from the dreaded cobra. This is a great movie you can see over and over. Very well done!
5,A must have for children of all ages,"Having grown up watching all these (6 shows) first run I was thrilled to purchase this. I bought one copy for myself, my father, and my friend. His 7 year old Daughter is absolutely enchanted with the Rikki Tikki Tavi story. She has watched it everyday for a month straight. These stories are based on the actual books and Chuck didn't embellish one bit. Disney made me love ""the Jungle Book"" but Chuck Jones made me love Kipling. The cricket in times square is no literary slouch either!"
4,Lived up to memories!,"Purchased this DVD for nephews based on a dim recollection of watching the Kipling Jungle Book storirs on network TV way bavk when I was their age. Watched it with them (5 & 7 yrs old) and loved the stories again as much as they did. The stories about the cricket are nice diversions too, but the Kipling tales of a boy raised by wolves, a brave white sea lion (seal?) saving his people and, of course, the brave mongoose, were worth the cost alone."
5,a classic for the family,You won't find these great stories on netflix. The kids enjoy it. Several tales that are sure to keep the interest of the kids during movie night.
5,Fond Memories,"The only one of the cartoons I remember watching as a kid is Rikki-Tikki-Tavi because it was played every year like the ""Wizard of Oz"" and ""The Ten Commandments"" and I enjoyed it each time.I like the visual style it had and I remember dramatic background music.I have not watched the dvd so I don't know the quality of the disc. I'm giving it as a Christmas gift this year to my sister's kids. I'm hoping they'll like it as much as I did because it'll be new to them."
2,Disappointing Reproduction,"I ordered this book mainly because I wanted to learn more about the Olympus C 3030 Zoom digital camera which I own. The original Olympus owner's manual, IMHO, is terrible. This book is a better manual, with good explanantions and examples (that are not easy to see at times) but is it worth the price? I mean, it is a spiral notebook of 102 pages. (...) Also, when I read the description of the book at the author's site, it says that the book was loosely bound so that it could be updated readily. Well, my copy says ""2000"" on the inside page and I doubt anything has been changed since the original printing. Maybe if the book is ordered from Mr. Curtin directly, it is updated, but I prefer ordering books through Amazon because of this company's reputation for good customer service."
4,The last reviewer was quite harsh,"I really enjoyed this book. Mr. Roberts wrote a wonderful story about his wife that he continues to love deeply. It is a beautiful love story! I believe that the author is grateful for the many years that he spent with his wife and I think that it is incredibly sweet and touching that he wrote a book about their lives together. As for the last reviewer, instead of ""flipping through"" the book while you were waiting for your prescription, you should have taken the time to read the book. Instead of taking the time to write a negative review based on the few pages you read, you could have used that time to read a beautiful love story."
1,An arrogant jerk!,"After having the misfortune of buying this book(?) and reading the first paragraph I had to toss my cookies. The author comes across as a totally arrogant jerk. It's too bad that one of more of the women that had the 'misfortune' of meeting him haven't written their own rendition. If they would, I'd be at the head of the line to purchase it."
1,But a 5-star metaphor!!!,"There is only one thing ""wrong"" with this book: it points men and women in the wrong direction, outward instead of inward. Psychosexually speaking, in this day and age of widespread rape, domestic violence, and sexually transmitted diseases, it behooves each potential Lover, whether male or female, to ""come within"" and cease ""looking for It"" out there, which is to say, treat every ""male"" online as a Voice, not a physical person, and inner Voice for astute women, the Voice of her own Animus (see Jung's books); the reverse is true for men, the inner Voice belonging to the Anima. Within EACH individual, the inner marriage of both Anima and Animus results in personal peace, happiness, and even Joy. Thank you for the 5-star metaphor!"
1,"Awful, simply awful","Juvenile movie......and that is being disrespectful of juveniles. This movie was not scary, poorly made in every way from film quality to sound quality. The acting was dreadful and the plot was at best ""thin"".Avoid this movie as you would a chancre encrusted genital. This is the video equivalent of a sexually transmitted disease.Don't spend your money renting this much less purchasing the thing. I think I actually paid $3.99 to rent the thing for a week and I feel like I have been gang raped by a herd of horses. Thank you Amazon for charging almost $4.00 to rent this dreadful excuse for a movie."
1,humans vs zombies,"TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT! The game is way too dark and I tried several times to play on my phone (I've got a fairly large screen) but in the end, I uninstalled the game. I'm sure it would be pretty awesome on a LARGE screen."
2,To many baby's!,"The album was really embarrasing to disney's classical songs.The only artist who were able to make this album worthy of it's two star rating were *NSYNC and Christinia Aguilera. Don't buy the album, down load the songs with Nsync and Aguilera, unless you want to waste [money]."
5,Amazing Collection,"This is one of the greatest various collection of artist know to date. The wonderful blend of pop and r&b voice makes this cd a hit. Usher's ""You'll be in my Heart"" is a one of a kind song that takes my breath away everytime. and the vocal quality of all other artist is high. This is a great cd."
4,TRY IT OUT!,WELL THIS CD IS PRETTY GOOD! I MEAN THEY COULD'VE PICKED SOME DIFFERENT SINGERS LIKE(GET RID OF>) AARON CARTER AND HILARY DUFF. COME ON THEY CAN'T SING WORTH ANYTHING THE ARE LUCKY TECHNOLOGY IS SO WELL ADVANCED. USHER DID AWESOME SINGING THE YOU'LL BE IN MY HEART SONG! I MEAN THE ORINGINALS WILL ALWAYS BE GREAT! I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO JUMP 5 IS BUT THEY DID A NICE TWIST ON THE BEAUTY AND THE BEAST! A*TEENS WELL I AM NOT A FAN BUT I LIKE THERE VERSION OF UNDER THE SEA! WELL I AM NOT YOU AND I THINK ALL AND ALL THIS CD IS PRETTY GOOD. BUT LIKE I SAID I AM NOT YOU SO TRY IT FOR YOURSELF AND SEE IF YOU LIKE IT! IF YOU HAVE A LIL KID WHO LIKES DISNEY THEN MAYBE TRY THIS AS A GIFT OR A CHRISTMAS PRESENT! I AM ALMOST POSITIVE THEY WILL LUV IT! I HOPE I HELPED!A HELPING HAND!(OH AND THIS WEEK 21-25 OF OCT WEAR A RED RIBBON FOR MADD)!! THANKS
2,Not very good,"Yes, it's nice to finally see modern singers make original Disney songs into modern hits. However, most of the songs are bad and dreadful. The only ones I found good were the ones by Ashanti, Jessica Simpson, Hilary Duff, and Christina Aguilera. The rest are pretty bad. Boy bands? Teen pop girls? Don't think so. Don't think this will be very good. I don't recommend this CD. Get some better music, although I give it 1 extra star for the good songs I mentioned earlier in this review."
5,REALLY GREAT CD,"THIS IS A REALLY GOOD CD WITH SOME NICE SONGS. THE BEST SONGS WOULD HAVE TO BE FROM JUMP5 THERE VERSION OF TALE AS OLD AS TIME IS BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL, AND ATEENS DID AN AWESOME JOB ON THERE VERSION OF UNDER THE SEA. I ALSO LIKE AARON CARTER'S I JUST CANT WAIT TO BE KING."
5,Love It!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,What can I say about this album? Oh yeah I know what I wasgonna say about that album.I give all the songs that everyperson sang a 5/5 and it's the best album of my Disneymanias.I'm dying to get this album.Good Job Disneymania!
2,Why?,"I give this one 2 stars. They took already loved and award winning songs like ""Under the Sea"" and turned them into some wanna be pop songs. Others on it are okay. But I ask you, ""Why fix something that isn't broken???""~*~Alison~*~"
3,Sort of...,"This album was pretty good in general, and here are the tracks that I believe were the best:-Part of Your World-The Tiki, Tiki, Tiki Room-Colors of the Wind-Beauty and The Beast-Under The SeaThe others were sung by very talented singers, for sure, but somehow, their voices just don't cut it. It's probably because we all know how those Disney classics really sound, and simply have this imprint in our minds, and no matter how popular these singers are, their renditions simply aren't good enough. Somehow, they just don't carry that feeling, the effort, that was put into the original.The songs I listed above were my personal favorites. I could listen to them over and over and wouldn't get bored. Though they've been redone with a more hip-hop feel to them, the singers keep the basic meanings in mind, and it really shows through."
5,LOVED DisneyMania,"This is a great cd, especially for younger fans that like Disney, but that love pop/hip hop. Usher's ""You'll Be in My Heart"" is such a beautiful song! Great artists singing favorite old Disney songs......I would definitely buy a DisneyMania Vol. 2, or Vol. 3Love Love Love this cd.... 5 stars!!!:)"
1,Piece of utter rubbish,"Interesting how they managed to take every major disney song.....songs that i've happened to grow up with by the way.......and totally sap them of every semblence of spirit and creativity and turn them into today's ultimate ""pop sensation"" wannabe stars like Hilary Duff can claim to be something, and other people can turn beautiful ballads such as Colors of the Wind into a normal pop/soul piece of ... that makes you want to beat your stereo into a plastic pulp. They turned something that was supposed to be remotely Native American into......a colorless blend of normality that pains me to listen to. Shame on you Disney, I thought you could sink no lower than ""Jungle book 2"""
3,"Good, but not great","This CD delivers what it promises: radio-ready, bubblegum pop versions of classic Disney songs. It's a decent CD, but its only shortcoming is that there's very little variety-- 7 of the album's 15 tracks are from either The Little Mermaid or The Lion King, and only 4 are from films made before 1989.There are plenty of Disney tunes that could easily be translated into bubblegum pop hits... The Aristocats' ""Everybody Wants to be a Cat"", Lady and the Tramp's ""He's a Tramp"", just to mane a few. And I simply cannot understand why they didn't include ""I Won't Say (I'm in Love)"" from Hercules. It's a great song, and a girl group like No Secrets could have performed it outstandingly.One more thing: Smash Mouth's version of ""I Wan'na Be Like You"" is fantastic. It's almost worth buying the CD for that track alone."
2,Why ???,"Most of these songs have already been released in its original soundtrack and also released as a Pop song on radio.Why would they remake these songs and totally change the beat to reflect todays urban youth ? Our youthful melodies were not made to become Urbanized.At least with the original songs,you could bring back memories of the original films. This CD makes it hard to reflect on memories if the music has been changed."
1,You've got to be kidding,"I love disney, but them letting these so called ""artists"" make a cd was the worst decision they have ever made. I hate what they have done. The originals are and always will be better.. so in three simple words.. don't buy it!"
5,Happy Mother,"I originally purchased this CD for my daughter (age 31/2) who is a big fan of the Disney Channel. She loved all of the songs because they reminded her of her favorite Disney Movies. After listening to songs like ""You'll be in my Heart"" by Usher and ""Under the Sea""...the album has become a family favorite. The music is clean and upbeat and can be enjoyed by Disney fans of all ages....Our family recommends this CD to any music lover."
4,Wow!,"I love Disney films and songs, I am 16 and have still haven't grown out of them thanks to this cd! As soon as I heard it the magic of Disney instantly came back to me! All the songs are really well done by the artists and I have recommended it to everyone I know. If you like Disney you will LOVE this CD, it is awesome!"
5,Great fun for a 4 year old!!,"My Disney-loving 4 year-old daughter heard this at a friend's house and LOVED it. Santa brought it, and she now listens to it all the time, singing and dancing all over the house. Disney classics, both old and not so old, sung by popular artists with contemporary rythms. Mom & Dad don't mind it either!"
3,Mediocre,"A decent album. I enjoy songs from Jessica Simpson's ""Part of that World"", Usher's ""You'll Be In My Heart"" and Christina Aguilera's ""Reflection"" (although I would have preferred a newly recorded version). But one of the major disappointments on this CD is Ashanti's cover of 'Colors of the Wind'. She does an OK job, but her heart is not in it. It makes me dread to listen to it. ... that this CD's goal is probably not to perfect and improve Disney classics, which is fine. And many covers are decent, some really good. It'll be fun for parents to listen to, and it will keep the kids interested in their favorite artists, singing classics."
5,I love this book,"While this book has many innovative ideas in it, it makes perfect sense. It is easy to read, although so full of great thoughts and inspirational concepts that I had to slow the pace just to digest it. It speaks to the heart and the process of reading is healing in itself. I highly recommend it to anyone searching for their hearts desire, or just plain looking for answers."
3,Helpful Update,Helpful update to restrictive traditional Christian belief systems. Supplementary to new information that is exploding now during the planetary Shift in vibrational dimension.
5,Truth is the word for this book!,"For a first time author, Glenda Green has yet another amazing gift, which she gives away to every reader who gets this book. What a refreshing truthful book, just in time for the new spiritual breeze that is upon us! This is a universal book, which touches the heart for everyoone that reads it. Sit back, get ready, and enjoy a new awakening!"
2,Confusing: Relative truth mixed in with Absolute Truth,"Really some great statements in this book. But if you are a CIM person..or of the non duality perspective, there may be a good bit in here that just does not fly. It depends how much sorting you want to do, to separate the wheat from the chaff."
5,Not just for Christians.,"This book is life changing! It is not just for Christians. I am a Druid and I love this book. It is for anyone on the spiritual path seeking a higher level of awareness. It teaches one to be in their heart space and experience who they really are: LOVE. From this place, one can create a more beautiful and fulfilling life by directing the ""GOD"" particles or Adamantine particles that exist in everything. We are but scratching the surface of our potential. This book leads you to a totally new way of Being."
5,Excellent transaction!,Thank you for the excellent sale - - I received the book in a timely manner and in excellent condition. Thanks!
2,"Brings to mind ""Conversations with God""...","This book brings to mind ""Conversations with God"". The Author is very ""wordy"" and psuedo-philosophical. The entire book lacks inspiration and insight. If she did indeed meet the ""real"" Jesus she fails to relate and express this phenomenon intimately and ""spiritually"" to the reader. Not impressed."
1,BE WARNED!,"The ""jesus"" that wrote this book is not the true Jesus of the Bible. Jesus of the Bible Himself warned about ""jesus"" like this coming to deceive people. Please read Matthew 24 in the Bible. For a better understanding/exposure of what is going on, please read the book ""Reinventing Jesus Christ"" by Warren B Smith. I cover myself and all that are working to expose such deceptions as these, with the precious blood of the one and the only true Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God. May we never be deceived in Jesus name. Amen."
1,delusionary author needs to change her meds,"The author has an occasional interesting thought about things spiritual, but most readers will get quickly bored with the whole question and answer premis. I found it laughable that she believes that Jesus came to her so she could paint his picture over a number of months. Apparently she has never heard of digital cameras.Save yourself the money and just read your Bible."
5,Tremendous read!,"This book drew me in from the first page and held me to the last. It answered many of those questions from bible studies which began ""I wonder what was meant by the word/statement . . . ."" Highly recommended!"
5,Profound guide,"I find this book to be packed with information on the nature of reality. Unlike my experience with many books on spirituality, I find myself returning to this book again and again. The truths that Jesus reveals in modern American English hit home whether he is explaining the nature of the heart, the physics of the universe or the ten commandments. Here is revealed both the deep love of Jesus for all people and an unflinching guide to all of life. All of this is presented free from dogma, free from religiosity, and free from condemnation."
5,Just beautiful,"The warmth, love, compassion, wisdom and joy that radiate from this book is, at times, overwhelming! For me, this is a book that one must keep so that it can be referred to time and again, as I simply am not spiritually advanced enough to get most of the information on a first, second and maybe even third pass. I hope to hear Glenda speak some day and I'd love to see her painting up close and personal. Buy the book and cherish it!"
5,Love Without End by Glenda Greene,"My ex-husband recently died from Lou Gehrig's disease. He left this book as his legacy. I would not have made it through his death without the wonderful words from this book. It gave me the explanation as to why such a wonderful person could suffer from such a horrible disease. It gave me the inspiration to go on without the love of my life in it to share with. I open the book all the time just to hear the words that Jesus left us to help us through the trying times in life. It is the most wonderful and inspirational book I have ever read. I recommend this book to everyone in time of need. Please, tell all your friends about the book, it will lift their spirits and give them a reason to live life to it's fullest and to ""live life in love."" I know that was Jesus' message to me and this book has changed my life."
4,Mailing Envelopes at a Fair Price,A good product at a fair price. I'm tired of people overchanging us but this is a good deal.
3,"Interesting, but very draggy","Linda Grant is a writer that draws you right into a particular family and historical time. There was great potential for this book, but it got off track as the protagonist went to NY from Liverpool and had two very lengthy relationships where nothing much happened. In the second, she gets absorbed into the world of Communism, but on a pretty superficial level, and the meetings/activities/related to that seem to carry the entire second half of the book and go on for way too long. By book's end, we're not sure there's a fully-developed person there, though she's in her 60s. Can't say I liked Sybille Ross (the protagonist) or even felt much for her given her decisions, values (or lack thereof) and life trajectory. Her identifications with a Jewish father and a German mother during and after WWII would have been much richer territory and given Sybille more depth and interest."
2,Impossible instructions,The instructions are not in English and are very vague and are not labeled well.
5,kettler trim station,"I looked and shopped locally for a swingset for my granddaughter, and was disappointed with the low quality, Chinese made product I found. I looked at Amazon and found this combination swing/gym set made in Germany. It is very strong, superior engineered, powder coated steel set. It requires some work assembling, and you have to dig 6 holes and fill with cement, but it is worth the work. The hardest part is leveling, but this is a quality product. I give it 5 stars. Gary. Riverside Calif."
4,"""jungle gym""",Fairly easy to put together. Our 7 year old has not been off of it since assembly! We were looking for something a little more challenging and fun than a typical wood swing set (because of her age). So far so good.
1,CD Has Only 1 Good Song!,"I saw this in a store and I wasted my money buying it! This CD is terrible, the only halfway decent song that you can even want to dance to is The Hustle, the other songs are horrible and boring! I made a much better decision when I bought Pure Disco Vol. 1, and Pure Disco Vol. 2, they have much better Disco songs!"
4,A good choice for the purpose,"This is a nice little machine; easy to use and fairly quick. There's a certain amount of trouble involved. You have to make sure the canister is thoroughly frozen and the ice cream mixture is chilled, which means you have to think way ahead. But it's not that difficult. It doesn't really make a lot of ice cream, so if you want a lot, real quick, then go to the supermarket. But for that homemade taste, this is a good choice, and it's enough for about four people. I'm glad I got it."
3,ice creram maker,Purchased this after reviewing many other similiar in size. This was the cheapest in price. It did make great ice cream but you must freeze container and your mix over night. Mine never got thicker than a milkshake but froze into ice cream. It would really depend on your recipe as with any ice cream maker. It is just small. Enough for 2-3 adults.
4,very happy with this product,we ordered this product and were very impressed on how easy it was to use and clean up after being used.I was very portable and is the right size for a family of three people.
2,Disappointed,"These shoes looked so nice in the pictures; but are a POS in reality. Well, maybe they are not that bad. But still I decided to never again buy shoes online. Would try the red ones though."
3,Works sometimes,It works sometimes but it feels extremely fragile and I honestly have no idea what the switch on the side does. It's just trial an error because it's all marked in Chinese.
1,what a sucks stuff!!,I bought it a week ago. when I received it there is no instruction in English at all. ALL THE WORDS ARE CHINESE!! And IT WORKS ONLY TWO TIMES. The third time it doesn't work at all. I can't believe it already broken in just one week!!!
4,Working great for the price I paid,I left my both mobile/camera chargers at my home country. Now this one charger was working for my both (mobile/digital camera) batteries.
1,Battery charger,"I didn'y receive an instruction book with the product, I was told it would charge a V3 battery but I can't get it to work. You get what you pay for."
4,Blast from the past,"If you're a fan of the seventies and of ""soft rock"" this is a must own. I was only aware of a few of the tracks by name, however it's surprising how many tracks were familiar. Many songs slip into the cracks of time. This is the sort of album that has a nostalgic feel if you are from the era or if not just a great album to kick back and enjoy."
2,Gets Redundant After A While,"At the time when I picked this book up, I thought it was an intriguing subject; to juxtapose these thinkers arguments and try to form somewhat of a debate. Unfortunately, the author seems to say everything he can make out of their writings & lives within the first couple of chapters. Afterwards you're just left reading the same thing over & over again. I would suggest reading their individual works if you want something more stimulating. However, this may be a good starter book if you know nothing about either person."
5,"Brilliant, fascinating, lucid","Dr. Nicholi does a brilliant job of comparing and contrasting the writings and ideas of two very important modern thinkers.The author's lucid and lively writing successfully brings out the practical implications of the different views of Lewis and Freud on love, sex, death, and God. Dr. Nicholi has taken complex subject matter and made it very accessible and interesting."
3,Mixed bag,"Overall, I enjoyed the author's ability to negotiate the lives and teachings of Lewis and Freud. This book is a good way to encounter both thinkers, though it is necessarily a very brief introduction.As for theological/philosophical perspective, I found Freud a very dissapointing advocate for atheism. Having once been one myself, I recall more convincing (or at least more universally relevant) arguments against God than Freud offers. The treatment of Lewis, in contrast, is encouraging, entertaining, enlightening, and the exposition of his theology is very convincing. Sadly, many chapters include much more of Freud than Lewis.In all, a decent book, but I recommend just reading some of Lewis's works if you want to learn about his thoughts. If you want a brief treatment of both, then this book is for you."
5,"Brilliant exposition of the ""world view"" question","Drawing upon the vast corpus of written work left by two of the world's brightest thinkers, the author carefully assembles answers to life's most essential quesitons. ""What is happiness, and how can I attain it?""...""How can I come to terms with pain, suffering, and death?"" Two answers to each of these (and other) questions--one each from Freud and Lewis--bring these crucial problems into bold relief. A stroke of genius to use the lives and works of these two very different men for this purpose.The author's expertise on the biographies of the two men add much to the mix. An essential read for every thoughtful human being."
5,Gripping Exploration,"For those interested in the lives and theories of Lewis and Freud, this book is a must-read. It's a fine and sensitive introduction to both men's theories and lives. While some may not agree with Nicholi's method of comparing philosophies with life-adherence or happiness, it's still a very stimulating and refreshing approach. Nicholi is a fine writer as well as a psychologist.This book treats the theories of two great men, but shows two paths of life in many important issues of life. Anyone seeking deeper insight into modernity and Christianity should peruse here as well."
2,blah blah blah,"This book may be interesting to people who have never read or thought about Lewis or Freud, but otherwise it is just like reading pop psychology. Lewis thought this, blah blah blah, Freud thought this, blah blah blah. And, the writer is a Christianity sympathizer who obviously has bias. This might be a great book for those who have never read anything beyond Psychology Today. Maybe high school kids... if there's any left who still read books."
1,Using Freud as a front.,"Without reading the reviews I started this book. Have only heard half, but after a feigned objectivity it is blatantly biased. It is a book contrasting three people actually; Freud, Lewis before and Lewis after his conversion.Already it is obvious the author is making a case for happiness being exclusive to those that believe. He contrasts Lewis in the last part of his life with Freud and the younger Lewis. It is easy to skew any look at Freud simply because he is open and honest about any assertions he could make against the existence of a superior being.If you are looking for an unbiased comparison of the two men, look elsewhere. The author simply uses Freud to assert a favorable view of Lewis. Of course, if in the last half of the book the author leans again toward objectivity I will amend this assessment."
2,Mild Christian Propaganda,"Just finished this book. I almost tore it up twice. All the little snide, smug comments really started to get at me. I am no athiest, and I am certainly no Christain but this Doc can't seem to put 2 and 2 together. If 80% or whatever it is believe in God, and at least 30% will become depressed in their lifetime, then Freud's position is not inferior to Lewis. The Author definetly has a disposition towards Lewis, my suggestion is to skip this brainwash scrub and go right to the source and read either Freud or Lewis, whichever one feats your fancy."
2,Ad hominem ad nausem,"Other reviews said it before, so I shall be brief: this book is sold as a fairly balanced review of ideas, but that is a sham. From the first chapter, it is obvious that Lewis is better viewed by the author, while Freud suffers both gratuitous personal attacks and critical commentary(albeit usually superficial, which simply compounds the problem) from the author (whereas Lewis sales through areas begging for questioning; the author would have no such thing!). A waste of money."
2,zydeco: The Essential Collection,I guess I ordered the wrong Zydeco CD. This one is OK or less. Has a few good songs on it. I would not purchase this one again
2,a bit of a let down..,"If you love house music you won't be dissapointed as i was. I expected this to be less house and more chill. There are a few tracks that are unique enough to keep the cd, but given an opportunity to review the entire cd I would not have bought a second time."
3,"Great Software, but not for Vista","Mastercook is a great product. I already owened version 8.0 which did not work with my new Vista software. I purchased this version because the Ad indicated it was compatable with Vista. The box did not indicate this, and it is not.If you are running another system you will love it. The ability to pull in recipes from the web and other word processing systems is great. I have used it for several years and was very pleased until I had to purchase a new tower, and it came loaded with Vista. With Vista you can't pull in ingredients lists either from websites or word processors."
5,Best Recipe Software Ever!,I absolutely love this software. It is very easy to use and gives complete information about each recipe. It has so many features. One of my favorites is the recipe import assistant. It makes getting recipes from emails and web pages so easy -- no typing required!! Plus you can take pictures and add them to each recipe as well as pictures of the step by step preparations. I highly recommend this product. I have used a previous version for years and this new version is even better.It is not designed for Windows Vista but I am using it on my HP laptop with Windows Vista.
4,MasterCook,I do like this program. I have it set up on my laptop and use it in addition to looking up recipes on the internet. I have this available in my kitchen 24 hours a day and it's so easy to use even my 9 year old used this program for cooking.
4,Great Recipe source,This is a CD Rom. I really like that the software is not limited to one time install like a few others on the market. The recipes are accurate and it also allows you to place a few of your own in.
3,Just started using it - still not sure,"I have not had any software problems but the program is not the most intuitive or easy to use.It takes a while to enter recipes into the program. Perhaps there is a better way of doing it, but I have not found it. So far, I have just cut-and-paste from websites. I think the recipes they have in the program are pretty much worthless, so definitely do not buy it for those! They seem to be a compilation from different manufacturers, for example, one recipe calls for ""big chief sugar.""Once you get the recipes in there, you can add them to a shopping list. It is nice to be able to sort the shopping list by category. The problem is that the shopping list has redundant items, like ground black pepper, fresh ground pepper. And, of course, sugar and ""big chief sugar."" I printed my list and it was 3 pages. That seemed excessive. I need to format the list so it isn't so long! I don't want to flip through 3 pages at the grocery store."
1,MasterCook 9 not compatible with Vista,"I've used an older version of MasterCook for years and loved it. Recently, I purchased a new computer with the Vista operating platform. The older version of MasterCook would not work on it so I checked Amazon to see if there was a newer version available which would be compatible with Vista, and was thrilled to see that Amazon indicated that version 9 would work. I purchased it, installed it, and had a lot of problems. While attempting to learn why the new software wasn't working properly, I just learned that Amazon has listed the product information incorrectly. The software manufacturer, ValueSoft, indicated in their HELP guide that MasterCook 9 is not compatible with Vista...so BEWARE. I am very very disappointed both with ValueSoft for not keeping up with software advances and with Amazon for incorrectly listing the product."
1,MasterCook Deluxe 9.0 not for Vista,"MasterCook Deluxe 9.0 was advertised by Amazon as Vista compatable. The Manufacture, ValuSoft, does not advertize is as Vista compatible and I could not get it to print. Also I could not find a call in number for any support. I tried to run MasterCook in the Xp mode of Vista and could not get the print function to work. I have trouble with MasterCook and other programs to run in the XP mode under Vista. Amazon customer service did stand behind their advertizement and did refund the cost of the product."
3,Hard to navigate,"Needs more pictures, hard to enter your own recipes, frustating to use. Does not work well with Vista. Excellent variety and number of recipes."
2,Master Cook Deluxe,"Received product with no user manual. Purchased item so could transfer my wife's personal recipe book from an older version. New version fails to recognize the older version, as advertised.Requested technical support on line twice. Have never had a response."
4,Great Tool,"Aside from the vast library of recipes, shopping and nutrition tools that this product offers, this software is great for people who have family recipes, who like to invent their own dishes or re-invent them. You can produce a cookbook with all of those beloved recipes and it can include the nutritional value as well (Watch out, you will find out just how loaded with fat and calories mom's home cooking really was). I also like that you can recalculate the portion size of the recipes and it will recalculate your shopping list.The only reason that I give it a 4 and not a 5 is because it's not a beautifully designed interface. You are getting a lot of utility and flexibility here in exchange though.If you are kind of a techie, you should consider this software a 5. It's very flexible in terms of it's architecture and database set up."
3,More difficult navigation than MC2,"This was to be an upgrade from Master Cook II, because I got a new computer with Vista. The basic program contains more recipes, but the navigation is not at all intuitive. I'm having trouble transferring MC2 files to the personal recipes cookbook as well. I guess this is to be expected with the upgrade??? to Vista."
3,Master Cook Software,"A very reasonably priced software & easier to use than most. I'm from the old school of wanting a printed manual but there isn't any. Luckily most things are fairly easy to figure out, although sometimes the help file is needed. The most difficult part was figuring out how to share recipes with someone via email. The help file on this wasn't detailed enough and a lot of trial & error was needed. It was rather annoying. I would still recommend Master Cook but be prepared to work out how to use parts of it."
2,MasterCook Software,"I was disappointed with the software. It is not as intuitive as I thought it woold be. It is not what I was looking for - an easy to use source of new receipes, but with the ability to accept my recipes with minimum hassle. I will spend more time with it and will probably find that that, once thru the learning curve, it will do all I want and more, but out of the box, it was not real friendly."
4,Import recipes from web pages - great new feature!,"I have used Mastercook programs for years but have found the recent versions to be a bit awkward to navigate. Version 9 is an improvement with some nice added features. I especially like the web import tool. It was a little difficult to find it and get it working with Internet Explorer, but well worth the trouble. Once you open the tool in IE you simply highlight portions of an online recipe, mark what the text is (title, instructions, picture, etc) and then import directly to Mastercook. I love this new feature. If you have an older version, it is worth upgrading. If you have never tried Mastercook and are looking for recipe software, this version is a good one for the price. It comes with many recipes and you can easily add your own or collect new ones online!"
3,Program- Master Cook 9.0,Did not use on my newer computer. Works with older computer.Sure it is a great program since newer version is great.All transaction in ordering and receiving went well.
3,"Good for the price, will not import with new browsers",I've used this software for 2 years now. I mostly liked it because it was easy to type in my old recipes to get nutritional information. I also used it to calculate the cost to make something from scratch vs buying it homemade. I really liked being able to import recipes off the internet but now with having to update my web browser (I put it off for as long as possible) it doesn't work. I will keep trying but just wanted to warn those who are looking to buy. There was a microsoft update in Oct 2010 that renders this software useless. You get error messages and it locks up. That update is KB2387149. The makers of this product are aware of it and have yet to fix it.Now I have to search for new cooking software. There is a newer version of this but have not read all the reviews on it yet.
3,Master Cook Deluxe software,"Seller was very friendly, good communication skills, helpful. I had trouble with first product bought ( no fault of seller in any way), but seller sent 2nd copy which worked on a different computer. Thanks mucho grande!"
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this after getting tired of handwriting my family's weekly menu thinking I could just find recipes and organize them using the calendar. First, the recipes are not great. They claim over 8,000 recipies and only 150 are listed under ""kid-friendly"". And what are they? Pizza with this, Pizza with that. Not very creative. The calendar feature is not at all user friendly. The shopping list is fine, although doesn't do a great job of merging, so you have a few different entries for ""boneless chicken"" depending on whether the recipe uses lbs or number of breasts. I think I'll go back to just looking through cookbooks and handwriting out the menu for the week. Just not worth the hassle."
2,Limited export abilities,"Doesn't export in any useable format. You can only export recipes in text or MasterCook format, you can't export into MS Word format to backup or share a collection of your recipes or menus--you can email them out."
3,MasterCook Deluxe Vol 9.0,It was very good for the price. I would have liked to add some of my graphics and/or pictures when working with my own personal recipes but was not able to. It was easy to work with. I want to do my own personal cook book to give to my grandchildren and I do not feel this program can do that for me yet this is a good program.
3,Wouldn't call it Deluxe,"This was an upgrade for me from a past version. I like the software and the upgrades made. However, the conversion provide to merge in my old data didn't work and getting help from the company didn't happen. I did figure out how to do it, but not with what they provide me."
4,Master cook deluxe,"My goal purchasing the Mastercook Deluxe was to transfer my existing recipes to the program. I find I don't use the cookbooks given, but I mostly put in the recipes that I have. The down side is I have to manually enter the recipes rather than just transfer files. The positive side is that now my recipes are entered and I can include pictures and descriptions. There is an auto complete button that makes entering items easier. I would recommend anyone trying to organize recipes to use a computer program."
3,Master Cook Deluxe 9,Frankly I was quite disappointed in this product. I had to ask on line to even find out where to download the Tutorials! I'm very disappointed that I cannot easily scan written recipes into the program. I'm not a computer novice and I did not find it user friendly. The cookbooks included are great as is the nutritional anaysis.
1,Of little use,This was difficult to install and wanted to install old versions of Adobe Reader and Quicktime Player.Most of the receipts did mot have photos of the dish. I would not use this product if was free.
3,"Beware of phony ""free shipping""",I think it really sucks to say an item qualifies for free shipping and then charge for shipping.John
2,disapointed,"I am very disapointed in this product. while i'm sure it is an excellent product and will do everything that i have been told it will do. without some sort of usage manual, i an totally lost! i have been able to do a few things, but not without spending considerable time hunting and pecking, when with a manual i would have been able to fully use this product in a timly manner. contact with tha makers has left me at a dead end. respectfully, judy"
1,Technical support,"Technical support for this product is non-existent. They refer you to the web site of many other complaints or suggestions, but never address your particular problem. I have used other versions of MasterCook for years without a problem. Someone needs to address specific problems, not just generic suggestions. I would not buy this product again!"
4,Good Receipes,"The order came as advertised and it works just the way it was supposed to. We are very happy with this product.Thanks,"
3,Long time user,"I'm not sure that the previous version of MasterCook that I used was written by this company, but I purchased this version to run on Vista. The interface is completly different from the previous one.This product has many cookbooks included and if you can't find the recipe you are looking for it I would be suprised.I bought Mastercook to manage the recipes for my catering company and although entering and scaling them is easy, I'm not satisfied with the printed output. There is only one print form and even though you can move the elements around to different positions on the page, it is labor intensive and time consuming. And I haven't found a way to save the new form as a template.If the all knowing government every forces me to put ingredients and nutritional values on my menu, then this program will make that possible."
3,Disappointed,"I am a MasterCook user for about the last 5 or 6 years. Was excited to see the new version had compatibility with my palm pilot. Was sooo disappointed when I got an error message the first time I tried to use that feature. I can't see any improvements over the version I was using previously, which was about four years old. So disappointed."
3,MasterCook Results,"First I really love the idea behind the program.They were several items that were not on the basic menu such as eggs, splenda, spenda blend etc, so a lot of addtional work was needed torevise recipes.But I still love the program as I am a bariatric surgey person andit made my life easier when making recipes.Thanks"
1,Forget the PDA compatibility,"I first bought version 8.0 of this software, only to find that it didn't work on my LifeDrive Palm. It wasn't easy to get hold of technical support, but after about 2 weeks and a lot of going round they told me that this product does not work with OS 5.4. It would have been nice to know this before I purchased it, because being able to export shopping lists and recipes to my Palm was the main reason I purchased this particular software. I bought version 9.0 and found that the problem still has not been corrected."
2,No Instructions!!!,"I haven't had the time to figure out this software. It doesn't come with instructions, like most software does, so the user is left to learn it on their own."
2,Cookbook - not so good,This program has not been useful to me. Not well thought out.I would not suggest it to you.
2,just ok,I bought this to get some unique ideas. It's doesn't have much I would use.I have more luck just browsing the internet. I would say I was disappointed.
2,Mastercook is Half-Baked,"It seems like a great idea, and with abundant recipes it contains a wealth of culinary genius, like an Incan temple buried under layers of hastle.Mastercook nine is a sloppy interface without the rudimentary connectivity that modern users expect from the iPhone or the Xbox live. The idea of a truely comprehensive and convenient recipe database is brilliant, and Mastercook is hands above the best product so far. But it needs a sharp jolt, and a wake-up call to get with the times.This product could reign supreme, but could easily be left behind if it continues to lolly-gag for another 9 editions."
1,"Used to be the king of recipe software, but you were abandoned","Mastercook used to be the king of recipe software, but it has been abandoned by it's publisher/developer, and if you have or plan on updating your PC that runs anything newer than WIndows 98/ME/XP, don't buy this program. It will not run correctly, period. READ the system requirements on the website or box. You have been warned"
2,Barely Adequate,I've used MasterCook for over 5 years now and have developed workarounds to most of its limitations. I wish ValuSoft would invest in an upgrade. My biggest gripe is that I bought a Palm Pilot primarily to export shopping lists to only to discover that MasterCook doesn't support newer versions of the Palm operating system. So I spent over a hundred dollars on a device my twenty dollar software can't talk to. Major bummer. I'm too dependent on my Palm Pilot now for other things so I still have to print shopping lists to carry to the grocery store with me.I also find the print design module very difficult to use. I suppose I shouldn't expect too much from such inexpensive software but the tools are really clunky.I keep hoping ValuSoft will come out with an upgrade soon. I'll eventually be forced to move to Vista the next time I buy a computer so I hope there will be a better MasterCook available at that time.
4,Best I've found,"I had a very old version (version 2) and was looking to upgrade. I first bought a different product that cost twice as much, but was disappointed with the many bugs in the software. I then read some reviews and bought this. Big improvement in the stability of the software as well as the features. I found it to be fairly intuitive to use.I would like to change a few things, like being able to export to a CSV or delimited text format so I could compile my own recipe books externally. I would also like to be able to customize the views more, such as viewing certain fields as columns in the cookbook or recipe list view so I don't have to always go to the search function.I have found the import function works quite well. I especially like the Internet Explorer browser plug-in so I can import recipes right off web pages without having to save them as text first.Very nice software.Addendum:MasterCook 9 imported my old MC ver 2 cookbooks flawlessly and easily."
1,"Very, Very Poor Customer Service","I've been using MasterCook for quite a while now and while I find it pretty simple to use and fairly good for organizing recipes, their customer service stinks really badly.I've contacted them several times and never, not once, got a reply back. And one occasion was pretty traumatic. I ""lost"" a cookbook with over 500 recipes in it, many family heirlooms completely irreplaceable. MasterCook could see it but couldn't open it. I sent them at least a half dozen e-mails requesting help, but heard nothing, not even ""we received your inquiry"".I continue to use their product but now keep hard copy, handwritten versions of all the recipes I enter because I don't want to lose any more."
1,Dud,"This single is just terrible.You get a radio edit of Supersonic, the 9.31 long Pete Heller Love Mix which is excruciatingly long and Harveys Fuel Altered Mix which is passable at best but equally as long. Save your money and buy the 8 track US version to at least get value for money in getting these songs and the others from the Supersonic cds."
4,Great Godzilla,"Godzilla just keeps getting better and this offering is very good. Creating a black hole in hopes of getting rid of Godzilla, scientists instead mutate a dragonfly which in turn lays eggs and the queen of these mutants grows huge due to radioactive energy aquired from Godzilla, and of course a giant monster battle insues. Great special effects and a good sci-fi story makes this one an instant classic."
3,Its Godzilla!!!,"If you compare this with ""Giant Monsters All-Out Attack"", you may be a lttle disappointed. But, overall its a fine ""popcorn"" movie. I think Kirko Tsujimori is an interesting character. (She is played by a very fine performer, Misato Tanaka).Character development is not a strong suite in Godzilla movies. But, her reason for chasing the BIG G, revenge, is clear.Special effects are adequate. The monster costumes are up to the Toho standards. The big battle scene has some interesting moments.Best sequence in the film is when Tsujimori climbs on the back of Godzilla to plant a tracking device. Tsujimori has plenty of spunk!!"
4,thrown together,god movie but in like almost all the megaguirus scenes you can see the strings holding him up
3,Short and Sweet,I would put this Godzilla entry in the same class with Space Godzilla and Destroyah even though the Godzilla monster is much improved.Godzilla 2000 and Gojira are still my two favorites!
3,Special effects?????,"I guess that now everyone knows Godzilla and he is a househole name.I cant understand why the damn special effects for this movie are so bad, and when i mean bad its bad.Compared to Gamera revenge of iris and the other gamera movies that where made at the end of 1999 that are well made and the special effects are amazing.In this Godzilla movie like all G movies the miniature well everything, look like small toys, jets, tanks, city..........The small Megagirus creatures look like plastic, its like they rushed threw the movie and didnt take any time or consideration for the special effects.If your a monster movie fan get the new Gamera, i am a Godzilla fan but its quit hard for me to stay loyale when Godzilla 2000 started off real good and started to have great special effect and now they are back to square one.Yag"
5,Since when was Big G the 'good guy' ?!?,"Anyone here actually watch the original Godzilla movie? He was bad. Good guys dont generally destroy cities and scorch the earth with atomic breath. Good guys dont usually eat screaming female victims.Gamera, on the other hand, is a good guy, or good turtle if you like.I liked this movie alot more than GMK: All Out Monster Attack, which was pretty cheezy, even with the good special fx.The release of G vs Mecha-G on DVD at the end of March 2004 will be something to look foreward to... its alot better than this movie also."
2,What could go wrong?,"Okay, we have the second ""Next Generation"" series movie, and it takes failure to whole new lows. True, Godzilla 2000(NOT a prequel to this movie), wasn't a great movie, but this is just AWFUL. Bad special effects, crappy monsters, and an overly simple story make this a movie to avoid like the plague. As far as DVDs go, this is a solid release of a really bad movie. If this IS your thing, however, check out ""Godzilla Vs Mechagodzilla III"" and ""Tokyo SOS,""which are built around a reworked version of this plot that actually works better that the original. Otherwise, don't waste your time and money..."
4,Great story-bad special effects!,One of the latest in the G series has some connections to past mostly around Godzilla attacks. It has a great story lots of ideas and fun characters BUT the effects wildly range from good to AWFUL! What happened!? If you compare the effects in this movie to G Vs. Meccha G the effects in that movie blow this one out of the water. There are wires on Magagurius!? Its 2004 people! EVEN THE 1964 FILMS had better effects than that. And Godzilla himself.. he's lifeless and dull. His face and movements are terrible.. no no. If you are going to spend all this money and time do it right!!!! But for story and characters and the odd good effects and there are a few I gave this movie probably more stars than it deserves.
1,godzilla should be a good guy,this new change of godzilla is depressing i have been a fan of him ever scince i was 3 and i loved him when he is a good guy. he is the protector of japan he shouldn't destroy it. stop changing godzilla make him like the origonal A GOOD GUY not a villan.
4,Enjoyable Godzilla Movie,"I hadn't seen this move prior to starting my long overdo collection. It's decent, Godzilla throws down in some memorable brawls... basically if you are into Godzilla collecting, you can't go wrong right, if you love G you've got to get them all."
3,Second Millenium,"While not a sequel to Godzilla 2000, the Big G returns to rid Tokyo of a big bug infestation - so he can stomp it flat in peace. This doesn't stop the military from trying to rid itself of Godzilla using a weapon that could destroy the world. Only real complaint is that it came in one of the ""slim"" cases so it gets lost in with the rest of the collection. But it is a romp as well as being well priced for collectiong."
3,Dissmal Sony Release,"This is one of the best Godzilla movies ever!!! The first Millennium G-film I ever saw ( on Sci-Fi). It is a huge improvement over ""Godzilla 2000"" and in my opinion should've been released in American theaters instead. This movie gives the feeling of the classic Godzilla films, but at the same time still has that modern awe that is much better than in disappointing ""Godzilla 2000"". and thankfully here it is in both English and Japanese 5.1 audio. However, as with most Sony releases there are no special features and a rather boring menu. The Region 2 DVD, which I also own, is much better with trailers, behind the-scenes-footage, interviews with the film makers as well as deleted scenes and more. if you're a simple sci-fi fan this decent, but if you're a real G-fan the region 2 DVD is the only real edition.Film itself: 5/5Sony DVD: 3/5Region 2 Toho DVD: 5/5"
4,change the settings and enjoy,enjoyed these movies as much as i did when i was a kid. Glad to see my grandson does too.
2,Not as good as it sounds,"For a modern Godzilla movie, the animation is very dissapointing. After seing Gamera 3 I was eager to see what Godzilla had to offer for 2000. Sadly it does not deliver.The special effects are bad and the fight scenes are very slow.This movie looks like it was made in the 70's.You want real Monster action? Try Gamera 3 or Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah!"
4,very good!!,this is an awsome godzilla movie i have a tivo when you can record stuff on t.v. well i record this on the dvr while it was playing on the sci-fi channel last week. the fights i thought nedded more blood and guts but overall it was a great flick!
3,"Fun fights, boring movie","I'm a long time Godzilla fan. I got this movie having heard mixed reviews, and after watching it I can tell why. The movie was pretty boring for the 40-50 minutes. Then the monster fighting began. The fighting was really alot of fun. Godzilla and Megaguirus are two very different kinds of monsters and it's fun to see their different abilities used against each other.I recommend this movie to any Godzilla fans. To the general movie going audience, however, I would recommend some of the other Godzilla movies with a more interesting (and serious) plot. Godzilla verse Megaguirus just isn't quite as good as the original Godzilla, Godzilla 1985, or Godzilla 2000."
3,Godzilla vs BIG BAD BUG,Godzilla is back again to terrorize tokyo of course but it seems like the G FORCE has a special weapon that would send godzilla in to another deminsion you can say.What goes wrong is that when there testing something came out of the black whole which is Megaguirus.All these creature begin breeding and feeding the mother but little they threaten by godzilla but most of them get destroyed that when the KING DADDY !!! of all of them comes out to destroy there victim.This godzilla flick is indeed good they use the same suit as in G2k and the monster action was good and so was the spx but they could did a little bit better on the plot and not leave so many dead scenes.But i recommend you get it because its indeed good
2,some good action but like no snake,"this movie was ok, defineitly better than boa vs. python and pythons 2, but still not to good. a prison in antatica is just being made and the engineers dig a hole to deep and wake the snake. it comes out and starts eatin people. then a group of soldiers come in along with cain and his wife, 2 scientists who for some reason are brought along. then the soldiers are running after it to try and kill it and then the snake kills all of them. so now its cain his wife and the warden and the prisoners tryin to get out of their. this movie had some good shooting scenes and action but u barely saw the snake and when u did u say lik parts of him or his head for lik 2 seconds. but the snake is pretty kool hough, its similar to the one in python but its a different color. this movie isnt rely worth watching but its not bad if u lik creature movies, but if not, its not rely worth it."
2,Very good story ruined by low budget and bad directing!,"Just read the Description behind the DVD or in amzon.com or yahoo.com! You'll be tantalized to watch this movie and after watching it, you'll regret of wasting your time! the story is great but the movie is terrible! I'm really sorry for Dean Cane cause after starring in the role of Super-man in great Louise & Clark TV series, accepts to play in such movies!2 Stars is only for the good plot! and I hope, someday a good director with enough bugdet make a good movie on it!"
1,Giant snake vs. Dean Cain; as stupid as it sounds...,"""Boa"" isn't the worst movie ever. Actually, yes it is. This movie from director Phillip Roth (Velocity Trap, Falcon Down) is a triumph in bad filmmaking. It's predictable every step of the way, right down to how the giant snake is going to tear its prey apart. It's about as likable as ""It's Pat: The Movie,"" only a little funnier. The special effects are terrible, hard to see, and very confusing at times. UFO LLC usually has some pretty sweet effects in their flicks, but this movie is different. It suffers from minimal visibility and a terrible lack of anything scary, let alone coherent, in the film. At least Dean Cain got a paycheck. As long as he's making a movie, I suppose the world is a better place. As long as it's not ""Boa 2: Snakes Alive."""
3,"Not too terrible, if you like low-budget sci-fi","This is about a giant snake that terrorizes the staff and prisoners (all 4 of them) at the world's most high-security prison, located in Antarctica. If you're a fan of low budget movies where ""suspension of disbelief"" is pretty much synonymous with ""suspension of all thought processes"", you may get a kick out of this. The acting isn't especially bad, the characters are basically likable, and the snake is bargain basement CGI. The sets and overall atmosphere are really the best part of the movie. The action moves along at a more or less acceptable pace, and the climax is so laughably stupid that you'll probably be telling people at work about it the next day.Overall, not an especially good B-movie, but considering some of the utter garbage that's out there in the direct-to-video market these days, you could do much, much worse."
5,Boa is a hit,I think that the BOA movie could have been better yes but it was a well written movie. The effects were well done and the film its self has very good parts as well.
3,Not enough screen time for the snake,"Boa is a better story than python, but the main title creaturedoesn't get as much screen time as the snake in python, it isa decent little popcorn movie, don't expect too much and youmight be happy on a rainy saturday night. If you buy thisalso buy python and enjoy a giant snake doubleheader."
3,"Horrible acting, okay movie.","These snake movies are gettin' old fast! The snake was sorta cool and the kills were alright. But the ACTING...OH MAN! So weak...so weak... Giant snake! What will we do? Well, Dean Cain, I'll tell ya what ya do: ya stand there, mouth hangin' wide open, and scream, sounding like [an] [idiot]!But the movie isn't so bad. The plot is okay. A little silly, but okay. What do you expect from a B horror snake movie?The DVD isn't bad either. It gives you a TEASER TRAILER, AUTO COMMENTARY, and some more stuff. I guess if you're lookin' for cheese city you can rent this. Because if you're lookin' for cheese city (that's just a term I use for a real cheesey horror film) you've reached your destination. (13 year old viewer)"
4,sure,"Boa was entertaining and exciting, but the computer effects weren't as realistic as Python's and Anaconda's."
2,Atleast it made me laugh,"This movie was so bad it made me laugh with it's inconsistencies. They even had fake snow which was OBVIOUSLY some kind of cottony blanket like material (like what they use in department storefront windows at Christmas time). The other thing that had me rolling on the floor laughing was the way the ""boa"", that supposedly needed warmth, survived in subzero temps.The bad language Dean Cain uses in this movie further detracts from the already bad acting. This movie is destined for MST3K reruns."
1,The worst snake movie ever! [...],"I saw this crap on the sci-fi channel the other day, and I was disapointed. The plot is pretty cool, but the action sucks, and the snake is hardly in the movie. Do yourself a favor, and don't buy this movie, it is boring and stupid. The two snake movies I would recommend are Anaconda, and Python 2."
3,A great bad movie,"Let me assume that you allready know that BOA is a very bad movie. Let me also assume that you are fan of bad movies for there is no other reason to even consider buying BOA on DVD. What makes Boa great is that you can tell that the filmakers tried to make something good and just failed miserbly. The movie is very funny and the humor is almost completly unintentional. Let me share with you one of the highlights.After shooting one of thier own men, the military guys think they have the snake trapped. They shoot at it hitting a gas line which sits on fire for about a minute without exploding. That is just enough time for the boa to excape and the entire security crew to show up and die when the gas line finally does explode.The rest of the movie has the same type of stupidity to it. Boa is easily the funniest of the big snake movies. Oh my god! I almost forgot, DEAN CAIN is in the movie. Dean Cain!!!"
4,good for teaching cause and effect,My 3 month old loves this toy. It keeps him occupied for about 15 minutes. What I love is that he gets to to learn cause and effect. You can see the excitement in his eyes. There is one design flaw. The baby can't see the cause and effect lying on his back. It works very well when I place him on his Boppy pillow.
5,"Looked great, Baby doesn't seem to enjoy it much***Edited***","We begged for this crib toy. But Baby isn't very interested. She will play with it for a minute or two, but really prefers her Aquarium (best crib toy!). I think she gets frustrated with it because the keys aren't positioned quite right for her hands or feet. She also tries to push the lights to make it work, but the sensors aren't under the lights. I think the setup confuses her a little. We also put it on the floor to see if she would like it there, no such luck.***edited*** Okay, now at 8 months she likes it. We pulled it out the other day and set it on the floor. She giggles every time the animal noises come on, especially when I imitate them. (I never thought I would be oooh-oooh-ooohing like an ape!) She has now figured out how to get the noises to work and will crawl across it to hear them. It is holding up really well, considering she lies on it and crawls on it. Maybe she just needed to be a little older."
1,disappointed,"We loved the kick and drive gym, so we wanted to find another toy our sons could kick and watch lights and hear music. Unfortunately, they weren't able to see the lights when lying on their backs. They didn't really like this toy."
1,Not what I expected,I expected an easy to kick toy for the crib so my son could work out his leg muscles and learn cause and effect. This was not the answer. It wasn't high enough for him to kick and he lost interest. The music was mediocre and he just didn't like it. I feel like this was a waste of money.
3,skymommy,"We didn't put this toy in my son's crib because he never played with it or kicked it. It was hard for him to see it while lying on his back. We also thought it would distract the baby from sleeping in the crib, which is what the crib is for! We put the piano on the floor and he loved it! As my son started to stand up, we attached the piano to the fence that blocks our entertainment center. He stopped trying to get past the fence and decided it was more fun to play with the piano instead."
5,"Baby doesn't quite ""get"" what's going on, but likes it!","My baby loves to kick and kicking this toy gives an immediate and exciting response! I really can't tell you if hearing ""A--Ape"" ""B-Bear"" ""C-Cat,"" etc and the accompanying animal noises will help him to learn those words/letters, but it really entertains him. A short little tune plays after the animal sound. If the kick lands toward the bottom of the pad, instead of ""C-Cat"", you may hear ""Three"" and then three musical tones. It's fun and it's a good way to get a baby who doesn't necessarily like being in the crib to forget he's in the crib for a while."
3,Better for older kids,"We purchased this toy for our baby girl before she turned one. But we found that the crib ""kicking"" setup didn't work as pictured. She really didn't use it until she was around 2. And then she decided it would also be fun to walk and jump on while on the floor. At this age 2-3 now two of our girls have used it and it is extremely durable. They literally jump on it and it keeps on working. It has a couple of modes of play that allow it to long play songs or act more like a piano. The kids love both."
1,not interesting to my child,"This toy was never a hit with my baby, and even now when she is two she never ever played with it. Sometimes she enjoyed listening to the tunes but you can get that from any other music instrument. The fact that the lights are ABOVE the key boards was confusing to her when she was little and she kept pushing the lights, which of course produced nothing. Also, the elephant sound scared her. I would not buy it. It also started to make funny sounds after a while - not durable."
2,New Mom,I loved this product. My infant loved it too. Then came the day it stopped working and back it went.
2,Does not attach to crib well,"This is a very cute toy, but the skimpy strings you have to use to attach it to the crib are awful. The piano constantly slides down and crumples up between the mattress and crib rails. It's a much better toy when used for tummy time."
4,Kick & Can't See...,"Our baby boy loves the lights and music - but if we place it so he can kick the keys, he can't see the lights. We ended up turning him to the side and playing it for him. As a passive toy to stare at - it's great. The counting and animal features are just ok."
2,Looses attention,My 6 month old looses interest in this easier than in other toys he has. Not real impressed by this toy.
1,This toy STINKS!,"When I bought this for my son I thought it would be a great toy. However, it worked for one day and then never turned on again. I changed the batteries, fooled with the settings and it never turned on again. We finally just threw it away."
2,Broke very easily,"I bought this before my son was born and attached it to the end of his crib like in the picture. He would kick it randomly from birth but never understood it was his kicking that did it and he couldn't see the piano to see the lights. I only turned it on a few times and then soon the first mode was broken and wouldn't work at all. It just makes a continous clicking sound. Then I tried using it on the floor for tummy time and he'd get tired of it very quickly. I tried it again when he learned to sit up and he still couldn't care less. I also think the sound quality is very poor and some of the animal sounds don't even sound like the animal they are, especially the bear. A lot of today's toys have very clear sounds to them and this one just doesn't compare. I love Fisher Price and most of their other products, this one was just a dud. I wish I hadn't bought it before he was born because by the time I realized he hated it, it was way too late to return it."
3,"Cute toy, but gets annoying!",We much prefer the Ocean Wonders Aquarium. This got annoying with my daughter waking us up in the middle of the night when she touched it and the animals made noise. The aquarium is soothing music which we like much better.
5,good toy that has lasted and is still used!,we received this toy at my baby shower. it was one of the few 'electronic' toys that we received because i didn't register for any. i did not put it in my daughter's crib but used it during morning play time on her back and on her belly. she used to giggle at the animal sounds. now she is 10 months old and crawls over to it on the floor and can play the buttons like a piano or still laugh at the animal sounds. this was a great gift that has definitely lasted!
3,Lots of fun for baby but.........,"My baby loves this toy - and I love that he loves this toy. It's very entertaining & he often falls asleep playing it. However, I had to take my first one back & I'm going to have to take my second one back as well because of the same problem - after about a month or so, the toy gets a spot in it where it skips, so the same part of a song plays over & over & over again until you turn it off - very annoying. (normally, the toy stops playing songs after awhile on its own) Also, it would be nice if there was volume control - it's a little loud."
4,Fun for a little while,"I purchased the Kick and Learn piano for my son when he was about 3 months old and was kicking a lot. I read a lot of good reviews about it so I decided to try it out. He likes this toy, before he started rolling over and was getting more mobile, he would kick the piano in his crib for 5-10 minutes a day. Now, I've taken it out of his crib since he's 9 months old and crawling. However, the best thing my son likes about this toy are the yellow strings that are supposed to tie the piano to the crib. He pulls on them and sucks on them more than he plays the piano. I wish the strings were long enough to all connect to each other so I could tie them behind the piano, but they're just too short. Right now, he'll play with the piano for a little bit when I pull it out once in awhile, but he has other toys he enjoys more. I do like this toy, though, the music is really cute and the speaking voice (for ABC and animal sounds) is educational."
3,Ok Toy for an Active Infant,"My daughter never really got into kicking this toy to play the music. Now that she's 8 1/2 months old, she is amused by it for a few minutes, but then she's on to something else. I think it's a fun toy, but if you have a very active infant you'll probably not want to buy this toy. It's pretty durable, though, and I haven't had any of the problems with skipping music that the previous reviews have mentioned. I would prefer to have a volume control on the sound."
5,Not just for kicking,"I got this when my son was less than two months, and used it a lot to encourage his kicking. I never hung it in his crib, but simply held or propped it in front of him for a round of making music. Now that he is almost 9 months, we keep it flat on the floor in his play area. He crawls over and sits on it, hits his favorite keys and laughs himself silly. He loves the alphabet learning mode (the letter is said, then a corresponding animal's name, then the animal's noise, then a brief song). maybe he loves it because his mom makes a great ape noise, or maybe it's the catchy ""knnick knack paddywack"". At any rate, it's still a beloved toy, and in all this time I have YET to change the batteries, even after leaving it on for days!"
5,My baby loved it!,"Our baby loved this toy, especially since she loved to kick her little legs straight out. She never got tired of the sounds it made. Her first sound that she made was the bear's growl, which was pretty funny, once we realized where that was coming from! I just had to remember to turn it off if she was going to go to sleep."
2,boring,"My little girl didn't show much interest in kicking this at all. I think the lights scared her a little. Now that she's over a year old she's more interested in it. We recently pulled it out of the closet, so it's like a new toy. It holds her attention for a few minutes, just like all her other toys :)"
1,My children did not like this toy in the crib,"It is too hard for babies to see/reach. It is good on the floor to use with their hands after they are older but I don't think the ""kick' concept works."
5,Not just for kicks!,"My daughter is two and she's had this since birth. We are just now giving it up because it's lots of fun! I love the concept of changing it from music to animal sounds as it grows with them. The batteries have held up nicely, we've replaced them once in 2 years and it's played with every day. She never really 'kicked' much but I used it for crib toy to watch and listen to and it exceeded our expectations. The colors are vibrant and it's held up extremely well. I would prefer snaps rather than ties because I had to tie knots to ensure that it wouldn't come off and then had a hard time removing it later on. That is not something I'd consider a downfall, just personal preference. I would definitely buy it again for a gift and recommend others to as well."
2,Kick and Play,"My son has the Kick and play however, it's a bit difficult for him to see what's happening when he kicks it. All he knows is that noise is coming out from below his feet."
4,"Very, very nice for one child","do not expect this toy to be handed down!This is a lovely toy for a baby, unfortunately, it does not hold up too well in storage."
2,not a good toy,"this toy is still in my sons crib, but he does not ever play with it, it just sits there. i put it there because i thought mayber he would play with it in the mourning when he wakes up, but he doesn'tkind of a waste of money, i think i'm the only one who has even touched all the keys and played with it more than 15seconds"
2,It just didn't interest him,"As this toy looked very cute, we were excited to receive it as a gift. Unfortunately, our son does not like it. He is a very active Nine month old, who seems interested in most everything. The only time I've seen him play with it is when he used his hands. From a lying down position, I don't know if he can see it very well."
4,"fun to play with hands, too","My son (now 10 months old) kicked this for a while, but when he started crawling, he really started to use it. We don't have it tied up, instead we have it lying against a wall in the living room. Almost every day, he pulls it out and starts playing with it. He really loves it! On different days we use the different sound settings, so it's a new toy (to him) when he least expects it."
3,Too Loud!,This toy is cute and it has held up well but the music is so LOUD and very annoying. 90% of our baby's toys play music and I usually love the cute music from my son's toys but this is almost unbearable...listen to it before you buy it!
1,Very Disappointing,"I was eager to expose my son (4 months old) to this toy, especially the piano function. But with it attached to the crib wall, he showed very little interest in the toy; from the lying-down position, he can't see the toy at all and it therefore did not hold his attention. The Kick & Play gym was much more successful for us. Now that he's older (8 months), I have been trying the piano on the floor for tummy time, and he similarly shows no interest. I would not recommend this toy."
2,Don't bother....,I got this for my 6 month old son for christmas and he does not like it... never plays with it. Don't waste your money on this one...
5,Great info here!,I love this book. It really shows how wild and varied humans are in their sexual needs and desires. Cool!
5,"This book will satisfy, and is still relevant today!","I once had a copy of this book twenty or so years ago. If you and your partner find that your sex life has become ""dull"" and is in need of a ""pick-me-up"" you will get something out of this book. I've always been enamored of the fact that lightly scratching on the skin of your partner is a great form of foreplay. Scratching on various parts of the your partner, I've found has led to a heightened level of arousal - both for me and the other individual. This book is almost guaranteed to restore the lust and act of sex between you and your partner!"
5,awesome,"It's a great resource for couples, and has a lot of different fun things to try in an intimate setting. Check it out, it will leave you and your partner smiling."
2,Historical and a little misleading,"I guess I didn't pay enough attention, and went with this book based way too much on the title. ""Complete illustrated"" made me think it was supposed to be the kama sutra, complete with pictures. What this book really was about, was pretty much summarizing the philosophies of the kama sutra, and not with the accompanying illustrations that you would expect. Oh, well."
3,came in useful,it was a very very small book and not what i expected but it still came in very useful these past few days
2,NO POSITIONS INCLUDED,"So, I bought this book thinking it had positions included but it doesnt. It is about mostly the spiritual aspect and whats expected of sex and the people involved. So if you're looking for the kinky book with positions, this is not it."
1,Zero if it had the option,This guide provides nothing more than the history instead of a guide on Karma Sutra. Wish I could sue the author for such lies!
2,no illustrations,"I was very disappointed when I received this book that it had no illustrations, even though the write up about it and the reviews all mention beautiful illustrations. After searching hard, I discovered that the illustrations are only in the hardcover, not the paperback, but when you order it's almost impossible to know that in advance. I think the order page should be explicit that the paperback copy has no illustrations. Beyond that, the information was not helpful or interesting. It was good for some laughs, but that's about all."
3,Good historical info,"This book is good for historical and artistic content. However, if you are looking for something more modern that will show you actual poses, don't get this book."
5,One for the ages!,The Kama Sutra is one of those books that has been around for generations and will continue to be around for generations to come!
3,It Is Just Okay,"Although very informative on the subject matter, it is not exactly what I was looking for. If you are in to this type of activity, this book gives an excellent background and understanding of Kama Sutra.The Complete Illustrated Kama Sutra"
1,Boring,I ordered this for research purposes/ history/art. Text/explanation is very text book so a bit dry and there is not one painting/photo in the entire book.
2,"There's A Reason This Book Is So ""Cheap!""","I truly don't know what I was thinking when I ordered this book. I questioned my sanity further when I received it in the mail. I was expecting illustrations, but I guess you get what you pay for.This sells for $3.50 new! This should have told me something. Spend a few more dollars buy the ""Idiot's Guide...,"" with pictures and interesting tidbits regarding the history of Kama Sutra."
2,Nothing exciting here.,"There are 3 remixes or Sour Times on this CD. 2 of them (tracks 2 and 6) are barely different from the original but aren't as good. Although they aren't _bad_ they just aren't very interesting. ""Lot More"" is the 3rd remix, and it is practically rap, its nothing like the Portishead we are used to. (I can't stand that track).""Tribute..."" Is really pretty good, its a 7 minute long jazz/blues piece (no singing) followed by a few second of silence followed by a 4 minute blues-y remix of another song from Dummy. This is easily the best track on the single.""Theme..."" looked very promising since its from a movie... except they never sing on this track either. Its allright, its better than the Sour Times remixes, and I think it would make good theme music for a movie, but nothing much new happens in the piece, its a little dull. Not something you are going to listen to over and over."
5,Great pan,"I purchased this pan nearly a year ago. I use it not only for your standard 9x13 bake jobs, but also for roasting chicken and baked pastas (such as lasagna). Everything cooks evenly and there has been no discoloration what so ever. The nonstick makes cleanup a breeze and I've had no problems putting it in the dishwasher. Sure wish Gourmet Standard was still in business..."
5,TERRIFIC MUSIC/TERRIFIC PRICE,"MY WIFE AND I ARE MUSICIANS AND HAVE PLAYED ALL KINDS OF MUSIC OVER THE YEARS. WE RAN ACROSS THIS CD RECENTLY, LIKED IT SO MUCH THAT WE ORDERED TEN COPIES TO DISTRIBUTE TO FRIENDS.WE DON'T KNOW WHO THE ARTISTS ARE ON THE ALBUM BUT NO DOUBT THEY ARE THE BEST IN THE BUSINESS!!!!YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS ONE FOR SURE!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK,"On Martha Stewart's show Feldman Gross talks about how she shows you how she to disect flower in some Japanese way to be able to press them better. She promises many tips on how to press flowers. In fact there isn't tip one in this book. So if you want an expensive book to lie on your coffe table, you might want this. But that's all it is good for. NO TIPS on pressing flowers in this rip off.Book Trader Cafe that I bought it through is a good place. The book it's self was in great shape. It's Gross that mislead what it was about."
5,The IDEAL GIFT,"This transcends the definition of a book. It is a visual masterpiece by the author/designer and you should give it as a gift to yourself or someone special---truly the IDEAL GIFT---with an affordable price for such a high quality ART book. You will see flowers like never before in thisevocative presentation of nature as art. The Afterlife of Flowers is not only for flower lovers. It will open your mind to colors, textures, journal writing, the art of seeing AND the essence of life. A MUST buy!"
5,Flowers 101,"This book provides a terrific way for everyone to appreciate the beauty of flowers! Readers like myself, who have little or no background in gardening etc, will delight in the unique images and the accompanying thoughts. It's the perfect way to share your love of flowers with a friend."
5,Amazing and Valuable. High praises.,"This dvd is well worth the price. It is thoughtfully made & well made.I just finished viewing mine for the first time and I am so inspired and honored to have this I know I will work on much of this for years to come.What a humble and skliied teacher on this disc. For any serious kung fu/ tai chi student this is recommended. As this style/ form is rare this disc is a chance to learn from a direct lineage instructor. This disc is not a beginners disc and any one looking to buy this should have or plan to have some background training in martial arts, preferably chinese.This form is both internal and external and is beautiful to watch."
2,ok movie but what nuts sell this so expensive.not even worth 5 bucks,"Ok movie probably were they got the idea for Rambo,,Linda Blair looked cute in this and Dirk Benedict did a decent job as the the veteran who gets bullied ok action and performances but definatly not worth the asking price........"
2,For Fans of the A-Team,"Four years before he did the A-Team, Dirk Benedict plays a Vietnam Vet, who comes to a small town and does battle with some townspeople who look like they are rejects from the NRA. It's very bloodless, but a lot of explosions, and shooting does take place. Amazingly no one really dies. Sound Familar. Somewhat watchable, but that's all."
1,Not even close,"I'd never heard of this movie, but given a couple of positive reviews and the fact Richard Farnsworth and Ben Johnson were in it, I bought into it.The music is entertaining at times and I admit I did laugh a couple of times, but the absurd plot was too much to digest.If you haven't seen this movie, you haven't missed a thing.Spend your money on something good, like Richard Farnswoth in the VHS Grey Fox."
5,Great reading,"This audio recording was very true to the book-great reading timbre and accents. I liked how the narrator changed the address from ""dear reader"" to ""dear listener""."
4,Into the Light,"Brave Desperaux is born with eyes open and ears large. In a case of perfidy, Desperaux, in love with Princess Pea, is given a red thread and sentenced to death for his difference. Yet, Desperaux, who dreams of happily ever after, is saved by Gregory, a rat. Finding friendship in the dungeon, Desperaux still hopes for light. Enter Miggery Sow, who dreams of being a princess. Mig's hope and love grows with this dream. With Roscuro the rat leading the way, Mig and Desperaux leave the darkness of the dungeon and go into the light."
5,Full of Adventure!,"This book was extraordinary! I loved how the chapters were short and how there were books inside the main book. The fact that the little mouse looked so different and that he liked to read was a great character to follow. It shows that he went through struggles in his life and how he overcame them, I believe that the reader appreciates hearing the bad with the good in this story. This book is full of emotion, adventure and excitement; I enjoyed reading every page! I liked how the book was written to where the audience was entangled and how the author brought the book to life by putting the reader in the story. Another neat quality of the book is the pictures in it, it could give the reader time to sit back and reflect about what they just read or even guess about what is going to happen next. This is a great story to read in the classroom, children of all ages and genders would enjoy this adventurous book!"
4,"Good story, but darker than I thought","This was a very entertaining story about a mouse and his love for a Princess. It was adventurous and had all of the elements of a classic fairy tale, yet it was must darker than I expected it to be. The descriptions of the rats and the dungeons, and the mother mouse's distain for her littlest child left me with a pit in my stomach. I would not recommend this book for children under the age of 8, but those who can handle pictures of creepy scary rats will find a fun and enjoyable story!"
