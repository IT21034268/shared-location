4,"Still getting used to it, Now he loves it.","My cat has been pretty apprehensive about using it. He still has his old one so I think that has something to do with it. I do see him using it from time to time and I think he really likes it since it is tall and he can stretch (unlike the other one which is short), it's just something new so he is still not too sure about it. It is very sturdy and a good quality product, it's just hard to get past the price tag when you aren't sure how your cat will react. I would still recommend it to anyone who has kitties that like to climb and stretch on their scratch posts since it won't wobble and has a large post for them to grab onto.Update: Now that he has had a chance to get used to the post he LOVES it. He loves stretching up and scratching and now uses it to climb up to his little house that I mounted on top of it and anchored to the wall. I am so glad that I got this for him!"
5,Best Scratching Post for my furbaby thus far!,"I was delighted to see my furbaby take to the post immediately. I was concerned he wouldn't because I've tried him on the sisal type posts that are ""refillable"", but he never took to it. He was used to scratching ""carpet"" style posts. I'm sure most cat owners who had given their cats the ""carpet"" style posts usually will see shreds of carpet left over on the floor. However, I've had this SmartCat Ultimate post for a month and the only thing on the floor are the very few nail shealths the claws leave behind, which is a good thing! He goes to it much more than his old post. I also like the sturdy built of the post which allows him to stretch vertically and gave him more surface area to scratch. We didn't add the base because we were able to place the post in a corner for support. He likes it just fine because it's in his area of our home. This would be my recommendation for the best cat post. I'm very happy with this product. Thank you!"
4,Good Product - Hard Sell for my Cat,"This is a good product, but it may not be suited for my situation. My house cat does not claw furniture, he claws the carpeting. So I haven't been able to get him interested in the post, except for rubbing his face on. Catnip is out of the question because it makes him whacked out like he's on bad drugs. I am still working with him: rubbing his paws on it, showing him the scratch gesture on it with my hands, and centering petting and brushing activity right next to the post. I even laid the post on its side for a while so it was closer to the carpet which he is used to clawing. I'm hoping for a breakthrough. My sister recommended this post to me because her 2 cats use it regularly."
3,A decent Scratch,"Bought this on Deals week. At the price i couldn't resist as my cat needed a new scratching post. Pictures made it look high quality...and i suppose its better than those a big box stores.Pros are the height, deal price, and i like the woven fabric better than sisal rope wrapped.Cons are the hard base - get something to protect your floors. The base is also smooth as opposed to carpeted like past scratchers...seems the cat prefers the old scratcher - which i've yet to dispose of.At the price i am OK with it. i wouldn't buy it again at the normal price though. I just thought this was going to be the ULTIMATE post...and its just slightly better than the old."
1,Lots of hype...!,"I was shocked to find a post that could be 4.5-5 stars on Amazon after hundreds of reviews. I bought one for my new cat thinking it would be a sure thing. My cat could not be less interested. I dangle his toys in front of it (per user suggestions) and he has on multiple occasions sunk his claws in - and had no interest. Even spreading catnip on it has had no effect. The only thing he seems to like clawing is my carpeting! Very unfortunate.Additionally, it should be known that this post is meant for hard surfaces only. On carpeting it tips VERY easily. I have a few spots in my apartment with hard floor thankfully, but that also limits where I can put it."
3,"Good, but not as good as it used to be","I bought one of these years ago, and it was wonderful. SO well made, my cat loved it, it lasted a long time and was worth every penny. So after 4 years of having cheaper/shorter posts, I ordered another one of these. This time, I could tell the quality was nothing like before. The base comes in two pieces whereas the first one was one solid piece. It is not as heavy as the original, and the construction is lower quality. Still, my cat loves it and uses it all of the time. I just don't think this one will last as long as the last one. With the economy as it is, ALL companies are lowering quality in an effort to avoid raising prices, and this must be what happened here."
4,Easy to put together,Got this so my cats would stop scratching door frames and it helps a lot but doesn't fStop them completely. I put catnip on it so my cats would use it because they didn't know what it was used for at first. But when they scratched it to get the catnip the lightbulb went off in their little kitty brains and they use it all the time.
3,Cats are ambivalent,"My cats won't touch this thing. I've rubbed it with catnip (which they are sensitive to). I've rewarded them every time they've gone near it, but it's to no avail I've demonstrated scratching on it by myself and still nothing. On the plus side: the construction is solid. The post is large, stable, and the sisal rope is good. Their resistance is a mystery to me, but they prefer the broke down scratching post that this was supposed to replace. I"
3,"Good, but not great","I bought this cat scratching post for my cat for Christmas. She had completely annihilated her last one. She absolutely loved scratching it. So I thought that a more heavy duty one would be best for her. Just like a lot of other reviewers, she did not take to this post right away. I read in another review to put a dangling toy on top of it to entice her. Unfortunately that didn't work. Eventually ( almost 2 months later) she started scratching it. Not nearly as much as her last one though. I'm hoping that she'll become more accustomed to it and scratch more and avoid scratching the carpet. On the plus side, this post is very easy to assemble and tall if you have a big cat."
2,My cats ignore this.,"Man, I'm really bummed. I wanted this to work! I have 3 cats who all love to scratch and not one of them will even look at this thing. They won't even go up to sniff it. I bought it to replace the sisal wrapped post on their cat tree that is falling apart from overuse, so I know they like vertical scratching on sisal. While I was setting this post up, they showed no interest, and played with the box it came in instead (just like a kid, right?). I really didn't think they would hesitate to scratch on this one, but they actually walk AROUND it to scratch on the couch instead. I've tried enticing them to use it with feather toys, etc., but they won't touch it.Having said that, it is a quality post. The base is wide enough to make it sturdy, and it's a nice height. It would totally be worth the price if the cats would just USE IT. I'll probably end up donating it to a cat rescue group."
3,"Good looking, but cat is not impressed",I admit that I purchased this so I would have something that looked more like furniture than a cat scratching post. It definitely fulfills that requirement and it is very well made. My cat is not a big fan of the scratching material. She tore up the previous inexpensive carpet post but doesn't spend a lot of time with this one.
4,Good post,This post is extremely well built. It is very stable and appears to be quite durable. One of my cats loves it unfortunately the other two don't care for it. I suspect it has something to do with them preferring softer textures.
5,For Cat Owners,"I love this item. My kitten loves climbing it. My 2 older cats were not used to it till I sprayed CatNip on it. Now they can run and stretch their claws on it ..saves my couch :)Well worth the money..Only bad side for me, it is made in China"
1,Seemed a great idea but did NOT receive the proper parts to put it together,"From Size - sisal - seemed great! However, the product arrived with the wrong screws, I had to go to the hardware store to purchase something similar but they did not have ""flat head"" screws which you have to have so the Post will sit level on the floor. So it now ""rocks"" until I can find the right screws to put this together.I contacted Amazon's superb customer service who offered assistance on the matter. Just be warned that you may encounter the same problem with this manufacturers' packaging since I have seen others who posted reviews with a similar problem."
5,Awesome scratching post.,"I am really impressed with this scratching post. It's much taller than most average scratching posts, so my cats can really stretch up high. It's very sturdy, and easy to put together. Great price for such a substantial scratching post. My cats love it!"
5,The re-direct project has been successful thanks to this amazing post,"Our couch was new when we bought it, but our two kitties had decided it was the designated scratch post. Before new furniture could be purchased, a re-direct project was in the works, enter the SmartCat Ultimate Scratching Post. I had never given must thought the the height of a post before, until I noticed, the kitties were tearing the couch apart a good 24 inches from the base of the couch, light bulb... they like to stretch, that scratching, is just extra goodness. Ordered the post, set up was a breeze. It is sturdy, we put a dumbbell on one side as the big boy, he's a good 25 pounds, loves to get after it, and the little one she pulls herself all the way up to the top, they love this thing. Very happy with the purchase and would recommend it highly, and boy do I love that new couch!"
5,great post for the cat and great to look at for me,"the post is stable - Stella can climb up using all four legs, she can stretch and scratch full body length - on top of it I like the look - we added the seat on our on top which even gives more option - great craftsmanship"
2,cat won't go near the SmartCat Ultimate Scratching Post,"I've had this post for a month and my cat still won't go near it. I have tried catnip, coaxing with toys and feathers, laying it on it's side and using more catnip, nothing works. I have tried a different location, scratched it myself to tempt him, everything that was recommended. I wish I had sent it back."
2,Disappointed,"Neither of my cats have shown the slightest inclination to use it. I've placed it in the area they like to scratch in the morning and they just ignore it. I really wish the description specified that it was sisal, I thought it was carpet, which is why I ordered it."
2,Great idea!,I thought by buying this item it would turn my cat away from scratching the walls but she will not even touch it!! I think this item is great but unfortunetly its not for me or my cat.
5,"""Killer to Post""","All cats have a ""killer instinct"" in them, and they need to exorcise it.... They feel good after having attacked the Cat Scratch Post...I have two Ragdoll cats... They now... literally pounce on the poor post, but it is more than up to the task...So... the post is good for the cat's claws....and his psyche..."
4,First impressions are everything.,"I just received the scratching post today and the base (which is in two pieces) has to be assembled together with the pre-drilled holes to make one solid base[easy enough]. The factory drilled the holes with out measuring or something because the two pieces have a gap between them when installed,which doesn't look good. I had to drill some new holes which wasn't too hard but it's just something I shouldn't have had to do. First impressions are everything so I'm a little upset with it right now. I'm positive that in the future I'll be glad I purchased it because for a cat scratching post it doesn't look half bad. I'm just a little ticked off I had to fix something that is so easy to make right the first time. 1 star deducted for that. Other than that, It looks great and looks like it will last for some time."
5,A Scratching Post My Cat Likes Better Than My Couch!,"I no longer have to work anywhere near as hard to keep my cat from scratching my couch! She loves how much taller and sturdier this post is than her old one. It was easy to assemble, doesn't look too out of place in my living room, and my cat uses it almost exclusively instead of the couch."
1,What a disappointment!,It is very cheap looking and made in China. I didn't like it and will not subject my cats to it. I noticed it had a strong chemical odor and the so called sisal felt like it had a glue in it. Am not sure what it is made of so to be on the safe side it is going back.
1,"Great construction, but my cats have zero interest","Very well constructed and sturdy enough for a big Maine Coon, but my two cats care less about using this post, despite lots of tempting catnip. They prefer the less expensive posts covered in carpet. A solid product if your cats will use it. But for me, a $70 bust."
5,Best scratching post for large/tall kitties!,"This is the best scratching post (and the best price for this item). It is tall, which is a necessity when you have a large breed cat, such as a Ragdoll. My kitties love this -- may purchase another."
2,My cat just didn't like it. At all.,"Moderately stable (too tippy for my skiddish cat, though the brave one probably wouldn't have minded if he'd had the least bit of interest in it); Don't bother with the topper and seat cushion... it's like an oven mit and slides around. The sissel seems like a great fabric without being too harsh for delicate pads... but as it turns out, my cats won't scratch anything but cardboard or carpet. Who knows? I ended up selling this on craigslist. Good luck!"
2,Our Cats Do Not Like This Product,"We purchased this item on a lightening deal before Christmas and paid about $40. I'm glad we didn't pay any more than that. Our cats have several scratching posts around the house and the bases are all covered with carpet. On this new ""Smart Cat"" Scratching Post, the base is hard plastic, slick and slippery. The cats can't get a foot hold with their back paws or claws when they stand up on it to scratch. They have tried standing off of the slick base to scratch the post with their front claws, but it's awkward for them. They've also tried laying on top of the base to scratch the post with their front paws, but they slide around on the hard plastic surface. As a result, they now just ignore this item. We are going to try and cover the base with carpet ourselves. If this doesn't work, we may end up donating it to a local shelter."
5,"Cat in love with it, I in love for different reasons","My cat is in love with this thing. It's stable, attractive, and perfect for climbing. Plus for the cat owners, it doesn't easily shred, meaning no cleanup of small fibers like with my previous posts.A tad bit expensive, but not going to be soon replaced."
3,SMARTCAT ULTIMATE SCRATCHING POST,"Well...the scratching post is deluxe! It assembles easily. It is sturdy looking. I do not think it would tip...however...even with catnip as an enticement, my cat won't go near the post! It looks good, but thus far it has not been used. Maybe my cat is not so smart, or maybe you can't teach an old ""cat"" new tricks!"
5,love it!,"My cats love this scratching post because they can scratch it, climb it and play on it. It's also the best looking scratching post I've seen so it's not an eye sore in the home. It doesn't really even look like a scratching post. It's also very heavy which is nice because it doesn't tip over. On Amazon it's half the cost as anywhere else."
2,Ultimate Scratch Post,After receiving the post and putting it together I thought for the price it would have been a pretty sturdy product. The base is very loose and the post itself is wobbly. My cats haven't gone near it. I put cat nip on it and have tried coaxing them to the post but to no avail?
3,Not all sisal is created equal.,"My cat loved sisal scratching posts - but only a particular kind of sisal: the thick, ""ropey"" kind. She went to town on these posts, and I had to replace the rope frequently. The SmartCat Ultimate had great reviews, and I wanted to try it to see if this would hold up better. Well, I'll never know, because she refused to touch it. She went nuts for catnip spray, but even spraying that on the post wouldn't entice her. I think something about this kind of sisal just did not appeal to her. I can say that it looked well-made and sturdy, and I really appreciated the simple design.All's well that ends well, because I ended up donating the unused post to my Humane Society. Hopefully some cats there appreciated it more than my picky girl did!"
3,Unstable,My tall cat almost pulled this over on him when he tried to scratch on it...scared him to death and he won't use it at all now!!! Even though I wedged it under the sofa so that it would not turn over. The base needs to be larger on it!
3,just ok,"Looks nice but cats not too crazy about it, even tried catnip on it. Purchased a few months ago and still working on getting them to use this instead of my carpet. Think I may just recover with carpet and be done with it. The base and top are a pretty wood color, and as far as scratching posts go it is one of the nicest I have seen..just have to convince my cats of that!"
3,Rejected by Kitty,"I wanted this scratching post to work. The material is supposed to be the best out there for most cats. I liked the height of this unit, though the base's construction leaves a bit to be desired (although it shouldn't be falling over on your cat). Despite efforts ranging from catnip to toys and even scratching it ourselves in an effort to inspire interest, it just didn't happen. Our second cat, who happens to have no front claws, does love it, though.Although this is a no-go for me, I'm still going to give it some stars for being what seems to be an excellent product."
5,Wish I had invested in this earlier!,"Since I purchased this scratching post...my cat has totally given up scratching in all of her favorite places..namely all of my furniture and she has also given up shredding the carpet in the doorways. I would have saved the expense of getting a new carpet, thanks to her, if I had invested earlier. It is well worth every penny and I am sure she would agree as she hits it up every time she walks past it as it gives her a good stretch and keeps her nails just how she likes em. There's something about the sisal that she loves..other than the catnip."
1,Dont get your hopes up,"I'm sure its great if your cats like it, but a big gamble for an expensive wooden pole that sits untouched in my dining room. I've tried all the suggested ways to get my 3 cats to love this post and all have failed. Even their favorite toys dancing all around it does nothing. I had high hopes and now I'm just $50 poorer."
4,met expectations,"took a while for cats to use it,,, but now they use it on a regular basis works well for large cats like mine"
3,Sloppy finishing,This scratching post serves my needs and my big indoor (unwilling -serving time for five years ) ginger cat. Post is sturdy and gives a good stretch to a big cat. It is heavy and stable. I am annoyed by poor finishing of the vertical post whereby the vertical does not quite fit into the horizontal floor piece. This looks sloppy but does not impair stability - for the price they should do better. Be sure you want this item - very heavy and difficult to take apart and return.
3,My cat loves it,Great for adult cat. However the screws that were sent are not long enought to secrue the base to the scratching post. If I did not have a large screw and an electric screwdriver it may not have worked.
5,just what we needed,"I had purchased a smaller inexpensive cat scratching post and our cat would topple it over when she used it. Of course that scared her and she substituted the carpet on the stairs and chairs. This post is perfect. Easy to assemble, nice and tall for a full scratch and has not ever falled over. It's well built and arrived quickly. I would highly recommend this post."
5,What A Lifesaver,"I have an older cat who doesn't go outside as much as she used to. As a result her claws were very long. They would get caught in everything, including me.After using this for about a month, her claws are greatly reduced, less sharp?She loves it. She can't walk past it without scratching on it. She started using it from day one.It was simple to put together. It is very well made and well worth the asking price."
5,Perfect for a big cat,"I looked high and low for a post that a big cat ( 20lbs) could use - he was using the wood work because the old post kept falling over. This one is tall enough and sturdy enough he can stretch to full size, and for my small cat - she can climb it like a tree. Long lasting and durable."
2,Our Cats Don't Like It,"I liked the idea of getting a tall scratching post. And this one is well-constructed. But even after spraying it with catnip spray, rubbing real catnip into the upper part of it, and scratching at it myself with the cats watching, they've shown little to no interest in it. They prefer the carpet-covered variety and/or our upholstered chairs. I'm considering returning the product (if I can), but instead I may recover the post with carpet and see what happens."
5,I love it... and so do my cats,My two cats immediatly loved the scratching post. They can stretch to their height in order to file their paws and they enjoy it very much. I think its dimensions are perfect for them.
5,Cat Scratch Fever!,Very impressed with the quality. So far so good with our 2 cats. All it takes is a bit of encouragement (scratch it yourself) and they know what to do. The older declawed cat enjoys it probably better than the younger still intact cat does. That doesn't help our furniture any but I thought it was worth noting. I would definitely recommend.
5,Awesome,"I've been looking for a tall sisal scratching post for a couple of weeks. When I found this, it is one of the best purchases I've made. The post is reallly sturdy and well made. The price is reasonable too."
5,Great Scratching Post,"I own two of these, and the cats just love them. If you really want to keep scratching down, then you need a few of these spread around the house."
2,"Easy to put together, but.....","This product was very easy to put together. There were only 2 screws and 2 dowels to put this product together. After putting the product together, I found that it does not tip over very easily, which is a huge plus for owners with curious cats!I set it for my two cats to use, who are declawed. I have had it setup for less than a week now and the fabric is already starting to pull away from the product. You can tell that the fabric is already pulling away from the board in the middle. It seems that this product was not made properly. I am going to try and return it.I would give it a 4 star for set up and packaging and a 1 star to quality of product. I would avoid this. It is not worth the money."
3,My cat wouldn't use it,"After encouraging her and hanging toys above/on it, she tried it once, but she never wanted to use it again. Maybe, it's too rough feeling, or she had a hard time getting her claws out of it. It's too bad because it looks a lot nicer than the ones she likes to use (carpet scratchers)."
3,Cant scratch this!,"I saw this and figured what a perfect scratching post for my 2 cats. Boy was I wrong. I have had it for several weeks now, and I dont even think they have touched it once!!Even catnip sprinkled on it doesnt attract them. I dont know why. Its nice and tall and sturdy! I really like it, but I guess I am not the one that matters. I still have hope!! If they get to where they actually start using it, I will come back and let everyone know how well or not it works. Until then......to be continued."
4,Great although...,"Love the scratching post but had a heck of a time setting it up because the screw that came with it weren't even long enough to reach inside of the post. After we found screws that would work, set it up and the kittens come out and scratch on it everyday and love to climb up it. Would like to get another but would have to get different screws again."
3,"It's nice looking, but not sturdy","My cats haven't been really into this. I think part of the problem is that it threatens to topple over whenever they climb on it. I got the little seat that attaches to the top, and that helps, but overall it just sits in the corner and they don't really mess with it. It's an expensive toy that simply gets no use. I think it could be a lot sturdier - I don't blame them for not climbing on it, I'd be afraid of it falling, too."
3,Quantity has a quality all its own.,"I am definitely a Beach Boys fan, and I own the Pet Sounds Sessions box set, and I don't think anyone has to be a music critic to notice that something went wrong between Pet Sounds and these albums. In fact, the Beach Boys sound like almost a totally different band. It's like having two albums worth of experimentation by Beach Boys band members on one CD.I'm giving this CD three stars mainly because you get two albums on one CD, and that's a lot of reasonalby listenable music for the money. And, I must say that this disc has grown on me over several listenings. It has a charm of it's own, but anyone buying this after buying the early-to-mid 60's Beach Boys recordings (the ones that made them a legend) might be in for quite a jolt."
3,The Beginning of The Fall From Grace,"Folks' can we be honest here? The Beach Boys quality of music in the 70's cannot measure up to their 60's output; Billboard chart action verifies this. I myself bought all the 70's LPs when released on CD in the early 90's. I am not a casual listener, rather a huge BB fan. To indicate that these releases are well expected due to the out of print status of the Caribou/Brother CDs is of course, true. But to indicate that they are full of quality songs is not true. With fewexceptions, the quality material is on the recently released Vol. 3 of the Brothers years greatest hits. Basically what we are getting is a lot of ordinary songs that now sound better."
3,one of the biggest charades in rock,"It's simply amazing how many fans and critics gush over this album. Their fascination with the Beach Boys and their attempt to justify the Beach Boys' place in music history has clouded their judgement. This is a sub-par album, and I only gave it the 3 star review because of historical significance.If you are looking to complete your Beach Boys collection, make sure you have Pet Sounds and Greatest Hits 1. Those are essential to any rock collection. Sunflower/Surf's Up is highly inessential and is a boring, dull, lifeless listen from start to finish.The only good songs, Till I Die, Surf's Up, and Disney Girls are relatively mediocre songs compared to the rock pantheon. The low points (Student Demonstration Time, A Day In The Life Of A Tree, Take A Load Off...) are absolutely embarrassing."
4,Great post Pet Sounds work from the boys!,"I have waited for a long time for this album to be rereleased, since it has been out of print. This album, as with all post pet sounds beach boy albums, contains introspective lyrics and lush orchestrial backrounds. Although the album suffers from a few attempts from Mike Love to be a relevant political songwriter, his lyrics falter (stick to surf boards and girls, mike), overall a highly entertaining and beautiful album that will have a welcome place in any fan's lacking collection."
4,Beach Boys,"I'm giving the 4 stars to the second album on this twin cd, Surf's Up. Next to Pet Sounds, Surf's Up is my favorite Beach Boys album. Personal favorites from Surf's Up are ""Don't go near the Water"" and especially ""'Til I Die"" which I could play ad infinitum because there's so much there, with the echo chamber and vocal harmonies and all. --Alex Sydorenko, Chicago, 2001."
5,A Testament to their enduring appeal,"2 albums with a beautiful sound to them. Although Brian Wilson had less influence in the writing of these songs, they are still some of the very best Beach Boys albums. A must have Twofer"
4,Surf's Up!,I like this one over Pet Sounds big time... the Boys were definitely in their groove for this one... I have a bootleg copy of Wild Honey with outtakes of the Boys smoking hash... it's a riot!
2,Ho Hum,This book offers nothing I hadn't heard before and also some factual inaccuracies. I just view it as a puff piece that offers nothing concrete and adds nothing to the understanding of the lives of these 3rd generation Kennedy's.
3,Good for new Kennedy fans only,"If you don't know much about the members of the 3rd Generation, then this book is good for you to buy. If you have been following the family for a while, you won't find much new."
1,No new information and poorly compiled,"This is an introduction into the Kennedy family, but beyond that the book is not very helpful. The author Jay David Andrews drew most of his material from other popular books (such as All Too Human by Edward Klein) and articles about the Kennedy family. Andrews does not divulge deeply into the Kennedy family, the myths, truths, or provide any new insight or information to make this book worth reading. As another reviewer stated, this book has a tabloid quality about it that detracts from the quality of the book. A reader will learn more about the Kennedy's by reading other news magazine reports and other books about the subject."
5,Excellent for the Digital Photographer,I love this little mini drive. I paid much more for mine then this. I took it to Niagara Falls with me and took hundreds of pictures and never filled it up. I love that it handles almost all types of media.
4,It does the job well and works,Looked at many. This one is easy to work with and makes good coffee. Will probably get the 12 cup as well.
3,Don't think twice: Get the newer (second) edition instead!,"Just do as I did (thanks to my public library). Spend about five minutes scrutinizing the noteworthy differences between any particular section of this first (2004) edition and the analogous section of the second (2008) edition (Oxford American Writer's Thesaurus). You'll surely conclude that the significantly improved layout (plus certain newly introduced features) of the ""updated"" edition make this prior edition significantly less ""user-friendly."" [This inescapable fact ultimately compelled me to spend (admittedly grudgingly) about 2.5 times as much money for a Like New copy of the ""new"" edition as I would've had to spend for a Like New copy of this prior, ""outmoded"" edition.]"
1,An awkward combination of thesaurus and essays,"If you want a thesaurus, I recommend ""The Synonym Finder"" (if you want an alphabetical thesaurus) and ""Bartlett's Roget's Thesaurus"" (if you want a traditional thesaurus arranged by subject).If you want a book that explains the differences between synonyms, I recommended the Merriam-Webster ""Dictionary of Synonyms"" or ""Choose the Right Word.""However, in the unlikely event that you want a thesaurus interspersed with essays by supposed writing experts, you might enjoy this book. I'd like to point out, though, that all thesauruses are for writers, and calling this a ""writer's thesaurus"" doesn't make it any more so.All in all, this is an average thesaurus, but the essays are a distraction and their tone is too personal and opinionated for a reference work. Because of this, I don't think this book will stand the test of time."
2,there is a gaping hole in this book...,"I checked Hypatia's Daughters out of the library some time ago. Philosophy is a semi-hobby of mine and I thought it was great that there was a survey of women in philosophy. This is until I went through the table of contents and index and found that Ayn Rand isn't even mentioned, not once. I'm not an objectivist by any stretch of the imagination, but Ayn Rand is the single most influential female philosopher of at least the last few hundred years. Love or or hate her, she is definitely more influential than Angela Davis, who gets a chapter of her own. I don't know what other female philosophers have been edited out of existence, but this book is not what it claims to be."
1,Awful,"I cannot think of anything to recommend this book. Even a book with bad recipes can be enjoyable if it has decent pictures, but this doesn't even have that. The recipes are, at best, only vaguely Chinese and not that interesting at all. Some of the few pictures provided are actually off-putting. This cheap publication is a cobbled-together rip-off, in my opinion. Save your money."
2,"I liked the big ""Talk"" button but item broke fast","I needed to buy a home phone for elderly people, so I was looking for bit ""Talk"" button, which this product had. Sound quality was Ok, but phone stopped working within several months of usage."
1,GE Cordless Phones,"I hated this set, must have been one of the first ones ever. If the electric went off, had to take second phone to first phone base to re-activate. Set only lasted a year or a little longer, then we threw them out. Would never buy another GE phone, maybe not another GE product...."
2,Short life,"GE Cordless 2.4 GHz 27831GE2 Phone with Dual Handsets and Call Waiting Caller ID - WhiteI bought these in the middle of May, by the end of September one was completely dead - no it's not the battery. Yes, they were cheap so I suppose I got what I paid for! Foolish savings - now I'll pay more for a better set and still be out the money for these."
2,Not worth the money,"Way to difficult to use! No one could figure out how to use all the neat little features and programs, I wasn't impressed."
5,wonderfully resourceful,i love this book because it has such a variety of animals in it- not just the same old ones that are in all animal books. tons of actual pictures instead of drawings. i've learned quite a bit from it as has my two-year-old. each page has a small narration by pooh and his friends.
1,needs fact checking,"While it sounds obvious, children's nonfiction books should be fact-checked, and this one obviously wasn't. The four photos of ""whales"" are orcas, aka ""killer whales"" because they can kill whales. Orcas are dolphins, not whales. Such a blatant factual error makes all of the content suspect.I tried to contact the publisher, Innovage LLC, to make them aware of this error to correct in reprints but got nowhere. I would like Disney to know that a Disney-branded children's book contains mistakes, but finding the right person at Disney is too big of a task for me.The book is colorful with lots of appealing photos for children, but the first and most important task of a nonfiction reference book for children is to provide accurate information, and this title fails at that."
5,Our daughter loves this!,"Our daughter has both this and the Nature encycopedia, and loves them both. They're fun for any age - she's loved them since she was a little over a year of age, and her 4 year old and 6 year old cousins also pore over the books.The pictures are beautiful, the graphics and text to my knowledge are accurate. One of the things I LOVE is that the mammal section mentions how the babies ""drink their mom's milk"" to grow, which is something that kids who grow up in the city are a lot less likely to see and realize. For those who breastfeed, it's a great tie-in to that for you and your child."
5,Great for any bears fan,I bought this for my fiancee as a christmas present. I looked all over including the homepage for the Chicago Bears any couldn't find this shirt.It was exactly what he had been looking and an awesome price. Everything about the transation was 5 stars. The quality to it shippping so quickly and a week before Christmas.
3,Great looking shirt.... Poor quality,I just got my shirt and washed it inside out in cold water. As soon as I took it out to let it air dry I noticed the logo. It had already begun to peel. Take into consideration that I washed it in cold water with minimal detergent on a gentle cycle. It really ticks me off paying 20+ bucks for a tshirt only to have it peel on me before I can wear it.
3,Needs adapter to attach the blade to the arm.,"Same cheap composite material as the original--no complaints there. Approximately the same shape. My 1994 Dodge Caravan SE was a little different. The end of my original was curved like a U and fit right into any auto store blade. The new one has no U-shape at the end, but a peg/shaft-like cylinder at the end that runs parrallel to the rear window. The shaft is the same thickness as the frame of the blade and is notched in the middle. I think there's an adapter that will make it work, but I don't know how much that is yet.A new rear windshield wiper arm is about $80-100 at a dealer. I found this online for $20, so as long as the adapter is less than $50-$60 I'm golden. I'll update this when I price the adapter."
4,fantastic cd from the scottish punk rockers - highly recom.,stand out songs are 1. flex 2. thought 6. bellend host 9. home 10. voicesgreat album - a must buy for punk rock lovers and bodyboarders familiar with the video power trips!!!
5,"Realistic, Inside look at the College Football Week",If you love college football...you'll love this book. The writer spends a complete week with each of several major college football programs during the 2003 season. This gives a real insiders look at what goes on duting the whole week in preparation for the game on Saturday. I came away from this with a real respect for how much time the players and especially coaches put in.
2,Wide Right,"This book reads like a journal. It's a good comparative look at how different coaches run their programs; however, it's basically the same 15 page story chapter after chapter. Based on the author's access to the programs and coaches, he does begin to explore some interesting stories regarding assistants, family, boosters, academincs, and recruiting but gives those ideas a paragraph or two and moves on to the next thing. Had those ideas been further explored the book could have delivered what I expected; however, I felt like I was reading the fragmented journal of an author trying to keep a book to a certain length."
2,Interesting overview of the business of college football but too easy,"This book does a good job of portraying college football, and for that matter college sports for what it is, a business designed to make money for the NCAA. This book however does not question any of the aspects of the college game and does a poor job and questioning if these actions are correct? We are lead to believe that college football is a perfect solution and something we should all emulate.This book would have been much more successful if it did something other than paint each coach in the book as a legend. It seems the author was completely biased and enraptured by who he was portraying. Sadly there is nothing that makes this anything more than a plausibly interesting profile of college football."
2,Boring. Don't waste your time.,"I am a huge college football fan and couldn't wait to read this book. I expected some really interesting insight, but all I got was the same generalized rendition over and over again.The author rarely details anything besides practice schedules (how exciting!) and the quotes he uses are so lame you wonder why he included them at all. I don't think there is a simple interesting quote in the entire book. Often times the author will lead you down a path and then not deliver. The ""feel-good"" stories about each coach in the beginning of each chapter all sort of read alike and they don't relate very well to the behind-the-scenes angle that the author is trying to take.I was extremely disappointed. If you want a great book on college football read ""Rammer Jammer Yellow Hammer"" by Warren St. John. It's more about fans and culture, but it's a thousand times better (and funny)."
5,News from the author,"I just found out that ""City Smart Anchorage"" has won a bronze medal in the 16th annual Lowell Thomas Travel Journalism Competition, a national contest sponsored by the Society of American Travel Writers Foundation. Among the judges' comments: ""An especially common-sense book that is well organized, concisely written and with much useful information...Contains a lot of ""dos and don'ts"" and local terms and trivia that will help a visitor quickly feel at home."""
2,Thought It Would Last Longer,"I like others here have had the unfortunate experience of owning this product to wake up several mornings to find that the heat was no longer on and the temp was down in the 50s. What kept happening is that even if the unit was in the Heat position and appeared to be running it would not activate the furnace. Then when trying to turn the heat off and on it had constant clicking noises. I guess the relays on the board are bad. I have only owned this product for about 2 years. I originally bought it cause it served the same functions as other programmable units but was much cheaper. I never expected the thermostat to quit on me like this. If you are selling your house and want to upgrade than this is great, otherwise if you want to live in your house awhile then get something else."
1,Look Elsewhere,"I bought this thermostat a few months ago. It was easy to install, but that is about the only good thing I can say about this unit. Now that the weather has gotten cold in New York, I set the date and time, and programed the thermostat, but it constantly loses the date, time, day of the week, and once or twice a day it resets itself to the factor setting of 62 degrees. As soon as I find a good replacement, this unit is history!"
1,Ours stopped working after 8 years,"This worked fine for us for a number of years, although I've never liked the weekday/weekend programming. If you're ever home sick or for a holiday, or anything outside your normal schedule, it's a pain to tell it that you're home and yes it really should heat the house.But now that it's about eight years old, it just decided to stop turning on our furnace. The display registers the correct actual and target temperatures, but even if they are several degrees apart, the furnace will not turn on. If we remove it from the wall and replace it (as if to change the batteries), then the furnace finally kicks on. Today, even that stopped helping - I've replaced it on the wall to no avail - no heat! I'm freezing here while waiting for my new Honeywell thermostat to arrive."
1,The Lux TX500B is TERRIBLE.,"We bought two of these last year and both of them have issues. The one upstairs constantly resets itself to factory settings, loses the time/date, etc. I cannot trust that the temperature will stay where I set it. The one downstairs does it to, but not nearly as much. And I don't think they are very accurate either. I would not recommend these at all."
5,Tropical Papaya enzymes,"Great product , great taste, I would order it again and the price was great this was the first time i ordered this product and am pretty happy with it."
4,ok now we're talking,"This album has been re-released with a new cover, extra tracks and you can get it at amazon.de or i tunes. That isn't a dog on the cover, like the other reviewer wrote, but a rat. On the new cover there are a bunch of rats because the album's title Hameln or Hamlin in english which is a german town that the story of the pied piper originated from. Anyways this is an acoustic album with some singing and some of the tracks have someone talking. Some of the tracks have soundeffects like children or woman crying which seem to ruin the track that they are in. Overall this is a good cd if you like medievel folk music."
1,Norpro compost pail filters,"Interesting how a product shown as circular can have the following dimensions: 8.5 x 7.2 x 0.5 inches!Norpro could make everyone's life easier by including measurements with their filter product packaging and advertising. Amazon, and most other sites that sell compost pail filters, should also include correct measurements. Some sets of filters shown as circular on Amazon and other sites actually include one circular and one square filter."
2,mislabeled filters,"These filters are NOT for the stainless steel composters. The marketing on Amazon is done poorly and doesn't reflect the correct version of the composter. I was in contact with the seller about this issue. If you have to buy filters, buy them from Home Naturals. That company goes the extra mile for customer satisfaction and I would definately buy from Home Naturals again."
3,don't fit the stainless steal compost bin!,"Regular Filters, but there's nowhere mentioned the size and they don't fit the compost bin I bought. Many times I did not find enough information on amazon's webpage about size!"
3,charcoal filters,Hard to see size on these I have a slightly larger can than the one pictured These will do but not quite as large as I wanted
4,No stink here,I admit to not emptying my compost pail as frequently as I should. So keeping the smell contained is really important. These babies do the trick beautifully.
2,too small,"The companies that sell these filters need to note the diameter. The volume of the pail is not relevant because some pails are taller and some shorter so the diameter and a photo of the lid would sure make is easier for the consumer. I've spent too much time searching and still am not certain which filter to buy for my compost pail. So far, only one company mentioned a diameter measurement, which was the wrong size for my pail."
2,Wrong size,"The filters appear to be fine, just too small for the counter composter I bought as a gift. It seems a hassle to have to return them for exchange."
4,okay for the price,"These were super cheap and fit my compost pail really well, and they did contain the odor, but they developed mold, whereas other brands I've used have never developed mold. Now I have a science project on my counter top."
1,Too small,"I bought these because I bought the stainless steel kitchen composter and these showed up with it as items ""bought with"" that kitchen composter and they're too small!! What a rip off! Amazon, get it right!"
4,Norpro Filters,Great option for small compost keepers. keeps the smell minimal so it's better than most. the filter makes a big difference
1,Not Impressed,This producted arrived in a ziplock baggie that anyone could by at walmart. NOT a professional product at all! A small peel and stick label was on the baggie with the seller's primative info.The product is not the size it stated and does not fit the Home Naturals Compost pail as it indicates that it should.
4,Very effective for the 1 gallon Norpro comport bin,"Replacethis charcoal filter once every 3-6 months, and it effectively reduces odors in our 1 gallon Norpro Compost bin, which is used daily. With an absence of odor, the bin can be placed on the kitchen counter and easily accessed."
4,"Norpro 93F 2 Count Filter Fefills, Charcoal","The filters arrived in the time frame as expected. I haven't had a chance to use these filters yet, as the compost keeper came with one filter already inside the lid. But the fitler that came with the keeper seems to work very well in keeping odors down to a minimum."
1,Does not fit!,"This is the wrong size filter for the Natural Home Stainless Steel Compost Bin. I purchased them because they were linked via Amazon ""Frequently Bought Together"" items. The filters are 5.5"" and you need the 7.5"" filters. Very irritating that Amazon did this!"
5,filters,Worked very well for what i wanted them for i am using them for replacement vent air filters. great fast deliver exactly as describedThank you
2,Quickly but...,"I thought these would help with odor but found that they really do not. I also had a problem with little bugs around the composted. Long story short, unable to use inside the house."
3,Charcoal Filters,This product is just what it stated to be. It works just like it said that it would.
5,Wonderful,"Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. Very good story! Keeps you interested in what happens next."
3,Good coverage but minimal cushioning.,"I've been using these kneepads for playing volleyball on gym floors - basketball courts, to be specific. I find that the design of the padding makes for great coverage of the front and sides of my knee. However, the padding is only about half an inch thick, and not strong enough to prevent bruising to my knees when I dive onto the floor. The impacts to my knees are not as painful as they would be without these kneepads, but I do wind up with bruising nevertheless. I wish these pads had stronger/thicker cushioning."
1,Use a different store,"Hello,I just want to alert people to be careful where they buy this product. I bought this item, via Amazon, from Worldwide Sport Supply. I will never buy anything from them ever again. They do not respond when you contact them. They do not inform you of when you might get the product. I purchased the product on September 22nd. It is October 11th and I am still waiting for the product.I highly recommend purchasing products from Amazon Prime capable vendors.Chriso"
5,"Good Quality, Value and NO MORE RUST",This polished stainless steel trailer hitch ball does cost more than the traditional plated steel balls. After years and years of rusty trailer hitch balls you have to put grease on this is over for good. The quality of the ball is outstanding and easy to install. I still had to use another wrench to put the final torque on the ball. The yellow tab thing didn't work to stop the ball from turning. No issue as the ball is the last I will ever have to buy.
5,"It's Stainless for an AWESOME price, what is not to love?","I bought this for about $8 from Warehouse Deals, and even though it said ""Used"" it was brand new. The nut and lock washer are zinc plated, but I do not care. I just didn't want a rusted hitch ball anymore."
5,Gotta love it if you love Trace,"I hesitated buying this DVD as I was unsure because it included Travis Tritt. Well, I finally bought it and now wonder why on earth I didn't buy it sooner. I absolutely love it! Trace is in fine form and I love watching this DVD. I even like the Travis Tritt portion of the DVD despite not being a huge fan of his. I bought it to see Trace and highly recommend that you do the same."
2,Nursing students beware!!,"This book would be good if you are going into a low level medical feild where you do not go into great depths, or for kids or possibly high school students. However, I bought this for nursing school and could not even use it. It doesn't go into enough depth with bones, muscles, nerves, ect.. I was going to use this for an anatomy and physiology class not even an actual nursing class, and it was just useless. If you are buying for nursing school, I reccommend going into a book store to look around for what you want first, then come here and see if you can get it cheaper. You get what you pay for!"
2,Better off reading Jory Strong's Angellini series,"This novel read very similar to Jory Strongs's Angellini series, except it not written well. I really liked Sharon Page's Sin so this comes as a surprise for me. The storyline of vampire hunter falling for vampires has been tediouly boring and this novel falls into that category."
2,just okay,"I wasn't impressed by this book. I had read other books by Sharon Page which were much better. This one dragged and I didn't think there was much of a plot. Even the ""love scenes"" seemed forced. No pun intended. It took me almost a week to read a book that I normally would have finished in one day."
2,Not so interesting after a while!,"I am a big fan of historical romances especially ones involving vampires. But this book got tediously boring and repetetive after a few pages. There should seriously be a limit to the number of times people are allowed to have sex in a book. This story literally goes from one sexual encounter to the next. It is enjoyable only to an extent,after a while, you just want to say, 'Get over it'.It would have been a better read if the author had taken the trouble to have an actual story around these scenes. 'Sin' by the same author is a better read.I normally read these books overnight or in a day, but this one literally dragged on for days and days."
1,pretty ordinary book,"I was quite disappointed with this book. Author has just elaborated what Buffet has said in other words without any single clue about how to apply it practically. I would rather suggest warren buffet says - wits & wisdom from world's greatest investor. Atleast there we can get stuff directly from horse's mouth, rather than in differnt words from somebody who has neither meet buffet."
5,Words to invest by,"A good description of Buffett's habits, this is the kind of thing business schools should be teaching. If all investors followed Buffett's lead, the stock market would be a far more stable institution."
4,Great exhaust at a decent price.,"This is by far my favorite exhaust for the Miata. Got it for my 92. Deep and throaty and not ricey at all. Under WOT it sounds great, and idle makes it purr. Doesn't have a high pitched screaming sound. The only part I didn't like is that is very droney on the 1.6 Miata. I had to install a $70 resonator which is a common fix for these exhausts, so be aware of that."
5,The best,"I have had this Borla cat/back system on my 1991 Miata for 13 years. It is fantastic. I did a lot of research before I bought it and determined Borla was the best choice for me. I chose it for three reasons:1) It produced the best power, and was backed by numerous dyno tests;2) It's significantly lighter than stock;3) It's all stainless steel and will last forever.On that last point, my system still looks great after 13 years. It's been to the track numerous times so it's seen maximum heat. Still looks and sounds great.SOUNDI think it's just right. Yes, it's perhaps 25% louder than stock. It's a bit deeper, too, but not tinny or ""bees in a can"" sounding. The timbre changes as it heats up, which takes a good 30 minutes of use, but it's a very subtle change (gets a bit louder and more aggressive).It does not drone at 3100 rpm like other brands do, or like my race exhaust does."
3,Black Grass - Black Grass,"Black Grass' eponymous debut comes on like a ton of funk with ""Grass Roots,"" even if it edges into Rae & Christian-type hip-hop with ""Easy"" and ""Self Assessment."" ""Score"" dashes in a little Spanish flavor with the guitar (though the jazz sax, Rhodes, and double bass may contradict it some), while ""Going Home"" has a nice moody vibe to it. The album also mixes in some disco with the funk: it's all of the 70s in one convenient location (with some dub making an appearance in ""Nice Up"" too). The Afro-jazz breaks of ""Reprise"" are quite nice, as are the mellow stylings of ""Toys."" Good, if not exemplary."
2,JUNK,"Flip it over and see where it's made.Stainless seperated from cup within 2 days.Everything that I put inside mine comes out tasting like yummy chinese chemicals!Final thoughts- overpriced peice of Chinese plastic with some pretty trim. Does keep stuff hot, though."
3,Does the Job,"This definately keeps my coffee hot, which is what is really important.However, within a week the Stainless Steel cover of the cup seperated from the plastic body.The design of the plastic on the top and bottom that covers the body of the thermos leaves space where water can collect from washing. So when I pour I normally get water dripping from the base. Kind of disgusting.I would not buy another of these."
2,DISAPPOINTED!!!!,"I was disappointed! after using it three times the cover came apart, it revealed that the styrofoam inside was not completely covered. I am beginning to smell mildew."
1,Leaks after first use,"Defective. Any liquid going down the outside of the bottle quickly seeps into the base, and then dribbles out when you pour. This happened right away, before any dishwashing or anything.""The Rock."" What a joke."
2,keeps hot but soaks everything,"it keeps stuff hot forever.. but the base holds water from washing and it constantly drips out when pouring,, or soaks my work bag when i travel..probably taking it back and looking for another model with out the water trap handle/base"
4,Good but...,"Works well for a thermos. Keeps the liquids hot up to 8 hours. Warm at best at 24 hours. I'm realistic to my expectations, though. The handle is a bit daunting. I hike a lot and it would have been better if it was smaller and folded down to pack away. As noted before, the plastic top and bottoms do collect water and drips out when you pore. It bothered me more than I thought given prior reviews to this problem. Simple fix though, silicone around the top and bottom. But, wouldn't expect to be doing this for this product! Likely upgrade to the Thermos Nissan 34 or 61 oz. More packable. Can't go wrong with the Rock, though."
3,The Rock Thermos Bottle,"Great bottle, keeps coffee hot for a very long time, HOWEVER, the stopper is junk. Have already purchased 2 replacements and need to purchase more because they are only good for a year or two and then they fall apart. First time was OK, could purchase the stopper from Thermos. Now they do not carry replacement parts. Choice is now..........do I go on to something else or spend another $30.99 plus shipping just to get a new stopper!!! Bad deal!"
3,a decent thermos with some workmanship issues,"I purchased this product a couple months back. I was pleased to find that it genuinely doesn't leak; a problem that I've had with several other brands. Unfortunately, the workmanship in the cup is substandard. I had the unit for about three days before the cup completely came apart. I have tried to fix it with superglue, but it continues to break regularly. The problem is that there is not enough insulation between the plastic cup and the outer metal shell. Thus, when the glue or adhesive is applied, the insulation is not making physical contact with the inside of the metal outer shell.I didn't return the product because it doesn't leak, and that's the feature that I need the most. Summary : it's decent, but could be significantly improved relatively easily."
2,After first day of use the lid separates!!!!,The title really says it all...I brewed 8 cups worth of coffee and albeit the product does a great job at keeping it warm all through the day. I dare say I could find an equally low quality build for much cheaper!! I only wish the person that gifted this to me had given me the receipt as well so I could return it. This item was not bought through Amazon.
5,Love this book!,"I really love this book. It has cute ideas and the pictures make it hard for you to mess it up. I mainly bought it for the cute mermaid globe on the cover but found that I liked quite a few of the other figures as well. What I like best is all the different techniques, especially the ones using metal leaf. Its not just 'make this shape, this shape, and stick em together', theres lots of clay blending techniques along with it so you can make color swirls, add glitter, and some cane methods. I've never used a pasta machine before so the tips there were helpfull. I'm for the most part a beginner so I was looking for a book that would give me a good idea how to start and some fun techiniques to play with on my own and this book was exactly what I was looking for."
4,Intelligent dialogue for an indie horror film...,"As far as an indie horror/sci-fi film goes, Subhuman was an intriguing surprise. The film is carried by the X-file type dialogue between the lead character Martin, and everyone else. The acting and effects are okay. However, the conversations and the deep significance of the subject matter as Martin relates his ""mission"" to others is very well done.The movie is worth a watch just for the dialogue alone.G.D."
2,Ugh...,"The majority of the reviews here are the correct ones. Awkward story telling, bad acting (with the exception of the main guy, MacDonald - a stand out amongst the rest of the poor cast) The reviewer below is correct: The rest of the cast ARE people to look out for - look out for them on C Movies for the rest of their careers...blech..."
1,4 stars???? are you high? want some wine with that?,"This is basically a really bad vampire hunter movie. It is sort of like Blade, but to compare it (or contrast it) to Blade in the same sentence is an insult to blade, and the whole horror movie industry. This movie is really bad. The picture qaulity looks like a home video, but even worse than that(adult movie qaulity if you will). It has a grainy picture. It has really bad actors and actresses. It has some of the worst special effects I have seen in awhile. Like rubber arms and rubber heads. It has really generic blood. I honestly could not sit through this movie. I stopped it about half way. I started to skim through it because when it wasn't generic and cheesy, it was just plain boring. Stay away! Oh and this other reviewer: X-RaySpex ""X-Ray"" guy needs to put down the pipe. He is either severely handicap, or he had something to do with the making of this dumb movie, this isn't even close to 4 stars."
4,Very informative,"My friends and I are not food people but we love mind challenging games. Food Lover's Trivia is definitely a thought provoking and humbling way to discover food facts. I especially like that there's no board. I live in a small apartment with hardly any living room space. With 6 adults on my birthday armed with fruits, cheese, beer, dice, timer, and game cards - we had a feast on my tiny coffee table."
3,"Works pretty good, issue is with seperate handle.","The splatter screen works great,is the perfect size, and is very easy to clean.There are two draw backs to this product:First, is the seperate handle, it has fallen off twice while i've had the screen on a hot pan.....makes it very tricky to put it back on...when you have splattering grease.Second draw back with the handle is where do you keep it? I stand the splatter screen up on edge in the cabinet with my cookie sheets....but what to do with the handle? So it goes in the drawer with other cooking utensils. just not as convienent as I thought it would be.After using it several times, I would now have prefered one with a folding handle that stays attached."
1,Poorly designed kitchen item.,"The silicone splatter screen itself is about twice as effective as a traditional splatter screen, but the removable handle is very unstable and does not stay attached to the screen. This design flaw basically makes the device unusable.The label accompanying the splatter screen notes that, ""The handle is specially shaped for comfort and to assure a good grip - the removable handle does not heat up during cooking - the removable handle makes the screen easy to store."" These statements may be true, but if the handle doesn't stay attached to the screen then using the screen poses a threat of grease burns or worse. Frankly, I don't feel this device rates even one star."
3,Decent Shield But Handle is Wobbly,"The shield itself is nice, but the handle does not screw on (merely 'hooks' on) so at times it seems a little wobbly. If you could screw it on, it would be a wonderful shield."
1,"Scratched, dented and badly packed.",These did not come in any retail packaging. On top of that the quality of finish was bad. They were scratched and dented. The mechanism didn't fit the other half well at all and there was a slight clicking noise whenever they were turned.I had bought for the entire house but I just returned them all and moved to Kwikset which were of a far higher quality.
4,Two thumbs up,"I replaced an old Schlage knob with a new one. It was easy to install and works well. I am curious to see how the polished chrome holds up because the brass one I replaced was looking pretty sad. To be fair, it was several years old and the protective patina had worn off, but I don't know that the polished chrome will ever look as quite as bad as the shiny brass. You might want to keep that in mind if you're thinking about buying brass, but the finish is better now..."
1,Square cornered faceplate no longer included,"Schlage bed and bath lock set (F40 V PLY 605) NO LONGER INCLUDES the square-cornered faceplate. The instructions say it is ""optional"" but provide no information on where to purchase it.The square-cornered faceplate is included in the Springlatch Replacement Part kit but that costs an ADDITIONAL $11.00 and all I need is the square faceplate -- not the entire latch assembly. I have about ten locksets I want to replace: $11.00 X 10 = $110 for faceplates.Bottom line: Getting this small ""optional"" item has become a major hassle. And Schlage customer service has not returned my call."
4,Not Quite as Advertised,"Not a bad set. I bought this set to replace leaking brass fittings and it does the job. The price was right, although they weren't Campbell Hausfeld brand. I was careful about tightening the fittings on the blow gun because it felt ""spindly"" to me. I take good care of my tools, so it works for me."
4,In process of evaluating.,"I already tried few pieces of this set, they work fine so far. I will follow up on comment when try I'll them all."
2,sorry...,"I feel sorry, Charlie Wood is a master on B3, but this Cd is far away from his first release,the bass pedals sound is confused,and the whole songs aren't very inspired.Good arrangement and good graphic work on the cover.I'm sure the next will be better!Keep groovin' Charlie..."
5,Great Value,"This cooler works great for the price. Items are kept cold/warm and the temperature cools and heats quickly. *Don't leave it turned on for too long, it will drain your vehicle battery very quickly."
3,Small and Rugged Travel Cooler,"Cooler is sturdy, but power cord door hinge is weak, be careful not to fatigue break it. Power cord is just over 7ft long. Rated 45 watt consumption... bought Powerline 0900-56 12-Volt DC-AC/1000 mA Power Socket from Amazon to use with AC power inside house. Cooling performance could be better... at 70F room temp, with empty cooler, maintains 50F temp inside cooler. Perhaps good enough for car trip, but not days of storage. For $50, I would expect better cooling, e.g. 40F when room temp was 70F. Be sure to pre-cool drinks, etc., before placing in cooler. I'm keeping cooler because nothing else seems to be available like it. Would I buy this cooler again ? Sure, since it does keep things inside cool without having to add ice or freeze pack inside."
4,Good bargain,"Pros: keeps things cool enough to leave in your car for extended periods on hot days, also holds the temperature for a decent amount of time if there's a loss of power. Holds a 12 pack of cans plus the 2 drink slots in the front, so there's plenty of storage. Nice storage spot for the ac plug & it comes apart to replace possible blown fuses. Haven't had a chance to try the hot setting due to the hot summer season.Cons: it's a bit on the long side so it may be tricky riding shotgun in smaller vehicles. The 2 drink holders in the front aren't able to be chilled or heated.All in all worth the price."
1,It doesn't work,"I bought this cooler for a road trip, as I wanted to store food for my toddler. I had it charging for more than 12 hours prior to our trip at home ( I have also bought a power adaptor for home)and it was not cold at all. Eventually, I placed a few things in there and I also put a small bottle of frozen water so as to keep everything cool and that is how it worked. At the end of our trip the ice was melted!! I wish a had bought a regular cooler than this useless product. Also bear in mind that is really small so it's not worth the money."
2,cool cooler,great little cooler!! It worked great for about 3 days on a road trip till the fan started making noise and the cigaret adapter melted. the fuse never blew. I only gave it 2 for this reason. If the company would use a better quality parts then it would be a great cooler. we liked the part about being portable just put it on your shoulder and go. Amazon did give us a refund that was also nice.
2,Not worth the money,may be i should have paid attention to the product title. These bottles are really small when compared to the similar product for mens. I would really encourage you to get a look at the same product in the mall or some other shopping place. Besides there is not a lot of discount at Amazon on this.Overall i got what i paid for but no real savings for buying at Amazon for this product and i did not find the product very useful for any body.
2,shipwrecked IS a wreck,"i just got this today and maybe it will grow on me but i think its unlikely. first, i cannot figure out how to watch the entire live show straight through. instead it seems i have to watch chapter by chapter. how annoying is that? also, why is it that so many producers opt for putting effects on top of the live footage? i just wanna see the musicians performing! i don't need the gimmicks! finally, Vortex has completely ruined all the songs which were originally sung by ""Trickster G"". he used to be pretty good but his more recent work is terrible. another case in point: Dimmu's 'In Sorte Diaboli'"
2,Broken cover,The wiper is fine. Just like the original. Only problem was that the little cap that covers the mounting nut was broken.
4,Good but sticky keys,"I have a WR108 purchased in 2007. I just had to replace the Ni-MH battery, so that's not too bad. The worst problem with this model is that the keys are a bit sticky. You either have to press on them in just the right place, or, to unstick it, snap the edge of the key with a thumbnail almost like playing tiddly winks. I'd still buy it, but it would be nice if they improve the design some."
2,O.K. but user interface is a DISASTER,The user interface is an adolescent geeks but an adult's nightmare. Frustrating to use and you must keep manual at the ready to do battle with the radio.
2,"Looks good, but don't depend on it.","I received an Oregon Scientific WR108 as a Christmas gift. After reading all of the setup instructions and verifying SAME codes with the National Weather Service, I programmed the unit as directed. In the four weeks that I have had the unit, there have been four scheduled weekly test and a number of alert and watch transmissions, none of which activated the radio. I have been unable to get any response from Oregon Scientific customer support. I would not recommend this unit if you are looking for something that will alert you to a potential hazardous situation. As a device to listen to NOAA broadcasts it works fine, but you can do that with any number significantly cheaper radios that include a weather band."
5,Perfect craftsmanship,I would have loved to have done the research for this book myself.these farm buildings are beautifully made by people who understood wood and their suroundings perfectly.
3,V-Series Kodak Camera Case,The Kodak Camera Case for my Kodak V1253 Digital camera fits fine and easy to use for the camera.
3,"3 gems, 15 potboilers","During his time with The Shadows, Jet Harris was, in my view, one of the great bass guitarists, laying the foundation that was later built upon by Paul McCartney and others. Listen toNivram, or36-24-36. Compare the bass line ofSleepwalkwithSanto & Johnny's original, particularly in the middle eight.Outside The Shadows, however, for whatever reasons, his inspiration and/or material failed. It did, however, manage to produce two superb UK Top Five hits (written — probably not coincidentally — by Jerry Lordan, composer ofApache), and one good one. A traumatic car crash then, unfortunately, clamped the lid down on his career.This album thus comprises three gems and fifteen pot-boilers of varying degrees of listenability.If you're a hard-core fan, then, buy the album. If you're not, buy it anyway for the three gems: Diamonds, Scarlett O'Hara and Applejack. OnlyDiamondsis available as an MP3 on Amazon US; whole album is available on Amazon UK."
5,Dewalt Hammer Drill/Saw Combo,"Great tools... the best and most powerful cordless tools I have used. After using the Amazon Credit card and getting the reduction in price, the cost was the best I have been able to find. Was shipped in good order and time and was exactly what I was looking for."
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"I was really disappointed with the Tremere Clan Trilogy!! Aisling Sturbridge is one of my favorite characters in Vampire the Masquerade, and I really looked forward to reading the trilogy. What a let-down. The story is weak, with not much mention of blood magic or thaumaturgy, and the storyline about "" the children down the well "" is ridiculous. Don't waste your time or your money on this! The Lasombra Clan Trilogy was infinitely better and written well."
1,A huge disappointment,"I had such high hopes for this book/CD based on the reviews. While I speak Spanish, I hoped to augment my vocabulary in this particular area. Instead, I found that the speaker on the tape was difficult to understand, many words were translated inaccurately or into substandard Spanish, and the translations didn't account for gender or singular/plural differences. This has extremely limited usefulness. It certainly doesn't live up to the other comments."
3,"Mas dispasio y uno mas, por favor.","The book is a great reference. Very well broken down into specific sections for quick reference to each situation. However the audio book is lacking. The audio book does not reference the whole book, only the high points. The speaker tells the english phrase and follows it up quickly with the spanish. However, the spanish is only spoken one time. Minimal time is available to recite the spanish before the next english phrase is stated. The CD is an adiquate reference, but I was looking for a true audio CD that can be independant from the book, and this is not it."
3,Second Guess,"Expected a diferent song that I heard a few years back, the intent was there, but the words were not as racy as I remembered."
5,"Beautiful, Romantic, Facinating","This book is a story about an English princess who was married to a mad king of Denmark. Like Mary of Scots she became involved in a high profile affair. This book is well researched, emotionally moving, and written with a nearly extinct flare. A very good read!"
5,"upt, one point for the British.","I caught this show on comedy central back two years ago, and I finally got a credit card to buy this! (first thing I actually used it on.) The TV show itself had me laughing for hours- days- no I'm still laughing. The only complaint I had was I did not realize this tape only had three episodes on it. I was left in my dark room trying to remember what happened. If you're going to buy this, make sure you pick up the whole series. It's worth every penny. The three ""gentlemen"" who act out these parts are perfect. Sometimes you wonder who plays who or if it is even one of the three. It'd take us Americans a team of 30 to come up with half of the things the four writers think up in one sitting. Hat's off to them all. And if you don't find it funny, then go back to watching friends."
5,Review of University Wealth by Marleen Geyen,Marleen's book is extremely well written and easy to understand. It is very organized and easy to follow. Each chapter includes questions and answers that are very helpful. I recommend this book!
5,Great Book about Milo,"I bought this book for about $1. It arrived quickly. I then sent it to the Astros for Milo to autograph. I told him I'd listened to him when I lived in Birmingham in the 60s and 70s as the Braves announcer. Years later I moved to Texas and had the opportunity to listen to him as the Astros announcer.Milo returned the book signed and I began to read the book. Milo tells his life story as an announcer and tells the truth from his perspective about the other announcers he has worked with. He isn't vulgar but he is truthful.If you love baseball, Milo or the teams he has announced for, this book is for you. He provides insight to the clubs and management. An easy read and worth much more than the $1 I paid for it. To me, it's priceless."
2,Very Disappointing,"I loved to listen to Milo when he did the White Sox games on WCFL in the early 60s. I enjoyed Milo when he was interviewed by Roy Firestone on the old Mazda Sports Look on ESPN back in the late 80s/early 90s.I agree with a previous reviewer that it seems like a book written by a grumpy old man. I might add that it's a pretty self-indulging book. I read the reviews before I got the book from the library, and only made a special request because I loved Milo hoping that I would enjoy the book. Although writing the book for Milo might have been therapy for him, Milo should have then thrown it out. Milo's thoughts would have been better left unsaid. I might add that I'm not a fan of Harry Carey & other announcers that he trashed in the book. Actually there aren't many people that Milo didn't trash."
1,bitter and uninteresting,"It is amazing that milo has been in the buisness as long as he has and has nothing interesting to say. The only question i had after reading this book, is why was it written. furthermore, why was it published. If you have ever heard him call a game you know that he is a very boring, lackluster personality. I regret buying this and wish i had not wasted my time on this book. If you are thinking of buyin this book, don't."
3,This tape leaves you wanting more.,"This mixtape has its hot moments, but in general M.O.P.'s verses are short even though they are good. Some times they rhyme on a nice beat but they only have one verse then the track plays out. There aren't enough verses. Some of the songs are not up to M.O.P. standard but since its a mixtape I just enjoy having something to listen to until Ghetto Warfare. When they first dropped Warriorz I had that in my player for like 2 months straight. That album was M.O.P. at their best. I want that kind of heat on Ghetto Warfare. There are small hints of that heat on Marxmen Cinema but don't expect too much its only a mixtape."
5,Really Good,"Was looking for a indoor bike trainer. Got a killer deal on Amazon. Was a little nervous about ordering such a big thing online, but, Amazon's customer service has always been great. Trucking company called and set a date. Box was in good shape. Took me about an hour, working very slowly, to put the bike together. It really was easy. The bike is super quiet and has a lot of nice features. It was extremely well packed and I am very happy with the product, price and service."
1,A poor portrayal,"there is way too much hype about this work and as far as artistic value it lacks in effective style and the images are nothing radiant. I have and can do better with a 35mm camera outdoors. the effects are way too mechanical, as are the appearances of the subjects, to stiff, too pre-set or staged. nothing surprizing and candid. this book was a big dissapointment! actually some photos actually appear as if there were ""photoshopped"" for this voulume. dont waste your money, there is nothing here worth seeing."
4,What photography is supposed to be.,"These are wonderful, sensitive pictures. All of them document the human figure (both male and female) in many of its ages. It's a topic that can never get old, not as long as the viewer is human too.Normally, I don't have strong response to photography as art. At first, I simply enjoyed the peaceful scenes and happy people that Sturges portrays. Many of his subject are young people, though, and my mind drifted back to myself at their age. Somehow, it all came rushing back to me: that sense of mystery and awe, about fifth grade, when I first started seeing the girls around me becoming young women. Sturges has a unique talent for showing the steps between child and adult with respect and innocence. I was not prepared for the evoked memory of myself at that innocent age.This book collects some of the most beautiful figure studies I've ever seen. I truly hope that you can appreciate it the way it was mean to be seen."
2,Very Disappointing,"Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I found this book of photographs by Jock Sturges very disappointing. The photos were dull and lifeless, and the subjects very ordinary. I was not ""disturbed"" or ""challenged"" by this series of photos as I assumed I was supposed to be by Jock's photography. In fact, it wasn't interesting at all."
4,"Beautiful work, great book to own","Mr. Sturges second book, by now he'd fully developed the style his fans all know so well. Some of his best nudes, and clothed portraits, are featured here. This is one of the better photo books I've got, maybe one of Sturges better books.The most notable feature are perhaps the two contributed essays, the one at the front of the book quotes unidentified subjects of Mr. Sturges on their feelings about posing for him, you won't find anything else like that until the most recent book ""Notes""."
5,Stunning.,"Many of the images in this book hold me totally spellbound, even after enjoying it (in hardcopy) for several years. I experience a sense of ""beckoning"", a call to enter the images and pursue the stories that most of them so strongly hint at. The cover photo so captivated me that I bought a official/authorized print of it."
4,Spagetti and Meatballs for all!,This book is a good resource for introducing math strategies into a class lesson. The graphics are interesting and the language is well presented.
1,Pamphlet,"I should know better than to buy books with arbitrary numbers in the title; ""101 this,"" ""60 days to that,"" ""10 simple whatever."" How many mistakes did the authors really think of and how long did it take them to pad out the number to reach 101?All that aside, this book reads like a PowerPoint presentation and with a good speaker it might be a really good one, but it doesn't make for compelling reading material. After 30 pages I was just scanning the bullet points.The information and advice is valid (for the most part) but there just isn't enough of it here to justify a book."
3,Rudimentary,"I acquired this book following the recommendations on Amazon. I have found this book to be rather rudimentary. By an large, the underlying problems for the 'mistakes' are simply those of professionalism and leadership. I'd expect that at the managerial level, adequate experience has been gained, competency demonstrated, not to fall into such caveats."
3,Kinda Happy,The sword is a 20 dollar sword. It was in good condition as pictured but the craftsmen ship on it was really bad. If you buy this sword you will have to look at it more than touch it.I am selling mine.
2,I Know why the Caged Bird Sings,"I dont really have a review. i really just wanted notes in a book i am supposed to read for school. Instead of giving me cliff notes or even a summary, I get this sight adking me if i want to bye the fricking book when i already have it. i have read the book, I just want notes to do journal entries on so i dont fail the fricking class. So thanks for nothing. This site sucks. and I dont want to follow you guidlines. I dont care about your guidlines. i dont care if this gets posted or not. I just want to say that i couldnt find notes here or anywhere and your sight pisses me off the most. if you are at all offended by my opinions, Im sorry in advance but that still doesnt get me the notes i need and that really pisses me off that Imapoligizing to you for something i didnt get but need desperatley.and im 15 not twelve. send me to jail for lying but i know this wont be posted so i dont care all that much who reads this and who doesnt."
3,15 amps. Cup not fit well. 6 oz. capacity. water not too hot,"Thanks to the other posters. if working this:a) puts on a bright red light (right side) when on, andb) brews immediately..spitting out little bits of water at a time.I tried this with a wagan ac to dc converter model 9903.Well the converter is useless and only puts out 5 amps. The coffee maker is 15.The cup that comes with coffee maker is cute.Stainless..with nice handles..does not go with the little unit that well.Have not tried making coffee yet.Water is NOT super hot..definitely drinkable immediately. Not sure if you could put plan water through twice and make it hotter.I think it will be good. but drink it fast...Wagan Tech Item 2307 personal Mini coffee maker.I like the color (black) shape (sleek), of the maker, etc.Box says cord is 8 feet. It is three."
5,Another Outstanding Offering Of Praise,"I have all but one of Larnelle's albums, and his music has never failed to inspire me. His love for Our Savior comes through soft and strong. For the person who asked about the album title (by Larnelle) on which you find ""His Eye Is On The Sparrow""....try ""I've Just Seen Jesus."""
3,The Book's Title is Very Misleading!!!,"""Explanations for all three LSAT-item types"" not all 3 tests!The title on the cover of this book is ""LSAT The Official Tripleprep Plus With Explanations."" However, this book essentially contains 3 preptests with basic answers -- the only explanations given are for only ONE test, which really doesn't cover the whole test but only 10 questions for the reading, arguments, and games section. Please click on the picture of the book and look at its table of contents . . . you'll notice this fact.At its current price, you are much better getting the ""10 Actual, Official LSAT Preptests."" (If you need explanations and strategies, get ""Master the LSAT"" by Nova or ""The Official LSAT Prep Test with Explanations"" which contains FULL explanations for one test.)"
2,Curling Iron,I did not like these curlers at all. They did not heat up enough and they just did not work. The only reason I did not send them back is because I destroyed the package (will never do that again). Very disappointed
2,Better for Curly Hair,"If your hair is already curly or wavy this product is great for adding some more structure or calming frizz, but it doesnt work well on straight hair. They take a really long time to heat up and they don't even get very hot. If you do end up using this product i recommend using a lot of hair spray or mousse."
4,good,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00066YC34/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleIt works fine my problem is that it doesn't have and on and off switch, you just have to plug it on to use and unplug when finish but then again you get what you pay for"
1,I didn't get this product on amazon but....,"I got this at like Cvs and I have thick long hair I use so much sculpting gel , mousse and hair spray after spending 3 hours doing my hair and only made it through like 2 hours of dinner the rest of the night my hair was normal and straight as always I thought my hair was just impossible but it wasn't me it was the product!"
3,GREAT AT FIRST,THIS ITEM WAS GREAT AT FIRST BUT AFTER A FEW MONTHS THEY DONT WORK. HAVE HAD MANY OF THIS ITEM FROM MY BIRTHDAY AND ALL WERE THE SAME. AFTER A FEW MONTHS THEY DONT WORK ANY MORE SORRY TO LET YOU ALL KNOW BUT THERE CRAP BUT IF YOU WANT THEM ENJOY!
1,Item not as advertised,"I ordered this product based on the description on Amazon. The curling irons were supposed to have an ""On/Off"" switch AND variable heat settings. There was no heat setting or On/OFF switch. Also..when I ordered the item it was one price and 3 days later it was advertised on Amazon for $4 less.Returned the item and got a refund within a few days."
1,Worst product ever,My daughter bought this yesterday after I warned her not to however she did purchase it and I cannot believe how bad this product really was. It never got hot and would not curl hair in the least. It was a BIG waste of money!!!! My advice is to put more money into it and purchase a better product!!!
3,Good Deal,I got these three in a pack and only use the smallest one because I have very fine hair. I only paid $20 for the three and am happy with them.
3,Ehhh,"I thought that the fact that they sold the curlers in a set, that it was more convenient since I didn't want to buy curlers seperately. They didn't work too well though. If you were to move the cord around, the red light turns on and off, and it doesn't get heated properly. If you buy it i recommend you preheating it half an hour earlier and put it at a position where the red light stays on."
5,curl,"Bought this as a gift, they are using them and seem to like the different sizes. It is great for the money."
2,Social Justice class textbook,"This book is great for pulling discussion questions from as it presents many things to think about. It is written by a white male and the entire book is about white privilege, which adds a layer of paradox to it."
3,A book that has good implications,"All together this is a good book that delves into the miasma of privilege and how it applies to having power amongst relative societies and levels of societies. He also talks about the differences between people and how that might actually lead to the giving of privilege. Altogether, it's a decent book, one that you should certainly read if you these issues of power and privilege bother you."
1,Worst book I have ever read,"Absolutely worst book I have ever read it generalizes and throws out assertions without any content to back it up... this book has a decent rating but a massive amount of 1 star ratings because if you have more then 2 brain cells or can take more then the gentlest of words this book will try to coddle you and only insult even the most modest of intellects. If you like to think about what the author says and have spent 5 seconds studying history you will hack up a lung when the author ignores conflicts, and immigration as reasons for racial stereotypes and tries so hard to make WASP straight guys look like bigoted racist pricks and spread hatred for whites without even trying to do anything about the problems of racial discrimination in the US, as if throwing blame will fix everything."
1,presumptious and not groundeed in reality,This book is really a bad choice for a diversity class. This guy suffers from white gult or something and has the tendency to victimize everyone for being anthing other than being a white male. As a disabled person that teaches children disability sensitivity this guy needs to come hear me and my colleagues to learn a thing or two.Please dont spead this kind of ignorance. He redefines things at his convience and it infuriates me to no end.
5,Great inspirational book,"This was a required book for my philosophy class. Privilege, Power, and Difference is one of my favorite books, I loved it. The book has been very inspiring to me, I am a college student and also a journalist on the side, it has inspired me to speak out even more. This book challenges politically correctness and forces the reader to deal with ideologies that are crippling our culture. The book was ahead of its time in regards to the Occupy Wall Street movement as well. Everyone should be reading this book right now, it speaks right to the movement and to the current events that are unfolding. Highly Recommended and honest."
2,Eh,"I had to get this book for class. It wasn't great; it wasn't terrible. I feel it is too one-sided and very, very redundant. Could focus a lot more on what to do instead of what has been done."
1,Useless and Worthless,"This book is required for an English class I am taking. The author has never been discrimated against in any way but makes many unfounded claims about race, gender and ability. I just want to know how someone can write a book full of their own opinions when they have no experience with the subject. This author is ridiculous."
1,White Racism,"$32.53 paperback - 171 pages of textseveral pages of Notes - one note alone references approx 50 books/articlesseven pages of Resources - approx 150 authors, did notice Andrea DworkinFolksy, casual writing style speaking ""truth to power"", that is, how ""white racism"" and capitalism is oppressing, well, pretty much everyone else. Other than providing the means of a ""shout out"" to every progressive author of the last decade, there just isn't that much information there - about the same as a mass-market paperback of 170 pages, for $32.53 (plus taxes), and in classrooms across the nation!So I guess that, in addition to his diversity classes, Doctor Johnson is doing OK with that capitalism thing....."
1,Grating,"I found Owen to be a sullen little snot, making it impossible for me to have any sympathy for him or his plight. His story became one I could care less about. As with all of Avi's books, this one was well written, pity the main character was intolerable."
5,Simply fantastic...,"The best part of this cd is Lenz' unique singing, and her special rockin' delivery. The cover is really cool, a sort of recreation of Gene Vincent's old lp. Although Lenz sings about 10 times better than Vincent ever could, and she sure is btter lookin'!!! The backup musicians are similar to the Blue Caps, and Lenz is a superb storyteller, and has a lot of energy in her performances. A great cd, well worth acquiring if you like rockabilly, tah tswings, more then it rocks."
2,"Something's Wrong, Kim....","I was looking forward to hearing this album due to the low-key buzz surrounding it. Good, pure, traditional roots-country-rockabilly is hard to find and able female vocalists are even more rare. But that's where this album falls short. The playing is competent (although the energy was a little lacking), the songs were well written, but Kim's vocals forced me to take this one out of the CD player after just a few songs. What's with the exaggerated voice? Why not just sing? Isn't the goal to entertain, not irritate? Why doesn't someone in the band say something? In all fairness, maybe Kim comes across better live. But if you're looking for good old-fashioned rip-it- up female vocal rockabilly, it's best to save your money and look elsewhere."
2,this is not that good although i appreciate the effort,"this is one of the more annoying vocal records ive heard. i love rockabilly. the music is good on this. the band is a competent band. kim might not sound so bad if she just relaxed and sang. it seems at times like she has a good voice. but through most of the cd you cant tell. she sounds out of breath, almost trying too hard to sing this. all the hype iv'e heard about this performer, i wish would have been a little more well founded. i also found the duplication of gene vincent's album cover to be somewhat rediculous considering Gene Vincent's status as a rockabilly legend. I myself wouldn't have the ego to do something like that, i mean c'mon we're talking about Gene and the blue caps here!!"
4,Works!,"Good and simple design, easy to install. My chimney flue is oblong shaped, so the the L metal pieces on the length side are positioned inside of the flue, but I bent them outward and that solved the issue! It is slightly wobbly after installed due to the simplistic adjustable-fit design, but I think it is going to stay there even in high wind. We'll see!"
4,So far it works,"I bought this several months ago and I finally got someone to install it. So far, it seems to be working okay."
5,misinformation leads to continued victimization,"Oftentimes, lay people as well as professionals respond to perceptions of child sexual abuse that have no basis in fact. The impact of sexual abuse does not always follow a straight and logical path. However, research in the field of child sexual abuse clearly indicates that it has long-term negative consequences for which its victims and their families are not prepared. Narrowly focused studies such as Rind, Tromovitch, and Bauserman only serve to misinform society and perpetuate the notion that sex with children is equivalent to sex with adults, further exacerbating the problem. This book presents evidence based on a broad review of the research literature that indicates sex with children is harmful to the victims and society."
2,Both Sexual Abuse and False Claims of Sexual Abuse are Real,"The author makes an important case for taking sexual abuse seriously. However, defending a particular person against false claims of abuse is not the same as denying the reality of sexual abuse in general. Also, not all erotic relationships commonly seen as 'sexual' abuse are involuntary or harmful to the minor, as has been rediscovered through the work of Rind, Tromovitch and Bauserman, and others.Realism is a matter of taking all sides, facets and dimensions seriously. In present-day society there is a general tendency to over-simplify by ignoring data rather than integrating them in our world-view or theory. Misinformation is allways wrong.Titus Rivas"
3,Almost objective,I read this book before and wanted to have an edition in my library .the only issue is that it lacked the photographs originally obtained and published by the London Sunday times insight team field reporters and editorsWonder if there is an edition out here that has those photographs included .
1,Not worth the trouble,"If you really want this item, go to a store and pick them out yourself. Make sure the lid fits tightly. When I ordered for delivery, the first shipment contained a broken lid, and I had to return the whole shipment for one lousy lid replacement. UPS will not pick-up from my rural address, so my brother had to make a 200 mile round trip from Chicago just to take me and the shipment 7 miles to the UPS drop-off center. The replacement shipment was in even worse shape. Two of the four lids were broken, and one of the whole ones does not fit tightly enough to be airtight. I will never buy another Iris product."
4,My Thoughts on Diary of the Other Woman,"I throughly enjoyed the diary. While I can sympathize with the author's feelings I have to say that she seemed very hostile - very angry. I guess this is a part of the emotional package when you're involved in that kind of relationship. However - even though she was young when the relationship began - she chose to remain for the length of time that she did. While she did not openly fault her lover she gave the unmistakeable impression that she blamed him. Over all I will have to say aside from the obvious anger at her lover; I thought the book was right on target. It is a great read for anyone in or thinking about getting involved with a married man. Ladies don't do it - if you're in it ""get out while you can""."
5,An introduction to Bio Cranial Therapy,This is by far the greatest healing arts book of the 21st century. Dr. Boyed helps us to understand healing in a whole new light as he explains the causes and treatment of many of the afflictions of our time.
4,nice coffee table book,"This is a gorgeous book, but it hasn't been as usefull as I was hoping. There are many odd kinds of margaritas in here, which is great if that's what you like. But there was only one regular margarita recipe, and it was the kind I was hoping for. If you just look up recipes online, you're more likely to find the recipe you're looking for, since this one only has about 10 recipes. But as a coffee table book, it's perfect!"

If you just look up recipes online, you're more likely to find the recipe you're looking for, since this one only has about 10 recipes. But as a coffee table book, it's perfect!"
5,Wonderful Utensil Set,"This set makes a wonderful present. I gave it to my husband for a special occasion, and he thought it was so nice that he doesn't want to use it except on other special occasions! I guess I better buy him another one. I love the company that offers this set, and I have bought from them since buying the bamboo utensils. They make good stuff."
5,Love them.,I would definitely recommend this shoe to anyone. So comfortable and true to size. Can't wait to buy more of them.
5,Love Easy Spirit slip ons,Have bought Easy Spirit slip on for about 4 years now. I love them. They always are true to size. Some of them I actually throw in the washing machine and they come out looking brand new. Have in many patterns. Would definately order again. Quality excellent.
5,I love them,"I love easy spirit traveltime, slip on, The fit was perfect and the support is great. Would tell every one to buy this shoe."
3,Just one cut is worth the price,"I bought this CD (along with ""Classics and Boogie: the Original...""), just for the unbelievable rendition of the piano soloist Jack Fina, in dialogue with F.M.'s orchestra, of the ""Bumble Boogie"", based on Rimsky-Korsakoff's well-known piece: it was part of the Walt Disney's full-length cartoon movie ""Melody Time"" of 1948, and I had been looking for it since 1950! Except for the few introductory orchestral bars, it's all here with all its piano wizardry. Just this piece makes the purchase of this CD worthwhile."
4,Awesome Story,I just finished this book last night after not being able to put it down the last 40 or 50 pages.I liked Pete's writing style and attention to detail sharing. After spending a former life in the Air Force and in Aviation after getting out and studying survival techniques the book was very very interesting. It kept me on the edge of my seat; I could almost feel the anguish he experienced.Awesome Story
2,excruciating,"ok, if deleo really survived/hiked two weeks across that kind of terrain, he is to be commended. and if, as is obvious, he made some serious errors as a pilot, and got his friends killed, that should be noted as well. the bottom line is this book is mildly interesting, but the writing style is repetitive and excruciating and like others i found myself skimming just to get through it. so i base my review on the quality of the read, not the external factors. i was glad to move onto something more solid/stimulating."
5,true human grit,This is the kind of book everone should read. How far can you really push yourself if it is a life or death situation? The auther of this book went far beyond the norm. It was hard to put the book down. Nature was preductable and unpredictabe. Any one who ventures into the snow should read this book. I read this book and my grown kids have read the book. We all recomend it.
5,Keith's review,"I enjoyed this book a lot! I probably would not have read this book if I not know the author, Peter Deleo, who is also the survivor. But I'm glad I took his advice and at least read the first ten pages. Because after that I could not put the book down. This story is a true story. It is a book that my that my father's and uncle's friend wrote. It is a story about when Peter crashed a single engine plane in the Sierra Nevadas. He hiked many snow covered mountains for thirteen days with sixteen broken bones to save his life and the the lives of his two fellow passengers, Lloyd and Wave. I don't really want to give away too much information, but I will tell you that Peter never gave up. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure and excitement. But I feel that anyone can read this book and enjoy it. I also think that any person can read this book and be deeply moved by Peter's incredible journey through the Sierra Nevadas."
2,Pretty good deal,"Not a bad deal - I was looking for inexpensive mitts for a kickboxing class that I teach on Saturdays, and that's what I got! Good for the price I paid."
4,A must-read for anyone dealing with special needs kids!,"This book really hit home for me. As a mother of a child with special needs, the stories told by these women validated my feelings, and mirrored some of my personal experiences. The stories range from heart-warming to tear-inducing...but every one rings with honesty. A good read...take some time to ponder this one, then pass it on to your child's doctor, therapist, or teacher."
5,One of the Best Science Fiction Novels in recent years...,"Katz has written a great book. It is a true science fiction adventure with incredibly well-drawn characters and worlds that you will remember long after you finish. It conjures up Herbert, Heinlein, plus has a modern SF tone and style to it. A must-read for anyone who enjoys a well-written, entertaining book filled with interesting ideas."
1,A novel of what?,"First, this is an example of an author reviewing their own book numerous times. Look at the anonymous reviews with little say other than how great the book is above.Simply. This book sucks.It's not a novel of the future. The structure of the book fits no narrative flow. There's no hook. No inciting incident. The author then meanders around, expecting the reader to enjoy the thoughts tossed out. The escalating conflict seems to be missing. And a climactic scene? Where?So.The author can keep posting five star reviews on his own book to keep his rating up. Good luck. Bye."
5,TENDERLY SWEET,HI.everyone gues what i went to toys r us and amazon.com and i saw these hamsters. i thaught they were just too tenderly sweet for me. so i asked my mum over like abillion times. Can i get this mom no she said.2 minutes later can i get this mom no she said AGAIN.then i really started begging her that she just suddenly agreeed. now just remember don't always beg your parents cause the secret is if you ask your parents once and they say no then be really good for about a week and then they might surprise you with you'r special tenderly sweet toy. so now remember i am and always will be raiting 5 stars. so just please try to test this. boys might even like it. if you listen to me and get it you can/could still return it okay BI FRIENDS!!!!!!!!!!you really did me a fauvor.
5,Very Cute!,"My mom just got this for me yesturday and I really love it. Since I am not allowed to have a real hamster, this playset is a nice substitute. Each hamster is different. I like to put each one in the wheel to exercise it and pretend to give it water from it's water bottle. Afterwards, I put them in their big chamber where they could sleep in their bedding. I can't wait to collect the other animals!"
5,AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"They are SO CUTE! I like everything about them! I really like how they come with the ""wood chips"" and how the water bottle bottle is almost all the way clear so it looks like there is ""water"" in the bottle. My real hamster recently died,""sigh"", so I really liked gettling these because they are a good memory.P.s. They are SO CUTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,My review of Christy,"I saw the television series when it first came out. I enjoyed it, however, because of the TV Station switching the times as to when it would be shown, I was not able to see it to its end. I just recently read the book....it was great! I bought the video of the tv series and found it to be wanting in comparison to the book. Allot of liberties were taken with the television series and it did not follow the book very well. On the whole though, it was interesting and a good Drama for the family."
4,"Recommended for the ""History"" Lesson","While not a great film, ""Greased Lightning"" is an entertaining one and provides some insight into an unsung African-American ""barrier-breaker."" Pryor, who never got the film roles deserving of his talent, does a credible job as the main character with support given from Beau Bridges and the always-striking Pam Grier.Also, the film has a special significance for me because I am in the ""crowd"" scenes during one of the pivotal races. Some of the flick's exteriors were filmed at a drag strip not far from my college. So some of my classmates and I jumped at the chance to ""star"" in a movie. You'll have to look fast, but I'm the one with the stupid grin in the crowd.So much for 15 minutes of fame!"
4,good movie,seen movie many years ago. liked it so i bought it. one of my favorite old movies. just wish i bought it on dvd
4,A REALLY SOLID 4 +++,"It's not often I get to see a movie that isn't1) unbelievably complicated in psychological meaning OR2) unbelievably complicated in futuristic technology SOI found it GREAT ENTERTAINMENT, REFRESHING, POSITIVE, ANDmost of all CLEAN, HEALTHY FUN!This is the best I've seen Richard Pryor star in, andthe real life Horatio Alger story is a real force forsuccess motivation, even though I am a WASP.Only the jaded and/or mean spirited would turn this one down."
1,sort of cheating,"This book is exactly the same as ""Handbook of Technical Writing"" by same authors. The only difference is in the cover picture and colors. I think it is not a cool thing to sell the same book with two names without mentioning it. So if you have that one, do not buy this one. They are exactly the same."
2,Great for the grammatically illiterate,"If you have difficulty with grammar or the nuances of words, then read this book. Everything else in this book can be found on reference sites online - citation formating, etc. Don't bother with this book if your grammar is up to par and you're willing to look up official guidelines on citation online. Anyway, the official guidelines change frequently enough that it's better to not rely on an out-of-date paper book. It is important to be literate and always use correct grammar on formal business memos, however you should learn all that in English class in high school. This book was a waste of my time and money."
3,Why do they still sell this?,"I mistakenly bought this edition. Though I'm sure the information hasn't changed terribly much, it's still almost 15 years old and definitely antiquated.With this type of reference material, it's better to stay current."
3,Need for school,"I needed something like this for a college class I was taking. The parts that I needed it for I felt could have been condenced a lot more, it did have what I needed but I thought it should have been laid out better."
1,Haven't received it yet!!!,"I haven't even received my item yet so how am I suppose to review it?? I will never order from here again! It was suppose to be a Christmas present, so much for that! Two weeks late. I really want my money back, but fat chance of that happening. I am sure the product itself will be wonderful but how will I know if I don't have it????"
2,"Alf at last, But With Problems.","Yeah, I'm writing from Portugal. I loved Alf since day 1 too and I love to own in on DVD along other famous series. Unfortunately the sound has echo. We hear what they're about to say before they even say it. Just put it loud and you'll see.Unfortunately I don't know what syndication is but in the end credits there are scenes which don't appear on the episodes.I hope they release McGyver now. :-)))))"
2,Bad Set UP,"My daughter loves all season of the Alf dvd's. However, the Einstein who created all the sets in which you cannot play all of the episodes needs to be fired. I have to literally hit the play button again after each episode. I think this is unheard of on a dvd!"
1,Season One Episode Index,"Is there supposed to be a episode index inside the front cover of the disk case? I just received episode one and there is not one. Episodes 2, 3, and 4 all include a episode index sheet. Feedback Please. Thanks."
1,Edited Versions = Garbage,I bought this when it first came out. I gave it away as gag-gift at xmas. Nuff said.
1,ALF has been butched! Boycott !!,"I was so happy when I saw that ALF finally had been released on DVD, and I orded it immediately without even having read the customer reviews. Huge mistake!Who in their right mind would release a DVD-box leaving out 3-7 minutes from eatch episode?NEVER mind about the hopeless packaging and the rather grainy picture quality (newly remastered??) - it's the more than 100 MINUTES of great ALF-material that are missing that makes me want to burst out in tears.Great job Lions Gate! Thumbs up!Let's boycott these DVDs so that the ORIGINAL ALF-episodes will be released!"
2,What's that?,"Well, I'm here in Germany, waiting and waiting for Alf on DVD - nothing ever happens. So I ordered it from the States and I was very happy, when I hold the box in my Hands, just a few days later. I watched this show for years, know every dialog of it and guess what I was thinking, when I put the first DVD in the Player? They raped it! I'm very disapointed, this is not the show I used to know. In some episodes there are important scences missing. And I'm totally suprised, that most of the customer reviews don't care about it. What is it, with you guys? Is all you need just a hairy puppet with funny jokes? Don't need a story? It's like you're renting a house without any walls. And you say: Oh, no problem. I know walls. I've seen them once on TV. It's OK. At least we have a roof. It's in the garage.Well, after all it's just a TV-Show. But I wont buy the other seasons. You can bet your dead brain on that."
4,Edited? No problem!,"Well, actually somewhat of a problem. But seeing as how I've only seen about 30 episodes of the series, I didn't notice much change. Probably because I watched them on the Hallmark channel, where they probably were cut. Despite the cuts, which lost it a star, this is still the good 'ol Alfer in the 25 episodes (26 broadcast, but ""Try to Remember,"" a double-length episode, is listed as one) of the first season. The animated menus are fantastic, and if you're an ALF fan, edited or otherwise, I advise you get the set. Sure it's a downer. But you shouldn't complain. Just be happy you got ALF on DVD at all. I know I am."
2,ALF DISAPPOINTMENT,"THIS DVD IS EDITED, BADLY. SOME SCENES ARE CUT SO BAD THAT YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON. IN 'COME FLY WITH ME', ALF HIDES OUT IN KATE'S SUITCASE, LEAVING HER CLOTHES AT HOME SO SHE HAS TO BORROW A DRESS FROM MRS.OCMONIK. TREVOR ASKS HER IF SHE NEEDS JUST THE DRESS OR DOES SHE HAVE TO BORROW A BRA, TOO. THIS IS NOT IN ANY SCENE ON DVD. ANOTHER OMISSION IS IN 'THE ROACH'. WILL ASKS THE EXTERMINATOR IF HE DOESN'T HAVE ANOTHER WAY OF GETTING RID OF THE ROACH AND HE REPLIES, 'OH I'M SORRY, I LEFT MY HEAT SEEKING MISSILE IN THE CAR"" WHEN I BUY A, SUPPOSEDLY, INTACT DVD FROM A NETWORK, I EXPECT IT TO CONTAIN ENTIRE SCENES, JUST LIKE IT WAS FIRST TRANSMITTED IN 1986 AND THROUGHOUT THE SERIES RUN. IF SEASON 2 IS EDITED THIS WAY, I WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER SEASON, MUCH AS I LOVE ALF. I HAVE SOME OF THEM ON TAPE FROM THE ORIGINAL BROADCASTS AND I THINK NBC SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO ALL OF US THAT THEY BILKED."
3,Shame on Lions Gate,"It is very sad that Lions Gate released ALF in a syndicated version meaning that there is 4-5 minutes of original programming missing. Also it is sad that there are reviewers who give this 5 stars even though the program is not complete. To illustrate to those misguided 5 star reviewers next time you go to a baseball game stay for only for 7 innings, or next football game stay for only 3 quarters. Or next time you watch your favorite program turn it off with 5 minutes left. I will give you all a dollar, if you will use it to buy a clue."
3,More cut episodes coming!,"Well not only does THIS set have the syndicated episodes, but Lion's Gate announced that they will use the cut-up syndicated versions for season 2 as well. Their reason is that ""the syndicated versions have better picture quality.""0 for 2, Lion's Gate...."
1,I want my money back!!,I can't believe they would use the syndicated/cut episodes to sell on DVD. I have a DVD recorder and I can record my own cut television off of the air. The main reason I buy season sets of TV shows that I love is because they are uncut.
1,Wrong...Wro...Wrooooong!,"The show ""ALF"" is great but this DVD set is not. Why? Two big problems:1. The episodes are edited. An example: In the episode where Willy must build a cage to restrain ALF because he is about to ""go goofy"", the scene in the garage where Trevor cathches Willy building the cage is deleted. Yet in the end credits you see a blurb from that scene.2. Do we REALLY need ALF to give us lessons on how to use the menus of the DVD? This annoying banter is possibly funny the first time but you are subjected to it EVERY time you view the DVD!What a shame. I waited so long for ALF on DVD and get nothing but disappointment. I wish I had kept my complete and unedited video tapes of the show.As ALF would say...""This bites wind""."
1,lions gate entertainment screwed place a complaint with them,LIONS GATE ENTERTAINMENT SCREWED UP WHEN THE PUT THIS DVD SET TOGETHER. NOT ALL OF THE SHOWS PEICES ARE THERE PARTS OF THE SHOWS ARE MISSING. PLEASE CONTACT LIONSGATEFILMS.COM AND PLACE A COMPLAINT THANK YOU. lionsgatefilms.com
1,ALF - Season One,"Product is defective and not the ""good quality"" that the seller portrayed. I would not purchase from this seller again. I did take the time to send the seller an email with no response."
5,ALF DVD IS AWSOME!!,"I just bought the DVD late yesterday and watched it all night! It's absolutely hillarious and the special features are spectacular. ALF's commentary had me rolling and the outtakes reel also has some great, behind-the-scenes features. This DVD is a must buy!!"
4,Alf 1,We laughed the whole way through the dvds. My daughter that is age 5 even liked them. It was a great family movie day. ALF was never bad for children.
2,need a lot of work...,"It was diappointing to learn that these are the stripped down versions, as many other people are pointing out. Also, what I would consider a necessary feature is missing from this DVD set: play all. Especially with these chopped up eps, do you want to go back and click play every 21 minutes? Any TV show should have a play all feature so that you can just watch all the eps on the DVD straight through without interruption (gold stars to the first tv series that only plays the theme song at the beginning of the first ep on each disc during a play all). In Living Color has it and School House Rock even has two versions: straight through or shuffle. The other bonus materials are fun, but do not at all compensate for the lacking content and playall feature :(If you really really must have it, then enjoy... but if you're unsure or devout, you'll be disappointed and annoyed."
3,please read this before you buy it !!!,"when the edited one episode call ""wild thing"" they cut two minutes from the show. I dont know if was a mistake when they edit the dvd, or they did on purpose. The scene they cut out is when willie is in the garage, building the cage for alf. they cut the scene all together. if any body knows of any other mistakes on the dvd, or if the they are going to correct it or let me know.thanks"
2,lions gate screwed up!,"I bought the first season of ALF and am very disappointed in the structure of the show. I have the originals on vhs and there are parts on the vhs tapes that do not appear on the DVD set, so that sucks. Lions Gate should be ashamed of what they call the first season of ALF. I am amazed that the person who played Alf is actually allowing himself to be part of this pitiful excuse of a DVD collection. I myself will not be purchasing the next seasons of ALF without a lot of thought going into it first."
1,HAHAHA,"if you are seriouslt considering buying this--well......then....just dont. Think about it....its Alf....let this show die......what a horrid, horrid...and now dated show."
4,It's not bad at all,"So many people thinks that it's a bad dvd, it's NOT. I mean it's ALF. I still crack up everytime I watch it. Could it be better, maybe. However it's still ALF Hope seasons 3-4 come soon. I love ALF."
4,"Good to see Alf again, stupid FBI nonsense","Nice to see Alf again. A bit of a pity that some episodes were cut, though.Oh, and thanks for the ""FBI Warnings"" (legal nonsense, waste of time) - one star gone - ho ho ho"
3,Incredible,"UNfortunately, it' usual for this late 70/80 TV shows to be released in DVD format with a minimun of care and love by the company which own the rights. ALF - Season One is another of thoses cases. The extras (or lack of) are a joke. And the ultimate sin is to release the syndicated versions... Man, what were they thinking?!!"
4,a little edited But still good ol' Alf,"this DVD is very good, Some complain like they cut the whole show out, NAH, I mean why complain, can't anybody nowadays just be happy, the quality on the episodes are great, and the introduction by alf on all the dvds is cool, also he tells you about each episode too. So dont complain about cuts or edits, cause everything gets that no matter what, TV shows, Movies, even Comercials, so i say if you like ALF get this DVD, youll be glad ya did."
4,ONE OF THE BEST SITCOMS,THIS IS A MUST OWN DVDTHE SITCOM IS ABOUT A ALIEN WHO LANDS ON A FAMILY GARAGE ROOF AND ENDS UP LIVING WITH THEM THE ALIEN NAME IS ALF AND HE IS VERY FUNNY FROM ALL THE CRAZY THINGS HE GETS INTO AND ALWAYS WANTING TO EAT THE FAMILY CAT IF YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS SITCOM YOU MUST BUY IT AND IF YOU DON'T STILL BUY IT IT IS VERY FUNNY
5,alf the alien,this is 6 out of 5 stars. there was only 4 seasons that they have made. Alf is suppose to be the last one from his home planet. good for kids. you will laugh from start to finish.
3,play all feature,"I recently purchased this dvd to introduce my children to ALF and aside from being the short edited versions the dvd does not include a play all, feature i found this to be very bothersome restarting every 22 mins i have purchased many series lately and this is the only one that does not offer that option ,WHY NOT ?"
1,I WILL NOT PAY FOR CUT EPISODES.,"SO I HAVE TO FORK OVER BIG BUCKS to get all the seasons of Alf THAT ARE CUT? YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME. Thanks for the warning, I WILL NOT BUY!!!!!"
1,The DVD contains EDITED versions! Boo Hiss Boo Hiss,"I'd love to give the DVD set a good review, as the show is funny. However, in an outrageous and unacceptable move, the studio has released EDITED, CUT versions of the series, made for syndication. When I go out and BUY a TV series on DVD, I do not expect edited junk, I can see that on cable stations.BOO! HISS! AVOID THIS DVD! Write the studio and tell them you will not sit still for this. Save your money and record the edited versions from TV reruns yourself. Glad I have the uncut network versions from NBC."
3,This absolutely NEEDS to be re-released properly!! PLEASE!!,"Let me just add my voice to the outcry of disappointment over the release of the edited, syndicated versions of the episodes rather than the originals. Don't they know that people who buy DVDs want and expect the definitive, uncut version? This is just unacceptable! I implore Lions Gate (or whoever else might have the ability to do so) to re-release the season one set with the original versions, and not to use that horrible, overlapping disc configuration in the case. What a bad idea!! Please... DO THE RIGHT THING AND RE-ISSUE!!!"
1,Beware - hacked up episodes,"Love the show, but hate this DVD set. I can only hope Lion's Gate revisits this show on HD-DVD and does it right, with UNCUT episodes. Until I get whole episodes, I won't buy them."
1,Episodes are the Cut-Up Syndicated Version,"If you're buying this DVD box set, thinking the episodes are uncut, you will be disappointed, they aren't, they are the Cut-Up Syndicated Version, missing about 3 min. per episodes."
3,"GREAT SHOW, EDITED VERION A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT","As Many people already have mentioned editing Alf shows to fit them on 4 DVD is unacceptable. If they had to take anything out, they should have taken out those Extras(gag Reeels etc) and the Un-aired version of Pilot. I would preffer orignal Uncut Episodes with no extras, over this ridiculous edited version with extras."
3,Good news!,"I agree 100% with the many reviews here that denounce the mutilation that Lions Gate performed on the episodes. It's ashame! But there is good news for us. Season One has just been released in Brazil by Warner in its fullness! UNCUT! And theyship it to the US. The address of the store is:[...].Soon they'll be releasing the other seasons, I was told."
4,Good but line cutter gets in the way,This knife is good and light. The only problem is that the line cutter kind of sticks out and catches on things easily. But its still good value for its price.
4,Interesting Start to a Series!,"In the mood for another serial killer series, I decided to give this first novel in a two-book series a try. Set in Las Vegas, Bernhardt couples this interesting setting with an odd, Edgar Allan Poe angle as each murder adds to the killer's strange goal. Susan Pulaski, the main character, is a deeply flawed woman, but Bernhardt manages to make her quite sympathetic and even likable. The aid from her autistic friend adds originality to the genre, and makes the book a lot more interesting (and also makes Susan a lot more endearing). The shifting points of view detracted from the novel, here, unfortunately, and as a whole, the book was rather out of the realm of realism. Still, those things aside, on the whole it was an enjoyable and entertaining mystery and I must say that I am looking forward to the sequel!"
2,Dark Eye is a Formula Book,"I've read and liked Bernhardt before, but IMO this one is a real stinker and not worthy of his talents. The heroine ? is not a bit likeable, in fact I found her disgusting in more ways than one. She did not act like a professional, yelling and talking when she should have not spoken. Also, why is Patrick in this? We're led to believe he is a better profiler (more experienced since he wrote the book) and yet he seems to be there for her to gawk at and to supply a love interest. Like one of the others who commented I am still hanging in there since I want to see how much worse it can get. Mr. Bernhardt, please don' t do any more serial killers; it just is not your genre. BTW, Capitol Murder was another one where the author seemed to enjoy writing like a Romance novelist, with the ridiculous sex being over the top. Grrr."
1,Silly and unrealistic,Luckily this book came from the library. Don't waste your money on such a sorry attempt. No police psychologist could ever be so stupid and self-centered and still have a job. Clues ignored all over the place except when Darcy wanders into the mix.
2,Please bring back Ben Kincaid,"Susan Pulaski is really screwed up. She just lost her husband and the Las Vegas police force just gave her a pink slip - not to mention a trip to detox.While combatting her addiction, she meets a female autistic savant who basically helps her enter the mind of a serial killer.Premise sounds good. Actual story is not. I feel as though the writing is incredibly controlled and the whole plot just does not flow for me. The main character is kind of on a constant whine and basically, this whole plot just does not work.It is incredibly difficult for me to write this as I am a HUGE Ben Kincaid fan. Its hard for me to believe that the man who writes Kincaid also wrote this.Please stick to writing Ben Kincaid more often and these ""out of series"" books never."
3,Expected more!,Was excited to read something that was about the lawyer and his crew. This was a disappointment. He needs to spice up his books.
5,Truly gorgeous.,"Along with Madderlake's ""Flowers Rediscovered"", this is one of my favourite book of floral art. The photography is gorgeous and many of the designs are eminently do-able. I wish the vase suppliers were acknowledged individually...........I'm desparate to find the multi-opening vase on page 14."
3,hmmm,"I could not find a system in the way this DVD was built up.They show all kinds of people with different averages (125-220) they watch them bowl, they give them advices then they watch them again. Most of them are doing the same thing after what they did before. I'm a beginner so it may be me but I would expect more for 30 bucks."
1,I Could Learn More Watching Snails Mate...,"This was a total waste of money. It went through bowlers who didn't have anything in common with my style or problem. For the most part it only discussed straightening one's ball out for spares from 125 up through 200+ average bowlers. I am so shocked that this is all Walter Ray could produce considering that he is one of the most acurate bowlers on the tour. Showed nothing on release, correcting turning early, release point, grip, etc.; real problems of real bowlers... I watched this DVD once and shredded it. Total waste of time waiting and my money. I don't mean to be harsh; I'm just being honest. I'm only one spare or strike away from averaging 200 and trying to work on my consistency and I couldn't get a thing from this DVD.Hands down, I'd refer anyone to Norm Duke's video. Watched it and went to the bowling alley and incorporated his corrective techniques instantly. My average is sure to go up soon..."
3,Very Tiny Earrings,"These bear fetish earring are nice but extremely small, really much more appropriate for a child than an adult. On an adult it is very difficult to see them because they are so small, even with a short haircut."
3,"Like the characters, the ending ... meh!","After reading other Hawks Way books, this one was a disappointment. Putting aside the whole 'why would you marry a man who doesn't love you' question (there is an answer that, while not entirely satisfying, worked), the way the romance unfolded just felt contrived. The trip to the fertility specialist was poorly researched. The rationale why HE wanted a loveless marriage ... okay ... the dude got burned badly (I won't spoil it for you).The 'tragedy' before the end just totally didn't work for me. He could have loved and accepted her without it (after all ... nearly a year of trying nightly and not succeeding ... the tragedy was just contrived) and adopted the little girl. It's too bad the plot just plain did not work because the characters themselves were intriguing. It was the situation they found themselves in that just plain was not credible."
4,Kids love this book,Bought this book for my nephew for Christmas. He loves it. I bought it last year for my kids but it's been destroyed. Be careful with the Disney books. It seems they don't have a very strong spine so when kids open up the books a little too wide where it bends back just a little all the pages start to come out. We have only had this problem with a very few books but at least 2 of them were Disney.
5,So useful!!!!,This is the best book for toddlers starting on words. The pictures are very nice and the hide and seek game in each page is sure to have your toddler captivated. An Excellent Buy!
5,Provides hours of reading,"I bought this book for my daughter 2 months ago when she was 15 months. It is a book that she would pick out to read almost everyday, and at times, she could spend up to half an hour just flipping through the pages. I have bought other similar books by Richard Scarry and First 1000 Words, but they simply don't hold her interest as much. The drawings in Disney 1000 Words are big and clear, while I find some other books a bit too cramped and the objects too small. Highly recommended!"
5,Understanding Asian Indian Americans,This is a very good book to understand lhe new wave of immigation from India. She puts forth a balanced and understandable view of the new immigrations.A sympahetic ooutstanding unbiasedd accoount
4,"Good, not great","This vice as shipped is different than the one shown on the web site as the method of attaching the upper cross slide screw is changed. Not a big deal, but not what I was expecting. The vice itself is serviceable, with a fairly smooth action and not very much back lash. The base is not tall enough for the lower cross slide handle to clear, so it must be mounted up on another sub-base to function, which was easily done, but inconvenient. Still, it's a pretty good value considering the price."
5,Brum is a hit in my house,"I don't know why, but Brum is very popular with my almost-4 and almost-5 year olds. What with all the Pixar and Disney movies out there, I didn't think they would care too much for Brum the day we put it on for them (it's available for streaming on Netflix, if you want to preview--though not the episodes on this DVD), but they loved it! When my son opened this on Christmas morning, he said, ""Brum soccer! Oh, yeah!""Definitely a good purchase. It's nice not to have to patrol language like you have to do in movies like Toy Story, etc, and remind kids that it's not ok to call someone ""stupid,"" or an ""idiot,"" even though Woody just called Buzz Lightyear that very name for the umpteenth time."
4,Still holds up almost thirty years later,"This album was obviously thrown together in 1967 to maximize the financial return from the mega hit ""San Francisco"". The fact that it is solid thruout was a huge surprise to me in the 60's and it still holds up today. His voice really fits the Tim Hardin songs, the John Phillips songs are well done, and his original song ""What's the difference"" is excellent.If you like the song ""San Francisco"" you should love this album. I recommend it to any ex-hippy or ex-hippy wannabes."
3,Good Voice,"I bought this album for the title song, and found the rest of the songs on this album pleasant, but not comparable in any way, to ""San Francisco"". I do feel it is still a worthwhile purchase. Maybe in time, the other tunes will grow on me."
4,Scott McKenzie CD,"I am glad to have my own copy of Scott McKenzie's ""San Francisco"", one of my favorite songs from the '60's. The quality is great and I received it very quickly after I placed my order."
3,MT1Fig's review,"K-Tel Presents: Doo Wop ClassicsThis CD is a collection of popular and lesser known Doo Wop recordings. Classics include: At my front door(crazy little mama), Sixty minute man, and Fifty million women. The seller sent the CD right away and was in mint condition (shrink wrapped). The El Dorados recording of ""At my front door"" did not seem to be of studio quality, though I have heard better quality recordings elsewhere."
5,one of my all time favorite books when i was a kid,"i LOVED the Serendipity Books when i was a child and this was by far my favorite, i remember making my parents read it to me every night before bed. the fact that i lived in Washington state probably had something to do with it ... i remember laying in bed after hearing the story and looking out my window and trying to find the light on the top of the Space Needle ... the fact that i lived on the other side of the Cascade mountains, no where near Seattle didnt faze me a bit. 20 some years later i still remember loving this book."
5,That little flashing light lives on,"This is such a wonderful story. I have never forgotten it! for over 30 years now i still look at that little red flashing light and think of the wheedle. I passed this onto my son who loved it. I find it so cute to see him leaning over in the back seat, telling his 4 year old sister about the wheedle living up."
5,Must have for PNW kids,"Grew up with this book and still love it. Now my kiddo loves it too. Cute, whimsical and charming. An essential for Pacific Northwest kids"
1,Mistakes!!!!,"Well, I have not read this book yet. I was thinking of buying it but I saw two crucial mistakes on this site alone. The map of Pakistan shown on the back cover is wrong, Kashmir is shown as part of India which is absolutely wrong. Kashmir is an internationally recognized disputed area according to UN. one-third of Kashmir is under Pakistani control and even it is shown under Indian map. Second, the historic Badshahi Mosque in Lahore is called the Lahore fort. To me, these two mistakes in only a few pages shown on this site is a big turn-off, so I'm skeptical of the research and knowledge of the authors."
2,A big disappointment,"I already have a radio but I bought this for two purposes (1) to pick up my NPR station clearly. For some reason, it comes in perfectly on my car radio, but poorly on my hi-fi and on my regular radios it is competely swamped by a nearby country station. I figured this radio would be able to separate the stations. (2) to discover new stations on shortwave.It failed to do either, despite much experimentation with the antenna and external antenna. The FM NPR station is completely swamped by the country music station - feeble, considering I can hear it perfectly in my car in my garage, and this radio is on the 3rd floor of a house sitting high on a hill. As for the shortwave, I only picked up a couple of stations. Other annoyance: cannot listen to the stations as you tune it, as you would be able to with analog tuning. On a huge band like SW, this is very frustrating. I expected more considering these reviews and the price."
2,poor am reception,"THE SANGEAN ats-606AP waas generally a well built item. The FM reception was good. But the AM reception was poor, it could not pull in stations from only 10 miles away. I would not buy this radio again."
4,Real Good Radio,"I've been a Short Wave Listener since 1973 and a licensed Ham since 1991 and I have never owned a receiver that can match the performance of this one! The main high point for me is the sensitivity. This little gem, with it's short telescoping whip really brings in the HF signals. It performs like other receivers connected to long-wire or random-wire external antennas. Another point is the ease of operation. The control buttons are straight-forward, with minimal use of ""dual-function"" controls. It has direct-frequncy entry, as well as ""up - down"" tuning/ scanning functions. One feature I would like to see, however, would be a BFO for reception of single sideband communications.I'm generally not a fan of small radios, but the performance of this one (especially for the price) makes it a welcome addition to my other equipment. I highly recommend this one!"
4,A Smorgassboard for many Palattes,"This book contains a delectable selection of short stories by Australian and New Zealand authors who incorporate food into their themes. The selection is varied, yet the collection as a whole has a unity not often achieved in collections ... it reads like a good cookbook, with recipes for every occasion. The experience of reading the stories together is dream-like ... the feeling one gets after a very big meal!"
2,"Don't expect Johnny Hiland, Albert Lee or Brent Mason's style of ""Chicken Rippin' ""","If you are a guitar picker looking for a lesson, Redd can give you one in class and taste. However, if you are looking for the speed and inspiration that Hiland, Lee, and Mason bring this album will be disapointing to you. The musicianship and sound quality of the recording is second to none but the album is completely lifeless and will not hold your attention. The instrumental tracks are virtually ""backing tracks"" that will have you waiting for a solo or something that shows a flicker of life which never comes. The songs with lyrics are just plain corny, and not in a good Junior Brown kind of way. The highlight of the album is definetly the steel guitar playing of Jim Murphy. If you want some kick a** tele pickin' pick up some of the above players I've mentioned, they'll blow you're mind. Some Danny Gatton and Jerry Reed would do you good too!"
2,Advice,"Don't bother learning *the tricks of the trade* -- learn the trade. In this case, the trade is playing music on a guitar, and its not just a series of tricks. With this sort of attitude and say, ten years, you'll have 10 years experience being a first-year wannabe. Music is made from Melody, Harmony, Rhythm... so, do the work: learn Music, not tricks about music."
3,"Good for reading, not for camp fires.","I purchased this book to be part of my 'campfire story collection' when on Boy Scout campouts. I was looking for something that was 'scary, but not too scary', with longer and more compelling stories than many of the 100-words or less entrants that seem to fill some books (I mean, give us a little bit of a story...)In any case, while some of them can be interesting to read on their own and for insight into what people thought was scary 100+ years ago (hint, almost nothing of it is currently scary to your average 12-13 year-old, and mostly they're just confused because of the vintage vocabulary), it's probably not the book I would reach for to take on the next campout. Perhaps (if you were a better story teller than I am) you could learn the stories and then re-tell them in your own words. Perhaps then this book would be useful for source material. Until then I would go with a different option."
3,Michael McDonald and Friends,"PBS' Soundstage was revived in 2003 as a forum for presenting some of today's most important artists in intimate live settings. As an idea its a good one but in practice the recreation of a live performance for a television show has some limitations especially in the area of timing and editing.Michael McDonald's performance in support of his Motown album is quite a good one all things considered. He plays 12 songs in a set that lasts a little under an hour and gets good performances from his guests Ashford and Simpson, Pat Simmons and Ton Johnson of the Doobie Brothers. Highlights include I Heard it Through The Grapevine, Ain't No Mountain High Enough and his own later solo and Doobie Brothers work.All in all this is not a bad set but it is a little constrained by its format. The disc includes some textual special features and a two song preview of another Soundstage episode featuring Chicago."
3,Where is the sound ?,"Being a huge fan since Michael Mc Donald joined the Doobie Brothers i am alwawys looking for new DVD or CD.I already got Gathering of Friends which is too short but sounding great.This is not the case with that one compared to lastest DVD concert i baught(Phil Collins, Eagles farewell tour, Peter Gabriel etc....)I am waiting for the next one.Pascal PEDROSA (Fontaine la Mallet-France)"
2,Better next time !,"Love the guy for his great voice. But the DVD ""Gathering of friends"" is .. much much better !"
5,this took me back,"this is great of course michale is still sexy, tom johnston oh my god does he look sharp the music is first rate also i had a crush on a boy at school when what a fool belives was out i was a freshman it was one of those throwing papper wads at each other things and i acted like i hated him he would try and help me with my math and i was to shy and scared i run into him once in a while now and these songs are the back drop to that special time in my life by the way i still have a crush on michale"
3,"Great songs, poor sound quality","Being a big fan of Michael McDonald, I could hardly wait to play the DVD when it arrived. I love the selection of songs, but the sound quality leaves a lot to be desired. When I compare this the other music DVDs I own, such as The Eagles Farewell I Tour, the sound quality is definitely inferior. It sounds like someone simply held up a microphone from a distance and recorded it. I guess I'll stick to CDs if I want to listen to Michael."
3,michael mcdonald timeless talent and blue eyed soul,I am a long time fan of Michael Mcdonald. I love his new material but still long for some of the early recordings especially if on DVD. this one is fair but not for me his best dvd
1,Buy This and You Will Go Wrong!,"Terrible sound quality! This CD was made in conjunction with Sony Music Special Products and yet their usual quality is nowhere to be found. The liner notes by Scott Yanow are filled with biographic inaccuracies, wrong recording dates and musician/soloist info, and even misspells the name of Kemp's vocalist Maxine Gray throughout. The digital restoration is credited to Ken Robertson who has done better on other similar titles. The main problem with the sound quality is that there is too much hiss, too much crackle, and the music sounds lifeless. I have the original 78rpm Brunswick records of all these tracks, and in all cases they sound much better than the ""remastered"" tracks on this cd. There have been numerous advances in sound restoration techniques during these past 10 years and yet listening to this CD you'd think we've taken a few steps back instead! Save your money and skip this one!"
5,belief,"quirky. endearing. kind.a blurb on the cover of the book compared it to a gothic horror novel. that comparison coupled with the description on the back of the book intrigued me to say the least.i began to read skeptically, wondering what kind of story this would turn out to be. my skepticism wore off quickly, though, as i was drawn into the lives of the strange inhabitants of the observatory mansions. little by little more is revealed about the residents until their oddities become almost just like your oddities. almost.this is one of the most creative stories i have read in a long time. i think that the strangeness of the story and the somewhat odd way of telling it, while i found it intriguing and endearing, may put some readers off.carey captures the homebody in the most vivid of ways in this book. after reading it, people will seem more and less strange to your eyes which have been filled with the tragedies of all the residents of observatory mansions."
4,A strangely compelling book,"Although it took me a little while to fall into the rhythm of Carey's somewhat stylized prose, I was glad I stuck with it. By the end of the book, I was completely engrossed by the strange, sad, surreal world of Observatory Mansions. It is so difficult to pull off a narrator with as many flaws and unfavorable qualities as Francis Orme, the protagonist of this tale, but Carey does it, and it is a refreshing and exhilarating thing to read a story from such a unique perspective."
4,Visit the Mansions,"I wanted to curl back up into this book for days after finishing it. The self-contained world Edward Carey creates is so crooked, dusty and credible. One trusts completely what the characters see and experience because one is being guided so kindly by the hand. Think twice the next time you sit next to a myopic albino on the bus; chances are they have a far richer inner life than we tidy commuters."
5,swirling vortex,"I was drawn into this novel completely unaware that I would experience the stillness of Thomas Francis as the dark strange world of Observatory Mansions was meticulously constructed around me. I was not comfortable or enjoying myself as much as I was totally engrossed, facinated. This novel is not one that I could pick up and put down, reading a little here and there. I had to read on, start to finish. The only pause taken was as I wondered who, besides the author, would direct this novel when it becomes a film.Initially I could only imagine Tim Burton as the director, then as the book progressed I vascillated between Wes Anderson and Tim Burton...."
5,Great book,Such an original book! I think most of the reviews have already summed it up.... buy this. You wont be dissapointed.
5,"A devoted man who loves God, his wife and his country.","The author never gave up and was more concerned about others and their welfare than he was for himself. His main goal was to return to the loving arms of his beautiful wife. I didn't want to put the book down until I finished it. Mr. Robinson conveyed a wonderful picture of what patriotism means and being devoted to his one true love... his beautiful, loving, sweet wife."
3,Not their best,"Released in 1989, No Remorse was the 5th album from the British hard rock band Tokyo Blade. I hate to say it, but this is definitely not the band's best work. No Remorse sounds like a halfhearted cross between Ozzy Osbourne and TNT. There are a couple of straightforward metal tracks (Shadows of Insanity, the Eye of the Storm), a sappy ballad or two (Call Me Angel, Chains of Love), and a few that go for the L.A. sleaze rock sound (5-Inch Catwalk, Fever). The result is a completely adequate, yet completely forgettable hard rock album from a band that was capable of much more. This is just like what Shy released with theirMisspent Youthalbum.Unless you're trying to complete a Tokyo Blade collection, you may want to skip No Remorse."
2,Not terribly helpful,"I was very excited to get this book as we plan to incorporate some craftsman style elements into the 1970s bungalo we're buying. The interiors in the photos were not terribly attractive and leaned towards kitschy. Unless you want to turn you house into a museum to 20th century cheasiness, don't buy this book."
5,Its a keeper!,"As a librarian and a lover of Arts & Crafts style, I recommend this book to all who desire a peek at some fantastic Bungalow interiors. The color photography is stunning and that material which is covered is covered well. Though the pictures will be enticing to anyone fond of this architecture, I consider the text to be aimed at newbies. Having said that, the chapter on ""What Style is Your Home"" describing basic architectural hallmarks of various Bungalows is especially well written, albeit very basic.At merely 186 pages, there are five chapters that lighly cover everything from Bungalow architecture to woodwork and interior details. There are even chapters that deal with making a Bungalow livable in the modern world (""Finding and Creating Space"" & ""Today's Classic Interior"")Whether you are seeking a coffee table book of beautiful photographs or are just beginning to research this topic, I highly recommend this book."
4,"Beautiful pictures, workable ideas","So you've bought a bungalow--now, what do you do with it? Maybe it's a fixer-upper; maybe it's too small, or doesn't have enough storage space; maybe you're just not sure what kind of furniture to get. This book is a great start toward deciding where to go next. Illustrated with hundreds of full-color photographs, it shows not only many of the features by which you can tell an Arts & Crafts house when you see it (I was surprised to learn that the big old foursquares such as my grandparents lived in for 40 years are included in this classification), but gives actual ideas carried out by other homeowners, even unto before-and-after floor plans. The author's advice is thoughtful and well suited to the houses she writes about, too. And if you just like to look at pictures of vintage American homes, this would be a good volume to add to your collection."
4,Wow!,"This book is wonderfully Dangerous. Meaning: My wife and I just bought a new house (new to us, but built in 1920) and my local Home depot is going to be thrilled that I got this book, and want to thank the author. This book has given me enough ideas to almost single handedly keep the economy going. Oh, Curse you Good BooK!"
5,Great Idea Book,"If you are planning any kind work where you are going using allot of wood this is a great book, it is full of ideas. The photos have great detail. One of best books I have on Craftsman/Arts& Crafts interiors."
2,If you like table settings,"Lots of table settings, many are just multiple views of the same. Very bland style. Their catalogs are just as good as this book. I was disappointed in this one."
3,Wider variety of ideas needed,"I loved the Pottery Barn book called ""HOME"", and thought this one would be as good. Unfortunately, this book lacked a variety of ideas, (when it comes to setting a table for parties and such)."
1,BROKEN COVER,The book's paper cover arrived home broken. I hope to get help from your team to replace it.GOD BLESS
3,Workmanlike,"I don't grade on a curve and give every book a 5 start rating.The author says that Bumper Crop means the overage from a good crop. These stories basically did not make the author's cut for a previous collection. That explaination nails the collection right on. They are fine stories, with a bit of a low rent Lovecraft feel to more than a few of them. I used the book for bedside reading but it would work as travel reading just as well. I read and enjoyed one of the author's Texas buddy tales and decided to try his horror stories. As I say this isn't memorable but it's a good read."
2,porC repmuB,"I borrowed this book from a guy I used to work with...well, forever ago. He assured me that I would love it, because he knew how much I enjoyed horror stories. I took it home and, on glancing at it, was actually pleasantly surprised to see something familiar on the list of short stories: one of the tales had actually been published in this INCREDIBLY age-inappropriate book I read in 4th grade. That put me in a good mood, because I had fond memories of the piece in question just scaring the crap out of me.Annnnnd then I started to read the rest.Frankly, the author seems very...well, full of himself. He goes for shock in the way of Carlton-How-Is-This-Guy-Seriously-A-Published-Author Mellick III. The God of the Razor in particular was just absolutely, absolutely awful. His writing style leaves much to be desired, and I never really walked away from any one of these stories -- even that old favorite -- particularly satisfied or wanting more.Not worth the buy. Not even a little."
2,Disappointed,"After reading some of the glowing reviews for this books I was somewhat amazed at the low quality of the writing. The stories are, for the most part, poorly crafted and sophmoric. A few shine feebly but mostly I'de like my money and time back. The author introduces each tale with a story about its genesis. From reading most of the introiductions I have gotten the sense that a) he is his own biggest fan, b) he wants to remind everyone every 10 pages that he has met T.E.D. Klein and c) he has read some Bradybury in his day.As no novice in the field of literature (horror, mystery and fantasy) I can assure you that, as a whole, this rates as one of the poorest anthologies I have ever picked up. Run away, and quickly, and buy yourself some M.R. James, Kim Newman or Lovecraft."
2,Meh - not a fan,"I got this to try to get introduced into the world of the Weird West and Joe Lansdale who is right now one of the big names of the genre - this set of stories is mostly horror based and not too many have a western influence in them - I actually do not remember any having a western flair - even the one story about Western Cowboys takes place on an airport shuttle and lasts for 4 pages - this is not a good read for Weird Western, but it is if you are in the mood for horror short stories - which I am not a fan of nor did I want to become a fan of them - 2 stars is because it was disappointing and some of the stories were flat out stupid to me - but this is only my opinion - others may like Lansdale's work"
3,like the mozart effect?,"Using Wenger's own technique this book purports to show you a technique that will increase your measureable IQ by 1 point for each hour of useage. Sounds like the study that found music by Mozart could increase the IQ...and is now in question again.This, as far as I can see, is based on just the one study - no follow up, no other studies have been done. So perhaps it does work but if so I would really have expected more reports of increased intelleigence among adherents.The gist of the technique is visualisation with verbal commentary to a friend or recorded...doing so apparently increases brain connections and hence the increased intelligence. Mr Wenger doesn't seem to be pushing for further study so I really wonder if he's happy with the one report and would prefer not to see any other evidence."
1,This book is overly simplistic.,This book is about 100 pages too long for the amount of information presented. I was disappointed.
4,A Beginning Watercolor Painter's Best Friend,"As a beginning watercolor painter (6 months), I find this book to be tremendously helpful when I embark on new subjects. The close up views, particularly the animal fur and tree bark textures, are great!"
1,Very disappointing,"I was very excited when I read the title for this book and ordered it. Upon its arrival I read through the whole thing in about 20 minutes and was very disappointed. Her ""tips"" for texture techniques will work only if you are what I would call a very loose artist with no desire for detail or realism. Most of her examples look like she used a set of crayolas to paint them. I would not recommend this book to anyone except maybe an absolute beginner."
4,A great addition to an art library,This book has some great ideas and techniques. I can't wait to try some out on my watercolor paintings.
3,Indifferent,"I found this album,although very generous with 24 tracks,a bit disappointing.There are really no standout songs on it & one song seemingly merges into the next one, almost indistinguishable from one another.Timi Yuro's voice is as powerful as ever,but the choice of tunes is too much of the same.I mean no disrespect but in my view it just does not compare to 'The Best Of Timi Yuro',where every song is a huge hit."
5,A remarkable true story,"An Ordinary Soldier is the inspirational memoir of Charles William Gebhardt, who served in the 7th Infantry Division of the 17th Infantry Regiment, whose duties took them from the Aleutians to the Marshall Islands to the Philippines. He encountered life-threatening battles and during the course of World War II, yet also forged enduring friendships. Written by Gebhardt's nephew, An Ordinary Soldier follows his service from his difficult childhood and the rigors of boot camp into the true hell of combat. He would belong to the group that wore the symbol and shared the nickname of the ""Hourglass"". A remarkable true story that brings the Pacific Theater experience to vivid life, and a welcome contribution to military history and biography shelves."
5,KATELAND,"HOW GOOD IS THIS...Its fantastic. I stayed up late into the night watching this. Couldnt drag myself away from it. They go right into these crimes, you see the suspects in the police station rooms been interviewed by the detectives. Some are released when the police are satisfied that this person was not involved in the Murder. The first 48 hours is the most important time for the police, they must try and get there man. After that the case begins to go COLD. I got to know these group of men and women detectives very well, and even felt they were my friends. I saw them at play. I watched them laughing and jokeing. And i saw the very serious side of them too. When they are called out to gruesome murders. The long hours that they are required to put in, stoping at a diner just for a quick eat, then its back on the road again. A great 2 disc series. One you could watch again, AND AGAIN."
5,The First 48 rocks,"If you like investigative shows, you'll like The First 48 series. I miss then Sgt. Joe, now Lieutenant Joseph Schillaci. He was always an interesting character to follow. Miami, Memphis and Dallas shows rock.Especially Caroline Mason. I love this show."
3,Long shipment,This item took almost a month to reach me. I received my other items over 2 weeks ago before I received this item. It's ok - as long as I got it!
3,"A Show About ""Black-on-Black"" Homicides","I'm just curious about something. I have watched several episodes so far and all I'm seeing are ""black-on-black"" crimes. A foreigner watching this show would get the mistaken impression that all crimes committed in this country are committed by blacks. Where are the murders committed by whites on whites? Are they not shown because whites can afford high-powered legal talent so they ""lawyer up"" immediately thus making it difficult to extract a confession? The other thing I've noticed is that sweating confessions from suspects appears to be the only way cops can resolve a case. Check out the high fives when a perp is caught on videotape confessing to a murder. What happened to good old forensic ""CSI"" work? Or is the CBS hit drama just selling us an overblown fantasy?"
1,Worth Zero Stars,"Read this book real careful and check out the facts for yourself. I've heard this writer say stuff in the classroom like the epidemics that killed off so many Indians were an accident because the Indians didn't have immunities, and that there was no jenocide of Indians by white people. I don't know if what's in his book is impartial. I also thought the writing was real hard to get into. I couldn't even get finished with the book."
1,Extremely poor design!,"Overnight rain pooled in canopy and collapsed the entire frame beyond repair. Warranty states, ""This warranty applies only for normal and expected uses, as determined by the manufacturer."" Important Information states, ""Do not use in any potentially windy or rainy weather."" Care and Maintenance states, ""Use a seam sealer if top leaks or drips water."" Why would they tell me that if I'm not supposed to use it in rainy weather?We will NEVER again purchase any product from E-Z Up!"
3,Buy this only for the doll. The rest doesn't work properly.,"I bought the whole collection. None of the stuff works. So if you buy it, buy it for the doll only."
5,Excellent music! I rate a 100 star I have all your albums!,"I am a big fan of Sarah Mclachlan's. Me and my friend love the music! The Lilith Fair was great! Keep goin'.Good luck on other albums,(hopefully there will be other albums)!"
1,A Waste,"Pure schlock, this is one of the worst, if not THE worst CD of all time. Even Milli Vanilli had more talent. Don;t waste your hard earned money on this garbage."
3,"Great for Sandwhiches, Not for Panini Presses","I purchased this book when I got my Cuisinart Griddler. This book has great ideas for sandwiches, bruschetta and crostini, but as a previous reviewer noted, not many of the sandwhich recipes are for a panini press. Now you can certainly press each of the recipes if you want, but clearly that is not what the author intended.If you are lookging for a panini press book, this book could be a starting point, just change some of the breads and press away. I wouldn't recommend it for someone who is looking for a true panini press cookbook."
1,Not what I expected,This recipe book was recommended with the panini grill - but it has very few grilled recipes. Not what I expected at all.
2,"Disliked it so much, I returned it","Unlike the above reviews, I didn't like this book. I am from the NYM area and love panini sandwiches, but this book's recipes bordered on the ridiculus with a tremendous repeat of ingredients, used over and over again. The recipes seemed hardly original to me. My local delis have a much more interesting assortment of ingredients than any recipe in this book. A let down, as I was really looking forward to this book."
3,Not a good italian panini cook book,This book is not quite what I thought it was going to be. If you are interested in more dinner/lunch panini (italian) sandwich type cookbooks look elsewhere.
1,Simply put: I'm returning it,"This book was incredibly disappointing. Not ONE recipe in it looked worth-while. After reading the reviews of all the books, this one seemed to have the most positive response. But I wasn't impressed at all. In fact, I think I realized that the trick to a good panini is simply coming up with your own creations. You don't really need recipes to tell you how to make a good panini. Don't waste your time with this one."
2,More recipes wouldn't hurt.,A well compiled booklet because thats exactly the feel of the paperback version. The recipes are rustic and easy.
2,Not enough,By the name you would expect this book to give you some of those restaurant recipes from your favorite italian sandwich shop of the East coast area. But there is no bread recipes at all. Only to buy those made by your local bakery. There are some very good filling recipes though.
5,Awesome appliance,"I love this product and use it several times a week. Whoever suggested getting a paninni machine with flat cooking surfaces was right. You can do so many more things. Imagine french toast done perfectly with no flipping. Reheats pizza, rolls etc perfectally - and makes awesome sandwiches. No fat necessary for use."
3,Not so many cooked panini,"We got this because it was a ""suggested buy"" to go with our Cuisinart Griddler. We were expecting recipes for cooked panini, but very few of these are. The recipes look delicious, the photos are gorgeous, but it wasn't really a good companion for our new appliance."
1,Pretentious,"I was so disappointed in this book because there were very few recipes that called for a panini maker. In addition, most of the recipes consisted of specialty foods that you wouldn't normally have in your pantry or fridge. For example some of the ingredients needed were: Greek oregano, white bread made with unbleached flour, cornichons (aka pickled gherkin cucumbers), imported canned tuna, etc. The author recommended only ""high end"", imported/gourmet foods that were organic. She even noted that although expensive, it's worth spending the extra money. I personally can't see putting all that effort into finding gourmet ingredients for a sandwich."
2,Bleah,"Every once in a while, I get a hankering for clams. Generally buy something and regret it. These are no exception. Bready and heavy- think Mrs. Paul's. Hated them. How I miss Howard Johnsons!"
3,Not really the Rebellion I was hoping for...,The blade is a nice size and has weight to it that only an adult or late teen can hold and if you plan to wield it around I suggest you build up some upper strength. The sword itself however is not like Dante sword in DMC 3 except for the handle. THAT IS ALL that resembles the TRUE REBELLION. The blade doesn't have the scull that Dante's bears nor does it have the two curves in the blades end. Instead it's more like a club (like in cards) at the end. If you are a true DMC fan this blade will go 50/50 on you depending on what you expect. For me I was hoping for something better. Heck if they make one that is EXACTLY like it then I will WITHOUT a doubt purchase it but this one you might want to stay away from.
1,Dog Tie Out,"Quality is good, but this is a very difficult hook to operate, and takes two hands to get it open.Very disappointed in this product."
5,This is a terrific product!,"I have tried various speaker phone adapters out there and this one is by far the best. I used to have a factory installed speaker phone in my car and TravelSpeak's sound quality is actually BETTER! I really like that it charges my phone, too."
3,one interesting pedal,"I've been using the hot rod for the last few months for guitar lines needing less distortion than what i have my amp (or danelectro fab tone) set to. The product's description that the contour knob will give different tones is true, but to me they all sound like theyre being played through various sorts of tin cans, pipes, etc. I personally quite like these sounds but I am not sure how many others will. Like the other digitech pedals I own, this thing is very well built and easy to use."
2,inaccurate description.,"This item does not fit a 1983 Escort wagon as claimed. The arm is several inches too long and hole at the base for the shaft is much too large. It looks like it may fit late 80's (86-90) hatchbacks, but highly unlikely it fits anything earlier."
4,A Reader Response Review-from my eyes only,"To me, this book is a romantic love story about the building of a relationship between a mother and a daughter, the building of a relationship between two best friends...the daughter dealing with becoming a young woman and the romantic drama of a boy and a girl becoming a man and wife. It's a great romantic story about the transition of growing from a little girl into a young woman. That's where I think a lot of women will be able to relate. As I was reading this novel, I could hear the stories that my female friends have told me about their transition into adult life. A lot of things in the book was identical to some of the experiences they have told me about their young womanhood journey. One suggestion: for me the cover didn't tell the complete story of the depth of the novel so as they say, ""Don't judge a book by its cover."""
1,An unhappy AP Student writes a review,"This novel is on my not to read list, because of the author herself. I have never read it and will not becuase I know this novel is representative of Corey Ward's life and probably contains her bigotted views of the world. For being such an intelligent woman she is very closed minded. She was a substitue for our AP American history class and wasted valuable study time. She spent almost all of the of our class period digging into our personal lives, which will probably be included in one of the novels that is published by her own company. I would not read this book and never will."
3,One of the best TV shows ever!,"Ally McBeal was my favorite TV show with exception of ""I Love Lucy"". However Lucy is still being played in reruns and has been for over fifty years.I wish the studios and copyright people would realize the injustice of this delay on Ally release so I could purchase it and enjoy it again. Hey, not only would it make me happy and thousands of others but is would generate the greedy uppers their precious millions of dollars. Come on and get with the program and give us Ally McBeal back to laugh and cry with. Thanks for letting me get that out!"
5,ALLY MCBEAL THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON,I HAVEN'T WATCHED IT YET. THE SERVICE FROM ORDERING TO RECEIVING WAS EXCELLENT AS ARE ALL MY ORDERS FROM AMAZON.COM.
1,Why is this show only available in Europe???,"I find it ridiculous that Ally McBeal hasn't been released on DVD in the States. I went to France recently and ended up getting the entire series while I was there. I also found My So-Called Life on DVD while I was in the UK awhile back, but luckily, MSCL was finally released in the States yesterday. I don't understand why all these American shows are widely available abroad but not at home. Ally is a great show that deserves 5 stars but the lack of availability for the home audience is why I'm giving it one. Hopefully, the powers-that-be will finally get a clue and release this to their loyal (and willing to spend $$$) fan base."
1,Music Licensing is the devil!,"Music licensing issues are holding back the release of the DVD for the Ally McBeal series. The cost of implementing the episodes as is - with all the music intact - would be astronomical just because of the ridiculously expensive song rights they'd have to pay for. So, rather than service the fans, the network is trying to keep its costs down since I'm sure they've done a cost-profit analysis and found it wanting. Which is fine and practical for them, but very, very unpleasant for viewers. Sure, a couple episodes are available... but that only feeds the rage at not being able to watch the WHOLE season. There's this gut feeling that the network doesn't love its viewers much - or at all."
5,"Amazing, wonderful and cutting edge",This series broke ground in every area possible and each week went to a new place with a new idea. It never grew old and always entertained. I have waited too many years for this to come out on DVD and bought the full set the day it did.
4,An Ax to Grind,"Most of the reviews of this book prior to mine are very accurate. The book is a very interesting read for persons with a bit of WWII history under their belt. I would not recommend this book for a novice of WWII. The author certainly has an ax to grind with the American position in the war and it's aftermath. That being said, and knowing that at the outset, this book can be very informative."
4,Nice little kit,"Not a lot of information about bonsai included, but enough to get us going. My son is excited that he has plants growing."
3,Too fast,"The selection is large and familiar, the arrangements are attractive, and the vocal ensemble is first-rate...the more's the pity, then, that these beautiful songs are given such abbreviated, rushed treatments. Literally, these are one- to two-minute ""snippets,"" performed about 1/3 faster than you've ever heard them before. This CD seems designed as an ""acoustic sampler"" album (and it makes a good one), rather than a tool to assist people in entering into actual worship."
3,Collection of Contemporary Praise,"This is a collection of contemporary praise music. These are not the original cuts recorded by the original artists. The songs are also very simple. It's not acoustic by the way, but that's not important. Nuthin' fancy. The songs are only about two minutes long with many less than two minutes. Many of the songs include the choruses only.I got it so that I could learn to play the songs. I downloaded the chord progressions off the internet, and I learned the chords. Some of the songs seem a little bit faster paced than the original so if you can play along with this CD, then you are certainly ready for the church band.For my purposes, this CD is a very useful tool."
3,Essentially a blast from the past...,"If it were 1993, this would be an absolutely fantastic worship album. However, my experience in listening to this album was more nostalgic than worshipful. Quite frankly, many of the songs, especially in the style of this album, are extremely dated.However, there are clearly some songs that will become part of the long-term musical lexicon of the church, such as ""Great is the Lord,"" ""Awesome God,"" and ""Thy Word.""To be truthful, I had a lot of fun singing along with this album. These songs harken back to a previous generation of ground-breaking worship music. While there is an element of cheesy synthesizer sound to some of the songs, it's still music and lyrics that glorify and praise the Lord. Though I'd prefer some classic hymns of the faith or some fresher contemporary worship music, there is still a place to sing along with an album like this."
5,A favorite CD,"I have listened to Acoustic Worship again and again, and honestly, I like the selections and worship team assembled better than version 2-4 of the same series. There's something about an original where sometimes they get it right, and this is one of those times.There's a wonderful balance of voices, tempos, and songs that are popular and familiar but not overly trendy. These are the songs you can sing to the Lord with heartfelt praise and lose yourself in the process. It's more than a ""listening CD."" It is clearly designed to encourage participation in praise much like a worship team in a church is not a concert to listen to but praise leader to encourage others to lift their voices as well.Well done; well done!"
4,Myths and Legends...,"i am reading this book in school and it is good for like study-type reading...but i wouldn't suggest picking it up for fun because the stories are all really short and quite choppy. i prefer the stories by Ovid and Hessiod personally, yet cupid and psyche is a favorite too...well...hope this helps!"
5,"An impressively updated, indispensable reference.","This second edition of a classic provides an update on a reference recommended for college-level collections specializing in Chinese literature. Sources of Chinese Tradition has been recognized already as a scholarly staple: in its new form Sources of Chinese Tradition has been extended to include the Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin eras of China and includes invaluable source readings on history and literature of the times, from the 18th-century Qing civilization onward."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"Don't waste your money. The battery life is next to nothing, we had to replace them almost immediately. There are much better choices in phones. My mistake to buy this one."
2,Sandal,"These shoes look really nice, but my foot slipped from side to side in the back so I had to return them. They were not tight enough across the top to hold my heal from slipping to the side."
1,Another failed creationist effort,"...Dembski makes many fundamental errors in dealing with Darwinism, to the extent that, fundamentally, his book utterly misses the mark. Darwinism is not aiming for complexity or anything else -- it's just about what survives. Complexity, which does not pose any particular problem for evolutionary theory even though evolution isn't seeking it out, is what sometimes happens along the way."
2,Lunch at the Soup Kitchen,"This book was read as part of a university seminar seeking to understand the ""science"" behind the Intelligent Design movement. This book was the first broadly published accounting of William Dembski's ideas on Complex Specified Information and his ""Law of Conservation of Information."" After reading and several hours of discussion by seminar members, we agreed that the book was written in a style meant to impress readers with jargon rather than lead them through a consistent and logical argument for Intelligent Design. Even apart from the numerous unanswered published criticisms of Dembski's hypotheses, all seminar members found serious inconsistencies and transparencies of his arguments. His ideas boil down to Paley's original ""gee whiz, life is too complicated to have arisen by natural mechanisms.""This book ought to be read so its weak arguments can be dissected and not be accepted in any consideration of Intelligent Design."
4,ignore the naysayers,"Ignore the one-star reviews. The unifying factor in all of them is an irrational hatred of Christianity, a misrepresentation of both Christian teachings and ID, and a reliance on ad hominem attacks. Really, now, I thought most people got beyond such name-calling by about, oh, the third grade.Despite the bombast, no one has adequately answered either Behe or Dembski. I think the evolutionists would be embarrassed by now by their reliance on so many just-so stories to support an increasingly implausible theory."
1,Martingale in disguise,"If you trust this book, you will lose a lot of money. This book uses a modified martingale system. Do a search on martingale, and you will see what it is. There's nothing new here, other than you might lose your money slower, but you'll still lose it over the long run."
4,real nice,the hanger will break but then you just put a kid's hanger in it's place and it works great. cute too.
2,a disappointment,"This book has some very nice photos, but on the whole it wasn't what I wanted. I intended this to be my first and only book on Gaudi, but it won't serve that purpose. The photos don't include any of the usual angles -- for example, there are far too few shots of the wonderful roof of Casa Battlo, and none that adequately show the sinuous serpent-back tiles. The text explains the symbolism of the roof features, but the photos fail to show the features described in the text. Some of the wide angle shots looking up at ceilings are hard to interpret. The book is best as a complement if one already has a book with shots taken from the standard angles. In that respect, it would be excellent. I won't buy a book like this again without looking at it first."
5,Great Book!,Having just returned from a trip to Spain that included several days in Barcelona I was delighted to find this book available to purchase. The pictures are beautiful and very representative of the architecture you will see if you spend a few days in the lovely city of Barcelona. I definitely recommend the book.
5,"Xzibit, the Man","(An awesome CD and lyrically he hits real life issues. His last track ""Thank You"" is a beautiful song to all his fans and is very heartfelt. ""Family Values"" is a great piece to uplift women and he even hit some controversy of his exgirl that went with Usher and tried to plant a baby on both of them on ""Scandalous B******"". He even tries to uplift blacks and hispanics on the song ""Black & Brown"" where he's urging them to avoid prison {hopefully people will listen more and bob their heads less}. There's a slight Christian value in a few of his music, but he definately is street. An overall excellent CD and has awesome replay value.)"
1,Not as good as i expected.,I thought these vocals were mostly flat. It just wasn't as good as the real juan luis guerra.
3,Love this bike but TECHNICAL SUPPORT IS NON EXISTANT,"Not a single issue with this bike, had it for almost a year and it's swell. Very comfortagble to ride while I sit in front of my TV in the AM, getting the news of the day.I cannot say the same thing about the manual or support. Before xmas, I watited 20 minutes on hold and finally gave up. Today, I'm at 37 minutes and counting. This was not a cheap purchase, you'd think that they could answer after half an hour."
5,Funniest movie EVER,"Anybody reading this should buy this movie now. This is without a doubt the funniest kung-fu movie I've ever seen. Me and my buddies have watched it countless times and we still crack up everytime we see it. This movie has the worst editing I've ever seen, actors with absolutly ZERO talent, horrible special effects, hideous dubbing. So why do we love it? well because it's so bad that it's a classic. The fighting scenes will have you rolling on the floor, the dialogue will crack you up, the extras are funny in how they die, the main villains use horrible weapons (slinky dildo anyone?). If you have any sense of bizarre humour, do yourself a favor and buy it."
5,the bomb!!!!!,"best unintentional comedy of all time. get this if you like your kung-fu cheesy, or if you wanna watch something while you're drunk."
2,Banned in 34 countries? Cause it was bad,"Now don't be fooled by the video box stating that it is the most violent and graphic martial arts movie to date. well when it was made it probably was, but now? no chance. It follows a vengful fighter who swares revenge on his teachers killer. once he kills him he is conciderd the greatest figher of all, therefore he is challenged by others till his family is attacked and he is forced to fight what seems to be his final fight. The death toll is sky high with Chan killing about 100 men in one battle. But besides the over all slaughter, the martial arts seemd slow, and there were no fancy techniques or shapes, it just seemed like a bunch of angry drunk guys kicking and punching. It's worth watching just to say you saw it, but i don't think it's classic material. then again, it may be what your lookin for, all you can do is watch:)"
2,OK Book,I wanted this book for a long time but was underwhelmed by it; it seemed more like a dictionary than anything groundbreaking.
4,Superb fado music and singing,"I had thought that Maritza was the reincarnation of Amalia Rodrigues but now having heard Katia Guerreiro, I am beginning to change my mind.This is a really lovely cd."
4,sofisticated rock with drive,"This belgian band sounds like a mix of the Cars and Radiohead. Songs differ a lot, show unexpected turns and have good drive especially ""Forever"", ""The One"" and ""Such a Day""."
1,A waste of time.,"This movie is a waste of time and money. The acting is poor, the special effects are poor, the plot is poor."
1,pretty horrible,"Id love to see mystery science theater picks this up, id watch it again. Below my b movie standards by far."
4,Delightful,"This charming opera is an ironic look at social repression and innocence. Based on a Guy de Maupassant story, Albert Herring is the story of a simple village boy who breaks out of the constraints imposed by his controlling mother and the village elders. The libretto is written with a gently ironic plot and witty dialogue. The music is both lovely and clever. Britten assigns each major character music consonant with his or her character and there is some really impressive ensemble singing. The quality of this performance is excellent. The individual singers are all excellent and the ensemble singing is first rate. A real must for anyone who likes Britten."
1,Total fiction,"After reading this book in its entirety, I now realize that it was made for Mr. Power's personal gratification and not to enhance the lives of those that suffer discrimination within law enforcement."
5,"an excellent book ,definitely required reading,a masterpiece","The minute you pick up this book, you will not want to put it down,Mr powers really captures the readers interest from the onset. When you read this book you will get a feel of what it is like growing up in urban America. There were certain parts of the book that I found difficult to read simply because I could visualize these things happening.I wondered how painful it must of been to write these things,Mr powers does not hold any -thing back.Minorites in law enforcement will also benifit from this book because it deals with some of the issues that are often talked about, but seldom is there anything ever done."
5,Excellent teaching book,I found this book an excellent support in teaching and invaluable as an occasional reference in my practical work in industry. It is particularly gratifying to see that free surface flows are covered well. Best book I have seen so far in the field.
3,Constant readjustment is required.,I have to say that they feel ok when worn and they do feel and look like the can provide good all around protection.The problem is that I have to constantly keep readjusting them. I didn't notice that they had moved from the correct placement and hurt my knee unprotected. They are OK if you are ok with constant readjustments.
2,Not as good as other walls,The virtual wall is a great product but there are several to choose from. I bought this model to supplement the compact virtual wall that came with my irobot. There is a big performance difference. The robot sometimes goes right past the original wall even when it's set on maximum distance where the compact stops the irobot in it's tracks and will not allow it to pass. Look for a compact or one of the newer models and pass on this style virtual wall.
5,Works fine,This area is not for ordering problems. It is for how the products work. I robot is top of the line quality. I love all their products.
1,Don't bother,"This thing is mostly useless, if I could give it zero stars, I would. The interface is clumsy and poorly designed and it's too easy to accidently push the buttons and change the settings, or even reset the whole thing, erasing all the memory! I'm surprised that Memorex would place their name on such a product, they must be getting desperate."
4,"great product, but annoying chirp","This product does everything you would expect it to. As it says, it holds 60 names and phone numbers, and has other functions as well. But if you're like me, then you primarily want this for its phonebook propeties. It is a bit of a hassle to put the numbers in, and once in they can only be deleted, and not edited. It also has an annoying chirping noise which you cant turn off. All in all, this is a great product at a great price, you will be highly satisfied if you buy it. I know i am"
3,Low Memory But small,"This is a great organizer if you don't have many things to put in it! It doesn't have lots of memory though, but its small size makes up for this!"
4,Seemed to be a nice coffee table volume for a casual collector,It was a gift- I hope the content provided value to my friend. I will now count out the seven additionally required words plus an extra ten to complete the sentence.
3,good overview,"Good book, nice pictures. Not extensive in its information but nice and not so expensive. Good to start with, like I did. It is translated, so you could find a copy somewhere in your own language. But the english edition is clear and sound!It is an interesting forst guide into fountain pens and manufacturers."
1,Lame weak not worth $1 in the flea market bin,The band has no real direction and the sound is unbearable. I can't believe that a record company spent money putting this out. Definitely only good as a drink coasters. I am going to pawn it while I can still get three dollars for a disk.
5,City of Washington - Great CD,"If you love bagpipes and celtic music - you will LOVE this CD. The tracks provide a great combination of traditional bagpipes, fiddles and various percussion instruments. The recording quality is excellent. Don't pass this one up!"
5,"Excellent CD, not your average pipe band music",Great CD with a wide variety of music types including fiddle and other percussion. Nicely done and fantastic musicians
4,Unusual insights into a king's predilictions,"When one reads about kings and presidents, it usually concerns official business. You expect to hear standard biographical data, educational and vocational matters, and government involvement. Not in this book.By way of an adopted stray dog, we learn about the lesser-known side of Thailand's king. Monarchy can be a fascinating topic; there are apparently some nations that do quite nicely without the help of democracy. Here, it is possible we can gain insight into a king's methods by considering his interaction with dogs."
2,A weak finale for a promising series.,"This, the last book of the ""Chaos"" trilogy, takes what should have been the final 4 chapters of the previous installment and spreads them unbearably thin. Rather than a swift and powerful conclusion you get a shockingly long morass of increasingly obscure nonsense. Unless you enjoy trying to juggle 30 or 40 mythological bit-part characters (who often have multiple names, yay!) while the internal logic of the story is taken beyond the breaking point, give this book a pass and make up whatever ending you'd like for Amelia and crew."
5,Mythology Lover's Dream Come True,"The Chaos Triglogy is a wonderfully written book about god and goddess-like beings in the modern age. This isn't Percy Jackson, though! It is written very much for adult reading levels, without being inappropriate for younger readers. The story line, the characters, and the vocabulary may make this book inaccessible to younger readers exploring fantasy novels. However, if you know someone who learned to read because of Harry Potter or Percy Jackson, have matured beyond them, and if they have some decent background knowlege of mythology, then this trilogy would be a wonderful next step."
5,Classic Mythology reimagined for the 21st century,"The final installment continues right were the second novel left off and is by far the most action packed book of the trilogy. Most of the book is dedicated to the all out battle between a couple rogue Olympians and the Children of Chaos. Wright's conclusion to the series is every bit as imaginative, intellectual and funny as the first two parts. The three books comprise one big story that takes place over the course of just a few weeks and will not make sense if read out of sequence. Starting with book one is essential. Repackaging the three books in one volume someday would be ideal. Overall, the series is one of the most original and creative works of sci-fi / fantasy (I can't tell which genera this story falls into) that I've ever read. I greatly enjoyed this series and would highly recommend it."
3,"If you liked the first two, you're going to buy it anyway...","Reviewing the third book in a trilogy is a bit of an exercise in futility, but here goes...The first half of this book is plotless wandering through what are known in the Role-playing game world as ""Mini-quests"", but it picked up my interest again about halfway through, just in time to lose it again on a climactic battle that is a study in the definition of the word ""Overblown"".But,if you read the first two, then you just GOTTA know what happens to Amelia and her friends, so go ahead and get it, you don't really have a choice."
3,Interesting if you don't get lost,"I generally enjoyed John Wright's Chaos series of books. The final book ""Titan's of Chaos"" I was quite excited to read as the first two books had built up an excellent set of characters as well as a very interesting story line. The idea of 5 ""children"" finding their powers and understanding how they fit in with ancient myths and legends is very creative. The problem I had with the book was it had way too much detail and it used alternate names for the gods rather than standard mythological god names like Zeus or Athena which left me a little confused at time. Also there was lots of spin-off information provided and unnecessary dialogue that slowed the story down. The ending was a little weak after a great build-up.On the other hand if he wrote a 4th book about these characters I would be inclined to purchase and read it."
4,Slow finish,"Not as good as the first two books. Most of the important resolutions happen near the beginning of this book. It takes a long, long time to wind down. Still, it was pretty good. The conclusion was satisfying, and the problems were well resolved w/o resorting to mass shifting."
3,Super Reader,"Not so much at the end, though.The crazy stuff that happens in here with all the various different types of Chaos and Olympian and other assorted superpowers floating around is a bit like if you crosed Michael Moorcock's Second Ether denouement with Simon R. Green's Nightside, only with 17 year old sort of immortal schoolchildren.The latter, of course, makes it somewhat lamer than either, as does the what seems to be a rather rushed ending - almost like 'whoops, out of pagecount, finish it fast.'"
3,Long time Nimbus wearer,"I finally ran out of online sources to purchase Gel Nimbus VII last year, so I ""upgraded"" to the IX.I have since put on 188 miles on these shoes. A few things I have noticed:1) initially I got many hotspots on the shoes as these seem a lot tighter in the front than my previous ones.2) they feel lighter3) I have recently noticed holes appearing in the left ankle support area on both shoes.As I have only run in Asics, I feel brand-stuck and therefore find these shoes overall decent. I think there were some mistakes with the IXs which were probably/hopefully fixed with the Xs.If you have run in the Nimbus' before, I would use these shoes. However, if you have not been sized professional, I would not take the risk online with these."
4,Beautiful,It did take a bit to receive but it was worth the wait. Cast beautiful rainbows on the walls. Exactly what I was looking for!
1,crystal ball,The item really did not produce the multiple dots of bright color one expected from a crystal piece.Maybe only fully round ones do that...this was more pear shape.
3,BUYER BEWARE,"Be careful who you are buying from and what you are buying. I have made 3 purchases from a vendor that guarantees that their crystals are genuine Asfour crystals. The first 2 purchases the crystals were stunning, clear cut and beautiful. On this last purchase the 2 crystals I received were not Asfours! The cut was different from the previous 2 orders,the top had a U shaped gouge (instead of flat) that was sharp and rough on the inside, and there was a small chip in one of them. Asfour does not sell a crytal with a U shaped gouge on the top! I use these to make a high-quality product. These are useless to me now. Be careful for scammers!"
4,Soundstage Presents Chicago in Concert,"Very enjoyable. Would reccomend to person's who remember the group and like their music, or music similar."
4,Bring down the house,"This is the first time I've seen Chicago live. I've always been a fan but never seen them live. This show rocks, no flaws except the guitar is not as loud as it needs to be to keep in sync with the horns. But the dvd is worth it. Gotta love the soundstage concerts."
2,dvd,"not what I had expected from chicago. a poor and bad recording all around, but that happens when you can no longer sample in-store"
2,I wouldn't bother.....,"I saw Chicago when they were Chigago Transit Authority. They put on an excellent concert and jammed every song. I saw them after they became famous and the concert was very dull. Every song played just like the record. I thought that, after all these years, they would be better. They aren't. No jamming here. Every song done as the original with maybe a couple short variations. I was very dissapointed. They are capable of doing some good concerts but I really can't say that this is one of them."
1,Surprisingly Disappointed,"Chicago sounds like thry are on their last leg. The vocals are very weak and lack tempo. Perhaps I'm spoiled by the most recent Eagles concert however, I have to say this is the worst I've ever seen of Chicago. This includes live concerts I've attended and my CD's. For some reason they have no ""punch."" If it weren't for the audience you'd fall asleep watching this performance."
5,great sheets,"I am a massage therapist, and use a ton of sheets...this are the softest sheets I have ever used and my customers love them!!!"
1,Terrible Pressure Washers,"I work in a small engine shop and see at least 3 Karcher Pressure washers (any model) come in everyday. The pumps all go on them and a replacement pump costs the consumer $700. The 'warranty' should cover the pump but since they've had so many problems this season, they are no longer providing replacement pumps, instead putting dealers on lists for reconditioned pumps which will probably stop working in the next month or two - conveniently outside of the warranty dates. I would never buy this product and would not recommend it to another person."
2,Leaking oil,"I purchased this product from Amazon, (side note this cannot be returned to amazon if defective which Amazon should have as a check box waiver instead of fine print). Easily assembled. Should have read the other reviews. It started perfectly. It also leaked oil. Two gaskets needed to be replaced. I took it to my mechanic and paid to have repaired as this would most likely cost $20-50 to ship return. I would not buy anything else from Karcher or Amazon. Buy local and you have person to deal with if it fails. I hope this is the only repair... It was also backfiring and shutting off after about 20-30 minutes of run time."
1,Karcher pressure problems,"Karcher pressure washers have a common with sticking pump valves, especially the unloader valve. The brass parts that the valves are made from corode real fast. Most people start having problems after the first year of use because of the scale that is caused by city water. Karcher does not provide a manual for its pumps and does not have a tech help phone line. They force you to take the washer to an expensive repair station.[...]If Karcher made these valves of better grade materials and lubricated them with waterproof lubricants, this would not be an issue."
1,poor power Karcher G 3025,I had owned a power washer of the same rating as the Karcher G 3025 and find the Karcher to not have the same cleaning power as the one I had. I have been disappointed in the performance. I contacted Karcher customer support and they have been less than helpful and slow in responding. I would not recommend this product!
5,Nice Power Washer,"A local club retailer had a very good price for this power washer, so I bought one this weekend. I washed the back patio, rear windows, sidewalk, front walkway, and an external teac table. This unit has amazing cleaning capabilities provided the proper water supply. I highly recommenc it."
4,Karcher 3000psi/2.5GPM Pressure Washer (Honda 187cc),"It's as good a pressure washer as I've ever used before: Easy start, maneuverable, even flow, good selection of wand tips. Karcher is a respected brand. This machine's price at Amazon was unbeatable (no tax & free shipping helped). Recommended for ""industrial strength"" applications -- most homeowners don't need this much power."
1,Poor pressure & nozzle spray,"I used this once today & am returning it to the store tomorrow. The pressure when using all but the smallest nozzle is weak and not much better than my electric Karcher 1700 psi. Additionally, the spray tips exude uneven spray patterns. I am very disappointed."
4,Elaborating the formula,"Underrated disc of slightly more sublime proportion compared to similar dated early-mid career output, even if it can feel a little underdeveloped. With focus on more elaborate songwriting and looser chemistry, more personality seeps into the less regimented session."
5,RVG reissue series,"This is just a general review on the whole RVG reissues that have been remastered over the past year and a half and released from Japan. The sound quality of these cd's is excellent,and the mini-LP sleeve packeging is a delight in nostalgia and presentation. The series is still ongoing, judging from the ads I read in Swing Journal which is a Japanese magazine that I subscribe to which keeps me abreast of the latest reissues there.If anyone is into serious jazz reissues, I suggest they try Japan for availability and variety. Its good to see Amazon.com offering these for sale as I have just relocated from Singapore (where they are available) and am still trying to find someone who will keep my supply up. The Riverside and Prestige series from Japan (also in mini-LP cases) are also fantastic series. Yes, they are pricey but I think serious collectors will find a way to overcome that!"
5,Gutsy Lady,"This book is so VERY readable!!! The reader can immediately get into the feeling of the heroine (Ruth) as she tries to adapt to the loss of her husband and the adventure of traveling to another continent. This woman, to be blunt, had been living a life for her family, and now since her husband's death and her children being of adult age, she can explore areas of her interest that were never available before. Sharon Ervin puts in all down, vividly, where we can follow the changes that occur in Ruth's life, and it keeps the reader entranced page by page until Ruth has lived her adventure. Ruth was one gutsy broad, well lady. Thanks, Sharon."
1,NOT AS DESCRIBED,"I ordered 12 boxes, for 120 studs. I received 113 studs, packaged in various qty's in plastic zip lock baggies - NOT BOXES. I buy these often and should be in a Dorman box. Most of them didn't even look like Dorman items, but appear to be physically the same. 2 of the studs were used, previously installed. 1 was incorrect. Leaving me short 1 complete box.No problem, this should be easy to fix.With any other company maybe, not Amazon! They wanted me to pay for a second replacement order. No, I just need 1 box. No, we can't just send 1 box we have to replace the entire order.So now I'm returned those 3 bad studs for a refund on that one box."
1,the DVD didn't play!,I first rented this movie from Scarecrow on Laser. This is probably my favorite all time Erotic Chinese flick. Unfortunatly the DVD didn't play. It sticks during the first 10 minutes. I have to forward the movie 10 minutes tobe able to see the rest of the film. I wonder if other DVD copys do the same? I am returning mine...
4,Real classy,"This scent is really cool. Not overbearing. Not to masculine, yet not to feminine. It's just right for any occasion."
5,WHAT'S THAT SMELL????,"GREAT FRAGANCE, LAST ALL DAY, AND EVEN WHEN YOU DON'T SMELL IT OTHERS WILL COMMENT ON HER PERFUME!!!! GREAT CHOICE!!!"
5,Splash,"Just a Splash works just great. Service, delivery, all worked fine and the product was just what I ordered. Can't seem to find this in the stores and wouldn't leave home without it."
1,GOTTA BE COUNTERFEIT- - -,"I really do love this scent, but was VERY DISAPPOINTED! I put it on and within 5 minutes the scent was gone.....so later I saturated myself with it and within 15 minutes the scent was GONE..GONE..GONE!!Do not waste your money on this one. It's got to be a fake....a counterfeit. You cannot get your money back on any perfumes either, Amazon won't let you return it so I wasted all that money. Just go to the department store, pay a little more and get the real thing!!"
1,Poor product,"This product I received from Amazon was definitely not up to their high standards. Product was either very diluted or a very old product. I would never order cologne, after shave or any similar product by the mail, as you never know what you are getting. Amazon was very good about a complete customer refund. Amazon always takes care of their customers. I would still order other items from Amazon, they are truly a great customer pleaser."
4,I want to smell it on the man i'm with,">>>>not myself. I loved the scent on the test strip, in the magazines, and then I tried it on me. It's a very clean scent, but on me, it felt a bit too mannish. BUt it is a really great scent to try out at an inexpensive price. Plus, if you don't like it, someone in your life probably will."
4,Good scent but smells too strong....more a male cent,This scent is great but for a unisex perfume it smells too strong....more on the manly side...should be more sutle
2,Correct sending of the tracking,"Good nights gentlemen of fragranceNet porfavor need that they order me the correct number of tracking to do the due follow-up to him to my package, porfavor they agradesco that it do brief possible mas"
4,Great Cologne/Bent Spray Cap,"I love this cologne; any time my wife smells it, she thinks of when we met because this was all I used to wear back then. For the price on this size bottle, I don't think this deal can be beat anywhere. The only problem (and the reason I gave this item 4 stars,) was that there are two caps in the package. One is the regular bottle cap, the other is the spray nozzle cap. The spray nozzle cap was bent in to the point where it would not go on the bottle. I fixed this problem by lining it up, then using a heavy lighter to knock the cap down to the threads, and used the threads to widen the cap the rest of the way by twisting it on. Now it has a perfect (if not tighter than usual,) seal...and I have no complaints. I would definitely buy this from Amazon again; even if the spray nozzle cap were mangled beyond use, they would have replaced the entire item at no cost to me, so there would have been no loss; just a longer wait."
5,Excellent,Muy buen precio. Y llego mucho más rápido de lo que esperaba. Además que el producto es uno de los mejores.
2,Nothing Like the Original,"Tried this recently at Macy's. It had great smell for a small amount sprayed. The one bought from amazon is very diluted so you can hardly smell the fragrance, even if you spray a lot of it on. Amazon delivered the item as expected and on time but I too was disappointed with the product. I suggest you buy this item off the shelf at a department store such as Macy's, JC Penney, etc."
5,I fell in love with this scent!,"For those of you who absolutely despise a musky, deep smell, this cologne/perfume is perfect for you! I love how light the smell is without losing any aromatic power that you look for in a scent. It's interesting that it is unisex as well, and the price is magnificent for such a large bottle!"
2,"After an hour, there will be no odor, nothing left","Honestly, I read the previous comments on this issue, but bought the item anyway. Now, I think they were right."
4,CK One,"Ck One by calvin Klein for Men ,Eau de Toilette is very good fragrance .I satisfied and I love that parfum."
5,Excellet,"the best perfume I ever had, I looove it, and it's cheap! It was on time and everything was ok"
5,Great Deal,"I'm a big Calvin Klien product fan and I purchased cologne at a great price here at Amazon. I usually pay almost twice the price for Calvin Klein or other designer brand colognes. The S&H was perfect(FREE)and I received faster than I expected. As always, another great purchase from Amazon.com"
5,A Clean Sporty Scent,"I love this fragrance, I have been wearing it for years. This fragrance is for those ladies (like me) that totally love the smell of men's cologne and have always wanted to use a man's cologne but were afraid to actually wear a man's cologne. This scent strikes a perfect balance between a womens and man's cologne.I Love It!!!"
3,nice fragrance,I love the fragrance but I'm disappointed that it doesn't last long. But it was worth the price.
3,Ok,"This was ok, but didn't love it as much as the other one. My husband likes to wear it, but I do try to get him to put the other one on. I guess it appeals more to men than a woman because I think it's more a manly smell than the ones I usually wear. A great gift for a man too, especially with X-mas coming up."
4,excellent,perfume and the kindle case are great and suit excellent. The smell of perfume is great and the cover fits perfectly to kindle.
5,Love CK One,Love CK One! I dislike heavy flower scents and CK One's light citrusy fragrance is perfect for me! I can wear it every day. It's been my signature fragrance for over 20 years.
5,Women like it on me,All I have to say is that the women on my job always say I smell good when I wear CK One. It'z one of my favorite fragrances.
5,Winner!!! Amazon,"Well, Amazon does it again. Ck One is a name brand of cologne.Amazon had it at the price and the size I wanted. Great deal!Gotta love deals in this time and economy."
4,"A Beautiful book: wonderful illustrations, comprehensive treatment of modern geology","This is a great volume. It accompanies the BBC TV series of the same name. Unfortunately this wonderful TV series has never been released on DVD. The book is magnificently illustrated and provides the layman with a comprehensive and competent overview of modern geology since the rise of plate tectonics.I'd recommend reading it in tandem with University of Melbourne geologist Ian Plimer's ""Short History of Planet Earth"". Plimer's volume deals with some of the more controversial issues, supervolcanoes, global warming etc. Still the best companion for Simon Lamb's book is the TV series. Hopefully one day the BBC will get around to releasing it on DVD."
3,Kind of cute - very short,"Has John Cleese's great humor. But the film is very short. It looks like it was edited with a meat cleaver. Total lack of continuity. Example: Cleese goes into the estate's kitchen naked, come out serviceably (if a little strangely) dressed, with no explanation of how or why."
2,Unless Your Buying This to See Connie Booth . . .,". . . don't buy it. Faulty Towers is the funniest thing John and Connie ever did together--this is nowhere near that level. There are only two pieces of Cleese's work I enjoyed less than this: ""How to Irritate People"" and ""The Strange Case of the End of Civilization, as We Know It"". There are a few laughs in ""Romance"" but seeing a most lovely Connie in the buff is its only truly redeeming trait, and that is only redeeming for half of us . . . The funniest Cleese-Booth work ever created is the ""Fawlty Towers"" complete set. It is pure genius and you can watch the episodes a dozen times, each, without tiring a bit!"
2,not what I expected,"I was looking forward to this being a good movie because John Cleese is a good actor. Disappointed is what I was. Maybe after watching all the Fawly Towers episodes I expected more. I never even laughed. I don't think I will watch this again. The best thing about the movie was the scenery and I don't mean bare bottoms. I still really like John Cleese, but not this movie."
2,Come on now #2.,"I gave this 2 stars because everyone gave it 5. If you just look at the star rating you might be misled. Five stars is really overdoing it. The Meaning of Life is absolutely 5 stars, but this is really more like 3-3 1/2 stars. I am a big fan of John Cleese and most of his endeavors, but all his efforts can't be 5 star material.Overall, a pretty good flick, quite charming."
2,The movie is worth your time and money. This DVD is not.,"I'm surprised that no one has mentioned the poor quality of this particular DVD. I own it and even though I got it fairly cheaply I still feel like I got ripped off. This DVD has been created from a very beat-up copy of the film, full of scratches and other signs of wear and tear. To make matters worse, some of the nudity has been chopped out. To call it ""edited"" would be putting it too kindly. Whoever was responsible for the cutting simply removed some of the more revealing frames of film, taking the corresponding bits of dialogue with them.It IS a charming, funny little movie. It deserves better treatment. This DVD should be avoided in the hope that a better transfer will come along."
4,Very amusing,"This is a fun story. John Cleese and Connie Booth perform well together. A well-written story about a budding romance between a musician and a princess. There are a few parts where John Cleese throws in a Monty Pythonish type of dialog, which adds to the hilarity of the show."
3,Wish they'd put a harder center in pin cushions,I'm always losing my needles in the pin cushion itself because nothing stops them from disappearing into the interior and then I get to play Russian roulette with my fingers trying to dig them out without getting stabbed by the needles.
2,God this book bored me to tears,"I love detective novels about forged books, my all time favorite being, ""An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth-Century Pamphlets"", by John Carter, and Graham Pollard. The very best books about forgeries tell you a great deal about books and manuscripts, not just the fraud in question. I had hoped that this book would be in that vein -- cool, dry, utterly objective, facts-only, and absolutely convincing, while at the same time opening up the world of ancient manuscripts and how to reason about them.Instead it is unconvincing and inflamed in the *weirdest* sort of way. It seems as though Stephen Carlson really wants to settle a score with Morton Smith. I was looking for an exquisitely argued piecing together of a puzzle. Instead I got a very erudite, very lengthy disquisition bundled up with a huge number of angry neurosies, not all of them Smith's by any means."
1,A HILARIOUS pack of LIES,"If Carlson *truly* believed that Secret Mark was a modern forgery, he would simply track down the manuscript and carbon-date the parchment/ink.However, since he knows it's genuine, (but doesn't fit with his version of Christianity) his only option is embarrass himself with his feeble arguments about how Morton Smith ""forged"" it: Clement is TOO much like Clement. The Morton Salt theory (hilarious). Etc.Bottom Line: Don't waste your time or your money."
1,Note to Christian Apologists: Keep Trying...,"Baylor University Press lists no credentials for Stephen C. Carlson. His bio simply says: Stephen C. Carlson is Partner in Ditthavong & Carlson (Fairfax, VA). Although this apparently not current, I checked. So he's a patent attorney. So what you have is yet another Christian ""pseudo academic"" attempting to take down a well respected academic and scholar.And this is what happens whenever any claim crosses with established canon about Jesus of Nazareth: the apologists come out of the woodwork and pile on claiming fraud. Take the recent discovery of a papyrus fragment in which Jesus refers to his wife. Before anything at all is published it's labeled a fraud with absolutely no evidence whatsoever.This book, which is no longer being published, belongs in the same bin with anything published by Jerome Corsi or Orly Taitz."
1,Upset with the Kindle version,"I'm not commenting on the book itself, but on the Kindle version. It has none of the images that the author refers to and presumably are including the hard copy book. Had I known that, I would not have purchased the Kindle edition, and I'm upset to discover that it is not the complete work. I feel as if I've been ripped off."
1,Very fragile,"As soon as I put it on, it broke. I tried to fix it since they don't accept returns once you put it on. 3 charms fell off and it broke again, so I threw it away."
5,A Gift for my friend,"Gifted to my friend on his marriage ,he loves it very much.I have received compliments from him for this EDT gift.I like contradiction for its smooth fragrance , strongly recommended."
3,"One of my favorites ever, not the same...","This used to be one of my favorite fragrances. I received it a few weeks ago, and it smells stronger, not the masculine but soft touch it used to have. Now it smells great but more alcoholic. I called Coty NY (manufacturers), and they told me my bottle was manufactured on december 2010, so it's not expired. Just different. Still love the fragrance though."
1,"Sorry, but do not buy cologne from amazon","I bought this cause I was really excited about the good price. It is DEFINITELY not the real cologne. It smells exactly like it, it may even be made by the same company, but something went wrong with it at some point, either it stored in some place too hot or cold, because the SCENT DOES NOT LAST. I'm telling you, I have bottle that I bought from my local perfume store and it lasts a good 5 hours or so. This scent from this online bottle is gone within in an hour. This is also not a lone case. I also bought a Jean Paul Gaultier cologne on amazon and had the exact same issue. I would not again be swayed by the good prices and simply pay the 20% more at my local store for the real thing. If you buy it here and notice the scent doesn't last, you'll know why"
1,A Contradiction in every sense....,"Must confess that this perfume did certainly live up to its name - A Contradiction to the very concept of a perfume. I wonder how customers have been able to give it a 5 star. I brought this brand, because of the Calvin Klien image, and seeing the reviews. The perfume smelled sick and to top it in a matter of a month, the fragrance seemed missing...it was like spraying water...A loss of $28 :("
1,Smells like rubbing alcohol.,"The item was delivered very promptly. But sadly, the scent smelled like 'rubbing alcohol'. No other way to describe it.I think this will be my first and last time buying cologne online. It's really better to buy it in a store so you can test it first."
4,A bit different but good,"The first time I used this cologne was about 10 years ago. The smell was a little bit better and it had a watery color. Now it has a blueish color and the smell now is a bit stronger. Overall I would rate this product with a 85% compare to what it used to be. Good thing is that they still make that cologne, I am pretty sure that I would buy another bottle in the near future"
5,Very good packaging. And very nice perfume,Very good in every aspect.Price is cheaper than store price. Also not many store carries it.Buy it. it is worth the price.
5,Wow! Got it the next day!,Wow! Ordered yesterday and came today. Got this for christmas present so I don't know if they will like it.
5,clean masculine scent,"This is a clean masculine scent and dosent arrive before I do, its not overpowering so its a good choice for work days.This has been discontinued from Calvin Klein but Amazon has a great price and hassel free shipping so they beat local""perfume outlets"" and no having to deal with pushy sales people. Thanks!"
2,Not What you Said,"You stated this poster is 11""x17"". The paper is 11""x17"" and the ""movie poster"" itself is 11""x12"". Not kool to lie."
2,Hard...,"This book is too hard to search through. Every time I try to flip through the pages, it always skips what I need..."
3,My summary,"This book is very descriptive i liked the definitions and the origins. This book is a little. to long for me and it was hard to navigate. All in all,this was a very interesting dictionary."
2,Juliet mogensen,Julia fox was the first one to meet God so she was the second one to die in the world many people loved her and now miss her !!! she lived in Africa in 1982 she was a good person we all now miss her now almost everyone knows her !!!!The End¡!!!!!!
3,Cool,In day care sitting board lol ikr this is a funny town ya see I'm super board and I'm rofl but this was a good book
5,Book Summary For The New Oxford American Dictionary,This dictionary defines words and letters so well! Now I don't have to flip through a paper dictionary and hunt for one little word for a million years. This is great!
4,What the Oxford ford dictionary was like,I think that the Oxford ford dictionary was good however you may not choose the words that you desire. So my score is about a 3 1/2 stars.
3,Pretty good,This book was better than i thought it would be. It was helpful and useful. Enough with positives this book boring and i did not want to keep looking at it! It was really not any good and i recommend that you do NOT read this book.
2,Dictoriany,It is useful sometimes really when i have homework for my classes which are really boring but it helps .
3,I mean its a dictornary,"I gave it a 3 star rating because, its a dictornary n it was not very in ter resting i mean all it uas is words"
3,This book not up to the OED standard,"Purchased this as a gift and was astonished when the recipient showed me an obvious error on the first day of use. The entry for Howard Dean lists his tenure as governor of Vermont as 1885-2003. Not bad for a guy born in 1948. So, I went to their website www.oup.com/us, hoping to find a way of reporting the error. It lists dozens of editors but none for reference works. Nor does it have an email address for the department responsible for the this product.One wonders if the publisher's marketing department shows the typical arrogant disdain for the opinions of end user purchasers in favor of wholesale outlets. Making it near impossible to report errors seems to indicate they just don't give a damn. If the publisher changes the website to make error reporting possible in the future, then I would revise my rating upward."
3,oxford Dictionary almost,This dictionary is the heaviest I've ever owned. The disappointment comes with no Geographic locations or Biographic names. I have to use my little paperback for that reference material. It has a lot of historical entymological information that I find rather useless. The details or descriptions of words use entirely to many useless articles that add neither information or save pages.
3,Wish it was available on Kindle!,"This is a great product; however, I have been waiting since Christmas to get this on Kindle and it is STILL not available! It can't be that hard.."
1,It was okay,It was settle and a little boring. next time some pictures would be nice okay??? bye and remember to add pictures
3,Amazing,I like this book beacause it gives a lot of infermation I would recamen this book to everyone I love it p.s I'm 9
3,User friendly,Easy to use and very handy. Information included is very useful for the reader. Makes reading the books more meaningful
2,Aw some to help you understand words-it is the best dictionary by far,"I love having this book i‘m not the best speller so this helps me Wright different things for say reports or a book might have some words that you do not understand and u have this right hear in your kindle fire hd!!""!!!"

1,Michael Jordan,I chose this rating because I don't like this book.I would not recommend this book to anyone unless you like dictionaries. I'm probably not going to read this book again.
5,The new Oxford American dictionary,"I chose this rating because I liked the book. I think it's a really good resource for kids in high school with English classes that have work to do with vocabulary and root words. So, I would recommend this book to those kids."
4,Navarrio,The New Oxford American Dictionary is so great that it has sold millions of copies worldwide. It also has all words from A-Z
4,Great to have at your fingertips!,It's always great to have a resource such as this handy. It makes for a great companion just at your fingertips.
2,The New Oxford American Dictionary Review,It was very useful and I could learn new things and words and how to pronounce them. I love this dictionary and that's why I reviewed it with two stars.
5,it is a very good book it tells you all the words a person needs to know,I liked it because it helped me communicate.It helped me with my speech and to know what people say if they say humungus words
5,Ausome,Ausome as awsomeness awesome radiccal cool as books well dictionarys can totally gey in the un/it ed states of america
4,Oxford rocks!!!!!,this book helps w/ homework and etc. it not confusing at all it the easy way to learn new things

5,Really useful,"Couldn't find the Kindle one to review so I'm putting it here. This comes on your Kindle and believe it or not, it's really useful. What a great freebie. If you haven't yet, try it."
5,The best dictionary,It is a good dictionary for looking up the meaning of a word it is easy to use and easy to read and understand.
5,How boring but then good to jave,This book is so boring and at the same time it is good to have when you don't know a word and need to know what it means and I thin in this is why it is so boring so I would get the book
1,Poop,PoopIt's a dictionary it's about as good as a dictionary is gonna get an f2f plus its extremely hard to find stuff
1,A title of life,I think that if someone who is wanting something accurate to say or do that they should read THE NEW OXFORD AMERICAN DICTIONARY
3,Okay,This book was very confusing but helpful in way. That is why I choose this rating. I would recommend this book to people who like to read and people doing essays.
1,WHAT,WHY WOULD READ THIS I'M 9 AND WENT TO THE END OF THE BOOK AND I COULDN'T FIND WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR
4,AS COMPARED TO MERRIAM WEBSTER,"I found it inclusive. Anything I could think of. it had ...for the most part. I would recommend that everyone should have an online dictionary.I think phones should come with one version of the dictionary already loaded on them. I mean, even free phones.. Everyone needs to have access to a good dictionary when sending out texts or mailings."
1,What a dumb book...!!!&#12288;&#20304;&#28006;&#12288;b&#12361;&#12387;&#31062;,This is the most informative dictionary I've ever read. Why it's even more interesting than the Webster Dictionaries... I love the fact that it has it's share of modern words but alas it doesn't have enough.
4,A little on the heavy side,This dictionary is a bit heavy - it could be used for some weight training - but I can read the entries easily and it appears to be up to date.
2,Bored to death,I cross my heart if I lie I wish to die this took me concrete to read omg very stupid and plus I loved how it end so good

1,The New Oxford American Dictionary,I hate this book so much more than a story book. That is why I rated this book so low that is why It is terrible..
1,The amazing book,This book teaches people so many things that are so important and people don't even care about it.That kind of stuff makes me so mad.thank you for reading this article.
1,This sucks,No stars pooo pool poo poop poo poo poop this is super bad ha ha thiz sucz really bad it stinks like farts
1,Boring,I think it would've been better if you added pictures to demonstrate different words!!!! You didn‘t give the part of speech!!!!
3,Not terrible...,"It's just a dictionary! There is nothing exceptionally wrong with it except for the fact that I can never get to the Z section. Does anyone know the word antidisestablishmentarianisim is in the dictionary? It would be ever so kind for you to reply! (Yes, I am British)"
5,Just got done reading this book,Loved it perfect for everyone bst of all was free for me... good for scrabble word challenges so get it

1,Is this really a dictionary or is it an information book?,This book is all information about a dictionary. Are they stupid? This is not a dictionary it is an informational text. Not a dictionary. I would complain to that company for making a book about a dictionary & calling it a dictionary. Seriously calling a book about a dictionary a dictionary. Who does that? Oh wait it's the people who made this book.Yes I am complaining about this book. Next time this company needs to put some words and definitions to those words.I`m 12 almost 13 and I know the difference between a dictionary and an informational book about a dictionary. I may need reading glasses but I know how to tell what types of books without reading it the title with my reading glasses. I would advise you people who make this book do something to make this book a dictionary.
2,Not so good,This dictionary wasn't as good as I thought it would be and I didn't get what I needed to learn
2,Not a good substitute for the original,"I wish it had letter tabs, so I can get the letter of the word I'm looking for faster. That would make owning a kindle version worth it."
1,Awesome,Hey I love the dictionary it more me feel that I know everything from A to x .thank you for everything. At my school there are dictionaries but you are my favourite.
1,Emily Tonket,This was to hard for me to use. I would rather use a real book instead of this app. Horrible.
5,This is a good book to look up stuff and read,This a good book that l like to read and look up word and it help me what I need to look up and what ever letter from the first to the last of it
3,Provides all information necessary for school and at home.,"My rating for this book is neutral because although it is a good book,I would recommend it to someone else. I am more into the action and fantasy genres."
1,I think it is a good book,I would like to recommend this book to my brother because it seems like a good book.And thank you for a good book
1,The new Oxford American dictionary,Sucks boo fire dumb scrappy.sit down and watch the movie band and watch them to the movie band and a kindle fire dumb enough yay
3,this book is about ever thing and its meaning,My rating is a 99 because i learn some thing in this book i would best choose this book to be in a book store and not just in a library because it needs to be a best seller book and it is not just great it is the best in my family and i sm in love with it .
4,My summer,"I pick four case cause its a good book but ant really I book I would read and read again. And then after I read this book I sat down and thought about the book a lot! So and also after I read it I would really would that book again and like it cause I mean don't get me wrong I like this book but you know I thank it really, want for me!!!!!!

1,Boring,I hate this book I'm going to delete this book because it's so so so boring I don't think that people would read this
3,A various amount of words,My summery of this book is a various amount of words and the reason I picked this book is because I thought it looked like a good book and I would recommend it to Summer .....I thought it looked good I think its boring
3,Navigation,When you are looking for a certain word you have to know the exact page it is on or flip through all the pages to get to the word.
4,My review about your dictionary I'm 8 yrs old,That book is so big that I can barely even get out of it. But it is still useful in a way. I have a kindle fire and on that kindle tablet I just saw two random dictionaries in my book category and I got emotional. I was happy and mad. I had thought someone else put them on there but no way my brother or anyone else (mostly just my brother) would not do that. Maybe they were already on there. By the way I got my kindle for Christmas :D

1,haven't used the dictionary yet,They asked me to review the book before I get the chance of using it so I don't much to say.

3,OK Service,"I thought that this dictionary was ok . I wish that you could be able to have looked up a specific word so it would make things easier. But I did like how the dictionary was clear enough so you would be able to read all the words. I would recommend this dictionary to all those hearty readers out their and I would also recommend this book to older people because the lettering was large enough so they would be able to understand but also make sure and see what the are doing but also be able to read and see the letters. I also do think that mostly all people would like it because it can teach you a lot of valuable things . Such as teaching a child how look uncertain word in the dictionary,and this could eventually lead to help your child be a better student towards others and it could lead to your student having a better education and future."

Slang like ""hodad"" or ""hodaddy"". I'm disappointed that many common usage words are not in there. I look them up in Webster and they are there. I thought this was the ""master"" dictionary.????"

3,Oxford dictionary,"No search page or table of contents ,I was not pleased by this dictionary. Plus I couldn't understand most things it said."
4,The Somewhat Complex Dictionary,"I chose this rating because it could have been more informational. The dictionaries we have at my middle school is a little more informational for me, than this. But I have to give it props it was pretty good, it had stuff I would have never had known without reading this dictionary. So that's why I gave it a 4 star rating. Don't let me get to you I'm just trying to help.Only why I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because take it to the next level, or even the next 3 levels! The sky is the limit,and don't go up to the sky and quit, but go beyond the sky. Do that, and then, but only then, will you have your 5 star rating."
1,Where the ?,Not user friendly. It wouldn't allow me to enter the letter of the word I wanted to search. Had to slide to find word never found word to bothersome for me.
1,Sucked,It doesn't let me type in the word that I want and need to go to. Instead it makes me go through the whole dictionary before I can find the word that I need.

3,What I learned by reading this dictionary,I give this book on a scale from 1-5 a 3because I thought it had a little too much details and maybe it was hard for me too understand. I would recommend this book too somebody who likes to read and like to see a lot of words on a page. Honestly I would not like too read a book that has more words than this book does. So that's what I think about this book on a scale and as far as recommendation. I truly believe that the person that made this book spent a lot of time on it. I know it had to be frustrating. I know the person that made it spent a lot of money.
5,Good Job,I love the new version it's so easy to use the new features. It's so awesome that they have it all upgraded and that they have added new and cool stuff to it.
2,It was okay i guess,it was quite interesting to a certain degree. it was really hard to keep my focus solely on the book . all in all it was okay i guess. well that all.
1,Bullshift,You have to surf through pages for way too long on a kindle when you much easier could look it up later it'd be nice if it had a search function but otherwise it blows donkey clock for pennies

2,Received wrong order,"I ordered Ultima II ultimate coverage makeup in color Tuscan Beige. I was sent a color that is too, too light for me that I cannot use. I have ordered this makeup from you before and always received the correct order, both Tuscan Beige and Aurora Beige. Why was I sent a substitute instead of just letting me know you were out of what I ordered? I would hesitate to order anything in the future because of paying for something that I cannot use and do not want."
5,"Ultima II is the ""Ultimate Make-Up!""",I love this Ultima II Make-Up product and see it is becoming extinct! I CSM not believe more consumers are not aware of the quality of this make-up. I hope the manufacturer wil review their decision to discontinue this product! I was very pleased with the service of the Amazon provider I dealt with! Hopefully a lot more in the future.
1,Not Worth It,"We have had this phone for a couple of years and for the most part the phone worked but the caller ID screen started losing pixels after about a year and is now illegible. The funny thing is it happened on all the phones (3) at roughly the same time, and at the same rate. Now it is just annoying. We are not rough with the phone and keep in on the charger most of the time. I would not recommend this product."
1,How is anyone givng this a good review?,"I have owned this GE 5.8 GHz cordless for 1 year and I can't stand it any longer. I will throw away the whole set and buy another brand. Reception is bad in the same room, non-existent more than 20 yards from the house. Speaker phone is barely usable, due to the AGC cutting in and out. The electronic voice on the answering machine is so ""electronic"" that I can't understand half of what it's saying, regarding message number, or time readback.My only question is ""how does anyone honestly give this a 4 or 5 star review"", unless they have some other motive? Now really!"
5,"Excellent Product and Services, I love me phone","It is a product is very good, has good sign and is listened very well."
4,Very pleased,"My mom bought this phone on my recommendation and I am now buying one of my own because I liked it so much. This phone is much better than its counterpart the Edge, which is one word HORRIBLE! The Edge is a little less but not in anyway worth your $ or a bargain."
4,Great phone until batteries die,"Ok, so here's the thing. These are great phones. I bought them two years ago and then immediately bought two more of the ""extension"" phones that don't actually require a phone jack. They do everything they claim to. Clear calls, no interference, and you can walk throughout the house no problem. However, after about two years the batteries in all of them are starting to no longer hold a charge. You can use the speakerphone for about 5 minutes before you get a low battery notice and talk time is about 20-25 minutes until the same thing happens. I looked into replacing these batteries but it was about $20 per phone which made it cost prohibitive. So now we're getting new phones and I cringe thinking I'm going to have to just throw these out because other than the battery thing they work great."
4,Extra features,"Con: Either I've got housemates who keep forgetting to put handsets back in the cradle, or the battery life is markedly declining after a year of use.Pro: Works great, good range, lots of features. Speakerphone? Cool. Intercom? Can be handy. Room monitor? Awesome when the baby arrived."
1,Terrible. No one could hear.,"I purchased this phone to replace our old handsets in our kitchen and living room. However, I too had the same problem with no one being able to hear me. It was terrible. Even when I was talking loudly into the microphone no one could hear or understand me on the other end. Yet it was so loud on my end that it blew out my ear. Very disappointed in GE. They could have done much better."
2,Messy and Silly!,"My daughter has always wanted a ""Barbie Head"" and this looked like a neat alternative. I just threw toy away after I watched the stained and smeared head sit unused for months. The make up is hard to get off the face and out of the hair. The red blush or paint or whatever it was, streaked and stained the arms, cheeks and hair of this doll. Yuck!"
3,Bratz Fan,My 5 year old niece received as a christmas gift and was ecstatic. This is one of her favorite dolls to play with. The only complaint she has is that if hair is brushed hard hair loosens easily.
4,No more makeovers for me.,"Now my niece gets to makeover this doll instead of me! Thank goodness... I really think it's cute, there are enough make up options to keep them busy for a while. They can play with her long, wavy hair and do whatever they want with it(better than offering up your own head of hair-believe me.) I got this at a good price, while amazon was offering it. It looks like it went back to normal again. But a good toy for girls who like to play with make up and experiment with your hair..."
4,For your money!,"This DVD is definitely worth getting, in fact it probably is the best DVD for instruction on Western Swing that there is.As far as that goes it gets a 5 out of 5. It comes with a nice 20 page book that has many good examples. You will have several good tunes and a basketful of licks to use, plus a good introduction to the so called, Western-Swing"" genre.Ray Benson's presentation, is sincere and warm.I'd like to see a ""Part 2"" get released where an in depth theory of chord substitution is the emphasis. That would be a DVD for people that would want to go that deep into music theory, it would be great.This DVD is great and an excellent buy, especially when you look at how much education you are getting for your money! A definite 9.5 out of 10"
5,Recommended,"The source for Western Swing guitar. It's recommended by many guitarists I know, so I decided to give it a spin."
1,A DISSAPOINTMENT I COULDNT READ THE BACK COVER,i am interested in this book but i would like to read the back cover to see if its what i am looking for
4,good resource,"Looking for a ""cell block"" eye view of Texas prisons, then this book is a good resource. The author worked his way up from Correctional Officer in the ""plantation prison"" era to Warden in the contemporary era of corrections. Along the way, he experienced all of the hazards, brotherhood and politics that a career in corrections can bring you. He does not let back on his opinions about Texas prisons in particular and American prisons in general. It's a good read and historical resource and I would recommend it to anyone in the corrections field or interested in the subject."
3,Value performance from value item,"It's a cheap little thing and acts like a cheap little thing. Hard plastic makes it uncomfortable in your ear after a little while. I keep forgetting there's an answer/hangup button on it, so I keep ending calls - but I'll get used to that. At first, it had lots of static from where the headset meets the phone, but that has seemed to magically disappeared.It's good for the price, just too bad Amazon uses the shipping company they do."
4,LOVE THE SMELL,THIS PERFUME IS GREAT. I LOVE THE SMELL AND IT WAS A VERY GOOD DEAL. IT WAS A GIFT FOR MY BIRTHDAY AND I ENJOY IT. THANKS
3,A pretty and pleasant scent,"This is a perfume that has many undertones, vanilla, woodsy, etc... It is very feminine yet a bit deep at the same time. I recieved this as a sample vial with another perfume purchase, (Samsara.) It's not too bad, although it doesn't rank with my favorites, which include Dior Poison, J' adore, and Samsara."
5,The Revolution,"Best history of the Revolution I have seen or read. I had no idea how many courageous people had to come together at the precise time and place in our history to pull off a most improbable accomplishment, the establishment of the United States of America."
5,Great history presentation,"If you love the history as I do, you will love this Video. I love the history of the United States and this shows what great people that formed this nation. The people of the United States can be greatful for the wonderful people that founded the nation and it also shows how luck had a lot to do with the founding. The US is the greatest nation in the world and from the video, you can see how unique it was founded."
5,Awesome!,"I have watched these DVD's several times and each time I sit in awe and wonder for the sacrifices made by the first Americans and the founding Fathers, especially George Washington, for the independence of our country from England.I look at the USA today, and wonder how many would be willing to give up all they did for our country. All the lives lost in the Continental Army, the struggles, the battles lost and won, the hardships they faced, are unbelievable, as we have so much today. Our problems today, are so few, compared to what they faced.These are beautiful DVD's and so realistic. I just live out the scenes with the actors, as the Revolution of our country is certainly on display in the scenes of the well produced movie.I think every American needs to see these DVD's so they will have such an insight into the sacrifices that were made for the country we have today.All I say, they is awesome, fantastic!RaynaRenee"
3,review of prior program = 50% of next program - s/b 2 DVD's,"The second DVD contains review of the first DVD and each subsequent DVD contains expanded review of prior DVDs. The whole program should have been condensed to 2 DVDs. I planned to share the program with my grandchildren, but I think they will fall asleep watching the repeated comments, I did."
3,"Great Idea, Great Production....Awful DVD Quality","I was excited to order this 13 part series after catching part of it on the History Channel. Upon receiving it however and watching the 1st installment, my personal opinion is that the video quality and DVD production is very poor. I don't understand why they would shoot this is widescreen but show it in a funky letterbox type aspect. There are white dotted lines across the top of the screen that are very distracting. For those of you who understand video, I would rate this about the quality of a VCD. The sound is okay. While I would have given this series 5 stars, the poor quality of the DVD brings the purchase down to a 3 for me. Note to History Channel: Upgrade your technology."
3,Slightly lefty,"Generally informative, but terribly slanders George Washington, claiming he was overly ambitious and deceptive - pretending not to be ambitious to hide his being secretly ambitious. His well-known attempts to cultivate his own character, such as his rules of conduct, are dismissed as tools of ambition. It is an accusation born of the secular historian's insistence that all actors be motivated by selfishness, and not much else, the same hobbled mindset that still cannot comprehend that England ended the slave trade, committing economic suicide, because of Christianity.His humility is, however, evinced by his life, words and conduct, including his refusal to stay on another term as President, and these pointy-headed critics are not fit to lick his boots. And they know it, thus their repeated attempts at slander. At least, that's my theory. I could be wrong.A sad blot on this series, which is an otherwise good introduction to the Revolution."
3,shame on the History Channel,"The main problem I have with this documentary is the following:I believe the History Channel should be ashamed of themselves for portraying George Washington as an ambitious, calculating and even incompetent man. Where much documentation exists of people testifying to Washington's humility and general desire to be a Virginian farmer as opposed to a politician, they dismiss this... even insinuate that his ""pretended"" sense of duty was some great plan for military and political ambition. They mentioned nothing of his connection to ""Providence""... how he prayed regularly- and was seen so doing- nor how he insisted that his men prayed also. They've taken a humble, great man and tried to turn him into something completely different. If you'd like a true picture of this wonderful, God-inspired man, please read the following book:The Real George Washington (American Classic Series).Secondly, the discs have a tendency to freeze; so they are not of the highest quality."
2,Poor Quality,"This documentary is poor quality, and it is exhaustingly repetitive. This 10 hour documentary is actually only about two hours worth of film footage repeated over and over again. I generally enjoy documentaries regarding American history, but this one wore me out!"
3,Important Topic,"Ross Gelbspan's Boiling Point covers an extremely important topic, global warming. Unfortunately, this book is an extremely dry read."
4,Enviro-skeptics are barbarians at the gate!,"Better than your usual global warming book..and there a lot of good ones..(this is one of my favorite genres so to speak). Yes..this is a little more interesting. While it speaks about the science, there is more needed analysis of the ""debate"" and politics of this pressing and vast subject as well a very much needed scathing indictment of the American press' approach to the subject. The author offers some breathtaking solutions to this problem that could really make for a great new world. If only. If only. I'll mail a copy to the next president. Now..if only someone would write a whole book about how science is too dangerous (biotechnology excepted of course) for America as it threatens to make Americans think and challenge the status quo. Espcially at this point in our history. The Vatican once had America's attitude about science."
4,Re: Boiling Point,"It's always good to come across some whole truth on this topic, considering how much misinformation and half-truth we see on the web and even in the media. Many people are quick to accept, without further research, things like petitions on climate change, claims that the Arctic (or the globe) is actually cooling, or that we shouldn't be concerned because climate change has happened in the past (which ignores the nature of the current trend - something unseen since a highly volcanic prehistory). Books like this, along with sites like GlobalWarmingTruth.org and RealClimate.org, provide the ""rest of the story"" and help people understand they're being bamboozled.Although the book is a little strong on rhetoric in places, I like it's discussion of potential solutions, and the way it encourages people to consider the source of contrarian claims. If it's not firmly rooted in peer-reviewed science, get out the salt."
1,Skewed Writing,"I borrowed this book from a friend and to tell you the truth I did not read much of it but read the highlights. This type of writing is totally inaccurate and not supported by factual information and yet many readers think they read the truth.The climate has always been changing and will always continue to change. It is really arrogant of man to think he can do anything about it. Fact is on a long range trend the world is cooling, not warming. There are always peaks and valleys in the trend line.I live in Kansas and millions of years ago this was a tropical land following being under water and sea, the gulf came clear up here and we had dinasaurs and all kinds of tropical vegetation. Today we have farm land and moderate climate. The trend has been one of cooling, not warming up. The liberal writer is nuts. Frankly it is written with out common sense. Poor book."
3,WHERE'S THE AMERICAN LEAGUE???,"This should be titled ""When it was a game in the National League"". Far too much footage of the senior circuit, albeit excellent footage. Otherwise very well done like the previous 2 films, the part about bat day and baseball cards will evoke smiles from the 30-50 year old range of fans. Bob Costas and Billy Crystal offer their usual fine perspectives, much like in Ken Burn's ""Baseball"". Great shots of the old stadiums, especially Yankee Stadium and Candlestick Park. Reasonably priced DVD, worthy for your collection."
3,"Although I'll admit that I haven't seen the first in the series, I was instantly amazed and impressed.","The program itself is a very fine one, and die-hard fans of baseball history will enjoy it quite a bit. 3 stars"
2,"THIS IS NOT A ""DVD""","This is a ""Music"" DVD...meaning you get music with a still picture to look at while you listen. The music is good...as long as you turn the video screen off and forget it's supposed to be a ""DVD."""
4,A good deal,The fit is exactly what it says on the label. No weird spiral leg seams nor a crutch somewhere round the knees.I have paid a lot more and got all the problems I just said these jeans dont have.My only complaint (if you can call it that) is the colour. But hey I chose it right?All in all a good buy and I shall go for more!
3,Just for fun,"These are beautiful, fun, cards. I bought them for my collection, but I do not read with them due to the inaccuracies (unless I am in a very whimsical mood).My major complaint -> The cards all have naked women and hardly any naked men. I find this highly unfair :-). This redblooded female would like to see a deck with more ...(ummm, I am not going to finish that sentance)."
2,manara erotic tarot,"It's pretty tame, and definitely geared to almost only renditions of the female body. I am a hetero-woman and would have preferred more (Quantity) erotic depictions of the male, sexually aroused. I'm going to sell it on ebay tho I notice there are a lot of the Manara decks listed on it already . . ."
5,The Space Almanac is the ultimate reference source.,"The Space Almanac should be rated a 100,000 star book. It has info on everything space and astronomy related."
5,Unforgettable!,"Was President Nixon gay? Author Jason Fury poses that question in this unforgettable love/murder story of an unforgettable gay hero: Kurt James. Kurt is hired to work as tutor/secretary in the fabulous Darling Mansion on Fifth Avenue in l973. His boss is gorgeous David Darling, the rumored boyfriend of President Nixon. David's wife is the feminist psycho, Mona. Kurt falls in love with not only David but his hunky son, Claude. There's a shocking murder in Darling Place, President Nixon's rumored gay affair comes to life, he leaves office. A haunting ending.Based on fact, says the author. You won't forget this one!"
1,Not the best of what is available,"While early in the planning stages for a recent trip to Zambia, I purchased the Zambia & Victoria Falls Travel Map bundled with International Travel Map's Zambia Map; I also purchased Chris McIntyre's Bradt Zambia Guide. I quickly abandoned this insufficiently detailed map as it offered nothing that was not provided by the other map or McIntyre's book.This map is unnecessary given those other resources. I recommend setting aside the money that you would have spent on this map and spending it in Livingstone on some beautiful curios."
1,BEWARE!!!(...) You don't need this headache!!!!,"What a joke this ""appliance"" is. We purchased one of these for my grandmother as a Christmas gift last year. It worked for about 2 weeks, then quit. She boxed it up and they sent her another, which worked for about a month. To make a long story short, she is now on number 10!!!!! She wants to send it back for good and just get a computer, but, of course, she is locked into another 2 years of MSN service. Knowing the trouble and headaches she's been through, I would NEVER recommend this product to anyone. I wanted to warn you to STAY AWAY!! P.S. If I could have given it 0 stars, I would have."
2,THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE YOU BUY!,"You need to have a high amount of tollerance and patience if you decide to become the owner of one of these things.We're constantly getting kicked off line,the thing constantly gets stuck;you have to reset it and you have to refind the web page you were previously on.If you can afford it just get a REAL COMPUTER.There is a reason there's a THREE YEAR WARRANTY,the only way I would use MSN Internet Services;is to get it for the free trial period.GO WITH AT&T WORLDNET,the fee you have to pay to use a seperate ISP is worth it,just as long as you don't have to use MSN; IT'S WON AWARDS ALRIGHT,FOR BEING THE WORLD'S WORST INTERNET PROVIDER! PLEASE THINK,RETHINK,AND TRIPLE THINK BEFORE YOU PURCHASE ONE OF THESE THINGS.If you really need to get on the internet and this is all you can afford,like me;then this is the best option out there...JUST THINK BEFORE YOU BUY!"
1,Do not buy this,"I just got the so called Compaq Internet appliance and it is really terrible. It took me literally hours even to get it to connect and sign up, which required me to page through a truly idiotic introduction to the Internet over and over again because it doesn't go away until you successfully connect. Once you are connected, it is slow and cumbersome. I assume most people would only want this for Internet novices. They will find it confusing and frustrating. The wireless keyboard has to be so close it might was well be wired. This thing is a turkey."
1,"Nice machine, faulty subscriber service","My 79-year old mother purchased this internet appliance, and was at first delighted with its small size and flat-panel monitor. The trouble began the first day when we signed up for the required Microsoft Network service. We could send email, but could not receive it. We called the tech desk, and they said they could fix the problem. Nothing happened. We called again two days later, then called again. A month has now passed. We have made more than 20 telephone calls to MSN technical support. The first-level support always says the problem is in an MSN router, and they ""escalate"" the problem to a second-level technician. The second-level has not or will not cure the problem, nor have they contacted us. There are no other numbers we can call, and no one else to contact. We are at a dead end. We are now going to ship the machine back and cancel the service. I have never--not once in my life--experienced such frustrating and poor service."
4,good,the only thing left out of your product is a manual for the compaq ipaq ia-1 home internet appliance were can we get a owners manual or a contact link to this product.
1,We got a defective pottery wheel,"This toy worked for about 15 minutes...tops. On the upside, Highlights seems to be willing to give me a full refund."
5,Christopher the Christmas Tree,A few days ago i bought Christopher The Christmas Tree because it was a movie i saw when i was a kid and luckily Geneva Marketing had it and i just got today and it was in amazing condition like freshly bought and still had the old vhs smell like when you first open it so im very pleased and i just got done watching it so now my kids will watch it one day thank you very much Geneva Marketing :).im a be a future buyer from this company when/if i find eny thing else they have in stock
2,Unnecessary ingredients,There are so many ingredients in here that I'm not sure what wasn't agreeing with me. All I know is that I have noticeable and unique effects when I consume soy (which I no longer do on purpose) and these vitamins caused the same effect. Do they have soy in them? Not sure which ingredient might have caused me tongue numbness/swelling by I quit taking them as a result.
3,I expect results.,"ing a medicine, always think of having quick results, but it is possible to achieve them quickly. I'm drinking one pills per day and not three, as they have side effects like pimples on the face, so I think it lasts over to see results."
1,TRY SOMETHING ELSE!,"TOOK AS DIRECTED AND FINISHED THE ENTIRE BOTTLE...NOTHING HAPPENED FOR MY NAILS, HAIR OR SKIN! I STOMACHED SWALLOWING THESE GIGANTIC SIZED PILLS THAT ALWAYS SCRAPPED MY THROAT ON THE WAY DOWN HOPING IT WOULD WORK BUT NO, NOTHING. I THINK MOST OF THOSE POSITIVE REVIEWS ARE FAKE AND THEY WERE PAID TO WRITE THEM IF THE COMPANY DIDN'T WRITE THEM THEIRSELVES. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, BUY SOMETHING ELSE!"
4,ok,"i liked the product cant tell if they really worked any wonders for my hair and nails, because there was only a month supply in the bottle and i have yet to purchase another, but it couldnt hurt so i decided to take a chance on them"
2,Not as I expected but it'll do,"I thought this bathrobe would be more absorbent and I dident know the sleeves were long but it is big and has alot of space like the robe really wraps around you, I was choosing between this robe and the ""Mens and Womens Deluxe Style Heavy 24 oz. Luxury 100% Turkish Terry Cotton Shawl Collar White Spa Bathrobe"" and went with this one because it was cheaper well next time ill order the more expensive one next time but this one is alright ....'"
3,ALITTLE DISAPPOINTED!,"ALTHOUGH THE ROBE WAS DELIVERED ON TIME, (GREAT SERVICE), I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THE ITEM ITSELF. IT WAS NOT WHAT WAS IN THE PICTURE AND IT WASN'T AS WHITE AS I EXPECTED. IT SEEMED TO BE A BIT DINGY OR DIRTY. I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO THOUGHT SO; I ASKED SOMEONE ELSE WHAT THEY THOUGHT AND THEY SAID THE SAME THING. I DID NOT OPEN THE ROBE UP ALL THE WAY BUT I STILL NOTICED SOME LOOSE THREADS AROUND THE COLLAR AND SLEEVES.THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A GIFT FOR SOMEONE. NOT TOO HAPPY!!!"
5,Mens & Womens XXL White Terry Bathrobe,"I got this robe for my disabled sister. She absolutely loves it. She said it fits perfect, roomy, soft, not too short and she doesn't want to take it off... Since we live so far apart, my sister said every time she puts on her robe, it's like a great big hug from me...Thank you for making my sister happy. Juanita Haskins"
2,Not the best,This is what was promised and the size is good but the belt loop was not sewed on when it arrived. It works fine. Not flimsy not robust.
1,not 18 inches,"Don't be fooled by the description. These pillow inserts were suggested to go along with an 18 inch pillow cover--don't delude yourself--they are 15 inches--or as some critques say 16 inches--a stretch. Very poor advertising--literally a ""sham"". A waste of your money--don't buy them if you want an 18 inch pillow insert. Will never buy from this company again."
1,Awful! not good for stuffing! very soft and poor quality,Awful! the quality is so bad. I never write reviews but this was so bad I had too. I was shocked Amazon would allow these to sell on their website.
5,VERY full!,"These pillow inserts are GREAT. I bought them to replace some older inserts that had fallen flat. I paid about half the price for the older ones and it showed. They are soooo full and the stuffing is very substantial. They haven't fallen at all and my husband and kids both use them when they're watching TV, so they're not just sitting around as decor. I highly recommend."
5,pillow stuffer,"this worked very good in the decorative sham I bought and makes the pillow look great, just what I needed"
1,No redeeming value,I bought this book to read on a trip to Italy. It is so painfully amateurish that I could not get beyond the second chapter. I have tried to read it a few times since I have been home and find it impossible.Do not waste your money!
5,Why pay book store prices!,This is the first time I have even thought of ordering my Sons college books on line. Typical busy parent I ordered the books at the book store on campus and picked them up. After seeing the exact same book on Amaaon for $50.00 less I was very happy.I ordered the book and it arrived in quick time and in perfect condition. Days of throwing cash away are gone. Amazon Thank You!
3,On the fence with this one,"This book presents itself in a professional manner, but my copy had many typos in it which I found distracting. What I liked most was the collection of art throughout the book. I didn't really get anything out of the book, but perhaps a 2nd reading might change my opinion."
3,Good compilation but too many typographical errors,This book would be wonderful if the editor had done a great job of fixing all the typographical errors. I lost concentration and kept correcting typing mistakes ...very unprofessional...makes you wonder who is teaching me...otherwise a good help
3,"Quick Shipping, Silent Seller","This book was affordable, and it shipped very quickly. Unfortunately, I soon discovered I needed to return it, and contacted the seller about his policy. He never responded, even after I emailed a second time. I was stuck with the book, and plan to resell it myself."
3,Good book for starting any graphic project,I enjoyed the variety in this book - always a great way to start organizing your thinking about creative options. No book will solve all the design needs of an assignment but this book explores some good results from other designers.
5,Porter & Dolly,"Porter Wagoner & Dolly Parton - 20 Greatest Hits, is one of the best I have heard, it has all great songs. Porter and Dolly are one of the finest duet couples in country music and this recording of their 20 greatest hits will attest to it."
5,Heard it when I was 10 years of age,"In a town called Magoye in Zambia, Central Africa my sister returned with these songs to teach us these songs whenever she was on her school holidays. I learnt to sing these songs even before I heard them play. These songs bring real memories of my childhood in the mid 70s as I was growing us."
5,A great compilation,"This album is a great introduction to one of the greatest musical groups ever. Queenryche's best really can't be contained on just one album, but this is a good start. The older songs are remastered, and sound great. The 2 bonus tracks are a nice addition."
3,the omission,"I've never been a monster Queensryche fan, though some of their songs really blow me away. It doesn't surprise me that my favorite QR song, ""The Mission,"" is not included since it didn't receive airplay. In fairness, it's difficult to produce a QR GH package because the concept alblum ""Mindcrime"" was HUGE, and all the songs off that CD are so tightly tied to each other. The omission of ""Another Rainy Night(without you)"" is pretty glaring, but then again, isn't that how they keep us buying the original albums?"
4,And Waiting for Promised Land...,"Owning all Ryche's albums, I only bought this to take advantage of the Promised Land Game voucher that is included with the disk (you pay shipping & handling only).As for the CD itself, it's a sampling not unlike Rush's ""Chronicles"". It's a nice-to-have, but the choice in tracks is less than perfect. Where is ""Promised Land"" or ""Damaged""? How about ""Anybody Listening?"" or ""Anarchy-X/Revolution Calling""?The digital remastering of the older stuff is great though."
5,Greatest Hits is Awesome!,"The Greatest Hits album by Queensryche is absolutely awesome. It combines all the per se ""hits"" off all of Queensryche albums. From Queen of the Reich, to Walk in the Shadows, to Empire and I am I. They also threw in a couple of previously unreleased tracks which are mindblowing. It is so cool to hear songs that were on previous albums blend in with songs that were on later albums. This is a great opportunity to see how Queensryche has progressed over the years. It's truly remarkable.It's a must have."
4,"Good compilation, but needs more...","All the songs here are good, but like a great many ""Best Of"" sets, there is a lot missing that should be included. Like Van Halen, Ozzy Osbourne, Bruce Springsteen, Fleetwood Mac, etc, you just can't get the essential songs on one disc. It's impossible. Let's hope that a ""Volume 2"" will soon be in the works. Here are some suggestions for the next one: 1.)Revolution Calling 2.)Speak 3.)Another Rainy Night 4.)Best I Can 5.)Anybody Listening? 6.)Road to Madness 7.)Gonna Get Close to You 8.)I Will Remember 9.)Prophecy 10.)Last Time in Paris 11.)Scarborough Fair 12.)Real World 13.)Disconnected 14.)Lady Jane 15.)Cuckoos Nest 16.)Spool"
3,Queensryche,Great service thank you. Queensryche -Greatest hits music was ok .If you heard one you heard them all But over all it was good
4,what?,what ever happened to operation mindcrime and breaking the silence? Two of the best songs on Operation Mindcrime(awesome by the way).
4,"powerful, but a bit tedious at times","Queensryche was one of the top prog metal bands ever. They mixed heavy metal fury with progressive, intelligent melodies. That's where it gets tedious. Metal is supposed to be wild, obnoxious idiot music. Instead, Queensryche carved highly intelligent, thinking-guy's music. That kind of rubs me the wrong way. But Queensryche is a good band. They still 'rock out' at times, and some of their songs are some of my favorites. But this is not the true definition of metal. Go get some Iron Maiden or Ozzy if you want to hear idiot music(also known as metal)."
3,Hair Metal that doesn't Suck,"Queensryche, a Seattle band that sounds like a mixture of hair metal and Hard rock, while they have roots to Seattle grunge scene. Queensryche is a mixed up group. Not muck to say about their music rather than it's okay."
4,"New to Queensryche? You'll Love It! But, You'll Want More.","This entry in their catalog needs another disc or two in order to fit all of Queensryche's better songs on it. I am a huge Queensryche fan, primarily because their vocalist has a tremendous set of pipes. The rest of the music is excellent to, but there is not nearly as much showmanship with the rest of the band, as with the vocalist."
5,aweaome band!,this is a must have cd for anyone that loves music.all the songs are great.anyone that gets this cd will be pleased.
4,Queensryche Rules,This CD combines the best that Queensryche can offer any true ROCK fan. The power of the EMPIRE CD rules this BEST OF CD. Keep up the great ROCK...If you like and enjoy true rock music...This will not let you down..
4,somewhat incomplete,"To really do justcie to Queesryche, this album would have to feature the entire Operation:Mindcrime disk. Mindcrime, like Pink Floyd's the Wall, or The Who's Quadrophenia, is truly meant to be enjoyed in it's entirity and to take a couple of tracks and patch them together with some other material does not do the album justice.This collection does, however, cover Queensryche's remarkably solid career. Geoff Tate has been compared to Rob Halford and Bruce Dickinson, but in my opinion, he out sings both. This compilation gives a nice chronological look at the history of one of metal's greats, but do yourself a favor, buy Operation:Mindcrime."
4,Greatest Hits from one of the Greatest Bands,"Queensryche has always been one of the finest bands of the land. This album shows the inventiveness and spirt of a band not content to put out the same old same old continuously. This records proves that you can move into new directions without losing what made your music special in the first place. This band has been described as heavy metal erroneously. The music is not one-dimensional at all. Do your record collection a favor, and buy this CD today. Everytime you listen to it, you will be assured to notice something new."
2,Disappointing.,"Despite the fact that this album includes all of my favorite Queensryche songs - ""Queen of the Reich,"" ""I Don't Believe In Love,"" ""Jet City Woman,"" ""I Dream In Infrared,"" and ""Silent Lucidity"" - I didn't think much of it. I just don't think a greatest hits album really suits the 'Ryche. Go get the debut EP, ""Operation: Mindcrime,"" and ""Empire."" More money, yes, but well worth it."
3,the ommission,"I'm not a monster Queensryche fan, but they do have some good songs, ones that really blew me away. I'm not surprised that my favorite QR song, ""The Mission,"" is missing since it didn't get airplay. Curiously, nobody seems to have mentioned the ommission of one their best songs, ""Another Rainy Night (without you)"" which was a radio hit. HMMMMMM! Realistically, it's difficult to produce a true QR GH's CD because the concept CD ""Mindcrime"" was HUGE, and all the songs off that album are tied to each other and the concept. In the words of Forrest Gump, ""That's about all I have to say about that."""
2,Hands Full,"I found the handsfree unit to be a handful. It plugs in easy enough but what do you do with the phone? You still have to hold it, dial it, and shut it off. Where does the handsfree come in. There is no holder to HOLD THE PHONE. Another hassle comes with the additional microphone that has another long cord to clutter the driving space. Also, I found the speaker quality to be unsatisfactory, especially when checking voice mail. The signal repeatedly broke up. I am in the process of returning this gift that I got from Santa, via amazon.com."
5,Rock-A-Billy Rowdy,"Just a great Rock-A-Billy disc. A must have for all you rock-a-billy fans. Jackie Cochrans T for Texas...is fantastic. A Great Album! filled with lots of good songsThe Mean Eyed CatKNON Radio 89.3Dallas, Texas"
2,"Music is fine, but the marketing is not",I can add nothing to the sensible and sensitive comments by V Staplehurst about the musical content of these Cd's but I find myself irritated by the knowledge that by judicious editing and the possible deletion of just two pieces the music could have fitted on to one CD whilst still retaining the excellence of the production. There is just 90 minutes of music in total on these two CDs. I had thought the bad old days had gone when 32jazz entered the market. In this instance I feel ECM has ripped me off.
5,The mustard seed way by Katrina Mayer,"If you desire a close personal relationship with God this is the book for you. This book provides you with steps which, if followed, can help you reach this goal. At the end of each chapter you will find what Katrina calls her ""Mustard Seed Moments"". These very poignant moments can be interpreted as HOW TO opportunities which can guide and direct you along this path. The words flow from her pen and are compelling. I read this book in one afternoon and have reread it several times since. Each reading has brought new insights and is bringing me closer to God. May it do the same for you."
5,The Mustard Seed Way is the Everyday Way,"This book is truly a breath of fresh air. Anyone can read this book and relate it to some part of their life somewhere along the way. It is for everyone, wether you just need a happy quick picker upper, or you need the tools to take that picker upper with you on the rest of your life's journey, it will take you there. It is one of the best self helpers out there! The more you read it(first time, second time etc.)the more you can take from it."
5,loved it,I plan to give this book to my daughters. I'm sure they will gain as much insight from it as did I. The mustard seed moments really made me think. Loved it Katrina!!!
4,Good Product!,"It is a good product for all people who is using cellular phone on the road. It is pretty easy to use and the instruction is also clear. It makes driving on the road a lot safer. In terms of cost, it is a really great product for its functionality."
5,An Informative fast paced read,"As a current member of the 30th Mechanized Brigade I found this book to be an extremely interesting look into the roots and history of a forgotten Division. The author provided a great deal of insight into this critical battle through the personal experiences and recollections of the actual soldiers who fought against some of the best German troops at that time. This book was very informative and details a battle that very few people had heard of, which is a shame considering what these everyday soldiers accomplished under such exteme conditions. I would highly recommend."
5,Two stories under one cover.,"Great book. I personally liked to read divisional histories, and this is in my top five. The writer takes you throught he divisions pre war history, European deployemnt, and combat history. The reader gets two stoies here, one is a history of a Army National Guard unit going to war, and the other is the Battle of Moritain, a pivital conflict in the conquest of France. I read it in a weekend, you will find it hard to put down as well."
5,The Funniest DVD I own (among stiff competition)!,"I'm a huge Conan fan but I never expected the DVD to be as hilarious as it was. A lot of the clips were a bit shorter than I expected (perhaps trying to cram so much good stuff into a small DVD), but a couple seconds into the next clip I was already too caught up to care.I own DVDs of Seinfeld, Chris Rock, Chris Tucker, Dave Chappelle and 5-6 Saturday Night Live ""Best Of"" DVDs, and Conan's 10 Year was, is, and will be the funniest out of the entire collection! (Chappelle's ""Killin' Them Softly"" is a close 2nd).Wow - I haven't laughed that hard at a movie in a long time."
5,Small but Sweet,"This is a marvelous device, great for a writer. I can work on my stories on the fly and synchronize to my laptop for editing.Containing Excel, Word, Power Point, Outlook, it is everything you can ask for in on-the-go computing.The charge lasts about 9 hours at a time; I plug it in every other night to keep it topped off, and carry it in my pocket on the subway.Lay in an extra battery if you can (before HP stops making the product - they are up to Jornada 900)"
2,Good keyboard for small children,"I really wanted to love this machine, but the love was short-lived. 20 minutes after using it, I began packing it up to send it back. My beef: the keyboard is poorly designed, both in terms of the size of the keys and their action. You should know that I was using a Psion 5 so I had very high standards in this regard. I assumed that since the 720 was about 10% bigger than the Psion that its keyboard would be bigger too...but no; it's even smaller. I also found the touch screen more less responsive than the Psion's but the resolution and colors are fanstastic.The rest of the hardware seemed well thought out, although more ""plasticky"" than I expected for the price. The software seemed very good, very much like having a miniature version of a Windows-based PC.For those who are interested, I ultimately bought a Psion NetBook and am quite happy with the decision."
4,worth the effort,"I bought this so that I would not have to always carry around my laptop (I travel quite a bit) I use the basic programs (word, exel and email/web primarily) and for these it works well ALTHOUGH getting email/web set up was quite a trial and you can only access it (at least for compuserve and my company's internal system) through terminal mode which is a hassle. The keyboard is small but so am I so while it works for me might not for someone with large hands. Also, unlike my palm VII there is very little available add on software out there yet because the StrongARM processor is still too new and most software works for the other types. Overall though...I do like it and I am happy I bought it...may bot worth quitethis price...."
4,"WOW! SO EASY, MY MINI LAPTOP","Being in Sales, client information is very important to me. With the Jornada 720 I am able to have all my clients history available. With the large LCD color screen and the use of the stylus (use as a mouse)it does not take a computer genious to work with the jornada. I am able to work on a proposal while sitting at the doctors office, then go back to my office sync it with my pc and finish where I left off. It is well worth the price, I love it, can't be without it."
4,Great little machine,"For me, this has been a great little machine. It has everything I need, including Pocket Access (which you can't get anymore). With a keyboard that works well once you get used to it, a modem, a windows platform, this little pc keeps me functioning while on the road... Much better than a PDA - this is a computer!"
3,WARNING! Jornada Accessories,"If your looking for Compact Flash cards for your Jornada 720 beware! If you search for accessories on the page will show Viking Components Compactflash cards and Modems with the impression that they are compatible with the Jornada 720. After talking with technical support at both HP and Viking Components (neither of which had a clue, these tech engineers looked at their web site, like I did), after many hours of research (on Microsoft/hp and viking sites) I am returning the Viking compact flash as the Jornada 720 could not figure out what driver to use. In fact, HP's own compactflash may not be compatible with this unit... The Jornada 720 itself works great, with the only drawback a lack of software and occasional hickups when connecting via network sync... Unless, your in a hurry to have a small unit like this, I would wait a year or two to let the technology catch up to it...If you purchase one, prepare to be ""on your own"" for the most part."
2,not a great item,It is not a great item if u just fancy a touch screen without much functionality and outdated techology
1,dont buy this if you want internet access,you will not be able to view any web pages that require the use of applets....such as any gaming site (pogo etc)
5,Beautiful soothing music. Wonderful voice!,What a lovely lullabye album! Classic songs set in beautiful arrangements. The voice is so pretty and clear. Nice for baby and mom too! I would recommend this wonderful lullabye album for any new mom and baby or toddler!
4,Rutger Hauer is a terrific Nazi,This is touted as a Sci-Fi piece but its charm is more mystery/drama. Rutger looks great in his German uniform and he gives a strong portrayal of a man who learns the truth and acts on it. I enjoyed the film. It was quite watchable. The kid in it is believable and the costumes are done perfectly for that era.
4,Interesting vid.,"This video is a reverse thinking of the ""what if concept""...sort of like an alternate reality.It shows how things might have been.I like videos that make you think & expand the horizons of thought.What would the world be like if WWII had turned out the way it did?This movie demands special attention & deep level of patience.Remember that not all those affiliated w/ the Nazi Party shared the core beliefs or were necesarily Party Members by choice.This shows part of that & that there were good meaning people."
3,An adaptation of Robert Harris's No.1 bestseller,"With such actors as Rutger Hauer, Miranda Richardson and Michael Kitchen the film had all the promise to do the book credit. Sadly it falls short. Hauer plays Xavier March, a detective in a Berlin that would have been had Hitler won the war, who stumbles on a secret that the Nazis' would rather keep quiet - namely the Final Solution. The film - based on Richard Harris's brilliant book keeps thinly to original plot and thus loses much of the excitement. Read the book and forget the film. The end especially is a disappointment."
2,Not as good as the book..,But that is usually the case. Mirianda Richardson is always fun to watch though and she does a very good job in the movie. The movie itself is a little tepid but maintains a nice atmosphere. It would have been better done as a mini series.
4,"""Fatherland"" Video Tape","The tape was in good shape from a video point of view. However, the audio was not that good. I was still able to watch the tape."
3,What novel is this based on?,"Whatever novel this is based on, it sure isn't Robert Harris's. I finished reading the novel minutes before popping in the movie and was surprised to see that the whole thing was rewritten. Hardly a sub-plot remains.On the whole it's a decent movie, though it shows its made for TV roots and the ending is laughable."
2,What happened with the story of the book?,"The introduction was excellent: images of a shamefull Eisenhower who felt responsible for not winning the war. Churchill sent in excile to Canada, King Edward en Queen Wallis, Speer's realised buildings in the Reich. The makers used authentical images to create this alternative history and they succeed: it was very convincing.For the first 30 minutes, the story was allright. The pictures of Nazi-Berlin in the sixties were impressing. But then everything went wrong. There was nothing left of the subtile and tragic plot of the book. I hardly believed my eyes and wondered what Robert Harris himself would think about the rape of his story. What drove the scenariowriters to turn an brilliant story in XXXX like this...?"
1,A Stinker,"I honestly have to say this movie STINKS! For anyone who has read the book, the plot bears no resemblance whatsoever. They even have major plot twists happening in the movie that did not occur in the book. I understand that being a HBO Original Movie, it did not have the budget to include some elements. However, they could have done a MUCH better job being faitful to the plot in the book. Wasted money."
1,Brick Hard,Harmony Gummi Bears are my favorite butThe last two shipments I got have been stale and brick hard. They were completely dried out and inedible.
2,Low quality gummi bears,"I bought a case of these from Amazon because someone on some candy forum claimed these were of ""excellent"" quality and that they were comparable to premium brands like Haribro.Don't believe it. These are cheapo gummi bears, no better than whatever cheapo junk your local drugstore/supermarket/bigbox sells. Pretty squishy (not very chewy), and a variety of bland flavors that all taste mostly like sweet.There's no point in buying these."
4,Not as nice as the others.,"My three year old daughter received this as an early Christmas present from her aunt. Although it is very cute, there's not much to it. It comes with three bobble-head dogs a ""chew toy"" and a ball. The dogs can open the door of the house when you touch their paw to the doorbell. But that's it. That's all it does. My daughter loves animals so she does play with this toy but due to the size and the limited actions, she only plays for about 5-10 minutes at a time. For the price, I don't expect much but she owns the hamster set, and it is wonderful, very cute and a couple of different things to do with it. And she'll also be getting the playhouse for Christmas (Shhhhh!!!), again, adorable and plenty to do. Overall, this is a cute addition to the set, but not alot of fun to play with by itself."
3,Solid metal release,"Some super gnarly breakdowns. Too many in fact. By that I mean, every song contains a breakdown even when not appropriate. They kinda just bust out of nowhere as though they finished writing the song and someone said ""oh! We forgot a breakdown!"" 4 or five songs on this album are classics and the rest is kinda filler. Also, the production is weak. If you love DI, you'll want this, if you just want ghetto deathcore mastery, buy day of mourning instead."
5,Absolutely crushing!,"I was really blown away recently with the return of Dino Cazares' new group's CD (Divine Heresy- 'Bleed the Fifth') but after hearing Despised Icon's newest gem, I'm torn to shreds!! This is brutal death/hardcore metal & it's nice for me as an extreme metal fan because this CD reminded me of Suffocation at their best, Broken Hope but better, & even Decapitated with their latest slice of death 'Organic Hallucinosis.' My only small complaint is I'm not a huge fan of the indecipherable death vocals (I like brutal vocals that are somewhat listenable) but other than that this CD is perfect in every way in terms of extreme metal music playing & production. Don't pass this up!"
2,not that good,"i like all shall perish. job for a cowboy, black dahlia and for some reason i do not like these guys at all. the music is okay but all they play is breakdowns. boring. there singer sucks too....too much BREE. if they do what job for a cowboy did with their latest release it might be good stuff."
5,A childhood in India early this century,"M M Kaye bought India alive for me in her two novel's ""The Far Pavillions"" and ""Shadow of the Moon"" - in her autobiography I can see where her love of India came from .She also brings to this, the first volume of her three volume autobiography, the same beautiful writing that she has used in her novels. She has a very easy and light writing style which brings her memoirs and her fiction alive. This first book takes us up to 1925 and her return to India after some time away back in England.This is for those of you who love India, love MM Kaye - (better known as Mollie by her family) or are interested in the times of India under the Raj."
5,The most definitive history of this period ever written,"I am not surprised that this book has unanimous 5 star reviews. John Treadway is a legendary figure in Balkan studies, and is quite rightly regarded as the world authority on the Montenegrin history of this period. He is uniquely able to make the study of Montenegro in the run up to World War One both scholarly and accessible, an all too rare feat in historical writing these days. Buy 10 copies of this book and give them to any historians you know to teach them how to write history properly. Christopher Catherwood, author of THE BALKANS IN WORLD WAR TWO (Palgrave, 2003)"
3,small shoe,My husband wears a 12 EEE and this shoe wasn't just a little tight he could hardly get it on. Smaller then most.
3,Size too small!,I need 12 EEEE and this shoe is definitely not that wide. I tried having them stretched. No luck. I gave these shoes to a friend because I could not even start to get them on my feet. Otherwise they are very nice shoes.
1,Shoes Complain,I ask for shoes 8 3E and the shoes I got are too small I did not know that Flosheim has reduce the size of shoes. I have being buying Florsheim for the last 30 years and it is the first time that an 8 3E is too small.
5,hard to find map,The map is a great learning tool for the kids. They help collect the coins and put them in the book. It's wonderful. Just wish I would have started the collection when the quarters first came out.
4,Gift for Aupair,"I bought the map for our aupair, she liked it and used it for her collection. The coin place holders can be be very hard to remove. I wished the quality of the product would be better."
2,Very disappointed in the quality,"I bought this for my 8 year old. Almost all the quarters she put in ended up ""sinking in"" and getting lost between the top and bottom layers. The edges are already frayed (she's only had it 1 1/2 weeks) and quite frankly it's boring! The less expensive versions have questions about the states that come with it so it's much more than just something to look at. It's size is unattactive as well. I thought since the cost was was 3 times as much as the other ones it must be better. Sadly I was mistaken! Would definitely not recommend this item."
5,Coin Collection,Love collecting these coins and this is a great way to display them. It is also going to be a make a wonderful gift for my grandson.
4,it is the thing I just want,"I like the design of this, with a map to locate all the quarters. You can gain the knowledge about USA geography at the same time. And it is not very expersive to me. I like this."
5,"Nice graphics, and my 5 year old nephew was thrilled!","This is much nicer than the typical quarter display, with the map adding a great educational dimension. My nephew, who has collected all the quarters, was very excited about the map, and it seemed very sturdy and colorful. I would recommend."
3,Map,The Quarters fit will into there asigned spaces but dont't push to hard on the coin are the two cardboards will seperate and the coin will slide down inside the map. Still it is a better made map than the other two brands that I own.
3,Supporting Windows NT and 2000 Workstation and Server,If you ignore the numerous spelling and grammar mistakes you'll find this is a good reference that mixes a lot of the basics/background with recent and relevant topics. The straightforward text makes it easy to absorb so you almost forget you are reading a 'techie' book at all. Good reference book for the workplace.
2,Truly made of glass,"The product looks exactly like the picture, maybe a bit larger than I expected, but unfortunately the glass globe fell out of my hand and shattered in a zillion pieces as soon as I opened the box. Turns out the globe cannot be replaced, not even by the vendor. For this reason I would not recommend it."
3,"Okay read, but no John Grisham","I got this book from a friend who loves this genre and said this book was decent. I have to say that I was so disappointed. To compare this author to John Grisham is a stretch to say the least. The plot was predictable and the I found myself wanting the story to just end. A decent book, but not great."
4,"Fast pace, entertaining and credible","I concur with the reviewer from Harrington Park... this is a book worth staying awake at night to read. Within a few pages, Katsoris dots his story with colorful characters just real enough to unnerve you when they stumble and laugh with joy when they win. Katsoris handles all his themes with admirable dexterity and clarity. The pace is fast, the characters interesting and the result entertaining."
2,All photos and no text.,"Whilst not aimed at the younger reader, this book might as well be just that. On the inside of the back cover we are treated to a story of how, as young girl, this author took goldfish from a pond and the likened her keeping those fish to the ancient Chinese.Similarly, on the inside of the front cover, we are informed this book is a guide to ""some of the many facets of fish behaviour."" It is no such thing.Quite frankly, some of the photographs are very good but the lack of text allows this book to fall at the first hurdle.NM"
5,Haunting,"Since I acquired XM radio, I've discovered new worlds of music - specifically, the ""World Music"" channel. Heard the title song of this CD and had to buy it. Thought the rest of the cuts would be throwaways, but was stunned by the power of some of the other songs, such as ""Nakhla.""This CD is an education for someone with feet glued to the United States."
2,You can skip this one,"While this is a great testimony to a great man, I found some of the information lacking in facts. I also found iti nterestig that while Zig pontificated on his many failures prior to becomming a master motivator and best selling author, he left out some of his failures that occurred after he became successful.I enjoyed See you at the Top and Secrets of Closing Sales but was not at all impressed wth this, even though I do enjoy autobiographies."
2,It's okay...,"I am revising this review because I made a mistake! I gave this album 5 stars not realizing that I was talking about Celestial Reiki 2!This album is just 'okay'. I never really liked it. I listened to it a few times and did not care to play it ever again.But I will keep what I said in my 5 star 'mistake' review, because it is true in this case. To all the people who worry about these 5 star or 1 star ratings, I got this to say. Don't pay so much attention to them, and get what resonates with you. I have heard so many CDs that have full 5 star ratings, but they sound like crap to me. It's all the matter of perspective."
1,celestial reiki,"I have been a massage therapist for 15 years, and have listened to many CDs that claim to be relaxing. I must say, this one is by-far the worse CD I have ever heard and purchased. I could not get through half of it! I did receive it on time and it was is good condition, but I am very, very unhappy with Celestial Reiki.Marie"
3,Food is Not Heroin or Alcohol,"In many respects this book contains wonderful insights, analysis, guidance and direction and clearly helps define food addiction. However, if you are a vegetarian, there is no food plan approved, thus you are out of luck. The suggested Food Plan is virtually impossible and unrealistic in today's society given the shear number of foods one must eliminate. Abstinence is one thing if it's heroin, entirely another if the substance is food, as one is, by nature, required to eat to survive. Abstaining from all of the ""trigger foods"" listed seems virtually impossible to me. I can't help but wonder if this Food Plan is what all OA members abide by?"
4,Kay's books will change your life,"Recovery is not an easy journey. Ms. Sheppard's clear and warm writing style has, for many people, lit the way to the path of recovery.You will find yourself in these pages. You will rejoice that someone understands what you are going through. You will rebel/bargain/take issue with the food plan, and then (hopefully) you will take the chance and follow it, and your life will be changed forever. With a lot of hard work and soul searching, you can recover.Note to beginners - you may find Kay's earlier work ""Food Addiction - the Body Knows"" to be more helpful and descriptive of the disease. I would recommend ""Food Addiction II - From the First Bite"" to those already familiar with this program of recovery."
5,The answer for this food addict,"I disagree with kristimetz who said this book would make people more obsessed with food. A true food addict must abstain from all foods and behaviors that trigger addictive behavior or cravings in order to be free of the obsession with food. For me that means weighing and measuring my food, because I was a volume addict, as well as abstaining from foods that are addictive, ie flour, sugar and wheat. This food plan has freed me from food obsession (along with working a 12 step program with a sponsor). Yes, I weigh and measure three meals a day. Do I mind. No, because I only think about food at mealtime and while preparing it whereas I used to think about food all day long. I'm a much happier and saner person now."
5,Great doing business with this seller.,I would fully recommend this book to all who have trouble with food addiction. It is a very healthy eating plan.
3,Yes it works but.....,"Just for the record this is not the Food plan of OA. OA has a list of recommended food plans which can be obtained at a meeting. However OA states clearly that there is no ""formal plan and as such encourages its memebers to seek professional advice.Sheppards books are groundbreaking in that they take food as seriously as any other form of drug or medication. Yes we must eat but food is chemistry and that chemistry can indeed influence everything from cravings to the disasterous effects of diabestes.In point of fact this food plan is excellent for diabetics and has worked miracles in many peoples lives.It is strict but the effects can be remarkable. However it is not for everyone.For myself I never felt better physcially than when following this plan.As for OA you need to go to a least 6 meetings before you really can get the gist of it and as mentioned earlier it does not sanction any one food plan."
5,Hold the wheat and the sugar...for life.,"I grabbed this book off the shelf of a bookstore....and it just floored me. I knew I had found an answer for me. The writer, Kay Sheppard, is very strict and she tells the reader what to do and in a way that makes you agree to follow her orders, because it makes sense and you know, deep down, that what she is saying true. I have not finished the book, yet, but I have been wheat-free and sugar-free for one month. And I am feeling better than I have in a long long time. My energy is beginning to come back, my mood is stable, my brain fog gone. I am still working on the portion control, but I know that Kay Sheppard will tell me what I need to know, and show me how to get there. No excuses allowed."
3,Great product for the money if you know what you're doing,"I just finished a sharpening session and feel I got my money's worth from this jig and foresee it lasting for quite a few years. That being said, if you are not the most mechanically inclined then I would not recommend this product for you. It works BUT unless you understand all of the different angles of a drill bit tip and how to line the bit up with the face of the grinding wheel to achieve the shape you desire then I suggest going with something like the drill doctor to save yourself hours of frustration.I got mine to work and will be able to achieve whatever complex angle I want with this jig...BUT...it takes patience to line the bit up just right with the face of the grinding wheel."
5,A thoroughly enjoyable book that was hard to put down!,"Amid the Pages is a remarkably insightful book about a book and its experiences through ""life"". As I read it, I never knew what to expect next--much like life itself. It kept me wondering what would happen next and made it difficult to put down. It reveals much about life and what a difference words can make to improve our lives. It offers many lessons and helps a person understand what's most important. In the end, the book comes full-circle and give you an ""a ha!"" moment. It is a fabulous book--one everyone should read!"
4,Awesome product!,I love this body cream! It keeps my skin smoother and less dry than any other product I have used.
3,it had its flaws but...,"overall this was a good book. i liked the plot twist. however, i found erde, and the baron to be totally insuferable. i liked the story but found undo disrespect steeped on the one main charecter who has the most heart, ndoch. i enjoyed the read. overall, the conclusion was good and opens up all kinds of possibilites for the series conclusion. i am not looking forward to another long wait but rushing the story would be worse. so i'll try to keep the plot points strait until the book of air comes out."
3,"Good, but not great,","I must say that I was a little let down by this book. Number one reason: I had to wait so long to read it that I had forgotten half of the plot! Number two reason: I just don't like where she's taking the story. Don't get me wrong, it's a good book, and over all, I did enjoy it, but I felt unsatisfied at the end. Hopefully, the next one is better."
4,Tongue-In-Cheek Dance Music,"This is ""heavy dance"" music that still can make anyone who grew up in the 80's laugh out loud! It is trance-dance oriented, and almost every song in this greatest hits package is excellent. The higher price made me wait a while before I bought it, but if you are a 80's Dance fan of such bands like Dead or Alive, you would get into this."
1,Sixty Bucks?! Unreal..... {1.5 Stars},"I can't believe that's what this is selling for. To be completely honest, I don't know why anyone would want this album, let alone pay twenty bucks for it. There's no way in the world this disc is anywhere close to being worth more than five bucks.I bought this out of Goodwill (in excellent shape) for 50 cents simply because I, like so many other people, loved ""The Safety Dance"" when it came out. This disc also includes an extended mix of ""The Safety Dance"" that's four and a half minutes long (the regular version clocks in at just under 3 minutes). Those are the only two songs on the entire album that are remotely close to being listenable. Everything else is garbage.I guess if Canadian synth pop from the 80's is your thing, then this would make for a decent pick up. Otherwise, avoid like the plague.If you're looking to buy this album, shoot me an e-mail. I'll gladly slash these prices.Standout Tracks: The Safety Dance and The Safety Dance (Extended Version)"
5,Delicious & Extra Large,These are the biggest cashews I have ever seen. They are unsalted and come mostly whole as expected. I toss them lightly with smoked and spiced salts and package them as gifts. Keep most of them for the family. They are tasty and roasted to perfection. I have ordered these a few times. Never disappointed.
1,Ballet DVD,"The soundtrack on my copy was terrible with music fading in and out throughout the 2 hr + performance. I had the volume turned up as high as possible but at times the music was barely audible. The soundtrack was so bad, so irritating, so annoying that I doubt I will ever watch the DVD again."
2,A rotten tomato in a golden box.,"This is a relatively well-made ballet DVD among others. However, the cheesy performance really is not worth such a luxury. Compared to the fascinating 1988 Kirov version by Tatyana Terekhova and Farouk Ruzimatov, this one is on the kindergarten level, I'd say. I really don't know why Lucette Aldous was able to get a chance to play the leading role with her flat, robot-like performance. What's more, in the final act she seems to be totally exhausted with sore legs that couldn't stretch or even stand at all. I think the only reason Kultur Video made this DVD so well is simply because it presents Nureyev, whose name is supposed to attract lots of ballet fans (although I personally don't think his performance could compete with Ruzimatov's in the Kirov version). My own suggestion is that don't pick this version, if you are not a big Nureyev fan."
5,Don Quixote,"My requirements were that the version available was a ballet danced in the traditional style,with traditional tutus and costume,with tradtional stage settings. This item met my specifications completely. Amazon's understandings and desire to fill their customers needs has proved to be far more dedicated than face to face service received from local retailers."
4,insightful but not as comprehensive as some,"I agree with both the positive and negative reviewers of this book.On the positive side: Friedman is often more original, more insightful, and more interesting than the ""Chumashes by committee"" that most congregations use (by which I mean the Orthodox Artscroll, the Conservative Etz Chaim, as well as Plaut's Reform Chumash). On the average, IFriedman made one or two points per Torah portion that made me say ""Wow!"" to myself.On the negative side: this book is simply not comprehensive enough to substitute for the committee Chumashes. The committee Chumashes tend to be almost line-by-line (at least compared to Friedman's book). Friedman's depth is gained at the sacrifice of breadth: he covers only the topics that really interest him.And of course, he doesn't cover Haftorot at all.This book is a fine supplement to the committee Chumashes (or to Hertz, who is also more comprehensive than Friedman) - but not a substitute."
3,Not enough Hebrew,"I wanted the Hebrew text also, so that was a bit disappointing. I was a bit confused at first at what was commentary and what was text. I guess I was looking for a duplicate of the hard copy"
2,Commentary on the Torah by Richard E. Friedman,Commentary on the Torah by Richard E. Friedman has a number of very insightful observations. His insights and the accolades by those who endorse this work are discolored by the sliding scale of political correctness rather than the absolute righteousness and Holiness of the God of the text. Because of this the text of the commentary is suspect and difficult to receive at face value.
5,Wonderful! A treasure for all who study the Torah.,"This is really a great commentary and translation. This book offers insights for students of all levels! I have intermediate understanding and language proficiency in hebrew, and I get something new from the commentary every time I read it! I would highly recommend this book to everyone who wants to deepen their understanding of the torah."
1,Foolish Amazon preview,"When I try to preview this book, I discover a stunning feature. The portion they let you see through is ... just a portion of the table of contents. Is that what a preview suppose to be? How foolish. I can't give any star to the book because I haven't read it. But I give 1 star to the preview feature."
1,The send a diffrent order,"I am so offendedI order the ""B"" style and they send another order i was purchesed for my mamiya rb67 and the give me the one for canon or nikon camera( the normal one ) and it's not fit for sure !!"
3,This thing sticks (literally),"Minus one star for the padding. Although thick enough, I would have liked to have seen a covering over the padding. Minus one star for the smell. Although it was wrapped in factory plastic it reaked of incense. Why I don't know. It is comfortable and locks nicely into place for use on my Mamiya 645e Film camera."
3,Review for Mamiya 645 PRO TL Strap from OP/TECH,"In spite of negative comments on this strap for M645 Pro TL with winder , it works , but it's necessary to go strongly and not to hesitate to push !!I found that the material of the belt is cheap , but it works fine nevertheless."
5,Where was this book when I had my first leadership position?,"The emotional role of leadership became clearer to me after reading Jim's book. He doesn't glorify the power of the position, but rather that ""people respond to this leadership because they can clearly see the principles from which it flows."" I learned techniques that help me be a purveyor of hope with my team, even though I don't sit in the chair at the top.Like the Reader's Digest that my father always had around when I was younger, The Leader's Digest is full of powerful ideas packed in bite-size chunks. Jim's book, however, weaves those bites into a meal. Without going the route of the popular business fable, Jim's style makes for easy reading as he sprinkles appropriate quotes around contemporary research presented in a non-academic fashion. Where else can you read ""The Anti-Serenity Prayer"" coupled with The Serenity Prayer?"
1,Destroyed Dragon,"We got this dragon for my 3 year old and it broke the 1st day he had it. The wings fall off whenever he plays with it and soon after the legs came off too. I thought it was an expensive toy initially for just an action- figure, but now that I've seen how flimsy it is I believe it to be a total rip off. Unless your child used this as a collectable and didn't play with it, I would not recommend it."
5,Great book,My kids loved this book. I loved the CD. I used it for a listening center in my classroom. The lids were able to follow along with the page turn signals.
5,Great Halloween version of an old favorite!,"This is a funny and easy-to-read picture book with hilarious illustrations, perfect for the 3-6 year-old in your life. My son and I read this together at least 10 times, and he still remembers it fondly. The one to two sentences per page read with an easy cadence that makes the book flow, very like the original Old Lady story. Great Halloween reading!"
1,"Really, really bad.","When will I learn? I was gullible enough to order this when all the 5 star reviews appeared. I feel pretty stupid now, it's perfectly obvious that the good reviews are planted by folks involved with the film. What do these people do in their spare time? Go round old ladies' houses and con them out of their savings? They conned me out of my $11 for sure.This film absolutely reeks. It stinks to high heaven. Even as a fan of bad movies, this had no redeeming qualities.I feel robbed."
3,Not so fast!!,"Before everyone rushes out and pre-orders this dvd, I want to do a service to all the horror movie fans here on AMAZON. If you check all the five star reviews, five of the six have left only one review, and of course it was for this movie. The other reviewer left a total of two. It's been my experience that when people associated with the movie try to flood the site with b.s. reviews before the movie actually releases that it's a bad sign. I'm not saying that this is going to be a bad movie, the first one was actually pretty good. I gave this one three stars just so I could get this out to let people know they might want to wait until the dvd is actually released and read the real reviews before they buy. Peace."
1,There's B Movies and then there's just crap!,"Wow...this was just bad. Bad writing, bad production, bad sound...just bad. The characters just weren't as much fun as the ones in the first one. Other than the very brief HuckleBilly rap song, this was horrible. Even though I like Bill Moseley, this movie is really missing Robert Englund. This feels like a movie that someone threw together in a weekend. Hopefully it'll be the end of the series."
1,if u like this movie shoot urself,i love the first one and this movie just was sooo terrible learn how to make good horror sequels jez no wonder all horror movies r going to dvd these days
1,Hard to believe this was the same director,"This film is a complete failure on every level. I enjoyed the first film, and bought this dvd based on that. This is like something shot in your backyard with your buddies over the weekend. The humor reminded me of the VAMPIRES SUCK trailors that have been assaulting televison lately. The entire thing is painful to watch. I was ashamed of myself when I made it to the credits."
1,Don't bother. I couldn't sit through it.,"I did enjoy the HG Lewis ""2000 Maniacs"" and also liked the semi-remake ""2001 Maniacs"", but this sequel to the remake is unwatchable. It's not funny (but the filmmakers think it is; the kiss of death) and I began to long to hit fast forward after suffering through the first hour. Very bad, and not in a good way."
1,2001 wastes of time...,"Ugh! This is a really poorly made, acted, and executed movie, and I personally LIKE bad movies. Just not worth watching, folks.If it made more fun of itself, it would have been better, but it tries to be scary and fails, it tries to be sexy and fails, and it tries to be funny and fails. Don't waste you time."
4,Ehh,This movie is good but not as good as 2001 manias at all so if you are going to go into this movie expecting greatness like the other film you WILL be disappointed.
2,2001 Maniacs: Field of Screams,"2001 Maniacs was one of the best horror remakes of all time. Robert Englund as the mayor was priceless and the supporting cast was good. A good mix of cool gore and humor really made it a treat. Then I waited two years or more for them to make a sequel. Boy, I could have waited anther two!The movie sucks beyond belief, a big let down. The humor is alright but the people they go out and slaughter are really annoying. Bill Mosley is a respected actor among horror movie fans and he did good but the script was poorly written. Granny is back and she did a good job as well but like Mosley, something was off. I didnt care for the rest of the maniacs. In the first movie, they are against blacks and asians but they are in this movie. The gore was cool but there wasn't often in my opinion. Then ending was pretty stupid as well.Overall, if you enjoyed the first one then you may enjoy this movie. I didnt laugh too much."
1,"Worst movie ever, what a waste of time. Really deserves -5 stars","This movie blows, I loved the first one and had been waiting for quite sometime for part 2. Major let done on every level. Since I'm a horror movie buff I had to finish watching it although my wife begged me to turn it off. I will admitt I do like off the wall movies but not even I can beleive they made this junk. I felt these actors were out of work and had nothing else to do but make this movie. Girls were pretty, that's about the only good thing about the movie. Just plain dumb. Please don't make a 3rd."
1,Extremely Bad Movie Making,"This film is a pathetic excuse for film making. It is boorish, trite and a regurgitation of the same theme over and over ad nauseum. No suspense, no scares etc.. Everything is telegraphed in advance. The film is infantile at best. The acting is atrocious and amateurish, but what you expect in a low quality film like this. Their attempts at humor in the film border on the childish and moronic. The only humorous thing about this film is that the people involved are so deluded that they think they produced a good piece of work. It is hilarious to think that a film company wasted valuable money in today's economy on a joke of a film. This dvd isn't worth 11 cents much less 10.99..If you want to get value for your money, buy the original 2000 maniacs film and not these cheap cardborad regurgitations and reimaginings. The original was a trailblazing film unlike this pile of dung."
1,Why all the praise?,"2001 Maniacs, the Field of Screams, is a sequel to 2001 Maniacs, a remake of an earlier title called 2000 Maniacs. The first movie and it's remake were serious horror movies even though there might have been some comic relief involved. As far as I am concerned, and I don't write a review often, but I felt people should be warned, this movie was worthless. It tried to have comedy that I felt failed miserably, and it tried to have gore, I felt not nearly enough, not often enough, and not real enough. The whole movie felt like a bunch of people trying to make a parody of a horror movie. I felt the movie failed on every level. It'll go on the shelf with the other two, but who am I kidding, I'll never watch it again."
1,First Look.... one of the worst film studios ever.,I pre-ordered this a month ago and now there's a two week wait the day it comes out. i blame First Look... they couldnt care less about their customers.
4,CLARITY,"THIS SYSTEM IS GORGEOUS FOR ONE. ALSO, BUYERS SHOULD KNOW THAT THIS SYSTEM WAS APPARENTLY NOT MANUFACTURED FOR VOLUME, BUT FOR CLARITY. WE'VE HAD OTHER SURROUND SOUNDS, INCLUDING DREAM SYSTEMS AND OUT OF 40 VOLUME MAX, WE COULD PLAY IT FROM 15-20 FOR EXTREME VOLUME. THIS SYSTEM IS DIFFERENT. WE HAVE TO PLAY IT AROUND 30-35 FOR THE EQUAL EFFECT. THING IS, IT ISN'T A PROBLEM BEACUSE THE CLEARNESS AND CLARITY OF THE SOUND IS UNBELIEVABLE! IT MAKES THE LACK OF VOLUME WELL WORTH IT. NOW, DON'T GET ME WRONG, AT VOLUME 35, IT IS STILL QUITE LOUD. JUST KNOWING I COULD SO MUCH HIGHER WITH THE OTHER SYSTEM WE HAD MADE ME WONDER AT FIRST WHY I PAID SO MUCH FOR THIS SYSTEM. AFTER LISTENING TO THE QUALITY OF THIS ONE, I FULLY UNDERSTAND & DON'T REGRET MY CHOICE AT ALL."
2,An incredibly BIASED account of Hancock and his role in the,"events leading to independence. After reading Unger's work, you would think that John Hancock single handedly brought this country to freedom. The author's extreme adulation for his subject constantly paints Hancock in positive light and ALWAYS as the victim of others, never at fault. Lame excuses are given for why Hancock did not receive this office or that praise. One of the most disturbing elements is the vindictive condemnation of Samuel Adams (probably the man most singularly responsible for influencing the Declaration of Independence) is incredibly overdone and grossly inaccurate. Speeches which were written by Adams (and some given by Adams) are credited to Hancock, a man who is overwhelmingly acknowledged as lacking the writing ability for such speeches. Hancock is instrumental in bringing about revolution but unfortunately, not in the way suggested by this author."
5,Excellent Purchase,"This book is written so well, I couldn't put it down. I have looked for other books by this author. He is a real story teller. Hancocks life is worth knowing and a credit to the founders."
2,Still trying to complete this one...,The title drew me in and the subject sounded great. But to be honest it is still on the shelf as I just couldn't get motivated with this one.I will have another look but after half the book is read I am still not very interested. Sorry.
3,Not enough juice for the squeeze,"Impressive formalization of information flow via mathematics and logic, but in the end it's not clear if this subject holds any practical value. For, in practice, the model of information flow always requires a priori working models of the phenomena under consideration before the principles of information flow can be put to use. For example, consider currency fluctuations as information about some nation's economy. You can model this using Barwise's scheme, but doing so doesn't bring anything to one's understanding that we didn't already have from economics. No real clarification on what information is, either (although there's a lengthy discussion of this at the outset). Requires a fairly good working knowledge of set theory and basic formal logic. Poorly edited."
2,extremely disappointed with the sound - its dubbed!,"One would surely expect (and demand) live guitar sound in such a production? Instead however most of the playing scenes show JB in effect miming to a studio over-dub! You might as well turn the sound off and pop in one of his CD's.Of course one will expect some roughness in a live setting (and indeed this is hilariously illustrated when he 'plays' Cadiz in a bumpy train carriage) but, for me at least, this adds to the experience.If I had known the sound situation beforehand there is no way I would have bought this product."
4,Good,"In general I liked, mainly from the part of the classic guitar from now on since am not fanatic of the Baroque music. I would have liked more the scenes were focused more in Julian Bream playing the guitar instead of landscapes, cities and people.Something that I didn't like was that several songs are interrupted by comments.I think that is beautiful for somebody to who it likes the guitar.One of the things that I like of Julian Bream is that it's seen that when he plays the guitar, he feels the music."
1,Goebbels would be proud!,"I recently had a chance to review this movie with a number of Vietnam War vets and found it to be an excellent example of revisionist history. Most of the information presented was correct and factual; however, the anti-war movement was never as extensive as it is portrayed in the movie. Especially the behavior of the American military. The Army was never at a point of mutiny the way it was protrayed in the movie. The truth is we pulled out of Vietnam because it was perceived as a losing war, not because of any perception of the war being unjust. Anti-communist feelings were strong up until the early eighties, when it was replaced by fear of radical Islamic fundamentalists. I grew up during these times and the anti-war movement was never as extensive as the movie makes it out to be."
5,Stunning piece of unreported history,"These guys had cajones-- they went to the brig -- one even got shot to death-- for resisting fighting in Viet Nam. They had a whole network of resistance- radio, magazines. Watching this, you get a better sense of what really probably ended the war in VN- not necessarily protesters back home, but resistance within. I met a vet once who punched his senior officer; apparently he was not just an odd duck with an anger problem. There was a whole movement that has been whitewashed."
5,Wonderful book.,"I got this book when i was about 9 yrs. old, it's a wonderful book. It about a little girl who has to move in with her cousins, several of them. Prefect for a preteen or any one who likes to read old fashion stories, kind of like ""Little Women""."
4,still uniqe,"Even though this album was not a success and obviously it has the end written all over it,it was still agreat release.Especially considering other band's lp's at that time.Yes,the lyrics became sarcastically dark.But that is exactly what made this album so interesting.What other band would spread out over the entire length of arelease that they can't stand each other any longer?And yet their musicianship was still intact.They even managed to come up with a number of great hooks such as on 'giving up'.I still play that cd."
2,Men at Work - Out of Gas,"I remember purchasing this album when it came out in 1985. I hated it and soon cashed it in on a trade at the local vinyl exchange. Their 1982 album, Business as Usual, is stellar all the way through. Cargo, released the following year, was okay, but far below the first release, and - with the exception of Overkill - had the feel of a gathering of outtakes and extras that were not deemed worthy of inclusion on Business as Usual.I recently found a copy of Two Hearts - again on vinyl - at a local shop and decided to give it a second chance. Time has not improved this mess. This was apparently the band's last gasp. While it is not painful or grating to listen to, there is nothing memorable here. For completists only.As an aside, some of Colin Hay's later solo projects are quite good."
1,Flop album from a no-talent band.,"Each of Men at Work's albums sold significantly less than the one before it. The sophomore slump ""Cargo"" sold substantially less than ""Business as Usual."" And ""Two Hearts"" sold way less than ""Cargo,"" which was already viewed as a SERIOUS disappointment as it had only ONE hit single. ""Two Hearts"" was a huge disaster for the band; the single ""Everything I Need"" wasn't even a top 40 hit. It FLOPPED. This means that by the mid 1980s, Men at Work were already washed up with nowhere to go. DuranDuran, on the other hand, survived musical differences and changes in the band lineup, but STILL whipped out hit after hit after hit. Think about it. You have DuranDuran in one corner, and you have the forgotten ""Men at Work"" in the other. Which of these two bands would YOU choose?"
4,Media Overkill: Death of a great album,"In the summer of 1985, I lived in the northern Rocky Mountains far from the mindless repetition of MTV and Top 40 radio. ""Two Hearts"" was in my car's tapedeck for that summer and it was not the lackluster and tepid folloup that so many people thought. The media's insatiable appetite for the next big thing is what killed Men At Work and many other promising bands. ""Two Hearts"" was an excellent third effort by the band and it clearly showed their maturity and growth as a band--it's a shame that its' hard to find--I hope someday it finds its' way to re-release. MTV ruined music for many--it peddled style over substance and as a result--a lot of great music was ignored. This album was clearly a casualty of media overexposure. None of that matters--to hell with the critics, it's a classic to me. It takes me back instantaneously to that summer and the great times I had...."
3,Poor video quality,"Barbara's review is comprehensive as to story details and the technical quality of these films. I'm a big fan of silent films and I enjoyed these, the only two examples of silent Chinese cinema I've ever seen. However, the poor video quality will put most viewers off. The stories are typical melodramas for the period and reasonably well acted. The DVD case gives the running times of the films as 100 minutes each. Actual running times are 86 minutes for Two Stars in the Milky Way, and 112 minutes for A Spray of Plum Blossoms."
5,Trumph the Insult Dog DVD,"I am very satisfied with my purchase, it was all I had hoped it to be. The service was excellent, I received my order promptly, in fact, sooner than I expected."
1,Flop!,"This DVD was NOT funny!!! If you think you'll get the BEST of Triumph skits like you see on Conan, you are wrong! This DVD was just a waste of money! You'll see the WORST of the Triumph skits. This was so boring, I turned it off after 20 minutes! Don't waste your money on this one!"
5,Very nice DVD...For me to POOP on!!!!,"This DVD contains various clips of Triumph the Insult Comic Dog shredding people to pieces with his lethal insults. Some of the better clips include Triumph's trip to a Star Wars convention, interviewing Bon Jovi, and his attack on notorious American Idol judge Simon Cowell. Treat yourself to a few laughs and pick up this DVD."
1,Worst Purchase That I Ever Made in My Life,"This is the worst purchase that I ever made in my life. It had some decent Conan scripts included but this compilation is poor in my opinion,"
5,Erase My Mind Please,"My friends and I always talk about how we wish we could erase our mind and re-watch something for the first time. This was one of those times. I was really just looking for the Star Wars and Westminster bits from the Conan show.... so I didn't expect much out of the rest of the disc. Best $9.99 I've ever spent. It's fantastic. I haven't laughed this hard in a long time. My wife and a bunch of our friends watched it together and we loved every minute of it. Check out the American Idol stuff, comedy at its best. ""Ohhhh, Clouds. Poor Hawaii!"""
4,Absolutely hilarious,"Triumph is too funny! My favorite is the Star Wars scene...who knew how into Star Wars people could be! Be sure you have a tolerance for crudeness before you buy this video though, or prepare to be offended!"
5,No keeding.,"Triumph can't fail to amuse the hell out of me every time I watch this dvd. His witty comments and endless bitch-humping are just a few of his well-known trademarks. You just gotta buy this. Go poop with Triumph, NOW!"
5,A GOOD DVD FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!,"This DVD is hilarious...I haven't seen this many stars, since the last time I got kicked in the b@lls...it's definately a good DVD for me to P00P on."
3,Evocative look back at what England was like,"Brigg's presents a sort of melancholy portrait of his parent's life in England from the 20'3/30's through the early 70's. He does a great job showing what a classist society England was (is?) and really captured the outlook and attitudes of the working class. His images and use of the vernacular are make this book a winner. It very much reminded me of the Maus books (cartoon depicting the Holocaust using the device of mice and cats). I recommended this book, but probably for those who have some context (e.g. English relatives, knowledge of English social history). The first half of the book is more inspired, speaking to the optimism of his parents in making their home and facing WWII. The second half has a somewhat uncomfortably bitter feeling, as the parents age and become frustrated with their son's ""moderness"" and the decline of British social state."
4,Highly recommended,"A charming, heartfelt and moving story - a lovely memorial to the author's parents (and a reminder of how short life really is)."
1,Rusts quickly,"I bought two at petsmart, just returned them (luckily they have a good return policy). The two leads were only THREE MONTHS old and already the cable was quite rusted (making it doubtful that it is properly galvanized). Plus within 5 days of each other, the rust caused the cable to cleanly separate on both leads. This resulted in the dogs escaping and running through the neighbor's yard.It also wasn't the dogs' weight, one is 75 lbs and one is 35 and this is supposed to be rated at 125lbs."
2,Rusted...,"The clamp system and cable are fine and I like the way it works. The dog will never figure out how to get it off and it will take a pet thief a bit to figure it out too.My dog got out of the yard one night and one of my neighbors brought him back. He couldn't figure out how to get the clamp to work so he just tied the cable to my dog's collar. :))Biggest con. It's rusted out now. It began rusting within the first week. If this is going to be anywhere it can get wet, consider another option."
5,Works well with a 40 lb pup,Just don't leave it out in the rain! Rust will greet you the next time you use it.
2,Need Better Hooks,The snap hooks are VERY weak. The hook on one end broke on day two and the hook on the other end broke on day four. Both hooks failed at the swivel. The cable seems to be of excellent quality and should provide good service with the replacement hooks.
4,Works great for me,"I use this to clip my two dogs (35 and 55 lbs) to a very secure ground stake. One end of this clips into a ground stake, the other I use to clip around the middle of a second 20 ft lead to which I attach my dogs at either end. The backwards opening clips another reviewer mentions are designed thaat way to guard against accidental opening. This lead seems to last about 4-5 months of being out in the New England weather at which point it fails where the wire is swaged to the clip. About average life for a lead of this type. Recomended."
1,My 25 pound beagle broke it after one use.,"I wish I could give this zero stars! This is an unsafe piece of crap. It broke the second time we ever used it. It says it is for dogs up to 125 pounds?! What a joke! My beagle is 25 pounds and he broke the clasp and got off! Luckily we got him before he tried to run away, but I'm still angry about this joke of a product! Do NOT buy this unless your dog is a little tea-cup sized chihuahua, Even then I would use caution!"
1,Bad Cracking on the Cable,"I bought this near Thanksgiving and the cable is already craking and it's Christmas Eve.So, my dog won't be secure too much longer on this.....!!"
3,"Rusts quickly, and not easy to work with","I've had this chain for two months. Like other reviewers, the clasps are starting to rust, it doesn't really bother me, but it is obviously made improperly if this is happening.Also, I really hate how the clasp is designed. Most other clasps you can snap on with one hand. Not this one, you need two hands, and some patience. The piece to open it up moves out. I've never really gotten used to it."
2,First day the hook up rusted. difficult connection,"I wish it was better. My coonhound gets a scent and has broken 7 tie outs. Most of the clasps fail,some broke,some got ripped from cord.I just chased him down at 1 am today. I had so much difficulty hooking him up to this tie out that I connected a shorter leash to this tie out for ease in connection...of course it broke. I need a better tool to open an close clasp. Suggestions are welcome."
4,good product,This is strong and should hold up better than the last cable which broke in a few months from weather and bending. Good price for product.
5,Great for outside my garage,"DOn't mind the negative reviews, i installed these above my garage and couldn't be happier with the light output and quality of light.recommended!"
5,Outdoor Energy Saving,before we found these bulbs we were changing bulbs in are recess lighting every 3 months after we change to this bulb about 2 years ago we have not change one since then.
5,You may find this movie in following address,Excellent movie! Excellent songs! It was a popular movie in Hong Kong. As far as I know we can found this movie in VCD or DVD format. But It might have chinese caption in the picture (not sure!!!) Try the following source: https://www.dvdshelf.com/ or https://www.dvdshelf.com/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/ProductDisplay?prrfnbr=22167&prmenbr=152&CGRY_NUM=251&LANGUAGE=2
5,Info on where to get the movie,"To the people requesting info on where to get this movie. You should go to an auction site like ebay.com, they always have the movie used in VHS format. At this very moment (Friday-feb-27-2004)they have three or four copies auctioned.On the other hand, this CD and the movie are really great. The movie is by far the best movie I've ever seen in my whole life, and the music composed by the BG's is an early sample of the greatness to come."
2,Too Much Conversation,"Bought this because we have and enjoyed the Yoga for Beginners title from the same group (Element). However, the instructor in this video, Ashley Turner, has a very different teaching style. Not saying Ashley's style is bad, just that there was WAY too much personal improvement/development conversation added to yoga pose guidance for our liking. We also have several DVD's by Rodney Yee and find his style -- focused and WITHOUT the personal development conversation -- to be preferrable. Will probably turn the audio down on this DVD and just listen to our own background music if we use this one again."
5,I LOVE ASHLEY!,"Even in the corny moments of this DVD (dragon breath) this is an amazing practice! Ashley is just the best, explaining each move so deliberately you can really feel yourself executing each pose as a teacher would want you to. Excellent for beginners and masters, a really calming flow practice."
4,Too long! But not bad.,It is too long. It would be great if it gives the opportunity to break it in half or do it all together.
1,Too slow,"Too slow and boring for me. I couldn't get through it. But I have no patience, so maybe that's why it wasn't for me..."
3,One of the Milestone Works in Military Operations Research,"Dupuy presents his Quantified Judgment Model (QJM) and employs if for the analysis of historical combat data. After describing the model, he provides detailed analysis of data from World War II and the 1967 and 1973 Arab-Israeli conflicts. A few other battles are surveyed as well, from Austerlitz to The Somme. He also provide trend analysis in a number of military dimensions. The book has three target audiences: military OR analysts, military historians, and conflict simulation hobbyists. (This review is based on the original edition.)"
5,Great mortising attachment for drill press,"I bought this about 6 months ago. I use it on my Rigid drill press. The G1083 comes without mortising cutters. You need to buy them separately - they are sold by Grizzly and are made in China.The attachment is very good quality. I ordered the quill size to fit my Rigid. You do need to remove the paint from the quill attachment area for it to fit properly. The paint is very hard and thick and this took about 1 hour to scrape to bare metal using a knife and sandpaper.The chisels, sold separately, are good even though make in China. Be sure to follow the instructions on setting them up or they will not work properly."
4,Useful for serious students,"If the quaternary elements of Book Four are the prose of Thelema, then volumes like this are its poetry. The book proves its worth early on by presenting a FULL A.'.A.'. curriculum, then explores deeper mysteries with Liber LXV and a brilliantly commented edition of Blavatsky's Voice of the Silence. Additionally, the book contains several beautiful color plates and a very useful illustration of the Tree of Life (with corrected attributions). My only issue with the book is that much of this information can be obtained elsewhere, especially in online archives, but since when has that ever stopped people like us from buying another Crowley book? ;-) AL II:9"
4,great read,"As a Thelemite, I was originally drawn to the Book of the Law (Liber AL) because it deeply resonated with me. This book is no different, save that in some texts there are only the verses quoted that are commented upon. I think it is important for a Thelemite to get their own insight before reading Crowley's commentaries, or to compare both. But one could continue to get insight over time. Crowley's commentaries are based on not only his insight as a Thelemite but in relation to his previous experience as a Buddhist and yogi. The introductions are fitting and effectively quashes any notions of a secret society (i.e. The Illuminati). I also enjoyed the copies of the original artwork included."
3,Sugar (though they don't use that term),"Because the disease runs in my family, this gave me very little new info. However, it clearly links obesity with diabetes and this may motivate many to lose weight. The work spoke of both types of diabetes. The work said, ""Diabetes could lead to stroke, amputation, or blindness,"" but it never showed people with those conditions. Thus, it wasn't trying to shock the viewers in a way that it could. The usual host of this series is a commentator instead this time. They use the term ""pre-diabetic"" when I had heard that experts are trying to retire that idea. This work may be designed for viewers who know absolutely nothing about this widespread illness."
4,if only the live stuff sounded better,"A career retrospective from one of the most unique voices in rock. The assemblers probably thought to include the live stuff because of its rarity value to fans and collectors , but some of it is very poorly recorded. This does not diminish the quality of the performances though. Now if someone would only put out the original Family recordings."
4,I liked it but nothing stood out,"I really enjoyed this CD, but there weren't any show stoppers. Despite this I'm looking forward to the next album."
5,jesse shines on this cd and tour,I went to this concert on the night they recorded this and it was FANTASTIC.Jesse is such a great live singer. It's nice to hear this on a cd without the glare of all the screaming haha. It's definitley worth buying and you should see Jesse life if you get a chance. He delivers a great performance.
5,Jesse's vocals are amazing on the LIVE Beautiful Soul Tour CD!,"The Beautiful Soul Tour LIVE CD will NOT disappoint! Jesse McCartney's vocals are phenomenal on every track and will bring back great memories for any fans that attended the Beautiful Soul Tour! If you weren't able to see Jesse on tour this past summer, then this CD can definitely help you live the experience. The Beautiful Soul Tour LIVE CD would be a great gift to give in the upcoming holiday season to any Jesse fan! Make sure you pick up a copy today!"
1,Warning - Macrovision protected,The CD has Macrovision protection that makes it hard torip tracks and encode to mp3.
4,Also for semi-beginners,"The book covers a broad range of (very practical) topics, with practical cases worked out in detail that are not only useful in themselves but also implicitly clarify techniques. For me the book also contained quite a few eye-openers, possibly because I'm relatively a beginner in this field. This also illustrates, however, that you don't need to be a professional to read this book. I cannot judge how much it brings for someone with substantially more background than I have."
4,A VERY GOOD BOOK,"I'm not an expert Web developer, till now I developed many C/S application but only few Web application. This book helped me in this task. I've found everything I need to develop my application. But way there isn't a CD.Heida Pierpaolo"
2,Where Was the Proofreader?,"In the same paragraph, and sometimes in the same sentence, the book has both ""toLocalString"" and ""toLocaleString."" This happens multiple times. This kind of gross error is disconcerting."
5,Exactly as advertised,"what can i say, this is the book i wanted and they sent it when they said they would."
1,Disappointed. Not as other Wrox books,"Classic Wiley style: boring and heavy reading and not good ""Try it Out"" or ""How it Works"" sections. Bad choice from Wrox as professional guides."
5,Blew me away,The best book about JavaScript is still David Flanagan's excellent book. But Zakas' book is by far the best book on using JavaScript in a production environment. Every page gives you the real world detail you need to harness this powerful languages. The section on XSLT and Mozilla was worth the price of the book alone. Highly recommended if you want to do professional work with JavaScript.
4,Helpful resource.,"Each activity is headlined with which senses the activity is meant to stimulate, which is helpful in writing lesson plans, etc. I did not find the ideas especially novel, but it is a good collection altogether."
4,best as a resource for teachers,"I bought this book hoping to find activities to do with my child at home. I ended up giving it to his classroom teacher. Its good,but its better suited for a teacher who wants to do some art activities in the classroom."
5,Supreme help for a simply marvelous life.,"This little book-""The Secrets of Spiritual Power:Strength For Life's Battles,"" is a wonderful help, for any believer looking to improve their walk with God, and man. Simple practical help from Joyce Meyer, leading us to be better, and more in tune with the Will of God. Knowing who we are, and what we can do-to resist Satan, and get in agreement with God. I recommend this little book highly. Thanks Joyce!"
4,"good, and getting better","I started reading this series because Ms. Saulnier is a friend of a friend of a ... Anyway, I didn't know what to expect when I started, but I've been impressed with her work. The Fourth Wall is a real step forward from Distemper (which was pretty good). Life in this college town is really believable, the story keeps you guessing, and the little twist that pops up in the middle regarding her already complicated love life is absolutely inspired.I thought it took too long for the story to finally return to the events referred to in the opening, but it sure helped keep me hooked, so I guess Saulnier knew what she was doing.I'm definitely looking forward to the next one."
4,A new way of Looking at Erotic Stories,"I personally met Mary Anne at a workshop at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, and after talking to her, she gave me a copy which i read on my flight back. It is very interesting and makes you view sex at a differnt angle, not from a view of perversion but more as an insight on how divine and sweet sex is.Great book. Should read it."
1,"""This book reads like stereo instructions.""","I picked up this book when it was first published. Since there are so few books on the subject, any new book is a welcome addition. That is, until you actually read it. I've had college textbooks that were more fun to read.Apparently, this title sells very well. Perhaps it's the curtain on the cover or the whimsical thought bubbles that lead people to believe the secrets of directing are within this book.If you want a book on directing that is uninspiring, lifeless, and an all-around chore to read, this is your book.If you're still looking for the straight-forward approach to directing you thought would be within this book, ""A Sense of Direction"" by William Ball will ultimately be more helpful."
5,Over and over and over...,"I never tire of listening to this one. ""think Ramones with more and better jokes..."" Ok, but that just scratches the surface. This album boasts unbelievably catchy and rocking tunes, but it's the lyrics that really set MOTO apart from the pack. Caporino has raised crass, misanthropic humor to an art form. You will not believe the things that you find yourself singing along to! I don't really like ""jokey"" rock all that much, but MOTO is absolutely brilliant, and this (along w/ Single File) is a great introduction to this wonderfully twisted world."
4,seems to work,"I bought this to use at a customer's that had horrible mole problems. I think this worked. I put down two applications, and I see a lot fewer tunnels. I hope it keeps working. I know I'll have to reapply, but so far so good."
4,Dance music Fan,"This is a great CD. South Side and song #9 are the two best tracks on the album. All the other tracks are really great, and all of them are great to dance too. They all have a beat that just makes you get up and move, even if you dont know how....Overall a great CD."
3,Pop goes the Hats.,"I know most would call them a one-hit-wonder, but the majority of their songs are great. I think this album and the band in general are quite underrated. I didn't get this album until recently, and realized what I was missing all these years. A very solid and catchy pop album. The title track was the hit here, but I believe ""Moonbeam"" was a single as well. This is consistently good, but my favorites are ""Pop Goes The World"", ""Jenny Wore Black"", ""Intro/Walk On Water"", and the excellent ""On Tuesday"". That song has quite the flute hook. Overall I like their ""Rhythm Of Youth"" album more, but this is the next best thing. Too bad they're all so hard to find."
5,Essential 80s Release,"It's been about fifteen years since I bought this on a whim when it came out in the record stores, and it's still full of surprises. Cohesive concept album, emotional imagery and sentiment, very catchy music. The band displays a stunning degree of self-awareness and insight in its lyrics and delivery. One of the classics to come out of the 1980s."
4,Pricey import,"At its best (""Pop Goes The World,"" ""On TUesday,"" ""Moonbeam,"" and ""O Sole Mio"") this album is a treasure trove of great pure pop gems. At its worst (""Lose My Way,"" ""Dark Side of the Sun"") it is an embarassment.You'll have to decide if the steep price of this import is worth it though."
5,Most Amazing Album I've Ever Heard,"The other responses here do not lie, this is infact the best pop album ever. Pure Genius. If believe that almost anyone who will give this album a chance will enjoy it very much. I you are a fan of this album(which everyone should be), than I recomend other prefect pop albums: Swing Out Sister: Kaelidoscope World Xanadu Soundtrack Pet Shop Boys: Please ABC: Lexicon of Love as well as all other hatter relases!"
1,Why am I wasting my time with this?,"After taking all of the practice tests in this book, I can honestly say that this is by far the worst test-prep book I've ever read (and, like most high schoolers, I've read quite a few.) The explanations and the questions are both broader in scope than anything that might be found in the actual test or a math class. The questions are hapazardly thrown in with no regard to difficulty, and the tests themselves seem to have no consistent difficulty levels (I scored 800 on one and barely 700 on another.) One exam, for example, had 2 or 3 questions testing the exact same concept, with slightly different numbers. Though the harder questions might have argueably given me an edge when I do the real SAT II test, they certainly did not merit my purchase."
5,Great Ending!!,I loved this book! Lots of humor throughout! I really liked the premise of a rake being forced to be a guardian to three girls who are all coming out in one season. There was a nice progression of the relationship as well.
4,I am unsure how to rate this book,"Never had this problem before. This is my first Victoria Alexander book, so I am not sure how she normally writes.I gave it four stars because it was very entertaining and so funny. The stars are all for the laughs in this book. I do not think I have laughed so much in a romance before.I love the story and the characters were very suited, I also loved the sisters, and Thomas's friends.The part I did not like, was how dumb Marianne was at times. For a woman who was suppose to be such a bookworm and intelligent...she seemed to much a dreamer and silly at times. I wanted to smack her. I understand independence, but she just did not seem very independent to me.It was fun to read, and I really laughed hard at how hard poor Thomas tried to win her heart....my four stars are all for you Thomas Effington."
3,"enjoyable, but not exceptional","The upside: what I enjoyed about this book is that there are some funny scenes, like the scene where Marianne wakes Thomas by emtying a watering can over his head, or the scene where he tries to simulate a Romeo and Juliet encounter but doesn't quite make it to the balcony.... Another plus were the small articles about their (somewhat embellished) relationship that introduce each chapter. They are written by Marianne for a gossip newspaper, anonymously, which gives the story an interesting twist.The downside: the hero and heroine's feelings are a bit superficial. She doesn't want to marry except for true love, he doesn't believe in it (even though, of course, he is in love). His ignorance over his feelings lasts too long to be quite convincing and she doesn't appear to be too heartbroken when it does not seem to work out."
1,one more bratty heroine,"If I have to read one more book with a bratty female main charachter who won't marry the male main charachter, I think I will SCREAM. I raised 3 teenage daughters. It was frustrating. I don't enjoy reading about self centered, self absorbed 18 year olds who put some stupid fool of a man through hoops because he won't say ""I Love You"". The ending of the book was just stupid. They deserve each other. I finally just went to the last chapter direct from the middle of the book so I could be done with it and pitch it into the round file.I have just crossed Victoria Alexander off my ""authors to read"" list."
1,SIGHTS AND SOUNDS OF NATURE,"This has to be one of the Worst items I've seen . Beautiful photography ruined by aterrible Soundtrack . Item is supposed to be for meditation and relaxation but whilewatching the music sound wants to make you throw something at the T.V.Why would one think the sounds of blaring horns, booming drums and crashing cymbals would be relaxing ?"
5,Would buy from again!,The game and book are in very excellent condition! No problems with the game! Received a lot sooner than was expected! Will buy from again!
5,natives are restles,"What a beautiful recording. I was really impressed with Greg's fingerpicking. Garcia's Last Stand sets the pace for this great listening experience. Two songs were recorded ""live"" in Oceanside, Ca. at a coffee house. Greg has played with musicians like Steve Miller , Van Morrison, and Tom Johnston to name a few. He even has time to teach guitar with his busy schedule. Buy this c.d. It's money well spent."
2,Not exactly a great collection,"If you're expecting to hear some of the ""greatest hits"" of the jazz era, you're going to be sorely dissapointed to find out that most of them aren't here. True, there is Sing, Sing, Sing (the complete original) and some other nice songs, but there's no reason to buy this CD over some much better collections. Also, many of the recordings (being the originals) have the very old sound quality of a record, marring some of the older and better tracks. This CD can make a good space filler, and probably can help avid jazz collectors find some nice recordings they may not have, I would have to strongly recomend something else for someone just looking for a nice jazz collection."
3,Just an average home theatre system,"I got this one from circuit city for $199. Here are the pros and cons:1) Setup was very straight forward and simple2) Sound quality was good and there was no distortions at high volumes3) Integrated very well with my Samsung LCD Television and the same remote worked for both.The cons:1) The upscaling dvd player with HDMI output made no difference compared to my simple dvd player with component video cables.2) When you play music, you cannot navigate your cd/dvd simultaneously. You have to stop what is playing and only then you can navigate through your music. This was a major pain.3) The system takes a long time to load movies/music and even to open the dvd tray, it takes a long time (as long as 30+ seconds). Thats irritating too.In the end I returned this to circuit city for a refund and am currently doing my research as to which home theater system should I be purchasing."
3,NO Headphone Jack!,"I bought this for $220 at Fry's on Friday, and didn't get around to start setting it up until Monday. I was about to hook it up when I realized there was no headphone jack. I even called Samsung just to make sure I couldn't get some sort of accessory or something for it. No headphone jack. I brought it back and got the HT-x70. The HT-x50 and 70 have headphone jacks, but the 50 was silver, and I wanted all black. And now since they are 5 disc systems, it doesn't fit on the bookcase shelf I reserved for it. Other than that I am so far quite impressed with the 70, so I be the HT-x40 is good, if you don't care about using headphones. (The HT-x70 is quite loud, so I need the headphones if I'm going to get along with housemates."
4,Very nice stuff,It's obviously not state of the art ....but it has exellent sound and came in a timely manner......decent versatility to the settings....for the price a real bargin
3,Adequate,"It's a good functional piece of electronics. The video quality is adequate, but not substantially better than the basic DVD player that I already owned. The sound quality is good for the price point.I have two main complaints, both centered around the fact that it doesn't interact as smoothly with the Samsung LCD television that I just bought as I would expect:- When turned on (HDMI input), it automatically takes over the television. If you then switch sources while the player is on, even if the content is paused, you can't switch back without resetting the entire system. This is doesn't happen if you use AVI inputs, but then the picture quality is reduced.- I expected the upconversion to be more intelligent, and to maintain a 4:3 aspect when the source is 4:3. Instead it automatically goes to 16:9. This is annoying, but can be fixed at the TV level.Overall this is a reasonable system for the price. It is also something I will upgrade when I put together a full media room in the future."
2,Waste of Money,"This system seemed like a bargain and worked just fine for about 6 months but then the player had trouble syncing audio with video, would get stuck loading discs and have to be reset and now, after only about 18 months of occasional use, the front display (the little LCD screen) has gone out. Everything seems to work well enough but it's anyone's guess what function you're on since the screen doesn't display anymore. Hate to chuck it but there seems to be no solid answer as to how to fix it on any website I've searched. Too bad; I thought Samsung made better stuff than that."
2,Samsung HT-X40 Short Life,"I bought this unit about 18 months ago, the set up was easy, the sound quality was ok, the dvd player controls were sometimes confusing, the unit is out of warranty and died. I wouldn't recommend this unit. For $200 it should have lasted longer than 18 months."
2,Cheap and short-lived,"I bought this at Fry's for $99 on Black Friday sale. It comes with 1 year manufacturer warranty and during the first year it died 3 times with ""protection"" error and had to send to their repair center. Samsung paid for the shipping, thats not a problem but after it broke for the forth time Samsung refused repairing it. I am giving it 2-star because it never worked consistently for even 3 months but since I got it for $99 I will give it more than 1-star.I finally got Sony and I am quite happy."
1,"Great curb appeal, poor performance!","Hi there,I have had this system since fall 2007 and though it may work okay if you just want to watch TV it performs poorly for movies. I bought a SWA-3000 Wireless Receiver Module so that I wouldn't need cords to wrap my living room for the rear speakers. Though this sound system is wireless ready, it has a hard time maintaining the receiver's speakers! So when we would watch a movie the rear speakers wouldn't work half the time! Also to really feel the movie, you have to just turn up the volume, but then it is over saturated and you loose all depth in the sound quality. On another note, the DVD player portion would dub poorly with the sound to screen . . . the sound would not match the mouths of the actors. And to top it off, when watching movies the screen will go blank even though the sound of the movie will continue! If Circuit City were still in business I would trade this in!"
1,Undependable junk!,"This unit does have good sound, but that's where it ends. The controls are very user unfriendly and no other remotes will operate it. It went completely dead in two months. Samsung has the worst, most unfriendly customer service I have ever seen. I had to pay $30.00 to ship it to them and when I got it back the dvd player kept getting worse and finally died. While it was in the shop I used a $28 Apex player out of my rv and the picture actually looked better. Now, when you try to play a dvd it just says ""disc unknown"" and shuts off. My warranty expired two weeks ago. Never again will I buy Samsung."
4,So strange and so real...,"Joe Meek was an eccentric English record producer who has a cult following nowadays. He produced this album in 1960, but it never came out. It's a concept album about life on the moon. It is an instrumental album, other than the title song, which has lyrics. It is a very strange album, telling the stories of the beings who live on the moon through oddball instrumentals. Despite all the weirdness, it's actually a pleasant album to listen to. If you are interested in music that's a little ""out there"", you should give it a listen."
5,Great Supplement,"Reliable brand, great product. I have been using Source Naturals products for many years & know the importance of magnesium. I trust Source Naturals."
4,I take this at bedtime.,I take two pills at bed time to help me fall asleep. It helps relax and calm my mind down. I do get vivid dreams sometime. I like this.
5,Seems to help,"After reading a previous post about using for Migrains, thought I would give it a try. Seems to be helping so far."
3,Engineer/Modeler responds,"This set of tapes was a very good idea by someone. The photography and films are very nice, and show trains in action and many aspects of trains and railroading not usually seen. However, the producers really should have remastered the sound, as some of the soundtracks are almost unintelligible. A very nice try, but short."
4,Detailed and enjoyable,"Diplomacy conveys the history of international relations from the 1600s to the 1990s. Concepts of Reason d'etat, Realpolitik, Containment and the reasoning of nations' behaviour with one another are introduced and their implementations are clearly illustrated.Historical lessons are provided from French Expansion, German unification, the World Wars, and the Cold War. The American policies of the 20th Century are the focus of this book. The personalities involved are very detailed I enjoyed the sharing of Dr. Kissinger's personal stories with the likes of Truman, Nixon, Ford and Reagan.I did however notice the basic omission of Jimmy Carter's term and Carter's work towards peace between Israel and Egypt. Some may be disappointed because this book only covers up the the early 1990s(written in 1994) but other books like Huntington's ""Clash of the Civilizations"" should fill that gap."
3,"Not profound, not ambitious, but interesting","Kissinger is a very talented man. He knows how to develope his idea with plain language, and more important he knows how to make people laugh! But except <The World Restoration>, his doctoral thesis, his books are not academic. Those who want to study serious theories of diplomatic history in it should buy other books. Those who want to study Kissinger should find a lot of Kissingers in it. <Diplomacy> is a book for fun not for study. You can read it in the subway and the bus but not in the library."
3,A mixed bag,"Kissinger's analysis of REalpolitik is strong. But, he underestimate's Hitler's diplomatic skill, overestimates the Wilsonian beliefs of the leaders of the 30s, and writes sentences in musty formulae( 'it is a measure of__that________' or 'they had forgotten____-if indeed they[or he] had ever known it'.)He is terribly repetitive, and makes odd comparisons to keep the reader interested. Excluding his repetitions and digressive comparisons would knock off a hundred pages. Finally, his taste for balance-of-power, Realpolitik, and statesmen like Bismarck and Disraeli seems more nostalgic than reasoned."
3,Very Insightful But Slow,"A well written and developed book with a number of good insights logically put together. However, at the pace it is written it's more like a college text -- kind of slow -- than a good adult read."
1,LIES LIES LIES,"Dispite the fact that history has been altered in this book, Kissinger fails to achive his goal, to propagandize the American tactic and policy of his era and after. The title of this this book book should be at least ""Uncle Sam's Farm of animals""."
5,The best manual ever written on international relations,"In this book, the US Secretary of State clearly reveals how international relations work and help us to undertand why is the world in such a way nowadays.This book is a reading that all international relations student must read. It is the perfect manual to understand international relations since 17th. century through the post Cold War World.Sincere congratulations to Mr. Kissinger."
5,So intriguing you can't put it down,"Having recently become very interested in history and politics, I can't say enough about how informative and exciting this book is. It gives even the novice like me an understanding of the events themselves, the reasons why governments acted the way they did, and a context of these events in their time and their benefits to America today. With more books like this we really can learn from our mistakes."
4,Not 100% objetive,"The book itself gives you the opportunity to relive the history of the world's pollitical balance of the twentieth century. It can be considered a prime source of information because Kissinger was an important character during Cold War negotiations for the United States. It is really worth it because of the way it's written. However, I believe many of his opinions are not very impartial. That diminishes its value as an objective and historical study. I recommend that anyone who's planning to read it gets to know some history before in order to understand him completely."
3,Henry Kissinger is successful in describing world Diplomacy.,"Doctor Henry Kissinger, the controversial American political character, establishes an easy to understand, opininiated descrpition of world diplomacy over the last century and a half. It's a little long, and I beiieve it's very redundant. It's not a book to carefully read, but a brisk skimming will allow you go gain the knowledge that this book offers. A glossary would of helped. The maps and pictures are nice. Mike Stanton would be proud as Henry K displays his no nonsense attitude! Anyway, if you are taking a high school or college world history class, be sure to pick up a copy. It'll take long to read but it's worth it. It's not written to CLEARLY, I wouldn't reccomend it to my family and friends, but to my peer students. 29. 21."
3,"Excellent watch, but limited by Amazon's digital distribution methods","As of right now, I don't think I am able to download this video onto my phone or onto other computers...although I do praise the video itself, Cho-Liang Lin and others provide excellent commentary and wonderful playing of Vivaldi. A bit nostalgic and environmentally outspoken."
4,"Oh man, I was disappointed","Don't get me wrong, this is a good mix, but Danny can do a helluva alot etter. He is known for fusing Hip-Hop with Jungle, and he didn't do any of this on his CD. I've never seen him live, but alot of my friends have, and from what they told me about him, I was disappointed when I heard this mix. The only reason I didn't rate this at a ""3"" is for two reasons. One, Danny's scratching is totally off glass, and is very good with the mix. Second, his track selection is decent (Like AK1200's ""Deep Porn VIP"")! I recommend this CD for those of you out there that don't like Amen, Progressive, Tech-Step, or Jump-Up, and are really into Roller and Hardstep...no crazy-[butt] rinseout tracks on here."
3,could be better,"I was very excieted when i bought this cd, since i have been a fan of danny's for a while, but after listening i was a little disapointed. There is nothing wrong with the cd, but it could have been better. One of the main reasons that i like danny is his use of hip hop in his mixing. Sadly there is not much on this alblum. Maybe I was expecting too much, or maybe i just own too many other jungle cd's, because this just sounds mediocre to me."
3,"Works fine, but may not be able to get same filters","I bought this product about a year ago to replace the bottle my dad would refill himself at the grocery store. I think the water tastes fine, but he says he liked the other one better. Oh well, this one is much more convenient. The filters that came with the bottle had an orange indicator to let you know when they needed to be replaced, but the filters I found in stores no longer have an indicator, so that's annoying. On the bright side, the filters that came with the bottle lasted OVER A YEAR, and it's used quite a bit, so I'm going to have to trust that the new filters will last about the same amount of time. A year later, I'd say it was a good buy ($20 a year for me--since you need 2 filters and they're about $10 each)."
