2,Cold and calculating,"I would've appreciated this book so much more if Carolyn came across as a candid, warm person with a sense of humor. Instead it seems as though she's an automaton whose entire life is her work. She even refers to her family as the ""Kepcher Organization"" and calls her parents ""team captains."" Agh!But what truly annoyed me about this book is how she fell all over herself gushing about Trump, yet went out of her way to badmouth each of her prior bosses. Not a chapter goes by when she doesn't make a point of flattering Donald Trump in some way -which, I suppose, is to be expected - although it didn't help her authenticity in any way.In the end, I wish she came across as a real person with real life lessons. Her advice didn't ring true to me."
2,Suitable for fresh employees,"I was disappointed with this book after reading all the rave reviews others had submitted. Carolyn touched on a wide range of topics briefly, and most of her advice would be applicable to people fresh out of school, as those who have already been working for a while would have encountered those situations and found a way to manage them by now."
5,"Bought it, read it, loved it!","This book helps everyone understand the roles they are in and how to understand others roles around them. Her advise is useful and insightful. For instance when you change bosses inside a company not everyone realizes they have to prove themselves all over again to the new boss. Very little credit, if any, is given to the great job you did for the last boss which leads to confusion and not adapting to the change you have expierienced.It was also very entertaining as she has a way of getting quickly and concisely to the heart of the matter."
1,Not worth your money,I was really disappointed with this book for two reasons: 1) Carolyn praised Donald Trump throughout the entire book (I understand that she is very grateful for working for Mr. Trump but she comes off more like a starry-eyed love sick puppy. 2) She really did not provide any real business tips beside those that are pretty much common sense.This book was not worth the money if she writes another book I will make sure I check it out from the library first before spending anymore money.
3,Only good,"Althogh some chapters are good remainders of what a good manager must do / must behave, it's quite boring sometimes to read so many praises for her boss (now former boss).I'm happy I bougth it used (US$ 1)."
3,exactly what i wanted to know,"when watching the apprentice i was always facinated by this young blond WOMAN sitting on the left side of one the most powerful men in the world. i wanted to know about her, how the heck did she attain such a position that most people men and women alike sell their souls for every day.After reading this book, lets just say i was... satisfied. She really didn't tell me anything i didn't know in her tips, but her life story had me captivated."
3,a must read for apprentice wannabes,"This is a must read for anyone wanting to audition for upcoming ""Apprentice"" shows. Kepcher's advice is sound.But if you're seeking ""Master of the Universe"" type wisdom, keep looking. Or better yet, go buy one of The Donald's tomes.""Carolyn 101"" offers up business protocol and negotiation as pristine and sanitized as the golf courses the author runs, but it is not a true guts, grit and glory book of masterful deal making. This is not to say Kepcher ISN'T masterful. She is. Her best gem, continuous throughout the pages, is how to artfully ass kiss your boss! Details of Trump's numerous successes are expounded on often. Bottom line: This book's worth the cover price, but it's not five star advice. What would be ""five star"" is Kepcher's tales of Trump-land... twenty years from now. Looking forward to that!"
3,Practical and Sharp but nothing outside the Box,"you know reading this makes me think: If your on TV you can write a book.the book is practical and sharp, just like I thought it should be comming from an ice queen. But I really didnt read anything that is outside the box.If your looking for your first book about business management, I recommend this."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"The worst business book I've ever read. All style and no substance. If you're desiring information from ""The Apprentice"", spend your money on Bill Rancic's book."
4,Good basic DVD recorder,"The recorder requires a bit of initial effort and possibly help to use, but once you figure it out, it seems to work well. There are 5 levels of quality with this recorder - the one hour is fine, the 2 and 3 1/2 hour quite good and the others fair. This does not replicate the quality of an original dvd but I have been happy with it.My only complaint is the poor range of the remote control. The manufacturer's customer service tells me that this is a common situation with this machine."
3,It's not what I was looking for but it works,When you look at the photo of the item it looks like the grip has a vertical shutter release on it like those that attach on the D300s. I was disappointed that it did not have a vertical release but it does everything else I was looking for. There were no glitches in the battery and the grip definitely helped to give me more hand room and stabilization.
1,Don't waste your money,"Does it power the camera? Yes. Does the cheap plastic thumb screw strip? Yes. Is it stuck on my camera? Yes. Is there any way to tell if the battery is charged? No. Is there any way to know what the colored LED's mean? No. Is there any way to know what the button does? No. Does it come with any instructions or any literature whatsoever? No. Would I recommend it to a friend? If it was $10 or less, this might be a good alternative to the other options available. But it just sucks. It's cheap feeling, doesn't match the look or feel of the d40, and the stupid thing is stripped and stuck on my camera."
1,MMR-60 Fm Music Transmitter,"You had better live in the boonies to use this thing. It would barely work in my car (too many radio stations available) it would work so-so in my house, although the ten meter range it supposedly has is laughable, the only way it would work in my house was to lean it up against the receiver.That is why I returned it to Amazon.All in all I would stay away from this unless you are in an area that has next to no FM stations."
4,pretty cool,"I was a little skeptical about buying the transmitter after reading some of the reviews, but I took a chance. And I'm glad I did. I haven't had much issues with it except that the range is about less than one foot from the radio I use to listen through. But that's okay because I just sit it right on top of the radio and have clear music coming out. People that come into my office don't even realize that the music is from another source. They are always amazed to find out it's from my phone. I would buy it again if need be."
2,Good Idea - Poor Execution,"Maybe this works better in locations with fewer radio stations or other interference sources, but the sound quality is really pretty poor."
2,SonyEricsson FM transmitter,"Very poor reception on radio in my Chevy Blazer. I've tried various frequencies from low through high on the ""dial"". It seems that if I hold the transmitter it is better or if I place it as close to the antenna as possible (right side of dash). Both of these options are not practical. It was a waste of money - a ""toy"" that will end up in the bottom of the toybox."
4,Good Buy,"I use this product in my car, so i can listen to all my mp3's in my w810, and i have to say sony ericsson is the best in the market when talking about mobile phones, music and gadgets together.4 stars because it does not have a wide range of transmision but i'm using it in my car and it's great"
4,"It works well, but it has some warts","It works for me, but the range is a bit short. Its more convenient than using an annoying wire and cassette adapter, but it chews up the battery pretty fast and there is no way to charge the phone while the transmitter is connected. However, I am not able to charge the phone with a Sony Ericsson Multimedia Music Cable MMC-70 connected either.Personally, I do not like Sony Ericsson's universal plug design. I want a separate charging plug and a separate 3.5mm headphone jack as well. Hard to imagine how such an obvious oversight can be overlooked."
3,"Works great, interface is loose with phone, but all seem to be.",I installed this on a C905 and have been using it for about a year. It works in very close proximity and is crystal clear. The interface seems to be jarred loose easily which prevents practical automotive use... but you can use an I-pod plug-in and the Sony headphone adapter to direct connect to your deck in the car(another adapter may be required depending on deck model) for a solid connection.
1,Sony FM Music Transmitter,"I bought this FM Music Transmitter to use it with my Sony Ericsson K790 Cel phone in my car an office stereo, but it doesn't work well. Even though the manual says that it works within 10 meters, it only works at 10 cms. and with a lot of interference in the car and in my office/home stereo I have to place it on the back of the stereo, near the antenna connector. If I knew that it worked so badly I wouldn't have bought it."
2,"Great idea, but lousy performance and power hungry!","Like most all the other reviews, surprisingly this product from Sony (made in Sweden) does not perform well at all, period.Even though I too read the other reviews here before buying, I hoped they were wrong and I went ahead and purchased this item. Don't waste your time.It does work, but it has to be right near the radio source, but even then it gives you static. On top of that, it uses alot of power from your phone battery. Great idea, but Sony needs to go back to the drawing board on this one."
3,fair,Works much better in rural areas than the city. If you have a sony or other conpatible phone the MBR-100 is a bluetooth reciever that hooks to your car and works much better.
2,signal is weak with second class sound,I literally have to have the phone along with inserted transmitter sitting on my dashboard in order to get a somewhat clear signal. I've attempted several different channels with no luck. It was a bit pricey too.
4,hitachi planer,"The jointer bed is too small for this to be the perfect machine. The planer is excellent, but the total length of the infeed and outfeed bed is very short and makes it difficult to accurately joint long pieces of wood. The first thing that I did after buying this was to buy a 71"" powermatic jointer. It is not the most economical way to go.The exhaust tends to get plugged in both the planer and the jointer with wood chips."
2,Mini Camo Skirt,I ordered the camo mini in a large size for women and it is more like junior sizing. Will keep it becos I don't to hassle with a return for one item.
5,Absolutely Superb!,"I just finished reading this book and I had to slow down because I did not want it to end. This was a wonderful book. I loved every minute of it. The Stanfield's clan was so twisted. But it made for exciting reading. I fell in love with little Rafi. He was so adorable. The love between Logan and Kelly was so touching. Tears streamed down my eyes several times. Logan really does sound like a man to die for. The things he went through during his childhood just broke my heart. I'd love to read more about Logan, Kelly, Pops, and Rafi. This was my first time reading Meryl Sawyer and now I must read more. This is one romantic suspense that I highly recommend. There is absolutely no way you could be disappointed. Go slow, because you will not want it to end. Enjoy."
4,Dogs love it and it can probably serve as a self defense weapon!,"It is HUGE, as is expected from a ""mammoth"" bone. We got one for out Great Dane puppy a few months ago, when she was just 4 months, and she loved it. It was so cute to watch her try to carry out, but we only give it her so often. She will do many tricks to earn access to it time and time again. Although its huge and could last forever I threw out the first one after a month or so because I didnt want her eating through the whole thing and it does not have a pleasant odor. But if you want bang for you buck and have a big/giant breed dog its a no-brainer. I recently went to the pet store with LeeLoo and bought her 2nd mammoth bone there ($17.99- amazon is superior in that area) and oh wow, after I picked it up she was soo excited, and Im lucky as she isnt a hyper-excited but a ""Im-going-to-be-really-focused-on-that-bone-so-you-know-I-want-it-as-I-behave-better-than-usual-now-so-that-you-bestow-that-glorious-bone-upon-me"" well."
1,Bad Bone,"I bought this item prior to christmas 2011, and once it arrived i gave it to my dog, who (of course) began slobbering all over it. He spent the next 2 days, after i threw the bone away, vomiting all over everything. I dont know if i got a bad item, or if they are all like this, but i would strongly recommend going elsewhere for your pets chew-toy needs."
3,The dog enjoyed it,"I purchased this for our mostly outdoor dog. As soon as I opened the bone, it fell apart into many pieces. The dog has enjoyed chewing it, but I would NEVER give this to a dog in the house. It is very messy. After getting this, I found the local butcher sells bones for a couple of dollars, and they are clean and fresh. We will go that route next time."
3,My dog was not interested,The bone is impressively large. The size did not disappoint at all. What was disappointing is that my dog didn't seem too interested in it. I'm not sure why. But I made the mistake of buying two. I should have just bought one to see if my dog would like it. Just something to consider.
5,Big Bone,I have a small dog and this is a big big bone. She can't even use it. It will last a life time!
4,Best Idea I've Had!,"My daughter has a puppy who LOVES dog bones but always seems to go through the raw-hide bones too quick and anything on the small/medium size wouldn't last more than an hour, at most. She had bought one of these bones and, let me tell you, they are HUGE! When they say ""Mammoth"" they mean it. We gave it to her 8 month old Lab/Great Dane mix puppy and she just went to town. Its so big that after 3 days of chewing on it, she just started to make a dent. I would deffinatly recommend this for those who have dogs that love to eat dog bones or are heavy chewers.Pros. : It lasts longer than normal sized bones and its naturalCons. : When you take it out of the plastic wrapping, pieces of it will fall everywhere! I do not recommend letting your dog eat it anywhere but tyle or wood floor (and even then, the first few minutes is still bad)"
2,Upset Tummy,While my dog really enjoyed this for a few hours before going to bed the next morning she threw up all her dinner. This did not sit well with her tummy. So I don't think she will be getting it back to finish it. It still has quite a bit on it. Buyer beware if your dog has a delicate stomach. I really wish this would have worked.
3,So-So..but not too bad,"When it arrived, the box was kind of beat up...and my brother's Siberian Husky kept staring at it.He definitely knew something in the box was for him.The wrapping was rather difficult to open, very messy and a chunk of the ""bone"" fell off...I didn't trust that chunk so I tossed it...After the flavor's gone, the pooch got bored fast...it's very heavy, and he'd rather Try to feast on my 65$ shoes again...BooIt's not bad, because it does keep him busy for a few weeks.But, for the price I paid, I want the bone gone and him very happy with it after a long long time."
4,I got this for my pitbull's 6 month birthday,"He loved the bone, it was good quality but he slowly dismantled it, it's lasted longer than any other bone, however, I expected it to be larger, but he liked it so that's all that really matters!"
1,not worth it!,"dogs played with it for a while,I wanted to order another one when i stumbled on the same bone at raleys for way less than what i paid here. will deff not get this stuff again,I suggest to get a real raw meaty bones,they will cost less,plus they are way better for your dogs,not only for their teeth but they have vitamins in them."
5,Two small dogs,Ok I have two small daogs so I bought them this massive bone for the back yard where they could just sit on the patio and enjoy! Which is what they did-they spent hours chewing away and they have not made a dent. So if you have small dogs this is a treat that will REALLY last and last!
5,We have one happy dog!,"First off, this is a great price for this ginormous bone. I ordered a few other items at the same time, so they all came together in a big box. When I opened the box, the plastic over the bone was torn open on one side. So all the ""meat"" spilled out on the other items. (not a big deal. But it would have been nice if the bone was a little more padded, secluded or SOMEthing). Also, remember to open this bone over a bag or something because when I took the rest of the plastic off..it immediately fell apart in 3 big pieces and tons more crumbs to follow. For these reasons...it lost one star (in my heart).However, I expected my dog to tear it apart as it is and make a big mess. That was inevitable. But our dog loves it so much, he picks up all the tiny morsels himself. The fact this bone last a very long time and has brought our dog loads of happiness and less boredom makes all of us happy too. So that extra star gets to be back on!"
5,"This is a little embarrassing, but...","When they say mammoth, they mean mammoth.I thought I was buying a bone on the large side. Uh, the thing weighs a ton and looks like the shin bone of a cow. Or a dinosaur. It's 18"" long. It would take my dog about a year of gnawing, but he'd be happy the whole time."
5,Dogs loved it!,"i have a Pit Bull, Queensland Heeler and a mutt, they all loved the bone... I let them chew on it for a little while everyday.. sometimes big chunks break off and I usually take those from them (Im paranoid the piece will get stuck and choke them) .. I recommend you supervise your pup when they're chewing on these, just to be safe.. Highly recommended, especially for bigger dogs."
5,Lasts a long time!,"When these bones arrived, my dog KNEW that something inside the box was for her. On Christmas day, we opened up the box and unwrapped one of her bones. The knuckle fell off (i'm assuming it got tossed around a lot in shipping) but no worries, Munchkin ate that as well. We put the bone on her blanked she normally uses to play on to help keep the mess down. Munchkin, a 100-pound 8 month-old Newfoundland is STILL working on her bone. Lasts a long time and provides hours of chewing time!"
5,Mammoth bones are HUGE,"I bought two of these for my daughter's dogs. They were literally ""stunned""by the size. Her larger dog would not leave the bone. She finally had to take it from him so he would go for a walk! The smaller dog (30 pounds) could barely lift her bone. I highly recommend this product, if just for the amusement factor, but the dogs loved to chew them also. probably not appropriate for a small space or a tiny dog."
4,it kiks @$$,"In the States, you're not that exposed to foreign bands. I saw these guys live and kickn' with Sevendust and Godsmack. As far as moshin' and crowd envolvement, these guys put on the best show. Once I saw them, I had to get their cd which was well worth it."
2,Dissapointing but Ok,"From the Reviews I believed this would be a great Cd, but personally I found it very dissapointing, Though they have some good lyrics, the rest of their sound is lacking, the Riffs are repetetive and tired, and the sampling used often gets annoying."
2,Not impressed,"Some nice heavy guitar licks, but they're still the poor man's Rage against the machine..sorry!"
3,Nu/Rap Metal formula used all over again.,"The songs New Dogs New Tricks and Pig Until Proven Cop are of good quality, but the rest just is repetative rap with guitars. The guys are trying to acheive a certain sound, but, with this album, fail to achieve it.Listening to this, it reminds me on the nu-metal scene of France...just that the style does not work in English. Pleymo is a great example.The album has got strenghts and weaknesses, sadly the style is already made, been created by many bands and OMS is just taking parts of this style and using it to make a new style."
5,Best Spaghetti,Was told about this by Italian women. She said if you didn't have time to make your own sauce this was a good substitute. Substitute? I'm never making sauce again!
1,Outrageously Overpriced,This text is basic at best and outrageously overpriced. The description implies that it is comprehensive. There is nothing in the text that cannot be found on the internet for free. It is easy to compair this text with the others listed and see that it is seven times more expensive than most all other sign langage texts. I bought it thinking it would provide what was not readily available.Buyer Beware!!
1,WRONG LANGUAGE!!!!!,"There was nothing in your ad that said anything about this book being in SPANISH. So therefore I received this book and of course I don't speak spanish. Thanks for wasting not only my time but my money. I will not order anything from Amazon again, since I am not sure that I will be able to read it."
4,Pretty good,"Tree Dog Night was a popular band in this part of the world in their time, but has lost it to the state of unknown lately. A pity - they had a lot of talent."
5,Awesome album,"Truly the best of three dog night. Music today, really needs to look at how it was done back then, time to get back to the real music,"
2,Where's the lead guitar on Joy to the World??,"I love the songs, such good memories, they have a good sound, but I'm really disappointed with the fact that ""Joy to the World"" is missing the lead guitar during the instrumental after the second verse. This could be a deal changer for some. I wish I knew this before I bought."
3,I could have had a V-8,Ok CD; just feel like my older brother is back on the skids and moved back home and taken over my room again. Brings back traumatic childhood memories; some great songs however. Worth the money.
2,Three Engelberts Unite,"I never got it. In the midst of Zeppelin, Sabath, Elton, Doobies, Stones, Santana, Humble Pie etc. you had these guys singing in front of a backup band and singing stuff like ""One"" and ""Jeremiah Bullfrog"" or whatever. Man, if I want to hear the Righteous Bros then I will listen to them. My wife picked up this CD and it didn't do it for me then and it still just hits me as top 40 70's ish pap. I don't even know what kind of music this is - maybe Vegas? For you fans of this type of stuff, I guess it is good stuff."
1,Not good,"When I bought this, I thought I would enjoy the nostalgia. But, I don't. The production values are poor, the lyrics are inane and quality musicianship is absent. The melody and arrangement of the music leaves everything to be desired. If you must relive the 70's by Tapestry. This music simply doesn't stand the test of time. I give it 0 stars."
2,Not Enough Here,"An improvement over an earlier ""Greatest Hits"" compilation, this CD still falls short, and fans should invest in the more thorough collection, ""Celebrate,"" which also includes great liner notes from the band members. This CD is recommended only for those who need a slim collection of only the biggest hits. No liner notes."
2,All over the wrong place,"I tried to write a synopsis of this film after watching it, but to be honest I had no idea what to say. I mean, I watched the film, I understood roughly what it was about, but I could not write a synopsis. I think the main reason I struggled to do this, is because the film tries to do too much in such a short space of time. We are literally thrown into the midst of several character's stories, and then expected to sift through it all as we draw towards the conclusion. The fact that we are told very little about each of the characters we meet, makes this process all the more difficult.Although this is a very impressive looking and well-acted independent film (shot for $750,000), I think that in the end it would have benefited from tightening its focus more on the central characters involved in the bomb plot, and examining their motives for executing this."
2,Fat what?,"Kinda interesting...plot was OK but predictable. Acting was pretty bad. Hard to believe that a U.S. Senator can walk around, shop at ""cutesy"" boutiques without any kind of assistant or bodyguard.If Lauren Holly would have shown her nekkid sweater puppies or her goody box, I would have watched this one again. She didn't and the movie suffered from it."
2,a very scary terrorist,"The plot revolves around a loanshark and his confederates. The cabby/terrorist is really a backdrop to the major scenes but brilliantly done. You actually have to believe these people really exist. The girlie and sex segments are probably the worst I've seen in contemporary cinema. The gore is too much and too long. The actors go from ""right on"" to miscast.Perhaps, on a larger budget, this indie could have given Mr. Carter more time for a broader perspective."
3,Kind of fun.,"A gift for my 13 year old cousin. He liked them, and it was a fun stocking stuffer. He thought they were pretty fun. The writing isn't as bright as I expected it to be when you shine the black light on it."
5,great product,"I'm very happy with my entire purchase. I used to be able to purchase pear fantasy in my local drug stores and K -marts but haven't been able to find it for at least a year. It is one of my friend's favorite scent so I purchased it for her birthday, She was so happy because she also has not been able to find it. Two friends completely satisfied in NY. Thank you very much."
4,Good CD from a great band,"I have loved listening to Ingram Hill since first hearing them on Launchcast Radio. They are a perfect example of a pop band who knows what they are and what they do best. It might not land them on MTV but it does make for an enjoyable listen. If I had to pigeon-hole them into a category, I would put them in with bands like Train, The Badlees and to a lesser extent Counting Crows.I like their follow up CD-""Cold in California"" a little bit more than I do this CD...but not by much!"
5,IH Lover,"This is an awesome cd. I have been a fan of Ingram Hill for a very long time. Just listen to the whole cd once through.....on the next time through, you will know the chorus of every song. Evry song gets you singing along....you just cant help it. I would HIGHLY reccommend this awesome cd!"
5,Ingram Hill is Awesome,"I stumbled across Ingram Hill at a Gavin DeGraw concert. They opened for Gavin and Michael Tolcher. After the concert, walking to my car, the only song I was singing was by Ingram Hill. The CD is amazing! Every single song on the CD is good. If you like pop/rock, you'll love this cd."
3,A bit of a disappointment,"I was kinda generous in giving this 3 stars just because I love ""Will I Ever Make it Home"". I have to say that most of the CD is boring with the exception of the track following WIEMIH."
5,gregorian chants,=I love gregorian chants but I especially love track 8 - Dies Irae. I listen to it everyday many times! Beautiful!
5,We had to have this after we saw it on Mythbusters,"This is a handy little reference book, but despite its small size, it has information on just about everything."
1,Amazon is confused,"Amazon somehow listed this Christiana Moffa CD under ""Trinity,"" a piano solo written and performed by George Flynn. I hope this confusion can be corrected."
5,Great tool for couples and sex therapists!,This is a clearly-written little book with fun suggestions for exercises in intimacy. I highly recommend it!
3,A bit New Agey but interesting,This book definitely made my husbandLaugh! I guess I don't get some of this tantric stuff but nonetheless some of the suggested exercises definitely spice up ones sex life and make you laugh!! The strength of the book is that it promotes a healthy dialogue between a couple about what they want sexually. Learning to be more playful goes along way to improve a couples sex life. But don't be disappointed if you don't get in touch with your inner flute! :)
2,Disappointing,"I think all the songs - or at least most - are wonderful, however, I think that the depth and nuance of Rita Coolidge's voice have been lost in this remastering. I think it is particularly noticeable in the selections with Kris Kristofferson, whose distinctive sound has been totally mellowed in this album. Not what I'm looking forward in both these wonderful artists."
4,"A Great Collection, oh so close to perfection....except","It was fantastic to finally get her first, regional hit, ""Turn Around and Love You,"" on CD. While I bought the original Pepper Records single in the 60's, I hadn't heard it in years. It's still as strong a recording as ever and a wonderful addition here.Unfortunately, whoever did the track selections (and I've read elsewhere that Rita contributed), too many of my personal favorites were left off from her early albums, most of which are not currently available: ""Second Story Window,"" ""Most Likely You Go Your Way and I'll Go Mine,"" ""My Crew"", ""Heaven's Dream,"" ""Desperados Waiting for the Train."" That's why I couldn't give this otherwise great collection five stars. I definitely bought it, though, and certainly recommend this to anyone who might be considering it. It's a genuine bargain. Enjoy!"
2,Great moments of music,"It's been a while since I had this beautiful experience just listening music, coming along with marvelous Rita. I've been wondering why never before were reissued her incredibles ""Anytime...anywhere"", ""Love me again"" or ""Heartbreak radio"" on digital format. So finally, with this anthology I have at least in part, the opportunity to enjoy her art."
3,picture smaller than desribed,"i already submitted a rating & review of this item, was contacted again by the seller & asked to change it, did not & now you're asking for it again. please refer to original & please quit bothering me & accept my initial review & rating of service. as you can see i have ordered numerous times before & usually give positive ratings, save this purchase."
4,Superb Medical Thriller,"A serial killer with a grudge against doctors at an L.A. hospital and the expertise to imitate each of his victims' medical specialties stalks the hospital halls, and forensic pathologist Joanna Blalock must stop him before she becomes the next victim. Just like the first book, you don't even have a clue who the killer is until the last 50 pages. This book was really hard to put down. If you're into medical thrillers, start this series!"
3,Weak vocals,"The vocals on this, especially the male voice on the Prest part, are really weak and intimate in comparison to the soaring voices on the recording I prefer: the blue double-CD with the London SO I believe. I was unhappy with this Naxos but I've only heard two versions (plus one of the Suite) so I'm not prepared to give this worse than a three."
5,Customer Loyalty: Quick Hitting and Practical,"When your corporate name is ""Spartan Computer Services,"" and your primary competitor is IBM Global Services, there is no room for error. We cannot be good; we have to better, much better. If our customers are merely satisfied--and we deal with the most recognized names in the (demanding) restaurant industry--our services contracts would last as long as it takes IBM to process a ""special bid.""By using clear examples and sound business principles, Ms. Griffin cuts through the academic with a confidence and style of someone who has clearly ""walked the walk."" Buy ""Customer Loyalty,"" stuff it in the travel bag, pull it out on the next flight, and get ready to highlight. It is the definitive loyalty book and a ""must have"" resource for any company with loyalty ambitions."
5,Lerangis does it again,"This is a truly great novel. The plot is enticing, the characters are astonishing,and the amount of description is amazing. The series as a whole is good, but this is my favorite book thus far in the saga."
5,Great Collection !!,I love all the songs on this album. I recommend it to any fans of the Little River Band. Worth every penny.
3,Great Band!,"I didn't actually purchase this cd BUT I do have their greatest hits cd. I agree with one of the other posters that the song ""We Two"" is definitely UNDERRATED!! It's by far (IMO) the best song on the cd. It never gets airtime play. Same songs are played every day! There are so many other good songs to heart!! I haven't taken with the latest gadgets (ipod, etc) so I stick with listening to it on my stereo or find it on youtube."
5,SO GLAD TO HAVE GOTTEN THIS ON CD,"What can I say...this is one great audio CD! My wife and I bought every one of their 45s as they were released and some of their ""albums"" while we were dating. We love their up beat style...gets your feet movin'."
3,Remastered Sound Quality,"I have the original 1982 LRB Greatest Hits CD on Capital pressed by EMI MFG, 12 tracks. Please, anybody chime in on the sound quality of this remastered ""Definitive Collection"" CD. I have read the reviews on LRB ""Greatest Hits"" CD from 2000 with extra tracks and some of the reviews bash the ""remastered"" sound. I don't want to buy a ""brick-walled"" sound remaster. Thanks."
4,What Everybody Really Wants to Know,"Now that there is another greatest hits compilation of the Little River Band, what everybody really wants to know is: Is the version of ""It's a Long Way There"" the full-length original album version (9 plus minutes) or the standard single edit that is around 4 1/2 minutes. This is a big selling point for those who have been searching for the longer version in a ""remastered"" mordern format. To those people that have already purchased this disc, Please let all of us know, so we can decide if this is a must-by addition to our collections. Thank-you"
5,Smooth Harmony,"My era was Sinatra, Como, Crosby. Then Kingston Trio early 60's in SF. Don't know how I missed LRB. Arrangement, harmony, writing, rhythm. Definitive Collection has it!"
5,Amazing songs that pull on your heart-string,"Danny's awesome songwriting and lyric-writing skills crafted this collection of songs that God just breathed into life and now can touch your heart. Each song just pulls you in closer and closer and you're caught in the emotion and moment of the song. It won't be long before his flowing melodies ring in your head and soon enough you're singing along with Danny. Thank you Danny for letting us ""Breathe it in"" and sharing your heart and your life with the world. Your song for motherhood needs to be heard by so many Moms out there who labor in love doing the most un-appreciated job in the world. They need to hear your music. You're a talented songster! Keep up the great songwriting and guitar playing. I look forward to more of your work."
5,Om Trio's latest and greatest,"The Om trio - who recently called it quits due to financial contraints - always deserved a larger following than they had. Their music, while accessable and groove-laden, at the same time had complexity to it. Brian Felix, the keyboard player, often uses various effects to manipulate the sound of his instrument - in essence, quickly sampling himself. Ilya Stemkovsky stays in the pocket most of the time, dropping a handful of fills on the album, but when he does, they're huge. Pete Novembre follows a similar path. But to think of the band as a group of three individuals is the wrong way to go about it. Om trio's greatest achievement is that they sound like one unit, whereas often times trios like Medeski Martin and Wood sound like three guys trying to impress each other. The Om trio isn't trying to impress anyone; they're just trying to make good music, and they most definatly succeed."
3,"A little misleading, but nice","I was expecting a double-CD set of folk songs IN FOLK STYLES, but this volume actually only offers one such disc; the other is folk songs in OPERA/CLASSICAL STYLE. Although the execution of the classical disc is lovely...truly beautiful, I was disappointed that there was no mention of the difference before I bought ""Dumky."" The folk style CD is good, but also not quite what I was expecting. It's all good for listening and familiarizing oneself with Ukrainian folk songs, but not for understanding traditional folk styles. Not for the serious student of musical folk styles, in other words."
3,Was awesome for 4 years,Loved this TV for 4 good years. One day it just went black and some of the pixels turned red and blue and started jumping around like fireworks. The sound still works but we have no idea what happened. This shouldn't have occurred after only 4 years. Gave it 3 stars because picture was outstanding and sound is great. TV is very hot (as plasmas are) but otherwise no complaints.
1,BEWARE of TECH FOR LESS!!!!!,"I ordered one of these Tvs for my Niece from Tech for Less. It arrived with numerous electrical problems. There was no shipping damage, they shipped a defective TV and they knew it.Be VERY careful if you plan to purcahse anything from Tech for Less."
3,So Far So Good,"I had been comparing Compund Miter Saws for awhile now and debated between the DeWalt 12"" Dual Bevel and this Hitachi. I could not justify the additional $180 to go with the 12"" DeWalt. What I like about this saw is the soft start feature. This is a must, especially for a light saw (only weighs 33 lbs.). I do not like the fence height at only 1.5"", however for what I use it for, I don't think it will be a problem. I was willing to sacrifice this to get the soft start feature. On a side note, the extension wings and horizontal vise assemblies are NOT included and are an extra $25 each. I thought they were included since the technical data section and the picture displayed through this web site led me to believe this."
4,Russian Piano Recital by Mily Balakirev,I was asked to fing this cd by an elderly woman. She thouroughly enjoyed this CD. Was exactly what she wanted.
1,Outdated software,"This software works with Pocket PC version 2002 and ACT! Version 6.0 and earlier. While I do prefer the older ACT! version, I find the Pocket PC 2002 hard to find. Wish I had known before purchasing this software. Since I purchased it, I have also purchased CompanionLink, which is recommended by ACT! for use with my Pocket PC. It works perfectly with Outlook and ACT!. So, I am basically writing this review before I sell the program on Amazon to someone who has the Pocket PC version 2002 and also does not want to spend the ~$50 on CompanionLink...just in case that person might have Pocket PC 2002 and Act 6.0. Might make sure you also have Outlook 2002 so you don't get too far ahead of this old software. Cheers!"
2,Great for USA,"If you are tipping in USA or Canada, this is a good guide. It gives you the history of guiding as well as what's expected by whom and why. It's also good for learning how to report tips as part of your salary. It is not good for traveling overseas. There is no advice on what's appropriate in the 21st century as you travel abroad."
4,Buyer beware of quality,I feel bad doing this becuase I love Iggy and the stooges but the quality on this set is pretty bad. All the live recordings are worth listening to and probably owning but the quality is very rough and can get frustrating. It's like the first Beatles Anthology set: the material is amazing but the quality is bad. On the plus side the studio outtakes are decent quality wise and amazing content wise. The packaging is also very nice. I just though I'd share this information before you drop all the money on the set. If you are a Stooges fan don't hesitate purchase now but if this is your introduction you should probably wait.
4,This Album Is Great,"This is one of the most beautiful and sincere albums i have heard in a long time. Although i have always been a fan of his more stripped down acoustic live shows, the band comes off great on this record. The songs are just awesome. I highly recomend it to anyone looking for some good music."
2,You'll never get to heaven listening to this,"This guy needs to find his own musical personality. If you've heard Paul Westerberg's or Ryan Adams' solo albums, then you've heard this all before done much better.The abundance of rave reviews here only goes to show that some people are WAY too easily impressed."
4,Beck in the day.,"There's a fine line between stupidity and genius. That's what I think when I listen to this album. It's almost indescribable. Lyrically, half of it's absolutely crazy, which is intentional and part of the fun. Musically it's all over the place, somewhere between the ""Beastie Boys"" and ""Neil Young"". But all of these things are what make this so incredible. So many things in a blender still make a tasty treat. This is kind of THE essential ""Beck"" album really. It's kind of the middle ground between ""Midnight Vultures"" and the excellent ""Sea Change"", both of which came years later. I guess it's one of those things you just have to hear to believe."
4,Dylan for druggies,"Beck's Geffen debut, despite the heavy dose of musty sampling, consciously whack emceeing, and overall white-trash persona has aged like a fine wine over the years, whereas some of the material felt shallow when first familiarizing with this acid-folkie's fragmented approach."
5,I'm a loser baby! So why don't you kill me?,"Mellow Gold is a very odd album. It contains very odd music as well as very odd lyrical material. In the hit song, 'Loser' Beck sings, ""In the time of chimpanzees, I was a monkey."" This pretty much gives the gist of the entire album. No song sounds the same yet they are all oddly similar.Though Beck's signature sound comes along with the album, it is vastly different from any of his other material. It contains some very dark songs (Mother....., Truckdrivin' Neighbors Downstairs), some light, happy songs (Pay No Mind, Nitemare Hippy Girl, Sweet Sunshine), and some just plain weird songs (Soul Suckin' Jerk). It's because of the musical diversity on the album that I like it so much.So if you are a fan of Beck's latter material, namely Odelay, be wary in buying this album because though in my opinion it has some of his best material, the general public might think differently."
5,beck's major label debut is the perfect starting point,"this is beck right here. everything he was, is, and will be is on here. when i first heard loser i went out and got this album and my jaw hit the floor. i put this album on and by the time it was over i knew i had found something special. it shows beck doing all kinds of styles of music. and with amazing results. this album when it came out really (IMO) made everything else that was getting mtv airplay at the time look so damn plain. i just couldn't help thinking about why can't others artists do something like this. as the years have passed. i now know why cause most artists can't do something like this and get away with it (heck, most wouldn't even try. lol). an amazing album that while it might not be beck's best album it does show off all of his talents the best. and this alone makes it a classic. you can see right here what the future would hold for beck.this is the best starting point for anybody interested in this guy."
5,The Album With Soul,"This album captures some of Beck's best lyrics tied together with heavy beats. The albums following Mellow Gold also contain great pieces, but due to his success and popularity they seem watered down. Work done prior to this album is unrefined and primative. Without a doubt, some of Beck's untapped talents are captured on Mellow Gold. Some good tracks are Beercan, Motherfuxxer, Pay No Mind, Fuxxin With My Head, and Loser."
4,the best of Beck!!,"This Cd is one of the best albums Beck has made. The lyrics are great and most of the songs are ones you will never get tiered of. My favorite song is ""f-wording with my head"" and nightmare hippy girl is great too. If you love Beck it is a must have."
3,Damn,"Beck is one of those singers who you don't know if they're a genius or if they're a headcase. The sounds in this cd are very random, strange, and dark and somehow Jeff Beck pulls it all together."
1,Amazing,"But not in a good way. This is certainly one of the worst albums I've heard in a long time. The music is bad, the lyrics are awful (and not because they're explicit). The album is just plain bad in every way. Is this some kind of a sick practical joke?"
1,The F-word is just sooo cool...NOT,"Anybody that writes songs with titles like ""Motherf_er"" and ""F_in' with my head"" deserves to be placed in the gutter with gangsta rappers instead of placed on a pedestal alongside Bob Dylan. I don't care HOW good the music is -- and the music is not too bad in this case --- there is just no excuse for profanity for profanity's sake."
5,Exactly what it says,"Mellow Gold is definately mellow, and definately gold. It's one of the greatest CDs I have. The best songs are Loser, Soul Suckin' Jerk, and Beercan."
3,"Not bad, but no classic","""Loser"" is a clever song that had critics crowning Beck as the new Dylan. While that song paints a good picture of Beck's talent, the album Mellow Gold falls short of genius status. The album has its plus side: ""Motherfucker"" grooves and Beck has a devilishly witty sense of humour. But much of the album has a feel of experimentation about it, as if Beck is forming the mold to his more consistent follow-up, Odelay."
4,life is too short to read reviews and i'm writing one,If you like any of beck's pre mutations stuff you will be pleased with this one i guarantee it.
3,Good but Odelay is what I listened to first.,Beck has never done anything in England so everybody over here thinks he is rubbish. On the surface I do admit why the hell do I like this but it is just superb. Mellow Gold is only worth it becuase it is cheaper than buying the single 'loser' which is all the album is worth. Odelay is superb. Beck is CETAINLY THE BEST MUSICIAN - TALENT IS OVER POWERING. I WISH THAT HE WOULD COME OVER TO ENGLAND TO PROVE THAT HE IS NOT CRAP.
1,Man this is a bad cd,"There is a glut of used copies of this cd littering bargain bins around the globe so I figured I'd give it a shot. I was listening to this cd with a friend on the way up to the mountains and we couldn't make it past track 5. Of the 2,000 or so cds I have spun there are three that I couldn't make myself finish. This is one of them.That was 2008. So I waited till now to give it one more chance. I was able to finish it but Dear God the last half of the record is unlistenable. The only song worth anything is the opener novelty cut ""Loser"". With zillions of cds to choose from this is dragging the bottom. The cd made #10 on the 1994 Pazz and Jop poll. Where are the people that awarded this album points now?"
5,Mellow Gold by Beck never seems to get stale,"While the musical styles on this album are diverse they share annoyingly catchy tunes, interesting arrangements and thought-provoking lyrics. Unlike some albums that fade with time, when I return to listen to Mellow Gold it always sounds fresh. On some tracks it feels like a trip to Lowlifesville and you will find yourself humming these tunes unable to explain to anyone why you like them. Beck is one eclectic artist who makes his diverse influences merge in a satisfyingly original sounding manner. Anyone who can write Truckdrivin' Neighbors Downstairs is one twisted individual - I love it."
3,Doomed to be a one hit wonder?,"Well I was proved wrong with that as Beck continues to churn out hit albums. I remember when I first heard ""Loser"" it blew me away as it was the first time I heard sitar in a rap song. ""Pay No Mind"" was also pretty good, it dipped a bit with the Mountain Dew Song, and ""Whiskeycyclone"" is plain weird. My favorite in fact my all time favorite Beck tune is ""Truck Driving Neighbors Downstairs"" it is an awesome song, and I could play it over and over again without getting tired of it. ""Mother F"" is also great. This was probably released a bit too early, and America probably wasn't ready for material like this, but don't let that discourage you from trying this. It's not quite a classic, but it's not bad either."
3,Too big for me,"I bought 2 of these for walking over rough ground because I have weak ankles. I also have skinny ankles so they won't get snug around them. The idea is a good one, you just pull the laces piece around as tight as you need and attach with velcro but you reach the end without getting tight enough on me. So bottom line the product seems to be very good but for me, no. Otherwise I would recommend it."
4,what i wanted,Just what I wanted. It dosn't cover the license plate and it fits in the space provided.Looks great to me.
5,USA Flag License Plate Frame,it is great looking on my truck. I love it The designed reminds me of the United States of America.
3,Hons and Rebels Review,"Well, Jessica Mitford writes in a nice manner.But I thought that of all the Mitford sisters, herlife, or rather, her book, was of lesser interest.I find the lives of Nancy and Unity intriguing.And I gathered that her husband, a cousin, was an opportunist,using her savings, and gambling away their life,in other countries, even the U.S. Also, just gambling.Book was in excellent shape."
2,Why not talk to the people of New Orleans?,"Dyson, of course, is brilliant and he places the Katrina disaster in the context of race relations in the United States, but the book would have been greatly enriched by a few research trips to New Orleans to interview actual eye witnesses to get their perspectives on race and the handling of the aftermath of Katrina."
3,Come Hell or High Water,"I saw the Spike Lee's documentary and of course Dyson was featured offering commentary, which was very good. Thus, I purchased the book, however it left a void as while I am appreciative of his view point the book was penned in a way to be a mixure of non-fiction subject matter and a thesis filled with reference points. In other words what was 240+ pages seemed more academic in communicating the travesty called Katrina. Again, Dyson did a good job of validating his theme but with all of the reference and suggestive footnotes I was hoping for something more substantive than just filling pages with editorial comment or words/phrases used to mask the basic content. Nevertheless, I am glad to have purchased the book as it offers good reference to research or share this topic with others.FredytLos Angeles"
5,Teaching a university class,I developed a course around the HBO show Treme and will be utilizing this book at the collegiate level. It is an excellent view with information that can be fact checked easily. Well thought out and easy to skip around when reading chapters if needed.
1,"This guy belongs on ""IN LIVING COLOR""",This author reminds of a character played on In Living Color where Damon Wayans is a convict that tries to use as many multi-syllabic words as he can so he can SOUND intelligent. This author is not.This book is nothing more than an appeal to left-wing wackos suffering from Bush Derangement Syndrome.
3,its ok,"its ok, but cheesy, feels like it tries too hard to be a alien movie, the effects look outdated but still ok"
2,Book=wonderful pages=awful,The horrible review is definitely NOT for Laura Ingalls Wilder. She is one of my all time favorite authors and anyone who has read this far into her series doesnt need a review to know that. The reason for the lack of stars is the pages of the book. They were done on some sort of slippery BRIGHT white paper... almost like they were plastic or somthing. This made the illustrations beautiful but made it almost impossible to read. Between the mirror like glare and the blinding white I could barely read the wonderful story!!!
5,The years of love,"Laura is teaching school and it has been really hard for her. The only thing she looks forward to is when Almonzo Wilder comes every Friday to take her home to her family. They are courting, and it is a happy time for Laura. Mary also comes home for the first time, and everyone is very happy to see her. This is a time for change in Laura's life."
5,Lovely!,"Laura's life as a young lady is almost as interesting as her life as a little girl. Anyone can identify with the dread of going to a job you hate, although not everyone can identify with doing this in freezing cold blizzards and living in the same house as a madwoman with a butcher knife who hates you. The courtship between Laura and Almanzo is satisfying and sweet, and overall this is a terrific book!"
5,A great book. I Find something new each time I read it.,A wonderful thrilling book! Mrs. Wilder was one of the bests.I really love the way she desribes people by the way their eyes are. You never know what will happen next with Nellie Oleson. Everything is just wonderful in this book. I think everyone should read it. Each time you read it you find something new. I have read it over and over and still love it. She writes so realistic that you feel like you are there witnessing it all. You really feel like one of the family. - Julia
4,Review,These are good quality blades. They arrived on time and this was the best price I was able to find at the time.
5,Anthem rocks like Loudness,"Simple. If you loved the Japanese band Loudness, you'll probably enjoy Anthem. About half of the lyrics are NOT in english (japanese I believe), but the music is so enjoyable you don't even notice! Awesome guitars, awesome riffs."
2,Weak,"My family have played charades for more than 20 years. We love it and were very excited when this game ""CLAIMED"" to have updated titles. All the titles we had were from 1900 - 1960. We couldn't find ANYTHING that was remotely recent. While we still played it but was incredibly frustrating as no one had a point of reference. A real bummer!"
2,Difficult titles and appalling clue gestures,This Charades version was very difficult (not for families) and had very tastless gestures pictured for man and woman. I would not recommend it for anyone and will be reuturning it.
4,Fun game!,The game itself is fun once you get the hang of it. But it is hard to keep score. It should come with a digital timer or something and a buzzer.
5,A favorite,"I finally got tired of carrying this CD from the house to the truck and back, so I bought another copy."
3,Above average,This novel is good summer fun. Don't mistake Havana Heat for The Great Baseball Novel (like The Brothers K). This is an above average feel-good formula story.
4,Aye Yie Yie!,"I would give this book five stars if it weren't for the level of difficulty in reading it...just had to take off a star for that reason alone. This isn't the book for the first time dog owner or casual trainer. It's a serious book for the well-versed student of dog behavior and training. Mr. Lindsay definitely knows what he's talking about but the reader must already have a fairly good grasp of the ""concepts"" behind his explanations in order to fully understand the material. It was a good read that I had trouble putting down, though! If you're serious about learning the more advanced concepts and principles in dog behavior and training, the book is well laid out and informative to the max!"
4,"Confused, but enjoyable anyway","Well, imagine my suprise when I began reading this book only to discover that it had nothing to do with Dog the Bounty Hunter. I had prepared myself to delve deeply into the inner workings of this man by strapping on an extra absorbant Depends adult undergarment and surrounding myself with copius amounts of food to sustain me throughout my intended reading frenzy. I still read the book, and I guess it's great if you want to train actual dogs, but as a guide to help you stalk a trained bounty hunter? Well I had to subtract one star for that shortcoming."
4,A good trip planning resource,"This book is one of a series by Nigel Wheatley (I think that this is the only one co-authored by David Brewer) which covers many of the world's birding hotspots. All make for good reading for the traveling birder, and are especially good during the very earliest phase of trip planning - ie, choosing a destination. Considering the scope of the book, it is understandably brief and shallow, which is its greatest shortcoming. I could envision the next edition doubling in girth, and still omitting a lot! The segment on Mexico is particularly skimpy - whole regions, rich with endemic birds, are left out - such as the Acapulco/Guerrero region. On the other hand, the Lesser Antilles are treated a bit more completely. But, this book (and the series) is really the first of its kind, and every serious or casual neotropical birder will benefit from reading it."
3,Good for what it is,"I think this was a very ambitious project. There are just too many habitats in Mexico, let alone Central America, let alone the Caribbean to cover them thoroughly. However this book manages to give a basic run down of what one will expect in certain places. This is very helpful for some of the lesser known islands in the West Indies which I believe do not have guides."
5,Jack before Jack and great followup to Mac,"If you can follow my title than you want this DVD!!!!! RDA is excellent. The good cop/bad cop cliche works VERY well in this story. RDA plays Jack Rourke, a cop who was arrested years ago under false charges, was cleared but has never been able to shake the fact that he never gets promoted. He can't hold a relationship with anyone. Then he meets a murder witness with a HUGE story behind her also. He spends the vast majority of the film deciding whether he will actually break the law and system that have been unfair to him or keep on the right side. The movie is great and would have to be one of Richard's best works."
2,Another flick from the bargin bin.,"Made-for-TV thriller that is more predictable than thrilling.Lynn is an office-clerk with a mysterious past and a tall stranger following her. The last thing she needs is to have an armed robber tell her the location of 2 million dollars in loot before he commits suicide. The other crooks involved are convinced that Lynn knows where the money is while the police know she was listening to loud music on her headphones and couldn't here a word.As luck would have it an embittered cop is designated to be her protector and after a few rolls in the sheets he finds out Lynn's ability to read lips (incredible co-incidence isn't it?). So plots and betrayals spring up on all sides and you never know who you can trust with two million on the loose.You average TV movie. The most redeeming feature about the DVD is that there are no commercials. But I suppose that there are enough ""Family Ties"" fans out there to keep this one on the shelves for a while"
5,This is the best!,This is one of those albums where every single song is fantastic. The overall cadence of the album is perfect for making dinner! - starts of with great boogie tunes and then moves to more mellow numbers. Wish is I could read Spanish better because what lyrics I can make out are hilarious. It's the best music buy I made last year and it's my two year old's favorite album. Can't say enough about this music except I'm waiting for the next album!
5,fantastic!!!!,"wicked fun, that's what pepe and the bottle blondes are. a latin sound that jumps from the stereo. purchase this cd, you won't be sorry."
4,OLE FOR PEPE & THE BOTTLE BLONDES!!!,"The first time i heard to this cd i think it was just funny, but it grows in you once you listen it again and again. The lyrics, sound effects and rythms are irreverent and funny...although there are many words that are supposed to be in...spanish??? Specially to the last song (#10) i know spanish and didn't understood a word, though the female singer has a very melodic voice... Good for you Pepe & the Bottle Blondes!!!"
5,BUY THIS CD,A great find!!! We dance and sing to the latin beat... laugh at the lyrics...even the dust cover has swing!Buy it... you won't be sorry.
2,Celtic Knot Key,I received three silver keys which I gave away for gifts at Christmas. Very nice and each different. I did not receive the fourth ordered Celtic Knot Key.
2,The book was to drawn out.,"I got some information out of the book but i did not enjoy it because it was extremely boring. some thingd that you would think have no buisness even being part of the book are more elaborated than things such as dress, food, and housing."
1,Purchased a pair only received one lamp shade,Purchased a pair only received one lamp shade. This was very disappointing. I returned the items and did not reorder.
4,kitteh loves bunniez,"cat food made of rabbit is very hard to find these days, but i've been able to get this on a consistent basis. the quality has been very good and the kitteh loves it. And it's definitely helped his GI issues. The only drawback is that it's very expensive, but our kitteh is totally worth it."
3,A Pictorial History of Chevrolet 1955-1957,A interesting and good picture history and some text of the 1955-1957 chevrolet golden years.
5,Learned Alot,"I learned alot from this magic video, and the tricks Mr. Petz taught me left my parents amazed. This is an amazing video to watch and you learn alot"
3,Wasn't the silver bullet I was looking for.,"I've been fighting my dogs skin issues for 5 years now, and I'm always willing to try something new. I'm sure this product is very nutritious and has lots of redeeming qualities, but it didn't seem to help my dogs itching and scratching."
3,Pricey for the lackluster quality,"Bought the closet system and when opening the package saw multiple pieces of the shelving and support pieces that had obviously been dented/nicked in the factory, then finished anyway and put in the box. Considering the money I spent, I had hoped for higher quality control. The hanger rods, while pretty, seem a bit flimsy for any weight. I expect to have to replace them due to warping if I put more than a few shirts/pants on them. Hope I'm wrong . . ."
5,Excellent Quality,"Product is very well made. Looks classy, strong and durable. Would certainly recommend for a high end closet organizer. Directions were fair to follow. Did take about 5 hours to install the way I wanted it. Overall a good quality product."
4,What's good is never easy,"We purchased this product for our new home to maximize the space in our master bedroom closet. By and large it is a quality set-up, sturdy and scalable. My only complaint would be the difficulty of the set-up. It took me eight hours to assemble the entire closet and the instructions at some points were quite vague. Overall though, once completed, this closet organizer was well worth the money."
2,Would not purchase again,The closet system is harder to assemble than described. The instructions are not helpful. If you are not a carpenter I would not buy this.
2,Closet shelving organizer,This closet organizer was nice quality but you wd have to have a lot carpentry skills to put it up It has numerous possible lay outs. The directions are unclear and it comes with a booklet with all kinds of different layouts it can be put up all which didnt have ample directions of what went where It also fails to take into account studs have to be found to support this and in an old house nto so easy to do This was put up in a room not a self contained closet which in the description it definitely didnt say it had to be in a self contained frame work I did have it put up but it definitely didnt come out like the photos
2,work on quality control,"I received this and unfortunately the box was a bit banged up and this resulted in some dents and scratches in the wood. It was too much work to pack it back up to return it, so I'm keeping it. Also a chunk was missing from one of the wood clothes rails, looked like maybe a knot of wood had fallen out. Otherwise the parts look to be sturdy. Make sure your closet is not bigger than 10 feet if you don't want to make adjustments to the system. I do wish Amazon would provide a partial credit, for items that are damaged, but usable and too cumbersome to repack and send back."
4,"looks great, good quality","I am pleased with this closet shelving system after it's all done. The assembly was nothing difficult in concept, but it still took my husband several hours to set it up even though he is pretty handy with tools and all. The shelving did come out sturdy and look great. We installed it in our 6' closet and had spare parts left to finish a smaller closet. Overall, I it's a well-made product of good value."
5,Quality shelving system,"Very nice closet system. Looks great installed. Box says from ""Novice to Expert"" but I would not agree this is a project for a novice. Total install time was close to 7 hours - closer to 9 hours when I include demo of the old closet and painting/ prep prior to install. Without a doubt worth the time for the finished product. **Note** I have put on additions and done many various home improvement projects and would still rate this as relatively difficult."
4,good looking closet system,"I bought this because it was fairly inexpensive and looks good. After all said and done, it was nice, fairly simple to put together, but there were a lot of pieces left over and I'm left feeling like I paid a bit more than I should have. I have a 6' wide closet. It's made for closets that are up to 8' wide. Maybe they should sell them for 4', 6' and 8' systems separately. I now have several long pieces of wood, shelving and tons of hardware that I don't need, so it's a bit of a waste.Ok, that was my big criticism. Otherwise, it looks very elegant, is sturdy (as long as I installed it correctly!) and I would recommend it."
3,"Poor quality material, fairly easy directions","I'm just about done assembling this shelving system and the fact that many of the pieces are warped has affected the installation. The directions aren't too bad but fitting the L brackets on the vertical support beams is a pain, made worse due to the aforementioned warped material. So far though this system seems fairly sturdy so I guess I'll edit this review in a year and report back on how it's held up. I don't think I'd buy another one of these systems however."
2,"OK system, but . . .","I much prefer the deluxe system for the money. This one should be significantly cheaper for what you get. No round metal rods for hanging clothes. Only rectangular wood pieces that do not attach all that firmly.I would NOT buy this one again. I am not going to replace it anytime soon, but I wish I could."
4,Great looking closet I have...,"This is a great product at a great price. I purchased this at $169. It took me an afternoon to install and it looks great. The key is to spend time understanding the drawings in the instruction and know your options. I made the top and lower shelves higher to fit my shirts because I didn't want my shirts touching the floor. The best way is to measure what you need with your shirt/jacket on a hanger. The hanging bar is 2"" to 3"" below the shelf."
5,excellent,"i'll keep this short and sweet.. this is a great closet system for the money. I just installed my second one last weekend and for the money, you can't go wrong. The instructions can be a little confusing so having a hint of aptitude for this sort of thing will definitely help. Plan it out and take your time assembling. Construction is solid, it looks great and they give you enough parts to customize to your space."
5,Custom Closet-Great use of space,"Had a carpenter install it as we purchased 2 of them for a new closet-great use of space, very sturdy, great looking!"
5,good organizer,"takes some time to set up the first unit, but after that you can change the configuration to your liking as far as height and width. A good product."
4,Quite a good book I occasionally pull down and read again,"Good guy with just a Master's degree in astronomy gets laid off from his job since he doesn't have the Ph.D. union card. He does job search and gets hired for interesting research and development job that requires his abilities as engineer, astronomer, and pilot. I still like to re-read it occasionally."
4,Sandhill cranes are beautiful!,"The film overall is good. The footage of the cranes throughout the film is excellent. Crane lovers will enjoy it very much for the beautiful footage.One flaw in the film, though, is the repetitive scenes. The other flaw is the lack of detail for the overall natural history of the cranes presented ==> such as where the cranes migrate to in the winter; final destination(s)of summer migration; length of time to migrate; life span; mating rituals..."
3,Trade a Little Convenience for Power,"Laguna is a brand in pumps I have worked with for quite some years now. The new ""cage"" style pumps are indeed nice in regard to handling solid waste appropriately in your pond meaning the pumps do well at not getting clogged up by debris. These pumps are also powerful and use less electricity to move water than most other push pumps do. However, finding the appropriate fittings (such as quick connects) is an inconvenience because one: they are hard to find, and two: it is very difficult to know what ""size"" you really need for hose size adaptation, etc. once you do locate them. Also, in many applications I have found getting hosing onto the fittings to be a real bear as a lot of heat or Vasoline is needed to complete this tight task! Nevertheless, it's your choice. If you want to try Laguna brand pumps, order them easily and much cheaper through AMAZON.COM. Nowadays you won't find these products at any retail operation."
2,A so-so album with unacceptable copy-protection,"I love this guy! I've seen him many times in concert and have most of his albums. But this one is a bit of a snooze. With the exception of Black Betty and a ""def-stupid"" remake of ""I Who Have Nothing"", there is not much to recommend on this album. A pitty.What makes it even worse is that the CD is created with ""copy control technology"". This means that you cannot rip the CD and load it on your MP3 player. I didn't see any mention of this feature on Amazon when I went to purchase the CD. I paid good money for a real, full-featured CD... what I got was a pseudo-CD. They should not charge full price for a CD like this.Tom... make them stop!"
5,Perfect relacement.,"Perfect replacement item for any cranks that required a 48t x 19mm spindle. I used this a replacement for Odyssey 41 Thermal cranks, and have been very pleased with the results."
2,recording not very good,"the recording could have been a lot better.the music selection was not bad, but with the great difference in volumeyou have to constantly play with the volume."
5,Fantastic,"This is one of the best Red Army Choir cd's around. The variety of songs is excellent and epic. The sound recording on this disc is better than any of the other ten albums of theirs that I have. For the love of Bog in his high heaven, buy it."
4,Did you grow up with Russian grandparents?,"Did they play Chaliapin for you? Recordings of the Red Army Chorus? Did you know ""Song of the Volga Boatmen"" before you knew ""My Darling Clementine""? Then this CD is for you! Makes anyone misty-eyed for Mother Russia, the black bread and vodka."
2,Sound quality,"The songs that are chosen on this CD are excellent. The problem, the sound recording is not great. It is clear, but when the choir sings in a low tone, it is simply cannot be heard."
3,Eh!,"For a work by a vaunted Harvard Law School Professor, I would have thought it would havemore 'gravitas'. It's rather light on depth and thought."
5,Neo-Romantic Music for Viola,"What a great combination for a CD! The neo-romantic Bartók and Bloch both wrote lovely pieces for solo viola with orchestral accompaniment. While Bloch's piece is not technically a concerto, it shares equal emotional and virtuosic power with the Bartók.Thompson is an able violist, making the instrument sound like a violin when he reaches higher. The Slovenian Radio Symphony may be lesser known, but here they prove themselves able to tackle music that is often more difficult to express than the listener may realize. Both the concerto and the suite are warm (rather than the typical melancholy sound of the viola) and the technical aspects of the recording are brilliant.How wonderful it is to get a recording where you are immediately satisfied with everything it has to offer."
5,Scintillating Book,"I read this book when it was first published, and I remember the vividly even today. I especially liked the relationship between the British woman and Rohan, a theme that has been explored previously by many authors and filmmakers, but not with *this* particular twist (the erotic love scenes).My favorite book by Ms. Roy is The Captivation, a book that is now out of print. I have a feeling that as time goes on, more and more books by Ms. Roy will be equally valued.Bravo, Ms. Roy! I can't wait to read (and buy) your next book!"
5,A wonderful look at a steamy colonial life,I usually don't write reviews because I'm not much of a writer but I had to add my words of praise about this book. It truly is so much more then just an erotic novel. Nina described the colonial British in India with such detail that I was transported to that time and place. She describes the art and scenery with such detail that you can feel the hot India sun and dust covering you as you read through the story. You discover the magic and beauty of India as Devora discovers it. I think I loved the world that Devora discovered more then she did! Devora and Rohan are beautifully written characters with incredible passion. Rohan was incredibly passionate and wise. He is the perfect lover for Devora. I loved this book so much I've written the author to ask for a sequel.
3,Vanilla chai.,"The story of a young British wife and the Indian head servant was sweet. Cultural information was not strong.... The characters were fairly strong, even the slighted husband. The author didn't try to give him any serious character flaws, she just made him a typical British gentleman of the time period. All in all, I would like to have seen more of India, and Indian culture."
5,Excellence in historical erotica,"This book was totally captivating..the author takes us to British ruled India and comments on the erotic art of the country and the social restrictions which existed at the time. These blend well with the eroticism of the characters, especially the English woman, Devora, and her Indian lover, Rohan. There were characters you liked and had empathy for, as well as those you found aggravating. This was truly a fascinating book, and I would encourage reading it by giving it a 5 star rating."
2,An OST Which Completely Lacks Originality,"I saw the Movie, and I loved the original composition which was present in many of the emotional scenes. Throughout the film, they'd use small snippets of popular songs, which were appropriate for the movie (Ace of Spaces, etc).This OST took advantage of those snippets, and crammed these age-old tunes onto a CD and marketed them. Why in God's name would you pay $30+ dollars for an Audio CD with a random assortment of old music?The original Orchestra composition present (Clint Mansell) in the film is almost entirely absent from this disk, comprising only TWO of the tracks on set-list.The end scene had an especially moving and invigorating orchestra piece, which was not included in this soundtrack. It can be found at Clint Mansell's Myspace, entitled Dead Reckoning.I am sorely disappointed in this OST, as it is hardly ""Original"" at all."
1,"Not the ""score"" album","The item I received was NOT the score album. I received the original soundtrack, which is obviously easier to find than the score album. I have now attempted to purchase the score album for my husband three times--this time I thought I finally had it, and then Amazon sends me the wrong album...three days before Christmas. Thanks Amazon."
5,Feel Good Music,"Since I received this CD, I have played it numerous times. I never tire of listening to it."
4,PPA-first,I found the book rich of useful explanations and methods for both the understanding of impact phenomena and the practical engineering applications. Many cases are thoroughly developed and prompt to be used in real situations.
2,Satisfactory,"I bought the package with the lcd screen protectors, rubberized case, car charger. The car charger stopped working after a month (maybe 10 uses). All the other items are withstanding soo far. I was pleased with the deal i got excpet for the car charger situation.."
1,Completely disposable...,"Bought this trying to save money, since I wouldn't use it all that much in my car (I'd usually charge my LG VX8600 overnight at home). But just in case, I thought I would purchase a car charger inexpensively instead of getting the ""official"" LG charger for $30(!). After using it I think twice, the third time I plugged it in, one of the metal touch plates slipped out of it's slot, bent completely backwards without my knowing it, and made the charger completely useless. There is no way to bend it back into shape, with one end going into a slot toward the charger plug in. I tried to fix it but became frustrated, and eventually broke the thing in half trying to reconnect the metal ""prongs"". Just threw it away and purchased one for around $7, I believe, at the local Wal-Mart and it's working fine. At least I can exchange it if I need to, locally, without a shipping hassle, and it supposedly has a three year warranty (although I doubt it will last that long)."
4,Very informative resource,"I have a friend who is very much into the ""science"" of vitamin, mineral and herb supplements and who has been trying to get me to take some form of supplement. I came across this book and was impressed at the amount of information contained in it. Chapters devoted to various vitamins, what they do, and what foods they can be found in. Also there is information about various minerals and herbs, as well as a part of the book devoted to various common illnesses and disorders that can be helped with the use of vitamins, minerals, and herbs.Of course, this book is not the same as talking with your doctor about any health issue you may have and should be not be used in that manner. However, this book does give lots of tips and ideas about ways to improve your health through the use of supplements."
4,Pretty much what I was looking for,At first the carrier seemed like it was a little light for what I was looking for. But after using it for over a month now I think it's going to be OK. I've had over 15 Lbs of tools in it going up and down steps with no problems. I do like the zippered compartments - I don't worry about the smaller tools dropping out. The center compartment is big enough to carry a full sized hacksaw with room for other larger tools. I've even had several full sized AB PLC5 I/O cards in it.The only complaint I can come up with is the smaller compartments are a little loose for smaller screwdrivers. Also if you work in different sites and environments - (I do industrial electrical work and PLC automation in different industries) you might run into problems keeping it clean because of the material.Overall - A very good tool carrier for the money.
5,"HUGE BAG! GOOD, BUT HUGE!!!","This bag is well built, looks good, more storage and pockets than any bag I've ever owned (and I've owned alot). I have everything in this bag, screwdrivers, a big assortment of pliers, wrenches, channel locks, 130pc. bit set, socket set, 2 drills, multimeter, hammer and the list goes on. Only complaint is there is no tape loop to hold your tape like most bags have (does have clip for measuring tape) but it has a small carabiner that is ok for 1 roll of electrical tape but can't hardly fit plumbers tape on it. Oh yeah did i mention !THIS BAG IS HUGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,This bag is the balls.,"I'm an apprentice plumber and I use a CLC 14"" open top tool bag for all my standard plumbing tools. I bought this to store all the other random tools I didn't want weighing down my other bag. The middle pocket is pretty huge, I keep an 18v Dewalt sawzall, drill, light, charger, drill bit set, small socket set, 18"" & 24"" pipe wrenches, utility chisel, 3 lb. sledge, and who knows what else in it. The two sides have a ton of pockets, I think I have about %50 full. It usually sits in my truck so I can't tell you how well it holds up under heavy use but I've had my other CLC bag for almost 3 years and it's still kicking, and I think this bag is better quality."
5,excellent tool bag.,"i just replace my old tool bag due to space reason. now with the leathercraft 1539, i have all the space i need and all my tools are very organize and very accessible. i love it."
5,Large Tool Bag - NICE !,"Ussaully I will have to look at something like this in hande before purchasing to check Quality - Size - and Workablitiy. I needed a tool bag to hold my Recip. Saw (Dewalt) and Drill plus all of my hande tools for electrical work. I seen this on amazon and ordered it since the pictures looked nice and had dimentions. When I got it I was very supprised on how nice this tool bag really is and at a great price too. If you have a lot of hand tools and cordless power tools, this bag will work nicely in most cases. For me, this was a great tool bag and at a great price too. I was going to get a ""Klein Tool Bag"" I've seen at Lowes or Home Depot, but this bag is much better and the quiality is very good too."
1,"Terrible book for undergraduates, impossible to use for a class","This book might be educational or enlightening if you had a year (or long leisurely summer) and nothing to do but read the book and take your time going through page by page at your own pace. The reality, however, is that college professors will assign this book to unsuspecting undergraduates, and then jump around from chapter to chapter following a syllabus.This doesn't work, because this book:-- Is arbitrarily self-referential-- Has NO WORKED EXAMPLES-- Has terribly drawn and worthless diagrams and illustrationsOverall this is one of the worst textbooks I've ever had to work with, and my physics study groups all agree.TERRIBLE BOOK. Do not assign. Do not buy."
3,THE BOOK OF ONLY PROBLEMS.,"i just don't understand the name of this book.guided tour means i guide someone to do some thing or to know itbut this book is just the opposite it does not guide u to do anything except of problems without answers..good luck.the introduction preceding every problem is very short and always misty and definitly not enough to solve most of the problems there , which makes the book very unsuitable for selflearning like in my case..because if you stuck ...-> no help.2 b ohnest here i purchased 2 books with the name mathematicalmethodes and both are just useless from educational point of view..but this book could have been marvelous if it were written likenormal books because it is full of very nice math. but the approach of the book is really bad.because there is no much of explanations,no examples ,no techniks how to solve problems ...just u and the problems alonevois la."
1,Take your laptop with you,"This is a very useful book. BUY THE PRINT EDITION. The digital version does not allow you to print out the hikes you may want to take - making the digital version completely useless unless you intend on taking your laptop along on the hike. While I can understand that the authors don't want you to print out the book and sell it, by not allowing printing of the hikes you'd like to take you must either memorize the details or buy another book so you don't go off track (or trail as the case may be). Buy the book, preferrably at the park. Yes I know the trails are well marked and all you really need is the information for the trail head, but it would have been really nice to take the 2 or 3 pages of the information along (without the whole book) - which would have made this book really useful instead of a novelty for ebook geeks. I don't like reading books on the computer anyway."
4,Thouroughly enjoyed this cd!,"I am not a big R&B fan, nor am I an oldies fan. One of the Persuaders' group members is under my mother's care at a nursing home and tells endless stories about his days in this group. I decided to buy the cd and give it a whirl. I really liked the soulfulness of the title track and ""If This Is What You Want."" It's nice to remember when songs were simple and carefree like those on this album. I play it when I am in a mood to lay back and relax or doo-wop in my car. I also enjoyed the song ""Mr. Sunshine."" I wish there were more albums available. This was a great introduction to oldies R&B."
3,Outstanding rendition of what really happens in a troop.,"This is a nice little book written by a gentleman who has ""been there and done that."" It's worthwhile reading for the new Scoutmaster."
5,Parenthood: Season1,Started watching Parent Hood last year in season 3. Nice to see how this great TV show got started! I am almost done with Season 1. I love all the actors. Great story.
5,BEST SHOW IN YEARS!,"AMAZING. Parenthood is one of the best shows currently on air. The storylines are realistic and tug at your emotions. I can laugh and cry in the same episode due to the fantastic writing and phenomenal acting by each of the cast members, especially Lauren Graham, Mae Whitman, and Peter Krause. In a world filled with dumb reality shows, Parenthood is a breath of fresh air. Everyone I've talked to about this show can relate to this show in some way and I find that incredible. You will not regret this purchase! (And don't forget to watch Parenthood every Tuesday night at 10 pm EST!)"
4,empathy in the spirit of FNL,"Human empathy in the spirit of that achieved by Friday Night Lights is evidenced in Parenthood. You can tell the creative process is at work as the storytelling allows the characters to find themselves, which I appreciate, although others may not. Stellar cast, especially Peter Krause, one of the best actors in all of television. However, since I like it I'm sure it will go the way of other shows that I enjoy that many will not as TV is only an escape from reality rather than existing as a mirror for us to reflect on our own perceptions of what is real. Thank you team Braverman."
3,Interesting,Wish there were more scenes wiith the Bedelia and Nelson. Like the show but there are so many characters to. Keep track of.
5,Love it,Another netflix show that got me to buying the seasons! I didn't think I would like it but I love it! I can't wait til the 4th season and Netflix gets that!
5,Parenthood,This show hits close to home being a parent and 30 something. Love to watch since I can relate and sympathize with the characters.
5,Great show,"I normally don't care for TV series like Parenthood but this show is great. The casting is awesome, and the simplicity of the plot of everyday issues is what makes it so good. Highly recommend this show to anyone."
5,An amazing series!!!!,"I bought this series for my wife after she started enjoying the current season. Not normally a television series watcher, I sat down and with her and was amazed at the real life situations and the different aspects of parenting portrayed. A great series."
5,At last! A new favorite show.,"I didn't think I would ever admire a TV show again when ""NYPD Blue"" ended. ""Parenthood"" has the same quality acting, directing, and production values. It surpasses anything else currently being offered on any network or cable. Absolutely love this show - it's real, down to earth, honest. I hope it's on for a long time."
5,a well-written show,"This is a very well-written show about a family with realistic challenges. I look forward to every episode, and hope there are many more seasons to come."
5,"Wonderful show, relatable characters",This show makes me wish I had a large family! It's a great story about people who have experiences and emotions that almost anyone can relate to. The actors are wonderful and the storylines always entertain.
5,Great series,Saw this as a deal on cyber monday and scooped up 2 for gifts. This is a great series and highly recommend. Great cast in this show.
5,Great Christmas Gift,I bought this series for my son last christmas. It was a great deal and my son really enjoyed every episode of this program.
5,Love this backpack!,This backpack is much taller than it looks in pictures. There are lots of pockets and storage areas. The padding is great in the laptop pocket.
2,"Constructed well, small in size.","says its a large bag well its not compared to targus drifter II or targus city gear. its has very few pockets and those are small as well.if you have lots of pc equipment like hdd power cords for them your gonna end up dumping it all into one section of the bag, not really organized if you ask me.but on the pro side it is well constructed and looks durable.if you just need it for laptop and a mouse and its own power cord. and some folders/files/mags, ect.....but for a traveler with lots of pc stuff i dont recommend it."
5,"""Guayacan scores a BIG YES""","Orquesta Guayacan ""De nuevo en la Salsa"" Scores a BIG YES!The guys from Colombia have again given their fans what they deserve, a gem!This well produced CD is just as good if not better then their Greatest Hits CD. That's right, your reading correctly.If one takes into account the many years it took to create the Greatest Hits album, than you can see the successful magnitude of this spicy Salsa CD.For those who are unfamiliar with this terrific orchestra, this would be a good choice to introduce yourself.For the Guayacan fan you'll surely want this CD. It's really good.A special note to the producers of this wonderfully entertaining group. Please stick to Latin and lay off the English lyrics. I'm making reference to ""My shinning star"".Keep up the great work! With admiration I anxiously await the next CD release."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"EXPECTED THIS BOOK TO BE HARDBACK AS INDICATED IN PRODUCT INFORMATION,BUT ACTUAL ITEM DELIVERED WAS IN PAPERBACK !!!!!I WOULD NOT HAVE PLACED THIS ORDER KNOWING IT WAS PAPERBACK !!!"
1,Horrible,"Well what do you expect when you get an ex, pro football player hopped up on steroids, who cant act to star in a movie. Lyle Alzado(RIP) stars as a demented convict who is left locked up in MSP after the prison has closed down. When a low budjet film crew decides to shoot a ""convict women"" type movie, Lyle breaks out and all hell breaks loose. The only positive part of this movie is that Lyle has almost no lines, so you only have to deal with a dissfunctional plot. I dunno, it may become a cult classic. Its a real stinker though. It tries to be a horror movie but fails misserably when all you do is laugh at the bad production. It has some full frontal nudity, for some the only redeeming quality."
2,Disappointed.....,"Have loved their sandals for years so was really excited when they came out with something for the winter. Be careful when you order these, ours stretched almost a whole shoe size, can't even keep them on my feet anymore. They don't stand behind this product the way that they do their sandals. Very disappointing, we will go back to our Uggs."
1,Dull reading for nothing,"The book gives an impressive number of names and titles of the actors in the XVIIIth century, but without any reference. Not a single quote is referenced an the reading is really dry, dull, simply enumerating political, economic and bibliographical facts.At the end of the book, the author presents some adversaries of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. He simply calls Joseph de Maistre ""mentally ill"" (p.264), and don't take any of these persons serious. By reading this book, you will pass some hard time for reading a book that doesn't help you to understand the Enlightenment, nor the context.Don't spill your money for this book. This work of Hampson hasn't any scientific value. I recommend all the works of Isaiah Berlin instead."
3,Blodwyn Pig Live,"I discovered Mick Abrahm's as the 1st guitarist with Jethro Tull while in high school. As a New York metro disc jockey in 1974, I wore Bloodwyn Pig records to a sheet of glass.Having moved out of Jethro Tull as a blues/jazz fusion guitarist, Mick formed Bloodwyn Pig as a blues / jazz quartet featuring Jack Lancaster on saxaphones (played two saxes at a time). The music of Bloodwyn Pig at New York's old Fillmore East is legendary. Live at the Lafayette purely shines out with this rollicking boogie blues band of the Savoy Brown/Fleetwood Mac british blues period.Though Mick Abrahms released a sparkling import solo lp awhile back, I suggest this CD to any live british blues enthuisiast looking for raw energy in sound. You won't regret this one baby!"
4,"Brilliant writing, cheap print","William Ruddiman has easily produced one of the best textbooks I have ever read. I have never had much patience reading materials and methods chapters in papers and books. The way he incorporates the methods into the text, starting with a question, then explaining the way how to get to the answer, then finally getting to the results, makes it an exciting reading experience - almost like a mystery story.The one point off is for the quality of the paper and the print. For this price, they should have done better."
5,Berkshire Softest Microloft King blanket pink,"This is a beautiful, so soft blanket that I look forward to utilizing in the cool to cold months ahead. It is of superb quality! The price of this blanket makes it a most affordable purchase. Highly recommended seller!"
3,Not What I Had Hoped,"I missed the Pinzon Microplush blanket back when it was a Lightning Deal. The craze surrounding it prompted me to look into purchasing a similar blanket. I found these here on Amazon, and happily purchased one.However, I was to be disappointed. The item does not feel like Microplush, more like Microfleece. It is a good blanket, but not what I was looking for.I did keep it, as it works well between my new Microplush and my comforter. I will never turn down an added layer of warmth, and it is decent for the price.So, if you are looking for a Microplush blanket, do not buy this. If you are looking for a cozy blanket to add to your collection, it is certainly worth the $20."
2,Soft but SHEDS,This blanket is nice and soft and I liked it at first. That was until I discovered how much it sheds. I tried washing it a couple of times just to get the extra threads out but it didn't work. It still sheds like crazy! To Goodwill it goes!
5,So soft and comfy!,"This is the most perfect between seasons blanket. Light enough for those cool California summer nights when you need more than just a sheet. The material is very soft, pile and fuzz free. I highly recommend this product."
5,Blanket,This was a gift for my sister in law. She said it was very soft and was very impressed with my selection. perfect gift
5,Nice soft blanket,"I use this on my massage table, it's so soft to the touch, and holds up well wash after wash! My clients are always complimenting on it!"
2,Not an electric Blanket,"When I did a search on Amazon, for ""electric blanket"", this was 11th item of matches. I like the color and price. When it arrived I was disappointed to find that it was just a blanket. Nothing electric about it. It will be returned, with some frustration at Amazon."
3,Why does this come up on a search for electric blankets???,"This blanket is lovely and soft, but well, no wonder it was the least expensive option on my search for ""twin electric blanket."" The keywords need to be changed on it immediately. Of course, that's what I get for not paying enough attention."
2,Blanket,"This blanket was listed as possible items to purchase when I typed in ""Electric Blanket"" however it is NOT electric so don't be fooled by the selections that come up. Check them out thoroughly before you purchase. I had to send it back and order another that I made sure said ""Electric"" in the blanket description."
5,Great blanket,"Wanted something to help with the chilly Wisconsin winters. And I wanted something large enough for my 6'2"" frame. This is plenty big enough for me and even my 5 year old next to me.Soft and warm. It's not heavy, so if you're looking for that heavy, pressing, comforting feeling of being hugged this isn't the blanket for you, although if you double it up it does lend a larger sense of existence.Very warm though, whether or not you double it up. For popping the feet up on the couch and relaxing watching TV or reading my Kindle, this is great."
5,perfect lightweight blanket,"I purchased one of these blankets a week or so ago, and I've just ordered another in linen. The periwinkle of the first is not the shade of blue that I was hoping for; however, it is wonderfully soft and washes well, and I was delighted to discover that my bed stays in a much tidier pile when it is sandwiched in between uber-slippery Vellux blankets (don't waste your money on those, by the way, the quality of the one I bought here last summer is terrible compared to older Vellux blankets that I own...buy a Berkshire or two instead if you are like me and can't tolerate a lot of weight on you while sleeping)."
1,Not impressed by this item,"For the price I paid, this is nothing special at all.I have other gags that were much less $$$ that are much Better then this.Just Another $2 dollar toy sold by amazon for $20."
4,alright,"sturdy, durable, and works well. strap is thin, 1/2 inch at the most. all in all a decent product."
4,Works as Intended,I have a small jaw so this fit perfectly in my mouth without causing any dsicomfort. The only thing that could have made it better is if it were a little larger at the base. Overall my bf and I really enjoy it!
5,An LCD for a Plasma Price,"I had done a fair amount of research before buying this set. I decided upon an LCD because of the picture quality and that it also generated less heat than a plasma.I am very pleased with the quality of the images on the screen, and very surprised at the decent sound of the speakers that came with it. We have some HD channels and they look great. Actually regular TV looks good too.My main goal was to have this TV for DVDs. I have hooked up a spare DVD player, that I had only spent less than $50 on, to it just to see how things look. Wow! Also I have not used the HDMI connection, which I understand makes things even better. In fact, I am running the thin, inexpensive RCA cables that came with the DVD, and the cables supplied by my cable company for tv, and everything looks great.I'll do everything right before I hang it on the wall. I would expect things to look even better then."
5,purchsed for a gift,I purchased this for my father and he is very happy wih it I think he has used it a few times and it fits the saw he needed it for
5,Brilliant Aussie Country,"This entire compilation disc is amazing, particularly if you're also a fan of Bill and Kasey Chambers. Highlights are ""Half Way to Sydney"" and a heartbreaking cover of Slim Dusty's ""Saddle Boy."" This cd is a gem! BUY IT!!"
4,Great buy for the $,"I use these bags to carry way to much stuff on my commute to work and school and they work great. I ride to the light rail which has ceiling hooks to hang your bike by the front tire, which means I have to take the bags off when I'm on the train. This also means that sometimes I have about one minute to remove my bags and get on the train. They are easy to take on and off quickly and are still very secure on the bike.I will look into adding some sort of fastener to the top of the bag though to help keep it tucked in close to the bike when I have a lot of weight in it. Sometimes when I have a heavy load (and by heavy load I mean approximately 25-30 lbs)the bag tends to sag open. I am not at risk of loosing anything, I would just prefer to reduce my overall width.All in all, great buy and would highly recommend."
3,You can take it with you,"Attached with no problem to my rack. The metal top hooks are coated to the are less like to scratch the rack. The lower hook is on an elastic cord to keep the bags from swing away from the rack. The bags are somewhat stiff with the side inserts in place, but the weight limit is pretty low since the outside top of the bag baloons out a fair amount with any load in it (needs a strap from the rack side to prevent this) and the bottom sags down some as well. They are still useful but sure don't look very elegant when deployed with a load.These were my first foray into shopping bags for my bike and the price is what attracted me. I think I probably got what I paid for, which means I would not buy these again but instead do some more research and not be afraid to spend more to get something that is better engineered and a lot sturdier."
2,Bag spreads open when carrying anything,"I might be using it incorrectly but there are two things I don't like:1. It is too wide and so my foot hits it on the upstroke.2. The top flares open when carrying anything. I wish it had a strap to hold it together while riding. If I'm missing something, please respond to this post and I'll update my recommendation."
1,possibly the poorest design EVER,"If you hunting for a good, serviceable pannier, keep on looking. This bag sucks! Here are the problems. The bag gaps open allowing things to fall out. Most bags of this type have some method for tightening the sides of the bag to keep things inside. This one doesn't. There is a clasp attached at the bottom of the bag that will keep it shut completely. That's fine if you have nothing inside. But, the clasp is absolutely useless once you have anything in the bag. The last straw broke for me today when the hook that attaches the bag to the bike rack fell off.Really, do that have low IQ monkeys designing for this company? No, monkeys would probably realize that if they had to carry bananas in this bag that they would lose them. I would give it zero stars, if the rating existed."
1,Does not fit on my Hitatchi C10FC miter saw,"I purchased the Hitatchi C10FC miter saw that did not come with extensions so I ordered these. The holes on the saw do not match the width of these extensions. The holes on the saw are much wider so I am not sure if this was a recent change to this model of saw or these extensions changed. I am still looking for the proper extensions for this saw. As the other reviews said, the extensions SHOULD have been included with this saw."
4,Great wings,These table extension wings are exactly what was needed in the workshop that I purchased them for. Now two man jobs have become one. The wings for the Hitachi miter saw were easy to install and just complements the saw. Its a great addition.
3,Meh,"I can see how this book may have been shocking to Victorian sensibilities and to the prudish now, but I felt the importance of this work in the world of erotica is exaggerated. The emotional experience of submission is well explored in this book, and, from the author's name comes 'masochism', but I feel like it all could have been opened even more. Maybe I feel less than satisfied with this book due to the standards of modern morality and entertainment. This book is tame compared to what you can see on cable television, without even paying for the premium channels. The main character's experience with submission is compelling, but at times, you wish the author had been more explicit about the nature of the character's suffering. More particular about the emotional and physical suffering caused by the Venus in Furs. It seems that being more precise would have driven home the ideas on submission, domination and whether they can destroy love much more strongly."
4,A classic,"Considering the story was written years ago, it addresses a contemporary subject. After reading it, it gives you many things to ponder."
3,"Becomes boring, monotonous, ultimately bourgeois fantasy","When i first started reading this book, i was thrilled to find one so literary, beautiful, and exciting. The characters were entertaining, intelligent, and the story was beautifully described, especially the scenes with the statue and the garden.Yet, after 40 pages, the masochism and sadism became frankly boring, and repetative. As Wanda invented new ways to torture Severin, she really wasn't inventing anything new, just more of the same old.Ironically, what at first seems like a progressive, amoral book, reveals itself as really a naughty fantasy of a very conservative mind, and all Wanda and Severin want to do is get married. Can anything be more boring than that? This is true perversion, and not really thinking outside of the box."
4,"Thank you Madam, may I have another?","This is an extraordinary work of sexual deviation. It goes without say that Sacher-Masoch supplied the M in S & M. This novel which mirrors a relationship in Sacher-Masochs real life is a disarmingly sensual tale. While I have no desire to be tied up and whipped, I found myself deeply engrossed in Severins plight into abuse and humiliation. This philosophy of the hammer or the anvil is interesting to me. Obviously, Severin prefers to be the anvil to Wandas hammer. This confuses me as I believe in human dignity but to each his own. I can not agree with the hammer or anvil theory but I suppose that it is a formula that works for many people. It apparently was quite thrilling to Sacher-Masoch. This is an amazingly frank work. It is sensual and poignant simultaneously. Reccommended."
1,Could of done more...,"The Ecology of War makes the arguement that military activities disproportionately afeect the environment. Quoted is a figure that the US DOD produces 5 times more toxic materails than the top 5 US chemical companies.Though this begins to peak interest, the author fails to analyze military activities into types of environmental impacts, the risks associated with these impacts, nor any form of comparison with non-military activities. Some examples appear to be out-side of the scope of the book.The Ecology of War reads more like a scrap book than a study with a purpose. The author contends that military activities are harmful to the environment, but does not go far beyond stating the obvious, or offer solutions.The one thing that may interest a reader is the authors time-line of scortched earth efforts, which is rather well compiled."
1,there is nothing deluxe about this shaver,"I saw this at the drugstore for only $10 and thought I would give it a try. When I opened the the bulky plastic carrying case which is included with the item, the glass mirror which is attached to it fell off. Luckily it did not break. A cheap glue had been used to secure it. It included a personal groomer for ear and nose hair with an additional attachment for shaving other body hairs. But the personal groomer is so cheaply made that it cuts off if you move it quickly, and it barely cuts. The shaver itself is advertised as a ""pleasure of a gentle shave that leaves your skin amazingly smooth and soft to touch"". But you can run this thing all over your face all day and you will still have a five o'clock shadow. After using it a couple of times (why I tried it a second time I do not know), it is very apparent that this is, as another reviewer put it, a ""hunk of junk"". Paying ten cents for this item would be too much."
1,Hunk of Junk,Do not buy this razor. I recently bought it at a local Goody's. The razor itself work for maybe 3 times (not very good)then just broke. The ear and nose trimmer didn't work at all. Very poorly made product
3,Nice TV when I have it,"I bought the tv on 9/9/06. The picture and sound are great, however the image started blinking. Philips is covering the repair at an authorized repair center. They have had the TV for over one month now. Philips will not extend my warranty even though I have gone more than a month with out the tv. Philips repair company give you no preference. So if you buy one hope it does not blow because it takes a large amount of time to fix. Buyer beware. 10/14/06 still no set."
2,I Realize How Disappointed I am with Hanes t-shirts,"These t shirts are a real let down. For so long I have been a Hanes fan, until now. The shirts do not feel comfortable after washing, the fit is binding. The sleeves and bottom curl up, and to make matters worse, they sewed a white tag on the bottom, so when it curls up, the tag is exposed. I have ordered several Russell Atheletic t shirts that have a higher custormer rating. They should arrive soon."
2,smallest 3X in history,I ordered a 3X t-shirt that turned out to be the size of a large! The price was great. It wasn't worth mailing back so will give it to a smaller person for a present.
3,Not 100% cotton!,"I just got an exact one of this T-shirt (graphite) today, and found that it's not 100% cotton! The printed tag (actually no tag, just directly printed on the area where a tag usually was) read 50% Cotton and 50% polyester."
5,Excellent Buy!,The T-shirt is so comfortable I brought 7 of them in different colors. Russel Ahtletic is the brand you can trust completely.
5,Muy buena camiseta,"Muy cómoda, a muy buen precio, no muy delgada, fácil de lavar y de buena calidad para un uso casual, lo indicado para un uso casual y a un muy buen precio, lo recomiendo"
3,The fit is ok,"The product shipped on time but I'm not quite satisfied with the fit, it's a bit loose on the arms"
4,Nice gym shirt,"The sizing is a bit on the larger side.At 5'7"" with a stocky build, the medium is pretty much perfect for the gym- loose & comfortable without being too baggy."
2,Not so great,"Sure its your average shirt, maybe I got unlucky. I washed mine once and the thread started to unravel on the bottom seam."
2,Russell Tee shirts,"I have worn Russell Tee shirts for years and found them to be well made from a fairly heavy material and they always lasted years. The ""Russell"" Tee shirts I recently purchased via Amazon, were cheaply made of a thin material that looks horrible after 1 or 2 washings. The shirts have the Russell name on them but they are like a cheap imitation."
3,Russel T,"Got Russell T based on Amazon reviews. Wanted an undershirt or basic color T to wear around town. Shirt holds a lot of lint when washed,and has an R logo on one sleeve which I did not care for. But for the price, I didn't expect much. It doesn't shrink too much and holds shape pretty well, it will be a good work shirt or undershirt, but it won't be used as a basic T."
5,Great workout t-shirt,A basic shirt which is pretty durable...for the price if it lasts 3 months of workouts then well worth it!
1,DO NOT LIKE IT,The material is really bad and it doesn't fit good. The sleeve are too big and it is short and is really no good. Don't buy it! WASTED MONEY
3,Messed up my order.,Paid for two of these shirts.. but only recieved one. the shirts a good lifting shirt though. would be 5 stars if i got the correct order.
1,Labeled incorrectly.,I ordered these because they are cotton/poly blend. The three shirts I received are 100% cotton. I am not a happy camper.
3,Decent Shirt,"This is a decent shirt. Nothing fancy about it. It will shrink on you, so you might want to order one size bigger."
2,Fair,"Not as heavy as I'd like, and not very good to wear under a dress shirt (logo is too prominent, and the sleeves are longer than a short-sleeve dress shirt). To wear as your only shirt, it's definitely not as heavy-duty. I got a great sale price on them, so it's a fair deal..."
4,great vaue for the money,"For a moderate price, these tees are like the high quality ones that cost much more. No skrinkage or fading, I found them a very good value."
2,Wrinkles easy and cheaper quality,"You get what you pay for with these shirts. If only Russell had invested more money in quality instead of their fancy sleeve logo and lousy stamped neck tags. These shirts are 2"" shorter than other T-shirts I own and thinner in quality. They wrinkle worse after drying than my other shirts. Overall, not terrible but was expecting better based upon the reviews here."
2,"Oversized, not 100% cotton","Disappointing. The seller needs to do a better job of letting the customers know that the T-shirts sold on the same page are not all the same material. I wanted 100% cotton. Two shirts were, the two others were cotton/poly blends. I also wanted size medium. The tent-like proportions of their mediums are ridiculous. It's at least a size large, edging towards XL. They're cheap so I'm keeping them but I won't be buying this brand again."
3,Quality of Russell TeeShirts have changed.,"I have always purchased Russell teeshirts for my husband. However, these have drastically changed over the years. They were quite heavy and wore very well. The ones I recently purchased are no where near the quality of Russell T's I have purchased in the past. I can only assume they will not where as well. I gave them 3 stars because they are better then most of the colored teeshirts out there."
4,Big Comfy Shirt,"Actual shirt exceeded expectations i.e. It's fit is bigger and more comfortable and delivery was on time. Quality of material is borderline, since the price was so low."
3,"Cheap, do not look good","Cheap, do not look good,I look like someone live in the hospital with the shirt on menot as good as the champion ones"
4,Nice fit but felt a bit thin.,Nice fit running true to size but material felt a bit thin. Not sure how it will stand up to the rigors of a workout and washings but will update later.
4,Just Fine,"I bought this for a nightshirt and it works just fine. Quality seems to be fine, I have not had it long enough to judge how long it will last."
2,Size is not the correct fit,"I ordered this shirt in size 2XL, which is my normal t-shirt size. The shirt was 2XL, but was HUGE. Soft material, but so big it is awkward to wear. Very long for its size as well."
2,cheap shirt,"I've worn Russell shirts for years and my last two are showing their age and need to be replaced. Unfortunately these shirts were not up to the quality of my past shirts. These shirts were made with a much thinner cheaper feeling cotton fabric and it didn't like it would stand up to the rugged beating my current shirts have taken over the years. Very disappointing, and I returned them. If only I could find the same type of Russel shirts as I've purchased in the past."
1,Not the thick Russell T that I expected,These are not the thick Russell T-shirts that I originally had and expected to get. Instead these are much lighter and a longer size. Very disappointed. I would return them but not sure how to order the thicker T-shirts that I was really looking for. If anyone knows please let me know!
3,NOT 100% Cotton,"Under product features it states ""100% Cotton"" they are actually 58% polyester/42% cotton (at least the 2 I received which were Large colors-Graphite and Oxford). They will breathe, only because they are VERY lightweight. Very thin cotton that I do not expect to last more than a few washings. I would have been better off getting basic Hanes color T's at Walmart for $3.99 each.UPDATE 12/4/2009 - 3 years old now and they have held up fine. After researching the Russell Athletic website the gray tones are a poly mixture, the other colors are 100% cotton. If you are looking for the old-school heavy duty quality search for ""Russell Athletic PERFORMANCE"", these are the T's I grew up with and last for decades, but I'm overall happy with the basic line."
1,"These are NOT the good thick, high-quality Russell Ts.","If you're looking for the good, thick Russell Athletic T-shirts, do not waste your time with these. These are not them. I have a drawer full of R.A. T shirts, they're getting old. I wanted to replace some of them. I researched as best I could before buying these through Amazon.com. They came today. They're no better than the run-of-the-mill, thin, budget T-shirts that you can buy at Walmart. I'm sending the three I bought back."
3,Smaller than expected,Shirt was smaller than expected.. Quality was average. I was expecting better from this brand. Would not recommend to a friend.
1,shrank up to level that I will be sending it back,"Cloth was kind of rough to the feel so I washed it and it shrunk to a shorter size, so badly I will be sending it back"
2,Compilation of early solo works,"Made in USA in 1998, Serial# A-32983, Playing Time 51:10This CD lifts tracks from JB's work as a ""leader"", from his first solo effort (1968's ""Truth""), to his fourth (1972's ""Jeff Beck Group"").All the versions are full-length, and you can hear why his playing has influenced some many other guitarists. The only instrumental track is ""Rice Pudding"".This represents a nice introduction to his first few albums, before his venture into the ""Beck Bogert Appice"" power trio album.If you're curious about the music he made after leaving the YARDBIRDS, this is a great place to start. I'm sure you'll want the complete albums afterwards, so you might want to skip this all together and take a plunge: go for the ""Truth""..."
4,A nice peck of Beck for a small kopek,"While it is by no means definitive, this budget-line compilation does deliver a well-selected assortment of Jeff Beck gems at a low list price. Concentrating on the post-Yardbirds to pre-Jan Hammer stretch of Beck's career ('68-'72), the CD mixes some rousing numbers from his heavy metal period (the ""Truth"" and ""Beck-Ola"" albums featuring rooster-crowned Rod Stewart on vocals) with some of his slightly more jazzy-progressive forays on the two Jeff Beck Group LP's (self-titled and ""Rough & Ready""). Beck achieved an impressive growth spurt in the four-year period represented here; wisely dropping Stewart to concede the Power Trio + Preening Big Hair Vocalist Contest to former Yardbird bandmate Jimmy Page, and moving on to explore more innovative guitar territory (which later became known as ""fusion""). An excellent, low-investment primer for the neophyte Jeff Beck fan who may be curious about his younger days."
1,"Jeff Beck, Shapes of things","I received ""Shapes of Things"" by Jeff Beck and was surprized because it contained none of the songs on the ""Listen Tracks"" in the description. What I got on my ""Shapes of Things"" were songs that were more like Yardbird songs. There was no copywright date. Looks like a bootleg of some sort."
3,Somewhat damaged,"Remember, Godflesh guitarist/singer J.K.Broadrick once was a member of Napalm Death's legendary fist incarnation, along with N.J.Bullen and Mick Harris, who would later form their own industrial-dub project Scorn (again, with some help from Broadrick for their first longplayer ""Vae solis""). This self-titled album is a collection of very early Godflesh tracks and two additional remixes. The music really seems to be opposite of ND's high-speed grindcore. The tracks are often downtempo, and they are as hot, ropy, and devouring as lava, with rumbling bass-lines, droning guitars, and hardly intelligible, croaky vocals. Still, I don't find this album particularly interesting. Godflesh's later-era records like ""Songs of L & H"" and ""Us and them"" offer a greater variety of styles and moods and are more accessible than this relatively one-dimensional collection of soundscapes. Not a bad album, though, and probably a worthwhile purchase for hardcore fans."
4,"Cold, heavy and extremely hypnotic...","When I first heard the album, i thought it was a bit dull and boring, but when the second song started, i was blown away. it was so heavy! and so were the rest of the songs. highlights are spinebender, weak flesh (pure ... mosh) and wounds. wounds is a very long and repeative track wich is built on a single riff... very heavy indeed. get this album now ... ... you wont regret it"
3,Frustrated,This game is hard to control. I could not get pac man to go where I wanted him to. It is hard to get him to bounce to get up on top of roofs where the fruit is to collect.
1,Book not for beginner..very complicated no proper diagrams very confusing,If you are a beginner please don't buy this book...its waste of time and money...no proper explanation..very few diagrams there is no way you can understand ...
3,"Good, but not as good as it could be","I got this book because this is the book that seems to be recommended the most for people with an interest in building rubber-powered models. For the most part, it's a good book that does provide a good introduction to the hobby. However, I agree with a previous reviewer that a glossary would be helpful, and also this book is sorely in need of updating. It's clear that the book was written some time ago, and the copyright's just been renewed periodically. The instructions for the models could really use a parts list of what's needed (so that you don't have to go thru the directions over and over again trying to figure out what you need), and I think the book in general needs a good editing."
3,Rubber Powered Model Airplanes: Comprehensive?,"Having recently purchased and read Don Ross' RUBBER POWERED MODELS:COMPREHENSIVE BUILDING AND FLYING BASICS, PLUS ADVANCED DESIGN YOUR OWN INSTRUCTION, I have a suggestion to the author and/or publisher.....provide a glossary of definitions to define the many abbreviations that the ""veteran"" hobbyist use. Since the book is aimed mainly at the ""newcomer"" that may not understand ""OOS"" means ""Out Of Sight""(for example) he/she may feel that the text is too technical miss the great advice of an experienced modeler. This is not a criticism but a suggestion coming from someone that enjoyed the book, but wondered what a few of the abbreviations meant. I especially liked the chopping tool plan. Thank you for an informative book on a great hobby."
5,"Well written, every thing for the beginer to the expert.",I was pleasantly surprised at the completness of this book. I will be able to use this book in my 9th grade technology class for basic flight information. The advanced information will also be used by the students entering the science olympiad.
3,Complaint,"While I am impressed with the overall performance of the saw,its light weight, plenty of power for ripping, its easy to see where the blade is,and is very smooth in the startup, it does have one very serious flaw...the thumb screw and the mounting plate , where it screws into on the saw, (so that you can set the saw on a bevel) are made of aluminum, and with very much use or any over tightening, they both strip out and render the saw near useless.This is both frustrating and annoying to the saw owner, not to mention costly. I have purchased two of these saws so far and this has happened to both of them.Currently I have become quite disenchanted with this and have gone to purchasing a more reliable brand."
2,Activity Center should be sold with doll.,"You really need the center to play with the doll unless you have other interactive pieces at home. The food for the doll comes with the center as well as the rooms that make it toddler aged...my daughter wanted it for the potty training area but when she got it, she realized the doll didnt undress to actually train her.It is a must buy if you get the doll; just try to buy on sale. I don't like it because it is hard to store. It is prettly flimsy to break down with every use. You will need somekind of container for the pieces or they are easily lost."
3,"Santa gave it to me, wasnt the best","Daughter review-I thought it was going to be pretty much fun. But, without the doll for it, it wasnt really fun at all. I would say if you buy this toy you should buy the doll with it. I like the sounds that it makes, the sounds when you flush the toilet. It comes with a blanket and pillow and fake food. But it doesnt come with the doll. :("
1,This playcenter fell apart minutes after it was given to the children,might be okay for a calm and careful 7 or 8 year old. My 5 yr. old tore it apart in a minute or less. Comes back apart very easy
3,cute but bulky,"This toy is cute and my daughter likes it, but she doesn't play with it much now because we had to put it in a corner under a table in our small house and it's hard to get to. Why didn't they design it so that it could fold up when not in use??? It looks like it can, but it cannot. Our house is being overrun with bulky toys that can't fit back into the boxes they came in and can't be stored or stacked. Get wise, toy manufacturers -- some of us live in SMALL houses!"
2,Not the greatest,"I gave this to my granddaughter and her mother had the hardest time putting it together. Not only are there no instructions (pictures or text), there is no description of anything you can do with the desk and the doll. You have to guess where to push buttons and when. There is also one button that both the desk and the doll talk at the same time. Confusing!!! Really not worth the money spent."
4,great toy for the price,"I have to say that this toy was great for the price, it is NOT durable or doesn't stay together very well. BUT, it was worth it becuase my daughter absolutely loved it and still does. But, it is a pain because you constantly have to put it back together. I finally stopped and she didnt care too much because she just liked the flushing sound and the abc sound."
1,Terrible toy!,"I usually don't write reviews but I was very disappointed by this toy and I only paid $10.00 with free shipping. It is a total piece of junk. I actually threw it away less than a month after Christmas. My daughter seemed to enjoy it a little when it was assembled but it was constantly falling over and falling apart. If you have younger children in the house, I especially don't recommend it. It is very cheaply made and doesn't hold up to use by children, even when they are being careful."
4,Cute!,"My 3 1/2 year old got this for Christmas, and she loves it. It has a dry erase board with pen, and a little storage bin to put the pillow and blanket in. It makes a flushing sound for the toilet, and the cell phone rings when taking it out of its holder. The sounds aren't long and annoying like some toys. It was easy to assemble. I would definitley recommend this item."
2,Play All Day Activity Center,"This item is very cheaply made. Some parts do not stay together, etc. I am happy with the price I paid for it through Amazon---thankfully I didn't pay what it was selling for in stores! But did notice right after Christmas it was on clearance for approximately 70% off. That alone lets you know it is not of the best quality. My daughter tried to enjoy this toy, but with pieces falling off she just got fed up. It has been the least played with of her toys. She owns numerous Little Mommy products and really enjoys the dolls. The retail prices of of the Toddler Doll and Activity Center certainly led me to believe they would have been of better quality."
2,Not worth the money!,We bought this for our 5 year old for Christmas and were thoroughly disappointed. It has several cardboard pieces and doesn't stay together. I would not recommend this to ANYONE!!
5,Finally found this Favorite Scent!,"Warm, 'scentual', just purrrect this scent for me and oh way too difficult to find anywhere! Am delighted to be able to purchase this small bottle of this parfum; how I wish that it were available in a larger size that is NOT a spray, and not so large that it cost me almost $200.00! Thanks Amazon for carrying this lovely scent!"
2,a OK product,"I like the rose aroma very much! However, I feel the mist is not so effective per spray, at least to my skin. I have to have several sprays to make my skin feel good"
2,Scented Water,"This is just rose water. Face feels cool and refreshed when applied, but it doesn't do anything other than that. It would be cheaper to buy it locally or make it yourself."
2,The most dissatisfying of the Brother Cadfael mysteries.,"Though I love Brother Cadfael, this story was most tedious and far-fetched. I couldn't believe that this young woman would do what she did for a man she hardly knew, and the conclusion drags out too long and elaborately, once you realize who she is. I've read worse books, but after the true excellence of most of the other Cadfael novels, this one was a strange, sad let-down."
3,The first Cadfael I've solved halfway through the book.,"The book was enjoyable in that I enjoy her style of writing, but it wasn't up to her normal quality. Either I'm much more perceptive than I used to be (not likely!) or this book gave away far too much far too early. But since I'm reading them in chronological order, I'm looking forward to the next one."
5,"Interesting, Thought-provoking Story","One of the best in Ellis Peters' outstanding series of medieval whodunits, this tale is written with her usual carefully chosen words, styled to fit the setting, and lyrical in description and dialogue. I re-read this tale at least once a year, because even when you know the unraveling of the mystery, the craft behind the story telling continues to enlighten, inspire and teach on many levels. It is a wonderful parallel comparison of loyalty, selfless service, constancy. Narration by Roe Kendall enriches the action and assists with characterization, pulling the listening reader into the action."
4,Eats Wood!,"I looked at all the planers. I was going to buy a planer with AMPS being my first concern. With a 3.4 amp motor this planer did not fail once. I put this machine to work on rough cut white oak with the blades full bore, and I got tired before this Hitachi planer. My only wish is the shoe as in all planers in this class was 1 inch longer. With a longer shoe or base this would get 5 stars. At this price you cannot go wrong. Blades are a snap to change, and sharpen. This is a nice machine."
2,"Entertaining, but not very helpful","This book was OK. There were some good pieces but there was so much whining in it I found myself getting terribly annoyed. I also found it to be very, very politically correct.There are some good, entertaining essays, but some of the writing is HORRIBLE. Especially the non-essays where the editors are talking about the modern world and how they work. It's just not very original. It didn't tell me anything I didn't already know.It's a great idea for a book, but it just doesn't seem representative to me. The pieces don't remind me of people I know in my twenties. Some one else could do a better job."
5,Voices of beauty from the past,"My 4 year old picked this book off the shelf at the library. I didn't realize, until I sat down to read it to her at home, that the quotations are beyond her comprehension. She loved the book anyway, for its charming illustrations of children, nature, and simple pleasures.Mixed with familar verses are poems from forgotten out-of-print writers, about the things in life that are eternal and will always bring delight and happiness. It's a winner."
5,Sweet Little Book !!,"I Love Tasha Tudor !! ""Springs of Joy"", one of her many published works, is a treasure to have. Page by page the exquisite illustrations just tug at my heartstrings. When I want to go to a place when I'm having a hectic day, I just pick up one of Tasha's books and curl up in a chair and fall into her beautiful world. Simply pleasurable !!! This book should be on everyones bookshelf, children and adults alike!"
5,pleased customer,I was pleased with my purchase. Loved the shoes and was pleased with the great price!
3,Good starting book if you can tolerate all the errors.,"This is a decent book for getting started on VBScript and very basic HTML. Make sure you know HTML or have a good reference handy since there are enough typos and mistakes to really frustrate a beginner. (The CD that comes with Laura Lemay's ActiveX and VBScript contains an HTML book that got me through.)I downgraded the score mostly due to the typos in the code like missing quotes and such. The section on Frames gives step by step instructions but leaves out a vital part while not explaining things very well. The book was obviously never proofed by someone who didn't know the subject and that is the target audience. It's not an HTML book, but if the instructions are there, they should be correct.The sample code is available from a web site and the first one I copied did not work due to careless typos in the script code. I found it highly annoying."
2,Too many errors in sample codes...,"Visual Quickstart Guides are generally comprehensive and easy on the eyes. However, I found too many errors in the sample codes of Thurrott's book to warrant anything above 2 stars!! Thank my lucky stars(!) that I am familiar with VB5 and VBA to correct most of the code ""on the spot"" while trying out the samples. All in all, this could have been a good book, but from all the frustrations in correcting the errors, I suggest that no one buys this book until the author uses a spell checker and/or at least goes through the book a second time to debug his own sample codes."
5,Simple is a virtue,If you're a programmer and just want to know what are the basics of html and vbscript? This is the book to read. It's simple and concise. I really enjoyed it. [It] is a bargain.
5,"Thin in size, thick in true helpfulness!!!","I agree with the guy from Texas, I should've got this one first. Long ago, I bought the VB Script in 21 Days book and didn't really learn a thing. This book shows you exactly what the syntax means and does in a very easy to understand, colorized format. Excellent buy."
3,"Quick access to good info, but, several annoying mistakes","The format of the book is good. It allows quick access to vital information. It also shows key/new areas color coded in red. I knew nothing about VBScript before reading this book. Now I feel I can write basic scripts without problems. The book also did a good job by not spending too much time on unnecessary introductory topics, like operators, etc.The drawback of this book is the multitude of typos and some mistakes regarding Microsoft's Document Object Model. I found it frustrating to try some examples and not having them work. However, I learned a lot from fixing the examples."
5,My girl Jenny Lopez.,"First of all, Jenny has never claimed to be Mariah Carey; Jenny is a simply a very good all-around entertainer. She also happens to be a nice Puerto Rican girl who got out of the projects. So why does everyone like to hate on her? Yes, it would be nice if she gave back more to the community, but does not doing so make her the spawn of Satan? Come on; give me a break! The bottom line is that this right here - while definitely not grammy material - is nevertheless an entertaining song. For those of you who insist on hating on her; just get over it already."
3,Mixed reviews...,"I like the beats, the rap and everything.What I don't like is that she has the ability to come off like a real person when she's really plastic. I mean she doesn't need to make this song to cover up for the dirt she keeps shoveling (stealing music, perfumes, etc). I get the feeling that she wants people to see her as a really down to earth girl, but she doesn't act like it.I have been a huge fan of hers since day 1 but now I am not intersted. and it's a shame cause she had some talent there."
1,i heard better music ...,"this song SUCKS! how MANY times must jennifer REMIND us she is from the bronx? i know she's proud to be from the bronx,but good grief lay off saying it so damm much!this song reminds me of something i heard in the 80's it was a cross between early house and cotton candy much like this song!in this song jennifer tries WAY too hard to get the cliche message across of ""please stay real"" in her song Unfortenly for her this backfired on her!she may pretend to care,but does she really?she should take her own adivice for a change and knock it off with the cliche ""stay yourself"",""be real"" messages in her songs!cause this is the radio,clubs,mtv,vh1,muchmusic,etc were talking about here.skip this single..."
1,Go Back To The Bronx,"For Jennifer Lopez, she really needs to start finding a way to get herself out on the road. For her latest single, Jenny From The Block, she claims she is still the same girl she was, but she was just too sarcastic in fashion with that in mind. Still, she really has to get herself away from being the Milli Vanilli of Latin Pop, and prove that she can really sing. To be honest with you, I think her beau sings better than she can."
2,Liked it at first,"This was just what I wanted - a black disposer screen. However, after only a few months the grid started breaking. It's just not strong enough."
5,Excellent disposer screen,"This works great for us. It lets only the small items through and catches the big ones. Easy to take out, very easy to clean, and just drop it back in. Doesn't get slimy and gross like the ones with the tiny holes and has a more modern look. We are on a septic so I make sure to run the disposall any time things go through. One time I turned the water on quickly and it dislodged but it hasn't happened again and was no problem, just push it back into place. I only mention this because if you have very high water pressure and are always turning it on full blast with the stream right over the screen, maybe this could get annoying? Not a problem for me though."
5,"""FOR GOOD SOLID ROCK ONLY!!!""","THIS HEADSET IS HAS GOOD QUALITY SOUND BALANCE, YOU HEAR AND FEEL EVERTHING. THEY ARE LIGHTWEIGHT AND COMFORTABLE TO YOUR EARS, WITH JUST THE RIGHT PRESSURE...I LOVE 'EM. PUT ON YOUR BEST ROCK CD'S, TURN UP THE ""V""....AND LET'S ROCK DUDES AND DUDETTES!!!"
5,Old School/New school,This book is long overdue!! I laughed and learned and found myself wanting to get out and fish!! I read it during the late Winter doldrums and now that I'm out on the water I appreciate having read this book. If you're looking for a super-technical treatise on flyfishing stay away. If you're looking to join some super guys on some great angling adventures pick it up today. You leave it better angler and enjoy your own fishing experince even more. You won't be dissapointed!!
4,Not just for the fisherman,"As someone who doesn't fish, I really enjoyed this book. What a great read! These guys fish in places you would never dream of, from the outflow of a nuclear power plant to a highway pullover. No doubt these guys are fanatical about their fishing, and would scale any fence to quench that thirst, but they don't take themselves or their sport too seriously, and that's what helped make this such a fun read."
3,Lots of good tips,"This seems like it will be a good book, once I can get thru the background explanations about yoga. I haven't gotten too far into it yet, but I skimmed through the book and am already using some of the breathing techniques before and during my rides."
5,"""Smooth as your Razor""",This an excellent cross cutting blade. Also works fantastic in a miter saw. The finish it produces would be hard to improve on. Thought I would have to get a more expensive Forrest Woodworker I to get results this good. Absolute satisfaction in buying this blade!
4,good for the right job,"I gave it 4 stars because it is an O.K. blade. I bought it for cutting 3/4"" oak plywood (table saw). I was happy with the results, but not impressed. It worked well with other types of wood. Would I buy again? Only if I had to, due to choices available at that time. Price should be $69.99 for what you get."
3,Awesome Cuts!,"Buy this blade! I put it in my Bosch contractors table saw with a zero clearance insert, and it makes the cleanest cuts I have ever seen. No tearout at all in 3/4"" birch plywood crosscuts, and a glass smooth edge. Just as nice cuts in hardwoods, melamine and MDF. Freud makes the best bits and blades!"
3,Not as good as I had hoped.,"I was disappointed with this replacement for my miter saw. Doesn't cut as well as the factory blade it replaced and tends to burn maple. As others have said it does leave a glass-like cut, though. I'll probably replace it with a Forrest."
4,"Leaves the hair very soft, but contains mineral oil","I really like this deep cond't. The softness of my hair last to the next shampoo day (I shampoo twice a week.)I mix 1/2 of the container with Silk Essences Cholesterol cond't. There's little black stuff surrounded by white fuzzy thing inside this cond't. Looking at the ingredients list, I cant figure out what it could be. I am not a big fan of mineral oil, but this product works for me. Sally Beauty store had this on their discontinue list. The price is under 3.00. I purchased two on 03.27.11. The clerk said she doesnt know when the final shippment will be. I am not willing to pay over 7.00 plus S/H for this. When there's something good....companies find a way to mess with it or stop making it all together."
3,Unknown,"My friend never used but I thought it was a great product, Price was fair as well, Wish I would have kept."
2,Disappointing wine coaster,"This wine coaster looked nice online. However, when I received it, I was disappointed. The inside had a plastic piece that I assume was meant to hold the bottle upright. It made it look tacky. Because I bought it as a gift, I didn't have time to return it; I gifted it anyhow. Sorry, birthday girl!"
1,Defeats the Purpose,We bought this to prevent drips from running down the bottle and staining the table. But since the coaster sticks to the bottom when you tilt to pour the drips in the coaster come out anyway. Disappointed
1,A Schubert Medley for those who don't know Schubert's Music,"That anyone could present this music as a long lost Schubert symphony and get away with it is amazing! It serves as a reminder how hard it is for anyone to write ""a la Schubert"" without simply stealing themes actually by Schubert. What we have here is a motly heap of cut and pasted tidbits, borrowed from various chamber works, the Wanderer Fantasy and even Winterreise! Perhaps the worst of it is the Andante movement which brings together rip-offs from the Great C major, with what sounds like suspiciously like part of the Andante from Mendelssohn's Italian Symphony, which then grotesquely morphs into the ""Wanderer"" theme! Perhaps we can look forward to a new Mendelssohn Symphony? At any rate, Schubert fans are advised not to waste your money!"
5,Wonderful book of substance,"I am a teacher, and a man. I teach students whose native language is not English, ages 12-14. My girl students are drawn to this book on their own. I taught this book to my boy students, and I was again struck by its beauty and impact. The boys liked the book, whether they admit it or not. It builds a great story out of simple text. Read it -- you will find complex themes: the wisdom of age versus the impetuousness of youth, and humility from experience. It is one of the more substantial books I have found for early readers -- not as rich as The Giving Tree, but very good."
2,cheap junk,"I bought this because it was the only thing that I could find that would fit the slot of the Hitachi bandsaw. It fails in several regards. First, it is loose in the slot. I would guess there are about 0.04 (1/32) inches of play between the miter gauge bar and the slot, and there is no adjustment. Second, the pivot on the miter gauge is loose, and there is no way to tighten it. This pivot slop probably adds an additional degree or two of play in the system. I gave this two stars instead of one because for the price I don't think it is reasonable to expect much more. I only needed it for making very rough cuts, and it is good enough for that. The alternative was to make my own since I was unable to find any other product that would fit the very shallow slot in the table."
5,Wulf and Wulfin,"The second book of the series comes to an end with the wolves of time(from an earlier book-journeys to the heartland) when the Mennen(mankind) destroy everything the wolves know and a few of the pups get killed too which is quite sad. Amazingly graphic and with intense descriptions makes you want to read on through this book of adventure,love and friendship. I couldn't put the book down and when it was over, I wanted the sequel to be a trilogy! I didn't want to put the book down because I felt like I was one of the pack, just totally wild and almost free. I loved the ending although it made me cry... A book that's definitely worth reading because it questions the morals of men and whether we should ""own"" the planet since there are other animals we share it with..."
4,"I Don't Know Why, But I Like It",Lo-Fi garage/punk. I listen to everything from rock to country to folk to jazz to blues. Somehow this thing keeps making it's way back into my CD player every few months - I really can't explain it.
2,"Wonderful lady, Terrible book.","I saw a clip on the author, her traveling lifestyle and her use of herbs and jumped in and bought three of her books. They are terrible. I had hope that this book would be a nice story of her time in Ny. Instead it was a rambley, compilation of the gypsies she met there. I can't even bring myself to finish it."
1,Learning Spanish or English,This is a very useful book for teaching or learning English or Spanish. Highly recommended.
3,A good Book to explore,A Good Book to explore the culture and history of the pain that they went through. The struggle which we don't see or realize.
4,very affordable and very functional,"It holds quite a bit of stuff with only suction cups as a mount. I have no complaints for what it cost. We have 3.5"" wall tile in our shower and the suction cups fit well within each tile. If you have smaller tile, you may not get the same results. If the cups cross grout lines they won't hold suction."
2,poor design,I am still trying to get all 4 suction cups to stick. It makes for an unstable mount. something should be done to use other cups or something else.rich sottilaro
1,Design defects,"This product is made of poor quality material. It does not even deserve a star. The shelves are not in right angles, so there's no way for four suction cups to hold on the conner walls at the same time, that is, it can't hold in place. The whole thing kept falling apart. I did not even get a chance to put anything on the shelves. I returned it."
1,Piece of junk!,"This looks good, but after you hang it up it falls apart. You have to nail it to the wall if you want it to stay in place. The other options won't hold. Don't buy this unless you want to nail the wall in the bathroom!"
3,Keeps Shower Organized with Showering and Hair Products,This product helped keep my bathroom shower organized with various other bath and hair products. All my shower needs are now close at hand rather than on the shower floor.
2,Thin plastic,"The vertical supports are very thin plastic, take care in assembly it feels like it will break easily.It comes with suction cups ,but would like to see silicone included for more of a secure mount."
1,Not worth the money!,"Worked well for first couple months, although the metal bar fell off pretty quickly. Then about a month later the top shelf fell off, breaking the plastic tabs and making the top shelf useless. A few weeks after that the bottom shelf slid off the wall after the adhesive tape started pulling away, breaking that shelf as well. It was only holding a light bottle of shampoo and a partial bar of soap at the time. Do not waste your money!"
4,Buying another one...,I bought this years ago in Target and after many years of use the bottom shelf finally broke. The plastic snapped. I am buying another one b/c for the money it was worth it for how long it lasted.
2,It worked well...for a while,"I actually am on Amazon because I am looking for a new shower caddy because I currently own this particular one and it's broken. It held fairly well (with a few random falls) for a while (almost a year), but has recently been falling more and more frequently. The suction cups move on the tiles which causes the whole thing to collapse and everything on it to fall off. If the suction cups weren't made to give the caddy its structure, the whole thing wouldn't just give out when a suction cup needs to be reapplied or slides on the tile. In a recent fall, a few pieces broke off. Being that is it plastic, I guess that is to be expected. Basically, this thing was great for a temporary shelf but if you are looking for something long term, and are annoyed by having to pick your shampoos and soaps up off the shower floor every few days when it collapses over time, like myself, perhaps choose a different shower caddy."
4,Works for the Price,"A plastic caddy is what to be expected, Its plastic and a little on the weak side. I have an older caddy that was installed about 5 years ago and it still holds a quart bottle of shampoo. But hit it with your arm and it can break. On this new one the suction cups are worthless. So far the adhesive has been holdng. But for the price it works for me."
3,Suctions not that good.,"As EVERY one knows, shampoos and conditioner bottles are heavy and the suctions are very cheap. I stuck it in the corner of my bathtub and it works ok. I would not buy it again."
1,Cannot use in tiled showers!,"I bought this to use in my tiled shower (and the tiles are a very generic size--not especially large or small). I tried to put this into my shower, but the suction cups line up RIGHT between the tiles, so you can't get any suction whatsoever. I had to send it back."
3,Not On My Table,"At first glance, this is a tough, heavy-duty machine that is surprisingly quiet at lower RPM. Problems arise when attempting to fit it to a router table. The single wrench and spindle lock system for tightening the chuck is clumsy and puts fingers much too close to the wrench. The slightest slip when tightening or loosening a bit will result in skinned knuckles. It also makes the machine very difficult to hold on to while changing bits. A two-wrench system would be far better for this application. The 1/2"" collet seems a trifle indersized, at least on mine, making changing bits a chore."
4,Hitachi Workhorse,"The M12V 3-1/4 HP router is a solid piece of equipment that will do the job for many years to come. It is easy to use and comes with the accessories you will need for a variety of routing tasks. The adjusting knob is easy to use and quite accurate. The instructions are clear and easy to understand. I would recommend to someone who is looking for a reliable big router. For the price, I feel it is a bargain."
4,Serious Router For Table Work,"I use this router on a table only because it is too heavy and powerful for hand routing. However, as a table router it is a serious machine with power enough for most any job.The electronic speed control works fine and the fine adjustment on the plunge feature is very useful for setting the exact depth of cut.The base is made to accept guides which are mostly useful for hand routing. This base design restricts the opening size and limits the diameter of the bit the router can accept to medium size and below. The larger diameter bits, like some raised panel cutters, won't fit.Overall, it's a powerful, heavy-duty machine ideally suited for table work. And, Hitachi has a large network of Service Centers."
3,Dissapointed about the quality,"Yes, the router is very powerful. The balance is fantastic. It is heavy but not forbiding for hand-held operation. But the quality of the non-motor parts is dismal. The adjustment knob is a joke. So flimsy you think you have to have assembled it wrong. The plunging mechanism is anything but smooth. It just did not work for me."
5,Best Bang for Your Buck!,"I reciently purchased this when a 1 1/2hp plunge router (different name brand) couldn't hack it. The Hitachi M12V is a dream to work with, smooth starts, adjustable speeds, micro-adjustable depth, and plenty of power to spare. I couldn't believe what I had been missing. If you're looking for a 3hp plunge router, the Hitachi M12V is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget. I'll be getting a second one for my router table!"
4,big sky ed,"the hitachi m12v is all i hoped for and has done everything that i have ask of it. the only thing that i had trouble with is the 1/4"" chuck, it would be better if it was an interchangeable one but for the price its a great machine."
3,somewhat disappointed,"I had heard some good things about this router but after using it I am somewhat disappointed in it. It is not as easy to change bits as I was lead to believe and I am very disappointed in the height adjustment system. The adjustment knob does not fit tight and is not easy to get at when using this router on a router table. The power is adequate and the soft start is good and it seems to be quieter than many that I have used. Over all it is what I would consider average, I would not buy another one."
2,Not for undermounting,"I got his router to mount under a table for making doors. Not good for this appilcation at all. Bits are hard to change while base is mounted to table, and it didn't seem to have the power it said it had. Only lasted about 6 mons and then croaked. I replaced it with a Porter Cable. Should have gotten one of those in the first place......"
4,"Nice, nice, nice router for the money","I love the performance and features of this router. For the money, I'm not sure you can do better. It's very quiet for a universal motor-driven tool, and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great. I bought this specifically for a router table I built, and it has performed flawlessly in that capacity. I've done some hand-held routing with it and it works good for that as well. Smooth plunging mechanism. The guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid. The only thing I hate (and this pretty much goes for any router I've used) is changing the bits. It's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router, activate the chuck lock, and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up. Even with that, I highly recommend this router - outstanding performer."
5,It ROCKS!!!,"This router appeared in my wife's gold box a few weeks ago, and she knew I was looking to upgrade my Craftsman 1/4"" fixed base router. She told me to take a look at it, and after reading reviews here and at other sites, I told her to get it. What an upgrade!!! I have only used it with the 1/4"" collet and a 1/2"" round over bit, but I love how it starts up with little torque and runs very quietly. The depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the M12V than it was on my old router. The handles make it very comfortable to use and I experience little vibration. Combine this with the excellent price we got in the Gold Box, and I'm really happy. I'm sure I don't use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers, but I really like it! Now I need to get some 1/2"" bits..."
1,Didn't buy it,"I looked at this router and bought a Makita. The Hitachi is made in Malasyia, and looked cheap compared with the Makita, which is made in the USA. I have hade such poor luck with other tools (a Bosch drill) made in Malasyia, that I could not see getting it. If you think you are saving $40 getting the Hitachi, you are right, and you are also getting a router worth $40 less than a Makita."
3,Could be better but not bad,The timing tends to be superb better than alot of professional Karaoke bars (I am 1 of those BSB obsessed fans so I know when its off instantaneously). Sometimes the music is on the ball and sometimes its off its most off with the 1st song I have to say. Same goes for the vocals though I think the vocals are even better than the sound. Its funny because it either hits it perfect or variations of missing.
1,Spellbinding,Hard to say when fiction crosses into reality. A great story of life with the consequences of prejudice and hatred. Unfortunately it's still with us today.
4,Marvelous,This was such a wonderful story about friendship. I will tell my friends and colleagues that this is a must read.
4,Nice addition to my Kindle library. I am always appreciative of a good book offering for my Kindle. Thank you!,Nice addition to my Kindle library. I am always appreciative of a good book offering for my Kindle. Thank you!
5,One of the best books I've read in ages,"This book was moving, sad, poignant and delightful. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The character development was excellent. I knew little of what we did to our citizens from Japan and learned a great deal. I was a child when the voting rights conflict was occurring in the South. Her story brought back those memories. I was caught up in the characters and wondered how these friends were going to reconnect. I felt the pain, grief and loneliness of Augie. Enjoy!"
5,All The Way Home by Ann Tatlocm,This is an excellent book very emotional and keeps you reading. Recommend to all who enjoy history as well as human interaction.
4,Lots of History and educational,This book is written in a time period I haven't read much about. It was very interesting and as far as I could tell pretty accurate.
5,Quality fiction writing at its best,"This is an incredible book with layer upon layer of story. It follows the life of Augusta Callahan, from her childhood experiences with her ""adoptive"" Japanese family to her involvement in civil rights in 1965 Mississippi. The injustice of the WWII Japanese internment camps is juxtaposed with the grievous treatement of African-Americans in the 1960's South. In the midst of this, we see how Augie's experiences and encounters are molding and shaping her. The quality of Ann Tatlock's writing is top-notch, creating a very readable and absorbing story--written so beautifully that the reader stops to savor the words and phrases themselves. Well worth the cost, you won't want to put this book down and you won't be able to get your mind off it weeks after you have read the end."
4,Great knife,"It cuts well, I love the lock release on the side instead of in the back where most knives are nowadays. I've found the seatbelt cutter is a great tool to have, but I've only used it on things besides seatbelts. The blunt tip helps me keep from stabbing myself when I have to saw something. Love the serration. Works like a charm.The only complaint I have is that the screws holding on the belt clip like to come loose. I have to tighten those down every month or so. I lost one, but its so small that there is no finding it."
3,Not easy to open one-handed,"The knife is excellent in all respects except that I have great difficulty opening it with one hand. If the thumb stud were positioned a little lower on the blade for better leverage, it would be perfect for the intended purpose."
4,Gerber Hinderer Rescue,"Solid feel and smooth action using one hand. I also like the added seatbelt cutter, not sure if I would use it, but makes me feel a tad more secure knowing it's there."
4,"Great knife, strange fit in sheath","I really like the knife, but I can't figure out how to pack the accessory tools and knife into the sheath at the same time. I checked the included paperwork, but no hints. I can fit the tools or the knife, but not both without feeling like I'm about to pop some seams or tear the material. The knife has a pocket clip though, so it's OK."
5,Perfect tool for firefighter/paramedic,"I am a career firefighter/paramedic with seven years on the job. I have already used the knife several times on EMS calls. Four times I have used the oxygen wrench (we all know how the black tabs seem to get lost), and I have used the Zuess tool (belt cutter) and window punch on a couple of MVA's with extrication. Also used it on several trauma patients to expose them. Far superior to trauma shears. The knife is great for all around uses around the firehouse. Highly recommended."
4,Gerber 22-41534 Hinderer Rescue Knife with Serrated Edge and Sheath,"I purchased this knife for my professional fire fighter husband. He says, ""It's a little big, but all the nice little design features are cool."" He likes the built in oxygen tank tool.The additional bonus wrench tools were weird and not very useful, a strange thing to add in with this knife.Gerber 22-41534 Hinderer Rescue Knife with Serrated Edge and Sheath"
3,Probably not worth the money.,Got it for a gift. Description of product was a lot better than actual product. It's ok. But look around before you buy.
5,good stuff,"my parrot ""Lucky"" loves this food, I could not buy it locally anymore so I am very happy to find it. It arrived in great shape , fresh and did not take as long to recieve as I thought.Thanx Kathy"
1,Buyer Beware,"This is a cute film with one major flaw. It has been dubbed in English, rather than subtitled. There is no menu to change the options. If, like me, you can't stand dubbed films, stay away from this one. I returned my copy, but I notice that the Amazon site still refers to this as being in Norwegian with English subtitles."
1,Disappointed,"This was a cute story. I think it is written for a very young audience, 3 - 5 year olds. My granddaughter is 11 and I believe she will find this too babyish."
3,I don't know about this one.,I read it as soon as I got it. I personally wasn't impressed with the effectablitiy of it to help with nightmares but I haven't read it to my granddaughter yet.
5,Perfect!,"I finally found the perfect face cushion to break my fall when hugging the porcelain goddess after a long night of drinking. No longer will I have to fear the bruising pain of slamming my face into the hard surface of a toilet seat! Never again will I wake the next day to find my face still pressed cold against that unforgiving seat of doom.It also doubles as a splash guard, though you'll still need someone to hold back your hair. Just put the cushion in place, kneel, and start heaving!"
1,Sucks,"This set of games were all toghether the worst games I havebought. It contains Su-27 flanker, Team Apache, Steel Panthers III,and Peoples General. It was an exceptional deal for the amount of games in the pack but the quality was , well plain and simple, sucky. The grapics on Su-27 Flanker were sucky maybe running at the speed 386 computer. Steel Panthers and Peoples General are about the suckeist strategy games I've ever incountered. I only exception to the game pack was Team Apache. I highly discourage anyone from buying this game pack and advise looking for a diffrent game. END"
3,becoming dated...,"How one American family unites for holidays, featuring photos of an extended family at their cabins in Virginia, New York, the Carribean, including holiday recipes, herb gardens, children in costumes. Today, this might be depicted through a family blog, although today's American family might decorate their retreats with objects from the 30s and 40s rather than Early America."
1,Misguided Physics applied to Biology,"While I admire the enthusiasm the author I was shocked by the sloppy physics.His arguments for coherent electromagnic interactions within the lossy tissues of an organism make no sense.His knowledge of quantum mechanics is,at best,that of a diletant.No doubt he has read a great deal ,but given the large number of misstatements and errors, I doubt that he has understood more than a small fraction of the serious material.On the basis of the excellent reviews of the book,(before actually reading it myself)I recommended it to two friends (physicists) who bought it. Both are angry with me.Having read it I can not recommend it to anybody."
5,One of the best Karajan concert video !,"The Karajan concert video series filmed in the 1980s were directed and edited by Karajan himself, and most of people do not like the way he filmed his own concerts. The angles were restricted and there was even no one whole view of the orchestra. Furthermore, the Karajan in the 1980s was already an ailing master and you could not see his passion easily from these video.So this live concert film of the 1977 New Year's Eve concert of the Beethoven 9th is so precious because you can see an energetic Karajan and most importantly, the film was directed by Humphrey Burton, who was the top concert film director at the time, not Karajan himself. This means you can really enjoy a great concert experience. The sound quality is top-class as well.So if you are a big fan of Karajan, this DVD is a must-have !"
4,DVD Region,The 2 CDs are very cool. I love them. The bonus DVD contained drifting car performance. But the disc is Region 2 (for Japan).
3,Be warned!,"I bought these to match oil-rubbed cabinet knobs that I also ordered from Amazon. However, these pulls have copper highlights. Not what I was looking for and they don't match the knobs. Now that I look at the photo closely, I can see the copper details. They're very pretty but if you're looking for solid black, these aren't for you."
2,Not-fine adjustment,"If you are purchasing this item because you want micro adjustment, save your cash. This knob is threaded onto a coarse threaded rod. In my world, the word micro means 'very small'. A fine threaded rod would have been better here. In my review of the router itself I mention this as well. Replace the threaded rod with a fine threaded rod. Buy a couple of nuts to fit it and a knurled knob. Bam... in comparison this would be a micro adjustment knob. Also, if you are using any taller bits, the micro adjustment knob has to be backed of so far that it comes off the top of the threaded rod. Where is the micro adjustment in this. For those of you using this a router for your table... I can imagine that a nut attached to a small fly handle would be better...faster adjusting any way. Of course you still have the coarse threaded rod to make those super fine adjustments."
1,Why did I buy this item?,"I purchased this item, when it was offerd at the time I purchased my Hitachi M 12V, and spent an additional $25.00 plus shipping and handeling on it. Today I received my new router and found a very similar ""Fine Adjustment Knob"" in the box with the other attachments provided. I wish Amazon would not have suggested / offered this item seperatly, when it was already included in the package I was purchasing."
5,SAMe,"My 15 year old American Eskimo uses this. She now has her normal 3 speeds back - fast, slow, and stop. This product is available from the vet, but it costs much more."
2,Great product Vendor is selling it for twice as much as any other vendor,"The product, which I have been giving to my dogs for the past year or so is great - however, the vendor that Amazon recommends - I bought it through Amazon cause i was in a hurry, but never again, this is not the first time that this happens - sells the product for twice as much as any other vendor online - for the price $27 I could have bought twice as much (a bottle with 60 instead of 30 pills). Bottom line, the product is great, the vendor, including Amazon sucks - worse than Goldman Sachs."
4,As advertised,"This is the correct fence for the saw and attaches easily with the thumb screw allready on the saw.Smallest rip is about 1/2""."
2,Bends easily!,Rip guide bent during first use when tightening the screw. It also doesn't fit properly in my C7SB2 case where it should. Hard to recommend.... be gentle with it!
1,Do Not Buy,"This is not needed, if your cutting a bunch of boards, then use a board for a guide. I never took itout of the package and kicked myself for ordering it. Hitachi power tools are well made though, this isjust not needed."
5,"Well designed, well machined","Just finished installing two sets of these, and they're a pleasure to work with. They are well designed and well machined, working smoothly, installing easily, and doing exactly what they say they will. They've shown no slippage, and they're a nice looking addition to the guitar!"
3,Good for class,"Bought this for a class didn't even use it. I did read some of the stories in it on my own, and thought they were interesting. Good book even for just stories."
4,SUPREMELY BLONDIE,"Hi, I read the book and I have learned some stuff I never knew that Flo went through after leaving the Supremes.I think it should have included photos of her parents and siblings.I give it 4 stars because it had some mis information and some of the photos are hard to see.I still recommend this book for the die hard Flo and Supremes fans.Now maybe by the power of god,Flo's story can be made into a movie, cause it has been long enough.Well hopefully not any longer or too long.Pick up this book today, you'll be glad you did for Flo is Heavenly a Supreme Angel."
2,Will someone please write a real biography on flo!!!,"I read this book in 1 night. sorry but it just was'nt enough.It read like a C grade thesis paper for a substandard college english class. I hate giving bad reviews, but really this book was not worth the money..I want to give it back. I found the article on wikipedia relating to Florence Ballard much more interesting..she deserved better."
3,Florence Foerver,This book is an interesting stab at making the lengendary Supreme look less pathetic. The author did a good job in deliverying the facts about Florences exit from the Supremes and her downard spiral in life. But I feel Diana Ross was right when she sated in the 70's that she wanted to just shake Florence and say get your f-ing life together.
4,Forever Faithful gets an update in a new bio on Flo.,"This theisis was a good attempt to cover flo's traumas as an unwilling player in Motown's chief Berry Gordy's game plan, we all know she was denied a chance to shine, and suffered humiliation, and dismissal froma group she helped to name and create, but please take note on the heels of the movie Dreamgirls, someone has finally written a book about florence Ballard, and it was penned by Maxine Ballard, her sister.""the true story of Florence Ballard"" is now out, please get a copyto get the real story from a family member who was there for allof her life. go to [...]."
3,Worst Kim Wilde CD,"I love Kim Wilde but this album curiously falls flat. Except for Backseat Driver and Sparks and 3 versions of Love Blonde which is two too many, album is lackluster. Get the two new 2010 releases Teases and Dares and the other one which are both 2 cd releases and you will experience the greatness of Kim Wilde. Better than most dance pop of today.Great value too."
5,THIS BOOK IS A CONSTANT SOURCE OF INSPIRATIONAL DECORATIN,THIS BOOK WILL GIVE YOU IDEAS FOR THE HOME - YOUR ART- YOUR STYLE OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I RECEIVED THIS AS A GIFT AND IT NOT ONLY MAKES ME REFLECT HAPPILY UPON THE GIFT BUT IT INSTANTLY IMPROVES YOUR MOOD WHEN PERUSING THE PAGES. I AM QUITE CRITICAL ON MOST DECORATING BOOKS AND THIS IS ONE I WOULD CONSIDER A STAPLE IN A DECORATING LIBRARY.
3,obviously for the lace lover,"Bo Niles has beautiful photography but the focus is definitely narrow. There are lots of photos with lace draped everywhere, in rustic settings and more refined settings. If you love beautiful pictures of lace, this is for you. my rating reflects the narrowness of the subject."
2,Misleading Advertising,"Amazon/WholesaleAV advertises the mi6879 by displaying a photo of the mi6879 with an extra handset for a price of $59.56, which is not true. The price quoted is for the mi6879 only. I contacted the company via e-mail and received no response and the ad remains. As far as I am concerned this is false advertising. I will not do business with Amazon or WholesaleAV in the future. Thank you."
3,One of FPM's lesser efforts,"As a huge Fantastic Plastic Machine fan, I was disappointed when ""Too"" was released and turned out to be an almost conventional dance album. FPM's first three albums were so impressive and unique that ""Too"" was a letdown - good enough, but probably FPM's worst album. If the originals aren't great, the remixes are bound to suffer since they almost never best the originals.These remixes are flat and uninspired, thus placing ""Zoo"" at the bottom of the pile. Some of these remix artists are usually pretty decent, but this is not their finest work. I can't recommend this to any but the most die-hard FPM fans."
5,Stellar String Symphonies,"This is the first of a three disc collection of Mendelssohn's youthful and energetic String Symphonies, and they are absolutely the top choice in not only performance and sound but also price. This is music from a charming, melodic, and lyrical young composer at his priceless best. Just listen to the way Volume 1 begins, and I challenge you to find a complete set that rivals these Naxos readings by Ward and the Northern Chamber Orchestra. I believe they truly bring out the Mozartian influence of Mendelssohn laced throughout these early works. There isn't much more to say- I give this cycle my highest recommendation. Snatch them up now while they're still in print: what a find!"
5,The Perfect Thing,"These little symphonies, composed by the barely teenaged Mendelssohn (begun at 12, done at 14!), are the perfect thing for many purposes, including homework, reading or other projects. The tunes are delightful, the playing likewise. This disc has six three movement symphonies, lasting just over an hour. All 62 minutes are delightful."
5,rob thomas little wonders,"the song LITTLE WONDES, is a song for eternity. this song has a true drive and rythm that relaxes the mind as well as touching your heart, thank you ROB THOMAS for a legendary musical gift. Please continue this path."
2,NOT WORTH IT-2,"This anime i did not like it,it was not that fun to watch.Also the speeches about death makes me not like it.It is not that funny to me."
3,Better I Suppose,"While this volume did do a bit better to keep my attention and the twist at the end of the last episode has me curious to see how this series is going to end on the last volume, I really can't say that this series is anything more than just very average. The concept is good. I really like the concept in fact. But I really feel like it was executed quite badly.I am going to reserve final judgment for when I finish the final volume but right now there's really no reason I can think of to tell people that they need to go see this series."
4,"A very good scholastic work, but with a negative slant.","Reading this book was bitter-sweet. Sweet in that there are not that many books on Branham and this book gives an excellent historical account of his ministry. The book is bitter in that, although the end of Branham's ministry was tragic in that he fell into doctrinal error, even the beginning of this prophet's ministry in ""The Healer Prophet..""is portrayed with a skeptical, almost negative twist to it. This is Weaver's Ph.D. dissertation from a traditional, non-charasmatic seminary - which ""may"" account for the sometimes negative tone when the writer describes Branham's use of spiritual gifts. Never-the-less, Weaver's historical account is very good and informative. Even though the book has a few quirks, I still highly recommend this book if you want information on one of God's major prophets that was used powerfully during the Divine Healing movement."
3,Wolf in Sheep's Clothing,The Bible warns us to beware of people bringing false doctrine. WMB was the Great Deceiver of he 20th Century. Fascinating subject matter.
1,Buyer Beware!,"I ordered two of these 45-watt MINI bulbs and instead received two GIANT 150-watt bulbs. I returned them, and the replacement order was the same two incorrect bulbs! In the time I have wasted repeatedly ordering from people who are either illiterate or incompetent I could have easily driven to a hardware store. So much for the convenience of online ordering. Amazon will eventually regret their nonexistent quality control."
2,Product Not as Described--NO STEEL TOE,"I purchased these shoes because I am taking a kiln construction class this semester. The bottom line is that I wanted something to protect my feet from bricks being dropped on them. Rather than go to Wal-Mart and buy a pair of steel toes that screamed ""lumberjack,"" I chose to order these, which I found more stylish and feminine. These arrived today and I will have to send them back. They HAVE NO STEEL TOE as described. I can feel the stiff leather move when I poke it. I am also a little disappointed with the service from Shoebacca. Although the product arrived in a very timely manner (two business days with standard ground shipping), I received no packing sheet, invoice or return instructions in the box with my purchase. I have contacted the seller, and they have agreed to send me return instructions and a return label. The customer service person with whom I dealt was very pleasant and polite."
4,Its.. okay.,"Tenacious D is a great band, but this is by no means one of their better songs. I have no idea why they made it a single, and there is no need to buy it, even if it does have ""Tribute"" on it.Get their self titled album. Its much better, and worth the extra $5-$10. This is decent, but definatly not neccessary."
5,From the romancejournal.com,"...Accidental Rewards is a book that will sit on my book shelf for years to come. And as I age I am sure that I will enjoy rereading it yet again for I will learn something new about friendship. Conny Bryceland does not rely on action and suspense to tell her story.Instead she uses our own human nature, that opposites do attract...and can become the best of friends."" Romance Journal Mar 2001"
2,Couldn't cut it!,"Accidental Rewards is a story that just didn't cut it for me. It started off okay enough, but halfway through the book I just couldn't cut it any more. (I lost interest) The plot was farfetched and boring, and the characters not well-developed, and flat. (Sorry, but this is just one mans's opinion).I will say in all fairness though that I believe in time Ms. Bryceland efforts will improve because she does display a decent dialouge between characters, and even some of the better-known writers (at times) continue to have trouble in that area. Maybe her next book. (I gave the book two stars instead of one because of her effort)."
1,Accidental Review,"""Unrewarding"" should have been the title and only an accident would cause me to buy another book by this author. Stale and overwrought is the only description I can give for other readers. Please save your time and money, don't bother."
3,A tad disappointed,"I purchased this CD as a gift. I'm currently dealing with the supplier for a replacement or refund due to a problem with the CD. I'm sure it'll work out well.UPDATE 10/28/2011THIS REVIEW WAS WRITTEN SOME TIME AGO.... AND I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MAIL FROM THE SUPPLIER INDICATING WHAT HE WILL/WONT DO IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS PURCHASE GOOD. AT THIS POINT, I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT NO ONE PURCHASE FROM THIS SUPPLIER WHO IS IN GERMANY AND WILL NOT EVEN REPLY TO REQUESTS AFTER HE HAS RECEIVED PAYMENT.I TAKE BACK THE 3 STARS RECOMMEND.CHARLIE"
1,THE BALLAD HITS,"BAD DEALING WITH THIS PURCHASE! I AM OLD AND EVIL YOU GAVE ME ABOUT THIS WARNING TO PURCHASE NOT RECEIVED UNTIL TODAY! FINALLY, PAID, AND I HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY REFUND OF AMOUNT PAID! YOU DO NOT BUY WITH NO MORE! Buy a lot and do not respect me AS BUYER, I am outraged!"
4,Not bad for standard equipment blade.,"This is the blade that came with my slide miter saw purchased over five years ago and it is still going strong. I have 3 different blades for my slide miter and this is still the work horse blade. I just recently sent it out for it's first sharpening. I have even managed to cut through a few nails hidden in the wood with little dulling. Granted I get a much smoother cut from the 40 tooth blade, but this works just fine for most contruction grade lumber and even the less than critical household projects."
5,The Star Wars Bible,"I picked up this book yesterday and poured over it for the entire night last night. It's the definative tome for Star Wars fans. I showed the book to some friends and their all picking up copies. It was expensive in Canada $210, but well worth it. If you want text, then pick up the Star Wars encyclopedia. But if you want the most attractive coffee table book ever, then this is the book for you."
1,A hundred dollars? Gimme a break!,Any of you people planning to spend a hundred dollars on a book like this should grow up and get a real life.
2,Anti-Climactic purchase,"I've always been a mega-collector of everything Star Wars, especially any books on the behind-the-scenes stuff. Well, to cut to the chase, it might be best to not bother. Yes, this book is big, heavy, and pricey. Yes, this book will arrive beaten up. Yes, the binding will be apt to crack. And in the end, all you're going to get are slightly different angles of pics you've seen before. The information is pretty sparse; it's mostly a picture book. Needless to say, with Google image search, it doesn't make much sense to fork out the dough to have a clunky book of images available for viewing for free!If you're a Star Wars fanatic, I wouldn't bother; you already know all of this."
4,Superb photo history but lacking in dialogue strength,"... What it lacks in reading material it more than makes up for in photographs. The detail shown makes you appreciate even more, if it were possible, the skill that went into the model making. I spent many happy hours admiring the finite details that this book highlights brilliantly. Also the opportunity to see prototype models as well is more than welcome, giving an insight to the creative process. Overall, I would say that this is an essential purchase for SW fans. But, until we get a book that combines both in depth narrative AND crisp photographs then the ultimate Star Wars book is still waiting to be written.Oh, and it's size and weight makes it murder to read in bed!!"
2,Not OEM compatible,Be careful buying this dock. Apple's inserts for ipods of different sizes don't fit this dock.
2,Not compatible with Apple's remote,"Be aware, the remote purchased from Apple is not compatible with this dock."
1,Phone plug doesn't latch,"The concept behind the phone cord detangler is excellent. But the plug end that gets inserted into the handset does not latch so it keeps falling out. While that does enable the cord to become detangled, not in the way the product is designed to work. DO NOT buy this product unless the manufacturer fixes this problem."
1,Cheap Piece of Junk,"Used this on my phone and it worked for about two weeks before my phone started cutting out and people couldn't hear me. The cheap internal wiring had broken down and the thing was useless. Regrettably, this is one of the many areas where it looks like you get what you pay for. Spend the money on one of these made by a reputable manufacturer, so you don't end up having to purchase it twice."
1,Beware: doesn't fit all phones,I bought this for my Panasonic phone. The Twisstop does not fit into the phone. The hole is slightly recessed and will not go in all the way.
1,Doesn't Work,"The unit does not work with the headset! The plug does not stay in the receiver and because of the design, the receiver does not fit into the cradle when not in use. DON'T BOTHER BUYING!"
2,slips out of the handset,"About 3 times a day, the device will pull out of my handset while I'm talking on the phone. It really should fit tighter into the plug. I usually end up putting my call on speakerphone so that I don't loose the person on the other end of the line. Otherwise, when it stays in the handset, it works fine to keep the kinks out of the cord."
1,"""does not affect sound- I beg to differ!""","The products works great- for about a week, then caller's voices start cutting out, all due to the detangler. I know it is an issue with the item itself, as the static and voice problems DO NOT occur until you plug in the detangler. I have purchased 5 of the same model, all of them work the same (great) until repeated de-tangling causes the voice issues.Plus, at $5 each, the quality does not match the price; and won't, until the manufacturer fixes the defects.If there is a better product out there, I would love to hear about it!"
1,not what expected,"not sure what type of phone this is supposed to keep untangled, but i bought it for my office phone and my cord is staying just as tangled as ever."
1,useless,"bought 3 pieces too big to fit in handset panasonic phone brand , useless itemit is made in Taiwan and not USA as mentioned on company's site.should not get any star"
1,Incompatible with some phones,"This product may work well for phones with which it is compatible; however, it is incompatible with our office phones and I believe it will be incompatible with a good number phones. The problem is that the plug is too short, as short as it possibly can be. The wide twisty part, which sits directly behind the plug, causes the problem...the shortness of the plug results in a plug that cannot be inserted deeply enough into some handsets for it to lock in place. Our office phones are the Cisco IP Phone 7945, and this device does not lock into place at all. It also doesn't lock into place on the back of the phone for exactly the same reason, making it useless for this phone. MOST of the other designs for competing products, if not all of them, have a longer plug, which gives them a fighting chance of being compatible with more phones. I do not recommend trying this product unless you verify that your handset only requires a shallow plug."
1,Horrible piece of equipment,Do not buy! This item quit working within a year of purchase or my users would often complain about a loud crackling noises while talking on the phone.
3,Great artwork.,"This book isn't what I thought it would be. I seriously doubt I will do more than look at the pictures, as it is a huge undertaking on my limited time."
2,Yawn material and glassy eyed harvests.,"The delicate, marvelously controlled voice of English soprano Sophie Daneman is the chief justification for this CD. The songs themselves are over refined, pink tea creations that are almost parodies of the curse of salon boredom. The contents of the entire CD can't match the unaffected quality of one song by Stephen Foster (!!!!) --- much less songs composed by the giants of lieder composition in Germany and Austria in the 19th century. How five CD volumes of these demi tasse and petite fois twirls came to be produced beggars the imagination. There must've been stampedes to the rose arbors and billiard rooms when 1840s hostesses announced these songs were on offer in the salon."
4,Daughter loved it,"My daughter received this book when she was 4 years old and she was enchanted by the magic in it. The colors are beautiful and the pouch for her tooth, that comes with it, is an extra treat. As with Santa Claus, she will eventually learn that it is all make-believe but until then, it has been fun for her to imagine this to be the story of the tooth fairy."
1,Disappointing story.,Tells the story of why children get two sets of teeth. Focused on dentistry. Not very entertaining. Have concerns about the cauldron scene possibly promoting cult rites. I do not recommend this book to parents.
1,Terrible,"This is a terrible book, and publishers should think twice before trying to cheat computer professionals with this kind of junk. The book has two parts. The first 68 pages are a rambling, poorly-written description of SNMP. Acronyms and concepts are often introduced before they are defined (if ever), and the author is way too keen on buzzwords. The second part, 210 pages, is just a COPY of the MIB documentation that anybody can download from the Internet. This part also includes event thresholds for each object, but they are completely arbitrary and uninteresting. Finally, the price is ridiculous."
3,intoxicating,"I bought this product a few years back at a nearby sephora. They have since stopped carrying the product, so i decided too order out online. Sadly, i'm not too good with sizes and ounces.the size i bought was 1fl. Oz. i paid 35 dollars for this product..at the sephora, i paid 19, for the same size bottle.i felt like i over paid, but it smells amazing, so i quickly got over it!!"
5,Absolutely love it!!!,"This perfume is one that I can wear even though I suffer from migraines--Cacharel perfumes seem to be about the only ones that do not trigger my migraines and this perfume is a little stronger than their other perfumes but it is wonderful. Both my students that I work with , as well as my significant other find this scent very nice. I have had people stop me and ask what I was wearing--even though it isnt a very strong smell. I get lots of compliments on the scent and it seems to last without becoming cloying. The only problem I have is that none of the stores here carry this perfume anymore!!! Absolutely love it!!!"
2,ugh,"I'm only giving a low grade because it took over a month for my order . when I called, it was explained that the shipper had llost my package. really? after a month, it took me being upset for anyone to notice? what if I hadn't called? All the money would've been unrequited? thanks guys."
1,I am not satisfied,"I'm not satisfied about my purchase because I never got the perfum. I'm a frecuent buyer from Venezuela. Usually I order the items and I receive them in a PO box in Miami. But this time, although I received the DELIVERED notification, I didn't received this perfum. I contacted the seller and they just told me to contact Mail Boxes. They say there is not perfum in the PO box and that it never arrived their offices. I filled the claim in amazon.com and later I received an e-mail by them saying they couldn't do anything else, and my case was closed..Sadly I don't see amazon as reliable as I used to..."
3,I love this scent. The bottle and packaging is not appealing.,The scent of this product is very nice and not overpowering. It's slight and lasts all day. The only problem with this product is it is in a very ugly bottle and the packaging matches. The colors and materials used give it a cheap feel. I actually put the perfume itself in another bottle that is more appealing. But the scent is very nice. Their is a definite disconnect between product and packaging here.
3,Good and bad,This perfume is great! I love the smell and was glad I found it here because I can't seem to find it in any stores in the US. I was not so happy with the fact that when I got it the bottle was leaking a little. Now I have to carry the bottle around in 2 ziploc bags or it would spill. Awesome perfume though!
3,Won't last long,"I liked the smell of this in the store and was very excited to go from BoraBora to a new scent. Well...I can put this on when I start my make-up and by the time I'm done (20 min. max) I need to do it again. The smell is warm and sweet but who will know it unless they stand next to me while I'm spraying it?I consider this fragrance a waste of money...very expensive for a few moments of joy. I've used up almost the whole bottle and will never buy this one again. It could be that it just does not work with my chemistry, but here's a note to rethink your choice."
2,Disappointing,"Very disappointing. I had heard nothing but positives about the band. I also thought the song selection was good. However, I didn't care for the vocals at all. The lead singer's voice is extremely unpleasant. Songs like Blue Night & Blue Ridge Mountain Home were unbearable. Just not my cup of tea."
1,Serious packaging problems,I purchased and received this item a couple of weeks ago. The internal packaging was very light and the clamp had a dent on one side. I returned it for replacement. The replacement arrived without any internal packaging. The clamp was moving freely inside the box and had fallen into pieces. Yesterday I returned it again this time for reimbursement. My one star rating is due exclusively to the packaging because I did not have the chance to use the clamp. I have been purchasing a wide variety of items from Amazon over a good number of years. This is the first time that I have a problem like this.
1,poor,"It was suppose to be clamp and cut!!! but, it has a poor design and is nowhere near doing the job right. I returned it.Gator Clamps 410-50 50-Inch Clamp N Cut Multi-Purpose Woodworking Tool"
3,The original,"For all you ""Musicians"" out there who argue that Cannibal and the headhunters originated ""Land of a thousand dances"" Get this CD, and listen to the man who penned it."
4,Chris Kenner (I like it like that),"Even though this song was re-done by The Dave Clark Five, it's original version is the best. there are few other songs that's worth listening to, also."
4,Beautiful,"A couple years ago,I and my family visited Yellowstone National Park.But it was in summer.So,I want to buy this Blu-ray disc.As a result,these images on Blu-ray disc are excellent and beautiful. I want to visit there again someday."
2,Too little about the parks,"A lot of coverage of people at the parks, and too little about the natural wonders of the parks themselves. Not at all what I expected."
2,Muder By Phone,"Alright...'Murder By Phone'. It was an okay movie. I definitely think it could've been a lot better. It's one of those cheesy 80s horror flicks. I found it more funny than scary, though I admit, I'm gonna be scared to answer the phone for a while! This movie is pretty much about a crazed murderer dude who kills his victims by calling them + then playing a high frequency sound which makes them have like convulsions + then he sends high voltage through the phone + they die. This movie is also a little confusing at times. (Keep in mind, I saw the movie at like midnight) This is DEFINITELY a REALLY good movie to watch with a bunch of your friends during a sleepover in the middle of the night!"
3,"Good performance, weak recording engineer.","Thiollier performs well on this effort. The piano sounds distant and muddy, however. The selections are all tremendous pieces of music. Too bad the recording effort doen't keep pace. Try Jacques Loussier Trio's rendition of this music. It's a touch jazzy and marvellously produced."
4,Hitachi 8-1/2 slide compond miter,"Nice, tough, lightweight,accurate slidearm. I have used various models, brands, and sizes in the past 15 years of doing trim work. 5 years ago I learned big isn't always better. I feel this is about the best miter bx on the market today for trim work."
4,Pretty Good Saw--Mine Lasted about 8 Years,"Flawless saw. Mine saw 8 years of tough duty before it crapped out, but was deadly accurate for about 7 of its 8 years."
2,review of saw,"The saw is a good saw but is very limited. It only bevels in one direction and it cannot cut most trim standing upright. If there is any way i could return it for another saw, mabey even an upgrade i would really appreciate it."
2,Not the best saw I ever owned,"I owned this saw for 1 year, when the wires shorted out and caught fire in a brand new house I was working in. I went and bought a 12"" DeWalt slider and never regreted it. The Hatachi has too small of a fence, you can't cut crown mold standing up, you can't cut tall base broads standing up. The cut depth is also too small the tallest you can cut 4"". I do not recommend this tool!"
2,DESIGN FLAWS,"I've waited about six months before I wrote this review and I've put the saw through some work. The adage ""you get what pay for"" is remarkably true for this product. I purchased this at when Hitachi had a special for under three hundred. I also got a router. At the time I thought it was a good deal. Now I realize this will not be my final shop mitre saw. That says alot doesn't it.The problem-this saw cannot cut a 4x4 without flipping. Without modification this saw cannot cut a 4x4 at all. In order to cut a 4x4 I had to permanantly take off the blade guard and bend the blade guard holder back(it is held to the body of the saw by a small easily stripped phillips screw. If this saw could cut a 4x4 in one pass I would give it five stars because in others respects it really is solid."
1,No Romance,"I generally like Rachel Lee's suspense-romance stories. This one, however, was sadly lacking in romance. There was hardly any interaction between the main characters. They never developed a relationship. The mystery was good but there was no time spent developing a love story between the cop and the suspect. I was very disappointed."
3,Pretty good but not great.,"Cushioning is about what you would expect from about 3/4 inch of gel. Doesn't breathe at all, though. I guess it's worth the money, but I almost wish I had bought a memory foam cushion."
1,Waste of money.,"I bought one of these as a Christmas present for my husband to use in the car. It proved to be ineffective and failed to relieve his discomfort driving long distances. Now, alittle over a year later, it has a hole worn in the center. I will not be buying this product again."
2,Not a very effective product,"Not very well made nor designed. One side has a very flimsy cover which you can see the grey foam rubber waffle pattern through. This is the side you sit on, because the other side is a weave of grippy rubbery stuff that holds the cushion in place. Sitting on the waffle grille side is not very smooth -- I can find no evidence of any ""gel"" utilized in this product at all -- it is merely an open gridwork of pretty soft rubber with a flimsy cover. It is easy enough to compress the grillework between your fingers, so sitting on it flattens it out pretty quickly. Look at the picture with the cover peeled back -- that's all there is to it. It's really not a premium product and is certainly not worth the $60 Amazon advertises it for by another supplier. With shipping, this item came to over $40, and it's just not worth it in my opinion."
5,Seat Cushion Works for me without becoming flat,I started noticing extreme pain in my lower back and could not figure out the cause. We finally determined it was from sitting in a high back executive chair all day (6-8 hours per day). Tried foam cushion but it kept going flat after a few hours (I weigh 230 pounds). So I wanted a cushion that would not go flat on me. Bought this gel cushion and all is fine now. Would buy again and in fact I did buy an extra after buying this one.
3,Not much content,I got this for my dad who served in the Aleutians. It is a 60s style video newsreel that has a little bit of interesting footage but is very old and dated in its presentation. A novelty for anyone sho spent time there during or after the war.
5,Easy yet profound read,Wattles does a great job of reminding us of the heart of God for ALL people. This book is a must read for everybody.
2,Oh Well....,"Although a great fan of the series, I am in agreement with otherreviews as to the compression, and the packaging (yes,read the warning about roving discs during transport, yes they roved!).I still am at a loss to understand the reasoning behind the pilot episode incorporated in season 3, and am not overjoyedwith double sided discs...maybe in the future....?Regardless(although it does detract somewhat),I am still a loyalDue South addict, but will be less likely to part with the cashfor a package that appears to have had no thought put into itspresentation and packaging.Ta."
1,Complex plot? There IS no plot.,"Now now now, let's not get carried away. Sure it is popular in our current culture to find a liking in obscure things. But don't give praise or attempt to over-analyze a movie that is bluntly one of the most horrible films ever made. This movie isn't entertaining, interesting, or even all that obscure. The plot finds itself spinning in circles, almost as if they wrote this as they went along. If you like low-budget plotless films with poor acting, buy this movie."
1,Awful,"The acting is okay, the photography is okay, but the screenplay is truly awful. The story makes no sense. Whoever wrote this piece of garbage needs to make a career change."
3,It's all shrouded in mystery!,This was a fun little horror movie. It keeps you guessing and the ending is open to interpretation. If you've been following all along it's not a surprise. Seth Green is always a treat!
1,Dull and boring,"One of the worst I've seen... I'm trying to figure out which audience this was made for: a lot of nudity, a dumb story, bad acting, characters you don't care about, bad premise, bad direction, etc."
1,STATIC ATTIC,"When a movie fails to make sense by the time you've finished watching it, it has lost its purpose--to entertain. Despite all the glorified ""indie"" trappings, the movie is so muddled and artistically overblown that it's a waste of time. Good acting from Andreas Jones, Seth Green and Wendy Robie. But overall a disappointing waste of time."
1,Don't bother,"Like the previous writer, I, too, have been waiting to see this movie. Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations. I did, however, enjoy the sets and the exterior scenes. Very surreal and spooky. Beyond that, though, the movie was maddening. The script was plodding and confusing, the dialogue lame and stilted. The plot did not make sense, (and I enjoyed and understood movies such as Memento). It actually became so frustrating to follow that the movie became boring. Character devlopment was nil. With the exception of the first five minutes of the movie, it was a waste of a precious two hours of my life."
2,Confused and Mental,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The only good acting in the entire movie was Seth Green, who was really good. The other actors were stiff and who could blame them. The dialogue was unreal. I mean NO ONE talks like that! The plot was ridiculously thin and confusing. The director tried for deep and meaningful with funky shots and sequences but never made it. There was never a resolution to any question brought up in the film. Why was this happening to the lead character? I don't know. Why was he trying to perform this ceremony? I don't know. How did it go wrong? I don't know. What was the point to anything? I don't know? What happened to him or his nemesis at the end of the film? I don't know! I was bored silly by the movie and I really wanted to like it."
3,weird but also interesting,its sorta weird but cool and Green like you've never seen him before. You have to see it to beleive it
2,umm no no no no no,"was looking forward to seeing this movie like everyone else. love re-animator. and saw that jeffrey combs was going to play a crazy doctor in this movie too so figured it would have to be good but was shocked how wrong i was. this movie takes forever to get going. boring and confusing are not a good mix for a movie. don't think it would matter if you watched this film two or three times, still don't think you could figure out what's going on. only problem is that you wouldn't want to watch it that many times as it is extremely and unentertaining. will just have to wait for the next re-animator sequeal to see somethin good from jeffrey combs i suppose. pass this one up unless a die hard combs fan."
3,Not completely Pleased,The book was carelessly placed in the package. The cover was bent in half. It was brand new and bent. The reason I bought it new was so it would be in perfect condition. Guess I shouldn't have spent the extra money.
3,what happened?!!!!!!!!!,holy cow! what happend? the game play is just average mega man battle network games are supposed to be good! fun game play zenny's and took out add! the game is not very good number 2 was awesome 3 took a little dive not as fun but great 4 took a huge dive and chewed by a shark in the acid pool! if you're like me love almost every gba game so it's a risk buy it if you want but it's lame
5,"Great game,and funny glitches","I think this is the best game ever!(Out of the four others) It's got different storylines each time you play it,it's got the new soul unison thing(Guts,Roll,Search,Thunder,Wind,and Fire),and they have better chips and NEW viruses!The glitches in the game may be irritating to some people though. Unless you have a good sense of humor then you'll laugh at most of them. I know I did!"
4,This is gonna be a great game,"MegaMan Battle Network 4 was designed to follow the Battle Network Series starring Lan Hikari and his netnavi, the Blue Bomber himself, MegaMan. This story involves MANY battles and mini missions to complete their task. The whole object of this game or the biggest mission is to save the earth once again from a giant asteroid. To complete this task Lan and MegaMan must combine battle chips with strategy to beat enemy Net Navis and in all save the world. I am going to buy this game and I suggest if you are a MegaMan fan, to buy one too. Even if you are a newcomer, you will find the storyline easy to follow and will soon find yourself caught up in the MegaMan craze!*****Bad Parts- no style changes(heat guts, aqua shield.etc.) And you run into viruses about every 15 steps!*****"
4,Perfect!!!!!!!!!,If your a starter like i am you would be playing this game every second. Better graphics and more chips make this game better. It is a good game every mega man fan would love it unless you want to go classic and retro. This game is more better for the starter and the person who just wants to play. But if you are a serious mastermind behind the game then go for blue moon ( you left all alone ) sorry got off track with the song. Both games are great you will never see a dull moment with this game! see you later my fellow readers.
2,Athletic virtuosity but choroegraphically disappointing,"Unfamiliar with the group, I had hoped this would represent modern dance with tinges of Brazilian Samba. I found its roots to be more in the European (ballet) tradition than they were Brazilian. Dancers were at the peak of fitness, tireless and exhibited amazing technical prowess but the redundancy of the choreography with unrelentingly tedious rhythms and flat dynamics left me bored and $26 poorer."
5,Video compliment to the book,"I first read The Night of the Grizzlies when it first came out many years ago... shortly after the tragedy being visited. I have made several trips to Montana and always visit Glacier National Park while there. The story was of special interest to me, as I have been to some of the places in the story and am interested in backcountry hiking and camping. I recently hunted down a copy of the original book and, in doing so, found out that there was this documentary that had been released only a year or two ago, revisiting the tragedy that had taken place over 30 years ago. The video is a documentary, so it is more informative than dramatic, but would still be worth watching for anyone interested in Glacier Park, grizzly bears, or probably the most famous night of grizzly activity recorded."
4,Glacier Parks Night of the Grizzlies,"Thought it was a movie when I bought it, but it was a documentary. Even though we expected a movie and got a documentary, we were still pleased with it. It was still very good and will be a ""keeper"" in our collection. We visit Glacier National Park every year and I learned about the movie by reading books on Glacier National Park. ""Fate is a Mountain"" is a great book to read as well as ""It happened in Glacier National Park"". Get them, you'll love them too!!"
2,No notes?,"This is one of Amazon's CD-R, on-demand, offerings. The Amazon blurb says this is equal to the original Naxos release, and has the same 'art work.' What Amazon doesn't say is whether you get the same notes as the original. A friend ordered one of these Spohr discs and got no notes - and no response from Amazon when he inquired. If notes are an issue for you, beware!"
5,"Susan kills it, as usual","Sontag, as ever, manages to craft writings of remarkable intellectual range and depth on pretty much anything she focuses. Under the Sign of Saturn feels a bit darker than some of her other books I've read, in so far is a lot of the essays focus on (both directly and implicity) fascism and its broad appeal and continued resonance in the arts and culture of the post-war era. I think the best thing I can say about these is that even when you have no exposure to the works of people she writes about (I for one don't know the first thing about Antonin Artaud Elias Canetti or Hans Syberberg) she still manages to spin out so many dazzlingly smart observations that they are absolutely worth your time. Sontag makes you passionate about everything she's passionate about. And there seems to be very little that she isn't passionate about"
1,Book is Completely Unreadable,This book was written in 1905 and then in 2009 someone used an OCR to scan the pages of the book. So much of the book is gibberish because the scanner could not or did not copy the original text correctly. To say that I am disappointed is an understatement.
3,Conviction and Sensitivity,"GERSHWIN IN BLACK AND WHITE (Centaur CRC 2174) yields some fascinatingly 'inauthentic' Gershwin. Acting on his own frustration that the composer left no full-scale works for solo piano, pianist Haskell Small has made his own solo-piano 'transcription' (read: version) of the CONCERTO IN F and adapted William Daly's transcription of AN AMERICAN IN PARIS. Both his versions and his performances ring with conviction and warrant the places they're sure to assume in solo pianists' repertoires. The CD includes a sensitive performance of LULLABY in Alicia Zizzo's arrangement, whose public premiere Small played at New York's Town Hall on April 10, 1992.- Piano and Keyboard Magazine"
3,"Not her best album, but certainly a must for fans","Acid Queen was Tina Turner's second solo album. Better than her first solo album, which is still not available on Cd ( come on EMI !!!). Especially her version of Whole lotta love is terrific ! Not her best solo work, but certainly worth its money !"
2,Solo album #2,"This is Tina's second solo attempt, recorded in 1975 when she was still under the violent hand of her ex-husband Ike Turner. The album has some chunks of rock, but as the CD inches toward the duet with Ike on ""Baby, Get It On"" we see a drastic change in the material of the CD. Tracks 6-9 were written and mostly produced by Ike. Instead of the classic rock songs, Tina begins to sing about men, love, and delves back into her Black R&B roots, which isn't a really bad thing. It just doesn't fit in with the mold of this album. Although tracks 10-12 are just thrown on the album to fill space, we receive some good, original chunks of the down home soul of the Tina Turner when she was still sweatin' it out on the Chitlin' Circuit with Ike, the long wigs, the Ikettes, and the Revue. Good solo try Tina!!"
3,You have to hear Bootsy Whitelaw,"I haven't even heard this album and I'm not a huge Tina fan, at least not a fan of the power-ballad version of Tina, but I love the old stuff. I got the song Bootsy Whitelaw as a free download from MP3.com and didn't know, until recently, where it came from, but it's fantastic. It's raw and funky and funny but the production is on a par with the stuff she re-recorded for the ""What's Love..."" soundtrack. I don't know whether Ike produced it or is playing on it or what, but it sounds great and timeless and super-funky. Since other people are recommending other songs from this album, then it must be worth owning."
5,"Ah, a breath of fresh air and relaxation.","I absolutely adore this album. I just recently fell in love with Debussy, so I'm sure one can imagine my delight stumbling upon Mr. Thiollier - the artist who's recorded the most of Debussy's work that I can find in digital downloads. I listen to it in the car on long drives (you wouldn't believe how much it serves to preserve the lives of insolent drivers I might encounter), cooking dinner with my family, and, my favorite, while reading a good book. Though the recordings aren't the best (give it some credit, the album is just three years younger than I am), the musical quality and the fervor with which Mr. Thiollier attacks the more lively and delightfully hectic pieces, coupled with the delicate and hauntingly beautiful lingering notes of Clair de Lune, for example, prove that this album is definitely worth both a place in my growing classical collection and the measly price I paid for it. In fact, I'm off to get Volume 2 as I finish typing!"
1,This Book Stunk,This book stunk. Their are no victims with lupus - especially in this book. There is the wife who is a survivor and then there is the husband - uneducated and self centered when it comes to lupus.Carole
1,"""made in Taiwan to Jet's specifications""","Both sets of these that I've received have been dull and chipped up. The square chisels were okay but the bits looked like someone tried to go through hardened steel with them.Everything appeared to be packed very safely with the chisels all individually wrapped, so it would seem that bits were put in the box dull to begin with. Or improperly manufactured.For this price, I would expect much better quality control. This is a major disappointment and these will have to be returned."
3,OK. but...,"Bits are heavy duty and should work fine in the long run. But they are not ""shop"" ready when they come out of the box. Drill bit faces are poorly machined and have many residual burrs that need to be knocked off before use. You would think that JET would have better QC than this...not up to typical JET standards."
2,"""An Ephemeral Tale""","If you are looking for drama, excitement or suspense, this movie will prove very disappointing. In fact, the bulk of the film deals with a group of endearing and quirky characters having a grand old time at a 1904 Dublin dinner party, where sentimentality, drinking, poetry readings and maudlin ballads prevail. In one brief moment, a couple engages in a sad pensive conversation. And that's really not enough to carry this film."
5,Haunting story of the conflict between reality and perception,"This movie is very gentle and subtle. It builds throughout film, like James Joyce's great short story it is based upon, to a very dramatic climax. There is a reason that the story takes place on the Feast of the Epiphany. The revalation we are witness to at the end is beautiful. Wonderfully acted, beautiful cinematography. One of my favorite short stories and this adaption to film is very well done. I will always remember the closing scene with the snow falling on Ireland."
1,The Dead: John Huston rolls over in his grave.,What an insult to one of the greatest American directors. Who decided to cut eight minutes from this film? Why? What does the Huston family have to say about this. Don't buy this DVD!
1,Send a message to Lionsgate: do not purchase this edition,It's getting a release...but not a proper release. More than 8 minutes have been cut from the beginning of the film (according to dvdverdict). This isn't the result of region conversion. They were cut. No explanation. Please send a message to the hacks at Lionsgate and refrain from purchasing this travesty. What a great film being so sorely treated. You would think the idiotic cover art would be sufficient insult to Huston's final masterpiece.
1,Lionsgate disgraceful attitude,"Lionsgate has cut at least 8 minutes from the film. Probably this is a TV version, shorter to fill in a 90 minutes slot! When i first heard about this release i was excited, then appalled from the ugly cover and now simply disgusted...DO NOT BUY THIS, LIONSGATE RECALL THE DVD NOW AND FIX THE PROBLEM!!!EDIT: The fixed version is available from other retailers, Amazon why aren't you carrying it?"
1,Lionsgate has lousy customer service,"The NYTimes reported that Lionsgate was reissuing this marvelous movie with the missing 10+ minutes cut for no reason and gave a telephone/e-mail contact to receive an un botched copy. Two months and multiple attempts to contact them later, I am left with the expurgated version.Jane"
1,Warning: This Is a Butchered Version,"WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. This is NOT the same version as the U.S. theatrical release. Worse, there is NO warning on the package that this DVD version is different than the one released to theaters. The morons at LionsGate have inexplicably cut about 10 minutes from the film. Those missing 10 minutes help develop the character of protagonist Gabriel Conroy, and show small details about his relationship with his wife -- which is the whole damn point of the story! Those 10 missing minutes also reveal the drinking problem of Freddy Malin, over which the hostesses of the party are fretting in the opening scenes. Without those 10 minutes, the fretting of the hostesses over Freddy's drinking make no sense. This was a masterpiece of moviemaking, but the jackasses at LionsGate are so stupid, they have no idea how they have ruined this movie by releasing a butchered DVD. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!"
1,"Lions Gate Butchered ""The Dead""","John Huston's adaptation of The Dead (screenplay by son Tony Huston) is a breathtaking success. The day Lionsgate announced their release of the film in its correct 1.85 ratio I pre-ordered twelve copies, eleven to be given to friends. Regrettably, all twelve discs will be returned to Amazon because Lionsgate arbitrarily deleted 10 minutes of footage from The Dead's first act. What the hill did they expect to gain by condensing a masterpiece with an original running time of just 83 minutes? Idiots.This is not Amazon's crime. Returning these discs is an action I wish weren't necessary."
3,Slow movie with a perfect ending.,"The last scene of ""The Dead"" includes a voice over by Donal McCann and just may be one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen. In retrospect it was the perfect way for John Huston to finish his long career. But before this scene, I found the movie challenging to sit through. The acting was superb but much like Huston's ""Under the Volcano"", the story seemed to meander along at a slow pace and and I lost my interest, hoping something would happen soon. My patience was rewarded in the last scene, but I think the movie would have been better as a short feature film (featurette) of perhaps 45 minutes. As it is, I can't give it more than 3 stars, but I'm still glad I saw it, and it should be on DVD.Update: the movie is available on a PAL region 2 DVD in the UK. It's for sale at amazon.co.uk"
1,The Dead,"The most beautiful film ever. It captured the spirit of Joyce's short story, enhancing it with the new additions - Mr. Grace's recitation of ""Broken Vows"", the camera travelling through the Misses Morkans' house showing aspects of everyday life (portraits, a bible and a rosary, trinkets on the bedside tables, embroideries with religious sayings, etc.), traditional Irish songs being played all the time, and many other aspects."
1,Boring,"This moves at a glacial pace with the unmistakable feel of made-for-tv. For some different Christmas movies try The Bishop's Wife, Come to the Stable or Christmas in Connecticut."
3,A little slow,"This film is based on the great James Joyce short story of the same title. The story is full of tension based on the difference between what Gabriel, the protagonist, perceives, and what really seems to be happening. The film, however, loses that point of view, and can't find other tensions to keep the film going. It's not a bad film, but if you want to see a great John Houston adaptation check out Treasure of the Sierra Madre."
1,I GOT SUCKERED!,"I am gravely upset. I bought this before I checked the reviews and immediately noticed the eight minute cut. The entire opening of this film is structured so it takes place in real time, or ""time for time,"" as they say. Cutting this film constitutes a major violation of a work of art! DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION!"
1,If you have a multi-region player-----,"I share the outrage expressed by those ranting against the inexplicable deletion of the first 10 minutes of this long-awaited release of John Huston's masterpiece, ""The Dead"". Yes, indeed, what were they thinking? And what is Lionsgate going to do about it? I ordered the DVD a few days ago before knowing about the cuts and plan to return it as soon as it arrives. In the meantime, Amazon UK offers a 83 minute version of the film, 10 minutes longer than the U.S. version, so one hopes and assumes that it is intact.Of course you need a DVD player that will play all regions. I purchased one from OPPO a few years ago and it has performed brilliantly and I believe it is still available at a very competitive price. It is a godsend for those looking for hard-to-find classics that are simply unavailable in the U.S."
5,The Dead,"Excellent quality DVD. The story is just so moving there are two pieces within that are so wonderful, the recital and the tenor's rendition - Wow. The actors, casting, so well done, a masterpiece for sure."
5,The best James Joyce movie,John Huston's last film is proof that a movie need not be big to be excellent. He has captured the tone and flavor of James Joyce's novella perfectly. The acting fits every quality of the original.
2,disappointed in shabby release,"I have been waiting for the proper release of this wonderful film for too many years;patiently awaiting a DVD release worthy of its artistry and historical significance.I am afraid I will have to cancel my plans to order this upon hearing that it has been cut from its original length.John Huston was one of our great American FIlm Directors , and this film is his crowning achievement.I will not accept a butchered release to corrupt my wonderful memories of this film.Please hope that Criterion is able to release this beautiful film someday - I will be first in line when it is releasedin a length and a quality print worthy of its stature."
5,Great Knitting Book,"The sweaters are beautiful. I just got the book, and I immediately had to order yarn for two sweaters plus the accessories, which is not typical of me at all. Usually I peruse knitting books for a while and eventually something might grab me enough that I actually knit it. I have already knitted the hood to Vigdis and have started on the actual sweater. Ragna is next, and I'm forcing myself to hold back and knit Vigdis before starting on Ragna also.Don't be intimidated by the new techniques - they aren't hard, and they make sense. I am an experienced knitter, and if you have never knitted before I would still recommend starting with something more basic, but if you like these designs you will be able to knit them. If you are looking for a challenge, that is here too - particularly the challenge to be inspired by the technique and use it in your own way. Expect to learn something new, but you will find all the encouragement that you need."
2,Sigh,"I've been knitting for 30 years. I've created Aran knit sweaters, I design and knit ornately cabled kilt hose. I make socks--fancy fancy socks. I also do lace work. I can't pull off a single thing in this book. Had this book for years, very nice looking pictures, but the instructions are a confusing mess that I have not been able to decipher yet. If you have gobs of patience, maybe this book is for you."
3,you can't judge a book by it's cover!,"It is a very . beautifulbook and I will endure to knit several other things from it at some time. However, the tunic I knitted was slightly off and I had to add a stitch to the cable pattern to work it out and it's the first thing I've spent over a year knitting (oh the slowness of my knitting needles) and I absolutely detested it. IT'S STILL A LOVELY BOOK THOUGH!"
3,Viking Patterns for Knitting: Inspiration and Projects,The patterns and directions were not what I expected. It will be difficult to make items from these pattern because of the instructions and the presentation.
5,New Fan!,This is my first look at the author's knitting patterns. I had always been intimidated by cables but now I am so inspired by her lovely designs and simple explanations; I have already purchased another of her books.
2,Poor sound quality,"CD has a gritty sound quality, its not clear. Taped from live speeches you do hear a lot of the crowd. You can still understand what X is saying."
5,Pay attention to the vereion,"Beware the digitally remastered verion with the light blue cover has great video but is dubbed as opposed to cantonese or mandarin. I had to buy a different version because I cant stand ancient chinese people speaking in high pitched english. I bought the shalin temple dvd with three movies shaolin temple , shaolin temple 2, and born to defense. This had pretty good video but the original language as an option. It has English too if you really want it. The subtitles seemed good to me. As a movie shaolin temple was good lots of martial art action. I guess all i said was wrong because *****i just figured out how to get alternate languages. I had to use the audio button on the remote and i got chinese language"
1,Shaolin Temple fails,"This film failed to deliver the kung-fu experience that I was so desperately hoping to achieve from an early 80's film. The plot sucked, the fighting was slow and sloppy (no technique). Do not buy this!"
2,this dvd was fair but a little disappointing,As I watched this dvd I was expecting and hoping for something more. It was mostly children doing workouts and I was expecting real monks. They were good but I actually thought this was a documentary on the monks at shaolin going through their daily routines and it wasn't. My mistake really. I cannot remember the exact title which I saw many years ago at a friends house. It was interesting to see Jet Li performing fantastically even at a young age indicating his skill was a gift really. Oh well.
1,Horrible transfer,"This DVD has a horrible pan and scan transfer which ruins most of the scenes in the movie. In particular, any involving what look to be excellent martial arts, but also many scenes that simply include than one person. There are the usual discrepencies between the dubbed and subtitled english translations. I have seen worse, so they're only mildly annoying. The images are often blurry and have lots of noise, as if from a bad original. I can't even recommend this on VHS. It's a pity that Jet Li's first movie couldn't have had a better transfer. I was very disappointed, and I consider myself a fan of the genre and Jet Li."
1,EAT DOGS,I do not like the part where people eat dogs. So it getes one star. How can you eat a dog? Are you ..... ???
1,Don't believe the hype,"I'm a Jet Li fan, and own a couple of his films...but I wouldn't recommend this DVD to anyone. It was a big waste of [money]!! If you must see this movie...rent it or borrow it, but don't buy!! I should have listened to the other ""one star"" reviewer who described the horrible pan and scan quality of this DVD. I must admit that there are a few moments of interest in the movie...one can't deny the skill involved when viewing the individuals display their use of weapons. But the story is bad, the acting is bad, the camera work is bad, the sound is bad (especially the repeated use of a single ""horse whinney"" sound effect used over and over and over...). If you are at all squeemish about watching a group of hungry monks eat a roasted pet dog, don't see this movie. I'd recommend ""Twin Warriors"" or ""Fist of Legend"" for a better show of Jet Li's talents."
3,pretty cool flick,"this is cool flick, but slow at times. if you just want see Jet when he's young and lightning fast, check this out. i love the shaolin training as well. i just didnt like the pace of the film, something. anyway, buy it because if your reading this review your probably already a Jet Li fan and your going to want to add this to your collection.if your just starting out with Jet Li movies, get HERO, The Tai Chi Master, Fist of Legend (orginal, not the US version! ) or Kung Fu Colt Master(its a fantasy swordplay flick, confusing but great!)& Fong Sai Yuk.enjoy!!"
5,"A ""must"" for all do-it-yourself drywall installers!","Drywall: Pro Tips For Hanging And Finishing features more than 380 illustrations and color photos to guide the reader through any drywall project.

Ideal for the do-it-yourself home remodeler, Drywall is the only ""how to"" instruction and reference book that will be needed."
2,Light on the art of drywalling...,"This is a great broad overview of the drywalling process. Lots of pictures of these two guys in blue and red. However, it doesn't tell me what I want to know, the art of getting two boards taped together. The taping chapter needs to be tripled in size."
4,Rich and famous doesn't always equal happy...,"The daughter of a famous actress and producer, teenage Parri has everything she could ask for...materially. Saddled with the additional burden of shyness, Parri's never had many friends. But as she further enters her teen years, Parri begins to realize she has a lot to offer people from her own merits; she just has to make the first move and let them see her for who she really is."
2,Unplugged nice weather for ducks not up to expectations,"The shouty track is a good song in itself, but yet again another 2 track release.Nice weather for ducks (unplugged) has nice music and a nice arrangement, howeever the singing is fairly poor, what made the original so good was the singing. Here it sounds like 2 depressed guys mumbling into the microphone. unfortunate as it could have been so good."
4,The Murderer Vanishes,"Ten Teacups are what summon Chief Inspector Masters and Herny Merrivale to 4 Berwick Terrace. Two years ago, Masters had recived a note about the teacups and had not acted. The next day, a man was dead.Determined not to make the same mistake, Masters and H.M. set up gaurd around Berwick Terrace, where Vance Keating is meeting with a man, in the only furnished room in the entire house. Sergant Pollard is placed infront of the door where Keating is.Suddenly, two gunshots ring out. Pollard throws open the door, to find Keating dead and the window open. Ten Teacups are on the table, two smashed. The dusty carpet shows only Keating's footprints. The window is open. ""He got out through here"" Pollard yelled, sticking his head out the window. On the ground, another cop is positioned, responding with a simple ""No he didn't, no one wen't in or out of that window"" Only H.M., with his baudy stories and paranoia can solve the case of the vanishing murderer."
2,Hard to understand the voice,"I got this for my Grandma because she has trouble seeing. The problem is, the voice on it is not very clear at all. So now, instead of asking me what time the microwave clock shows, she pushes the button on the watch and asks me what time the watch says. Half the time I can't even understand what it said. One more problem is that the buttons and their labels are super small and hard for most elderly people to work."
3,talking watch,"Purchased this watch for my elderly, visually impaired mother. The voice is clear, but the activation buttons are small and she touches the wrong ones when ""seeing"" what time it is. I think this watch would be good for someone a little younger who is visually impaired."
3,Talking Watch,The first watch I received was defective. I told them and they sent me a # to send it back. No Problem! A few days later I received a new one and its working fine. I love it and I'd buy from this Company again.
4,Neat Game and System...,"I bought this system when it very first came out and thought it was the coolest thing ever. Wario Land was one of the three games I had for it and it was by far my favorite. I'll still pull the system out every so often just to play Wario. It has a good story, lots of interesting game play, and neat little secrets hidden here and there. If you like Mario I would say you will like Wario. This is an outdated system, of course, but it's a bit of a rarity. Most if not all of my friends have never heard of, or seen a Virtual Boy. For the longest time I thought that maybe they had been banned or something because they all just kind of disappeared. I would only purchase it you are a game head that loves the old school stuff (Like me ;) and can get into the whole side-scrolling thing and vintage type games. All in all, I do recommend everything about Virtual Boy, but try to keep an open mind about it and the game play it offers."
3,It's Ok,This was a gift and the person who receaved it says it works good with a little time working with it.
3,Ceramic Sharpener,"I must have had a senior moment when I bought this as I was looking for a sharpener with blades. I did buy the one I wanted, but for some reason also bought this. The ceramic doesn't really sharpen knives the way I prefer knives be sharpened. They're OK for scissors, but not when I want a really fine, thin, sharp blade. They're great for people who are afraid to have blades around the house (to use for sharpening), just not me."
3,"OK, not great.","I am using to sharpen kitchen knives. Pro: Low cost; 2 types of ceramic (presumably coarse and fine but it's hard to decide based on my limited use of the tool thus far); no complaint with ability to sharpen knives. Con: The ceramic tubes are recessed a bit too far into each ""side"" of the tool so that the bottom of the ""V"" is at almost the same level as the plastic bridge that joins the two sides. Thus it would be very difficult to use for long without cutting a bit into that bridge, perhaps--but not necessarily--weakening the bridge too much. Time and use will tell. No problem so far but shallow cuts into the bridge are obvious. I also use a Smith's CCKS sharpener and the ""V"" with that tool is sufficiently removed from the bridge to prevent such damage."
2,What are ya gonne do....?,"Does it work? Yes. Is it easy to install? Not really. Some of the screw holes had to be re-tapped as the screws provided weren't self-tapping. Luckly I had a set of metric taps to match the screws provided. Is it worth the price? It was to me because I was tired of the dust and chips and didn't have time or inclination to rig something up. If you need the attachment, you need it. I am quite sure Jet and Amazon are making their profits on this one."
4,Like Power Rangers in a more mature version.,"This is a real old one, but it is a favorite of mine. The storystarts out with this girl with pink hair (kinda looks like theoriginal version of Nene from BGC) has a love for a man namedShapiro. When Shapiro and his girlfriend get into flight combat,Shapiro leaves to persue space...The action is so fast and intense Ihad to put it in slow motion to actually see what was going on. Theaction is definetely on a level of Robotech. Ans since you get 5episodes on one tape, you get more bang for the buck. Definetely aclassic in my book."
2,Martinique crib,"The wood is nice, but other than that we're not too happy with it. It claims to be a 5-in-1 crib -- it's actually 2 in 1. As a crib it's okay, except that the rail guides malfunctioned after less than 6 months -- now we can't lower the rails. Before the rail guides broke, we liked the way you could lower the rail with one hand, but it's not silent going up or down, so your baby could wake up from the noise.Once your child learns to climb out, the hardware is included to make a full size head board and footboard out of it -- you would still have to buy the actual bedframe. They advertise that you can turn it into a toddler bed, but when you read the instructions, it just says to remove the rail -- that doesn't make it a toddler bed -- a toddler bed needs a toddler rail to hold the child in -- Martinique does not come with the toddler rail, and there is not even one available you can get.Since we don't have room for a full size bed, we consider the Martinique a big waste of money."
1,Bad writing,"Plot and characters are adequate, and it doesn't start too badly, but the quality of the writing steadily declines and by mid-book the writing is ghastly. One example:...""Come, children, eat your suppers, and let us not dwell on grim thoughts.""Verona, among alien telepaths, managed to fork it in, with some wisp of appetite left after all the terrors, grainy wafers that were crisp enough, an unidentified vegetable, rehydrated tomato slices, and a protein something that was far from chicken.This is typical. Not incomprehensible, but clunky and awkward. The book just isn't worth the wade."
2,Disappointing sequel to Flesh & Gold (98). Caveat lector,"_____________________________________________I liked herFlesh And Golda lot, recommended it, & was looking forward to the sequel. Well, here it is, and I had to struggle to finish it. The book just didn't make sense! And there are all sorts of extraneous pulpy subplots. And a setup for *another* sequel. Ick.To be fair, there are some beautifully-written parts. And it has a nice cover. And I've seen some positive reviews.So YMMV. But it sure didn't work for me.Happy reading--Pete Tillman"
4,Best of Aware Records,"The sides Loleatta Holloway cut for Aware between 1971 and 1975 , stand alongside the very finest soul music ever made. I rate it 4 because of the very poor cd quality: as if it were recorded from vinyl."
1,Let's do better for Loleatta,"There is some good music on this disc - music that should be ascertained from another source.The sound quality is poor (Remastered, I think not). There is no track information - no recording or release dates, musician personnel, chart information - nothing at all. There are not even any photos. There is only about 45min of music on this disc.Don't waste your money on this - or any other ""Collectibles"" compilation disc."
2,The Scarlet Letter,Gave as christmas Present. IT SKIPS IN AREAS OF THE MOVIE. WILL NOT BUY FROM AGAIN
5,GARY IS THE BEST,"THIS FILM IS THE BEST AND SO IS GARY OLDMAN. I HAVE THE SOUNDTRACK AND I AM FOREVER WATCHING THIS FILM AND LISTENING TO THE SOUNDTRACK. THIS FILM IS A MUST WATCH, NO MATTER WHAT THE CRITICS SAY."
1,Why can't I give this video 0 stars.,"The reviewers who gave this video more then 2 stars must not have read the book. How dare the makers of this viedo call it the Scarlet Letter. I saw very littel in the video that had anything to do with the novel. When I started to watch the video I knew I was in trouble when it was stated the video was ""loosely based on Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel""."
1,More comedy than drama...,"I can't be as descriptive as several who reviewed this movie, but can tell you I'm glad I bought it at a used video store where I could get my money back. I never have liked Demi Moore; her voice is too raspy for this role. She tries to be sincere and just can't cut it. I watched it solely because I like Gary Oldman. His acting was okay....I adore him in Immortal Beloved. I wouldn't recommend anyone wasting their money on either renting or purchasing this version of The Scarlet Letter. I own a copy of nearly all period movies set back in the 16th to 19th century eras, and this was one that wasn't worthy of joining my collection nor was it worth the 2+ hours I spent watching it. I just kept waiting for it to get better, and waiting...but it didn't...and the very kindest word I can choose to describe it is, disappointing."
1,"It's a movie, but it's not The Scarlet Letter","I have nothing against bad movies. I often enjoy their badness. This movie is so bad that I can't enjoy it, though, and I especially do not enjoy its abuse of the title ""The Scarlet Letter."" It has two things in common with Hawthorne's novel: the names of its two main characters.This movie sucks bad.Interesting note: Gary Oldman has said that his former abuse of vodka only impaired his performance in one movie and he hinted strongly that this was the one. It is said that he had to resort to reading from cue cards and having his lines fed to him through an earpiece because he could not remember them, in the scaffold scene among others.Demi Moore can make as many strong-woman movies as she wants. She shouldn't steal the titles of classic novels to do so."
1,If youre studying for a test don't watch this film to review,"I feel sick to my stomach!!!and i really like this cast (Oldman, Moore, Duvall)... the actors have my respectBut this film... I am almost speechless. I would not say that the book The Scarlett Letter is my favorite, however it is a classic and therefore must be respected... right?I am aparently wrong. This movie is a mockery of what Hawthorne intended (that can be easily seen - just from the movie's tag line) and insults the art of page to screen adaptation... this movie does deserve one star purely b/c it made me laugh... Pearl is narrating??? Does this even take place during the same period of time??? Who is that slave woman???It could be that I am confused but I just finished the book"
3,Not to be confused with the novel.,"It's a Demi Moore star-vehicle. And when they say 'freely adapted,' they mean it. I highly doubt Nathanial Hawthorne wrote a ten minute sex scene into his book. But hey... Gary Oldman is in it. And I stand firm in my belief that he can rescue just about any bad movie. He outshines everyone. Even Robert Duval, and that speaks volumes to his talent. (Again, why hasn't he been nominated for an Oscar?) Without him, the movie would be complete fluff. It borders on fluff as it is, but Oldman adds some depth, thank goodness. Moore is boring. The overt sexual-nature of the film overpowers the plot. Which is fine, if you don't really care about the plot. Honestly, with this much deviation from the original book, they could have called it something else and perhaps dissapointed less people (especially the literary types)."
3,"Good movie, great stars, SO not historically correct!","If I hadn't read the book before watching, I would have loved this movie. As it was, I read the Hawthorne novel and ended up laughing all the way through. Shamefully, only about 3 minutes of this movie was actually in the book. If you don't care about history, it's a very good movie for entertainment. If you plan on watching this instead of reading or need to write a book report on the story, please buy the Spark or Cliff notes - or - read the book - it gets better in the second chapter."
2,Hawthorne...but not quite Hawthorne,"If you've never read The Scarlet Letter before, then by all means watch this film, but when you do eventually read the book, the ending will surprise you, but I won't spoil the surprise for either the book or the film. It is not a great film, which is a shame, because the book is! Watch for Gary Oldman's and Demi Moore's amusing accents if nothing else!! END"
3,It is worth the trouble of getting through it.,"The Scarlet letter is a good book it can be somewhat hrd to understand. But the plot is exellent. Some of the charcters are well developed while others remain secritive and shy. Hester goes through many changes and becomes a stronger woman, while Dimmesdale becomes a weak soul lost in guilt. He feels that he should not let Hester sufer while he gains glory. The symbolism of the book is somewhat foggy but it can be figured out with some thought. This book can mean several things mattering on when you read it and what has happened to you in your life. END"
5,I love this movie!,"Apparently, a lot of people think this movie sucks. But I personally thought it was great-the acting was good and the story was full of action, adventure, and best of all, hot sizzling romance! This movie is not easily forgotten-If you havent seen The Scarlet Letter, give a try!!"
1,This deserves no stars at all,"I cannot describe my rancor directed towards this movie in mere words, but I will try. This is the absolute worst movie of all time. I have never seen something that could go more against itself in every way. My description of the Count of Monte Cristo movie pales in comparison to what I feel about this one. In one word, it is vile. The entire focus of the book, however much I did not like it, was shifted to a Hollywood action movie filled with stupidity. The main character in the book is absolutely nothing like the one in the movie. The despair that the book projected is not even visible in the movie, which just happens to be one of its best parts. I mean, for God sakes, the man is saved by the arrow of an Indian from a hanging! WHERE DID THAT COME FROM? Anyway, to say more would only be rambling, so I leave with a suggestion: never see this movie, EVER!"
3,Pretty Average,"I have to give this one mixed reviews. Gary Oldman was great. Demi was OK. I'm not sure how I felt about Robert Duval's performance. He brought an intensity to the role, but his accent just didn't quite make it. Photography was beautiful. They really aren't kidding when they say loosely adapted, so if you're looking for something that follows that high school required reading, this isn't it."
3,Realism with a point,"Having read the classic story, and veiwed the video itself, within a matter of days, I must admit that the movie was freely adapted from the original story. Not to imply the movie was bad. I felt the movie truly captivated the set period in a realistic manner. Moore's acting was quite good as well. She effectively gave off the sense of a woman ahead of her own time, searching for true love, along with discovering her hidden sensuality."
3,Scarlet Letter,"Although the movie veered off from where the book went, I found that, differently from the book, the movie focused more on the intimacy between Hester and Dimmsdale (which for the hopeless romantics out there like me-- is a perk!) I loved the actor who plays Dimmsdale and Demi Moore comes through with a strong performace as well."
4,Entertaining,"This story is an entertaining one if not seen as a representation of Hawthorne's novel. Rated R with good reason: sex, nudity, and violence."
5,Cinematic Masterpiece...Above even Kubrick!,"This film is beyond compare..Its easily the best film this decade. Demi Moore is brilliant as is the direction and script. I watch this film as i go to bed each night, each scene relived in each and every dream. In fact, i have even be known to masturbate over Demi and her ultra mean confidence. What can i say? A superb movie and one that need sto be seen with a hanky."
4,Great movie in its own right...,"Forget the classic Hawthorne novel...put all that aside. Pretend you've never read it. This movie is loosely based on that story, so don't waste your time comparing it or you'll miss the brilliance of this film.Demi Moore actually pulls off some fine acting and Gary Oldman is captivating...I can still see those blue eyes. Robert Duvall is basically a nut, but that is entertaining in itself. The love story is sweet, sentimental, and beautiful.Don't judge this film for its abilty to accurately portray the novel, just watch it for its own unique story and experience it for yourself."
1,consider the source,Anyone who would award this movie five stars is unlikely to possess the intellect necessary to read Hawthorne.
5,Movies are never like the books.....,"I read the book AFTER I saw the movie. Movies are never like the books. Everyone knows that. This movie somewhat updated some of the ideas in the book. Such as witchcraft, etc. It also showed the role of the Native Americans during this puritan era. It is an excellent period movie. If no one knew it was based on the novel, I think the criticism would be different.Gary Oldman is excellent as the reverend, and I believed Demi as the rebellious puritan woman. The love story is intense."
1,"A Truly, TRULY, Terrible Movie Beginning To End!","I hope if O sama is captured by the US he is forced to sit through this movie ten times a day.Demi More's laughable and yet still painfully boring production of The Scarlet Letter is simply one of the worst motion pictures ever made. It is not merely bad, but remarkably bad. I found it completely absurd, tedious, ludicrous, and felt it was ""freely adapted"" to the detriment of the depth of the original source. This feminist, new agey re-telling of a classic bears scant resemblance to the Hawthorne tale and is unworthy of sharing the title. Sometimes a free adaptation can improve upon the original novel, as with the 1990's version of The Last of the Mohicans, but in this case the reverse was never truer. I could go on and on with what is wrong with this film but why don't I just say EVERYTHING is wrong with this film. Never have I laughed harder AT, not WITH, a movie in my life."
4,Gary Oldman!...,"As a huge Gary Oldman fan, of course i enjoyed the movie. Though it deviates from the novel by Nathaniel Hawthorne, which is not neccarily a bad thing mind you, it still holds itself together rather well. Gary Oldman's acting is the highlight of the film, and though Demi Moore etc, all do a decent job, Gary Oldman shines out is a touching and fresh take on Arthur Dimsdale. Whereas in the novel i felt less of a connection to the characters, by the end of the film i was in tears, though the ending of the novel is better-though no so happy, I still feel that the film version works very well, keeping somewhat true to the novel, and offering up a perhaps more entertaining take on the Hawthorne classic."
2,Eagle Eye Review,The only reason I like this movie is that I was in it. The story itself was loosely written from the book The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne. It is a little bit too long.
5,"""The Scarlet Letter"" is a favorite","I am a tremendous Gary Oldman fan and Demi More was wonderful, great pairing in a great film. I recieved ""The Sacrlet Letter"" dvd in good time, in Great condition and for a good price. Thank you."
4,LOVE,"THIS IS ONE OF MY OLD TIME FAVORITE MOVIE WITH GARY AND DEMI, I LOVE THE PASSION AND DETERMINATION TO FIGHT FOR THEIR LOVE."
3,Lacking authenticity,"The quality of the DVD was without blemish. Unfortunatley, the fault lies with the film-maker's vision. It states quite accurately in the beginning that the film was ""freely"" adapted from the original literature. As a teacher, I look for work that exemplifies a particular time period and remains true to the author's original intent. This adaptation was lacking on all fronts. Just as a brief glimpse into the failure of the production, take a moment to consider horrid accents that fluctuate from scene to scene. If you are a Demi Moore fan and can't live without one of her acting attempts, by all means purchase; however, if your intent is to get an accurate message of Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter, forget it."
5,Before She Cheats,I never read the novel so I didn't enter into this with any expecatations. I think Demi Moore did a fantastic job and she totally immersed herself in the role. The intersting story and the passionate acting by Demi Moore and Gary Oldman make this film an enjoyable piece of entertainment. It deserves way more than 3 stars.
1,Lest We Forget,"We are rating this movie - not the grand epic of guilt, revenge and redemption that Hawthorne wrote.This movie is trash. To comment that a character who is NOT in the book is underdeveloped is ludicrous.Scarlet Letter with Indians and a happy ending is Fennimore Cooper. And we all know where his reputation is."
2,"a hokey, amusing version of the scarlet letter","The Scarlet Letter is pure Hollywood...a sensual love scene between a preacher and an ""innocent"" waif, an indian fight in the middle of nowhere, and Demi Moore masturbating in a bathtub. The problem here, is that Demi Moore is completely wrong for this part in all ways. She loses the innocence that Hester Prynne had in the book, and changes her into a 19th century slut. She is all wrong for a period piece, and her accent proves it. However, you can't blame a gifted actress like Moore for a movie that is all together sloppy. I'm not going to say, ""stick to the book"", but this movie is a dud. However, if you do see it once, you might find a certain guilty pleasure amongst all the ludicrous actions that take place within this movie, which is why I give it 2 stars."
3,Strays from Hawthorne and not very good anyway!,"Not terrible but I wanted to see the re-creation of Hawthorne's novel...not some overly brutal, cowboys vs. indians movie for prime time tv. Oh, well, at least Pearl is cute"
5,This seems like a good idea,This purchases made Spurling moment I have no clue what it was for ornament use it for but it looks good I like it and you have a great day
1,A BETRAYAL OF HAWTHORNE'S VISION,"Vapid pseudo-adaptation of Nathaniel Hawthorne's timeless novel of guilt, conscience, and the darker side of religion. Inverts the original novel's themes of prejudice and redemption into a New Age libertine manifesto. The atrocious script has some of the worst dialogue ever and plays like a deranged parody of Hawthorne's magnificent prose. Great cast of Demi Moore, Gary Oldman and Robert Duvall is totally wasted. For a much better film treatment of many of the same themes see ""The Crucible,"" but avoid this travesty at all costs."
5,Perfect!,Our Granddaughter saw a bee on a cartoon and just had to have it so we ordered Buzz from Amazon and had it waiting for her on her next visit with us. She was so exited and hasn't let it leave her sight very much since she got it! Came when promised and love it!
5,Great taste and good for you!,"Had these as a child and was thrilled to find them online here. Be forewarned, they make taking vitamins enjoyable! :-)"
5,JanS.,Nice taste. Like a sweet tart. High amount of mg. for one tablet too. I would recommend to a friend.
1,TERRIBLE. I had to return it,"This is a total piece of junk. I bought this for an online class and it didn't work. I had to return it. Basically, the sound quality was so poor (lots of crackling & background noise) that I couldn't hear my voice and couldn't use it for class.Do no buy this, unless you want to be disappointed!"
1,Piece of Junk -- get the Rockler table and fence system,"I have a Ridgid 14"" bandsaw, and while putting this fence on the saw was no big deal (went on pretty easily, altho I did have to shim out the rails), the clamping pad on the fence itself fell off after just a few weeks.I'm talking about the little piece of plastic that was POORLY glued on the clamp of the fence itself. It fell off repeatedly, even after I glued it back on repeatedly with Gorilla Glue, hot glue, epoxy, Superglue, you name it, I tried it.I finally gave up and got the Rockler bandsaw table and fence combo. Now I have a much bigger table and a fence that locks down securely in a T track with no wobble, not to mention a circle cutting guide and a resaw fence.Don't waste your money, go straight for the Rockler table and fence system."
2,Ted,Talk about deceptive advertising! The picture of this product shows both fences. Only the rip fence and resaw guide comes with this product. Bummer! You would at least tell a person that the other guide is not included.
4,Porter Cable users beware,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16""x16"" work table -- falls short. I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is, of course, not the fault of the manufacturer. It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it). The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble, nice packaging, and quick shipping. Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
1,Sonics are the catch,"This is some of the more interesting music I have heard from Carulli, and expressively and expertly played by Richard Savino on a very interesting looking instrument that you can see in the notes. However, the recorded CD sound is not good, perhaps the worst of the many guitar albums I have owned. The frequency response seems to cut off at about 4000 Hz, making the guitar sound muffled and unrealistic. We may be talking about quality control at Naxos instead of recording glitches, but my advice is: do not buy this CD unless you need the music and do not mind a smothered guitar."
2,Not as good as a lot of people would have you think.,"Yes, The Sounds have a very produced ""sound"" that to unexperienced ears comes off as catchy and rockin. The fact is the sound of this Swedish band is super sugar-coated and unsophisticated. Take a look at the song titles, ""Rock n' Roll"", ""Dance With Me"", and ""Riot"". The songs are almost as unoriginal as their titles. Comparing this band to Blondie is a stretch. The keyboard player doesn't seem to know what a chord is and the rest of group is playing at the same volume for the duration of the record. If you're in jr. high, go for it, if you're looking for a lasting rock album, go elsewhere."
4,Good but I've heard it before,"The songs ""sound"" very good, but they also sounded good when Blondie and all of the New Way bands put out the exact same thing. It is pretty easy to sound good if you pick good people to sound like. The White Stripes are masters at it because they take from so many different sources. Bands like Pallo Alto, the Vines and Ataris are a little more obvious using sources ranging from Radiohead to the Goo Goo Dolls. I'm sick of thinking to myself that I have heard that song before. I hate when people compare bands and say they are a blend of certain bands before them. No, they are simply not original stale attempts of the record industry to make money through an easily set plan. The one thing that stands out about the Sounds is their extremely fine guitar player Felix. DAMN!!!!!!!! He is fine!!!!!!!!!!! I wish I could get some of that!!!! That is why the live show gets 5 stars. When you put the picture and sound together, it is a great combo."
2,Fell short of my expectations.,"I was disappointed in this album. I had heard one song by them (Rock 'N Roll) prior to purchasing this CD, and really liked it. But sadly, the CD as a whole fell very short of my expectations."
1,This CD raped my ears,"If i could give this 0 stars i would, i felt violated after listening to it. Then i threw up and poped my ear drums so there was no possible chance that i could hear it again."
4,fun songs for a rockin good time,"I had vaguely heard of The Sounds before, and I had skimmed through an article in Rolling Stone so when I saw the cd at the listening booth at Tower Records I gave them a listen. Right away I loved it! The drum beats are very catchy, and the synthesizers bring back sort of an eighties touch. I love to sing a long to songs, so with this cd at times its a problem because of the singers accent I often am not sure what shes really saying. The singer has an awesome voice that is very catchy. Best tracks on the cd, I think, are : Hit Me!, Rock'n Roll, Like a Lady, and Hope You're Happy Now. I think if you are a fan of Hot Hot Heat, theres a good chance you will thoroughly enjoy The Sounds."
5,Total ear candy!,You could get cavities from listening to this record and I think my teeth may fall out soon. This record is so catchy yet unlike most pop-ish music I keep listening without getting tired of it.My closest comparison would be Debbie Harry with a sore throat and an accent.
5,RAD SWEDES,this band is going to take over the states. they're so far ahead of U.S. punk/pop bands it's ridiculous.
3,Good for what it is,"I law them live in Kansas City not too long ago so I thought I'd grab their CD. Its good; there's a lot of skill put into it, but its not great; definitely not worth 5 stars. Of course, if you're even listening to the CD, then you probably already know of the band and appreciate the niche of music their filling, so in regards to what their doing with eastern Euro punk The Sounds are to be commended. Some of it sounds a little too Euro to me, especially the insistent keyboarding, but that, of course, is just opinion."
5,The Sounds review,"This album is fanatasic.The sounds put a whole new pop in our music today and are simply the best band ive heard since Blondie.If i could give the album stars, i would give it 10 stars and put it in as best album of the year.The sounds are my favorite band"
3,Pretty Good,"This is an Okay Cd, a few good tracks, but they should really tell the keyboard player to tone it down a bit and their songs are a bit repetitive.To give this CD 5 stars is absolutly ridiculous, it's a good effort, but far from perfect...I suggest you download it instead of buying it...The best songs are ""Seven days a week"", ""Living in America"" and ""Hit me"" (those are also the only videos they have...hmm, strange coincidence)...The lyrics in my opinion are way too shallow, someone said that ""7 days a week"" was about a friend's death, I dont see how the hell (s)he got that ????....Sometimes spacey lyrics can be good (ex: Strokes, White Stripes, Interpol, The Pattern), but here it just doesn't work...I dont know about the live show, but i would sure as hell pay 10 bucks to see Felix (the guitarist) in person, my goodness that man is beautiful, but that of course is besides the point,My apologies..."
1,bad,"a friend o mine dumped some of his CDs at my place which is how i ended up with this sounds crap, yikes!!! this would be great music if i was a 14 year old girl. the lyrics and beats are super cheesy and the funny part is that the band will add an occasional naughty word here and there to validate them as something more then teeny bop, leave this trash alone... go buy GG Allin instead if you wanna kick out some hardcore."
4,Reminds me of blondie,If you're a blondie fan I would suggest you give this cd a listen to... You will like....
4,From Nowhere I Heard,"The Sounds. The from out of nowhere band that I happened to catch on a daytime variety show. They performed Seven Days A Week. And during the middle of the performance, I knew I would definitely like this band.Maja Ivarsson's similarity to the Blondie in both looks and sound is uncanny. And instead of trying to be a rip-off, she takes her own stand and is her own person. The band supplies some great beats and backup to Ivarsson's singing. Some may say that a lot of the songs sound alike. I say they don't, listen to The Donnas for that.The Sounds breathes fresh air into a reminiscent 80s sound, and Living In America is a great album."
5,I LOVE THE SOUNDS!,"This is my second review for this album, because I am so excited about this band. In my opinion, this is the best debut album I have heard in the past five years. I seriously have not been that addicted to an album and in love with the band for a very long time now. Maja Ivarsson(the singer for The Sounds), I want to seriously make hot love to her backstage. By the way, right now is the best time to catch this band live in the U.S. This is because you will probably get to meet the band, since they are so new and no one really knows who they are here in the states. I have heard of many people that went to their shows and actually got to meet them. So listen to The Sounds and hit the night life, cause that is what I'm doing tonight."
4,I Love The Sounds!,I saw The Sounds on televison and purchased this CD the next day. I was not dissapointed. This CD is full of cool late 1970s/early 1980s new wave garage sounding rock. The lead singer sounds a lot like Wendy James from the 1990s British band Transvision Vamp.
3,Minimal romance and undeveloped characters,"Grace Valley physician Dr. June Hudson awaits the return of her secret lover, DEA agent Jim Post, and gets a shock when her first love, Jim Forrest (yeah, two leading men named Jim...) returns to town divorced and ready to resume their relationship with his rowdy teenage sons in tow. Since she has remained single, everyone in town assumes she'll take up with Forrest, but she'd rather wait for the other Jim. When mysterious bones turn up, finally the small town has something else to keep them occupied besides her love life.Not realizing that this story was part of a series, I was at a disadvantage. Undeveloped characters kept popping up in the story, and felt out of place. One main character was absent throughout most of the novel. And the romance itself was minimal. When compared to her later novels like ""Never too Late,"" this one just falls short at 2.5 stars."
3,GV2,I liked this book because I like the characters and I like knowing there will be more. I like the small town friendliness and nosiness.
5,JUST OVER THE MOUNTAIN,THE FOLKS AND THE TOWN OF THE GRACE VALLEY ARE SO REAL I AM READY TO MOVE TO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.
5,Love Robyn Carr,I choose this rating as I greatly enjoy Robyn Carr's writing. I read all 14 of her Virgin River Series and couldn't wait to read this Grace Valley Trilogy.
5,Just over the mountain,It wad good will read more from this author she is very easy to read look forward to more of her books. Ii
5,Just Over the Mountain,I enjoyed this book very much and the other Robyn Carr books in the Virgin River and Grace Valley series.
5,Grave Valley Trilogy,"This installment of the Grave Valley Trilogy sets up a love triangle between the heroine and two men, both named Jim."
4,Just over the Mountain book review,"An enjoyable book, for those who like Robyn Carr's Virgin River series a must but a good trilogy to introduce new readers to her. Well written, engaging story."
4,Just OverThe mountain,I love Robyn Carr's books. I feel like I'm part of Grace Valley community. It is surpassed only by her Virgin Rivers Series.
5,Another quicky...,I've enjoyed the way this story is in part's. It has helped in me getting throught it much faster than I normally would. The fact the storie is VERY good help's too!!!! I would recommend this serie's to reader's of any age.
3,Coffey's secret revealed.,"Don't look at the splash/teaser page of this installment, though, or it'll be spoiled for you. Finally something of significance happens, though I'm still not finding myself all that interested in most of the story or the characters. Despite each volume being only 90 or so pages in rather large print, I think the serial format is making the whole novel seem longer than it actually is. I just hope the payoff at the end makes plodding through all this worth it."
5,Percy Wetmore must die!,"It's about frying time for Eduard. Man that Percy is such a jerk! I was just starting to like Eduard, kinda hoping he would make it through the series. Poor Mr. Jingles. Almost made me want to cry. Not quite, but almost, after all it's just a mouse. Can't wait to see what happens next."
5,Beautiful mixture of both sides,I just recently bought and hear all tha songs and was totally tranced by the ryhthm and music composed. It is an exciting experience and wondeful music I ever came accross! I would 100% recommend this album to anyone.
5,Very fresh fresh scent - while it lasts,"I love this scent. Very fresh and distinctive. However, the longevity is not good at all.This is a good daytime EDT... But you will need to re-apply if you want it to last through the day -- just don't over apply, as this scent has the potential to get cloying. Due to low longevity, it really doesn't deserve 5 stars, but it is such a nice scent I didn't want to give it a 4 either."
2,Eh,"I bought this based on the reviews and I know I should not done that, although most people described it to be awesome, I just don't like it. Too musky for my taste!"
1,Fake Colongue?,Smell does not last long at all. I use to have this Cologne bought from Macy and that scent lasted a lot longer. I can only smell it if I am sniffing my clothes. Anyone else have this problem? I noticed all the good reviews are from back than anyone else bought this recently?
3,Kenneth Cole - Reaction,This is masculine smelling perfume. Not too strong and the ladies love it. My wife bought this as a present for my nephew and he loved it. Appropriate for the evening and daytime. REally nice.
1,worst purchase ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"ohhhhhhhhhh,i m very shocked i bought Kenneth Cole reaction by Kenneth Cole for men 1.7 oz EDT spray for my husband s birthday and i received Kenneth Cole gel shower!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!oh,i contacted the seller so so many times but he did not answer....my husband did not need the shower gel so he throw it in the bathroom he has never used it.we were stunned it s the worst purchase ever and the worst seller in the world,............i regret buying this item from this stupid seller!"
5,MASCULINE AND ENERGETIC,"""Zesty"" is a word that comes to mind when first catching a scent of Kenneth Cole's ""Reaction,"" It's a very masculine and energetic fragrance with notes of Juicy Lime and Crisp Green Apple. It reminds one of a guy who's on the go, very much alive. He's fun, contemporary, intelligent.Reaction"" also boasts hints of Watermelon, Patchouli, Sandalwood and Musk."
5,Great Summer Smell,"I have bought several bottles of this now and I love it. I get compliments on it all the time. I wear it for most of the summer months and change to something a bit stronger during the winter or for more formal events (Burberry London or similar). It is a great casual cologne. I get compliments on it all the time. It is a discrete sweet summery smell with hints of fruit. I'm not a guy to buy a cologne that the best way you can describe is ""fruity"" but I really do like its unique and subtle nature. I went in to a local outlet and they were completely sold out so I am buying it online. I smelt a few alternatives but nothing was the same."
3,Acceptable,"I have use this cologne for several years now and I normally buy this from Kenneth Cole stores directly. Since like a year ago they stop having this item in its inventory, I decided to buy it from Amazon. I have to admit that the fragrance of the Amazon's cologne is the same as the one at the stores, the difference is that Amazon's doesnt last that much, usually it wears out in about 4 hours vrs Store's all day long.If you are having a hard time finding this product at stores I recommend to buy this cologne, but keep in mind that you will have to re-apply it around 4 hours after the first application."
5,Smells Bomb,Smells so good my girlfriend says I smell like a slut. : ) I guess it just makes her jealous
3,Fake? I don't know,"I'm not going to claim this is fake however, the scent is gone within 2-3 hours regardless of how much you put on. Smells like Reaction out of the bottle but seems like it might be watered down......"
2,Sharp Scent,I had another bottle of Reaction when I got this one and did a scent comparison of name brand vs what I was delivered and the result was the amazing scent I was used to was now marred by a sharp edge. I have sworn by this cologne and used it for years and what I received was not what I have bought in years past.
3,"kenneth cole reaction, eau de toilette 3.4 oz.","The price is great and the bottle appears authentic but the scent is weaker than the kenneth cole reaction, eau de toilette 3.4 oz. that I previously purchased at the leading department stores."
3,Okay Scent,The scent is alright just like every other eau de toilette. It's very light so it's hard for others to even smell it. I thought it would be unique and different according to the description of other customers. Perhaps it depends on your type. I'd prefer something else over Reaction.
4,Good cologne,"I just thought it would have a bit of a different smell than described, I guess I was looking for something a bit less musky, but it's very strong and long lasting, great manly smell! Just not exactly how I expected"
2,Very dissatisfied,"I don't know what happened to this cologne,Is it amazon or is it KC.Tje cologne has the fresh smell that I like but it doesn't stay on long.You can buy bod for men and it will stay on longer.I will not be buying colognes from amazon again"
5,Perfect scent for the perfect lady,"Wanna be a ""lady killer""? This is the stuff for you. Works every time without fail.. Now that I am in a dedicated relationship, I havent bought it in a while, but it smells great either way - I highly recommend this product!"
1,Horrible fragrance,"After seeing that this product was one of the highly rated products in the fragrance section I decided to buy only to be highly disappointed by it.I am not sure if I received a fake or this perfume generally smells this way, whatever the reason I hated the fragrance. I bought this around 4 months back and have used it only once or twice. NOT RECOMMENDED"
1,Doubt the purity of this stuff,I have now bought two different sprays ( RL Blue for women and this one) . For both of them I have felt that the intesity is too low. The only time you smell it is when you spray it.. ( or actually sniff your collars) .. In my opinion.. just buy these kinda stuff from the shop ( a reputed one ) directly... Just my two cents...
1,Not The Real Thing,"I bought this cologne on Amazon because I had purchased some in the store and really liked it. When seeing how much less Reaction was on amazon I was excited to order some. I ordered it, sprayed some on, and very quickly noticed the smell did not last as long as the store bought version I had gotten. In fact I would say the smell lasts maybe ten minutes if that. I sprayed on a lot more to see if it would smell longer and it made no difference. Unless Amazon corrects this issue, I won't buy cologne from them again. There is a very clear difference and this is a cheap imitation. It's so bad it's worth throwing out. I really like Amazon so this was a big disappointment."
3,BE WARNED!,"WARNING!! - ""The Birds of Europe"" by Killian Mullarney and ""The Complete Guide to the Birds of Europe"" by Lars Svensson are THE EXACT SAME BOOK! I don't know why Amazon is trying to entice you to buy both books together (it's probably a slip of the software) BUT BE WARNED!!!"
4,great as reference book,"fabulous book but too large and heavy to use as a field guide. I thought I was buying a smaller book like a field guide, but will keep it as a reference book."
2,"Fascinating, Captain.","Computer-composed music is in its infancy, but David Cope's EMI (Experiments in Musical Intelligence) is at the forefront. Because the music is programmed to ""sound like"" Bach, Chopin, Mozart, Joplin, Gershwin and others, Cope's musical pastiches are more advanced, artistically, than similar efforts in computer-authored literature (see Racter ""The Policeman's Beard Is Half-Constructed"").Unfortunately, this first disc is all programmed on a Yamaha digital piano, with the result that it is fairly dry and monochromatic. The second disc, ""Classical Music Composed By Computer,"" benefits from being performed (by good old humans) on a variety of instruments."
2,An interesting idea made unenjoyable by performance,"This is quite an interesting project; I almost wish that I had access to some sort of text explaining exactly what kind of codes are used to produce the music where the styles are ""learned"" from the past musical greats. The booklet describes the impressions from Cope himself, but they do not go much beyond impressions and are not very useful in knowing what makes things succeed and not succeed in imitating certain musical styles by a computer.The performance is less than desirable; all the piano pieces sound as if they are played by a MIDI instrument coded with all the ""velocity"" setting at a constant value. Hence this one really fails as a recording; it sounds like the CD is worth getting only if it happens to be available at library."
1,This thing is crap.,"The audio is terrible. The only upside is you can actually get the buttons to work with windows 7. But the audio is so horrible, it's unusable. It has no way of removing background noise. Folks had a hard time hearing me on the other end. I had a hard time hearing them. Straight to the trash."
3,"Great idea, great price, mediocre execution","I had high hopes for this device when I bought it. It's easy to install and use, and works great other than the sound quality. The speakerphone on the unit itself is fine. I can hear and understand the people i'm talking to, but the microphone on it is awful, no one can understand me. I even tried plugging in my own microphone into the jacks on the back of the unit and it still had the problem.Still a great unit if you don't need the microphone to work!"
3,Angel wing set,I bought these for my 20 second grade students who performed Joy to the World in a Winter Assembly. They looked adorable and they were a big hit!
3,"Great for moldings, modest for planing","I've had mine for about a year and a half now. The reason I bought it was to match original moldings in my house restoration project and the RBI systems were out of my price range. It is a bit time consuming to switch between planing and molding, but after getting the routine down it is getting quicker and more accurate. There were some burrs on the gears that change the speed, but after cleaning them up has made the job a lot quicker. Once the machine is set for planing or molding, it does a really nice job. You definitely need a dust collector hooked up and the outfeed roller set is a big help in reducing snipe. Overall, it is very capable of meeting a hobbiest level woodworking, but the planing cut isn't that aggressive to do a big stack of wood all at once. If some one is considering molding making as well as occasional planing, it is a nice machine to meet those needs."
1,Woodworker,I purchased a JPM 13 and when I tried to get parts for it they told us that we could buy the planer but they did not carry parts for it. I hope you post this because I am disappointed that you cant buy parts for it even though you still sell it. James
1,Possibly worth a 99 cent 5 day rental...,"This a very low budget film set in a space ship with 8 crew searching for a new planet for humans to move to. Earth in bad shape with greenhouse warming and war looming. Crew awakes from hyper-sleep after 100 years under (as is family at home). Captian is dead. More deaths follow. Where these all accidents or is there a killer among them. Very low budget, basically only the sets on the ship. Soundtrack unexciting. Two seperate scenes of nude characters make rating R. No swearing that I remember. No sex scenes either. No pubic hair. Steals ideas from several big screen movies any sci-fi fan will have seen. If its on commercial TV, probably not worth watching. Slightly better than ""BATS"", ""ATTACK OF KILLER TOMATOES"" and ""ARRIVAL II""..."
3,a plain biography of Amy Carmichael,"As a short book that seeks to cover the entire life of Amy Carmichael, it is written like a college thesis. While the book covers many of the facts of the facts about Carmicheal's life, the lackadaisical research and uninspired writing leave the reader still yearning to get to know the inner Carmichael as she strove mightily for God and the lost children of India. The book does not quite do the justice to the subject it seeks to cover."
2,Not very big,Made of fantastic material but it is not big enough for much. It will not make a coverlet for a Queen size bed. not long enough for a tall person to lay down.Too Bad because it is a very nicely made product.Make it so it will just cover a queen size bed and you will have something much more useful.
5,Birth Without Violence,"Although I first read this book 30 years ago, its message is still as vital today. I highly recommend it to all expectant parents as well as those medical and mental health practitioners interested in a simple way to bring more peaceful and less traumatized children into the world. As a soon-to-be grandparent, Birth Without Violence topped the list of ""must-haves"" for my daughter."
3,Different-worth reading at least once,"First let me say, I haven't read the entire book. What I have read is quite interesting. It is completely different than any other birth book I've read and I have read alot! The book is written to give you insight into how the baby views birth. Though I do not fully agree with the author's thoughts on how babies view birth, the book does provide a different thought that is worth at least exploring to stretch the mind. Most of us view birth from the mother's or a by-standers view-point, but the book forces you to think about how the baby views it. Again, I do not fully agree with the author, but I do find it similar to Socrates in that it stretches the mind to think in ways only another person can introduce."
2,THIS BOOK,"This book was not in the least bit helpful. It is more like ""listening to a speech"" than reading a USEFUL knowledge giving book. I believe most of the ideas are now in practice, and are commonplace in birthing pratices. After reading this book I was disappointed. What the book had to say I believe is useful but they use too many unneeded words and waste paper."
4,Birth with dignity and respect for babies,"After four hospital births, I was finally fed up with impersonal childbirth. This book was one of the first books I read while preparing for the homebirth of our fifth child. It was one of the few birth books that evoked respect for babies and peace at birth as opposed to a clinical presentation of birth. Our culture needs more books of this sort to show women that we need to birth our babies in a much more dignified manner, taking into consideration a genuine love for babies. Expectant couples everywhere should take a look at ""Birth without Violence."" Beautiful writing style and great photos!"
5,A timeless book of great beauty.,"The author shows what the birth of a child would look like if it were done from the point of view of the baby. He does this with a gentle narative and the most amazing photographs of a new born in the act of coming into this world. He also gives birth to something else: to the idea that the baby is fully alive and alert at birth and aware of his/hers surroundings. Be prepared to be horrified at the realization of how babies are ""normally"" treated, how YOU were probably treated, and what scars that has left. Don't be surprised if you feel a sense of mission of put this book in the hands of every doctor who ever did or ever will receive a license to practice medicine. A good campanion for this book would be anything on the topic Fetal Stimulation, that is: communicating with babies still in the womb eg. the Make Way for Baby video put out by AMPHION Communications or the Brave New Babies program that appeared on The Learning Channel late one night in 1997."
5,"The Author, Leboyer, Has Delivered More Than 10,000 Babies","This book will give parents-to-be techniques for easing the birth trauma and helping the new human being to start life without pain, confusion, and fear. This book is revolutionizing the way we bring our children into the world. The book is affordable and available on the Amazon Marketplace for as low as one cent."
3,Good music and strong peformances.,"Five of the pieces on this 1995 CD are also on the 1993 Weelkes and Tomkins anthology by Marlow and the Choir of Trinity College Cambridge on Conifer 74321-16071-2. However that disc, if it is still obtainable, is full price yet this one is budget. There is little difference in the performances, both are excellent; though Summerly takes things a little faster than Marlow (for example ""When David heard that Absalom was slain"" is 4:03 on Summerly's recording, 4:52 with Marlow). Playing time 61'36"". Full notes and texts."
1,Not a quality product,I bought this because it was half the price of the oem replacement. Now I know why. I started getting a popping noise when turning the wheel only after two months. I called Monroe and they don't honor any warranty. It looks and feels like a cheap piece of junk compared to the motorcraft one.
5,Finding a Job God's Way,"I am 75 years old, and not looking for a job, however, I have read David's book and find that I can incorporate his suggestions into my every day life. It is inspiring, uplifting,encouraging, prodding and gives you an excellent blue print for facing any difficulty in your life. The book is easy reading, making you want to reread it to make sure you have not overlooked something. David has put into words, what we all know, but sometimes do not practice, that when we depend on HIM, He has a plan and with our help and HIS guidance, we can accomplish anything. I think the book is an excellent tool in proceeding to find a job, and have given it to several friends who agree that it is most helpful."
5,This is the super-combo value meal for your career search!,"Encouraging, results-oriented, God-focused. I love this book!First, I used the principles Dave has documented in this book to find my current job. The methods are simple, but the vast majority of my job-seeking competitors fell into the same old ruts that have been ineffective for years. From the resume to interview follow up, the tips got me noticed and gave me a little something extra that put me over the top.Secondly, and most importantly, this book deals with the emotional and spiritual aspects of losing a job, being restless in a job, searching for a new job, and being turned down. I was comforted by understanding that my job is not who I am and that God is there with me as demonstrated in the scriptures that support each segment of the book."
5,David Rawles gets it right,This is the best book I've ever read related to finding a job. As an empolyeer I found the insights particularly helpful in making sure my staff are in the right jobs and they are doing what they love to do. The principles in this book are time tested and clearly articulated with good advice for the person just entering the job market or a seasoned professional. This book is worth at double the price.
5,Finding A Job God's Way,"""These pages offer practical and concise guidance. Drawing on three decades of experience and the straight edge of God's Word, David charts a clear course for those seeking to know the satisfaction of work done 'as unto the Lord.'"" Steven D. McMurtry, M.D."
5,Packed with Gems of Useful Information,"I have read lots of job search strategy books and this is simply one of the best I have come across. Very focused, practical, real-world suggestions, along with an informed Christian perspective on the difficulties facing the job seeker. An easy and substantive read. This valuable book is severely underpriced for all the insider knowledge the author conveys."
1,"You don't need ""God"": You need to critically examine your life. . .","Notice all these 5-stars are from Texas? No surprise there; I imagine all these good-ole folks want a job so they can afford their gas-guzzling SUVs and keep up with the Joneses in their McMansions. I would add most of them haven't reviewed anything else on Amazon: friends of the author? Paid? Perhaps the author himself with various nom de plumes?You don't need to pray for a job: with a little hard work, determination, and an unwavering tenacious attitude, you'll be able to fulfill your earthly needs. IT'S CALLED ENLIGHTMENT; HUMANISM: stop your ignorant blathering, people.God's dead.Don't waste time with this yahoo book . . . just go out there and apply yourself; fight for the poor and down-trodden. Fight for a clean environment and give peace a chance.And remember . . . Jesus rode a donkey not a corporate jet. He understood that it takes a village . . . not self-help drivel from a con-artist."
5,Finding A Job - A Great Resource,"With the economy slow and loss of jobs in the IT/Telecom industries, this book was great timing by Rawles. It is an insight for those of us who thought finding a job in today's time was almost impossible. Cheers to David for writing such an inspirational book - my professional group has purchased several and given them to our ""career-lost"" colleagues."
4,Love It,I did not check the size before I got it and thought it would have been a bit bigger. My husband and I are huge LOST fans and love it.
5,Vise & knob Assembly,"this is a great produce to have with the miter saw for many reasons , when cuting a 45% cut it help to hold your piece tight to the saw with long pieces ."
2,Too Fast for Me,"The tempo of this performance is so quick it is stressful to listen to. I have another performance, done at a slower pace, that I love."
2,BEWARE,"The songs are by the original artists, but they are not what you heard on the radio! Some are as good or better that the originals, but not many. I thought I was getting the tunes (as recorded) that were hits. I'm disappointed!"
2,Better than nothing,"The rear wheels are cheap, fairly small and don't turn very well. The plastic knobs to lock the rear wheels are also cheap, a bit hard to turn, and will probably wear out soon. The front wheel's caster hardware is also flimsy and 2 of the 4 carriage bolts broke off during assembly while I was tightening them.Keep in mind that this is a tricycle design. As such it teeters a little so be careful not to apply too much horizontal force. Also, the front wheel is a caster type roller and even though you can keep it from rolling, you can't prevent it from twisting.This base is only worth half the price being asked for it and I recommend it only if you cannot find an alternative."
4,rolling along,Great price and everything was as expected. If you need the best in Mobile bases then HTC is the best.
4,Detroit's Polonia in review,The pictures in this book give a fabulous idea of how and where our Polonia lived in Detroit. I was fascinated to find pictures taken on the street where our ancester's also lived.
1,Not as good as other Thriller Videos,"This movie is just plain bad. More like the plot and action of that Halloween movie of that Charlie Brown show. But I'm not saying that Charlie Brown and the Great Pumpkin is bad, just that's a comedy cartoon of Halloween. This is the category ""Action Horror"". So I'm just a little surprised. You don't have to watch it, and you'll be glad."
2,low quality blu-ray contents,"This movie, together with ""yellow stone"", ""American eagle"", is pre-mastered at lowest quality. This is the worst picture quality among all the blu-ray movies I have seen. I bought all three movies for video quality testing, but this quality just didn't work for me. QUESTART obviously does not know how to produce high quality blu-ray movies. This scenic contents appear to be blurry, grainy, and it does not appear to have native 1080p resolution. I give it two stars for the contents itself, but overall for the quality, video is not properly encoded ... low bit rate, wrong frame rate, it is all messed up. I only paid $7 but still feel money wasted."
3,Some beautiful footage but extremely boring for the most part,"I have always been interested in visiting Alaska and Hawaii so I decided to purchase this Blu-Ray. There is some gorgeous footage of glaciers, volcanoes, huge waterfalls and black sand beaches. However most of this Blu-Ray is extremely boring footage of wildlife & nature trails. I found myself starting to fall asleep half way through it. It reminded me of some of the boring stuff that we would have to watch in High School Science class. You might find this Blu-Ray useful if you are planning a vacation to Alaska or Hawaii, other than that I can't see how anyone would enjoy watching this.Blu-Ray SpecsHigh Definition 1080pAspect Ratio: 16x9Audio: 5.1 Surround SoundLength: 100 minutes"
4,Interesting...,"I really did enjoy this book. At first, it was a little slow, but, then it began to pick up and I could not put it down. This book is about falling in love, but, loving the right person. Sometimes in life, we put obstacles in our own paths which makes it hard for us to the forest for the trees which is sad. Two people whom really loved each other, but, 1 person mad a choice earlier in life that affected his future. The future has a past and we all need to remember that. The ending was sad, Mr. Man not being man enoug to break off the relationship pulled a disappering act, but, life goes on... All in all, I did enjoy this book and Ms. Rice writing. I am going to buy her newest novel ""Reinventing Woman.... Keep up the good work my sista !!"
3,Broken,The marble was broken so I sent it back.I think it would have been fine if not broke.So I got a wooden one
1,"Very, very cheap material","When puchasing halloween costumes I don't expect much.. but I do expect something a little better than this. It's made of the worst, itchiest, wrinkle filled material. There is not an ounce of stretch to the material so it looks like you're wearing a brown paper bag and the sleeves and bottom don't even have a finished edge. So imagine cutting felt like material and then wearing it as a turtleneck."
3,I put in a comment below.,It is a little too sweet. I will probably give it to my daughter. I enjoyed the Lime Citron that vita bath has. This is more my fragrance.
5,Works,Been using Vitabath for years. Had the green (for men I guess). Wife lked the pink (more for ladies I guess. Soooooo...
5,Vitabath Bath & Shower,I have been hunting for this. Hard to find in stores Order and received in a very short. Will order again Last way over a year
1,Awful smell,"I normally place a great deal of importance on fellow Amazon users' reviews, which led me to purchase Vitabath after seeing the glowing comments.When I received the bottle in the mail, the first thing I noticed was a faintly nauseating scent coming from the body wash even before I opened it. Once I squirted out a small amount to use, the smell was overwhelming. It lingered in my shower even when I wasn't using it. The smell was so strong and nauseating, I eventually had to throw out my exfoliating sponge as I could smell it everytime I held it to my face.For many, it appears to get the job done. For me, the smell was so nauseating I had to throw out the entire bottle.Also, after I showered it felt like there was a filmy residue left on my skin that made me feel like taking a second shower.Buyer beware, this body wash is a 'your mileage may vary' experience."
5,Expeditious Service,I was so satisfied with the efficiency of your company. I received my products well before the date it was promised.
4,"Excellent book, but missing many films.","Disappointed to find many films not included in this book. I'm not referring to recent movies; this is to be expected. Hoping to use this to reference and record classic films I've enjoyed, this book has unexpected gaps. Perhaps I should create a personal journal and not assume writers of this kind of book would consider most old movies are ""classic""."
5,Brilliant Buy!,"While the builders in Georgia are finishing my FIRST home, I decided to check this book out. I must say it is a gamble well worth taking if you have never purchased a design book, or don't have a clue what you want to do with your rooms. The photos are brilliant and the styles are quite eye-catching. What I liked must was the approach the author took at explaining colors and how to work with various colors, patterns and fabrics. Most importantly it is written in layman's terms. While it does not explain how to get various painting techniques, this book contains color wheels and explains how to use them to get the most out of your ideas. Still, if you don't have an idea or a clue you certainly will find several which cater to different personalities and themes. Finally this book helps you to make each room have a soul and spirit of its own. I say, go for it!"
5,Trace Bizet,"As Johnson noted in the booklet, only a singer like Ann Murrey can handle these melodies. They stretch from the very bottom to the very high, both in pitch and mood and style. Bizet is a born melody maker, as these songs confirm. But we can easily learn in these melodies that Bizet's style are not fully mature yet, althogh some melodies ranked among the masterpieces. Through these melodies we can understand that after these experiments how Bizet gradually reached his great ""Carmen""---a very wonderful listening experience. Here Murrey's voice as well as Johnson's piano are clear and exuberant, their intepretation are well enough. All six melodies of ""Feuiles d'album"" are excellent, especially ""Le grillon"". Other memorable ones are ""Berceuse"", ""Pastorale"". My only dissatisfied one is ""Adieux de l'hotesse arabe"", with too much contemplation."
3,cabinet pull,"This is a nice looking pull for the money, however we have decided to get the Oil Rub Bronze without the highlight."
1,You can find a better book,"Not one of the best books I've ever had to read, was assigned for a class and was sold back ASAP. I want my money back. Minus 1 star"
3,ridiculously funny,"the people in this book are so pathetic and brainless, but I couldn't put it down for some reason. Something about the book draws me to it. Maybe it's becasue of the way the author had written it? there was so many solutions to coming up with caring for a pet or egg that week, but alex did a lot of stupid things that could have esaily been avoided! why not just BS the whole project if she didn't want to carry the egg around? exactly!"
1,Classical Music Lover,"Although I love classical music, this CD was awful. I guess I had expected more. It wasn't the CD's fault."
2,Very Redundant,"I bought this album for one piece, that being track number four. After I listened through the entire thing I found that I only liked tracks four and five, and after listening to those a two more times, I became very annoyed.For those of you who don't know, La Folia is just a piece with the same repeating pattern. These patterns go on for one hour with this CD and become boring and annoying.Tracks number four and five are really the only decent tracks on this album.Don't become dissapointed with this CD like I did."
2,Does not work with Droid,"Won't charge my Motorola Droid, though its output power rating is higher than the Motorola-branded version of this that came with the phone. Not sure why it won't work. The claim on the package that it works with all USB-charged devices is clearly false, as I'm not the only commenter to find something it would not charge.It does, however, charge my TomTom Go 720, so I know it works."
2,Doesn't Work With iPod nano,"Bought this to charge 3rd gen iPod nano...turns out that it doesn't work with it despite having all the same attributes (input watt/volt/amp, output watt/volt/amp) as one I already had. Also wouldn't charge 4th gen iPod nano. Worked on a cell phone I had laying around, so I didn't give it 0 stars. Essentially useless for what I bought it for though. If you intend to use this for iPods, I'd recommend finding another product."
5,Excellent alternative for USB power,The adapter was easy to use right out of the box. I had not problems with it and it worked much like any other power adapter.
1,Didn't Work on iPhone or Kindle,"That's it. Don't know if it's defective or, as with other reviews, it mysteriously simply doesn't work with these devices. The indicator light on the unit, which is green when not plugged it, is red when plugged in. The iPhone does't show that it is connected to house current when plugged it. Returning for refund."
5,The final touch,"For the past couple of years, I have been purchasing the tools needed to convert my half of the garage into a wood shop. Each weekend it seemed like I spent about an hour each day cleaning up until I finally took the plunge and ordered this dust collector. I must say that I am extremely pleased with it's performance. It is so quiet that you can leavi it running while you talk to people in the garage. I could never have done this with my shop vac. It has plenty of power for any of my woodworking machines. My only complaint is the steel band that connects the bags to the collector. There has got to be an easier way. When I find out, I'll let you know. Highly recommended."
3,Useful but just part of a system for good results,"I have decided to take the really small trouble to move the hose from tool to tool, since it is just me there and I have organized the major tools (table saw, planer, jointer) so they have their rear ends facing the same direction. This seems to work fine. The 4"" hose is easy to move and slip onto each tool when I am going to use it, even for a few cuts.I have added a garbage can pre-collector, so it is a 2-stage system. It is imperfect, even with lots of duct tape, but I am satisfied with the system so far. Maybe because I have been around a while and know things never work as well as illustrated in the catalogs and magazines. It is a GREAT improvement over what I had before (broom and shop vac). I got a Shaker 1 micron bag (on sale at Rockler in January) for the Jet and that seems to be a major improvement. Also I am adding a small Lee Valley air cleaner to snarf up the ambient fine stuff."
4,Jet DC -650,"I am retiring soon and have been slowly adding tools for my workshop. This dust collection system should be a priority for anyone who enjoys woodworking. It is very efficient and surprisingly quiet! I have utilized blast gates, etc. to hook it up to my band saw and table saw. Works great. Was easy to assemble aside from the metal bands which were shipped incorrectly assembled and I had to fiqure out the spring latch system.Once corrected they work well. Even my wife likes it as the sawdust now has been significantly reduced thus making the workshop a cleaner and healthier environment.A must buy!"
3,Crick in the neck - Engineers rarely use their own products,"I bought this for a one person shop. My original intent was to have one hose and pull it to the tool I was using.1st, If you plan to use cheaper hose in a one tool per time system, the fact that the in-feed is on top of the unit, the weight of the hose will crimp thinner hoses.2nd, this sucker does not roll for beans. it has 4 wheels two are fixed and to rotate, if you happen to be pulling in the direction that the rear wheels are pointing (Rarely are you pulling to where you already are) you're good, if not your in trouble.I ran a more permanent system and with blast gates it has plenty of power to run jointers, planers router tables. Just myobservations."
3,dusty,"I have owned this machine for 3 years now, apparently since BEFORE they made it easy to empty the lower bag. I find it to be grossly underpowered for most machines especially for the small difference in price to move up to Shop Fox or Grizzly. But if u do buy this unit make sure you upgrade to a minimum of 5 micron bag as the 30 micron bag only stops the chips."
3,JET DC-650/708640,"I bought this Dust Collector just about a year ago. First, I found it almost inpossible to get the standard 30 micron filters to snap in place. On advice from another owner on this forum I purchased a set of 5 micron bags from Penn State Industries to cut down on dust escaping through the filter bags. These bags although they were advertised to fit the DC 650, by the time you got them in place and sealed with the spring loaded 20"" retaining clips you end up with bunched up pleats which allow dust to escape through. The DC 650 does work well to collect the saw dust produced while sanding on my Powermatic 2442 lathe but I think there are better designed collectors out there that for a few more dollars wouldn't have these design deficiencies."
5,Pleasent Addition,"Cruisin with power tools. One can never have enough. Forgot about how important it was to control the dust(MDF) stands for ""man-made dust factory"". Although I could have used a larger unit, I can only use one machine at a time. It has got to be better than a shop vac. It is definitely a whole lot queiter. Static pressure is lower but volume is tremendously greater. I might be able to find what is left of my basement yet! If you love wood, than get one of these before you change your mind because of the dust."
5,Workhorse for home shop,"This was the second ever Jet tool I bought about two years ago. It had been serving my home shop very well. I have not had any problem with it whats-so-ever. It always starts when I need it. I had couple of times the dust was up to the neck and this thing was still going. It is pretty powerful for its size and that class of dust colloectors as I understand. I made my own 5 micron bag and plan on making a bigger lower bag or add a ""window"" to it. My shop is 10'X12' and this thing does not take much of room. So it's recommended if you have a small shop and don't run more than one tool at a time."
2,Caveat emptor,"I bought this item. I returned it the first time because the shipping insulation did not protect the dust collector from damage. There was minor damage on the second compressor but I was able to assemble it only to discover that the fan in the housing rubbed the motor creating a winning noise. Jet was willing to ship a new fan or provide a list of warranty repair vendors. I decided to ship it back [...]. Yes, even with the friction rubbing against the motor it had power. No, it's not mobile. The wheels on the base restrict the compressors movement. Before you buy checkout the Delta Shop Master Model AP400."
1,DC-650 JET DUST COLLECTOR M-708621,"I bought mine 10/17/03 and have used it at the most 30 minutes because it has very little suction. When I contacted the JET TOOL DOCTOR for help on 09/29/04, was told that they were not designed to pick up the small dust produced by my table sander [really?]. I have replaced it with a 30 year old CRAFTMANS shop vac that works much better, so for now it is the most useless tool in my shop including the broken hand sanders."
3,Damaged pages,"Lovely little book. Unfortunately,3 of the pages had minor damage due to printing flaws.one looked like a drop of water had spilled on it. It was a Christmas gift so had no time to return and exchange for another. Still,a great book!"
5,Makes a great gift for your sister.,I purchased this for my sister's birthday.I had to read it first and loved the photoswith the attached sentiments. This makesa good gift from sister to sister.
5,Very Good,"The book was smaller than expected, but it is way better than those other ""sisters"" books. This one has many more truisms that everyone can relate to and not too much mush. My sister loved it for her birthday."
4,Just sister book,I liked the pictures and the captions that went along with it. For the price it is good quality and I would order this again
5,Just sisters cute book,I just gave it to my sister for Christmas tonight. She thought it was a riot.It's fun to find different theme for sisters. Thank you
5,GREAT Book!,"This is a great book and seller shipped it extra speedy, which was much needed for my college course ASAP. Thank you to the seller, great seller and I highly recommend!"
4,Music education textbook,This book deals with the concepts of why music should be taught in the public schools. The author does an excellent job of making the reader think about why and how music should be taught.
2,Not as Good as I Thought It Would Be,"This album is not a good one for folks just getting into - or wanting to get into - Hawkwind's music. The quality of the live tracks is abysmal. I found the only good part of the two CD set to be the additional material at the end from ""Xenon Codex"" and ""Electric Teepee"". Find another anthology to get the full scope of their music."
1,Product is getting worse and worse,"This used to be a good product, but as of August 2011 it is no longer. Slowly the company has been skimping on the amount of actual lime oil used in the product -- now so little is used that it hardly has any odor at all, and smells instead like linseed oil, rendering it all but useless as a deodorizer. I don't think I'll be buying any more of this company's products. Currently, the tops of the cans don't even match the bottoms -- a sure sign that the company is focusing on skimping and on maximizing profits rather than on producing a good product."
1,Didn't fit!,"I bought one of these for my jet saw (JTAS-10XL) and it was too big- Only .015"" wider than the opening- but wider is wider. It is .03"" wider than the original throat plate, which fits perfectly."
2,Too many pieces,"We gave this to our 2-year old grandson for Christmas, & he seemed enthused by it. BUT, the tracks are very wobbly and come apart far too easily, especially the sections that are elevated. We glued the trees together, otherwise he would have just kept knocking them over and they fall apart far too easily, so they would have become lost. The train magnets are only strong enough to maintain 3 cars together. I guess only time will tell how much he will play with it, but we think overall, it will cause frustration. Perhaps if the tracks were just flat on the table, it would have been better."
3,air freshener,Works well as long as the can runs out. It is set to automatically spray every 15 minutes. There's no long lasting odor control.
2,Still Very Outdated,"Perhaps it is because Mongolia is changing so fast (individual visas were only issued from 1 June 1997) but this book is one of Lonely Planet's worst - and that's sad because Mongolia is a fantastic country. For example, almost all the backbacker accommodations mentioned in the UB section have closed down, and it doesn't mention Gana's Guest House which is the only place to stay if you're on a budget. Also, it underestimates the travel times between different towns, and makes some of them sound quite big when in fact they are tiny. But don't wait for a new edition - go to Mongolia before it changes!"
1,The very worst Lonely Planet book I've ever used,"Very old information, not well researched, and crudely written. New researchers were in Mongolia working on a new edition this summer, but from what I heard from those that met them, it won't be much better. Two males again, short amount of time in the country, and not very comprehensive visits."
1,leave the book at home,"If you take the words of a ""travelor"" who seems to get the info from a bar room chat in UB, without wanting to actually go anywhere, then this is your man. I have used many other Lonely Planet Guide Books with great success. Obviously this one got by the hands of the quality control forces. If anything good comes of it maybe it will just persuade people not to go there. The country is one of my favourites, so I like to think I'll selfishly enjoy it on my own."
1,Not Happy,"Not happy, I got this copy thinking that it was the unabridged version as nowhere on the web page said any different. It has been cut down so much that you only get three hours worth of audio.misses a great deal of the original story."
3,Australian SF Reader,"An academic and his daughter get caught in a library. This is not so bad, apart from the fact that is currently the site for a fight to the death between the best warriors or several alien races over the leadership of their particular reason.Not being an alien, a warrior, or armed, he only has his knowledge of the territory and his wits to help him survive and to try and keep his kid alive, because he is forced to participate in the contest."
2,"A little far fetched, but a good escape","A little silly, but interesting, I was anxious to see what was gonna happen next. I generally like books a little more realistic, but Reilly is usually a good read."
3,Interesting,"This was a pretty interesting book. I liked the Sci-Fi story and the characters. There is not as much NONSTOP action in this book as with Mr. Reilly's others that I've read so far! Not my fav, but, I do recommend it!"
4,Excellent book. Disppointing format,"i have loved this book ever since i first read it 4 years ago, but i am disappointed in the Kindle version. There are a number of spelling errors and some sentences where the words used just dont make any sense. Add to that the occassional missing sentance where an entire line or two is missing and just a blank section sits on the page.The book itself is an excellent read and full of enough excitement to where you cant put it down."
4,"An intergalactic contest in a library...no, really, that's the plot","Matthew Reilly has established himself as a good writer of techno-thrillers and hyperthrillers. This book offers more of the same in the form of an intergalactic battle to the death in a labrinyth (which is actually the New York Public Library). The aliens and their guides provide much of the action as well as humor. Dr. Stephen Swain, the human chosen to represent his species in the contest, finds himself battling assorted humanoid and reptilian species while trying to keep his young daughter free from harm. It's more slam-bang than, say,the stories of Isaac Asimov, but it's a very good read for a rainy day."
2,No wonder he had to self publish!,"Decided to give Matthew Reilly a go having heard good things about his books - Ice Station and Temple, in particular - and thought I'd start at the beginning. Well, I hope they get better!The premise is great; seven contenders from all the intelligent races in the universe brought together in a ""labyrinth"" to fight it out until only one is left standing. However, the writing in this book is very immature and the author hasn't yet learned how to create true tension that makes you want to turn the pages as quickly as you can. In Contest you know from the very beginning how it will all turn out. There's no character development, but that's not really expected in this type of novel and doesn't generally stop me from enjoying them.Well, hopefully he has improved and I can write a more positive review on Temple."
3,MATTHEW'S FIRST CONTEST!,"Okay, so it's not his best, but it was still entertaining and fun to read. Though it read too much like a comic-book-in-the-making, CONTEST still did not bore me to tears.I like a fast-paced adventure romp, and that's what I got. There's something to be said there!There was some good action and suspence here that made for a fun read.Not as character driven as it should have been, but hey, it's the guy's first novel for crying out loud! Being a writer myself, that's no easy feat. Kudos to him for getting it done and out there.I've read much worse and been bored to tears by so-called - better writers. Even they fail or fall short at times.I for one llok forward to this young man's next endeavor."
3,Fairly silly comic book stuff,"fairly silly comic book stuff which does not make it bad, just know what you are buying. I personally do not care this type of book as it is way too over the top (and I do like good action adventure and thrillers). This is like a comic book on steroids!"
1,This was totally abominable,"I am an easy to please reader...a little suspense, a little gore, a semi-believable plot and I am content. This joke had me totally disenchanted from page one. The plot is so totally CONTRIVED and unsuspenseful it will shock you. Of course everyone who reads this review will discount it as most other reviews are favorable but BELIEVE ME this was awful and I'm trying to save you from wasting your hard earned cash. It's the least I can do."
2,Blech,"What a disappointment despite the praise on review sites - the whole story reads like a badly written Sci-Fi original movie script, complete with predictable outcomes, completely unrealistic situations (yes, it's a sci fi story, but there are still parts that just don't make sense and are just there to move the story along rather than stop to make a point about them), and boring dialogues.At -best-, it's a teenage-written fan fiction on a science fiction site online. Don't bother with this one. I'll be giving this author another chance by visiting the library for his other titles, but I'm not hopeful."
1,Skip this and read the rest,"I realize this was his first book, but had I read it first, then I would have never wasted my money on another. That being said, I would have missed the many hours of enjoyment I have received from most of his other books. The plot and characters in this one wouldn't have made a good comic book."
3,Fast Paced and Fun,"This is my third Matt Reilly novel, and it was exactly what I expected: fast-paced, lots of action, and little character development. While I enjoyed the pace and the in-your-face Sci-Fi storyline, I felt some of the story required a bit too much suspension of belief. Without giving anything away, I found it very difficult to imagine a learned man like the lead character simply taking HOW he got into the library in stride, and then just accepting his situation just as easily. If it weren't for this, I would have given the book 4 stars. Other than this issue, and a few other plot holes, CONTEST was a great way to spend two evenings. If you haven't read any of Reilly's work, then CONTEST is as good a place as any to begin to experience this young author."
3,Obviously Reilly's First Effort ...,"It's obviously Matt Reilly's first effort - this still puts it in a ""more entertaining than most"" action writers category. While written in Australia and updated for the US, the book started off with a few Americanism inconsistencies that jumped out right away - such as what was Holly Swain doing at school on a Sunday during a football game?But, in typical Matt Reilly style, once the initial introductions are over the action (and fun) begins. ""Booya"" to the Hoodaya and Karnadon - verrrry cool.To paraphrase the Bellows of Bellos (wince) ""For those who are about to read Matt Reilly for the first time - I salute you."" You're in for a treat (but be sure to check out Ice Station next - again some suspension of belief necessary, but oh what a pace)!"
3,Contest,Strangely exciting if you like science fiction. One of his earlier books. Great monster aliens with plenty of violence and splatter
4,Worth every penny,"What a great saw! Take advantage of what Jet has to offer here. This is basically a Powermatic saw, for about $[money] less! I have to admit that the legs for my extension table arrived bent from shipping, but the service team at Amazon took care of me and shipped a new pair that arrived within the week. Setup of the saw was fairly easy, if a bit time consuming. Once I got it put together though, it ran very smoothly. Consider ordering a zero-clearance throat plate, I think it's worth the little bit extra you might spend. I've got no bones about this saw, it's really a great tool."
4,JET 10in.Xacta Saw with 50in. Xacta Fence,"The saw was shipped in 6 boxes and was in good shape when it arrived. Assembly was relatively easy, We had a problem with the fence guide rail holes didn't match up on the front rail.Still waiting on a response from Tool Crib and JET. Everything else went very well. I give this saw 4 stars for the good quality workmanship and it went together like a dream, good assembly directions but need to be read more than once or twice to understand. Illustrations would be nice.Would be a 5 star saw but with the problem with saw it can't be."
1,junk motors,"the motor is junk. less than three years with light use, two run capacitors it funally quit working. no other motor fits. Ok I will buy one from jet what other choice do I have. The next problem is a new motor is 6 weeks on back order. Must be going through a lot of them. I cant wait to much business will be lost. so i took the leeson motor off my planer made an adapter plate at the local welding shop and reamed the pulley to fit the leeson motor. LASTJET TOOL I OR ANY ONE I KNOW WILL EVER BUY"
5,I love my Jet table saw!,"I have been using my Jet left tilt table saw for about a year now. I love it. One of the best shop investments that I have made.I paid the extra 25.00 for the fed ex delivery. Highly recommended. It was worth it. The fit and finish were beautiful. I spent about three hours putting the saw together. The only snag I hit was that one of the holes on the front fence guide bar did not line up. I drilled and tapped a new one. also the front corners on the cast iron wings were sharp. I filed those down to avoid digging into a piece of priemo wood. The saw is quiet and runs exceptionally smooth.I bought the thee pack of freud blades and also the 8"" super dato cutter by freud. I have not found any thing that I cannot cut, rip, or dato. I primarily keep the combination blade installed for most applications.I would highly recommend this saw to anyone interested. It is a real work horse!"
4,Great Saw - slow parts replacement,"I purchased this saw mid-December. It arrived within a week and the saw looked great. Very little assembly required. The rails were damaged, looked like a forklift had driven over them and flattened one end. Called Amazon and they said they'd ship new rails from the Jet factory within 7-10 working days. That was more than a month ago. So, I can crosscut, but no fence yet. The saw deserves 5 stars; poor parts replacement drops it to 4 stars. Fit and finish are excellent; quality is obvious with every part of the saw. I would buy again in a heartbeat, but probably from a local dealer so I can pick it up myself."
5,Rick is really rocking!,"Mr. Rick Randlett has out done himself with this new album. My favorite cut off the new album has to be ""Party on the Bayou"". This is a real upbeat, well written, and excellently performed song! Every artist should have the ability to write such great songs and record them. Rick, hope your writting some great songs for the next album!"
3,Hmmm,"I can see those long lean fingers playing the frets...I can feel the passion in the lyric...Mr. Randlett's strength is in the instrument he holds in his hands. His voice is better suited for a Beach Boy harmony, or a Christmas choir; however, his guitar speaks the blues that he cannot sing. I am not convinced that he feels what he sings. Those who sing the best blues have also experienced the same. Even Eric Clapton, as a gifted musician, has a ""problem"" convincing me that he ""feels"" it. Perhaps I have discriminating tastes. If I was in a position to make suggestions, I would encourage Rick to play...and let his fingers do the singing. Since I am not in that position, I would still like to say that I enjoyed the CD, but I know that Rick is capable of more. Also, I really like the Beach Boys and Buddy Guy and Toby Keith and Norah Jones and Outkast and Matchbox 20 and the German band that comes to south Florida every year for Octoberfest. Chicken dance!!! It's all in the mood---like the blues."
5,All Alone,All great music should make you want to do something. And this album makes me want to dance. . .and cry. . .and sing the blues. Great work!
3,Lex Barker & Brad Harris,"I bought this film because Lex Barker was a decent actor & if that cheap producer of the Tarzan films would have read any of the Tarzan novels by ERB (as Lex Barker had done.)Well we would have seen a really good set of Tarzan films.So what's the above to do with Lex in ""Spy today, Die tomorrow"" you might wonder?This film shows you a side that Lex could've played in Tarzan. Lord Greystoke/Tarzan was at one point a French secret service man. Read the ERB books & enjoy the fun & excitement.""Spy today Die tomorrow"" Shows Lex having fun in this part & teaming up with Brad Harris (who is STILL in top bodybuilding shape.) Is just a nice little romp of a spy flick from the 1960's.Not an earth shaker but a simple action film with a little charm."
2,"Yawn Today, Snooze Tomorrow","Not a great print, washed out color and a lot of scratches - which beyond the obvious downgrade in experience, also makes it harder to follow the plot and keep the characters straight. But it turns out not that great a movie either, from a story construction or technical viewpoint. Even for eurospy this is a B-movie: in some fights, you can literally see the punches not connect. Some witty one-liners are interspersed, though it's truly odd how they keep saying ""Die Slowly, You'll Enjoy It More."" Isn't that what sadistic villains say? I enjoyed the ending twist, though.Still, thanks to Sinister for making it available, because it hasn't been released anywhere else!"
4,A cheaper version of Nike One,"The Nike One balls are tremendous, but if you play a lot of golf, and don't like spending $45 per dozen, this is a good alternative. Good distance, soft feel, and great on or around the green. I have a lot of club head speed, so I like a softer ball that lessens the feeling at impact. I would not recommend this ball for players that like to ""let the club do all the work,""All I know is that the first 2 shots I hit with the Power Soft ball were a GIR to a 180-yard par 3 and a subsequent birdie. Can't argue with that.Also, I prefer Nike balls in general because I don't like trying to line up the ball's logo with where I'm hitting it. Many people like that, but I prefer a ball that has a non-linear logo, and Nike (the swoosh) fits the bill. I know, it's a psychological thing, but, hey, it's golf. It's ALL psychological anyway. Bottom line: Good ball, good price."
3,$59.95 for THIS??,"I was very excited to receive this book for my Pali studies, as I had been putting of purchasing it due to the price. It wasn't until I received a gift card in for the holidays that I decided to buy it. Given the purchase price I anticipated a sort of large tome with sutta's in it alongside translations and interpretations. I was shocked when I opened the package to see what was practically a pamphlet of a book, no bigger than Thomas Paine's ""Common Sense"".It must have cost no more that a dollar or two to print a book this size. I feel scammed having paid so much for it.That being said, what content it does have is useful."
4,"A bit pricey, but...","This book is a dual-language English/Pali book with some of the basic teachings. In addition to that, it explains the translation word by word and has a pronunciation guide as well. It's really handy, though I would not recommend it as a sole text for a beginning student of Pali. The book was pretty thin (and softback) for the price, which is why I took off a star."
1,Wrong Part please read,"The part that is pictured as of October 1 2010 is ACTUALLY 903983 (as stamped on the actual part in enlarged picture) I ordered this part number 904905 and received the Rubber Mount that fits on the metal plate, I ordered the Moog K90241 Macphereson Strut Mount Assembly too and the Monroe 904905 is the EXACT same part (the Monroe looks and feels of better quality to me)so be careful when ordering these parts for your Audi. Amazon is awesome, will be sending me a return ups label and will ship the correct parts 2 day shipping at no cost, ya' gotta love these guys!!"
2,Best of a bad crop,"As an oceanography professor I have used this book in the past and unfortunately use it to this day (at least until I develop my own lab book) and it is honestly the best of a bad crop of oceanography lab books. Of all the lab manuals I have looked at, they fall into two categories: too simple or too complex. This one falls into the latter category. Fortunately, there are enough labs that if you skip some labs and a few specific questions I would consider this manual ""usable"", not great not even good but ""usable"". If your professor requires this book, get it and photocopy the relevant pages to turn in and then sell the book as complete. You'll get more money back."
2,not well written,The lab book needs an errata. There are too many flaws and is not written to the style of the various subjects covered.
1,Feh,"The only reason I got this in all honesty was for my class in Oceanography lab. But the exercises in the book seem to assume that the reader knows more than what the book tells them. Usually a book like this has the answers in the section you read before the exercise, here, that's not the case. You have to find the answers elsewhere. Or make them up and pray the teacher doesn't read it."
2,He has written better books.,"Just finished this book. I have to wonder why he wrote this in the present tense? Most annoying way to read this book! Read like a screen play! For that error alone, I give it a 2. I know he can do better."
5,A MUST READ FOR ANY MARINE ENTHUSIAST!!,"After reading ""MEG"" and ""Trench"", Steve has followed up without missing a beat. As a marine biologist, I am amazed at the realism that Steve incorporates into his fiction novels. I have studied sharks for years, and found his descriptions fascinating. I am looking forward to getting into the ""LOCH"" series when they debut."
3,Is this series losing steam?,"I just finished Steve Alten's latest Meg novel. The book is certainly fast paced and entertaining, but I question whether this series is losing some steam. The plot seemed forced, especially the reality TV aspect. If you enjoy Alten's previous Meg novels or shark books in general, you will enjoy this book. But, it's not really ""new"" material, so don't expect too much."
5,Primal Waters - Meg series gets better with each book!,"Steve Alten has outdone himself yet again with Primal Waters. I could barely put the book down until it was finished (and I was on a 7 day cruise)! He builds on the characters in such a realistic way they are like people you know and you care about them personally. While reading, I often put myself in their place and could ""feel"" their emotions. I am already routing for a fouth book in this series. These are the kind of books great movies are made from. If you like realisim and creativity and suspense you will love all of Steve Alten's books."
2,Who wrote this book?,"I enjoyed the two earlier Meg books, but this one is a puzzler. I'm having a great difficulty reading it. My reasons are as follows:1. It is narrated in the present tense, which makes it difficult to read. Few authors can, or should, attempt this.2. Gross factual errors. I don't remember such cases in the earlier books, but he confuses geology with geography, refers to closer to shore (in the sea) as ""inland"", makes consistent errors in Genus species (Genus is always capilatized; species NEVER is, he keeps reversing it), and equates volcanic eruptions with warming climates, when the reverse is true.It is also sloppily written/edited, to the point that I can no longer believe the same author wrote this and the two previous books.Well, I'll try to slog through some more, but it sure is slow, and painful, going!PeglegI decided to edit this review, and drop my rating from 2 stars to zero. A total disappointment!"
2,"Boring, Boring, Boring, Boring",Most of the reviews are good and that's puzzling the heck out of me. I normally read a good book in a few days but I have been at this one for about two weeks and I am only 2/3 of the way through. I simply can't get into it. Almost nothing of what happens is interesting to me. This Daredevil idea is wholy unrealistic...almost stupide. I feel that way because in the real world a TV show like that where people risk their own lives would simply not be allowed to happen. The book is poorly edited and has hundreds and hundreds of misspelled words. There are a few nice moments here and there but on the whole it was very dissapointing...to me anyway
5,Excellent - A Real Page Turner,"I read the entire book on a flight from the east coast to the west and literally didn't feel the time fly!I want to know what 120 foot beast, that feasts on Megs, is still lurking undiscovered in the trench. Marren said that he had been chasing some elusive creature for 8 years... I am hoping we get introduced to this creature in book four (Lochness monster? - haven't read The Loch yet). It will probably eat Angel and leave her pups for book five?There was one disappointing point in this book for me. Who cut the line on the Neptune? Someone on the Neptune is a murderer and it didn't come clean at the end of the book. It could not have been Marren, or his samuri goon, and there is no mention of anyone else in Marren's back pocket. I found that a bit sloppy. Unbelievable stuff - but good reading!When is the movie, Meg, due out?? Can't wait to see it!"
5,meg primal waters,"The book it self was awsome, action, and all the excitement you can handle. The book arrived two days earlier then expected which was great because I was out of material to read. Great shark book, lots and lots of information about the creature's we know very little about. I will continue my business with them, can not wait for Meg night stalkers!!!!!!!! Great job thanks!!!!!!!!"
2,It seems so familiar....,"Oh yes, because its Jaws (helicopter scene), Jaws 3D (theme park), Fear Factor, Deep Blue Sea (lagoon/barbed wire scene), and MTV Gone Wild (Candy girls) all wrapped into one.I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED the Trench, and think the author is an incredible writer, but this book seemed like he threw Meg and The Trench into a can, picked out a bunch of pages, pasted them together, and added some filler.The shark mating scene, the stuff about the Meg and her pups, the Marianas, an evil person bent on getting Jonas to find/be eaten by the Meg, trying to trap Angel in the Lagoon...yeah, I already read that in the last book.As much as I was disappointed by the book, if I win the lottery, I am TOTALLY helping Alten get The Trench on the big screen."
4,Lack of Intensity,"As a sharkaholic, I was disappointed with PRIMAL WATERS. PRIMAL WATERS lacks the intensity of the MEG attacks that MEG and THE TRENCH were noted for.There is one story in Primal Waters that I felt was over the top and not necessary. To me, the MEG attacks do not measure up to the title, PRIMAL WATERS."

It provides a unique perspective along with specific practical tools to help us to move forward.

I highly recommend this pensive metaphysical book.Sigrid Macdonald, Author of Getting Hip and D'Amour Road"
5,"A great book, a great moral","My mother has read my this book sence I was 3 years old. I couldn't understand it when I was small, but the beautiful pictures of water colors brought it to life for me. As a got older a started to understand that it was about a poor man who lived in a small cabin and goes to the rabbi for help. The rabbi teaches him a lesson. THe story shows that you shouldn't take things for grandit, and be happy with what you have. I've loved this story sence I was 3, and still love it at 15."
5,Children loved it!,I read this story to my grandchildren's pre-school and even picked out several children to represent the characters and animals. They laughed but really got the message also!
4,Fascinating programme,"Jeremy West's name will be familiar to many as the leader of His Majesty's Sagbutts and Cornetts and as possibly the world's most well-known exponent of the cornett. We hear him on this CD is a recital-style programme which pits Iberian music against contemporaneous Italian music. The result is a very satisfying collection of works, which are well varied and maintain the listener's attention.While the disc is a delight in itself, I recommend listeners and devotees of this instrument investigate the recordings of Jean Tubery, a recorder player turned cornettist (see especially the Castello disc, In stil moderno). His playing is much more varied in terms of use of vibrato and tonguing and the gestures are much more captivating. Some might say that his style is too idiosyncratic and too dependent on his recorder background, but it does make for a more interesting approach to the cornett."
4,I never read Mark Twain (outside of school) but this honestly blew my mind..,Its hard to see now how controversial Mark Twain was in his day but it is 100% clear in this book. Mark Twain's arguments against religion is as controversial today as it was in his day. So controversial in fact that he asked for the book's release to be held until well after his death & the death of his close family.Wow wow wow.. amazing how timeless this work is.. This seriously made me rethink my view of Twain's work and has impressed me beyond compare..
4,Somewhat perfunctory,"This is a fairly good recording of the St. Matthew Passion, but it is fairly perfunctory, not as heart-felt as, say, the Rilling version. ""You are playing the notes, but not the music"" (Pablo Casals), it seems here, to me at least."
3,"Good movie, cheap package","So the 3 stars is only because in the end, it's an interesting documentary. If the movie was bad i'd give this whole thing zero stars, but it's good so I can't.The problem is the packaging/selling. It's about $20 after shipping, but it's only a FORTY FIVE MINUTE MOVIE. I dunno about you, but if it's half a movie I expect to pay half the price.Also, it's not even a legit DVD press from a factory. It's a burned DVD by amazon with the purple bottom, not silver. You could literally do the same thing at your house with the torrent and a blank DVD and it'd be NO different.So until amazon gets it together, I can't recommend you buy it at this price..."
3,The Trials of Ted Haggard,I found this to be good. I read his wife's book and had a lot of mixed feelings. I just can't understand why people who claim to ge Christian treat a fellow person the way they did to Ted and his family.
5,"This CD is a ""Super Phenomenal Recording!""","Every Paganini Etude in the ""Leslie Howard"" recording is very brilliant in every way. Leslie always produces very bold, rich tone of every note that he plays. It is always very ""Grandios"". When I first listened to this recording, I was very stunned because of the incredible rage and intensity that Leslie Howard was able to produce, while at the same time it sounds as if he has no problem with any type of technical difficulty with any of the Etudes. These pieces are truly one of world's most difficult pieces, but obviously ""The Great Leslie Howard"" has definitely surpassed all of that. Leslie Howard is truly, at least to me, the next ""Real Liszt"" especially mainly since he has learned and recorded every single Liszt piano work that there is. I truly believe that Leslie Howard is one of the greatest pianists' in the world of all of time."
2,Poor technique ruins the music,"Leslie Howard tries really hard to play the early versions of the Paganini etudes on this CD but unfortunately just does not have the technique to pull it off. The playing comes off as slow, clumsy and most of all, unmusical. To get a better idea of what the earlier studies are suppose to sound like under the hands of a great technician, check out Nikolai Petrov's rendition:Nikolai Petrov Plays Works on Themes By Paganini."
3,"technically ok, but not great music","I give Dr. Howard loads of credit that she well-deserves for her extraordinairy feats in the piano world. However, this particular CD, in my opinion, is a poor reflection of Romantic/Dramatic/Emotional Liszt piano music (The disc is complete though!). The music produced in the recording sounds like an above average grad student with excellent technique, but little, strange emotion (very mature, but small in quantity and strange in quality). Try Caroline Oltmanns' recording of the Paganini Etude in E flat Major...then you'll see what I mean when I say Romantic/Dramatic/Emotional Liszt music. In addition, Dr. Oltmanns' interpretation, technically, is far superior as well."
3,Not what I expected,"An excellent travelogue with a visit to the cape itself and a hike up a glacier and a view of the black rock Jack showed Stephen in drifts of furious cloud as they creamed past under reefed sails. But I'd expected video of mountainous seas, so I was somewhat disappointed. Still very interesting."
4,This could have been better,"Being a Jerry Lee Lewis fan means that I own 99% of everything he recorded. So, I may be a little too close to the subject to be helpful about a Greatest Hits disc.Any serious listener simply needs, at the least, everything The Hawk recorded for Sun Records. But, back to these 25 choices. Most are wonderful, so, why are ""Baby Baby Bye Bye"" and ""Love on Broadway"" here?I could name hundreds of superior cuts by Mr. Lewis. A few nominations would be; the single version of ""It'll Be Me""...""That Lucky Old Sun"" (just Jerry and his piano) ""Deep Elem Blues"" or ""I'm On Fire.""Just over a month ago The Ferriday Fireball turned 70. Criminally, this was widely ignored. Do yourself a favor and get some Jery Lee Lewis music in your life."
3,Not GREAT balls of fire!,"I reviewed the names of the songs. They were what I thought that I wanted, but when I listened them at home, the versions of the songs were passive/low key. No GREAT BALLS of FIRE! It was not up-beat music.This will be a recycled gift."
3,Good start - be careful of specs - buy better bags,"I've owned one for 3 years. It is connected via 4inch metal ducts to 6 machines - longest run is about 20 ft. Jet, like Delta and others, overrates CFM, especially thru 4in opening. But it does an adequate job on large particles. As advertised, the JET standard bags are rated for 30 microns. That's way too large for most dust from table saws, sanders, etc. Buy felt bags rated to 5 micron. They cost more, but your lungs will thank you. The bags will still be hard to change unless you add some hangers made of coat hangers.I'd change my intake from the dual 4inch to a single 7 in (converter plate from Oneida and others) and the main ductwork in the shop to 6in. Then, I'd have a 4 star system. By the way, these systems are noisy."
4,Rug Braiding w/Verna,"My 101 yr old grandmother told me about this womans work, I can see why her books are still around. Very out dated, however still very relevent!This is one for my hands on craft library."
1,Annoying at best,"I read this drivle in highschool and gave up around book two.Aside, does anyone else think those five star reviews are all written by the same person?Serriously dude, they are really not that great. Just reading through some of the later chapters can get creepy. Hubberd was a very strange man."
2,Satire or Cruelty?,"While reading this volume, I was struck by the thought that Hubbard's so-called 'epic satire' isn't satire at all. See, in order for satire to work, it has to be grounded in truth. Otherwise it's just an absurd claim that makes one scratch one's head rather than laugh. This volume is filled with these head-scratchers.Apparently Hubbard's idea of satire is saying things like, 'All Turks have 'Bey' following their name.' That borders on racism. Or take Hubbard's assertion that all government officers are corrupt and that the IRS is evil. Sure there are some segments of society that believe these two things, but they're idiots. Truth dictates that neither of the above precepts are true, ruining Hubbard's attempt at satire.It's a fairly interesting story. Nothing to write home about."
1,Its no Battlefield Earth,"After reading Hubbard's masterful work Battlefield Earth, I made the wrong decision and tackled the decology. The characters in this series are predictable and boring. It not only takes a long time to read this series, it costs a lot of money. I think Hubbard set aside Scientology and focused on Capitalism for this one. Trust me, you will be better off not having read this jibberish."
2,Black Genesis,"""Black Genesis"" is the second volume in the ""Mission Earth"" series, and unlike the first volume, ""The Invaders Plan"", it actually takes place on Earth.Soltan Gris, our narrator, is even more cynical than before. But the so-called ""satire"" really consists of rants against the government and psychology and is tiresome instead of funny.The pace is not as slow as in ""The Invaders Plan""; this book is about 150 pages shorter. But it still feels slow and lacking direction; the story doesn't really seem to be going anywhere. If I hadn't already bought all ten volumes, I don't think I would bother to continue reading the ""Mission Earth"" series."
2,Disappointed...,"I got sucked into the Mission Earth series after reading the spectacular ""Battlefield Earth"" (the best pulp scifi novel ever). Unfortunately, after buying in hardback all 10 of these bloated episodes, hoping that they would lead to a great ending, I was sorely disappointed.While the stories do have some of Hubbard's humor and some interesting satire, they don't have the cohesion, pacing or the characters of Battlefield Earth. It's not worth your time.(Note, those dust-jackets however have to be the most spectacular ever made.)"
3,Not as good as The Invader's Plan,"Well, I really liked The Invader's Plan, but Black Genesis just isn't as good as the first book. I know it is a work of fiction, but the way Heller is treated by the mafia is too unbelievable even for a sci-fi book. The funniest part of the book was Soltan blowing away a canary with a shotgun. Well, on to The Enemy Within...I hope it's better than Black Genesis."
3,Not the series,"I thought this was a collection of the full episodes of the TV series, but instead it seems to be two long movies patched together from the episodes. Funny, but not as good."
5,Atkins works for me,"This book and diet are very easy to follow. I actually no longer feel I am on a diet. It is a permanent way of changing the way I eat and think about food. I started Atkins in March of 2003 and have lost and maintained 30 pounds. The hardest part is changing your mind set on carbs vs. fat. Also counting carbs instead of calories and not worrying about fat. This way of eating and exercising too has sped up my stalled out metabolism and I feel fabulous! Once you get on your way to losing weight you can add in carbs as you go and see what works. An occasional roll or bite of candy is fine for me now. I eat what I want during the holidays and maybe gain a pound or two, but lose it quickly within a few days. Try it and give it a fair chance. If you like meat and cheese it is the easiest way to lose weight. Good luck!"
3,A book that puts you right into the action,"I tried Atkins Diet for two weeks with good results of weight loss. But I realized that I cannot have the strong will required to maintain it. I went back to NORMAL food. Soon, I gained it all faster than I lost. In fact I am sceptical about trying any other diets that are strictly focused on losing weight."
4,Delivery on-time,"Not sure about the book contents. That is all down to opinion. Did not try this slimming method after looking at the book.Delivery was on time, thanks."
2,Just as Punishing & Unrealistic as Low Fat Diet,"Like a lot of 30-something American males, I have 20 pounds to lose. Even though I work out five days a week, I still can't seem to take it off, mainly because I tend to overeat at meals and give in to junk food too often.I tried this diet and it didn't work for me...I made it five days. Mentally, I felt like a thick fog had come over me. I literally couldn't think or concentrate at all.At the gym, I had no energy to lift or run on the treadmill. I usually run three miles, but after five days on Atkins, I couldn't even make it a half-mile without exhaustion.So for me it's back to basics. Three reasonable-sized meals a day, counting calories and hitting the gym hard. And no snacks in between. Yes, it's painful, but not as painful as this diet, at least for me.And good luck to everyone in 2004 on their weight goals, no matter what method or diet you use!"
2,"I lost 20 pounds, but felt terrible.","He's on to something, but not quite there yet. I lost 20 pounds, but felt terrible.Dr. Atkins outlines his diet featuring no carbs, but as much fat as you want. I ended up eating a pound of bacon for breakfast, and decided this wasn't such a good idea. I recommend you go see a dietician instead. Of course, it COULD work for you.The book takes a simple idea and repeats it over and over again, until you are convinced it will work for you. Not a great read, but I guess that is not the point."
4,A good book,"This is the second week I am on the Atkins and right now I would not trade it for any other diet. I am losing the weight slowly but I need to exercise more and I need to control this darn ""sweet tooth"", for chocolate which is a no-no. Dr. Atkins give helpful tips on what you should do. I have not done the induction at all though, maybe if I had the money and the time to cook all those things :0)"
1,Not persuasive,"My sense of innate logic finds the whole ""carb-watching"" movement to be unfounded; something that sprang into life on 1 January 2004 and won't seem to go away. I've lost 50 pounds over the last 2 years, simply because my life became less difficult and I was not heading to the comfort cuisine like I used to. But hey, this is a free country, and I'm sure the endocrinologists are licking their chops in anticipation of their future growing case-loads, while folks lick their own chops over big plates of bun-less burgers. I would be investing now in health care providers that will need to send out diabetic supplies and pacemakers by the truckload. I am old enough to remember ""liquid protein"". Alas, there is nothing new under the sun."
3,Revolutionary concept but dieters beware,"No one mentions that Dr. Atkins had a history of heart problems and was very overweight when he died. His diet is a classic but it's very easy for people to abuse by staying on it for an extended length of time. The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine does not recommend this diet. I think the South Beach diet, written by a cardiologist, is much safer."
1,This is disgusting,"This was written by someone who cared nothing about long term effects, or overall health---just in how fat his pocketbook became.I'm appalled over how popular this has become--You can't go anywhere without seeing Adkins propaganda. Sure, people lose weight while they're on this, but they're so unhealthy. People who are on this ""diet"" for extended periods of time look sick. They're all red, and their blood pressure must be through the roof.I can't wait until this ends, like all of the other fad diets."
5,"Healthier, more energetic and loosing fat fast !!!","I started Atkins way of eating a month ago. I am 178 cm (5.8 ft)I was 106 kg (234 pounds) when I started. Now, I weigh 96 (211 pounds)and I continue loosing fat everyday. I feel more energetic, healthy. I have had indigestion problems for almost 15 years. Now, all my heartburn, numbness disappeared. I strongly suggest this to anyone who cannot tolerate high carbs. The best thing about this is proably that I have NEVER felt any hunger during this past month (I mean it). I eat all those proteins, fat plus good healthy carbs (lettuce, cucumbers, spinach, tomatoes). Stay away from all bread, pasta, rice, cookies, juices and also high carb veggies and fruits. Take your vitamin supplement daily and enjoy loosing fat every day.. You may feel dizziness in the first 3 days or so, it disapperaed in a few days. I plan to continue this radically till I reach my ideal weight (80 kg) and then stick to low carb eating lifetime.."
3,Carbo Starving! 60 Carbs a day is the lowest,"Hello. I am just reading this book. My flatmate said she has tried this diet over a decade ago with not such great results. She said just after the book was written the ""experts"" came out with a finding that less than 60 carbs a day will result in long term brain affects. After all she points out that your brain works on sugar. No sugar-no brain. It won't really effect your intelligence per say, but it could possible have adverse effects when you get older. You could suffer from Alzheimer's disease and other health related problems. I am still going to give the good doctor a try, because while these things ""may occur"", being over weight is also a health hazard and considering it's more relevant now than later, the risk seems to be just like any other risk; like driving to work or flying on a plane. Good luck to you all. Ps. I will let you all know my findings in the months to come."
3,Good book!!! Nasty foods!!!,"I've studied this book from cover to cover. I have done everything that the book describes. I have lost 5 lbs. in the first week. This book does not seem very healthy! As with all the other comments, I feel very sluggish, tired and have headaches. My heart is trying to pump all the cholestrol through my veins. One thing is for sure, if I keep up with this diet, I'll die of a heart attack! If the author of this book happens to read this, please email me for any information you can pass along that would convince me to stay on this diet because I need to lose the weight."
3,Did the diet for 2 weeks,"I followed the diet for 2 weeks and didn't lose any weight. I must be doing something wrong. Perhaps I slipped with a little sugar and/or carbs. Never went into ketosis. I do miss fruit and carbs. I also bought most of the supplements (not all, too expensive, but I found some contradictions with the dosages in different chapters of the book. However, with all the success stories I've heard I'm going to try again and be very strict. On the positive side, I did notice a decrease in appetite. Wish me luck."
1,"A Quick Fix, But How Long Does It Last?","Tried this diet last year, lost 30 pounds, have since gained back 42. Oh yeah, you can get caught up in the hype, and this diet does work - initially. But just how long can you give up pasta, bread, doughnuts, flour, sugars, sodas, fruits, pancakes, french fries, crackers, and the list goes on and on and on. Like the other 7 friends I know who lost weight and have since regained more on this diet, I have gained my weight back also. This is impossible to follow long term. If you're like me and have tried every ""quick fix"" miracle diet out there and think ""maybe this is the one"", don't waste your money. Start examining why it is that you've tried every diet in the world and now you're heavier than ever. Plain and simple - diets don't work! Don't let this one tempt you either! Start eating less and exercising more - that's what I intend to do and I won't be shelling out megabucks on supplements and books to mega-millionaire Atkins doing it!"
2,Ok for some,"My cousin lost 120 lbs on this, but it is just not for me I am not a big meat eater and i need veggies and fruit one thing that people need to do is to drink a lot of water because water retention may make it seem like you are not losing weight despite your efforts, but if you drink a whole bunch of water and exercise as well as diet it will happen remember DRINK WATER"
5,This really works!!,"I was very apprehensive about this diet, but reading the book only encouraged me. I started the diet July 1, 1996 and by September had gone down 2 sizes!! No more low blood sugar problems, a tremendous increase in energy, and no food cravings are just a few of the benefits. I have kept most of it off, and plan on redoing it very soon. It seems to ""love my body"" and I feel terrific while on it."
3,"The diet works, but the book is thin on practical details","My husband and I have tried this diet now for one week. It really works. I've lost five pounds and he's lost 11. I intend to stay with it -- it's definitely do-able.The book is a helpful introduction but it's a little thin on practical advice and menu plans that will carry you through for many weeks. I've scrambled to begin adapting recipes on my own, for lack of a better alternative. I also bought his recipe book, and hope that this helps. It would have been nice if the book had been organized to take you step by step through the phases of the diet (and specifically what you can and cannot eat in each phase, rather than just general explanations) SO, the diet gets five stars, the book only three. (Plus, his shameless self promotional tone in the book was an annoyance and made me wonder if I was being taken in by another diet fad.Dr Atkins may have done himself an disservice here.)"
4,"The ""last"" diet to try!","My husband was referred to an Optifast obesity program by his cardiologist - instead the two us went on the Atkins diet. He has lost 56 pounds in 12 weeks, and dropped his cholesterol 33%. I have much less weight to lose and have lost 30 in 12 weeks. This is the first ""diet"" that we have been on where we do not crave carbohydrates... The meals are delicious and satisfying. The foods we have been restricting; eggs, butter, bacon, sausage for so long are now allowed. We even lived through the holidays and lost weight. This is a plan that we may opt to stay on for ""life."""
5,DOES THIS ONLY WORK WITH TYPE B or O BLOOD TYPE PEOPLE??,"Hi the more I read about this I get confuse I will like to know if it is true that this diet only work for people with blood type B or O, I am AB, has anyone with type A or AB been successfull??PLEASE WRITE ME AT distassi11@hotmail.com Thank you I do not want to lose my time///"
5,This is the best diet ever!!,"I have been doing the Atkins diet for 1.5 weeks now and lost about 6 lbs. I have been eating everything I want except carbs. Things that I would never eat before like bacon and whole fat mayonaise and lots of cheese. My appetite is drastically reduced for the first time in my life. This is so easy it almost seems silly, but it really works!"
3,just getting started/& I am gaining weight!!!,I have started the plan 4 days ago and I am gaining weight!!! what am I doing wrong??? I am wondering if I am supposed to measure the amount of vegetables I eat or are they free??? Please someone talk to me. I want the success you are all getting.
3,"Three stars for book, 5 ***** for the Diet:","I understand those who have failed. Before you leave this amazing WOE, it may be worth your while to visit www.lowcarbfriends.com, visit the messege boards and see for yourself how much support is out there!!!!!!!!"
4,Myth shattering!,"The only problem with this book is that it is so radical it is hard to believe. Our entire lives it has been engrained that fruits and vegatables are the key to a slim body and healthy life. Dr. Atkins say 'NO'. These are the foods that make you immunosupressed and overweight. He says it's fine to eat foods high in saturated fat. Its fine to eat animal protein in large amounts. Can this be right? All I can say is, if you have been trying for years to shed those pounds so you can feel GOOD again, then you should at least try the diet for the first two weeks. You will feel so much better, I think you will never go back to you're old ways of eating."
4,"I read the entire book in one evening, it is a great book.","Everything in this book described me and all diets I've ever been on. I have lost the same 20 lbs at least 5 times in the last 15 years, and keep gaining it back. I've drank the shakes, popped the pills, ate the grapefruit, and slurped the cabbage soup, and still have the weight to loose. My metabolism is so shot out I decided to give Dr Atkins a try, and it is working. After only 15 days I have lost 7 lbs and feel great. I am able to eat more now than I ever have been able to eat on any other diet. I highly recommend his program to anyone with at least 10 lbs to loose."
3,Just Starting,"Today is my first day, I'm 37, 6'2 and weigh 240. I went from 223 to 189, 9 years ago on the nutri-system diet, but I was a slacker and slowly gained it back, not the fault of the diet, but my eating habits. I feel I need structure, not just eat less and exercise. I felt I needed to be told exactly what I can eat, again, not the general just ""eat less"". I did lots of research and settled on this diet. I read the book and read it again, so I could throughly understand the process of what was happening to my body. I have heard the skeptics and value their input, but right now I feel the skeptics are wrong and I'm anxious to find out. I understand that you are to eliminate fruits in the first 14 days, and if this was for a lifetime, sure I would be concerned, but if you read and understand the book, you know that you can add those foods later. I will keep you informed of my progress."
4,Slow Going!,I started this diet on June 28. As of today I have lost 18 pounds! I thought the weight loss would be faster but I weigh less than I would have without it. It's great that you can eat when you are hungry but it does get pretty mundane. There is not a lot of variety in what you get to eat. It does work if you can stick with it.
3,How does this work with PCOS?,I have recently discovered that I probably have PCOS (poly cystic ovarian syndrom) and that it is partially due to high insulin levels. Has anyone with this disease tried the Atkins diet? I am concerned about giving up fruits and veggies since I have also read Fit For Life and believe they are the life force that we need for health.
3,Good starter ..but NOT FOR PERMANENT!!,"I found Dr. Atkins book to be fascinating in explaining how insulin effects the system. His discussions on sugar and carbs and heart disease are scientifically accurate and made me understand what I'd been doing wrong.I went on the diet for 2 weeks and lost 12 lbs immediately. Then I stayed on it for 5 more weeks..AND LOST NOTHING MORE..plus I felt horrible and really missed my vegetables. I was also very frustrated, because there was no one at the Atkins center who would talk to me about what may be going on.I found a different diet which adheres to the same concepts of getting off the sugar and wheat, but by combining food in appropriate ways, I'm able to have lots of fruits and veggies....(by the way, I've discovered in the course of the Atkins diet that I'm allergic to wheat..of all things!) I've lost 10 more lbs on the new less restrictive..and I think HEALTHIER diet..."
3,Fast results but tough to stay on,"After I failed with ""Sugar Busters"" I decided to give Atkins a read. After the first chapter I just kind of ""skimmed"" through the rest of the book and hit the highlights. He basically explains his entire theory in the first few pages, then just ""elaborates"" and shares success stories for the remainer. To his credit, Dr. Atkins does take a more personal approach in the book than some other I have read, which makes it a little more enjoyable to read. Its also written in a way that allows you to flip back and forth and read the chapters out of order without losing anything. There are some good recipes for homemade ice cream, bread, etc. but you really need to purchase the ""atkins bake"" products to make them properly. I found the program does work, but I got sick of eating bacon and eggs everyday. If you can get creative then I recommend giving it a try."
3,Lost weight - but blood pressure went up!,"This book provides great background about the diet and why it works. I have been on the diet for 6 weeks and lost 16 pounds - however my blood pressure has shot through the roof. I am taking a few weeks off the diet to see if the two are related.I definitely encourage people to monitor their blood pressure while on this diet!!UPDATE:After 4 weeks off the diet, my blood pressure is back to normal. The only thing I can think that may have caused the problems with my blood pressure is not getting enough water. I am going to reread the book and go back on the diet...more updates to come."
4,i lost 15 lbs my first week and i feel great,"my first week was so simple i dropped 15 lbs and i couldnt believe it. im at a stopping point right now and im not sure what that could mean but i havent felt better in years. i have so much energy and i sleep better at night! im not as hungry and i dont crave sweets anymore and most of all my menses are so much better, i have no cramps at all. i have really noticed a difference in my health. there are some questions i need answered though . is there any one out there who would be willing to spare some time and chat with me?? i would surely appreciate it thank you tonda smith"
3,Dieting Ain't Everything!,"Dr. Atkins has done dieters a fine service. But for my money, I prefer D.J. Tice's 'Minnesota's Twentieth Century: Stories of Extraordinary Everyday People.' You needn't be from Minnesota (or even know where Minnesota is!) to appreciate these elegantly crafted accounts of lives otherwise little-remembered. The chapter on the Influenza Epidemic of 1918 is alone worth the price of the book. And let us never forget the Duluth lynching of 1920. You've forgotten already? That's why you need this book. Five stars."
1,Don't turn your body into a cemetery,"Eating too much meat will increase the chance of your exposure to hazardous chemicals (used in the meat industries). What we need is to go back to nature and look how other animals are living """"((( THE EAT ONE THING AT THE TIME )))"""" in addition they run to get their food. never seen a lion eating his cooked meat spreading BBQ sauce on it while watching the Game on TV. Atkin diet will turn ur body into a grave yard that stink, don't forget being depressed (Karma never die)"
4,It works for me!,"Having started the induction diet late in July and still watching what I eat according to the book's advice, I've lost 30 lbs. to date. I read the book before starting and reread it as time went on. I've also kept up with the many written articles on the diet as well as those TV programs that also inform about its dangers. I have faith because ""seeing is believing"". Good luck to all of you who are starting on this diet."
4,"So far, so good","I have only done it for a week and I feel Great. I used to have a bagel in the morning and by the time lunch came I was sooo hungry that I would be weak and I would binge on carbo's at lunch time. For the first time in years I feel satisfied after every meal. I am not hungry between meals. I cheated twice this week but was careful to limit the carbos each time. I kinda combined it with the ""Lifespan"" diet those two times and made sure to eat the ""no-no"" foods within an hour. I love salad now, because I can have a dressing on it that tastes good!! So far 3lbs down in one week. No bloating or head aches and I have great energy at 3pm when you usually be coming down from my sugar high lunch and running for an ""energy"" snack (aka-candy bar)."
2,Not For Me...,"F.Y.I.-------- I anxiously went to the bookstore and purchased this book based on all the hype surrounding it. I was very excited when I read the first few chapters and saw myself reflected in the pages. Upon completion of the book, I followed the diet as described to the letter. However one week into the program, I could not get rid of the oily taste in my mouth from all the fats I was eating on a daily basis. At the end of this week I became sick to my stomach from all the excess fat in my diet. I agree this diet probably works well for some people but not all. I spoke with a woman I work with about my problems with this diet and she concurred that she had to quit it for the same reasons."
3,Problems with diet and Atkins center,"I had started the Atkins diet going on almost 3 weeks now. There are positive things with the diet, however, I am now 2 weeks late for my menstrual cycle. (I never go this late, ever) I decided to call the Atkins center, got switched to three different people, and when i finally had the ""professional"" on line, she told me that they aren't trained with the medical aspects! The book says any medical things going on to call them, and I am told this! She told me to go to my gynecologist and explain to him what is going on and that I am on this low carb diet. I am calling my doctor today, but these people are NOT a help at the center what so ever. < Concerned and very skeptical now>"
1,Fad Diet,This is another fad diet. I think it's just easier to eat healthy foods and get regular exercise.
1,This book is definately not for everyone!!!,"I started the diet 5 days ago.I wanted to lose 10 to 15lbs.I felt ok at first, but on the second or third day I started having ""flutters"" in my chest and I felt shakey later. I drank a glass of chocolate milk and I felt fine.Although I did lose a couple pounds, it is not worth risking your health. I STRONGLY advise people to consult your doctor before you start this diet!! It is not for everyone.And as for the book,it was a little confusing because first he would say one thing and then you would read more and it would be opposite of what he said.For example: In the book he says to eat no sugar in any manner,shape,or form;but in reality you can't avoid sugar because every salad dreesing has some sugar in it and so does other items.Don't waste your money on the book. I am now off of the diet and I am just going to watch what I eat and exercise.I think that is the best form of a ""diet""."
1,if i could give a zero i would,not only is the information that dr.atkins sells false but it could also prove harmful to your health due to an increase in blood pH caused by ketoacidosis. If you really want to lose weight you do not need to buy this or any other fad diet book. the secret to weight loss is that there is no secret. weight loss is best acheived by an active lifestyle and balanced eating.
1,This was the worse diet I have ever tried.,"I read Dr. Atkins weight loss book twice. I decided to give it a try. High fat, proteins, no carbos. Within 5 days I was deathly sick and vomiting. I had no energy and was having dizzy spells. My body had went into ketosis (something that sould only be done under a Doctors care in the hospital. Finally ate a bowl of oatmeal and within minutes felt a 100% better. Five days of high fat did nothing towards weight loss but was great towards gaining weight!! I had great pleasure burning this book."
1,Criminally easy way to eat!,"However, the one star is for the way the book is written! It's very unprofessionally put together.That said, I've lost over 50 pounds and plan to stay that way (and continue to lose a bit more) forever, because my eating lifestyle is now one that I can live with. Cutting out refined carbohydrates is easy.... I don't buy into all that ""low carb bread"" garbage. I don't crave replacements for stuff I used to like, that I now look on with disgust.And best of all, I am not biting my nails, counting the minutes and seconds to the next meal!! I am completely satisfied."
3,Worked with metabolism booster supplement.,"I started reading every word of the book as Dr. Atkins instructs. However, it got boring and cumbersome. So, I went right to the pages on which foods were okay and which ones were not. I lived with the book to these pages. After 2 weeks I hadn't lost anything. I don't exercise. I started taking a metabolism boosting supplement and the pounds started falling off. I have also added some carbs back. I am still loosing. Good luck."
1,Forget This fad!,"I guess one sure fire way to become rich in America is to write a new diet book. It's amazing how many new ones come out every year. The fact that these books sell is a testament that americans still want a quick fix to their weight/health problems. Lets face the facts, their is no cure all solution. All these new diet books do is put a different spin on calorie reduction, some books reduce carbs some reduce protein. I went through a period were I read a lot of health/Diet books,the amount of conflicting information will drive you crazy. I think it all boils down to moderation.(not an original idea) Exercise, eat a lot of fruits and veggies watch your fat intake and save your money on any more diet books."
2,Book sent not the edition shown!,"The only reason I purchased this book was because this particular edition (shown) was recommended as better than other editions and this edition is harder to come by.But, what was sent was different."
5,Outstanding,"Wow! 30 pounds in 90 days, never hungry, eating what man is supposed to eat, Cholesterol went from 248 to 151 in 60 days, and triglycerides went from 611 to 223 in 60 days. I am looking better, feeling better, moving better, sleeping better, and eating better then I ever have before. Dr. A., wonderful book, if you have not been able to loose weight on other diets, this one is easy."
4,Thank you for clearing it up,"I sent in a short review, myself, explaining that Dr. Atkins did not have a heart attack (as erroneously stated here by a recent reviewer) but rather an infection in his heart. That review didn't make it on here (at least not yet), so thank you to the people who cleared that up. It is unfortunate when people spread rumors that are untrue and do that kind of damage. Hopefully it won't happen again."
2,Too much marketing,"My wife and I just started the diet and are finding the book confusing at first glance. The structure of the book does not make it easy to quickly refer back to important sections. For example if I wanted to see what the induction diet consisted of it is not easily found. Possibly color coding certain sections would help.Our other complaint would be that the book does not really get heavily into what the diet actually consists of it is more ""Why"" you would want to do the diet. I have already bought the book so I am buying into the why tell me ""what"" I need to do to make it a reality.Sticking to a diet is difficult enough. Doing it with a confusing reference is frustrating. If at all possible I would buy the book and then have someone who tried the diet help you with the content."
5,DO IT NOW,"I've been doing Atkins for almost 20 years. I tell people ""Fat's your friend."". Blood work is always perfect. I walk passed the normal high carb stuff and just say out loud,""Poison"" LOL"
2,Dr. Atkins',Diet books are never easy to read. This is no acception. There are some handy inserts though that are helpful.
5,excellent!- i lost 5lbs. in 3 days!!!!!,"hearing about high protein diets at school, i was a little skeptical, but after reading the Dr. atkins new diet revolution, i know why it works because i see how it's helping me. i've only been doing this for 4 day's and i'm in it for life."
3,A little leary to try this diet...,"I don't know whether or not to try this diet as it completely, or nearly completely eliminates carbohydrates from your diet. Carbo starving may work at first and deliver incredibly fast weight loss results, but what are long term consequences of following this diet, like health troubles...very interesting concept though when he discusses ketosis. Worth a read at least."
4,Losing and Loving It,"I have been on the Atkins' diet now for 5 weeks and have lost 30lbs. I was very skeptical when i first purchased the book, but now very glad that I did. I read the book from cover to cover and still use it as a reference. Very informative and so easy to do. I still have a ways to go but this is the easiest diet I have ever tried and hopefully it will be my last. Try the 14 day induction of this plan...that is long enough to know if this is the diet that can change your life. If anyone would like to share their experiences on this diet or if anyone has any questions regarding the book or diet itself....please email me at the following address...i would love to talk with people about their success too. missyh@surfsouth.com"
5,the best diet there is,I have tried every diet under sun and this is the only one that works. I have been on it for 12 days and I have lost 10lbs. I feel great and I know I can loose the other 40lbs. The first 2 days were very hard for me but I stuck it and here I am with the fat melting away. It is the only diet that works for me.
4,Its all about finding a diet you can stick to,"No one was more skeptical than myself when I read the book and started the program. As an Italian, I couldn't imagine a day without pasta...but it has been worth it. I have been dieting and exercising for years with slow/no results at losing weight. I only needed to lose 10-15 pounds but it meant not having a wardrobe that fit anymore. My boyfriend and I tried it and he lost 14 pounds and I lost 11. I also worked out regularly and just had a fitness test done...I lost 6% body fat which meant all the weight I lost was fat not muscle (or water thank you), my resting heart improved, everything improved...and after the initial sluggish feeling...you actually feel better. I went on vacation like a million bucks and even after a week of eating and drinking we only gained back a couple pounds...I am back and plan to lose 5 more.... The key is finding a diet you can stick to and this one works for me and I feel great."
3,Poor organization but great information,"I find the information in this book very interesting and useful. I have only been on the diet a week and feel better than I have in many years! However, the organization of this book is worse than poor and some of the information is inaccurate and inconsistent. i.e. tomatoe 5 grams, tomatoe 9 grams. One would think that the editor would have suggested a better arrangement of chapters and checked the information from one chapter to another. Other than that the diet seems to be all that is claimed."
5,This really works and I feel great!!,"I've tried all of the diets, and they all left me starving and unsatisfied. This diet runs contrary to what most people would imagine would work. I would never have believed I could eat steak and eggs for breakfast and the foods I really love the most for other meals, and still lose weight...But it's true. I've lost 14 pounds in the last month, my blood pressure went from 140 over 97 to 122 over 72 (taken today), and I stopped having those between meal cravings which kill a diet. I found the book highly readable and made much sense."
1,Not a good diet at all,"I would never consider this diet in the first place because I lift weights and exercise and certainly low-carb would destroy my efforts.I want to warn people who consider this diet. I know a family member and her husband who have been:1. Doing the Yo Yo on this diet, losing and gaining large amounts of weight (more than 50 pounds).2. Having carb binges that you would not believe. (Not pretty watching someone scarf down ten bread sticks liek an animal at Olive Garden because they have been deprived of carbs).3. Looking worse and worse as time goes on. Muscle tone going right down the drian and having that ""skinny-fat"" look.All the lazy people who swear by it IMO are full of it. No one wants to hear that a well balanced diet with plenty of exercise and eating the rights foods is required. So if you want to dehydrate yourself and lose water weight and muscle have at it but I would strongly suggest a more healthy and logical alternative."
2,Unhealthy Diet - I Met Dr Atkins Personally,"In 1998, my company at the time asked me to meet Dr Atkins with a view toward a business deal we were contemplating with him. He was so unhealthy in appearance (palid, exhausted) that I told my boss ""Don't do a deal with this guy, I think he's going to die soon."" Since then, I've done more research into the science behind low-carb/high-protein. The fact is most Americans already get enough protein in their diets. They also get too many carbs, but that's from overeating and over-indulgence in highly processed foods... not because carbs are inherently bad. Moderation on all fronts is the only diet that works. Eating mostly meat is going to work as well as the Banana Diet did, you'll lose weight at first but then get sick and ultimately gain it back."
1,Guess who was clinically obese?,"That's right, you heard me, Dr. Atkins upon his death was clinically declared obese. Is this really the guy you want to be taking advice from? Well not me! I currently just watch what I eat and how much of it. I'm currently a 17 yr. old weighing in at 129 pounds. How did I get to be this weight? Cardiovascular exercise and calory reduction. That's all it took! And no I'm not short, I'm currently 5""9 and very happy with the state of my body. I workout at home three times a day including a once a day trip to the YMCA. Trust me if you really want results you have to always be pushing yourself, not relying on an obese man's advice. There's a reason he was obese and had physical problems! I hope you come to realize this, while working hard and staying away from this book."
1,What A Joke,"When will you people get it???? There are only two ways to be as thin as you want. One is to be born naturally thin and beautiful like me, and the other is to have rich parents who will buy you lipo if you ever need it."
3,I bought this as a filler,"I bought this as a filler item to get free shipping. Sold it on ebay and got more for it than I paid, Nice!"
1,I almost passed out,"I thought the concept was good, but this diet is in no means for anyone trying to lose a couple of pounds. When I went on this diet I wanted to lose 30 lbs. I was not overweight, and while on the diet I almost passed out and I was unable to concentrate. The diet did more harm to me then it did good. This maybe a good diet for the truly obese people but not for anyone wanting to loss a couple of lbs."
1,Bad Bad Experience,"This book was a terrible waste of money and I am glad that I stopped doing it before I got sick. I don't know what the hype is about. You lose weight for a couple of days, tell everybody, then you feel sick all of the time. By then, everyone else has told everyone and on it goes. I bought into it and am I sorry."
3,Full of himself!,"I read this book with great interest in loosing weight, and life style change. What I came away with is some information, and the opinion that Dr. Atkins is truly in love with himself. He can do no wrong. It seems that all he is interested in is selling his products. To of course get you to lose weight. However this can be done without his products. He may have helped alot of people, but I for one see through him. I do believe there is alot to the low carb. weight loss. I just do not need Atkins way. He is way too arrogant for my taste! The foods that he suggest you eat are not part of most peoples budget. If you take the information for what it is, it can be very helpful. It's just not gospel!"
4,"Diet worked great the first week, then slowed the next week","I didn't get the blood work done, but I feel better since starting the diet. The first week I was on the diet, I went from 243 to 225, WOW! Couldn't believe that I lost 18 pounds in one week. The second week I only lost 2 pounds down to 223. This week I'm only at 222, but I did start working out with weights and 3 times a week cardio, so I could be putting on muscle while I lose fat. I still feel good about losing 20 pounds in only 3 weeks. I have slept better since starting, and find I have more energy, so I started working out to use the extra energy. Biggest advantage has been the loss in inches, my face looks thinner, and I lost 3 inches around my waist. My wife and 3 co-workers are on this diet as well, so it is nice to have others to share you eating style and to have for encourgement. I recommend the book and hope others get similar results to what I have."
3,"It Does Work, ...","I went on the Atkins' Diet after reading the book. I found the book to be very articulate and informative. I found the diet easy to stick to and satisfying, although I did miss carbohydrates. I stayed on the diet for 4 days and lost 8 pounds. I suffered though with the worst migrane headache of my life."
2,"I have done this diet, and there is a better choice now","I have done this diet a few times beside being a VERY EXPENSIVE diet, to buy food for, it does not work for more than a few weeks, look around you many lose weight but they cannot keep it off it kreeps back on...here is a much better and cheaper eating diet..if you are ready to commit 6 weeks to a total makeover try Dr. Fuhrmans book, ""Eat for health"" I have lost 40 pounds in just over 2 months on this diet, yes i have alot of weight to lose but this is a much safer diet based on eating unlimited whole fruits, beans, lentils, and veggies cooked or raw and some whole wheat pasta but breads are limited ...energy level is great...I cannot thank Joel Fuhrman for a more healthy diet..."
2,Tried it... won't do it again...,"While I lost 12 pounds in 2 weeks on this diet several years ago, I won't do it again. I've found that restricting my carbohydrates to this extent causes constipation, and I had two days worth of painful intestinal gas after eating too much turkey (made a turkey dinner with all the trimmings for the family, and all I ate was the turkey and the green beans). If you've ever had problems with constipation or hemorrhoids, don't attempt this diet. There isn't enough fiber to keep you regular. Like I said, I lost weight, but it wasn't worth the health problems that arose from my particular situation."
1,Big Fat Lies,"This diet is a dangerous piece of pseudoscience. People sometimes lose weight on this diet, but not for the reasons that the author claims. First of all, a high protein diet causes dehydration. Anyone losing more than a pound or two per week is almost certainly losing water weight. Peeing more won't make you thin, period.Second, although the author describes the diet as ""luxurious"" it is actually very restrictive. The only reason anyone loses weight is because she expends more calories than she takes in. There is nothing special about the diet itself, except that it tends to be rather unappetizing to most people. Consequently, they may eat fewer calories and thereby lose weight.A stated aim of the Atkins Diet is to induce ketosis, a metabolically toxic state. Weight-loss can cause ketosis, not the other way around! Artifically inducing ketosis by diet is not only ineffective, but dangerous."
2,Boring.,"I commend the efforts of Dr. Atkins and the people who follow his plan and have amazing success. I didn't like it. I am too embedded in the low fat, versatile menu, and exercise method of weight control to be able to recommend it. It reeks of ""fad."" 2 stars are generous. I'm trying not to detract from others' success."
3,"The book reads like a infomercial, but the diet is great!","My husband and I started this diet about 10 days ago. I couldn't keep it up. I don't like meat that much. My husband is still on it and has lost 9lbs. He feels great, and is taking vitamins. I worry about the cholesterol! He doesn't have alot to lose only about 20 more lbs. This was a great way to start. I was VERY SKEPTICAL!! I read these reviews before we started the diet. He still has alot of energy and is doing great!!"
3,I'm on day 4...,"Well, I read it, I'm doing it, but I'm hungry (no extra fatigue or headaches though) and I ate a half of a bagel I wanted bread so bad! I miss fruit...I haven't gained, but after day 3 I still haven't hit ketosis...after today's bread, I think I'm back to square one...any suggestions? (I only have 10 pounds to lose so I don't expect dramatic results, but something should happen soon!"
3,"Lower weight, but watch the cholesterol!","I was on this diet before. After my mother's doctor put her on it and told her it would lower her cholesterol and help her to lose weight, I figured it was the diet for me. I did lose weight, 20 pounds in approx. 6 weeks. But my cholesterol sky rocketed to 438. That was a few years ago. I have since gained 10 pounds of my weight back. I have decided to try the diet again, this time sticking to low fat proteins. I know the diet works, and I should be able to lose 10 pounds rather quickly, but I'm certainly going to keep an eye on my cholesterol at the same time. I don't feel like this is a diet for long time dieters, mainly just a jump start to lose the weight quickly, then a different diet for maintenance. Believe it or not, you CAN get tired of meat and cheese! If you decide to use Atkin's plan for weight loss, do yourself and loved ones a favor and watch your cholesterol levels!"
2,"confusing, not clearly written for the everyday person","I myself went on this diet, wanting to lose approxiately 15-20 pounds. I found that I was very dizzy, light headed, and having trouble functioning throughout the day. I gave it my best for three weeks and finally quit. I feel this diet did more harm to me because after going off of it I gain an additional 10 pounds that I now need to deal with. Which has become very hard to take off. I find myself a healthy 45 year old women, gaining weight from the normal aging processes. I work out at least 4 times a week spinning classes, and weight lifting. I felt this was to much back ground on him and not enough of the pro and cons. Even through I do know individuals that have had good success on this diet I feel it is not for everyone."
3,Good concept but...,"the writing style is repetitive and annoying. Why not just give the facts and the diet, and leave off the justification and redundancy? I read this book after 1) working with a doctor who recommended a high protein, low carb way of eating for me... 2) reading Eades' Protein Power... 3) visiting Of the three ""guides,"" I found my doctor most obscure and idiosyncratic. Protein Power is a fact-filled ""must"" read for anyone exploring this way of eating. Atkins is too restrictive for long-term use. Goldberg-O'Mara Diet Plan in a simple and easy-to-follow manner. I suggest people with insulin resistance use Atkins for the first week only, to get themselves off carbs, read Eades for background info, and follow G/O for the rest of their lives. It's working for me - at last, I can lose and maintain at will, at a sensible pace, after years of yo-yoing."
5,Great way to lose weight!,"I am 35 years old, 5ft 41/2"" and was at least 25lbs overweight. I knew I had gained weight, and I hid it very carefully! I tried every quick fix you could think of, after all, I felt I had only a few pounds to lose! Nothing worked. Then I read Dr. Atkin's book and my eating habits have changed drastically! Counting calories is for the birds - watching your carbs and sugar is the only way to go! My whole family is on this food regimine and we've all lost weight - even my ""food picky"" 12 yr. old! I told him he could eat cheese and he went bananas! He is enjoying sugar free food (especially Jell-o) and loves meat and eggs! I recommend this program to everyone I see because THEY CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN ME! 23 lbs lighter, much more energetic and feeling great!! Read It!!!"
5,The food pyramid and AMA guidelines: WRONG!!!,"Finally the medical world is beginning to accept, worldwide, what Dr. Atkins has been saying for decades: the food pyramid is wrong! We are raised believing meat and eggs are our enemies, cereals and grains are our friends. Pig farmers in this country will tell you: want to fatten a pig? give it grain!!! not fat, or meat, but CARBOHYDRATES! our bodies work just the same. There is a great article in the NYT's magazine (July 7, 2002) that pretty much summarizes the way we have been brought up, mistakenly believing we should stuff ourselves with complex carbs to live a healthy life. I tried every diet on the planet, and the truth is I only started this one after doing some research. Want to look good, feel better and live long? the tools are here! Don't take it from me, try it."
1,Dr. Atkins Go Away,"Does the man ever shut up? I am so disappointed that people fall for his gimmicks. The diet that he recommends does have weight loss inititally and lipid levels in the body improve... this would happen with any diet. The goal is for the body to go into ketoacidosis. And this is healthy???? This can cause death!!! I do not understand how something so unhealthy has become popular. I guess people think that his quick fix is the solution because an unhealthy weight loss occurs so rapidly.Does anyone recall that the man had a heart attack recently?? I would like for him to address these questions and consult with a dietitian or nutritionist before he blathers on about this ""healthy"" plan."
1,DANGER!,"If you follow the advice of this foolish, money hungry man, you WILL regret it.Atkins recently had a heart attack and it's no wonder: you cannot eat the way he recommends and actually be healthy. This is fact. Don't take my word for it. Do a search on the internet and see what the american heart association, the american cancer society, the physicians committee for responsible medicine, and many others have to say about this book and other fad diets like it. Here's a hint: they don't like Atkins or the diet he, and others, advocates.PLEASE, if you value your health and your life, stay far away from this book. Don't be another victim of this raving fool.If you want to lose weight, try a low fat diet based on the New Four Food Groups: whole grains, legumes, vegetables & fruit."
1,People need to wake up,"First off I AM A NUTRITIONIST! Dr. ADkins is a cardiologist not a nutritionist. Would you have a plumber do your electrical work? FACT: The body does not burn fat without carbohydrate. FACT: High amounts of protein causes the body to catobolize muscle tissue which causes you to lose weight but slows your metabolism so a rebound is inevitable. Adkins claims that since carbs cause the release of insulin eliminate carbs and you will not store fat. True but protein still releases insulin. The ONLY way to lose weight is to burn more calories than you consume. FACT: CARBS= 4 cals per gram, PROTEIN 4 cals per gram, Alcohol 7 cals per gram, and FAT 9 cals per gram. SO carbs has the same caloric makeup as protein. Come on people think over the facts yourselves and don't fatten the pockets of this man who doesn't know what he is talking about."
1,nothing more than a fad,"i tried this diet a few years ago and not only did it make me considerably fatter, but i felt very unhealthy. it made me feel as though all the aerobic exercise i was getting wasn't working anymore. i got winded walking up stairs and was constantly tired, vapid, and sluggish. i figured a diet which praises high protien intake can only be good for my weight training regimen, but i only felt weaker on this diet. and i made sure i followed it perfectly. something doesn't seem right about fad diets that de-emphasize healthy exercise and tell you to completely exclude certain foods or whole food groups."
4,A Healthy New Beginning,I recently bought this book from Amazon.com and I can't put it down. The things that Dr. Atkins say make absolute perfect sense. The diet is based on eating things that will not trigger fat storage and this helps you to burn stored fat. It does not focus soley on red meat - it focuses on protein rich natural foods. It is definitely worth checking out if you are having trouble losing weight - i have already lost 15 pounds.
1,missing info,"If you can keep up with the induction foods list for instance, you'll probably have to write it down anyway. It didn't cover any where near the amount of info that the book covers."
2,Tuna eaters beware,"I did The Atkin's Diet two years ago. I lost 20 pounds in a month. But after a year things started to go terribly wrong. I begain having horrible syptoms of food allergy. But testing showed I had none. I went to doctor after doctor and they all told me I was crazy. I finally had no choice ,but to do research on my own. I discovered a web site about Mercury Poisoning. I had all the classic syptoms and none of the docotrs I saw had any clue. I found a company that did testing by hair samples. I ordered the test and bingo, I'm posative for higher levels of Mercury. And it was from eating so much canned tuna while on the Atkins Diet. I'm not blaming the diet plan itself, but he does recommend eating tuna. I wouldn't go there if I were you."
1,not reccomended,"too many concerns about people developing liver problems on this diet.thou the diet works, you have to stay on it, forever, or gain the weight back, and at what long term cost to your health?"
1,A JOKE,"All of you...come on! You may lose weight but have any of you checked your blood pressure or cholesteral lately? To the woman who said she eats nothing but poultry, beef, eggs, cheese & bacon; it's a great diet for people who don't like vegetables; people can't believe I've lost weight eating this stuff.... All I can say is it's really not going to matter that you've lost weight on this so-called diet when you're dead from a heart attack!"
1,FAILED ON ATKINS,"This is the naive kind of diet you would expect a western doctor to come up with! They are not rained in health, but in cutting up people and drugging them.This is one of many books I've read on my quest for health. On this diet I was UNBELIEVABLY CONSTIPATED. I later discovered from my chiropractor that my liver and gall bladder, like most American's, was already stressed and overloaded and this was an extremely unwise diet. I ALSO DIDN'T LOSE ANY WEIGHT.For more sound advice, try Dr. Abravanel's Body Type Diet. You'll understand why some people can do okay on a high protein diet. But, even better, you'll understand your own body and you'll have a do-able path to health and thiness! Dr. Abravanel's book is the VERY BEST health book I've ever read. Now I have energy ALL DAY, no more mood swings, NO MORE FOOD CRAVINGS, and my cellulite is going away."
3,Not A Meat Lover,"The concepts introduced in Dr. Atkins book are very interesting and easily explained. However, I just found the diet too restrictive--no dairy, fresh fruits and veggies! I just couldn't face more meat and cheese. How can that be a healthy life long eating plan?"
3,Proceed with caution,"I do believe this diet can work, but it's not for everyone - and not for me nor my husband. We followed it religiously for 2 weeks. The first week we both lost 1 lb per day - great. The 2nd week my husband started gaining weight - we still don't know why. I felt nauseous and ill the entire time I was on the diet, despite nutritional supplements, etc. The upshot is, this diet enabled us to cut out sugar and severely restrict carbs from our diet. However, we now eat vegetables (except corn, carrots, and potatoes) and 1 pc. fruit per day and feel much healthier. This diet was just too extreme for us. We now follow a diet similar to the Sugar Busters diet and feel much better than we did on Atkin's diet."
3,I am still debating!!,"Well - i started out strong but by the third day the thought of anymore cheese, eggs,and meat made me sick. i was so sluggish i couldn't get off the couch!!! i ended up missing half of the day outdoors with my family. while i understand the whole philosophy dr. atkin's presents, i just can't get comfortable with no fruits, limited vegetables and sugar substitutes like aspartame and nutrasweet. it is true that i did not experience any hunger and my appetite was absolutely suppressed. however this was to the point where no food seemed appealing - i couldn't even get myself to drink. at times i feel desperate enough to lose weight to try anything - after 2 kids in 18 months Lord knows i need it - but making myself feel sick is not the way. i am happy to see this diet has worked for so many people. when i find something else i'll write a book about it and make a million!!!"
5,very good book,I got the book today and it is very good i have to go this diet as i have polycystic ovarian sydrome and i think it is great to have i am looking in to buying the cook as well.i very helpful book
2,It did not work for us !,"I have tried this diet and I was very excited about it at the begining, but after a week I did not experience any weight loss. I have been very strict and did not cheat even ones. Never the less myself and my wife did not loose any weight. One good thing came out of it is that I am sick of meats and fats that have always been a major risk factor for our health. Now I will diet on only carbs for a few weeks till I get sick of them too. Then with vegitables and fresh fruits left in my daily diet I think I will be a much healthier person. Good luck to all of you people like myself that have been trying to loose weight for all of these years. I gave it 2 stars because it gives you more insight about diets and how your body reacts to them."
1,Atkins Diet is unhealthy and expensive!!,"I bought this book last yaer and was so excited that I could eat all the fattening foods I had stayed away from. But the diet was hard to stick to: who wants to eat meat and cheese all the time? Granted, I did lose weight, but I gained I as soon as I stopped. Also, the ""free"" food all require preparation and are expensive to buy. I now spend less than $40 a week on groceries, but the Atkins diet had me spending upwards of $70 because meat, cheese and other fatty foods are costly. Besides, can a diet really be good for you if your breath stinks from ketosis, you have constipation and can't eat food grown from the earth? If you need to lose a quick 10 or 20 lbs for an event Atkins is okay, but other than that, this diet is worthless."
1,Seems pretty close to Sugar Busters to me,I feel as if this effort by Dr. Atkins is a clone of Sugar Busters only with different recipes.Nice try though.
2,Why am I not losing weight?,"I have been following the diet religiously for nine full days, and I have not lost a SINGLE POUND. Dr. Atkins is virtually silent on this subject: the only paragraph I could find in his book was ""There still are those who do get a measurable ketogenic/lipoltic response and still do not lose weight....usually turn up an explanation based on medication or a hormonal problem."" page 230. Huh? Has anyone else had the same problem? Oh, and by the way, have you checked out the prices for products on the Atkins website? OUCH! $2.69 for a carbo-bar! Plus S&H! Here's a tip from me: Walgreen's sells ketone strips (not ""lipolysis strips"") for $9.99, as opposed to $12.99 plus S&H from Atkins. Please email me if you have had the same problem -NOT LOSING WEIGHT!"
5,"Great diet, Great results!!","I lost ten lbs in two weeks without feeling deprived. I am A positive & had great success so I think that blood type has little if any thing to do with it. I've stuck with low carb since last Summer and I am still thrilled. I don't get the afternoon energy dives & my skin & hair look better than they have in years. I know alot of people who are trying Atkins & NONE of them have had health problems as a result. Just the opposite: heartburn disappears, more energy, ect. Infact, alot of doctors are realizing it's the best & most natural way to eat, instead of processed flour & sugar which are the real culprits in heart disease, cancer, and obesity. Try it for yourself & see! It's fun to see your fat disappear & your muscles toning up with less effort. I can't recommend this book enough. ."
4,Finally a diet that works!,"I wish I could find the exact book that was featured on the TV show,The View.That one was new and revised. Anyway,this diet is amazing and if you read the book carefully,stay away from too many veggies,use the ketone sticks and exercise it will work. You will lose the urge to eat alot too. Even though my metabolism was all but shot,I'm still losing weight,but I can't do too many carbs yet."
3,Too much hype but informative.,"Not everyone loses ten pounds the first week! Dr. Atkins should be a little more honest about the average dieter's experience--maybe one or two pounds a week. For me, a diabetic on insulin, the best part of the diet (beside losing sixteen pounds in fourteen weeks) was being able to reduce my injections to less than a quarter of the insulin I used before. Even my psoriasis looks better!"
2,The book gave me hope the diet gave me hunger pains,"I read this book in its entirety in a couple of hours...it gave me hope and courage...The testimonials were just what I needed to believe..then I started the diet...I don't think that anyone realizes that carbohydrates are in everything that we eat except for meat and chicken. I got terrible headaches, stomach pains and couldn't think because I was so hungry...if you can do this diet God Bless you...do yourself a favor though...make sure your doctor knows that you are on it so that he knows how to help you when you get rushed to the hospital"
5,I HAVE LOST WEIGHT AND FEEL GREAT.,I HAVE BEEN ON THE DIET FOR FOURTEEN DAYS AND HAVE LOST TEN POUNDS AND HAVE NOT HAD ONE ATTACK OF ACID-REFLEX OR INDIGESTION. I HAD AN AWFUL PROBLEM WITH ACID-REFLEX FOR MONTHS AND WAS ON ALL KINDS OF PILLS AND AFTER STARTING THIS DIET I HAVE NOT HAD ONE ATTACK. THE BOOK WAS GREAT AND I AM SO GLAD I READ IT. THANKS DR. ATKINS.
4,"I won't say it is for everyone, but it worked for me.","My ENT physician suggested this diet rather than an operation to correct a sleep disorder. The fat on the outside of my body was also within. By losing weight my snoring and chocking would stop. He was correct. After losing the first 15 pounds, I slept without a sound (Could have been my wife chocking me because of the noise).Cravings did cease and I eat much less because I am not hungry. Over the past year I have lost 60 pounds. Feel younger at 48 than I did at 38. Because I eat much less, I actually consume less fat than when I ate ""normal."" Vitamins and exercise have become a way of life.I no longer consider this a diet, it has become my normal way of eating. After a year of losing all of the weight needed, I now can have the complex carbohydrates, just in smaller portions. However, I stay away from refined sugar, the hidden plague."
3,Everyone is a diet expert yet we're all fat,"I love Amazon. More than 1,000 opinions on this book. The most amusing reviews are those from non-medical professionals who either haven't even read the book nor tried the diet. Yet they have dozens of reasons why it's bad, bad, bad. I have read the book. I'm considering the diet. His theory makes sense. And I have my reservations.My most significant reservation is the lack of variety. Even on maintenance one only is allowed 60 grams of carbohydrate per day. One Lean Cuisine and you're done for the day.Frankly, I think it's too coincidental that obesity rates in this country began to increase right about when the government began promoting its carb-heavy food pyramid. And did anyone see the cover of the New York Times Sunday Magazine recently? The cracks in the carb-heavy food pyramid are beginning to widen. If it turns out that Dr. Atkins is right, a lot of people will be eating a different kind of high-protein meal . . . crow."
4,"Tried JC, WW,HL,NL, and numerous other diets-THIS ONE WORKS","Easy to read, easy to follow program. In 7 days, I have lost 8lbs., my husband has lost 10. We are both certain that we arecarbo-addicts! I personally have tried many of the recent diet program regimens including the recent Xenical drug, but found I was unsatisfied, hungry, and very aware I was ""dieting"". On this program, so far, I feel none of that. After the 3rd day on program, my appetite is greatly diminished and I do not feel deprived or hungry. If you want to find out if you too are addicted to carbohydrates - try this one for even a week, you'll be amazed!"
4,Has me on the way to thin!!,"The only reason for not giving a 5 star rating, I felt the book lacked editorial quality, many contradictions and I would find some sentences requiring me to stop, slow down and reread them, still never made sense, HOWEVER! I have been on the diet for 3 weeks and have lost 12 pounds. I have not felt this much energy in years. I will say I did not stop my morning coffee (one cup) and still managed to lose! One note: Dr Atkins kinda looks like he should practice what he preaches!Good Luck if you decide to try this!!"
2,Extreme low carb not for everyone,"I did Adkins for 6 weeks and felt horrible the whole time. Yes, I lost weight - about 16 lbs. but 6 of those pounds were muscle loss and a few more pounds were water. I also felt very dehydrated even though I drank more than the recommended amount. I've tried other low-carb diets and Sugarbusters was the one I like the best, it allows for more carbs and was able to stay in ketosis. Adkins is ultra low carb - and that works for some people but it is not for everyone, and definately not for me. Just my 2 cents!"
5,THIS DIET WORKS,"BELIEVE ME THIS DIET WORKS! THE MAIN REASON I STARTED THIS DIET WAS OBVIOUSLY TO LOSE WEIGHT, BUT ALSO TO GET MY MOTHER TO TRY IT FOR HER DIABETES. (SHE'S A TWO SHOT A DAY INSULIN DEPENDANT DIABETIC). HER SUGAR LEVEL IS IN THE NORMAL RANGE NOW (IT USED TO BE OVER 200). CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE REDUCING YOUR INSULIN THOUGH. ALSO HER CARDIOLOGIST RECOMMENDED THAT SHE STAY ON THIS DIET BECAUSE HE HAS ALOT OF PATIENTS WHO HAVE HAD TREMENDOUS RESULTS ON IT. (SHE WAS NOT SURE THE DOCTOR WOULD APPROVE OF IT) BUT THE PROOF FOR HER IS THAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT WAY TO CONTROL SYMPTOMS OF CARDIAC PROBLEMS NOT TO MENTION DIABETES AND WEIGHT CONTROL. SO FAR I'VE LOST 20LBS IN A MONTH AND THEY ARE STILL COMING OFF. FOR THE NAYSAYERS, SAY WHAT YOU WILL BUT THOSE OF US WHO HAVE ACTUALLY TRIED THIS DIET ARE CONVINCED THAT IT WORKS."
4,Great Information,"I am not doing the Atkins diet but I have successfully applied some of the knowledge I gained from this book to lose about 20 pounds in two months. Basically, I cut down on carb and increased oil and meat intake. The weight loss is real but very counter-intuitive. However, you cannot argue with results. Also, as a result of reading part of this book I started taking fish oil supplement. It appears to have a positive impact on my blood pressure. I highly recommend this book to anyone, not only people with weight problems. This is a gold mine of information on nutrition."
2,Great for my weight...Poison to my brain,"The Atkins plan sure does achieve weight loss (hence the two stars instead of one), but at what cost. I lost 12 pounds in the six weeks I followed the diet, but my mood spriraled down further and further in each passing week. I know this isn't true for everyone, but I finally had to throw in the towel, and I've talked to others who have had similar experiences on Atkins. For anyone else who has experienced depression, anxiety or cloudiness on this diet, then I suggest following the food plan in either Kay Shepard's book, Food Addiction: The Body Knows, or Dr. Matthew Keene's Chocolate is My Kryptonite: Feeding Your Feelings/How to Survive the Forces of Food. Both stress foods that boost seratonin/mood as a means to controlling cravings and losing weight...in other words, you can happy, and still lose weight!"
3,A different approach,"I was curious about this book to improve longevity. I got much of my previous information in another book, The Secrets of Staying Young which talked about some herbs from Russia that keep them healthy to 120. I am interested to get other long term opinions on this diet. It seems to be OK for short term result. The herbs and information on minerals and EFAs in the other book, seem to be good for long term. Dr. Atkins book is thought provoking."
4,"A diet that really works, if you put your mind to it.","I started this diet 5 days ago and boy, were the first three days hard. I never realized how addicted I was to sugar. But I stuck to it and I have lost 7 pounds, and I feel great. I am well on my way to reach my goal of 35 pounds. The book really gives you incentive to stick to the diet. You do have to be willing to cook and have many ideas for cooking eggs different ways, or you can easily get sick of them. I am a very picky eater, but I am finding a variety of foods to eat low in carbohydrates. If you want to lose weight, don't hesitate."
5,I lost 10 lbs in a week!,"I can't comment on the scientific explanation as to why, I just took his word for it. His explanations made sense to me and I tried it. I am going into the second week and have already lost 10 lbs! ... and I cheated a few times too! (soda is my downfall). I did experience an, unusual for me, very bad headache a couple days into the diet that lasted a full day. By the fourth day my energy was markedly increased and I could already start to see a physical difference in my body as I was only 10 lbs overweight to begin with. I do still crave breads, pasta and potatoes, etc, but will probably eat them in moderation after I go down a few more pounds and can afford to gain a few pounds. I just can't believe how quick the weight came off eating SO MUCH (more than I normally eat) food, and how good I feel. I highly recommend this book as a fast way to lose weight. Be sure to take a multi-vitamin while on this diet though."
3,"The book is OK, but the diet it promotes is extreme.","Dr. Atkins book is scientifically sound according to my physician who approved my starting the Atkins diet. But, the diet is very difficult to follow and dining out is virtually impossible if you want edible food. I did learn that mediocre food is disguised with sauces, catsup, gravy and the like. And the claim that you can eat all you want of carbohydrate-free foods is nonsense. I have bought the finest steaks, fish, and fowl that can be had, but still crave the taste of bread, potatoes, vegetables, fruit and dessert. The fact is you cannot lose weight without giving up something. The Atkins diet requires you to give up a lot. It ain't pretty, but the diet will carve off pounds. Thomas E. Bates"
2,A Radical Approach Not For Everybody,"I have followed the low-carb diet for the past week and have decided to go on to something more balanced. I think Dr Atkins makes a good point about over-indulgenece in carbohydrates, but a radical approach like his is probably best for ppl who are middle aged and/or truly obese. For guys like me who are in their early 20s and already have a 31"" waist but want to get ""ripped"",(ie lose 20 lbs or less) I would suggest reducing the overall amount of carbs (which should come from fruits, vegetables and whole grain breads), drinking a lot of water, and regular aerobic exercise. The carbs you really want to minimize are the ones in cereals, pasta and of course sugary foods. I also found with the Atkins-type diet that I had almost no energy to exercise, which can't be a good thing. In summary, I think the body requires a more balanced diet for healthy fat loss. Good Luck!!"
3,"good at first, but tired of protein","I have been on the Atkins diet for approximately 20 days and have lost approximately 12 pounds. At first I enjoyed eating all the meat and protein, but now I am craving fruits and vegtables. Anyone have any ideas on what to do. I did have one day where I ate pizza and I think it triggered the cravings. I know that if this is going to be a lifetime adventure, I will need to have a balance. Need to have suggestions on a ""treat"" that is low in carbohydrate."
5,This diet rocks!,I have been on the diet for 13 days now and have lost 11 lbs already! I have more energy and am never hungry. Dr. Atkins explanation of why the diet works makes perfect sense. I have tried other diets and was on Weight Watchers for a couple months. I did lose weight but have always gained it back. The problem with other diets is that they are okay for a short period of time but not realistic for the rest of your life. With Atkins you slowly add carbs back into your diet and the book shows you how. I know this diet is going to work for me!
2,IF IT SOUNDS TO GOOD TO BE TRUE IT PROBABLY IS,"I wanted to lose 45 pounds and I decided to try Atkins diet,it did not work well for me at all. By the end of the first day I had a killer headache that would not even go away with prescription Motrin,I was very weak and I had a greasy taste in my mouth the entire day by the second day I was so sick I had to leave work I still had the greasy taste in my mouth and I felt so nauseated. My friend has been doing this diet for a little over a month and she loves it I guess it just is not right for everyone. Last year in April I went on a low fat diet and took a water aerobics class and within 3 weeks I dropped 26 pounds and I felt wonderful I will stick with the old fashion way of doing things eating balanced meals and exercising."
5,It's working for me,"All I can say is that it's working for me. I've been on it for 2 months and lost 20lbs. I believe I can eat this way forever. My cravings are gone, my heartburn is gone, my feet don't hurt anymore, no more headaches. Losing weight is an added bonus! Once the cravings for carbs and caffeine were gone (in the first 3 days) I felt better and more energetic than I have in years. My doctor said, ""If it works for you, stay with it"" I plan to. Thank you Dr. Atkins!"
1,here we go again,"When are the overweight folks out there going to realize that ""tricking"" your body into losing weight is unhealthy if not downright dangerous. I get a kick out of all those reviewers who gave five stars just because they managed to drop some poundage in a few days. Sure, you could do the same by having your left arm taken off too. Instead of looking for that quick fix and seeing the old numbers drop on the scale, why not just commit yourself to limiting calories, eating a balanced diet and getting off the old duff?"
2,Too strict for a long term program,I found myself sick to death of protein (something I never would have figured could have happened) It seemed the diet became blander and blander as time progressed.
1,Atkins,"This turned out to be a paperback version of the original 1992 edition, nothing 'revised' about it. It's in the pile for the yard sale. I'd borrowed a much more recent version, the one pictured, from the library and wanted my own copy. Worth a penny, yes. Too bad about the $3.99 shipping."
1,Don't buy it!,"I tryed the program and lost 10 pounds in one month, then stopped losing weight and fell off the diet in 2 months. It is too hard to stay on the diet because of the limited food choice. Don't do it!"
1,Dangerous,"A decade ago, I tried Dr. Atkins' diet and followed it religously for six months. I sucessfully maintained a state of ketosis about 90% of the time. Sure, I lost an incredible amount of weight, but I was sick most of the time while I was on it... headaches, shakiness, sweats... and as soon as I discontinued the diet, the weight came back with a vengeance. It may work for some people, but it is CRITICALLY IMPORTANT that you consult a doctor or nutritionist before you try it. Ketosis is a very dangerous metabolic state and the weight loss results are temporary."
5,It's the healthiest eating plan around,"When I was diagnosed with diabetes 8 years ago, my Dr. put me on a low-calorie diet. It didn't work because I was always hungry. I changed doctors. My new doctor recommended the Atkins book. So I read the book, started the diet, and when I had my next appointment with the doctor a couple of months later my weight was down substantially, my cholesterol had dropped, my blood pressure was normal, and my blood glucose was normal for the first time in years! It's a miracle diet, especially for diabetics, but also for anyone who needs to lose weight and eat healthy.Don't be taken in by those who lambast the diet as unhealthy. Most of them haven't even read this book. Thankfully, though, new research is proving Dr. Atkins was right all along. Not only is this diet easier to follow than the low-fat diet, it really is the more natural way for humans to eat, considering the lifestyle of our cave-man ancestors."
2,Sent the wrong book,I ordered the Dr. Atkin's NEW diet Rev. book and got a 1972 copy of the original book he wrote instead. So I'm not able to rate this book very well.
3,Sorry to say that this diet did not work for me.,"I tried this diet to the letter, and was going strong with it. Then after about 4 days into it my stomach started hurting. I tried everything to endure it. I researched on the net about what could be causing my discomfort, because it was painful enough I couldn't function. I finally broke down, and slowly ate more carbs than directed, and little by little the pain went away. It actually took a couple days for my stomach to go back to normal. I may just have a sensitive stomach, or maybe my stomach acids are a little stronger than most. But I did loose 3 lbs in those 4 days! So I'm giving it 3 stars, cause it may work for someone else. Just wasn't a good fit for me."
4,Exactly what I was looking for,"The book was exactly what I was looking for. Very informative. It did do a lot of reiterating, which I found to be quite irritating. The only reason I took 1 star off."
3,Where were the publisher's proof-readers?,"Atkin's diet is good and obviously valuable to a great many people; however, it became difficult for me to take his work seriously after plowing through page after page of typographical errors and misspelled words. Lacksadaisical printing led me to wonder whether greed propelled this poorly produced work before the public or an altruistic desire to help as many overweight people as possible. Dr. Atkins, you should be embarrassed that your name is on the cover; I suggest you find another publisher if you want to be taken seriously."
1,Unhealthy and a poor read,"First of all, I tried this diet after I heard all the hype, and not only did it not work, but it made me really sick. I've talked to several nutritionists since then who all agreed the diet is extremely unhealthy.Also the book is all fluff. It is a very simple plan that could be througly described in 2 pages max. If you really want to try this diet out, please don't waste your money on the book that just goes on forever and ever, just go to his web site or skim the book in a book store."
2,Don't think this is very healthy.....,"I have read the book, after a co-worker told me about the diet. I have not been overweight all of my life. I have always used The Scarsdale Diet. Since I've had my son I don't have the time to workout like i used to, so I have gained weight. I WILL definetly stick to Dr. Tarnowers Scarsdale diet. It is very healthy and you get the same results. Quick weight loss and feel great. So for anyone looking for a healthier diet than this I urge you to try that one. Lots of Fruit and Veges. No Starch or JUNK FOOD."
4,good book,"I think this is a good book for fat people. You should do this diet, it works. I lost 7lbs. I recommend it for anyone."
3,Still a yo-yo,"After many failed attempts to lose weight after two back injuries, I decided to give this a try. It worked for the first two weeks, I lost 13lbs. all without exercising, but the problem came in the third week. As I started to add carbs back into my food consumption, even a small amount, I gained the weight back. I started to exercise the best I could given my present condition, but the weight has stayed. I believe this eating plan works (diet is a dirty word)when followed closely with minimum carb intake. I'm going to give it another try, as I have seen excellent results from others who have tried it and succeeded. Best of luck."
2,good promises but not for everyone...,"I went into this diet with some great expectations...""wow, eat as much as you want and lose weight?"" Of course, these expectations are false. i just wanted to lose a few pounds, and it seems that the diet only works if you're hyper obese. I lost 5 pounds, but it wasn't worth the struggle...it's nearly impossible not to eat carbohydrates. The book makes it sound like you can eat whatever you want and there's a great variety, but you can really only eat meat, some vegetables, and jello. I wouldn't call this a great ""variety"". I wish I could find a more realistic diet plan. Also, you feel very exhausted while on the diet because you're not getting enough nutrients. Supplements just don't do it. I would suggest this diet only for people who really need to take weight off for health reasons...other than that, it's just a whole lot of trouble for something that's not really worth it."
4,"Poorly written, but it does work!","Dr. Atkins really needs a ghost writer; he does not write well. But, the plan really does work. However there are many things he neglects to say. For example, it is common to stall for a while after induction while your body adjusts. Also, many foods have hidden carbs. The diet works, but find low carb support groups on the Internet to help you fine tune it."
5,It made a difference,"I was depressed about my weight. I went to the doctor, who sent me to a nutritionist. I followed the nutritionst's recommendations to the letter...kept my calories under 1,000 per day, kept a journal of everything I ate, and joined a fitness center. I worked out at least 4 times a week, for up to 80 minutes, and two months in a row was in the top 3 at the fitness center for total exercise effort. In three months, I lost 2 pounds. Talk about frustration!Then I found Atkins. In 2 months, I lost 20 pounds, I was never hungry, my mood and energy improved, I quit counting calories and cut back on exercise. And the weight continued to come off the entire time I followed the diet...total of 35 lbs, which was my goal.Exercise and low fat diet didn't work.Atkins did."
5,The only way to lose weight and change the carb addiction,"I had never been on a diet until August of 2001. I lost 8lb in the induction diet; I went from 5'5"", 133 lb to 125lb. Of course this is a radical approach but once your body gets rid of the stored sugar (48hrs), you can feel the ketosis.TIPSBUY THE KETOSTRIPSIt will show you the results as they happenDRINK LOTS OF WATER/TEAIt will help your system flushKEEP LOW CARB BARS IN YOUR BAG AND A PROTEIN SHAKE HANDYSometimes, if you are hungry but don't want the egg or cheese snack, hang on to one of these. They also help you with sugar cravings. Have them if you feel like eating a cookie.After two weeks you can see! It will help you eat well and cook great tasty meals. It's not 'just meat'. I don't eat red meat, but lots of fish and some chicken.Go For It!"
5,What about me?,I'm very interested in beginning the Atkins diet. However I only have about 35 lbs to lose. it seems that the comments are mostly from people that began quite overweight. Does it work as well for people with only minimal wieght loss required?Pleas E mail me with success stories from anyone with lesser weight loss goals. and if possible include success stories (or unsuccessful) and time frames if their is a dramatic difference. Thanks Threelangs@aol.com
5,I didnt believe it at first but 2 week proved it to me!!,"I am not overweight just unhappy about my weight, 21/2 weeks ago I weighed 141 i am 5'5 and not use to weighing that much. I just wanted to lose 15 pounds so I gave it a chance. I have not been able to lose these last 15 pounds in 2 years. Well I went down to 127 on my 14th day of this diet. It is so unbelievable yet it works. Now all my friends who laughed at me are now on it. Try It!!!"
3,Works great for some people.,"I started on this diet two years ago and within the first 2 weeks I lost 10 lbs. I thought I had finally found a soution to my weight problem. However, the problem with this diet is that if you go off of it any weight you lose seems to come back double. I feel that Dr. Atkins is on the money when he says that processed carbs are mostly responsible for our weight problems, but I also feel that putting your body into ketosis does something to alter your body's fat cells and causes them to retain more fat at an alarming rate. I wish Dr. Atkins had a website so I could speak to him about this."
5,Forget What You Hear - This Works,"I have lost over thirty pounds in three months. I go to the same restaurants I've always patronized, and I do almost everything that I've done in the past. One positive side effect the diet has had is that I've cut way down on drinking alcoholic beverages. Now the good news: the tight size 38 pants I had to wear when I bought the book are neatly boxed up and waiting to be dropped off at the GoodWill Center. Whenever I need to go anywhere now, I wear my 34's. Pretty soon though, I'll need 32's. I love the diet.I have one question. I read in another book that on a diet such as this one you do not need to count carbo's that are dietary fiber grams. Does anyone out there have any advice on this?"
5,Excellent source of medical and practical weight loss information,"I read Dr. Atkin's first book about the Atkin's style of eating and while much of the information is the same, this book does give us some updates, such as providing the difference in definitions between ketosis and ketoacidosis. While a controversial eating plan, I know this plan can work and work well for those who choose to adhere to it. As with all diet or eating plans, one should consult with a physician first and use good common sense. Whether you want to implement a carb-controlled eating plan or not, this is a good place to find out how your body utilizes various nutrient sources. Excellent read, in my opinion."
4,He did not have a heart attack,"Please do not post things that are not true. Dr. Atkins developed an infection inside his heart. He picked up the infection while on a camping trip. This diet works very well, and I've noticed that most of those who criticize it did not go on the diet themselves, but are speaking from a knee-jerk reaction (or ""hearsay""). People should not rate this diet unless they have actually been on it. Read the reviews; all these people the diet worked for (and experienced dramatic improvements in their health) cannot be wrong."
3,sick of eggs,"I bought the book after seeing a friend whom I hadn't seen in almost a year. She looked incredible! Over 4 inches of fat were gone from her arms and she was 119 pounds (down from 160 lbs). I practice martial arts up to 8 hours a week, but I could not seem to stop eating carb rich foods and the weight constantly went up. Inspired by my friend, and warned, I am now far into the 'induction' stage of the Atkins system. She warned me that it was not an easy diet and many people could not do it. Well, I am doing fine but I cannot stand the thought of another egg for breakfast! The induction stage is hard for an old pasta, pizza and veggi eater. Meat almost makes me sick to look at now. But... I really *do* feel full faster and I do not crave the foods I used to. I even went to a festival with food every where and hardly thought about it. It works, but the induction stage is hard. Book is not well organized."
1,SNAP OUT OF YOUR SELF-HATRED PEOPLE!!!,"Listen up, everyone. Here's the low down on this deceptively ""revolutionary"" book. I've read it, the Sugarbusters book, the Protein Power book, AND the horrible 5 Day Miracle Diet book - and guess what? THEY DO WORK!!! But a month later your life is so imprisoned in a cocoon of restrictive and unnatural dietary habits that quite frankly I'll take a few extra pounds over a reduced quality of life any damn day! God made all this wonderful variety of food for us to enjoy here on Earth! Why do we deprive ourselves of it? How about a book called ""The Eat EVERYTHING In Moderation Diet Revolution""? I'd buy that! And most importantly LIVE by it! Eggs and steak for life with no fruits ever? Come on!!!!!! This has GOT to be dangerous over the long term. There are other, BETTER ways to trim up and be happy!I love you all! Buh-bye! Buh-bye now."
1,This Book Almost Killed Me!,"I bought this book some time ago and after using it my cholesterol level went way up! By the time I got to a doctor I was a heart attack waiting to happen. I did drop some weight and felt good for a while, but THIS BOOK DOESN'T WORK FOR LONG-TERM WEIGHT LOSS AND HEALTH! I did finally improve my health and lose my extra blubber for good, but it was with a book by Gary Rempe."
1,Dieting for the comatose,"My weight problem has always been my love for carbohydrates, so I figured Dr. Atkins diet that eliminates this obstacle would be just the diet for me. Unfortunately, I couldn't stay on this diet for even one day, and it had nothing to do with food cravings. The severe lack of carbohydrates in my diet made me feel so drained by the afternoon, I was shaky, dizzy, and listless. I tried this diet for a full week, and every evening I had to ""cheat"" by drinking a little orange juice to bring my sugar level back up. I've never had a diet affect me this severely, and would not reccomend it for anyone."
2,Not Balanced,"In looking at this diet and those of others I choose the 40-30-30 plan over Atkins and have lost over 90 pounds on that diet. The Adkins diet plan does not ""Balance"" out your meals, but sets you up in a planned eating arena of low carbs, high fat and protein. As soon as you go off the diet plan then back comes the weight.Along with proper diet comes exercise, but that's not stressed enough in Adkins diet. The book is wordy and needs to get to the point, and it's my recommendation that if purchased be prepared for a constant ""Atkins plan"" in your life."
1,For The Weak-Minded,"This seems to be a quick solution for fast weight loss. It isn't. The reason you are losing weight is simply because you are cutting down on food intake. The real solution to good health and weight maintenance is exercise and eating healthily. For crying out loud do not cut down on vegetables and fruit. I agree processed bread and sugar are bad for you, but that is because of the chemical processes. If you want to eat all the meat and eggs you want, as according to this diet, that is fine, but haven't you ever heard of clogged arteries? Fat intake this extreme is very bad for your heart in the long run. Quit looking for a quick way out and get off your lazy behind and exercise."
1,"This is dangerous to your health, please dont try it.","This is awful and dangerous to your health. If you're that serious about losing weight, try weight watchers, that way you can still eat normal foods. This is so dangerous and detrimental to your health everyone, if you don't believe me, then research the effects on your own scientifically. I cant believe he's even allowed to sell a book that could cause someones death."
1,Lose Weight by Torturing and Killing Animals,"Hey, instead of increasing your consumption of meat, eggs and cheese, why not just go to a stockyard and start beating cattle with a stick? That'll burn off those excess calories. Perhaps a nice day de-beaking baby chicks or beating injured sows?This diet is a travesty. It may make you lose weight but it is extremely unhealthy and incredibly cruel to animals."
2,"Yeah, you'll lose weight, but you'll never learn how to eat!!!","I've lost a lot of weight on this diet, I'm half way there but I won't continue. As soon as you eat carbs, forget about it, you blow up like a ballon!! You stop drinking the water because you don't want it as you did when eating all that ""good"" fat and protein with extremely low fibirous carb intake. I DO NOT SUGGEST this diet at all, there aren't long term scientific studies that say you won't have heart problems in the long run. I don't buy what the Atkins Center says, they went bankrupt earlier this year, but they've become billionaires in the last few years---go figure?! If you truly want to look good for the long haul, try a healthy approach. That's what I've decided to do. Its not just about losing, its about keeping it OFF!! Nothing is more deterring than losing it and gaining it all back."
1,I feel sorry for all of you believing this...,So glad Dr. Atkins has caused so many people to become so utterly fixated on food. Obsession of food intake is not healthy. Losing a pound a day is not healthy. Please stop this before you get sick.
5,BE HEALTHY FEEL HEALTHY,"I have nine friends and clients on this diet now. All are showing positive results including myself (lost 28lbs in 10 weeks and I feel great!).But I agree you must read the book fully first. If you don't, like anything not done correctly, you could do yourself harm. But that doesn't make it dangerous. The bible is just as dangerous, if you only read the old testament then you'll believe in and ""eye for and eye, and a tooth for a tooth..."", but read on and you discover ""Thou shalt not kill..."". 'The New Diet Revolution' is like the bible in that it is full of hidden/important information that must be digested in its entirety. Dr Atkins book is the Bible of diets!"
4,I'm starting this because my Dad looks awesome!,"I saw my Dad, who lives in NY, 3000 miles from me, at Christmas 1997. He was FAT! I worried for weeks afterwards about his health. Well, I just saw him again for the first time since Christmas and WOW...he looks wonderful. Seeing him happy and healthy again is all I need to get me started, as well. I need to lose 50 plus. Wish me luck!"
2,INTRESTED,"I am intrested in trying this diet, however I have read a lot of conflicting information. I am 5'8"" and weigh 260lbs. I need to lose 130lbs. Are there any suggestions if this is the diet for me? I have tried countless diets, and have had a weight problem since I was 6. I was in Weight Watchers at age 13 and I am now 23. I don't want to be fat any more. Please give me some suggertions."
3,needs to be more informative about what you can eat.,"I started the atkins diet last Monday and lost 7 lbs the 1st week. Of course, I am very pleased. But I am confused about how phase II differs from phase one. The diet seems great, although I read a lot of controversy on low carb diets. I plan to stick with it for a while, just to see what happens. But I will have to read some sections again to see what I missed. My weight loss is aready noticable, and 3 people at work have run out to buy the book."
5,Incredible diet with incredible results,"I have been on the diet,(lifestyle change) for 3 weeks now. I have lost 15 pounds, and more importantly have more energy than ever before. I plan on sticking with it for the long haul. It is medically sound and easy to stay on. It's nice to fit into clothes I haven't been able to wear for years. One important note, TAKE the supplements Dr. Atkins recommends. Co-Enzyme Q, Chromium, Carnitine, and the high dosage multi-vitamins are very important. They absolutely work and are proven medically."
3,Be Careful,"Following any of the low-carb, high-protein diets will definitely cause pounds to fall off. What these books do not stress, however, is the eight glasses of water a day. Actually 10 or 15 might be better. Much of the weight you lose right away will be water loss. After 10 weeks, a person could lose 35 pounds easily, leading him to be tricked into going off the diet. I did this. I lost about 18 pounds, but quickly gained 13 back. The net loss of five pounds wasn't bad, but had I done things properly, I can only imagine where I'd be. Do not be fooled by the rapid weight loss; let it inspire you to keep going."
2,Works great (at first),"I've been on Adkin's plan for about 3 months now. For the first 2 weeks of the diet, I lost about 10 pounds, and was initially pleased. However, I have only managed to lose another 5 pounds since the first 2 weeks! I think Adkins does bring up some valid points regarding the biochemistry of the diet, but overall I am not very pleased at the results of this plan. The writing style of Adkins gets a little old after awhile, as he's trying to persuade you that his plan is the best, and everyone else is wrong. One word of advice while you are out shopping for all your meat, eggs, and butter, buy a can of Metamucil, you are going to need it!"
4,SORRY I QUIT,I WAS DOING SO WELL ON THIS DIET AND WITH ALL THE HYPE I QUIT. WELL THAT'S THE SORRIEST THING I HAVE EVER DONE. I AM MUCH MORE IN DANGER OF HAVING ILL EFFECTS BEING SO OVER WEIGHT. I AM BACK ON IT AND THE RESULTS ARE AMAZING.
3,Revised???,"The book which claims to be a revised version was not proof read. The book seems to have been slapped together in a hurry. You will see what I mean when you have to re-read a sentence 2-3 times until you realize you didn't read it wrong. It gets to be really annoying. It's a good thing the good Dr. was never an english teacher!!! I've been on the diet for a week or so and feel alot better, but I am still on a restricted diet!! You have to limit your intake of sugars, white flour, starches etc... But you can eat all the fat you want!! I guess you can't win them all!!"
5,THE BEST THING EVER HAPPENED TO ME!!!,"I just want let people know that Atkin's Diet have helped me so much!!! I've lost aprox. 80 pounds and from 46"" waist to 38 in 4 months and I feel GREAT!!! I am diabetic and now I don't have to worry about my glucose levels since I'm not consuming any and humans lack the enzyme needed to transform fat into sugar. Well... THANKS DR. ATKINS and I encourege anyone that want to lose weigth to join the list!!!"
4,This diet works but leaves some questions unanswered.,"I was on this diet back in MAR of 99 and lost about 10 pounds and felt great about myself especially since i just had a baby in DEC. I went off the diet and back to carbs and you can guess from there. I started the diet back on the 15th of Sept and now the seventh day, and I have lost four pounds. I have quite a few questions though that i wish i could email the dr with and get some questions answered. Anyone who has had success on the diet and don't mind helping me pls email me. I am the only one on the diet in my house and need some help. All in all the diet is the only thing that has worked for me cause i have a big appetite. If you email me, address the subject as DR ATKINS.... or i delete names that i don't recognize. Thanks and good luck to all who are on this ""Diet Revolution"""
3,question,"i did try it myself last year (august) and it did work. however, after the holidays such as thanksgiving, x'mas, new year, and all these happy holidays, unfortunately..... i think it is so hard to go back to the 2nd time because of these social evnts. many foods are hard to elimiate especially dine out. i would give this diet a 5 stars after trying so many diets, this was the most effective one. however, due to the frustration on choosing foods which is kinda unclear, i have to give it a 3 stars. but overall, i do believe it is very effective. is possible to have a list of foods is not allowed under this diet. been an asian, there are a lot of foods that i don't know if it is okay to consume or not. so, if possible, please advise. such as sushi (raw fish), seaweeds, and etc..... thanks a lot."
5,"For me, there is no other way to eat than the ATKINS way.","I have been on the Atkins program for the last 2+ years and it has changed my life! I lost 25 pounds. The miracle is, it has stayed off. His book was so enlighting to the malady of carbohydrates. Since being on this program I have learned what my body can and cannot handle. I still may have a carbohydrate binge day but, as Atkins says, I start over the next day. It works it really does. When I am eating according to program I feel so much better, sleep better and have more energy. I just found the web sight for Atkins products, what a treat this is going to be. Thank you Dr. Atkins! I love you and my new life."
2,This diet is not supported by Mayo Clinic.,"After carefully checking the Mayo Clinic website, I found that they do not support or recommend this diet. Therefore, I now find it hard to put any validity in the book at all. I wonder how many other inaccurate statements might be contained that would effect my health. Prehaps you will want examine the website and then change yours."
5,This diet works - FACT,"There are a lot of words coming from the nutrionist out there that don't make sense. Dr. Aykins and Barry Sears are showing us the truth through real weight loss. I and my of my friend really have some lots of weight on this diet.Great book outline why, what, and how. In great detail."
5,It does everything it says.,"If the diet is followed by the book it does everything it says it will do. After reading the book, the diet begins to make sense."
3,Couldn't get through the induction period,"I needed to lose about 20 pounds mid-life weight so, about 6 months ago, I gave this diet a try. I found the induction period too difficult. I was nauseated, tired, headachy and could not even muster enough energy for my daily walks, plus I was constantly craving carbs. Neverless, I did lose about 5 pounds and think Atkins could work for people who are extremely insulin resistant. I have since followed the guidelines from the book ""The Schwarzbein Principle"" and found this eating plan much more suitable. This plan is similar to Atkins but allows some carbs and unlimited non-starch vegtables. I've have lost weight with such, but more important, I feel great and do not suffer the mood swings and carb cravings that have plaqued me in the past. I highly recommend it."
3,"Tired, hungry, and GAINED 5 pounds!","A lot of my friends have lost massive amounts of weight. If you only need to lose 10-15 pounds, this probably won't work for you, either. The book, did, however, give a lot of insight about how carbohydrates can work against you (like my Coca-Cola habit....) PS. DON'T skip the fiber laxative!!! :)"
3,Atkins Diet-Will it Work?,"I read the Atkins Diet over the weekend and found it to be very interesting. I have to admit, I've only been on the diet for two days. I am already feeling sluggish and have a headache.. I need feedback from anyone who has been on this diet."
4,Dr Atkins' New Diet Revolution,"I have read Dr. Adkins New Diet Revolution book and have followed his advice and started the diet. I am in my 8th week and have lost 20 lbs so far. I plan to stay on it for as long as need be. (This could be forever! The diet is easy to stay on with no ill effects. It works for me. However, I wish they did not have so much negative press from so many. It seems they have something against you Dr. Adkins. Old or new the diet works on is safe as for as I'm concerned."
2,What am I doing wrong???,"I began this book with many positive comments from friends and family! I faithfully read the pages with excitement, tossed my carbos and sugar treats and whole heartedly began my diet 9 days ago. I ate with caution and regarding every sentence of the directions and have lost nothing. The LTS strips showed heavy fat loss for 4 days, then nothing. The book says it could be a motabolism problem, but there is no explination as to what to do after following every direction fails. Help!! Where is the answer to this problem? It is not in the book that I can see."
2,No Success,"After nudging from a coworker I tried this diet and I stayed on it for the entire 14 day induction period. I went into ketosis as promised but did not lose a single pound. It seems this diet works for some individuals-just did not work for me. I am athletic and work out 3-5 times a week lifting weights and rollerblading. This diet left me feeling sluggish. My coworker hower, has lost a great deal of weight using this diet-but has regained a bit and is now following the induction diet once again. Simply, this diet did not work for me although it seems to have worked for others."
5,"Excellent, Helpful, My dream come true",I am just finishing the first week of this diet. I have lost 12 lbs and feeling wonderful. I also have my husband doing it. Great Diet. Never hungry.Lots of energy. I have lots of weight to go so I will keep you posted.
3,"good at first, gets real old real fast.","Meat, eggs, fat, cheese, nuts, etc. etc. etc. Yeah, it works. I won't deny it. I lost 30 lbs in no time. But, then, after awhile I couldn't stand the thought of eating bacon and eggs for breakfast--AGAIN!! I missed fruit and vegetables too much. To be successful with the diet, you must love the protein-rich foods and be willing to give up everything else forever. Or you'll gain it right back like I did."
5,All I can say is: THANK YOU DR. ATKINS!!!,"For those of you that have tried diets and have been unsuccessful, this book will explain to you WHY. I read the entire book before I started the diet and each and everyday referred to it for advice and menu planning. The explanation he gives for the way the diet works make so much sense that I wondered why I hadn't figured it out on my own! The meals are wonderful. I only hope that Dr. Atkins creates his own recipe book! It would be a SURE bestseller! Thanks again, Dr. Atkins!"
5,I had given up!,"Until a co-worker turned me on to Dr. Atkins Diet. I was really skeptic, but got the book and gave it a try.Three months later, I have lost 35lbs, RIGHT THROUGH THE HOLIDAY SEASON! All I had to do was skip the deserts and potatoes. The Prime Rib, Steaks we great! While all of my friend added weight, I lost.I do wish there was a simple answer to the vitamin and other pills. Dr. Atkins brand is VERY expensive."
5,I'm a believer,"I began the Atkins New Revolution Diet Program in early September. Some 14 weeks later, I had dropped 37 lbs, My blood sugar has gone from 300 to 104, my triglycerides from 400 to 175, my cholesterol from 250 to 195, my blood pressure from 130/90 to 110/70 at the last visit to my doctor. It all defies the logic preached by all the dieticians of the world as well as the AMA.My own physician has started the program after having patients try low-fat diets that brought down their blood chemistry numbers somewhat, but never lost any weight.I can understand the AMA preaching that this diet doesn't work....IT GOES AGAINST EVERYTHING THEY'VE PREACHED FOR YEARS! However, you can't argue with success. I have tried numerous dieticians' plans, the American Heart Association's diet plans as well as the American Diabetes Association plan of exchanges and have NEVER had the success I have had with the Atkins New Diet Revolution.I'M A BELIEVER! IT WORKS!"
5,He didn't do it right!,"The guy who said he lost 20 pounds but felt horrible wasn't following the guidelines of the Atkins diet. You're not supposed to pig out on meat just because you can. You're supposed to eat moderately. I seriously doubt eating a pound of bacon for breakfast is very moderate.I'm just starting the diet and I already have a lot more energy. I had to try it after I saw my friend, who has already lost 30 pounds after about 3 months. This diet is safe, healthy and a great way to lose weight--if you do it correctly."
1,DEVELOPED HEART DISEASE!,"I thought all these protein books were super until I got my annual exam and had my cholesterol level checked. It turned out it had become sky high and that I had made my heart disease worse! THIS BOOK IS NOT HEALTHY! Don't buy it. It's not worth risking your life for this scam book. The so-called ""doctor"" should be ashamed of himself. My personal doctor suggested a book by Gary Rempe and it worked really well and actually improved my health a lot in the process. Don't waste your money and your life on this book by Atkins."
1,this diet stinks!,"I followed Dr Atkins advice for two months. Nothing but meat, cheese, eggs etc. This may sound like some kind of nirvana until you realise you can't eat buns with your burger (or fries), no taco shell with your taco, no base for your pizza, no bread for your sandwich...I feel I was missing out more than ever on this diet. But worst of all my bad ""ldl"" cholestrol went up, i suffered from headaches and dizziness most days, my breath stank and i was always constipated.Oh yes i lost some weight. And now i know why most people lose weight- you can only eat so much protein. By cutting off an entire food catergory you will, of course, lose weight- that's obvious.But i can assure you there are much healthier and in the long term more effective ways of losing weight. This diet really does stink!!!"
1,Don't take the Atkins steak-and-eggs bait! This diet is nuts,"Iam 38 years old and am about thirty pounds over my ideal weight. I tried the Atkins diet out of desperation after years of trying so many other diets. This sounded like the perfect diet for me. If I could eat meat and heavy cream and LOSE weight - COUNT ME IN! Maybe this diet works for those needing to lose 70lbs and more - but I LOST NO WEIGHT. I did not cheat at all. I followed the rules to the letter. Now I know Atkins says that there is a small percentage of people who will have this reaction, so I give him that. But the truth is, NO FAD DIETS WORK. If you want to read a good book - read Dr. Dean Edell's ""EAT, DRINK, AND BE MERRY."" That book is a real wake up call for all of us seesaw dieters. It is so great to read a book that tells the truth - FINALLY - about dieting, exercise, and so many other health related topics."
3,"It works, but there are better options","The diet certainly worked for me, but I found it hard to stick with. Timothy Ferriss' ""4 Hour Body"" offered an option that worked better for me, and I reviewed that as well."
3,Readers Bonanza,"I personally would rather a straight forward ""DO THIS"" approach, rather than all the explanations and history of this diet. I think a book on ""why"" and a book on ""how"" would have set me in the right direction much sooner. Over all good book however."
3,Very popular book!,"Everyone is reading this book. No book will cure all the problems with diabetes, obesity, etc. However, the approach here is scientifically sound. If millions of them used the Atkins way and worked, then there is merit to the system. My question is, how can a person, who is under weight but with high triglycerides, benefit from this book?"
4,Bizarre horror movie that never takes itself to seriously. That's A good Thing.,"A lot about this movie is bizarre. I'm not sure if it's purely from the cultural divide or what, but it's very refreshing. Most films in this genre fail miserably by either trying solely to gross you out or are just boring carbon copies of the many other horror films out there. A great quirky horror flick, don't miss this one."
2,What the hell?,"Good movie, scary, original..?? are u guys serious ? i think this one is crappy, lame, dull.., bla bla..., ""dark tales of japan"" is far better than this trash. but i still aprecite this movie by give it 2 stars, make movie is not easy, i know that and still apreciate their works, thank you."
4,A scary thriller!,"In the tradition of a Gooosebumps fil m, this movie is very unique! colombia pictures video is my favorite studio and this was distributed by mirimamax! I think it is a very scary opropriate for all ages flick! I loive good scary cinema like this! I can't see Scream, but i bett this is even better! One scene was stupid about a dumb women panicked, otherwise great!"
2,Definitely a TV movie,"This movie is cute, definitely a TV movie. The story is sort of infantile, not really believable. But it's fun, and I think kids would like it OK. Go see RSTC or Spy Kids, though, if you want something a bit more fun."
5,Inspiring!,"I purchased the Kindle version for a class because I was short on time. After reading through the book and seeing the patterns I realized I needed to print them to scale so I purchased the hard copy book as well. Wow, it is so much easier than I imagined!"
2,What's it for?,"Of the first seven (non-technical) words I searched for in this dictionary, six were absent. Also, there are no word derivations. Simply awful."
3,Assumptions of Yesteryear,"It was overall a sound piece of writing and research. However as the title suggests, she assumed to know the type of woman and how her surrounding environment would influence her and that is something she can not research."
4,Is What it Is,"A good read if your into peasant life and such, history buffs too, otherwise, it's a pass."
4,Fruits,"This is an interesting book. The author/photographer documents street fashion in the Harajuku district of Japan. Each page is a photo of an individual and a brief description of their outfit. If you are into this style of fashion, this is a book worth owning. The only short-coming is that the descriptions are printed in colored ink and sometimes get lost in the background color of the photographs."
5,Kawaii!!!,"This book is a launch pad for creative dressing. Page after page of people playing almost every type of character from being the hippy to being the gothic lolita. After looking through this book, I have finally started making my own clothes. My favourite character was the person whose ""fashion point"" was to dress like a ""suspicious looking woman"". This is FUN! This made me realize that I should dress more like the weirdo that I am. This book has connected me towards my inner being. haha."
1,Fruits is a Fraud,"Fruits purports to be photos of people picked at random from the streets based on their unusual outfits. In my opinion, all the subjects are models, dressed by a designer. Maybe they thought that westerners would not notice that all or most of the women and men subjects are photographed more than once. Some show up again and again. In my opinion, the photographs are staged and the outfits are not the creations of the people who are photographed. Notice too, how all the outfits are top notch from head to toe. You would expect to see a few ugly or poor decisions if the photos were of real people. Take a look if you are interested in how to try and dupe the public."
5,delicious fruits,"Ah to be young and colourful again!This book is absolutely delicious! No unnecessary commentary, just pages after pages of full-length colourful pictures of the fashion fruits on the streets of tokyo. It is liberating to see these kids go wild with color. Something happened on the streets of Japan that gave them the permission to scream out their individuality, and their sense of humour and joy of life jumps out from the pages of this book. They are adorable, and funny, and rebelious without being offensive, and kooky, and free, colourful, sweet, innocent, sensual, alive ... and the book doesn't preach anything, doesn't try to explain, just acts as silent observer.Excellent!"
3,Happy driver,Desperate for a rear view mirror I quickly purchased this one. These arent the best you have to be careful and don't push or pull on it because it easily breaks!
4,standard,a standard rear view mirror.fits the old standard mount on the windshield with no problem.the only down side is that the tightening screw is star shaped.who use a star shaped screw anymore?
5,I am driving legally when it comes to mirrors,"I don't want to get pulled over by the fuzz for having a broken rear view, and the OEM is expensive and/or unavailable. This works. Now I can get back to illegal racing, drug muling, gun running, and going on the lam. If you see an outlaw driving around the suburbs of Seattle in a Kia Sedona minivan, his eyes glued to the mirror, he has his eyes out for Johnny Law. Best give that bad man plenty of room, but keep in mind that if you want to lead a glamorous life of crime like that, you may need to buy the windshield mirror mount cement to glue this onto your own getaway car. That appears to mean non-GM or Ford vehicles like the KIA. You will also want to carefully scrape the old mount off with a thin scraping device so you can install this higher on the windshield. Now go out and do some crimes.Not really."
1,Product Swap,"I as well received a Donnelly 240 mirror instead of a Cipa 32000. The Donnelly mirror is not dimming correctly and I am returning the product. I'd much rather have the rectangular Cipa mirror over the oval Donnelly (which I've never heard of) Be careful..There are other websites with the Cipa mirror for similiar prices, you may want to check them out.Justin"
5,Is a rear view mirror...,"It is clear and the flip thing works fine. It fit my stock mount on my windshield perfectly. It does come with a mount for you to use, just no glue. But, as I said, it fit my old one with no problems at all."
2,"the performance is good, the footage sucks","it's grainy, there are no scene selections or any frills to the dvd, and the camera never does any close ups or anything interesting. the performance is obviously passionate and austin shows some good swagger with his guitar, but i would recommend this to completists only."
5,No nonsense in this one,"I highly recommend this book! I like the way the author didn't waste my time trying to include little jokes to spice up the text. Every feature was covered in complete detail. I read the book from cover to cover and immediately became a master at using Fireworks 4. Previously, I had been using photoshop to make my web images and effects but since reading this bible book I haven't touched Photoshop. Fireworks is a great program and if you want to learn all of its capabilities then you should own and read the Fireworks 4 Bible."
4,Great Book for someone new to working with cars,"The photo illustrations in the book help show people what a particular part looks like, even though it is in black and white. The highlight in orange of a particular part described can help point out a part of the car, in order to easily identify from its surround parts of a car. The book gives some website to find information whether it would be about car buying to other automotive consumer information. The book, however does not go too much into detail of each parts of the car. This maybe good for someone who know very little about cars. The book looks easier to read and understand and should not be too overwhelmed by the information given in the book. However, if a reader wants more details and are less worried about photos, then Auto Repair for Dummies would be a better choice."
1,Are you certain you are a complete idiot ?,"The only fault I can find with this book is the misleading title. I thought I had purchased ""The IDIOT'S COMPLETE Guide to Car Care and Repair"" and in fact had purchased "" The COMPLETE IDIOT'S Guide to Car Care and Repair"". This is a book for someone who has never changed his/her own tire, never looked under the car or in the hood, and couldn't tell the difference between the radiator reservoir and the window-washer reservoir. I needed a book that would guide me to do repairs with confidence, this book really just skims the subject and is not a very good step-by-step manual for anyone other than a professional mechanic, who wouldn't need it to start with. I do not recommend this book for a person who is interested in getting dirty, and gave it 1 star as 0 wasn't available. To sum it up, for an at-home do-it-yourself-mechanic who needs to start somewhere, this is not the one and for those, this book is more a ""bandaid"" when a ""tourniquet"" is needed."
2,probably better to buy the hardback version,"I bought the digital version for kindle through amazon. The diagrams are almost absolutly undecipherable. It was a really bad scan I guess. Also the book repeatitly refers to a car care card that you are supposed to fill out and refer too. Does not appear to have even been scanned in the digital version.It would be nice for amazon to whispernet associated PDF forms for books that have inserts.I give this book a 2 because it really does have some well written care care info. I wish I could give it a higher review, but books of a technical nature really do need to have clear diagrams to be complete."
5,Children with Tourette Syndrome: A Parent's Guide,"This book is an excellent resource for parents whose child has Tourette's. It explains the disease, treatment, interventions, resources, and so forth. Excellent and easy to read. Great resource also for those with ADHD, especially since ADHD and Tourette Syndrome sometimes go hand in hand. I highly recommend it both as a grandparent of a child with both Tourette's and ADHD, and as a health professional!"
4,Great book for parents!,This is a great book for parents of childen just diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome. Very informative and gave me the tools I needed!
4,Easy to use,This software is easy to use. I have been using Memorex CD/DVD Labelmaker and software for about 2yrs.I use a Lexmark 4 in 1 printer and my CD/DVD labels turn out great.
1,Labels May Destroy DVDs.,"From the last page of the manual:""WARNING: ... Using a standard or full-face label on DVDs may cause permanent damage to your disc. To reduce risk of lost data, use the center only label for all DVDs. ... ""In other words, don't use these labels on DVDs, or label only the central 1.5 inches of DVD.Other brands guarantee their labels to not harm DVDs. That guarantee is little comfort if in 20 years the DVD is unreadable, but shows other makers have confidence in their brand.The label applicator can be replaced by an empty blank DVD spool."
