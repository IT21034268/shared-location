4,Happy Mom,Fabulous! This is the best nipple cream ever! I like this so much more than the other products out on the market. It is a little greasy but it helps heal the cracks and pain associated with pumping and breast feeding. The jar is tiny for the price but a little goes a long way! A definite buy!
2,Greasy - Ruined my clothes!,"Bought this b/c of the reviews, thought Id give it a try. Like others say, it is very thin and seemed to do okay. It's not great, but not terrible. I liked the lanolin better though b/c the texture felt better to me.Also, it ruined several of my clothes. It stains and does not come out, buyer beware."
3,On the fence....,"I ordered this after having severe nipple pain for a long time (6 weeks) and after getting my latch corrected and using this nipple cream and lanolin, my nipples have almost healed. So, how much this product helped, I'm not sure of, but it was a part."
3,You can get cheaper,I was not greatly impressed with this product and I wondered if it was because I didnt suffer as much as other mothers did with crack bruised nipples. The product looks and smells like petroleum jelly. I got the impression that you can use any grease like or moisteriser on your nipples and get the same result. I guess the only difference is that this product claims to be digestable. So I guess it may be a bit more convenient to use than having to rush and wash your nipples each time you need to nurse.
1,Its not a miracle cream.,"After reading the reviews I thought this has got to be a miracle cream. I havent had any of the results people are reporting. I feel like this product was 100% useless. Pretty much a waste of my time, and money."
3,Okay for minor soreness only,"This product was okay when I had minor breast soreness, but as my little one and I struggled with latching it wasn""t enough to help. If you are suffering from soreness and cracking, buy Lansinoh Lanolin. I found relief from lanolin in a few days."
5,Very nice,It works very well even if you're pregnant. I'm due in a couple of months and already have nipple issues and this helped a lot.
3,"I love the natural aspect of it, but...","I used this while I was in the hospital after delivery, and I liked the natural aspect of it, but it stained the insides of my nursing tanks (because of the olive oil, I suppose), and wasn't as water resistant and protective as the Lansinoh product I was given by the nurses."
5,Great Service - Quality product,Neil Sedaka CD: Order to delivery service was simple and easy. The product was delivered in a reasonable amount of time and the CD was in excellent condition. I would order again from this company.
1,Leaks,Upon second use the device leaks propane where the top outlet connects to the tube. I could feel the gas shooting out the side so fotunately I did not use it in this condition.Since I did not save the receipt the one year warranty is useless. The manufacturer wanted to charge me $25.00 to inspect the product plus $12.50 return shipping (plus my shipping to them). Way over the price of a new one.I bought a different brand to replace it.
1,Cracks in hose,"Just wanted to report a possible safety concern regarding this product that I purchased a little over a year ago. While switching out propane tanks, I noticed a few cracks in the hose, and can smell the odor of propane emanating through the cracks. I haven't been taking the tree of the tank very often since I leave it on there all the time to cook with the grill on the porch. Only time it was taken off the tank was when we went camping last summer. I called the company to inform them, and was told the report would be passed to the production department. When asked if they would replace the item or conduct repairs, I was told since it didn't happen when I purchased it then they wouldn't assist me any further in the matter. I was instructed to take the item back to the place of purchase to seek a refund or replacement."
1,Stalled with 3 connections,"If I tried to use 2 stoves with the unit, it would shut down and go out. If I only used one stove and the lantern on top, it was fine, but lighting a second stove, it would seem to just close off the gas and everything would go out. I thought maybe my tank was too full and the tank was shutting down because of too much gas coming out but I tried it later on a bigger tank that was at least half empty and the same thing. It has been years since I bought it and plan to toss it and buy another brand."
2,Not Worth It.,This album is not worth the buy. This album was released after the huge success of the original album. It features more '60s songs but was just made for money and it did it. It still sold 4 million copies. This album is just filler from begging to end and is just pure junk. This is not a buy!
3,okay,CD quality is good. I was surprised at the songs. I expected them to be more like the ones in the original recording of DD. Guess it just wasn't my taste.
5,AWESOME!,"The music to this movie is excellent, but I own the anniversary edition cd with all of the songs/music on one cd. More convenient than having all of the issues and reissues. And the anniv. ed. has all of the tracks in order so they play as it does in the movie. Wonderful."
4,What I was waiting for . . .,"I bought the first album expecting to hear all the great music and was very disappointed. When I then saw this one in the store, I was very excited because it had all the music that I was expecting to be on the first cd. I'm so glad they made this one too. I highly recommend buying this cd if you want to hear all of the great music from the movie."
4,excellent oldies,"I actually liked this collection better than the first CD. I bought it for Do You Love Me (Now That I Can Dance). There are great dance songs, and Wipeout is a great road-trip drum-along song."
3,"Helpful, but somewhat complicated to use","Product was applied to a cockroach and ant infestation area at home. While the number of roaches and ants did decline to more acceptable levels, the application was laborious, not to mention that re-applications have to be made frequently.If you don't have special application equipment (my case) you're reduced to puffing the powder using the ketchup bottle lid provided. It works, but its clogs, applies unevenly, and requires constant shaking.Overall, I'm somewhat satisfied with being able to use a less toxic product to control pests and plant to continue using it, but I'm not about to start promoting it to other people because there's a chance they could become frustrated."
2,CRAP,"I never like to give bad reviews but this product is worthless I must say, and to have read the reviews regarding it I have to wonder??"
3,dont know yet,i just got it today and put some in some areas in the kitchen where its not close to food.im freaking out a bit that the roaches dont spred this on the dishees or silverware so that we get inffected.im also pregnant so im more scared because of that.i hope it works and we are safe
4,Very Good Information',A very interesting video of what women would like guys to know instead of hitting on them in a lame pick-up type fashion...very interesting and informative'...M.H.'
5,Essential Ubu,"This is a collection of the group's earliest and best singles on the Hearthan label. A great band straddling punk/new wave, art-rock, progressive/electronic, avante-garde,or ""avante-garage"" as they call it. All these tunes are strong and a better representation than some of their albums which tend to be a little uneven, with the exception of The Modern Dance and Dub Housing which are still from the early period and very excellent."
5,Poetry + Halloween = Fantastic Little Book!,"I am a halloween book addict. The first step is admitting you have a problem. I have a huge collection of books on halloween ranging from the history to postcards to stickers to ephemera to decor, ghost stories, monsters. I do not have a poetry book about halloween. So when I saw this, my jaw fell open. And I bought it. And I love it. I love the vintage looking cover, the text the poems are printed in... The poems are really great because naturally being poetry they have a rhythm to them and you just get caught up in the spooky story being told through poetry. How awesome is that! The best imagery is with poetry I think and this just fantastic. The poems have different categories too which is great. For example, hags and beauties, dangerous procedures, a choice of ghosts...If you love halloween as much as i do first buy this book, then get help."
5,great buy!,"nice color and made very well! makes the backyard look nice although it's covering the table. this cover, covers both tha table and chairs!"
5,Excellent book for the web!,"Oustanding job by Lynda againg! This book is fully color illustraded, specially for Mac users, but covers windows too you will be up and running in no time, creating navigation bars, buttons, rollovers, animations, if you learn by doing, you got a have this book! it is just excellent!"
3,On Target,"Was looking for a book that was more advacned. This one is clear and she puts on great presentations. The book though could be more detailed and help with trouble shooting,"
5,An integral part of an elite game system,"Rolemaster is gaming grown up. Far more intricate and subtle than D&D. The system uses d100, and makes use of all the possibilities that entails. You'll need substantial intellect to make use of it, but the reallism compared to other systems is worth the effort to master it. As an example similar severity strikes in D&D and RM would yield, respectively, 14 hp damage compared to 14 concussion hits and a c slash yielding ""slash muscles and tendons in foes shield arm, +9 hits, foe bleeds at 4 hits per round, stunned for 6 rounds, arm is useless"". Once mastered, the game flows well. It's nickname of ""chartmaster"" is well earned, but the charts provide depth, not needless encumberance. Each component, such as ""arms law & claw law"" is designed to be used as part of an entire system, or as an adjunct to other game systems to add to their reallism. I believe you will get out of rolemaster what you put into it, modified by your memory and reason stat bonuses."
4,Essential for Rolemaster.,"It's essential to play Rolemaster, for it contains details and tables for the combat sequance. If you wish to play Rolemaster it is a must buy."
3,lack of cd room,"Book is excelent, but I'm not agrre on the fact thah te book doesn have cd room. I hope I can find it."
1,Poor quality due to shipping...,"I was very upset when I received this item. I ordered it as a gift to my husband, as this candy is not available in our area. It was shipped in a regular old cardboard box, and I was home to receive the package. Thank goodness I was, because it was 90+ degrees outside, and the candy was already sufficiently melted. He can't even enjoy his favorite candies, as they are melted to the sides of the package. I was not happy to have spent nearly $20 on candy, only to have it arrive in an indigestible condition.With that being said, this candy is delicious in it's true, unmelted, form. It's one of our favorites. However, if we were to ever buy it again, we'll have to go out and search for it, since shipping is apparently a terrible idea."
2,Not What I ordered,"I ordered the holiday ones for my kids and got the regular. They tasted good, but my kids were disappointed to say the least"
1,Hobart Plasma Cutter,"We received the cutter (reman) and we STILL haven't got it to work. We understand that it can't be returned, but instead, must be sent off to a service center. We've had it 30 days and its never worked yet, and we're faced with sending it off. Who knows if it will ever work. We're DISSATISFIED."
3,By-the-numbers uplifting story with a dark background adding depth.,Very good but not great by-the-numbers uplifting story about kids and old people and education being a good thing and how you gotta show some resolve and determination develops a dark undercurrent and unexpected depth as background and history are revealed to the audience.
4,"Well made, slow pace",A very well made movie based on true story. A bit slow paced. A story of perseverance in an unjust world.
5,An extraordinary man,"I just love films about extraordinary people - it is so inspiring to watch what some people can achieve. And this is such a film to love.This 84 year old man decides to learn to read and write and is so determined to do so that he can endure almost anything and in the end he even ends up in the UN in New York to tell about the power of reading.He has endured lots of horror in his life, so him being this strong, wise, gentle old man is amazing and inspiring.Highly recommended."
4,A Vivid Account of the Civil War Wounded,"I loved ""Hospital Skeches"" by Louisa May Alcott. It tells of many wounded soldiers that Louisa actually met in her nursing period at the Georgetown Hospital. It tells of Sergeant Bane and his ""Dearest Jane"", Doctor P., the 'quiet sleeper', who ""would like a drink of water, if you ain't too busy"", Billy, Kit, and many others. The only things that I didn't absolutly love about ""Hospital Sketches was the font, which was difficult to read, and the fact that Louisa herself isn't the exact main character, name and all. However, Nurse Periwinkle, who replaces Louisa, is an almost carbon copy of Alcott, so I can't really complain. People just don't write books that are as good and as true as this anymore. As I said in my title, this is a truly vivid account of the wounded men and the nurses in the Civil War."
3,Not up to Alcott's usual standard,"Feeling useless, spunky spinster Tribulation Periwinkle volunteers to nurse Civil War wounded. After a grueling trip, she arrives at her assigned hospital and cares for injured, ill, and dying soldiers. But she sickens and is unable to continue nursing.Knowing Alcott actually nursed wounded during the Civil War, I had high hopes for this book, and the second and third quarters of the book comprised an amazing if excessively emotional portrait of caring for the injured and wartime Washington itself. Wading through the narrator's trip from Massachusetts to Washington, D.C. took up the first quarter of the book, and the last quarter was a disjointed addendum following some of the characters after they were discharged from the hospital. Not one of Alcott's better stories at all; mostly interesting as a look at the period."
3,Worth the trouble?,"Quick and interesting read on Ms. Alcott's experiences as a nurse during the Civil War. Unfortunatly, the print in the book was very hard to read making it hard on the eyes, but worth the trouble if you are interested in the Civil War era."
3,A curiosity,"I read this book because I had never heard of it and it was mentioned in ""Eden's Outcasts."" It was interesting as a biographical moment in LM Alcott's life. Some of the sketches were informative and heart-wrenching. But it was a bit amateurish (no wonder, as she was still an amateur), and it was more like a pamphlet than a book. Still, I am glad I read it. If you are a Civil War buff, you'll get some valuable, detailed information about hospital procedures and the sheer lack of medical care, expertise, and supplies--even in DC."
3,"Very prosy, not her normal style","I found I liked the story once I could ignore the comparing everything to everything. Really not her usual writing style, and glad its not, or I really wouldn't like this author. Her observations about patients and doctors rings very true, and could easily have been said about today's hospitals, though the story takes place during the civil war."
2,I thought is was ok...,"At first when I got the book I was expecting stories about the soldiers and Civil War more then a first time nurse. The book starts with two really boring first chapters that tell about her trip to the hospital, and then finally starts up with her time spent helping patients. Though it never tells in depth anything about the wounded. It is more about how Lousia May Alcott and other nurses handled the jobs given them. I was expecting something that would make you sympathize more with the soldiers then a nurse, and something that would bring you into the time and setting. I learned nearly nothing about what it was like for the soldiers from this book, I only learned I don't like Louisa May Alcotts writing style."
2,What happened Jayne?...,"I've been reading and loving Jayne's stories for years and years! This book has me stumped... The story line was great as far as the suspense and intricacies of the plot ... but, the characters' love stuff was terrible! The few times they made love, it was over in seconds every time! I can understand that happening once ... But, ALL the love scenes were kinda' ""wham, bam, thank you Ma'am""! I was astounded! Why would anyone want to have that kind of sex life?!?!? I realize that some people do, but that's not why I've been reading Jayne's books for so many years. There was a lot missing in this book. I was sorry that I bought the Hard Cover ... My advice (if you have to read this book anyway...which I would do myself despite any reviews :) is to wait for the paperback or buy a cheaper used one! I love you Jayne, but please work on the love scenes more next time!..."
2,What has happened!,"I have read all JAK books (also those under Amanda Quick and Jayne Castle). She is an excellent writer and by far my favourite. I waited in eager anticipation for Lost and Found to be released. But something was lacking in this book. I found myself bored and skipping pages. The element that is JAK simply was not there, I found her usual wit and the chemistry between the couple saddly lacking.I hope this was a one off and look forward to reading Slightly Shady in April. Hoping it meets her usual excellent standards that set her apart from other authors!"
2,Should have read the reviews before buying...sigh...,"No excitement, no ""get my blood pumping passion"", minor character developed in the story (NOT!) is murderer...just all around disappointing."
2,Large Disappointment,"I have read many of Jayne Ann Krent's book and this is the last one that I will purchase, especially a hardback!!There is no romance, zero sensuality,a poorly constructed ""mystery"", and no meaningful conversation between the couple. In the last few pages there is a marriage proposal that had no build up and the heroine is totally surprised that the hero is in love with her. Save your money and get this at the library. I would ask the author to return to the romance genre and stop trying to write a mystery novel. I miss the wonderful writing she did in her romance paperback releases."
3,Intriguing,"While I enjoyed this book it wasn't one of her best. I've read several of Ms. Krentz's books as well as those she has written as Amanda Quick. Her historical romance books are by far my favorit. Making the change to her contemporary suspense/romance novels has been interesting. While I was stumped as to ""who done it?"" until the end there was something lacking in this book that I've found in her others. I'll continue to read both her historical and contemporary romance novels and I suggest that you give her other work a try before reading Lost and Found."
2,At least it looks good.,"I am very dissapointed with this product. I bought it because I already had a Laserline 200 tower that I've been very happy with. Unfortunately, the 2 don't compare. The tower itself looks good, but does not have the strength to hold 300 CD's. At only half full it barely spins. It also leans. I spent 50 bucks...and am still shopping for CD storage..."
3,excellent styling if you can fill it,"The title says it all. I have a 300 capacity and a 200 capacity. The bigger it is, the more unstable, however. Only get one that fits your collection, and what you plan to buy soon. Or plan to distribute the weight evenly. Other than that, when full or nearly full, it works like a charm."
1,Not enough info given,I might have ordered this product if you had given the dimensions. There is not way for me to determined whether it will fit into the space I have.
1,Hope your arm is strong!!,"This sprayer really works pretty good, though the capacity is so small. It takes about 50 strokes to get adequate pressure after filling, and you must repump after a few minutes of spraying because the pressure will drop. I also had problems with air leaking from the piston which allowed me to exercise my arm even more. Still, I was able to finish my project and even had a well-exercised arm to boot!!"
5,You Will Watch This Movie Twice,"Just when you think you have it figured out . . . .Yeah, worth buying because you will watch it twice."
4,Tense B Movie Thriller,It starts slow as the audience is introduced to several 30 something couples vagabonding it on vacation in Hawaii. About an hour into the movie there is a palpable sense of menace. It delivers with some nice twists in the last 30 minutes. Lots of great Hawaiian scenes in between. Give it a try - if you can take movies with a bit of character development and the patience to wait through a story - you'll probably like it. I wish there were more thrillers like this out there. It's pacing is kind of a throwback to the 70's and 80's. It may not make sense but in a way it reminds me of Pacific Heights with Michael Keaton and Matthew Modine - although not that good.
3,"Worth watching,if you have some time on your hands","I tried to watch this film about 10 times,and fell asleep everytime.I finally got to see ""A Perfect Getaway"" last night.The best part is seeing Hawaii.I was there in 1996,and its beutifull,and the movie brings back all the wonderfull memories.I don't want to give the movie away,but I knew right away who the bad guys were,and you don't find out untill the last half hour.I can see why ""A Perfect Getaway"" wasn't a huge hit,but its worth watching if you have the time."
2,HONEYMOONERS & SERIAL KILLERS IN A TROPICAL PARADISE,"For years I've been an enthusiastic fan of both Mila Jovovich (FIFTH ELEMENT and RESIDENT EVIL) and Timothy Olyphant (HITMAN and the DEADWOOD series on HBO), but this film is a clunker. Before you spend any money buying it, I would suggest that you view a rental copy first. Better still, if you can watch it for free during a plane flight, so much the better. I seriously doubt you would ever want to watch it a second time.Basically, if you like cheesy serial-killer movies with lots of violence, then you'll love this. If you don't, you won't.People who are hidebound by logical consistency and do not appreciate plot holes might also want to find something else to spend their money on, because this film not only misleads viewers as to who the serial killers are--it outright deceives them with false information.Otherwise, within the narrow limits of the genre, the ""acting"" is adequate, the stunts are well performed, and the scenery is very nice."
3,A Perfect Waste of My Time,"This movie is a real disappointment. First the movie starts off slow, gets a little interesting, then gets boring, and finally ends with a horrible twist that didn't really make sense. It actually made me a bit mad.I really have to say that this movie is among the worst I have ever seen. So, if you like boring movies that make no sense and has a ridiculous ending, then by all means get this movie. However, if you like really good interesting movies try something like The Mist, Hostel, or A Tale of Two Sisters which are a few of my favorite movies."
2,Girly man,"I rented the flick due to one of the positive reviews (""Pleasantly Surprised""). I'll know better next time. Zahns character is the biggest whimp that frets like somebodys overbearing mother. No woman (especially a Milla type) would ever marry this guy, hes a total whuss. I couldn't take anymore and had to turn it off."
1,"Ugh, horrible.","I don't know what kind of crackhead gives this movie a good review, cuz it sucks. Horrible plot, bad dialog, lousy acting and implausible story. Save your money and the two hours of your life that you're considering wasting on this piece of garbage."
1,Terrible,"Same old stuff as we've all seen in countless other suspense movies. Predictable, I liked him in ""Management"", here not so much"
1,the perfect getaway,I really can't review this movie due to I never received it and did not receive any follow thru regarding this issue
1,Totally A Waste Of Time,"I actually paid to watch this stupid film in theatres and after watching it, I was like, WOW, what a ****ing waste of almost two hours!! I own a lot of DVDs, but I wouldn't even keep this turd if someone gave me the DVD for free. I enjoy Timothy, Steve and Milla, but this was just out and out hilariously stupid."
4,A great mystery that will have you guessing right up to the end!,"This is the ideal mystery movie - one that leaves out all of the obvious foreshadowing and just leaves you guessing up until the endo of the movie. The casting is great, the locale is refreshingly natural and interesting, the dialogue is believable, and the acting is top-notch. I really enjoyed this movie and can't say much about it without spoilers, so I'll just leave you to go view it for yourself. Next time you hear of a friend planning a trip to Hawaii, have them watch this movie first!"
5,A Perfect Getaway,"This movie was well written and the actors chosen for the characters they portrayed only enhanced the overall picture.The script kept you wondering who the real villians were, each time you became confident of who was who, another event came into play. I would recomend this to any individual who enjoys thrillers and ""who done its."""
5,Crazy-Good!,"The first time I saw this movie, I was completely saturated in the storyline...never expected what was to happen later!"
2,okmovie,ok movie --- like Timothy Olyphant -- but not his character in this movie. Thought the part where it shows his head injury is dumb.
3,outstanding <watch it and you will understand>,"ok, so it's not the BEST movie and until a friend recomended it i never even heard of it. my friend is infatuated with Timmothy Olyphant. it was a lttle on the predictable side and way to formulaic for me. the acting is not great, the script leaves a lot to be desired. there are just better Olyphant titles out there that are better....such as Justified"
3,predictable,"I loved the scenery in the movie and am ready to jump a plane and go camp in hawaii. i had never thought of it as a place to camp. So that gives it a star right there. The story was predictable and the killers were a no brainer as to who was who but none the less it was a fun movie to watch. The whole hunting the goat and skinning it and eating it was funny, like so contrived. But then, so was the whole movie."
3,exciting flick but implausible,"I enjoyed A Perfect Getaway very much while I was watching it because it keeps you on the edge of your seat trying to guess the identity of the killers. And it ended with a viscerally satisfying destruction of the bad guy. The problem, though, is that when you find out who the killers are, it doesn't add up. Too many things happened earlier in the movie that showed that they couldn't be the killers. In other words, if they really were the killers, there's no way they would have acted the way they did or said the things they did earlier in the flick. Just doesn't make sense. So I was pretty disappointed by this. Nevertheless, I do recommend it for a fun 2 hours. And the scenery is spectacular and will make you want to visit Hawaii."
4,"A FUN THRILLER MYSTERY, BUT VERY OBVIOUS!","Beautiful locations highlight this modern ""whodunit"". With a good cast and this kind of scenery, you can't go wrong. I like this movie a lot, but I figured out ""whodunit"" about 30 minutes in to the film.....although I wasn't completely sure for another 10 minutes, so it held my interest because the cast was fun to watch. It's not the best film of this nature, but it is certainly worth seeing. It's kinda like a thriller romance film! :-D"

3,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...],"This is not a bad movie, however the big twist wasn't such a surprise. It was actually really good and seemed like something different until the the last 45 minutes or so, then it got a bit more clique. Overall, fairly entertaining and worth the time."
3,Entertaining Suspense/Thriller,"One of the higher-profile suspense thrillers of '09, The Perfect Getaway is an entertaining movie with a good premise, however the last half or so falls into the trap of clichés...not to mention a few random acts of ""hokey""-ness. Still, it overall is entertaining and at least attempts to make some original story and cutting methods and deserves a positive rating. Viewers shouldn't expect much more than an hour and 45 of decent suspenseful entertainment, though.This movie more-or-less met my expectations. Fans of such movies like ""Touristas"" should like it (though this wasn't nearly as gory as ""Touristas""). Ultimately I was expecting a nice ride that was entertaining, along with some decent acting and those characters that seem to come with this kind of movie....and this lived up to it! Best line of the movie... ""I never watch the news...it's like, too informative."""
1,Avoid this,Of course Morton's music is superb. The trouble here is that you hear so little of it because the transfers are strangled to death. A big disappointment. The JSP box offers far better sound and value and does justice to the music.
3,Shoddy mastering on half the songs,"This would be a five star CD as it contains essential songs from the Hot Peppers and rare Jelly Roll piano solos, but the mastering is completely unnecessary. I've compared the songs of this CD to Birth of the Hot, and the songs all sound like they are muddy and if you listen to Freakish on this, it sounds like a bass guitar more than an actual piano, that is how compressed the mastering is. Some songs aren't too bad and listenable, but others just sound nothing like the way they were intended. I would avoid this and just get the JSP box set or Birth of the Hot as it contains almost all the songs in this and the mastering doesn't take out the harmonics or sound fullness that was meant to be on these songs."
3,a Marsalis pick,"Wynton Marsalis picked The Pearls for one of his ten examples of ""real jazz"", in Sweet Swing Blues on the Road (p 140). He did, however, warn his readers to listen to the music, and not the quality of the sound!I'd rather not rate this myself, but the stars are a ""required form field"", so I'm giving it the average rating of the other reviewers."
4,Good quality for the price,These are spot on for the price. I have used them a few times and they get the job done correctly. Recommended for light use.
5,KD Tools 445 Internal Snap Ring Pliers,"I've had these KD 445 internal snap ring pliers for years and really like them. They work great and have saved some serious time in removing internal snap rings often use in recessed areas inside appliances and power tools.The pliers came with five sets of different sized interchangeable tips that have held up well with use. The tips are also available separately from K-D for replacement if you happen to break one. I like that the interchangeable design of these pliers gives you a little more flexibility in adjusting the tips when needed, which you don't get with single size fixed tip snap ring pliers, but the tips are slightly angled and a little short, so may not be long enough to fit down into some deeper recessed areas."
5,Nice piece for the price!!,This piece of hardware is well made and it seems to me very durable and reliable. Good tool for the price!!!
3,it's a good fake watch,"it's a fake watch. But it's good.There are 3 levels of fake swiss famous brand watches .The worst is made in hongkong, china.The ok level is made in Japan.The good level is made in swiss, yes, made in swiss, but not the original brand factory.This is the good level."
4,Big and Beautiful,"This is a large watch, not for small wrists or the faint of heart. If you like a nice size, solid watch, this should fit the bill. It gets attention and compliments every time I wear it. I love the unique shape and look, I only gave it 4 stars as opposed to 5, because the champagne colored face makes it a little hard to read and the snake skin band tends to flake a little. If this watch had an easier to read dial (ie. more contrast) and a heavy leather band like my Russian Diver watch has, I would have definitely given it 5 out of 5. Over all though, it is a very eye-catching, attractive watch."
3,"Nice,very nice....however","the LUPAH""S are unique,eyecatching watches.I really love the one that i wear .The one that i received had a manufuctures defect ,but i could tell from the quality of workmanship that it was no big deal ,so i ordered another and it is my favorite watch in my collection of six ..on the other ""hand"" ,no pun intended Amazon has as yet not credited me for the one that had to be returned....it has been nearly a month.Still i am sure that i will be purchasing more INVICTA""S"
2,Not as good as my other sticky pads...,"I love the color and this one works well, but not as great as the plain old sticky pads. If I could have gotten them in color, I would have."
4,The faithful shall be rewarded,"Martin Vetterli is the foremost researcher in the area of wavelets in signal processing, and one of the best presenters whom I've met. That may be sufficient to convince some people to buy this book, but may discourage others from buying this book.One thing to keep in mind while reading this book is the following: The faithful shall be rewarded. If you're uninitiated, this book can be very intimidating, and Martin goes through the first parts (considered to be review) a little bit hurriedly, all the way through the end of Chapter 3.But once you get into Chapter 4, you will be treated with an excellent coverage of why wavelets are so great, and the state-of-the-art of its research and application. This is where the two authors truly work their magic in their writing.Even as you try to get past Chapter 3, there are many gems to be discovered, for example the proof of the ambiguity function in time-frequency analysis."
1,stopped working on day 2!,"I wish I could rate it with 0 stars: after taking less than 70 pictures on day 2 it sent me an error message....sure it may be ""just a lemon"", although we don't know yet percentage of lemons among these cards."
2,Poor image,The Stones at their best and more relaxed than ever. The image of the DVD I was sold though is terribly poor. Looks almost like a blown out quick time movie. For [...] it's a rip off.
4,Another fine effort from the Boys from Bethlehem,"The Sins have been creating fine and consistantly great underground garage rock for many years not. They have, in the past, been able to attract the attention and respect from many artists, including luring Peter Buck of REM to produce a cd for them. This new release is a worthy addition to the Original Sins catalogue. It finds the band tighter and stronger than ever. The Sins will never stoop to being commercial or selling out, but they will never be ignored. Play this one LOUD!! Annoy the neighbors...it's ok, it's rock n' roll."
4,Are you ready to be scared out of your socks?,"What is it about this book? It was given to me by a friend who said a local woman wrote it and you know how that goes... Well boy was I wrong about that. I'm about the age of the woman who is the protagonist here and I found it easy to identify with her. Her dog is a great character and adds much to the story as well. This is a nailbiter, and not nearly long enough. I never wanted it to end!"
3,good shoes,"i like the shoes but i assumed that since kamik boots are made in canada, the shoes would be too. Unfortunately, they are made in china, so not worth the amount charged for them."
4,son loves them,my son loves them. I know some parents hesitate to get velcro shoes but my son is autistic so these are excellent and still make him look cool.
2,hobart ac welder,worse welder i ever used............do not buy...........go with the ac model.it works well. i have never been more dissappointed with a hobart like this before...thats why they stopped making it
4,a real find !,"This is a hard to find Chet Baker disc, recorded in the studio in Milan, Italy in 1977. I found the accompanying liner notes, which are very poorly translated from Italian to English, to be unintentionally hysterical in their attempt to mimic the writings of a ""hip"" music journalist. They read as if they were composed by someone who poses himself as both a critical thinker with poetic leanings and a sociologist who sees, in Baker's breezy emotionalism, a well-defined political force. I consider it an important addition to my collection of 20+ CDs by this artist ; previously I had no representation within this time period. Thank you, Amazon ! Please continue to add new titles to your Chet Baker repertory. I look forward to hearing from other Chet Baker fans around the world ! lmnoselli@att.worldnet.com"
1,Not very exciting,"This book is packed with information, unfortunately very little of it is useful. I purchased it for my school work and was unable to use it as source material. The book is layed out with a bunch of statements that Artistic directors should follow and then it lists how or why Artistic directors should follow them. It dosen't really cover much ground that is useful for a small time director or artist. If you were managing a large scale theatre than this book might be helpful to you."
2,Vinegar Hill,This book went no where. You are thrust into the life of an unhappy married women who has no idea what she wants to do or what to do about it. Nothing is ever accomplished in this book. She makes no decisions and nothing happens. It almost made me happy to read it because my life will never be that boring.
1,bitterness is not good for the soul,"I began, and finished Vinegar Hill upon the suggestion of a friend. I found the seeming stream of consciousness pleasurable and refreshing - sometimes she loses you when jumping from character to character, but I didn't mind it - it was more or less poetic and dreamlike. However, I found that each and every tidbit of information made me sadder, and more bitter, and not even able to place myself into Ellen's frame of mind or situation. I would like to write more, but, I will say only that I really didn't like the story - it left me empty, bitter, and just ""dark"""". Don't forget - I DO like the style of writing. I am interested to read other books by the same author as long as I don't feel like jumping off a bridge, not that I would, at the end of it."
4,Couldn't Put It Down,"I am a very busy person but I made time for this book. I read it cover to cover in 3 days. The story was very eye-opening about how quick people are to accept the ways of society just because ""it's the way things are"". The story made me what to jump through the pages and shake the main character and scream ""hello--do what makes you happy! "" I really felt for what the characters were going through and I kept on reading hoping they would somehow get a happy life. The only draw back to the book was that there isn't anything really uplifting going on. I myself am getting married in a few months and this book gave an interesting perspective on what unhappy married life can be like it made me pull back and make sure I was doing the right thing--and I am!"
4,I throughly enjoyed this book,"Yes I bought this book even after reading the discouraging reviews. Yes it is a dark book, at times I could only read for 15 min. before I had to put it down but then picked it up again in 1/2hr. What you have to remember is the times, being the 70's the church was still rather stringent. You see Ellen going through misery after misery and you want to say ""Hey girl get out"" but you have the pressure of family and church keeping you in a bad situation and it's easy to see her plight. It's remarkable that she did make the decision that she did. I would encourage anyone who enjoys a book for making you stop and think to read this one."
4,Gut wrenching,"I found this novel hard to put down. Even in the most tormenting moments of this family's life, they were irresistable and human. Their hatred and their love was confusing and depressing but so real that it compelled the reader to see what would happen next."
2,An incredibly depressing book,"About a third of the way through this novel, I put it down. As with every Oprah Book Club book I've read, it is thoroughly depressing. Sometimes Oprah books work out alright: the characters start making smarter choices and their situation changes. But it doesn't appear this will be the case with this book. Having read dozens of reviews, I find that it will remain a depressing story about a woman whose husband moves them back into the home of his cruel and abusive parents. And it gets worse from there. Although the writing is excellent and I can ""see the movie in my head"" (literally see it happening), I prefer books that are at least eventually somewhat upbeat. Not fairy tale endings, no. And not without conflict, because there's plenty of conflict and heartache in real lives. But not through and through to the end. Already I'm thinking, ""Is she EVER going to leave that whipped husband of hers and get her young children away from that jerk father-in-law?"""
5,Loved This Book & Surprised by Negative Reviews,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and could not put it down at times. As others have mentioned, it is in no way a feel good book (well it may make you feel good about your own family and trivial problems). At times, I was literally gasping out loud. However, the more disturbing parts of the book are well spaced and are not dragged out in detail like some other books (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo). I will definitely recommend it to all my friends!"
3,Vinegar Hill,"Vinegar Hill is a beautifully written novel- engrossing and for some reason difficult to put down. I think this may be because one is waiting for ""the other foot to drop"" the entire novel or for some direction or decision to be made. However, I think the author's intent was to envelop you in the world of these characters and the fact that the novel does not seem to move much is a reflection of the lives of the protagonists who also seem to be stuck in their places. After reading this book, I felt a deep sense of sadness. This is not a book for one who enjoys a quick-paced action packed read or for people who enjoy a more dominant and take-charge main character."
3,The Title is Exactly What it Says-Bitter and Angry,"This book is all bitterness and plays the scene of a highly dysfunctional family.It is 1972 when cicumstance carries Ellen Grier and her family back to Holly's Field, Wiscomsion. Dutifully accompanying her newly unemployed husband James, Ellen has brought her two children into the home of her in-laws on Vinegar Hill-a loveless house suffused witrh the settling dust of bitterness and routine. Cruelty is a way of life, preserved and perpetuated in the service of a rigid, exacting and angry God. Behind a facade of false piety, there are sins and secrets in this place that could crush a vibrant young woman's passionate spirit. And it is here that Ellen must find the strength to endure, change and grow in the all-pervading darkness that threatens to destroy everything she is and everyone she loves.The book is a bit disjointed in places and was bit disappointing to me. There was never a happy moment in it."
4,Glimpse of dysfunctional Catholic family in 1970s,"An easy, engaging, enlightening read. My favorite part of this book is, while most of it is told from the main character's perspective, you are given chapters from the point of view of other characters. You realize there is so much behind an action that you initially interpretted one way. This strengthens the ability to understand, believe, and empathize. It makes you reflect on how this is true in your own life too.This story can be toxic at times but so can life. The portrayal at first seemed unbelievable (I kept thinking why would someone put up with that?!), but I started to understand how different times were during the 1970s. And how different they are in a 1970s Catholic household (although 30 years probably hasn't changed as much as I would hope when it comes to the Catholic church)."
4,"Sad, very sad","Well written, very sad story about abuse and how the ""nurture"" aspect of a family presents itself in future generations, both good and bad. While this story takes place in the Midwest, the family dynamics could occur any where at any time. Not my favorite book by any means, but still an interesting read."
3,"Dark, dark, dark","We all know people who struggle to stand up for themselves, who get caught in lifestyles we think we'd never tolerate. We also know their thinking is different from ours and that we cannot judge them for different thinking. Unfortunately, this makes this book no less frustrating. The reader surely wants Ellen to stand up for herself and leave her loser husband, if not for herself then for her children. A casserole over the head of the hateful in-laws might have also been in order. She leaves at last, but it almost seems too little too late."
5,Long Journey,This book was like a long journey. I loved it. It was a great story. I even felt like I learned something. I couldn't put it down.
4,Captivating In A Disturbing Way,"'Vinegar Hill' was very easy to read, yet at times I wanted to toss the book out the window! I couldn't help but feel sorry for Ellen Grier, the books main character. Her life is less than ideal, and I felt her discomfort throughout the book. I have not read any other books by the author of this book, but I will add them to the list of possible reading. The author makes the characters come alive with description and thought. In the end, I was glad to see Ellen get herself and her children out of the mysery that had become her life. It was an uplifting ending to a disturbing tale of abuse, both mental and physical. I would recommend this book to others without hesitation."
1,OPRAH WHAT WERE YOU THINKING???!!!,"I will never read another Oprah-recommended book. After barely making it through ""The Pilot's Wife"" (another piece of garbage recommended by Oprah) I decided to give this book a chance. I didn't think it possible, but this was even worse than TPW. Possibly the most boring book ever written. I think I got to page 45 and then I threw it away. Do not waste your time. I don't know what else to say....."
4,An Enjoyable Read,"Kinda wicked, kinda crazy, but definitely a good read. The writing was clear, the story moving. I view this novel as a reflection of how blind faith can lead one astray. Although an excellent tale of one's ability to endure and overcome, I was slightly disappointed that Ansay didn't expose us to the new Ellen, strong and confident, sturdy and assured. Even though most of Oprah's book seem to have a similar theme (struggle, oppression, eventual self-actualization), she does an excellent job of selecting novels that cover the theme creatively, and realistically."
3,tragically depressing,"Although vinegar hill is beautifully written, it's twisted characters make it difficult to turn the page. Also, it is too much of a cliche to base all of life's difficulties on organized religion. The element of mystery kept me reading to the end, but I would not recommend this book."
2,Family cries,"The book was a page-turner, thought-provoking, but not entertaining. It has a dark, brooding sense of family, with no place to go. Each character has it's own destiny, but it didn't tie together. The secret sins may have unearthed emotions that were understood, but not necessarily dealt with. Also, no inner light was shed on Fritz, to circumvent his nasty behavior! The ending wrapped things up in a hurry, thank goodness, giving us some promise of hope. If the author's intent was to carry us into the reality of a dismal family life, it rallied!"
3,Too Cliché,"The themes in this book are not new or original, and the stereotypes drawn on German-Catholic-Small Town- Midwesterners are almost too pat. I found the pace rather slow, and was waiting until the last sentence for Ellen to get a grip, get her children, and get out. The plot thread of the two murdered infants was just a little TOO easy, yet at the same time too preposterous to be believable. It seems hard to believe that in the late 30's/early 40's, the deaths of two infants would go unquestioned. I wasn't convinced that Mary-Margaret's character was so warped because of her abusive husband. And the elderly aunt: the name Salome didn't seem believeable either, and her character was really nothing more than a sinister hulk in the background.I've read much better books, but this one wasn't the worst I've read. Just wish it had been a little more satisfying."
2,Skip It!,"This book is extremely depressing from beginning to end. I found very little redeeming in it. You do get to find out why the characters are so horrible, but by then you don't care. This book went right into my garage sale pile after reading it. It is not one that I would pass on to a friend."
2,Vinegar Hill is fitting title,"--as this is the sourest, most depressing bunch of people I've read about in a while.I assume we were supposed to feel for Ellen as she struggled against oppression, but I found her and the rest of this crew totally unredeemable and tiresome.Beyond the morbid turn of the story, there are too many side stories and subplots that leave you wondering, ""Why?"" or just, ""Huh?""I bought this book about a week before it hit Oprah's list. If I'd known she was picking it, I probably wouldn't have bought it as I have found most of her picks to be celebrations of whining women or minorities. The only one of her picks I've really enjoyed was Ernest Gaines', _A Lesson Before Dying_."
5,"Not an uplifting read, but a profoundly moving one","This is a book I couldn't put down, as it follows the life of a woman inching toward a new sense of her own identity, and coming to head with her husband, family, religion and culture. It takes place within a deeply conservative community, and examines with grace and care the roots, meaning and impact of such a world on its members. Though the outer conflicts (the ""drama"") in the story are muted, the depth of the inner struggles and fears are so carefully protrayed that it makes for a highly dramatic story. Six months after reading it, it still haunts my thoughts, expands my understanding, and populates my mind with strong images."
1,AWFUL,"I could scarcely get through the first chapter..who cares who got what part of a dry roast and how they chewed for three pages. The underwear discription was the last straw!....""practical panties, with blood stains at the crotch, perhaps, or elastic sagging at the waist. James wears boxer shorts with flies that are stained the pale yellow of daisies""....I'm supposed to sympathize with this supposedly educated woman who has never heard of bleach? It seems to me that this book is an insult to rural German Catholic families. I logged on to read other reviews, and find I'm not the only person who wonders what Oprah was thinking of to recommend this book."
2,vinegar is right,"I read this book as part of a book club. We were trying to get away from depressing books, to those with a bit of happiness. Well, we were dead wrong! It was grueling to get through this book, let alone actually discuss it. To the author's credit, the book is well written, the characters are beleivable, and the title is truly a fabulous description of the contents. BUT if you are looking for a bit of happiness in what you read...this book is not it! A. Manette Ansay allows us only a brief glimpse of happiness and this only towards the bitter end...if you don't like to feel good at the end of a book, pick this one."
2,I kept waiting,"I will give this author points for prose and description, but I kept waiting for Ellen to break free of this bondage. Very disappointing ending that left me totally unsatisfied. After all of the depression, I think that anyone who suffered through the entire book at least deserved a decent ending - not necessarily uplifting- but something with finality."
4,Depressing Episode of Life,"I really enjoyed the book. It is a quik read, but it certainly had impact. This book reveals how short life truly is and how it is so necessary to rid yourself of circumstances/people that contribute to the demise of your own self worth and hapiness."
2,Bitter as vinegar...,This book left me cold. The stuggle between feminist independence and old style religion was too cliche. I had a hard time liking any of the characters. They all were content to accept their meaningless lives. I had heard good things about this book and was eager to read it. I would not recommend this book.
4,"Can't say I enjoyed it, but....","I had a hard time putting this book down because it was as well-written as it was depressing. I was so pleased when Ellen finally got the gumption to make arrangements to leave that pit of hell and useless husband. Remember, this was set 20 or more years ago, in a small backwards town where these family secrets and abuse were tolerated and not spoken of. Look how everyone - EVERYONE - was against Ellen's leaving, her own sisters, the clueless priest. One of the reasons I stopped attending church was that backward attitude."
2,Disappointing,"I can't imagine why this was an Oprah selection. It was an unappealing tale filled with flat, unlikeable characters. The plot did not flow. Numerous inexplicable things occurred. Why did the father give the farm to a hired hand when he had so many sons? Where did all these sons go? Who knows? It is one of many events that are never explained. A poor book."
4,Vinegar Hill - Worth the Climb,"An intense, strongly written book! The subject, of a family moving back to live with with hellish relatives is depressing, and Ansay sugar coats nothing. From a psychological standpoint, the story shows how one event (in this case loss of job) can completely devastate and alter personalities, leaving family members trapped and unsure of what to do. Not a happy story at any point, but well written and impressive."
2,Very sad and depressing!,"I recently saw A. Manette Ansay on the Oprah Show and was very impressed with her as a person. She captured my attention and her personality was engaging and delightful. Vinegar Hill, like many other of Oprah's recommendations, describes a woman's struggle and the way she deals with her life and inner-self. In Vinegar Hill, the heroine, Ellen, unfortunately doesn't really escape and make her situation better; instead the reader is left asking, ""Why doesn't Elllen react? Do something? Go to her own family for help? "" Rather depressing. The rest of Oprah's books, especially Where the Heart Is and The Book of Ruth also describe a woman and her battles, and in these the woman does triumph and find her seemingly lost spirit. Vinegar Hill is extremely well-written, I just wish the subject were different and characters more likeable."
3,"Good read, but hard to follow at times.","This is a good book to read, but sometimes it is hard to follow a few of the characters. A few of the characters come and go so frequently that you have a tendency to forget who they were in the beginning. What happened in this story probably happens more often across this country than most people realize. Definetely not one of Oprah's better choices, but I am glad I read it."
2,An annoying book with annoying characters..,"I really couldn't get into this book at all. I found each of the characters self centered, including the main character, Ellen. True she was trapped by circumstances beyond her control at first, but as the book progressed I found her decline into drug use to numb her pain while she allowed her children to continue to be exposed to the behavior of the rest of the family very irritating! There wasn't one character in the book who I could feel any emphathy with. Not my kind of book at all."
1,Slow and Boring,"This book was so SLOW, BORING, and depressing. There is no real storyline and I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone."
1,"Nothing interesting happening, didn't go anywhere!","So a woman lives with a lunatic, cheap, family. Nothing happened. It delves into the past of other family members for nothing critical to the story. I didn't get it, and was surprised that I could read the whole thing and not know anything."
1,Vinegar Hill,"This book is not an easy read! I have to present this novel to my reading club in two weeks, I don't even want to pick the book back up! Come on OPRAH! Did you even read it?"
2,A Dark Cloud,"I found Vinegar Hill extremely dark and depressing. Although the writing was very descriptive, page after page I waited for something positive to happen to Ellen and her children. Not until the last passage of the book did I feel there might be a light at the end of the tunnel for them. After finishing this one, I felt a dark cloud hanging over my head. I have enjoyed many of Oprah's Book Club selections - this was only the second one that has truly disappointed."
2,A Morbid Book,"The book is morbid. Pessimistic and sometimes simply ghastly. Ellen does not know what she wants. There seems to be hatred everywhere and no character is well defined except maybe Amy's (?) The reader keeps waiting for something definite something that will finally emerge from the haze but is sadly disappointed. Nonone in the book is sure whether they can be happy or disgusted about any particular thing and what is left is a a half-formed unhappy taste, a feeling of unsurety and ambiguity. A book that I would have gladly missed."
1,UGH,"I just finished reading this book... some of the descriptions were vivid..but the plot was difficult to follow... was it about a cranky, hateful, mother in law.. an abusive spouse... a miserable woman trapped in an unhappy marriage ...or murder of babies for vengeance???????? I kept waiting for the climax ...sorry but I thought I wasted my time reading Vinegar Hill it left me with a sour taste ..."
2,"""zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz""","I enjoyed the writer's style but felt the story had much more potential. Not a great ending at all. The main character (Ellen) who is used and abused throughout the story, just doesn't seem to get the justice she deserves. ""Where the Heart Is"" blows this one away."
3,Vinegar Hill a bitter tonic,"Dark and depressing with a mildly triumphant, but anti-climactic climax. Generally good character development, yet lacking slightly with respect to the antagonists. My nomination for the Kervorkian book of the month club."
2,BORING,This book won a few awards. I don't understand why?!?! All I can say is BORING BORING BORING. I have a little empathy for her but this book just drags on and on for nothing.
2,Black Cloud,"This story starts out with a family in financial difficulty which causes them to need help. The family moves in with the husband's parents. The plan is for them to stay for a short while until they can get back on their feet, but the stay becomes indefinite. Disfunctional is not the word for both the family and the husband's parents. The whole story is about the way each person handles problems incorrectly. The wife is the most stable one in the house and even she has her difficulties in handling situations.Although, in the end she finds herself and makes a future for her and her children. I did not injoy reading the book. Life has its peaks and valleys. This story never brings life out of the valley. I would have enjoyed the book more if there had been some happy times once in a while. Don't read this book if you are going through a rough time or if you battle with depression. The events and the plot of the story will only add to your saddness."
4,An eye-opening book to another reality,"Honestly, I am glad that I finished reading this book. It is very depressing and I cannot understand why the main character keep on going for so long under the circumstences that she is in. However, I realized that I had learn something from another culture from another era in this country, and how women had endured the situation with so much courage and dignity. The language is fluid and very readable, the author shifting back and forth from the past to present time. But as I mentioned earlier, I'm breathing more freely now that I finished the book."
2,Could not finish it,I bought this book to read on an 8-hour plane ride and could not get through it all. I kept waiting for something to happen.
3,"Now, I am really depressed","I was really not in the mood for a depressing book when I started Vinegar Hill, and that is exactly what this book is, so perhaps my opinion is slightly biased. However, I ended the book fed up with the fact that there are some women that settle for ho-hum mediocrity in life and love, and was thoroughly depressed for not only Ellen, but her messed up family as well. I also, incidentally, wanted to yell at my significant other for anything he did that wasn't 100% nice due to the anger and frustration I felt upon reading the novel. It is well written and sends a message, but I think I would have been in a much healthier state of mind if I had only read the back of the book."
3,"Wonderful prose, but a bit depressing","I am a voracious reader, and read about 2-3 books a week. I bought this book on the advice of a good friend and also because it was a selected Oprah book club book. The prose was very good, and although I enjoyed the way Ansay wrapped the words around my mind, the story remained a very depressing black cloud on the whole. I was not happy at what should have been the happy end. I felt even a bit empty after reading this book. It is the first book of Ansay's that I have read, so I will try another and hope that the bittersweet taste in my mouth is dulled."
4,So true to life its scary !,"As a 39 year old married man from a small town I see real life all through this book. Fritz is not able to break the cycle of the overbearing person he is, just as his son can not pull himself out of the hole his father pounded him into. I think all of us feel like Ellen from time to time in our lives. This is a very good true to life book I enjoyed the lessons it taught me."
2,"A strong start, but lacked closure","After hearing many positive things about Vinegar Hill via Oprah and other reviews I decided to purchase the book. I completed the book yesterday and I can't help but feel a sense disappointment at being left without an adequate ending.I have not read any previous works by this author and I don't feel I'll read anymore. Vinegar Hill was very well written, the author has a wonderful 'story' telling ability, the language used was perfectly crafted and the character development was wonderful. Ms Ansay has a definite gift for writing but I was disappointed with the ending. I felt the author conjured a great visualisation of the characters but the ending seemed hasty and lacked closure.All in all a wonderful character portrayl, the author draws you in to really feel the characters pain, the story line is poignant but tragic, I feel Ms Ansay could have done more with the ending."
2,Bitter tale indeed,"Ansay gives us an anguished portrait of families trapped in a cycle of violence, stifled by religion and small-town culture. Ellen bucks the system by being a working mom, but when her husband loses his job must move in with her in-laws, and is exposed to their vitriol and dark secrets. This book is disturbing on a number of levels, and not for entertainment at all. I found the story extremely realistic but the ending all the more unsatisfying because although Ellen plans to escape, it leaves the guilty unpunished and the scars to her children unhealed. I'd rather have a happy ending,and I finished this book feeling sick. Two stars for gritty realism, but this isn't ""light reading"" or entertaining at all. Be warned"
4,A promising debut novel,"A. Manette Ansay is one of my favorite authors. She struggles with two powerful forces in her personal life: an upbringing deeply rooted in Catholicism and a mysterious debilitating disease that saps her strength and endurance.In Vinegar Hill, Ansay's debut novel, Ellen Grier, too, is struggling against two forces: she's trapped in a difficult marriage that comes with some pretty sanctimonious in-laws and by, guess what? the demands of her Roman Catholic religion. Because of financial problems, Ellen, her husband, and their 2 children have returned to small-town Wisconsin to live with his stolid and alienated/alienating parents. Everyone is this little microcosm is suffering, a theme that Ansay has carried through all her subsequent books.This isn't Ansay's best book, but it was a good start to what followed. Don't miss her memoir, Limbo. When you read that, you'll recognize details from her life in her fiction."
1,Vinegar Hill,"This has to be one of the most depressing books I've ever read. Ellen needs to snap out of it and get a back bone. I have never met anyone who dwells on death, much less a whole family who thinks constantly about dying. I had to make myself finish this book hoping that it was going to get better, only to be deeply disappointed that the Ellen that was evolving was then cut off for no one to see."
1,Extremely Frustrating,I cannot get over how frustrated I was while reading this book. There seemed to be no happy moments and worst of all the main character had no backbone. I wanted to reach through the book and slap her. I was so glad when it was over.
3,Bittersweet escape,"Ansay engaged in a novel about a women supressed in a marriage that committed her to subordination. Ellen the main character attempts to subject herself and her children to the ritualistic abuse from her husband, his family and her family. A woman before her time escapes; she pervails and eminates to become the role model in her family. Easily read, with an ending that can satisfy most feminists. Nice job Ansay."
2,Depressing book,"I was very disappointed by this book. It was depressing, gave me a negative view on following your religion, and I didn't feel attached to any characters."
2,I bought the audio book,"Listening to this tape was frustrating because you kept waiting for something to happen,and nothing much did happen. The characters were abrasive, of course, and so was the reader's voice. Ellen was always so quietly sweet, that you just wanted to shake her to wake her up! Couldn't she scream at someone just once? Maybe she did-- maybe I just happened to fall asleep while she screamed!"
1,A very depressing book,"I found this to be a hard read....and not a very good story line. The lead character is a weakling from the very start...so husband loses job and wants to move home with mommy.....NOT! Tell the bum to look for a job or throw him out...from the very beginning it was predictable that this woman was going to go through hell.....and it was of her own choosing... I have read only one other book from the Oprah Book Club that was worse than this one....Remember the one where a Mom goes to her reunion with her CHILDREN....what kind of person goes to a reunion with her children....come on Oprah, give us something better to read....."
3,Vinegar Hill - Left a sour taste in my mouth,"I chose to read Vinegar Hill because it was an ""Oprah's Book Club"" selection and have been mostly satisfied with other selections I have read. A fast-read book but very disturbing. At first, I felt sorry for Ellen but by the time I got half way through the book, I wanted to ask her ""what are you still doing there?"" If I had had in-laws like that, they would most certainly be my ex-in-laws and it wouldn't have taken me that long to leave."
4,worth your time,"I just finished ""Vinegar Hill."" Although some have thought the book was a waste of time, I thought it was a worthwhile read. Her words flow smoothly, and I had no problem staying with the story. This story may not be light-hearted, but if you have ever been in a bad relationship that you've had trouble leaving for one reason or another, you will be able to relate to Ellen."
1,predictable-boring- blah blah blah,"The title of my review pretty much sums it up. The first Oprah book I read was wonderful (She's Come Undone, Wally Lamb).... but every since then they have been just awful. All boring, all predicatble, all 'poor me, what can I do to get a new life?' stories. This was the last chance I was taking on Oprah selections. No more. Ever."
1,a bore from the begining,I waited and waited for something to happen here and nothing ever did- I was bored from the begining but could not believe that nothing was ever going to happen- it was one of the most pointless stories I have ever read- The only thing that kept me from giving up was it was an easy read- not to wordy
2,sad but realistic,"Easy to read, but sad in the way Ellen put up with her family. The realistic part comes in as in many dysfunctional families today, whether it is alcohol or drugs or watever secrets there are from the past, and whoever is in charge of taking care of that family will find it is easier to go along with things than to make waves. Until the one in charge has the strength and courage to escape that way of living, it's unbelievable what the person will put up with."
1,Vinegar Hill,"I'm so glad I didn't buy the hardback as I rarely do with new authors and new books. I like to save my money for hardbacks that are REALLY good books and this is NOT one of them. Vinegar Hill does not allow you to get close to the characters... none of them seem real and I don't like books that start a trail and never go back and finish the road. There are several gaps, several characters introduced and then never brought up again, just poorly written. I compare this book to The Pilot's Wife which I also couldn't get close to and understand. I read both of these books just to finish it. I never hated to put it down as I do with good books. A real disappointment."
3,In-Laws from Hell ................,"This is a story of Ellen Grier who together with her weak and unemployed husband and her two children return to the small town of their youth. As a result of financial problems, they move in with her irascible and depressing in-laws.A strong tale of misguided love and loyalties, shocking secrets and loveless marriages in the 1970's. A time when there was no support groups and women had few choices if any, and a time when divorce was not an option.Ansay writes well. Sadly though I have read too many other sad tales of dysfunctional families which seem to be ever popular at present - they do not interest me.Overall a very well written book if you are interested in this genre."
2,Don't waste your time.,"Vinegar Hill is the most depressing book I've read in months. About a woman trapped in an unhappy marriage and a completely unsatisfactory living situation, this tale goes from bad to worse. Although the writing itself is not bad, there is no climax, no ray of hope to keep the reader pressing on. As you turn the pages, you just find out one more terrible thing after another and you wonder if Ansay is clinically depressed or driven to write her autobiography or someone else's. What else would drive a person to write such a novel? Don't read it if you have faith in marriage and family life. It will just dash all your hopes and dreams."
3,"was very descriptive, but","As an avid reader of a variety of subjects, I did not enjoy this book. The writer was very descriptive with the characters, but it is a very sad depressing story that affected me for days! I am not turned off by trajedy, but this is not even good trajedy! If you want a good read, please look elsewhere for something more cheery."
2,Vinegar Hill,"I was very happy to be done with this book! It was torture, with every turn of the page I thought that the main character would get a clue, defend herself, stomp kick whatever it took. I never felt that things would really change for her."
3,"Heartbreaking, involving, yet strangely incomplete","This book was so depressing, so real, that I was only able to read it in small doses.The book does have several fairly well-developed characters. But don't expect them to come to any mutual understandings or tearful resolutions. There was no upside, but perhaps that was the point."
1,"Vinegar Hill; Sour title, sour book","I could not recommend this book to anyone and it baffles me that it has received such enthusiastic reviews. I felt no regard for any of the characters, least of all the main character, Ellen Grier. The other's had no redeeming qualities to speak of. I continued reading until the end, hoping that Ellen would drum up the courage to leave that wretched home. She ultimately made her decision but it came in the last two sentences of the book. It seems that the author had written all the horrible anecdotes she could think of so she decided to end the story just as soon as she let the readers know that Ellen would make up her mind. The end was abrupt and it left me feeling as though I wasted far too much time reading it. Life is short and there are so many wonderful books worth reading. Don't use up the time on this one."
4,"a ""brilliant, bitter book""","One of the back cover reviews said this was a ""brilliant, bitter book"" and I agree. I found this book hard to put down--I read it in less than 24 hours. Many of the characters do horrible things to one another--I wanted to yell at them, especially when they were emotionally abusive to the children. Though it's frustrating to read a book about people like this, I see it as a sign of how skillfully Ansay writes--the characters seemed real. It is not a book that will please conservative Catholics or those who argue that feminism has hurt the family--Ansay clearly thinks that a big dose of feminism was needed to help fix the all-too-often-present pathologies of male-dominated traditional families. It made me happy, as a woman, to live now rather than the early 70s."
4,Dark but beautifully written,"This is a haunting, beautifully written book. Ansay did a wonderful job describing the small Wisonsin town where the story takes place. I found the main character, Ellen, a bit elusive and frustrating, but other than that I really liked this book. It is, however, somewhat dark so if you're looking for an uplifting read this would not be a good choice."
2,Oprah...you're getting lazy!,"After spending ten hours on a car trip reading this book, I realized I would have been more entertained by watching the cold gray scenery pass me by. Is Oprah really reading these books she is praising? I would like to know exactly what she found in this book to recommend. I can find boring, average books to read without Oprah's help, thank you!"
5,Moving and Unsettling,"Without a hint of melodrama, the secrets of a family ruled twice over -- externally by an abusive and hateful patriarch, and internally by an oppressive, formalistic, religious devotion -- are played out through the eyes of an outsider, the family's daughter-in-law, Ellen, compelled by her husband's job loss to move her family in with his parents. As we learn more of each family member's life story, we see that the only chance Ellen has to save her personal soul is to abandon her religious soul, as well as all of her female role models. Although I had absolutely nothing in common with the characters (the novel is set in a Catholic, German-American farming community in Wisconsin in 1972) I was unable to put this novel down. The prose is elegant, lean, and very special."
3,Decent read...,"No, this is not a fantastic journey into another time and state of mind, but it is well-written and sadly, believable. For the reviewers that claim the time/area isn't credible, I must disagree. Those that didn't deal with similar issues or circumstances should consider themselves lucky, indeed, but to discount the possibility that others might not have been so fortunate is ludicrous. Character development could have been stronger, and some passages were lacking in clarity, but overall, it's a decent book, quite worth a read!"
3,"Enjoyable, but not enthralling...","This is another story of a woman struggling to reclaim her life amidst the tangled mess of in-laws, husband and children, and family history. Thematically quite relevant and thought provoking, this book touches on one aspect of what seems to be a central theme in Oprah's book-picks -- that of women truly finding themselves amidst the mess of every day life.The circumstances are intriguing, the theme is timeless, but the characters were not as fully developed as I would have liked. Also, the story line always hints at truths and insights that are never convincingly revealed or illustrated.I enjoyed this book, but it wasn't enthralling. Easy to put down, easy to pick back up."
1,15 hours I'll never get back.,"I've agreed with most of Oprah's selections, but what on earth was she thinking when she promoted this one? It was boring, boring, boring! Who was I supposed to root for? I didn't like Ellen. I didn't like her husband. I didn't like his parents, her nosey sisters, their bratty children. Everyone was miserable, and kept throwing Catholicism out as the reason they couldn't move on."
2,TOO DEPRESSING !,"I read this book because I have enjoyed other Oprah selections, but I think this choice was certainly not the best one. I found the characters to be almost unbelievable and Ellen especially seemed too resigned to the hopelessness of the situation for such a long time. The fact that she finally pulled herself and her children out of this quagmire of doom did not make me like her very much. I can't believe that a woman would let this torment last so long especially for the children she loved. Better late than never? Not necesssarily-- Especially in terms of reading this book."
2,No story--no plot,"I was excited to read this book and it started out quite interesting, a family forced to move in with the father's parents. I thought the author would develop the characters more, but nothing happened, NOTHING. Several story lines seem to have started but nothing came of it, the history of the parents (German immigrants), the odd relationship with their only son, the heroine's resorting to medication to deal with her situation, etc. I do not recommend this book, its a waste of time, albeit it, it is an easy read."
2,Too depressing,"Ansay is a good writer but the story was too depressing. I was waiting for some bright spots but none appeared. Also, this story did not finish with much inspiration. After reading this book I had to buy the book ""Aunty Mame"" by Patrick Dennis to cheer me up. It's my third time reading Aunty Mame but I know I'll still get a good laugh!."
1,Vinegar Hill,"I have to say that this is one of the worst books I have ever read. I found the book to be disjointed, confusing, and extremely slow. There was not sufficient character development so I never got to the point of really empathizing or sympathizing with any of them. I really feel that the theme of the book had so much promise and was never explored thoroughly. A simple story with conversation would have been a more satisfying read than the way the author chose to tell the story. A definite thumbs down.!"
2,Bitter to the end,"What a boring, depressing novel!It's an easy read, but I personally didn't get anything from it. The story does have some interesting characters but not much happens to them. Most of the characters aren't really likeable either.I have read and enjoyed novels with sad subject matter, but this one is so bitter it grows tiresome. Stick to books like White Oleander, and She's Come Undone, those were better Oprah selections that are more interesting."
1,Vinegar Hill -- A Sour Place,"Vinegar Hill, highly touted and recommended by Oprah, is a disappointing book. The story is not one that takes us away from our own dysfunctional lives, but throws us into a seriously dysfunctional family who live on Vinegar Hill. The story is not enjoyable and I asked myself WHY did I waste my time reading such a story when I was through. I commend the author's talent at putting such a story together, but it certainly is not enjoyable reading. I will hesitate in the future over the decision to buy an ""Oprah's Book Club"" selection."
1,Something smells,"Oprah, Oprah.... How could you possibly. I mean I rarely follow her book ideas. This time I did and it will never happen again. THIS BOOK STINKS. It is depressing and damaging. It is gray in Michigan in the winter. This book has made it even darker. I didn't finish it. This seldom happens with me and a novel. YUCK. Do not waste your money, people."
2,Interesting but incomplete,"The premise of this book is great and easy to get into, however when you reach the end you're left with an unsatisfied feeling that nothing was really resolved. Lots of dysfunctional family problems/issues (some really horrifying), yet the book ends abruptly without addressing many of those issues. It's almost as though the writer got tired of the story and felt the need to wrap it up quickly."
1,Disappointment,"What a drag and a chore at that! I got little or no pleasure from reading this book and found a lot of the long paragraphs both boring and skip-worthy after awhile. I stuck with it hoping Elln would wake up. She turned out to be a limp dish rag with no sense of self and it was too late by the time she came to her senses. The other characters were totally pathetic; the husband, James was a total baffoon, the grandfather, an unloved, pathetic & bitter old man.The daughter was the only one with a glimmer of hope and backbone. Oprah needs to get a grip on her themes and intentions when choosing such books. A disappointment indeed."
3,A Decent Book--------,"This author has the potential of writing well & has previously. Perhaps it was simply the plot (or lack of) that just couldn't keep me captivated.She's good with her characters & you really ""see"" them, but this story just did not do much for me.I think it might be worth it to others to try though, as I definitely do not regret reading it & will read more of her."
1,This book doesn't deserve the time it takes to read it!,"I kept reading this book hoping it would get better. Unfortuntately, it never did. The story just seemed to go on and on without any real point or meaning. When I finished it, I was so frustrated that I had wasted my time reading such a terrible book."
2,blah,The best word I could come up with to describe this book is...blah.There are so many loose pieces that are never tied together. I would not recommend bothering with this book.
1,"Weak writing, weaker tale","I'm not sure how this book made it to Oprah's List, but having read only three on her list, this may be typical of what one will find there.I didn't like the story being told in the present tense but that could have been forgiven had there been a story worth telling.I could see Lifetime Movies for Women having a field day with this. Too sappy, too shallow, and a cast of undeveloped characters.On to Wally Lamb. Maybe I'll fare better there."
1,Not For Me,"This book was definately not my type. I was frequently disgusted and could not relate to any aspect of the main character. There was little hope to hold onto as I read about a family full of dark, terrifying secrets. There was no silver lining, nothing to keep me reading except the possibility of closure from the sickening story line. I don't doubt there are people like these characters out there, but I hope to never waste my time on the likes of them again."
3,Okay. Could have been better.,"I liked this book, although I think it could have been better. One thing that struck me was the pull of the Catholic Church in Ellen's life. Can those old teachings be so strong as to make someone question whether they should leave such an abusive environment? How could someone bring their children into such a life and think it would be morally wrong to take them away? I thought the story was good, but I think the theme of Ellen's journey into personal strength could have been better developed. After so many chapters of despair, her redemption at the end is a little too quick and rather anti-climatic. Also, Mary-Margaret's character had potential for her own emotional redemption, which never came to fruition."
2,A Tremendous Waste of Talent.,"This book is a fine example of beautifully written, highly descriptive prose. Unfortunately, it serves only to demonstrate the overall importance of story over style. One keeps waiting for the story line to pick up, and occasionally some vague hint promises that it might. It never does, then one begins to hope that the ending might justify all the labor invested in the bland reading. The end resolves nothing; it is neither unique nor even interesting, leaving the reader wondering how he or she got duped into staying with such a long, lifeless narrative."
2,Tedious,"Would have made a good short story, book was too long and tedious. Had to force my self to finish, not worth purchasing."
2,depressing family,"Talk about marrying not only your husband but also his family! And what a mean-spirited, depressing group! Poor woman but I felt most sorry for the kids. I was really glad to finish this book because even though the woman and kids seemed to escape this awful place I wanted to get out of there myself even sooner."
1,Are we there yet!,"Enough already! This book puzzled me from the beginning. I've made it a point not to judge a book immediately after completion, but rather to wait for that ""aftertaste"" that comes in the days after. If I find myself referring back to a book, whether it be positive or negative, then I feel it moved me in some way; which I think is what any writer's motives should be. The only time I thought about this book in the days after was when my cat knocked it off the counter and onto the floor and I had to go pick it up. Oprah usually recommends books worth reading. I'm sure the purpose for the recommendation of VINEGAR HILL was that she finally found her ""spirit"" at the end and gave herself some ""oxygen"" in order to give ""oxygen"" to the others in her life; but, PLLLEEAASSEE, we have to muddle through 240 depressing, suicidal, confusing pages to get to that lone paragraph on the final page to ""get it."" Take your Prozac before you read this one."
2,"Hard to finish, but I did it","This was a very difficult book for me to read. The only reason I read it was because my book club chose to read it. It was not normally a book that I would have picked to read. Having said that, I realize that I found the book to be confusing and hard to follow. Ellen seems to be the main character, and yet the author keeps switching the point of view from the husband to the mother-in-law to the daughter and even to the aunt, Salome. What the author didn't tell us and I was dying to know by the end was why the father-in-law was such a beast, and more importantly why everyone kept putting up with him. This story took place in the 1970's not the 1870's. The best part of the story was when Ellen turned the hose on her weak-minded husband. All I could think of was what took her so long?"
1,Vinegar (C)Hill,"The two best things about this book are the title and the fact that one doesn't have to invest much (financially or time-wise) in it. The characters are unbelievable because all of them (from youngest child to oldest grandmother) think in the same dark, depressing manner with religious undertones. The author's writing style leaves much to be desired. I found myself on almost every page trying to determine: (1) who was talking, (2) whether it was past or present, and (3) if it was a dream sequence. If this book was a real slice of life, I'd be looking for a new life, not the answer in a pill bottle. I found it to be a bitter, tedious read and, contrary to the New Yorker Review, the final line was not worth the pain it took to get there. At least, not worth MY pain!"
3,Hoped for more,"I found the back cover to be a bit misleading... while it was a good read, I kept waiting for a climax that didn't happen. The writing was extremely descriptive and I often felt myself right there in the house during many of the scenes, but once it was over I was left feeling unfulfilled."
3,The Way It Was,"Although this book was quite depressing, I found it to be true to life as I remember it back in 1972(the year that I graduated from high school). I think that we forget how trapped our mothers felt in their relationships. If they found they were in an abusive relationship, there was no support from the community or their families. Sometimes I found it very painful to read, but I congratulate the author on the ending. Ellen Grier did what my mother did not have the courage to do. I recommend that you read it with an open mind, keeping the time period in perspective. Sometimes the storyline became a little unbelievable, but still made for an interesting read."
3,"Sad, wistful book","This book had a lot of emotion in it. I could tell that Ellen, the protagonist, was suffering. That was made clear through her interactions with her husband and her in-laws. She was in a loveless marriage and it was easy to see her despair. So, on that front, I think the book was a success. I did, however, want more-- more depth, more action from Ellen, something more. If there was one thing this book did do for me, it was to show me that it's better to be on your own than to be with a man who just doesn't do it for you. And that's a worthwhile lesson."
5,My mothers favorite perfume,An all time favorite of my Mothers. This scent is soft and classy just like my mother. Well worth the price.
4,I'm unsure on this one,"I was one of the first people to buy the original volume 10. The only question is: ""Is it worth it to re-buy the set to see Joel and the old school players doing a new skit on the reason the old version was pulled?""Maybe. I like the choice of ""The Gila Monster"" replacing the ""Godzilla v. Megalon"" from the original disc set. The invention exchange on that episode is awesome (The Mads demonstrate ""Ren-Fest Punching Bags"").The other movies are worth well worth the purchase price.Looks like I'll be buying this again...and I don't hate myself for it."
5,Hoorah for volume 10.2!,"I can't wait for this to be released! Like most people, I can't shell out 200 dollars for the original.By the way, don't fret volume 10 owners. Supposedly, you will be able to get ""Giant Gila Monster"" as an individual DVD soon."
3,"admittedly, these are fun movies, but the price is too high","I love these kinds of film, and indeed I got most of them in various Mill Creek collections. While these may be better prints than mine, they are far more expensive. Moreover, how often will you want to watch them? I say go for the inferior quality as these are perhaps once in a decade watches when the time is right and for that, you do not need quality prints. You can get three Mill Creek colllections (about 150 films if not more) for the price of just these."
3,WHY ??????? 10.2 SHOULD BE A 3 FILM SET!,"This is unfair to the people who bought the first version of this set which was pulled from store shelves for copyright issues. Why didn't they release 10.2 with just the 3 remaining movies that didn't have copyright problems at a reduced price? To make fans who own the original set buy a set that is 75% rehash just to get the one new movie is shameful and ridiculous! I have heard rumors of a limited edition single disc release of the one new film and I hope this is the case or there is going to be H E L L to pay! I'm sure this will cause more problems when they sell out of it. WAIT! I'm seeing a vision..............I predict the next big selling second market item will be 'The Giant Gila Monster' limited edition single disc from Rhino! I love the show and I'm happy fans will be able to own most of the original set but, I can not condone this sort of thing!"
4,The Great Republic is great fun.,"The best part of the audio was the telling of The Revolutionary War from the losers without bitterness but with humor. The coming together of the United States & Britain was excellent. Great Britain, at the end of the 19th century was the greatest power on earth yet had no alliances with any major power. It really didn""t take long for the two most powerful English speaking nations in the world to warm to each other. It is an important subject that has not been covered entensively in American History books."
3,The reader is unbearable,"I couldn't bear to listen to this audio book for more than 15 minutes before I put it away for good. Winston Churchill's grandson appears to be unable to read complex sentences out loud. He ends sentences where commas occur, only to continue in suprise that there is more to read. His introduction is also incredibly pompus."
1,Churchill's grandson has a poor reading voice.,"It is Churchill's grandson, not Churchill himself reading this. Dreadful sing-song whiney voice. I couldn't get past the first side of tape 1 because of it."
5,Always great music,"This has always been a great album, haven't heard it for years and was happy to hear it again! Great quality, super fast ship, this is a great buy."
4,A Versatile Virtuoso,"Harry Belafonte's clear, penetrating voice and crisp, precise phrasing are instantly recognizable, and on this collection of his greatest hits we hear him at his finest, running through everything from mento and calypso standards (""Day O"", ""Hold 'em Joe"", ""Coconut Woman""), to spirituals (""Mary's Boy Child"", ""Michael Row the Boat Ashore"") to syrupy ballads (""Scarlet Ribbons"") to American folk and protest songs (""John Henry"", ""Abraham Martin And John""). This album is highly recommended for both the Belafonte faithful and those endeavoring to get a sense of his work for the first time."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"BUYER BEWARE!!! I never received half of my order, and my entire order were gifts for people, and the half that I did receive took over 2 weeks to arrive. I had to call the seller several times. The 1st time they said they were reshipping it, but again it never appeared. The 2nd time, I was asked to leave my phone # & then was never called back! I was finally sent an email stating a refund was to be given, but I was never called back & explained why. This has taken well over a month, which is totally ridiculous in my book!!! These people are awful!!!"
3,Kids Video,I bough these for a person with Alzheimer's - it was ok but the talking was too much and hard for them to follow. It really is a kids video!!
5,the page you shown music from benny more and i heard other m,hay un pequeno problema estan mostrando algo nuevo de benny more hecho por cubanos y la musica que sale es de religion. the page show a new production of benny more cuban singer by one all stars band but i heard a christian music.
4,Clash of Cavalry,"The Battle of Brandy Station was one of the significant cavalry battles of the Civil War. Downey's book is the major, if not the only, study. Though dated, it's still very useful.Downey intersperses general cavalry information, of great interest, with chapters on the battle. He doesn't make the tactical events of the battle itself very clear, but perhaps that's an impossible feat. Plenty of quotes and the lyrics to ""If You Want to Have a Good Time Jine the Cavalry"" keep the text vivid."
3,Sangean RS-330 digital radio,"Radio has very good sound. and tuning is easy. Can't believe time does not say am-pm on the clock face. Took trial and error to set the alarm as did not know if it was set for 8am or 8pm. Alarm is also very soft, need to set another alarm if I really need to get up.[ASIN:B000023VW1 Sangean RS-330 Digital AM/FM Clock Radio]]"
5,"Finally, a first rate clock radio","I purchased this item seven months ago and I remain convinced that this is probably the best item that I have ever purchased from Amazon (I'm a regular customer). It is accurate and reliable with excellent sound quality. I find the settings easy to use and the screen easy to read. After many years of searching, I have found a clock radio that provides me with both pleasure and dependability."
2,RS330 poor performer,"I like the sound of the radio and the FM reception is very good but that is all that I like about it. I have also found that my 330 hums, this is most annoying in a quiet bedroom. The super capacitor memory backup isn't super at all! Living in a rural setting where power outages are frequent has revealed a serious flaw in this radio, power failures of less than a minute cause the RS330 to forget all tuner presets and clock settings. When power returns the radio tunes itself to whatever station it feels like and comes on loud, not a pleasant experience in the middle of the night. This radio can not be depended upon for reliable alarms and is an annoying product to live with."
1,Display Doesn't Dim Sufficiently and it Hums!,"I'm dissapointed, this thing emits a low level 60HZ hum continuously. The display brightness is adjustable but at the lowest level its still bright enough to cast shadows and disturb sleep. The buttons are described as backlit but IMHO that is not true. The buttons have a band of clear plastic surounding them, what you see is a row of lighted rectangles and circles that are dark in the center with no way to identify their function. I think the correct description would be perimiter lighting which isnt very usefull and adds to the excessive night time light output. Just what I don't want in the bedroom, a brightly lit noisemaker! This one is being returned. Thumbs down, I dont recommend this radio."
2,Hums along,"The biggest objection I have to the RS-330 is that it hums continuously, whether the radio is turned on or off. Another reviewer suggested that placing the unit next to some other electronic device may cause the humming. Not true. Location of the unit has nothing to do with this noise, which is audible from across the room, if the room is quiet. I wanted to use the RS-330 in my bedroom, but I've found the humming so annoying that I'm either going to return the radio or banish it to another room.Otherwise, the RS-330 is okay. It has typical clock-radio features. Fidelity is adequate. The tuner pulls in local FM stations fine, but the more distant stations come in fuzzy, even with the supplied antenna attached. The thing I like the best about the radio is the presence of tone controls - one for treble, another for bass."
3,mediocre,"Despite the assurances of several reviewers, this radio hums. No other radio I've ever owned has hummed. I don't care whether or not it is near high tension wires or close to a nuclear sub. Whatever the excuse, it shouldn't hum. This annoying feature ruins an otherwise excellent product."
5,Great Radio,My old RS330 died when I knocked it on the floor for the hundreth time. I tried a couple of similar radios and was consistently disappointed. So I was relieved to see that they are still making this wonderful radio. It's ergonomics are perfect. You can tell that a tremendous amount of thought has gone in to its design. The RS330 also has very good reception and sound.
1,poor reception after a few years,"After only having this radio for a year, the reception became very poor and the sleeper button stopped working."
2,"Like the Grundig S350, NOT a DX machine !","Like the cheap piece of junk Grundig S350, receptioncapabilities are way over-blown, and like the S350, is wayover-priced..."
4,Exactly as described,"It arrived quickly, and had to be warmed up for easiest installation, as recommended. It takes a little elbow grease to get it on the steering wheel, but its no more difficult than any others I've done in the past. My wife is very happy with it."
4,"Great musical artist, among the few out there.","Little did I realize many of the songs that I heard on some of my favorite movies were the works of Bruce Hornsby and the Range. That's when I started purchasing his CDs. If it's any musician who deserves the royalities when a person buys their merchandise, it's Bruce Hornsby."
3,"Good, but not as good as any other Hornsby album.","I've always liked this album and it has a couple of my personal Hornsby favorites on it including ""Look Out Any Window"", ""The Valley Road"" (just a great song, period), and ""The Show Goes On"". However, the album has the distinction of containing the worst song that Bruce has ever done. ""Defenders of the Flag"" is just one bad song and it seems totally out of place with the others on this album. Not only does the song clunk along but Bruce lays on the social commentary in an overly heavy-handed way. He's apt to be somewhat political on all of his albums but it's done best when presented in a more subtle manner, not when the listener is beat over the head with it. While this is a good album, it's the least of Hornsby's catalog with all five of his other studio releases being superior to this one. That speaks of a great artist and Hornsby is definitely one."
5,Classic Hornsby!,"There is not a bad track on this disc.Very pop sounding, but what was ever wrong with that?Hornsby's best tune THE SHOW GOES ON resides on this disc, which I've never met a person in my life that didn't love it as much as I do!WOW!"
2,"Nice router, but electronic overload cutout is a pain!",The higher horsepower is definitely welcome in this body-grip router compared to the 1 3/4 hp Milwaukee routers that we've been using. But the electronic variable speed control has an overload cutout feature that is a royal pain. You can't load it much at all until it shuts down and must be restarted. It invalidates the extra power. Milwaukee says it's by design and normal. I'd stick with the 1 3/4 hp that actually stays running.
1,Man of The Year - John Ritter,I want to say first of all that I loved John Ritter. This is one of the worst movies I have ever watched. I wasted my money on this. It shows a party and a lot ofr his friends and enemies. It is almost all split screen. The idea is that there are security cameras all over the house and this is what you see from them. Sometimes there are four different screens at once. Everyone is talking and talking very loud. Everybody is hitting on every body. It was a waste of my money and time.
5,Great review book.,"The GED practice book does a nice job of presenting usage guidelines immediately followed by a self-test.The practice exercises/application quizzes not only are a great review for GED testing, but would also be applicable for end-of-level state exams."
3,Not made for 04 Civic,These are universal and can be cut to length but they were too wide to fit without being forced. They come up as fitting my 04 Honda Civic but they aren't really a good fit. The factory refills are much better.
3,For the price of some magazines this hardback book ain't bad,"This book contains a brief insight into each of the Ferrari road cars produced between 1948 (166)- 1995 (F50). Each car is limited to two pages of history, photographs, and technical data.The photograph quality is very good but not all that big in size. Technical info is minimal.If you already own a few good Ferrari books, then I doubt this book has anything to offer you that you don't already know. Otherwise, considering price and photograph quality it is still appealing.If you are just becoming interested in Ferrari road cars and want some basic info with pictures and not willing to spend alot of money, then this book is nice place to start."
4,Excellent Value,"Ferrari; The Legend is concerned only with Ferrari's road cars beginning with the 166 Inter and concluding with the F50. Each model receives two pages of beautiful photos and interesting commentary. The meanings of the numbers and letters in the name for each model, dates of production, and interesting facts are all included in the commentary. However, the photos alone (such as the two-page photo of the 512TR s/n 94516) are well worth the price of the book! Specifications, acceleration data and production figures are also given. Excellent value!"
3,Quite nice for a Ferrari fanatic.,"This book is real cool. All the pictures are amazing! The only problem is, it's not new and it doesn't have formula 1 cars. It only features cars from the beginning till the F50. It's real cool though."
3,A word of caution involving the shipper.,"The bench (I have seen it elsewhere on the web, and this price on amazon.com really is good) is shipped via Eagle services (www.eaglegl.com). They have been incredibly slow and seem to have their phones manned by 3 people who don't know to whom to pass tracking-related calls.If you can get it shipped via another method, call or email amazon.com and find out. They have a toll free number now available in the US.As of 8/8/05, I have noticed that the coating on the metal (it's more of a greenish color than what may be reflected online) is beginning to ""rust"" off/corrode off. This is my first outdoor bench, so I don't know if this is normal. It certainly does *not* look new, however.Oh, the bench is a nice, standard bench like the ones you see in Home Depot but this has the rooster and chicken on the back support slab. Very cute. 88 lbs."
4,Where are they now?,Loved the group when they first hit the scene! I wonder where are they now? Will there be a reunion of siblings?
3,Not quite what I expected,"Expected it to be more about the team, and not so much about the school philosophy. Team discussion was fine"
1,Where this book belongs...,"I bought this booking thinking it couldn't be that bad. It is on the NY Times best selling list. This was the worst book I have ever read. There was no plot, no story line. The author spent more energying describing every meal that was eaten than she spent developing a story. Even as a mindless airport book I do not recommend this book."
1,"Shallow, boring, not up to BTB standards","This book was so badly written and put together, that I'm glad it was a quick read. I'm an avid reader and have enjoyed, reading other BTB books. The only reason I kept reading, is to find out about the world famous painter and the relationship with the main character. What a joke!!! It seemed that the words ""war photojournalist"" were dropped into the text way, way too often -- as if the word processer was programmed to add those words whenever there was a mention of what the main characters did for a living and that the reader might just forget. It certainly didn't add anything especially since the descriptions of being ""under fire"" were really trite. Also the gratitous bedroom scenes were almost comical along with the continuous descriptions of meals, foods, clothes, etc. I certainly will think twice before picking up any other BTB books."
1,A Woman of Stubstance...not,"If it were not for her wonderful book, A Woman of Substance, I don't think any publisher would be interested in her writing. It has steadily declined. This book has unrelated subplots that are never resolved, very shallow characters that are so immature and basically stupid the reader cannot even become interested in their fate. Don't waste your money."
1,You're Kidding!!,"I read this book only because it was lent to me by an unfortunate person who was lumbered with it for Mothers Day. It was the only BTB book I've read since ""Woman of Substance"" and I fine it hard to believe that it was written by the same writer! The dialogue was unbelievably twee and some of it was out of a Victorian novel---the heroine calls her brother --Brother mine!!!!!Oh brother! I finished it because it was so bad that it was funny."
1,"poor writing style, shallow plot, simplistic characters","Many years ago as a young teenager, I picked up the author's ""A Woman of Substance"" and could not put it down. That was the first novel that ever gripped me. Now after reading ""Where You Belong"" I don't know whether the author has regressed dramatically or my taste at 14 left much to be desired. ""Where You Belong"" is written in annoyingly childish sentences. The characters are ridiculously one-dimensional - her mother was a rip-off of Cinderella's step-mom - and there is no attempt at setting the stage so that readers could draw their own conclusions. The fact that the book is written in the first person does not help - The heroine/narrator spends most of the novel either describing her heroic efforts or stating that her family hated her. There really was no plot to the book. The heroine never grew or developed inn any way over the course of the novel. In short - I want my money back on this one!"
1,Horrible,"I snapped up the latest book and even though the inside jacket summary didn't thrill me, Barbara Taylor Bradford did write the fabulous Women of Substance so any of her books should be good - right? WRONG! I started this and after reading the first 71 pages I HAD to go on line to Amazon reader reviews to see if this book was as bad as I thought it was! The writing is disjointed, trivial and after skimming through the remaining pages, nothing I am going to waste my time finishing."
1,Good Grief!,"As I was listening to this book in my car on CD (rented from the library thank goodness!), I was thinking, ""do people actually think this is good writing? I could write a book a lot better than this!"" I was so relieved to see the rest of these reviews. I won't have to bother going on to Disc 3. Thanks!"
2,"Say it ain't so, Barbara Taylor Bradford","So sorry that the author who gave us Emma Harte and family presented so uninteresting and shallow characters in her eagerly awaited new novel. I found myself asking ""why am I bothering?"" There was no point where I really cared what happened next- which to me should not be something to think about when reading such an established writer. Disappointed at best,questionable at least. Whatever happened?"
1,High Anticipation - Severe Disappointment,"After every book BTB writes, I think to myself ""I have to wait a whole year for another chance to see if she writes any better"" Well I'm not waiting any longer, and I'm certinly not spending my hard earned money that I purposly save to enjoy BTB's latest work. My family and friends all know what a huge fan I am (was), and would fight over who would by me the latest copy. They no longer will have that opputunity."
1,Incomplete.,"I enjoyed the beginning of the book. The heroine, Val, in Kosovo, finding out her lover was married and finding a new relationship with Jake. THEN it just kind of fell apart. I didn't enjoy the shallow relationship with her brother (they don't speak for years and then he finds out she will give him the company and he LOVES her), the Angelique character, who SHOULD inherit Lowell's, but no one even thinks of trying to find, the brief flirtation with the artist (why? ), the goofy mother who is just left hanging, and her return to Kosovo, where she swore she did not want to go, to be with Jake. I thought there must be another cassette that was missing."
1,so bad it was good!,"this book was so bad it was fun to read just to marvel at 1. the unbelievable plot; 2.the number of times the heroine mentions how bad her childhood was; 3. the incredibly bad soap-opera dialog between the mother & daughter; 4. the thousands of times the author tells us that her heroine was A WAR PHOTOGRAPHER! 5. the plot lines that go nowhere & are not resolved; 6. how this book ever got published.this was the 1st book I've read of this author; I understand she has written better books, but I think plowing thru this one was enough for me."
1,Very Disappointed,"I have read all of BTB's books. I was very, very disappointed in this book. As with so many other devoted BTB fans, I felt that I should finish the book. I kept thinking it would get better. It never did. Thank goodness I did not buy this book."
5,This review refers to the audiobook,"I was a bit hesitant to listen to this book after reading so many negative reviews here. Maybe it translates differently on audio than it did to the reviewers who read it on paper because I thought it was a wonderful and heartwarming story about two very likable journalists who find love and healing in the face of war's tragedies. Secondary characters added further depth and interest, as do the detailed settings and the journalist's eyewitness descriptions of the more personal side of war. Highly recommended."
1,Can I rate it lower than 1 star?,"I always finish books that I start but it was never so painful as it was this time! Val is such a whiner about her treatment by her mother, I had no interest in how she washes every leaf of lettuce and her turnaround relationship with her brother was ludicrous! This book was absolutely unbelievable and a waste of time."
1,save your money,The book is predictable and very boring. Barbara Taylor Bradford used to write good books but with this one she truly failed!
1,Worst Book Read in Loooong Time,"Even now I ask myself, why did I bother to finish it? I guess because it showed promise a few times, but nothing ever developed. It starts with a bang, but descends into histrionics quickly. Transitions are bad, food descriptions are waaay overdone, the final section seems to have appeared from nowhere and the heroine overreacted so often I found myself actually laughing. Does anyone edit books anymore? I am definitely not interested in ever reading anything ELSE by this author."
1,Mindless Drivel,"I had to literally FORCE myself to finish this book, hoping for something to happen. No such luck. The set-up is of a very successful, independant woman who discovers she is (surprise!) not complete without a man. This book had the potential to bolster women's independance, but failed miserably. It was a terrible ordeal to read, very predictable and the ending was pure relief for the reader."
1,What happened?,"How did this book ever get published? I am so disappointed. I have read many of Barbara Taylor Bradford's books, but this one is a total waste of time. The book seems very disjointed and the characters have no personality and definitely no ""substance."" It is rare for me to not finish a book, but this one I cannot force myself to complete."
1,Disappointing,"I have read many, not all, BTB books, and I must agree this was disappointing. If the whole battered French woman story had been dropped, maybe the main story could have been more complete and developed.I was somewhat interested and kept reading, but the book went no where, and everything sure wrapped up very tidily at the end. Too many extraneous story lines. Skip it!"
3,Bristol Valley Sheer Rim,"The product name overstates the actual product - ""sheer rim"" - but overall the glasses are fine for the price. It was a convenient way to order this number of glasses, but the same quality can be found in sets of four at Wal-Mart."
3,+ 1/2* Very good cast,"Mono but well balanced recording, the voices come through quite clear. Of great historical interest and very pleasant to listen to. Tagliavini does an adequate job although this is clearly not his best performance but Rosanna Carteri is superb as Mimi. Siepi and Taddei are excellent with a fine contribution from Elvina Ramella. If it wasn't for the mono sound and unusually weak performance from Tagliavini it would be five star rating. Yet, this is a much more desirable performance to have of this opera than various stereo recordings of it. Best option is the classic recording with Jussi Bjorling et al on EMI."
5,just as the desert missed the rain...,"I would like to shout from the mountaintops all about the true genius and convenience of the twizzler pull n peel. I thought liquorice was the most perfect of foods, the way the red goes into your mouth and tastes like delicious cherry or strawbrerries. But then life had to go and give me this wonderful gift -- a liquorice that pulls just as it peels. All I have to do is tug on one of the delicate red strands and it glides off and goes into my mouth after I put it there. I can't wait, just thinkin about it!"
2,disappointing,"Much too soft and almost gooey when you try to chew it, without that 'bounce' that you expect from licorice-type products. Taste is really off. Doesn't taste like cherry- doesn't really taste like much of anything except for a weird almost spiciness. I actually thought mine was a stale package because the flavour was so bland and strange! Doesn't peel well; breaks when you try to peel it. I won't be buying this again; I'm going back to shoelace candy!"
2,nope. don't think so,"For what it's worth, I have over 20 years dance experience, as a professional dancer and teacher in both modern and belly dance. I'm usually not one to submit a review that's so out of sync with the majority, but I have to wonder if I was watching the same video as the rest of you!I found this choreography fussy and complicated but by no means advanced. I was very disappointed, especially for the price.I got more good material from Jillina in less time and for far less money.I was also unimpressed with Rania as a dancer. She seemed stiff and self-conscious. She did not fully finish her movements, nor did she have grace and flow.For a truly advanced drum solo get jamila al waheed or suzanna delvecchio!"
5,"Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.","When I first watched this video, I said to myself, ""How the heck am I going to do this?"" I think I actually fell over the first time I tried it. By the second time, I was cruisin' along just fine with the choreography.Some of it was easy, some of it was difficult. Some of it was intricate, and some of it was straightforward. The choreography has a nice flow.I found that working through this video improved my ability to count. I used to be lazy and not count, but with Rania's instruction, I learned to stay on top of the choreography.I am an advanced student and was always attracted to the Modern Lebanese/Amany style. I am very happy with this video and look forward to more choreography from Rania.As is expected from Rania, the bonus performance at the end is gorgeous. I actually learned a lot of new moves just watching the performance."
5,Chicken Sunday,"After reading Chicken Sunday I thought back and one reason I like this book is because it's really interesting . I like how the kids{ (Stewart ,Winston and the lil girl) tell the truth. Patricia Polacco is trying to show you good ways not to run when you do something wrong and to tell the truth when something bad happens. I really enjoyed reading this book."
5,Ideal for Character Education,"Although they are innocent, some young children make ammends for the harm done to a Holocaust survivor (the old man has the unmistakable tatoo on his forearm). You must purchase the Scholastic book on cassette for an even more motivating storytime (complete with music)."
5,really touching book,My second grader's teacher reach this book to the class. My daughter really liked it and asked me to get it. We just read it. WOW. What a a terrific book. It is very touching and works on many levels. I will certainly explore additional books by this author.
1,Never showed up,"Unfortunately I do not have anything good to say about this product because not only did it never show up, but I was also never warned it wouldn't. I have been waiting for over a month and no explanation was ever given to me. Hopefully this isn't how most of the products are handled."
5,Polacco at her very best,"Poignancy, humour, and detail are hallmarks of Polacco's books...and Chicken Sunday shines in all of these. Our girls (5 & 7)loved it so much that they asked for it to be read again as soon as we got to the end. All the telling things of a child's world, including being unfairly accused, secret hidey holes, and longing to show an adult how much they love them, are there. In addition there is a wonderful richness to the language, with images such as ""a voice like deep thunder and slow rain""."
1,Not worth the price,"This statue was a disappointment for the price paid. It was cheap looking and not at all what was expected. Compared to other Bowen Design pieces already owned, this was not worth the money. It was very expensive and should have been returned but it was a gift."
5,Never Beyond Hope,"The reading I have done in this book leads me to believe it is a very helpful, interesting book; the only criticism I have is that it was mailed to me without a dust cover."
2,More for 3 and under,"Bought for my 2, 4 and 5 year olds. I thought it was a cute video, but the 4 and 5 year old had no interest. They said it was boring and refused to watch it after about 5 minutes. The 2 year old might have watched it if it were not for the influence of her older siblings. I would not recommend for children over 3. I feel like it was a waste of money."
2,Good but tiring at times,"We got 3 of these DVDs, Maria - the host, will get on your nerves as she is trying to hard to be ""warm and fun"" - it's also very slow. This is a good option for a non bilingual home that is looking to learn Spanish. Too annoying for any native Spanish Speaking home....as it's slow and forced at times. The only good thing is the singer and the songs they feature."
4,Nice DVD,My 3 years old daughter is very much attracted to this DVD.She likes to dance in front of TV along with the songs played.I think this is a good DVD to get started in learing Spanish.
3,"Eh....it's OK, I guess","After reading so many of the positive reviews, I was very excited to receive this item. As someone who has extensively studied second language acquisition, I firmly believe that total immersion is the best way for a child to learn a second language. That is the main reason why I bought this video. However, the video itself was way too short (for the price). The video host was pleasant, at first, but then she started to annoy me, as her smile seemed to be permanently plastered on. As for her ""accent"", it's extremely close to being that of a native speaker, but true native speakers will be able to hear a very slight difference. Her accent isn't bad enough to teach incorrect pronunciation, so no worries there (not like those HORRENDOUS ""Kids Love Spanish"" videos).Bottom line:Will kids learn some Spanish words with this video? Yes.Will it keep their attention? Sometimes.Is it worth the price? No.Would I buy it again or recommend it? No."
3,OK - Not very impressed,"I was so excited to see all the positive reviews on this product, but once I saw the video I was dissapointed. The effort is OK. Overall not very exciting for my 2 year old - she looks like she is falling asleep while watching it. The songs are very plain and boring to me. I recommend Susy Dorn's series instead."
2,Just OK...,"I was excited to view this DVD based on the reviews, but it did not quite live up to expectations. I saw it together with my 4-year old and it did not hold his attention. The format consists of a narrator/teacher who speaks entirely in Spanish. She uses hand gestures and puppets to illustrate the Spanish words. This becomes somewhat repetitive after a while. The narrator was remarkably unremarkable, which may be good in that she doesn't detract from the lessons. Now for the not-so-good. Every so often a song pops up. Unfortunately the songs did not add to the video as they were reminiscent of old cowboy tunes. The accompanying ""booklet"" was a single fold-out with the words and phrases taught in the DVD. It would have been more useful if it were better structured with some explanation. Finally, I was surprised that the DVD only ran 20 - 21 minutes as I had expected more for the price."
4,Extreme Immersion,"I chose this Whistlefritz video because it was priced less than the Little Pim series. I have a 4-year-old daughter who watches Dora the Explorer and talks in her own spanish made-up language, so I wanted to try this out first.Talk about language immersion! Whistlefritz is completely in Spanish, with no english subtitles or spoken words at all. This is great. Kids learn through complete immersion. My 4-year-old and 2-year-old girls are totally captivated by this video and have started saying a few words in spanish. Yay!"
1,Not what I expected,"I recently purchased this CD for my 5 year old daughter. I am not very happy with this purchase. There is no english,spanish translation and the children are at least 7-8 years old not the ages I was expecting for a beginners program. Ithought this would be fun for my daughter but she has no clue what they are even asking her so she can;t participate in the games or singing and dancing:( This CD i good if you already have the basic idea down of spnish but NOT FOR BEGINNERS!!"
2,"Eh, it's okay","It took me a long time after getting ""Wish her safe at home"" to actually read it. Unfortunately, it wasn't really worth the wait. The premise seems promising and a good idea- Rachel Waring is a middle-aged woman (a spinster if people still used the word) who lives with a roommate that is not very likeable. So when a great-aunt dies and leaves her a mansion, Rachel leaves her old and boring life behind. For a time, all seems to be well. But as time goes on,Rachel changes and starts to descend into madness and the reader follows that journey with her.So though it seems like a really good book, I just wasn't thrilled by it. In fact, I found myself getting bored by it. After I started the book, it took me a long time to finish it. And that's pretty rare because I rarely take a week to finish a book and this took me over a week to finish. It's not a book that I'll feel the need to re-read down the road."
4,Interesting Monologue-A Danger to Herself,"In the beginning of this book, I liked Rachel, the main character, and thought she was a normal girl from London who inherited a house from her aunt. Slowly I started to get insights into issues that occurred in her childhood that were never dealt with; the death of her father and mainly her relationship (or lack of one) with her mother.Though at times it was disturbing to watch Rachel unravel and fall further down the rabbit hole, I found it hard to put the book down. It is an entertaining read, though sometimes hard to decipher when Rachel is talking to herself or with other people. There are a few disturbing scenes and some of the language is very graphic and does not fit in with the rest of the novel. The author must have felt that it was necessary to use certain vocabulary to convince us that Rachel was going over the edge and not Safe at Home.Overall, I would recommend this book."
3,Keep Her Safe at Home,"I acquired this book at a Watestone's in Islington, where the author was promoting the book. He signed my copied, and asked that I review the book on Amazon. Two and a half years later I finally got a around to reading it haha. I liked the book. I particularly enjoyed Rachael as a character, and learning about her life and misadventures in dating as a young woman which resulted in her current state. I must say I was quite disappointed in the ending, perhpas because I liked Rachael so much. I suggest reading it yourself, and coming to your own conclusion about the ending."
4,Pretty upsetting,"I really liked this book through the first half. Rachel seemed to have everything that anyone would want because of an inheritance - a beautiful house, enough money so that she didn't have to work, a few friends and some hobbies she was interested in. It sounded perfect, really. Her personality seemed a little eccentric, but nothing that would make you think too much of it. Then, all of a sudden in the middle of the book, I realized she was really mentally ill. I can't really tell if she was always that bad or if the lack of structure in her life drove her off the deep edge. I honestly did not enjoy the second half of the book, but I'm giving it 4 stars because I think that someone who is interested in mental illness might really like reading this book and trying to figure out just what went wrong with her."
4,Wrong info sheet,"We received the watch in a ""timely"" manner & it looked really good. However, the information sheet that was included stated that we could actually shorten the band length ourselves. After trying time & time again, we just gave up & took the watch & info sheet to our jeweler. He told us that the sheet was for another watch, so we could have worked on it until the cows came home & we would never have been able to shorten it.Since we had the links removed, my husband has enjoyed wearing it & it looks really good on him."
1,Don't believe their shipping estimates!,I placed an order on Nov. 16th for this item and here it is Dec. 29th and they have yet to ship the item. At the time I placed the order the estimate was that it would ship in 1-2 weeks and arrive between Dec. 2nd and Dec. 8th. The fools even charged my credit card over a month ago. I finally gave up and cancelled my order (though it took me TWO attempts to get this done as they completely ignored my first email). Heck of a way to run a business.
3,Uneven offering from Mayall,"Overall, this is not a bad set, but it suffers primarily from its live half (disc 2). While there are moments of interest in the live recordings, they are for the most part boring. The studio disc is what makes this collection worthwhile. Mayall once again rounded up some top notch musicians; among them, Freddie Robinson and Sugarcane Harris. They shine on this. My favorite track by far is ""Good Looking Stranger"" which the liner notes explains was the result of a drunk Mayall. This ""drunken"" take was so enjoyable that the ""proper"" vocal take never saw the light of day (as indicated by Mayall himself in the liner notes). If you're a Mayall completist like me then you'll want this. Otherwise, if you're just a causal Mayall fan, go with one of the many compilations out there."
5,One of the greatest,"One of the greatest white blues guys ever. John Mayall and Johnny Winter: better than any one else. Enjoy the violin of Don Sugarcane Harris on this album: wonderful stuff, one of the best things I've ever heard in the blues. Great sound. I am not so fond of electric or white blues, prefer the accoustic black stuff, but I adore John and Johnny. A must have."
1,"Vinyl, very heavy!","For some reason, this shower curtain comes up in the search results when you search for ""fabric shower curtain"". It's VINYL, not fabric. It is very heavy, which might be good for some people. But, not for someone like me that wanted a fabric shower curtain."
1,Big Disappointment! Album title very misleading.,"As a teenager growing up in South Florida in the mid 50's I used to listen to music on Cuban radio stations. It was very rhythmic and upbeat or romantic, languid and sensual. I bought this album because I heard the artist interviewed on Performance Today and loved what he played. But that piece and 2 others by the same composer are the ONLY compositions I like on this CD. The rest is not music but guitar ""sounds"" which could have come from a 20th century composer anywhere in the world. I do not like atonal music or that which does not have a melodic line SOMEWHERE in it. So that leaves me with 5 minutes of playable music out of 65 minutes. I forced myself to listen to the entire CD but doubt I will ever play it again. It certainly did NOT bring back memories."
3,Pleasant ambient listening,"None of the music here seems to come out of Cuba as a necessity, if you catch my meaning. Any Latin American composer could have turned out most of what is on this disc. On the other hand, the fact that all the composers are Cuban is reason enough, I suppose, to justify the title of this CD. Yet all this is beside the point. It is the music that should concern us. While none of it is strikingly original or even tuneful, there are moments of beauty, now brooding, now not quite as melancholy. But I cannot see myself wanting to give any of it close second hearings; although I will play it as ambient music and as a contrast to the more ""popular"" Giuliani, De Falla, Sor, et alia that usually are represented on collections such as this."
5,Fresh!,"Classic Fresh Prince.... Grew up with this album. Good wholesome clean rap. If you're this far, you probably know the music. I'd buy it in a heartbeat for a gift."
3,The Tape!,"This album is clearly my favorite of all of their albums. But did I miss something because when I bought the tape when I was younger, Nightmare On My Street & Human Video Game were longer and nothing was cut out. If someone has this on cd uncut and brand new for a reasonable price let me know.Thank you!"
2,Too d*mn pissed (what am I what am I),"Would they repackage Led Zeppelin 4 without Stairway to Heaven? This pale imitation of the REAL ""He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper"" omits the best track on the album, ""Another Special Announcement."" Couldn't they have cut off one of Jeff's 10 minute ego-trip megamixes to make room? Sorry, but you can't beat Freddy Krueger saying ""I'm too damn hyped"" over and over. Also, Nightmare on my Street is edited, and Human Video Game omits the entire ""Pac-Man"" beatbox section. Stick with the record or cassette version of this masterpiece."
4,Brand New Funk & Charlie Mack are 4.5 star songs!,The clip used here doesn't do CHARLIE MACK justice. It doesn't include the chorus. Only a slightly better choice of a clip was done on BRAND NEW FUNK. Both of these songs are AWESOME! I have this album on vinyl and those 2 can rock my house when the bass is jacked! I give this album at least 3.5 stars and those 2 songs 4.5 stars.
2,"All the homeboys that got AIDS, be quiet!","This album features DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince's first two hit novelty rap songs, ""Nightmare on My Street"" and ""Parents Just Don't Understand"". Those are the best songs on the album. The rest of the album isn't all that great. The problem is that at 72 minutes, this CD is way too long. There is a lot of ""filler"" on here. The album would be better if it was about 30 minutes shorter."
5,The Panama Route 1848-1869,"This book has answered alot of my questions in my Genealogy! ""The Panama Route"" Is a great book it kept me up until I finished it!"
5,Work like a clock!,Easy to install and it works as it should. Just be careful to install it out enough so that the metal plate can push the magnet cylinder out.
4,Book Group choice,Delightful book to curl up with on a cold day in January. The characters were very believable. I enjoyed the easy flow of he story. The main character drew you in with his quiet observations of life in the Valley of Light.
4,Window to another time....,"This is an excellent book if you want to know what it was like to fall in love in another time. Duras writing enables you to feel like you are walking the same streets and riding on the ferry with her characters. Yes this was the book that was used for the permise of the movie ""The Lover,"" but the book is so much better then the movie. It is said that this story is based in part on the authors personal experiences, which makes it even more romantic. The view you see of the past is one of great difference then what we know today. I plan to read other selections by Duras. I am glad I read the book, although the movie is good."
5,Milwaukee 5616-20 2-1/4 hp EVS bodygrip router,"This is a excellent tool. Right out of the box it has the feel of a quality piece of equipment. The ""easy start"" is a great feature that allows you to not get the ""Whiplash-torque"" if you are using the router as a had held tool. The router has great power and it works well in a router table-I'm using it in a ""Bench Dog Pro Top"" router table and it works fine. You may want a remote switch if you are using it in a table, if you are turning it on and off a lot. It handles large 1/2"" bits with not trouble."
3,"Where am I, now?","Mildly comical look at an unfortunate man's mistimed suicide attempt, his regenereation and subsequent hodge-podge of adventures, most too fantastical to believe. The author's many tangents when introducing new characters as they appear, in the form of childhood histories that only can be known from the narrative due to 'supernatural powers', makes for a slightly choppy and, at times, monotonous read. Abrupt ending."
5,The Pioneer for the Essential Elvis series,"Volume one of the 6 Essential Elvis releases is truly a great work by the folks at RCA.These unearthed gems really get you on the front row of Elvis' historic recording sessions for his first three films.The Jailhouse Rock numbers are awesome.I wish they would do a volume 7...I had always wondered what was the first volume like...I own it and now I know...it demonstrates why anything Elvis recorded is ESSENTIAL.Elvis and his endless work of beautiful,awesome music will stand atop,alone,forever."
3,wheeze,"allow me to add my bit to the proponderance of opinion that thinks this is rather a wheezy end to a series that started with such...i can't think of a better word than gusto. of course those of us who have read the whole series must read it, and of course only those who've read the whole series are going to read it, so in the end, all of our carping aside, by all means read it; those of us who haven't raved are simply disappointed. the niccolo of the early books i wanted to be; the niccolo of the middle books i wanted to follow; the niccolo of 'gemini', like a boozy, once-interesting guest at a dinner party, i wished would just get to the point. (incidentally, i would have to agree that henry was positively fascinating, a worthy son to his early-books father)"
2,Disappointed,"Sorry Dorothy, but I was disappointed by the end to a brilliant series. The first 3 volumes of this Niccolo series were in my opinion blisteringly good. However after this the storyline became increasingly weak and muddled. Gemini was the worst of all. Lots of boring detail about the Scottish monarchy and very little about Nicholas and his relationships with his family and company. The ends of David Salmeton,and Simon and Henry were unbelievably underplayed leaving a huge sense of anticlimax."
2,Stop at number 4 -- Scales of Gold,"I read the first book in the Niccolo series before I read the Lymond series or King Hereafter. After reading that book, I couldn't get enough of Dunnett. I've read everything she wrote, which took some doing, because many of the books were not readily available.That said, I can't recommend Gemini. For the first four books, I thought the Niccolo series was the best historical fiction ever written. But the series begins to deteriorate with number 5, although there are still some good moments. Unfortunately by number 8, the story is just plain boring. Read about your own father -- he's probably more interesting.I recommend that anyone not already in love with Dunnett's writing, just stop after the fourth book (Scales of Gold). And even if you ARE in love with Dunnett, I would give Gemini a miss. It's just too disappointing."
4,"Faster, Sheep-lover! Laugh! Laugh!","Knight's second ""K Chronicles"" collection is as zany as his first. From birthdays to family relations to touring with his band the Marginal Prophets to being subjected to ""The Phantom Menace"" movie, his cartoons's themes are full of social commentary, neurotic humor, and skewed realism. I think his ones about working at youth hostels and seeing the cultural-centrism of America at work are so perfectly calibrated. He's definitely worth reading, and I certainly wish his comic appeared in my area!Oh, and his comics inspire me daily to stare at the walls and envision drawings of snowstorms (like page 103)."
1,Package seal was broken and candy was missing,"I paid $12.99 for the supposedly last one and then they posted the price as $8.39. When I received this product, the safety seal was broken and 7 pieces were unaccounted for. Nothing like getting ripped off."
2,Watch who you order from,"My bad. I thought I'd be getting for nine dollars and change. Next thing I know I'm paying more than six dollars for S & H. Ridiculous...for candy. It ain't that good. If it had a more reasonable S & H, then I'd give it more stars."
1,wonka laffy taffy never came to my house and i got ripped off,the item never showed up at mu house and i have been waiting for a long time. I think the people stole my money and now i am short like 23 dollars. why did it not come please sen it to me thanks asap
3,opened,"hhhmmmm.....really strange but , just as another reviewer stated, the seal was broken the lid was off and candy was all over the box, and it could not have happened in transit...someone at the warehouse is doing this methinks"
3,No Grape =(,"Well...it's laffy taffy, so it's delicious. But, I was definitely disappointed that Grape wasn't one of the flavors in this tub. Banana, Strawberry, Cherry, Sour Apple....sure do miss the grape =("
3,NO GRAPE!,"I ordered this because the photo shows grape. Grape is my daughter's favorite, but I bought the mixed so she could share with college friends. Highly disappointed! The taffy itself she said is fine. I see the container only says the four flavors but if you look close you can see grape in there. My bad because I didn't read the description!"
5,"Big tub of Laffy Taffy.....,",Product performed well if intent was to add 5 pounds of lard to my girl friends rear end. What else can you say about a tub of candy....
1,Incomplete--Actual Dictionary Missing,"This book doesn't seem to contain the actual Dictionary, but only notes about and addenda to the Dictionary, which makes it pretty useless. I checked it on both the iPod Touch and Mac versions of the Kindle software (my actual Kindle hasn't arrived yet)."
2,Great product but is poorly identified,"The description clearly claims this product fits a Honeywell F50F and F300 electronic air cleaners.Honeywell makes two different sizes and the packaging on both are identical, ""fits F50F and F300"".I did not know this when I ordered and received the wrong size. A 16X 25 is part number 50000293-002 and 12.5 X20 is part number 50000293-004. The seller does not make this distinction for ordering - just it fits Honeywell F50F and F300. I asked for a return authorization and was given authorization - the problem is I paid shipping both ways for a lack of description on the item."
4,Cuts the dust,I added this to our existing electronic filter installation. It does appear to cut the dust in the house. Remains to be seen whether it can be vacuumed in six months to extend its life or must be replaced then.
5,please release an updated edition,"Great book! I found out about it when it was mentioned in another great book, The Well Dressed Ape, by Hannah Holmes. But at over 10 years old, I wonder how much ""old"" information it has. Please update this wonderful book."
5,Thanks for making this available,Read This. This is short and wonderfully sweet. The reader gets a real sense of Benjamin Banneker and his beautiful mind.There is a letter from Benjamin Banneker to Thomas Jefferson (then Secretary of State) and a response from Jefferson to Banneker. Poignant remarks from each man.
2,Rather Disappointing,"Although I am possibly the greatest fan ever of Disney Children's Favorite Songs (see my reviews for Vol. 1-4), this CD disappointed me. I confess I expected Disney Family Christmas to exhibit the same sterling qualities that were so evident in the four volumes of Disney Children's Favorite Songs; however, in my opinion, it was sadly lacking. The songs are all Christmas classics, and Larry Groce and the Disney Children's Choir also perform this collection. It doesn't have the same high quality of original interpretation that was so appealing in the Disney Children's Favorite Songs collection, and I could not in good conscience give this album the same great reviews I gave the other four. It's Larry Groce, but I don't think he was given carte blanche to create the masterpiece he was capable of. The CD is OK, but I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it. Such a shame, in view of his other work on his other Disney albums. Altogether, it was rather disappointing."
4,Childhood Memories of Christmas,"I bought this album as a present for my wife, who lost her copy several years ago and was disappointed because she could not play it for our children. It is a wonderful album. Both of us remember listening to it over and over again when we were young. This really made the season for her, as she nearly wore out this copy before Christmas day.The only downside is that this copy seems to have some volume difference between tracks. Those with the Disney characters are very loud, while the others are quiet. Neither of us recall this issue on our original album, so it may be a default with this copy.I would highly recommend for those who want a Christmas album for the whole family."
5,Kim Kardashian exercise tape very good,"Exercise video is challenging at first, but very good, just take your time and watch it a couple times before actually exercising to it. Product came in good condition and came pretty fast."
5,Workout,"I did not take this DVD seriously when I brought it, just thought is was going to be Kim looking cute making you envy her.... Was I wrong. This (the entire series) was a great set of workouts. I found I needed heavier weights but it is great for people just starting to work out or for people who are just trying to maintain, Even good for teens who need to get started working out. Very instrucational also. The entire series is worth a buy"
5,Ah-Mazing!,"This DVD is honestly amazing! I get such a good workout each time I do this DVD. At the end of the week, I could see and feel the results. I definately recommend this DVD to everyone! :-) Have fun and buy it!"
4,Real Curves,My 16 yo daughter and I love this workout. We appreciate that Kim has curves and reinforces that you don't have to be super skinny to be beautiful. She keeps us motivated throughout the workout.
3,its ok.,I think kim was more featured in her video then a star. It wasn't very motivated to see someone working out with a face full of make-up. Her trainer was great and actually looked like she was working out. Kim might just be a real girly that doesn't like the hustle. But I guess she tried her best.
3,Don't purchase unless you have a step!,"I purchased this dvd knowing that I needed a step to push the moves to an ""advanced"" level. Well, I got a stairmaster from a resale shop for 3 bucks and began the workout. After the warmout and workout 2, I still was not tired and wanted more! Workout two was not as difficult as I thought it would be. If you have ever taken a step class before, most of the moves performed were quite basic. This dvd is definately not for intermediate and above. This is a great dvd for beginners that want a fu, upbeat workout only!!!!"
3,okay workout,"If you are really trying to fit in your jeans by Friday I wouldn't exactly call this a hefty fine workout... I think it is more relaxed and calm. It's kind of funny because you can tell Kim K has no clue what she is doing and she does it in a Bra. I'm a women and I know I don't care to see her working out in her bra. My boobs aren't the problem so I don't need any motivation there. So if you are a guy I HIGHLY recommend for you, you'll love it! Ladies, its not my favorite."
1,Good for beginners only,I wanted to like this series of workout dvds because of Kim K. but they were not challenging enough. I expected more of a burn but ended up pretty disappointed.
4,"Fun Workout, NIce Change",It help to have the personal trainer on hand during this workout. It is a little challenging for beginner to immediate. I thought it was fun and nice to have a change from intense workout. I did not know who Kim Kardashian was but the workout is great. If you want a change get all 3 of the dvds.
3,ok--but kind of boring,"This video is quite effective, though kind of boring. It is nothing more than a lot of squats and lunges while sometimes using a step. If you prefer doing your lower body exercises to a fitness dvd (as I do) as opposed to counting reps on your own, this video might be for you, but I'm sure there are more fun ones out thereI am also not a fan of the trainer, Jennifer. I'm sure she is great in her own videos, but with Kim she seemed kind of shotty. Kim would try to make comments about making sure to breathe and remember to hold in your stomach, etc. and I felt like Jennifer was less than friendly in her response. I bought this video because I wanted to work out with Kim and not Jennifer with Kim doing the moves to the side."
2,Very Hard!!!,Got this dvd and its hard to follow along with they do the excercises too fast. You kind of have to watch it for a while the same sections to get a hang of it.
1,Not for me.,I love Kim as much as the next Kardashian lover but I do not love her dvd. It had a few good moves in it but it was way to fast paced. I was always at least one step behind and didn't feel like I could really get into a move before needing to be in the next one.I suppose it could be used as a reference. You also really can't do it without a step. Which is an expensive buy for a work out video.sorry Kim but your enthusiasm can't get you out of this one.
4,Lived Up To My Expectation,"I must say I was really impressed with the first cut. I was surprised how quite and smooth the cuts were and, as specified by the product description, produced little dust. I probably made a total of 60 cuts on my 10"" sliding miter power saw. After about 40 cuts, the noise and dust increased somewhat and the cut lines were not as smooth as the first cut, however, I think this blade could handle another major project. I recommend this product. I would have rated this a 5-star but didn't because I think it's overpriced. I think it should be priced in the $40-$50 range."
5,Hitachi 10-in Hardi-Blade,"I am not a professional builder, but I have re-sided one house and recently completed re-siding a portion of my current house with HardiBoard. Previously, I had used a standard ""diamond-edged"" saw blade, but wore it out quite quickly on HardiBoard. This blade worked exceptionally well, ripping and cross-cutting through HardiBoard like a ""hot knife through butter"". It claims to be ""dust reducing"", which perhaps it was a little bit, but it still kicked up a significant cloud of dust. You will still want to use an appropriate face mask."
3,why so expensive?,"This thing works ok. It is hard to believe it reduces the amount of dust created, as dust is blowing out of the back of the saw as if that were purpose of the operation. It does cut fiber cement siding crisply and repeatedly. My 7"" blade cost $6 and this costs $60, they both work equally well. Go figure!"
5,Work as advertised,"I can't say how much it REDUCES dust, because I never tried to cut with an inappropriate blade for comparison. I CAN say it produces mostly large, sand like dust, heavy enough even to become trapped in a cyclonic dust collector improvised from a trash can and a mulch-vac. It does produce some super fine dust, so wear a resperator, but very little, and this is easily disposed of with wind or a fan and the vacume. I am making my cuts in a very confined space with no filtration other than the cyclonic collector---I was afraid the fine cement dust would blast through that and fill the neighbor's yard, but this absolutely has not been a problem thanks to this blade.Cuts are clean and as fast as wood."
2,last verse same as the first,"uh.....is the next book going to be the same story line yet again? This series started out with some major potential!Which book does this describe?Cashel goes off by himself....Sharina too.... Ilna and Chalcus off together adventuring, Garric doing whatever....they all meet at the end and defeat everybody and everything.....blah blah blah."
1,Save money and time BUY SOMETHING ELSE,"I wouldn't even give this one star if there was an option.Plot: weak at best, just get on with the bloody story!Characters: not very convincingThe author has a way of insulting your intelligence with every page. His constant review of the previous books is annoying. The whole thing is set up like a bad soap opera. If you liked this then you should really seek new authors, there is much better out there."
4,Getting to know Carrie Catt,"This is a good, readable introduction to the life and work of Carrie Chapman Catt. The author skillfully weaves events from Catt's personal life with milestones of the struggle for women's voting rights, a struggle in which Catt was a crucial player. Also to be recommended for readers with a broader interest in the history of the women's rights movement is ""Century of Struggle"" by Eleanor Flexner, which covers developments in the U.S. during the period 1820-1920."
3,Carrie Chapman Catt,It is ok..but I guess I was not made aware this is a children's book so I am donating it to a school library.
2,"Amazon, Ye Scarcely Know Me","I'm only writing this review because some electronic wizard decided that I would rate it a 3 1/2! Actually, I found the book to be not very well written and boring, the heroine(?)an unlikable prig with a chip on her shoulder and the required best-seller happy ending based on a deus ex machina. Notice, however, that I do not give it a ""1"". There are some redeeming features; a pair of enchanting though not very believable twins, and some catering stories that are quite fun.The amazing thing is that you based your judgement of my reading likes and dislikes based on the fact that I read Barbara Kinnsolver and P. D. James. Duh? Binchey can spin a tale, but is hardly in the same league."
1,Asleep at the Switch,"This is the first Binchy book I've read and it will be the last. There are way too many one dimensional characters, most are ""dull as ditchwater,"" (to use a Binchy line) and though the story takes place mainly in Dublin, there is absolutely no sense of place. Rosamunde Pilcher evokes Scotland so brilliantly in her books, and I was hoping Binchy would do the same for Ireland. I did stick with it to the end, but wished I hadn't. As a writer, I can't believe this ever was published - Binchy's agent, editors and publishers were all asleep at the switch on this one."
1,Get on with it!,"Rubbish, I can't beleive that Binchy has got so bad with her writing. The book was too long and painstakingly slow. Just like her last book Tara Road, my only thought was ""Get on with it"""
1,Did I read the same book?,"I came on Amazon to read the reviews, to see how many agreed with my opinion that this is not a good book. I'm surprised at all the praise and agree with the naysayers. Plot-lines that go nowhere(Cathy and the mother-in-law), and, the main character, Cathy, is pretty unlikeable. This book reads like a soap opera and it is too long. I rarely read fiction, except mysteries, and this book reminds me why."
2,Scarlet Feather,"(This review refers to the abridged audio cassette version). This is not one of Maeve Binchy's best books. It is a boring story about a catering company called ""Scarlet Feather"". The names of the characters just ran together and and there was hardly any plot. I couldn't wait until the end of the tape!"
1,disappointing and inaccurate,"I was SOOOO disappointed in this book. The relationship between Neil, and his wife, Cathy's with two charming nine-year-old twins is incorrect in over half the book...they're cousins, not aunt, uncle, neice, nephew....also, it felt as if someone else wrote the manuscript. bad editing as many words were misspelled or simply left out."
2,Waste of Time,"Sorry, but even with the beautiful cover, this book was a waste of time. Now, if you have all sorts of time on your hands, read it. But if you only get moments to read, choose something more satisfying."
2,Ecchhh,"I'm amazed at the number of good reviews of this book. Aside from its appalling length for such a light-weight drama, the dialogue was incredibly amateurish. Definitely *not* one of Binchy's better works."
2,"Maeve,what happened to you?","I was very excited to see Maeve's new novel in my local library! I always feel like reading a new novel by her is like getting a long, chatty letter from an old friend.Little did I know how disappointed I was to be!The character development that she has always been so brilliant at was not there, the plot moved ploddingly along and I felt she was just tired of her characters.........as I was after about 100 pages. Well, I got through 269 out of about 530 pages and decided to call my friend, Jean, who is also a huge Maeve fan to ask her if she had heard any rumors that maybe Maeve had a ghost writer for this one!Sorry, fans, this one was not worth the time for me.........and I loved all of her previous novels!Maeve, I love you.........please go back to fewer characters and deeper plots!"
5,Scarlet Feather,"I really loved this story. I've read all of Ms. Binchy's novels and I found this one to be extra endearing through the characters of Maud, Simon, Lizzie and Muttie. I actually think it would make a really cute movie. I thought Tom was rather hard on Marcella in the end. Though sad, it was no suprise that because Cathy had changed so much as a person through her business that her marriage to Neal dissolved. I was impressed with Ms. Binchy's knowledge about the catering business. As always Ms. Binchy has a genuine way with Irish story telling through her language and humor that just keeps me glued to the pages. I found this novel to be her best so far and Evening Class second."
5,Thoroughly enjoyable good old book,"Just the right amount of reality, chattiness, women's lib, business savvy, drama, friendship, catastrophe...All around a thoroughly absorbing, enjoyable way to slip away from reality for the literary equivalent of a great bubble bath. Binchy always makes me feel like I've spent the time sitting at the kitchen table with her over a cup of coffee while she tells me a story. If only she could write books even faster!"
2,One Step Down,"I love Maeve Binchy, but this latest book just didn't capture my interest like the others I have read. I didn't get very involved with each of the characters, and I ended up not really caring much at all about Cathy's and Tom's catering company. I think there is too little time and too many books- if you start this book and are not fully captivated by it within the first 100 pages, put it down fast."
1,What a disappointment!!,"I have read all of Maeve Binchey's books and loved them, especially the earlier ones. Tara Road was the first hint of disappointment, but I hoped that this book would be more true to Ms. Binchey's talent. It was a struggle to read, and such a disappointment in the end! The book was wordy and the storyline was frustratingly redundant. What was the editor thinking??????"
1,Boring and Poorly Written,"This book is my first Maeve Binchy read--it has been terribly disappointing, and difficult to get through. The text is wordy--with grammatical errors throughout. The characters and storyline read like a soap opera--ie. the characters are stereotypical and lack any depth, and the storyline is predictible from page 1. Don't waste your time!"
3,Not Her Best,"Always with Maeve Binchy there is great detail in the description of characters. So much so that you feel as though you know every one of them. They become like old friends, in most of her books. Scarlet Feather, though filled with great characters, lacked the great story line of her other books.My favorites in the book were the adorable twins, who you had to love by the end. But the story moved slowly in parts, then suddenly a lot of things happen at once.I believe I've read every one of her books. This is not one of my favorites. I did love Circle of Friends though. There is a great one."
4,Every Small Business,Every small business has its own story to tell and in Maeve Binchy's latest book fiction truly echoes reality as a couple trying to establish a small catering business find that they have much more in common than recipes and good manners.The book weaves a long and involved tale about the couple developing the business until the reader is able to believe that this story could be happening next door or down the street from them.As usual Maeve is able to cross national boundaries by focussing on emotions of the heart which know no cultural divides. Although the story might be predictable Maeve creates a few twists along the way. This book was a wonderful way to spend a long weekend. I recommend it to all die hard Maeve Binchy fans.
2,Disappointed!,"After breathlessly awaiting her new book I was given it as a present and rushed right into it. However, it was not typical Maeve Binchy. Perhaps having read book reviews that promised she shed the old Ireland and gave us her version of the new Ireland, mainly with the business end of the theme - the catering establishment- therein lay my disappointment. The story kept one's interest but my main criticism is that it just wasn't the tried and true Maeve. Give me back a Circle ofFriends any day!"
4,A long read,"In my opinion, the book was charming as are most all of her books. I always love the way the characters eventually inter-mingle.I found Neil to be a complete ""jerk!"" Cathy and Tom were adorable. Marcella-- you always knew-- was headed in the wrong direction.As for the setting for the story-- one could easily gain 10 lbs. just by imagining all that fine cuisine.Cathy's parents were such loving people-- and the twins added lots of chaos to the story. A happy ending for them.As always-- the book-jacket of the book (so like ""Tara Road"") is just beautiful! Nice to look at on the coffee table for a long while after you're finished with the reading of the book.All in all, a nice way to spend some leisurely time. And-- lots of pages for your money."
2,Scarlet Feather,I have read every single book Maeve Binchy has written and was eagerly awaiting this one. What a disappointment. It's almost as if someone else wrote it. I kept going expecting it to get better -- but it didn't and I found myself skipping though paragraphs and pages at a hectic clip. Usually when I get close to the end of a Maeve Binchy book I try to slow down in order to make it last as long as possible. Not this time. The character development is shallow and the story is just plain boring. Hope she doesn't leave us with this as her final work!
4,Review: Scarlet Feather,"We are first introduced to Cathy Scarlet and Tom Feather as they have newly formed there catering company, ""Scarlet Feather."" Cathy's mother-in-law disapproves of both Cathy and her new ""hobby"" and her husband Neil doesn't notice as he is only concerned about his job as a civil rights lawyer. Tom is happy with his new enterprise but his family expects him to follow in his father's footsteps. Meanwhile, his girlfriend, Marcella has dreams of her own.From the first page I was caught up into Scarlett Feather and felt indignant on Cathy's behalf. I'm sure many can identify with her. Tom and Marcella are both so sweet, but steadfast in their goals. I love that."
3,COULD TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT---,"This was my first time to read a book by this author...and probably my last. The main thrust of the book was about three families related by marriage or friendship and the trials and tribulations they go through. I wouldn't call the story heartwarming, but they do persevere in the end. One requirement I have for books is that their story needs to be more exciting than my own life and this one just didn't cut it. A fellow reader said she felt this author appealed to an older audience than our mid-forties. Maybe so, but I'd like to think I still wanted a little thrill in my books even 10 to 20 years down the road."
4,A year in the life,"Maeve Binchy is a wonderful story teller with ease to her writing. In her newest novel she wins the prize again. Scarlet Feather centers around a cirle of family and friends and takes place over the course of a year. It tells the tale of friendship, love, and the surprises that come with everyday life. This book was an easy and enjoyable read."
1,Disappointing,This is nothing like some of the other works by this author. I found it more like the terrible writing produced by Danielle Steele. In the future I will review Ms. Binchy's works more carefully before purchasing one of her books.
4,"Great book, Excellent Reader",I really enjoyed the reader. I think a good reader makes a huge difference in audio books.
5,Life Goes On...,"This was an excellent book, not your ordinaryrun-of-the-mill romance. The topic is unique. How many novels are there out there that focus on catering? And by the way,yes itdid include my two favorite things;children, and animals:)Tom and Cathy had met in catering school, and always dreamed of one day opening their own catering business. This is the story of how the two of them built this business from theground up.While life goes on around them, they work together to get their business up and running. Even through many pitfalls,they end up with a place they can be proud of.I loved the writing of this book and feel that Maeve Binchy is one in a million. I like the way that all of theirfamily were included in the book, and each paragraph was devoted to a specific story. It seemed sort of like a soap opera that I really got into.I WANT MORE!!!(please Maeve)I adored this book, and give it 5 stars:)"
3,"A nice story, again","Cathy Scarlet and Tom Feather met in catering school and, apart from being good friends, share a dream: owning their own catering business. On one New Year's Eve, Tom happens on the perfect location. And so begins their first year as entrepreneurs.Binchy, renown for her character development, presents her readers with a full serving of interesting people, some new and some you will remember from previous novels. What I do find about her books, however, is that they are all very similar. The cast is interesting and you do get attached to them, the pace is good, but they read like a good soap opera that has very low-level drama. I for one would like to see Binchy try something different.If you are a devoted Binchy fan, or are looking for a nice, well-written story, then pick up this book, curl up in your favourite chair with a cup of tea, and enjoy. If you are ambivalent about her previous works, then you should pass on this one, as it is a continuation of her last novels."
2,Yawn!,"I was so excited when I saw that Maeve Binchy had a new book out. I've read other books by her and loved them. This book was very long and the plot was predictable, the characters shallow. And so many characters! To hear the same story told by the point of view of 20 different people!"
3,Hopes and dreams,"One of the things Maeve Binchy is especially good at is incorporating characters from earlier books into the following ones, and she did this well in Scarlet Feather. The story is vintage Binchy, Cathy and Tom are engaging characters, and the glimpses into the complexities of running a food business ring true. The subplot involving the modeling business is also well done. At its most basic, this is a tale about fulfilling dreams, a process that usually turns out differently than expected by the dreamers. Though set, of course, in Ireland, this is a story dealing with the sorts of ambitions, joys and problems that could happen anywhere. I listened to the audio version, which is narrated with style by Barbara Rosen. My only complaint about Scarlet Feather is its length. Too many words to tell too little story. Cut by about 75 pages, this novel could be rated 4 stars."
4,"Not the most spectacular, but still wonderful","I really liked this book. I don't think it's nearly as good as Tara Road, but it was worth the read. I found that Maeve Binchy ties in a lot of characters from Tara Road and other previous books in Scarlet Feather. The story was well set--it's a little predictable at times, and the ending was not surprising to me. She kept dropping hints here and there throughout the book. I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves Binchy and say that you will not waste your money reading it."
3,"Last, but not best","I'm an avid Binchy fan who couldn't wait to read Scarlet Feather. 380 pages into it, I finally gave up on it. Cathy Scarlet and Tom Feather, cooking school friends who start their own catering business, are both genial but bland characters. Trouble develops in their respective love relationships, leaving me predicting the book's end. Typical of Binchy books, there are a score of characters, whose various situations become too tedious to care about. I feel as though I've lost a friend I had always counted on to deliver a charming and warm story. If you have patience and enjoy a lukewarm read, try it. But for true Binchy gold, try Echoes or Circle of Friends."
2,surprised that I didn't enjoy it,"I love Maeve Binchy, having read everything she's written since Light a Penny Candle. The Glass Lake is my favorite. In Scarlet Feather, I found myself thinking, ""she's off her game"" It seemed predictable, and, for me, just dragged on and on. The bits where each of the characters was touched on with a paragraph, switching from one to another was trying. It was like a repeated, ""meanwhile back at the ranch"".Some things didn't make sense, mostly that neither Tom, Cathy or the police suspected the evil cousin for the robbery & vandalism. It would seem standard procedure for the police to suspect a recently fired employee, and Tom & Cathy were not so stupid that they'd never have thought of this-it was so obvious. This was irritating.I'm now reading Quentins, which I find better than Scarlet Feather. Still, I think I enjoy Maeve Binchy more when she travels back in time, though I did like Tara Road."
3,a good but predictable read,"This book is written in the Maeve Binchy style that her readers have grown to love, but it is by no means her best work. The story of Tom and Cathy is interesting, but Binchy writes too many side stories that distract from the main plot. Also, while her last book, Tara Road, was unpredictable and contained a few surprises, this book was far too predictable. So overall it is worth reading, but don't expect to be enamored."
5,Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant,I have listened Scarlet Feather 5 times over the last few years. Great on audio. Fascinating story of young caterers starting out. All their families are wonderful characters and the story binds together incredibly. Don't walk to order this one RUN.
3,Please Maeve don't end it here!,"As an devoted reader of Meave Binchy I was left somewhat disappointed by this her *last* novel. As with some of the other reviewers, I noticed a definate departure from her usual vivid character development. Muttie, Simon and Maud were probably the most in depth in the book and they aren't the central characters! I did however, like the reference to characters from other novels. Dispite it's somewhat flat characters, I did enjoy the book just not as much as The Glass Lake. So if you've not read Meave Binchy before, don't start here, check out some of her older novels like The Glass Lake, Light a Penny Candle or The Copper Beech.I truly hope this is not Maeve last novel. I can understand the need for a rest, but with a gift like her's it seems almost a sin not to share it with the world."
3,A well written story by the late Maeve Binchy,"Bubblebathbooks.net (aka Bubby and Sissy) invites you to sit down in a comfy chair with a warm cup of chamomile and become involved in the world of Scarlet Feather by Maeve Binchy. You'll meet Tom and Cathy and their spouses, families, and friends, and you'll follow their stories, good and bad; happy and sad. In the end you'll feel like you've known them all your life. Bubby waxes philosophic on the hard choices these characters have to make, and Sissy is just glad that everything works out well in the end, even though she'd like to slap Cathy's husband Neil and all his family. A satisfying, well-written story. Read our full review at [...]"
2,It's no Tara Road,"I really enjoyed Tara Road and I thought I would give more of Maeve Binchy's works a try. This was not one of her best pieces. No 8 year old children speak like that. Cathy said it was a shame for the children to go back to their parents when they were almost HUMAN! Cathy continued to drink knowing that she was pregnant. After going into detail with the children about the code for the shop and mentioning several times that the children had big mouths, how could it not occur to them that the children told someone the code? Does Maeve think we're all stupid or does she not care?"
2,Wasn't my favorite,"I really like Maeve Binchy, but I found this book disappointing. I always enjoyed how her characters came full circle at the end. This one does a little, but it is not as fulfilling. I didn't feel this was her best at all."
5,A Thoroughly Delightful Book,"This is my first book by this author. Although I've noticed her books in the library, I'd never checked one out. This is a delightful story of a family in Dublin doing ordinary things described so well by the author. There are enough crazy relatives to please everyone.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read something that is satisfying and entertaining. An insider's look at the catering business. Be prepared to be hungry at all of the descriptions of food!"
4,"With faults, but still hard to put down","This is one of those books which I don¡t really know the reason why it¡s impossible to put down once I started reading it.The story is about the struggles and triumphs of Tom Feather and Cathy Scarlett who pursued their dreams and started a catering business. They are complemented by a colourful and lively cast of characters, who add much dimension to the story. The story is sometimes heartbreaking and someimes innocent. This is one of her best books.However, the story made me strangely sad because it seems to say ¡V you win some, you lose some. In the pursuit of their dreams, Tom and Cathy seem to have also lost something, or rather, someone precious. They have both lost someone who share their passion to pursue their dreams, just because the dreams they are chasing are different.The other fault is that the ending is too fairy-tale for my liking and interesting characters such as June and Shona are not fully developed."
1,A big disappointment,"I enjoyed many of Maeve Binchy's novels and was eagerly awaiting this one as well. However, I must say it was extremely disappointing, especially in view of her other books. The characters were uninteresting and the storyline was dull and boring. This novel was really below par for someone of Ms. Binchy's writing abilities."
4,An Entertaining Purposeful Read,"This ""business novel"" tells the story of a hot company that begins to lose its edge due to complacency and lack of focus among its leadership - characteristics that are evident in the weekly senior staff meetings. Using movie making as an analogy, Lencioni charts an entertaining, easy to grock way to revamp regular meetings so that participants are engaged, enabling them to make critical decisions and energize their teams. For anyone who's been caught up in circular discussions during meetings and spends endless time on emails -- whether about strategy, budget, product development, sales or the work culture--this book seeds the possibility that groups of people who work together can learn to keep in touch and make decisions efficiently if they follow simple meeting guidelines."
4,"A ""How To"" for Meetings",Great read to help improve those routine and boring business meetings.This book gives you some real food for thought on how to lead and run a meeting.
3,Victim of its own Hypothisis,"Of all Patrick Lencioni's fables, Death by Meeting falls short of its morals. The Hook (setting the stakes) takes almost half the book before the action begins. There is little conflict (a recurring theme through his books) in this story.The Five Dysfunctions of a Team is a powerful set of lessons wrapped in a compelling story (we get to know and care about the characters and their flaws and how some of them overcome those flaws, while others are consumed by them.)The Five Temptations of a CEO is one man's journey on subconscious train trip without much conflict but its a very fast read.If you're in a real hurry with any of these books, go to the summary in the back, you'll get all you need in a few short pages."
1,let me save you $16.47,"Have short, to the point meetings, and have things decided at them.This book drones on and on with a truly rephrensible made-up example. It is diadic generally very poorly written. The advice is trite and quite frankly intuative."
3,The Meeting,"This was my first time to order a book on CD. Overall, it was fairly good however, the issue with a cd is that it is one dimensional."
4,Great Read for Leaders,Lencioni gives a great story of bad meeting and a great ending. This book is for anyone who wants to develop a good style for meeting that are productive and meaningful.
1,Death by Bad Writing,"The premise of the meeting structure that the author proposes could be summed up in one page. Instead, the ""fable"" continues for over 200 pages. The meeting structure is interesting, though not a new idea at all. Read the executive summary and skip the rest."
1,Ugh! The worst,I have read all of Lencionni's other books and this one is a real disappointment. I didn't believe a single second of it. Please have the major character come to our company; he would be lynched in a minute.
1,Completely unbelievable,"I agree with the other one-star reviews for this totally fabricated story. I mean, come on! This would simply never happen in the real corporate world, where new people are never listened to until they have ""paid their dues"" (and sometimes not even then!) The idea that meetings have some relationship to movies (if only) is just too precious for words, but some people apparently want to believe it can happen. I don't agree. I would love to see meetings improved in some meaningful way, but I don't think this book is going to make a substantive difference."
1,"Skip the feeble, er, fable","The story lacks life and is poorly written. What could have been an engaging 20-page short story ended up as dozens of 3-5 page chapters in large type with wide margins. You'll find yourself skimming for substance which you won't find until at least half-way through. Read the executive summary, don't waste your time on the rest."
3,"A tad cheesy, but easy to read business book.",A good book- presents the problems organizations deal with by having ineffective meetings (both from a lack of constructive/intellectual conflict and from poor strucure) through a fictional story. The format makes it an easy read but a tad on the cheesy side- the content was good and I think the author makes some good points but the story line was pretty weak. I have seen elements of the meeting recommendations implemented successfully in the organizations I've worked for and believe it will help me in the future.
5,Don't Wait for Another Dull Meeting,"Ever wonder why you can be intrigued with a 90-minute movie with little relevance to your daily life and be completely bored to death by a workplace meeting? Patrick Lencioni's book is an engaging leadership fable that defines what makes meetings engaging. Comparing a movie to a meeting, he insists the top two reasons meetings are not productive is the lack of drama and lack of contextual structure. While a tad less insightful than his previous books (The Five Dysfunctions of a Team, The Five Temptations of a CEO and The Four Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive), Lencioni continues to deliver a good, quick read with practical information that any leader can use. His discussion of the four different types of meetings is worth the price of the book alone. So what are you waiting for? Another dull meeting?"
3,"OK, nothing earth-shattering","I really like the way that a fictional story was used to drive home the main point, but have to admit that I was expecting more. The main concept could probably be described in depth within about 3 or 4 pages of text (max)."
5,Breathe Life Back into Your Meetings,"This explains in a fun written, step by step plan, how to bring your meetings to a new level. We all have been to the meeting you hated to be at.....what makes them turn from ho-hum to productive? Must read for any level of management."
4,Some Sound Ideas,"Death by Meeting provides some sound ideas for implementation within a business; however, I could have done without all the drama of the fictional story. The summaries are very helpful as I plan to keep this book at my desk for future reference. Recommended for anyone whose profession requires continuous meeting and project responsibilities."
4,Eye Opener,Was one of the must read in my professional life. I can say this book was an eye opener that helped me to realize the very nature of what I do everyday at work.
4,It only makes it more painful,"Another ""easy read"" by Lencioni: not a jargon filled tome filled with executive psychobabble.He lays out a interesting paradigm for approaching meetings.My only complaint is that he's made sitting in meetings even more painful! Now the dysfunctionality is painfully clear."
3,Quick reading,"Although this book is a quick read, it could have reached its point in less then half the time. If your in a hurry read the first several chapters, skip to the last several and get the solution. Would not have read it if it was not needed for a book report."
3,Not funny,"The title is funny and attracted me to the book, because I have literally lost more than 1000 hours of my life to horrible meetings. I was hoping the book would be really funny. It wasn't. It is an allegory or fable that demonstrates serious theory about how meetings should be conducted. That's fine, but that was not what I was hoping for when I purchased the book."
2,Not as good as his earlier works,"Meetings are a problem, but Patrick could have used the analogies from 5 Temptations or Obsessions. The story and model are stretched thin and lack the umph of his earlier works."
3,Good Ideas Wrapped in a Mediocre Story,"The title, ""Death by Meeting,"" really spoke to me as someone who has experienced my share of really bad meetings. Patrick Lencioni presents a compelling structure for meetings based around the concept of storytelling. Great ideas; his meeting structure could eliminate many bad meetings.In terms of criticism, I thought the fable part of the book was mediocre. A mediocre story line is kind of ironic given the fact that the premise of the book revolves around effective storytelling.I did enjoy the book, but I would have been just as happy with a one-page outline of the meeting structure. I would not recommend this book for someone without enough patience to enjoy the slow development of the ideas -- they would get more value from a one-page outline. I would recommend this book for someone who wants to savor the concepts and retains information better when it is dramatized. I'd also recommend it to anyone who wants to improve the quality of meetings."
3,"This case study is useful, but you can skip to the end","This books reads like the countless cases I've read during my university days. While it certainly helps paint a picture, for those looking to cut to the point, you can skip to the last section where the author lists what meetings you should hold and the ways to hold them. It terms of take always, it is light but for those who have tons of meetings every week the takeaways are meaningful. I know I'll be giving his suggestions a go at my workplace.My only beef is that I could have just read the last dozen pages to get to the same place. But I will say, this would make a great instructional video - and maybe that's how it should be presented."
4,Highlights Good and Bad Meeting Practices,"Patrick Lencioni highlights both good and bad meeting practices in ""Death by Meeting."" Meetings are a central component of the day-to-day operations at most modern businesses, and this book addresses the ""practice"" of meetings in a direct, head-on and meaningful fashion.Some of my take-aways from this book were...meetings can be run poorly in many ways and the downstream effects of bad meetings are potentially significant and many.Written in Lencioni's ""fable and Model"" style, I found the Model for good meetings to be, in large part, useful. Different teams/organizations will likely need to modify the Model as put forth in this book to be most effective, but I found the overall framework to be quite useful.I recommend this book to anyone who spends some of their time in meetings...if nothing else, the book offers a refreshing and unique viewpoint of meetings in general."
4,Teaching through narative,"My reason for purchasing this book was a weekly unfulfilling church staff meeting. I knew that there was potential for so much more, but I didn't know how to reach that next level. I heard this book was good, but when I first picked it up to read my goal was to fall asleep as soon as possible...2 1/2 hours later I had to set it down-not because I wanted to but because I had to get up early the next morning. Lencioni's style of instruction is pleasantly refreshing. Not only does Lencioni present his ideas and rationale, but he does so in such a way that you can see how it might work in real life. This is not, however, a comprehensive source--you will learn what is supposed to happen, but you'll have to practice how to do so yourself (Lencioni says the same). I recommend this book as a way to grasp the concept of organizational meetings."
3,Some Good Ideas: Took Awhile To Get There,Interesting idea of a fictional story to bring out key points for meetings and culture. We looked at the big ideas as a team and implemented a few. Like the resources he provides on the Web site for keeping meetings strategic and having different types of meetings for different purposes. Overall a good and quick read.
4,Good for learning the basics of a meeting,This gives a great layout of the many meetings that take place in work places. For those who have managed or lead people and organizations for more than a few years it will be a review.I recommend it for any new manager or leader. The movie analogies work well too.
4,Great for the price,"I am very satified with the Delta Unit...it does move a great deal of air. Easy to install and remote unit is great. It hangs from my ceiling a bit crooked, becuase the weight is all shifted to the side with the motor....this is the only air cleaner I've ever owned - so they may all be like this. Fit an finish were good & I had no problems with damage. Not perfect...but a very good performer. After research - I chose this unit over JET."
2,3 Pocket filter is way too much money to replace,"I love the air filter unit, but the 3 pocket filter that captures the 1 micron stuff fills fast (better than in my lungs I know) but it is expensive to replace. The electrostatic filter, if you need one, can be found elsewhere for 15 bucks and not $50 so shop around! My other complaint about the unit is that you have to do some rigging to make it hang from the joists but it can be done. Be careful not to bend up the box when doing so though!"
3,Concerened about quality,"When I recieved this 50-875, it had a dent in the corner by the back filter making it impossible to remove the filter. Please note that on the shipping box it came in, there was NO damage therefore it leads me to believe that it came from the factory like this. Anyway, I had to use pliers to bend the frame back so I can get the filter out. Now it works. As far as doing what it's supposed to, it Works as advertised."
4,Air Cleaner,"I just bought this air cleaner as a second unit. I allready had the single speed Delta unit that this replaced. I could tell the difference automatically......Works GREAT!!! I would buy another.Did not give it 5 stars because I had my old one wired to a switch in my shop to turn it on and off. With this it will not turn on and off with the switch. The new one, I now use a remote due to the three speeds."
4,Woodworker,"This filter was installed in a basement workshop and suspended from the flooring beams above by chains. There is no noticeable vibration and the noise, even at high speed, does not bother the wife in the upstairs area. I was able to get it in place by myself, but this is best accomplished by two people. It moves a lot of air, and so far, after only a month of service, I'm pleased with the unit."
2,Delta disappointment,"The fan was bent so it rubbed as soon as I turned it on. It was obvious it was out of alignment by 1/2"". Called the manufacturer to find a service center. The service center informed my that Delta had been purchased by a Chinese company and they couldn't stock parts. They had to order from a centralized parts depot which would take a week to arrive. Still waiting to try it."
3,Maybe not as effective as others.,"If you have a dust collector, you still need this because dust collectors do not get nearly all of the wood dust, especially from table saws. After I bought this, I read a review that showed other ones were more effective. Particularly, running on the lowest speed is more effective because it does not raise a much dust from benches and tables. I have this and a 3HP collector and still get some dust on the floor.Table saws are the most problematic because the blade, running af a very high speed carries the dust out from under the table. A dust hood is the only way to capture some of this dust."
1,Don't judge this book by its cover,"I will admit right off that the beautiful cover of this book caught my eye. Then I read the back - Picasso like painter and his muse, Provence, the French Resistance, and a love story! It sounded fantastic. It wasn't. I don't know if it is because I find the letter format tiresome to read or the unrealistic nature of these letters (describing things that the intended receipient would already know) or if it was the ludicrous attempts at eroticism and lyrical writing, either way - I could barely finish this book (a rare thing for me). I found the characters unbelievable, the situation annoying, and the big secret revealed at the end a terrible anticlimax. I want to give it away to save other readers from having to wade through this but I won't... email me if you want to know why he left Louise."
1,"Soppy, sloppy love story","A very disappointing read. The first part (before Louise joins the resistance during World War II), is written as if by an adolescent fantasizing about being an adult. I understand the final chapters are more interesting, but I just couldn't go on. I'm giving the book one star (rather than none) as a token of faith in Sanchez...who, this book notwithstanding, is a wonderful writer."
2,"Good Premise, Poor Execution","The premise of this book was great; the execution of that premise was simply dreadful. I did manage to finish, but it was a real trial.I thought it very believable that someone deeply in love would write passionate letters and then never mail them, if not mailing them was for the best during politically turbulent times. What I didn't buy was the fact that had the letters been real, the writer of those letters was telling the recipient things both of them already knew, things that were for the reader's benefit only. Shame on the author for making this very basic literary mistake!I found the writing in the book to be over-the-top in a dreadful (there is no other word to use) sort of way. It turned what was supposed to be several tragedies, actually, into an almost-comedy. Only the dark subject matter kept me from laughing out loud.I could write more, but let's just say this is one of the worst books I have ever read and let it go at that."
2,Very disappointing.,"I am going to be honest about this book. I couldn't get past page 29. Oh, I tried, believe me, but it is just so laborious and contrived. I suggest that the reader look carefully at all reviews before opening this book."
3,"slow, erotic, dramatic","If you are not a 100% true romantic in heart, skip this book. If you have longed for someone, for something that is greater than yourself once in your life, you will probably enjoy this highly dramatic and erotic book. I am a big fan about letters and romance, and I think the writing is exquisitely beautiful. Though, at times I find this book too slow and too outrageous for readers like me to accept. However, I greatly appreciate the writer's effort of offering a magical, somewhat out-of-ordinary love story to our almost too ordinary lives."
4,Simply a magnificant escape,"I've become disenchanted with American's views on literature after reading the other reviews.This book is a comedy -- a masterful comedy, with tons of wit. If you can read with a light heart and an open mind, you will experience one of the richest novels you have ever cracked open. The author is brilliant and rare among contemporary writers in writing something that is not a screenplay, but an enjoyable read. This book is an experience in itself. Don't miss the opportunity to enjoy an American writer who will be remembered as one of our best."
4,A Nice Historical Book...,"This book is a nice historical reference, but some of the information is old or out-of-date. But this is because this is a reprint of Jane's 46/47 edition. The photos are usually of bad quality, but they didn't have digital cameras and other silly technoloogy back then. That being said, it's interesting browsing."
3,Jane's Fighting Ships Of W.W.ll,"As a youngster I lived in Hawaii during the war.With all the navy ships that we saw, all my friends were proud of the way that we could identify all naval ships. After the war ,in our school library came the most wonderfull book. JANE'S SHIPS OF THE WORLD. It answerd so many questions that we could only ask ourselves because of the era. Maybe I was looking to ""go home again"",with the help of this book. But the pictures looked like photo copies, and many of the latter ships from all countries were left out of the book. I still believe this is the diffinitive work that covers this subject, and it's the best reference book of it's time."
3,"Historically interesting, but not a good reference","I was searching for a reference book about ALL the warships involved in the Second World War and belonging to EVERY nation (a too ambitious demand?); I saw the title ""Jane's..."", read a customer's comment and decided to buy this book. When I received it I felt a little disappointed, because the book wasn't exactly what it seemed to be. It has a value as an historycal document, being the reprint of past Jane's edition (of wartime); as such it cannot have what I instead expected to find, such as data about the war losses, the war construction (some navies are almost complete, some other expecially the Axis ones are not), and so on. So my search for a definitive reference about the second world war's navies, is not concluded jet (by the way: if you have some title to suggest me...). To come to an end, this is not a bad book, as could seem from this review; but, surely, it's not the right book for me!"
3,Not what I was hoping for...,"Perhaps I was expecting something different. While it is a comprehensive listing of a wide variety of ships from the era, it has some obvious informational gaps. For a relative neophyte like myself to notice omissions of certain ships is a little suprising. I had also hoped for some background history on some of the more significant types. However, the info contained in this book is very technical in nature. Also, being a modeler, I was disappointed by the small dark photos. Many are no better than silouettes. The illustrations are adequate. In short, if you are looking for more than a by the numbers listing of dimensions, armaments, and other statistics, look elsewhere."
1,More is not better,"Like Conway's Ships of the World (different war eras), Jane's Fighting Ships tries to cover much too much ground with obsolete data. Jane's was formerly published by the English Fred T. Jane on an annual basis and as an annual was only as accurate as its contributing editors from each nation could be, i. e. they depended on official data released by the individual countries which tried to cover up as much as possible. Even in 1947, little was published on YAMATO and accurate information on the Axis navies was still rare. The author fails in his attempt to produce a compendium of WWII naval strength. Subsequent naval writing with more current information has rendered his book worse than useless."
3,"lots of data, but partly incomplete","On one hand, this is THE book for shiplovers who want to know about each countrie's naval power in WWII. Not only the giant battleships and aircraft carriers are referred to, as usually, but also those additional craft like minelayers, PT boats, Coast Guard Cutters, small torpedo boats, training ships, and so on. On the other hand, information about some navies is incomplete, even partly wrong. This refers to the Imperial Japanese Navy, but also the Russian Navy. And you should better not look closely at what is written about German warships. I think one should not see the book as a complete compilation, but rather as a historical reflection of the insight the ALLIES had AT THE TIME. Although the pictures are fine, the drawings are not. As a model builder, I would have appreciated drawings of the quality presented by Breyer's ""Battleships and Battlecruisers 1905-1970"" or Gröner's compilation of the German Navy."
5,An excellent and detailed review of WWII ships.,"This is masterful account of the naval ships used during WWII. It is for, especially, the enthusiast who wants a detailed look into these amazing fighting machines. The authors provide a detailed examination of these ships. If you have ever read any of the other books put out by Janes-on the world's aircraft or battlefield equipment, for example-you will know what I'm talking about. This book gives the reader many pictures of WWII ships, from most of the navies involved in this conflict, including many statistics on the ships' capabilities. This is for the serious student of either naval vessels or the battles of WWII."
5,Historical Sketch of Roxborough...,"Product is perfect for a milestone birthday, and as always your service was terrific. My husband was very happy with the gift!"
2,meh... user error or bad product?,"Yes, it has a long handle (perfect for reaching inside my omega paw litter box without opening the top) and yes, it's metal, so it's durable and you can bend the scoop part to suit your needs.BUT... It is not big enough, or deep enough (even with mild bending of the sides) to ""hold"" the clump of litter while shaking, etc. to remove the clean litter. This means that you can only successfully use it to scoop right off the top of the litter (if you don't mind loosing some clean litter too). It scrapes the bottom of the box well, but again, is too shallow to scoop up (and out of the pile of litter) the clump that you scraped up.This scoop was cheap and might work better for someone else, but I think that my plastic scoops work better and were just as cheap... Only real advantage is the long handle."
2,"""The best book out there on raster modeling"" (unfortunately)","I have to agree with the above review - over-simplified explainations of the easier topics, then no information on the more difficult ones. A glossary of some of the more complicated terminology would also be EXTREMELY helpful. The diagrams that are included are confusing, particularly the ones that contain mistakes! I am disappointed with this book, but according to my professor this is the best book available right now. COULD SOMEONE PLEASE WRITE A BETTER BOOK????"
4,It was pretty good,"We used this book in a class several years ago. It was a little dense, but most text books are. It was quite good, and now that I'm teaching GIS to high school kids, I have refered to it several times in order to help describe a concept or technique.It's probaly not the best, but it's pretty good for the price."
4,GIS Raster Review,"This book provides a clear and consice review of the use of Raster Modeling for GIS. There are sections of objectives, review chapter summaries, and chapter questions that are very helpful."
3,A great teaching tool,"This book came to my attention several years ago through a hometown newspaper and is a great source for samples of poor writing and bad story telling. Unless you are a writing teacher looking of samples like those mentioned, don't buy this book; it is very difficult to follow. If you are a teacher, you will find the book useful. It's not often you come across something this bad that has remained in print--although it is a bit pricey for school use.A great exercise is to assign a section of the book for your students to edit. It is a great teaching tool."
3,Nursing ethics,Book is OK. Condition the book arrived acceptable but did not match description of book condition. Easy to read book. Bood is older but content still applies.
3,Authors' bias is evident,The book is ok. The main problem with it is that this is a book on ethics and the authors' personal political persuasions are very evident in regards to issues such as abortion (they appear to be very proabortion).
3,the blush was a disappointment,"this blush was a disappointment, there is no color at all when applied and so i would not recommend it to anyone,sorry but it is the truth..and as alwayspeace and love,sal"
1,I should as well just pinched my face,"this product did nothig for me, you could barely notice that I had it on, did not like it at all"
5,Enlightening,Filled with information we never realized. The press tell only the negatives and this book astounds us with mighty positives.
3,"My kids really like it, but Max is a baby talking whinner, so I prefer the books.","My Children like these episodes and will ask to watch them often. We allow very limited video/programming consumption and most often choose non fiction or more educational shows. I am sure my kids (5 and 2) would rate this five stars. overall the story lines are okay (although the parents seem absent)what I can not stand is Max and the whining and baby talk. We have never spoken baby talk to our children (not even when they were babies) and they do not speak baby talk...unless they have recently watched an episode of Max and Ruby. I do enjoy the Max and Ruby books, Max drives away is a favorite of my two year old. So these episodes are great if whining does not bother you!"
1,Ugh,"I loathe Max & Ruby, but it was the only series that I could find a Thanksgiving episode for my kids to watch. Seriously, where are their parents? Why is Ruby such a brat? And what's wrong with Max???"
1,heavy !,"it is not worth buying this phone. It is bulky and the keypad is hard to press. My fingers hurt when I dial. headset becomes hot when talking for more than 10 minutes. Battery life is terribly low! i think less than 90min talk time. Phonebook has only 200 entries--you cannot make separate entries for the same person like mobile, office/home like in the newer models.There are much better phones in Nokia at the higher level.bottom line: not worth a try!"
4,Quiet Ringtones,"This phone is excellent in all respects, save one -- the ringtones are very quiet, so quiet in fact, that at the highest volume, they're difficult to hear outdoors. If you remove the battery, then put it back in again, the volume goes back to ""normal"", but they're still quiet, even on level 5. If you don't need loud tones when your phone rings, I highly recommend this phone. As others have said, the display is excellent -- even for someone like me, who is visually impaired."
5,Great Basic Handset!,I bought this phone with prepaid plan for my 45+ year old aunt who is not a tech fan and she is totally loving this gift! at
1,"LEMON edtion Nokia DON""T BUY","I got this phone as free upgrade to replace my old faithful 8260. When it finally gave up after 4 yrs & three family members worth of hard use, I was glad to choose it's updated cousin. That is until I got the phone. For some, reason some people who I contact regularly could not receive ANY audio from this phone. Even with full signal strength on both ends. Called ATT they said this was a known defect with some phones & they would gladly replace it.. The Second 2260 was tolerable until just after the 30 day warrenty expired. As I was entering a # the keyboard locked. on the # 2When this happens all you can do is try to turn phone off & wait until decindes to work again. This is also a well know defect to ATT & now to me Don't take the chance of finding others"
2,Poor reception,"This phone does not work in many of the places my old Nokia did, e.g., my house, my car, parked by any building, etc. or inside a store. It is virtually useless. I think it is the internal antenna that causes the problem. I am returning it and reactivating my 5 year old Nokia with external antenna."
1,"Don't buy it unless you absolutely need it, and even then....pass.","Yay, another white-bashing book! Another sterling example of what's wrong with the White Guilt crowd. It was purchased as 'required reading' for a college class that was being taught by a psycho instructor who insisted that white people were responsible for every evil imaginable....never mind she was whiter than rice herself. This book is only a couple of steps away from insisting that whites need to be quarantined away from the rest of humanity...."
2,Too detailed,I've tried 2x to finish this and I just cannot bring myself to do it. I might try a 3rd time since it's been 10 years.
5,The Most Excellent Biscuit Pan!,"Length:: 3:31 MinsThis is a video review on the Lodge Biscuit pan. It is really great and it makes the biscuits nice and crispy on the edges and the bottom, but so mouth watering when you bite into the middle of them! Matt shows you this biscuit pan and tells you about it."
5,Biscuit pan,"I love these biscuit pan. I baked biscuit, cornbread, eggs, hamburger, you get the idea here. I love cooking with cast iron pans. I owned a few of lodge pans and being cooking from them for several years now. I take really good care of them and my pans still look new. I recently purchased a 5 qt. Lodge deep skillet with a glass lid. It was a joy to cook with. Cooking with cast iron is better for your health compared to non-stick pans. Lodge pans is made in the USA."
5,Excellent,I love biscuits and this is a fantastic cookware for a batchelor who likes to eat well but and just learning how to cook. One thing missing is the loving hands of a woman who prepares it but until God provides her I just have to learn for myself and I highly recommend this for both married couples and singles.
3,Not so Excellent after the 1st use,"I baked last night, and the little breads came out excellent. It's a good product, but bear in mind that it requires washing without soap before using it, and then oil it.Addendum: after washing it, I noticed a reddish deposit...is this rust? This thing is made in USA, so I can't even say it's Chinese crap."
5,"Not just for biscuits, of course","First, be sure you preheat and spray generously with Pam. I thought it would be just for biscuits-- nope! It can also make muffins, cupcakes (although they'll be shorter and wider than normal), brownies, mini meatloafs, mini quiches, and eggs!"
5,Just like Mom STILL makes!,"You can spend a lot of money on Calphalon, Wolfgang Puck, whatever, but you won't find ANYTHING that will cook your cornbread muffins better than this pan. Just pour in your favorite recipe, VOILA!"
4,Drop Biscuit Pan,"Lodge Logic Pre-Seasoned Drop Biscuit PanI like this pan, it is very heavy though, you will need to be careful if you have a smooth top stove or granite couter tops. It needs to be pre seasoned before using, even though it is described as already having been 'pre seasoned'. It is just the right size to make bread for breakfast sandwiches.It is a quality pan and will just get better with use. Rita"
5,Drop Biscuit Pan,This Cast Iron biscuit pan is the greatest thing since sliced bread. You can use it with from scratch recipes or canned biscuits. If you use canned biscuit you will have one left over because it only holds seven.
2,Tweety Universal Fit Bucket Covers Review,"While the item was very cute, I was rather disappointed because I was lead to believe that I would be receiving two seat covers as opposed to one. Therefore, I had to purchase another. The seat covers are supposed to be universal but they do not quite fit the seats of a van."
4,Tweety <3,"I love this seat cover a ton. It's great on my leather seat and I figure I will purchase another one for my passanger side. The only downer is sometimes it slips off sort of, but it doesn't come off all the way. Cute buy especially if you are a tewwty lover like me :)"
3,um i think its pretty good,"i think its pretty good especialy ""tubthumper"".i think if they made another cd they could be more popular."
2,"Looks good, snazzy retraction, doesn't doesn't work","This antenna didn't bring in signals any better than the handheld ham radio's internal antenna. I haven't had the opportunity to try it in various locations, but I'm thinking unless I've got perfect reception with the internal antenna (no room for improvement) which is NOT the case, then I should see an improvement with this external one... I don't!"
3,Good little performer,"I tried my Sangean ANT-60 Portable Short Wave Antenna with my Sangean 505, I did not notice any significant improvement with reception, but then again at the time I am living in a rather large city (Mexico City, the biggest in the World).I took my little radio and antenna on a recent vacation to the US Virgin Islands and attempted to pick up some radio stations from the French Caribbean with the built in whip antenna. I had some luck, but when I connected the ANT-60 I had some improved reception, I was very happy with the result.I recommend this antenna for non-crowded radio environment."
1,Don't buy. Doesn't work.,"First, one needs to understand that this ""antenna"" is just a wind-up cable that is 23 feet (8 meters) long. It's nothing else whatsoever.So where does laying out a 23 feet cable qualify as an ""antenna""? Ans: no one can say for sure. You may get a boosted signal, you may get nothing. You won't even know if the cable has broken internally due to pulling on it to hard.It's also extremely annoying to wind and unwind -- just pulling doesn't unwind it -- you need to manually unwind and the wind it again.What a joke."
1,Sangean ANT 60 Shortwave Antenna,This antenna did nothing to improve my shortwave radio reception it was a waste of money. I would not spend the money for it.
2,"Nice, but isn't strong enough",I had it shortly and one snag and all is gone. You get what you pat for. Secure up & out of the way carefullly.
3,it works,this thing is just a hunk of wire. it works just like any other piece of wire. it just is on a spool that lets you wind it back in. nothing magic here.
4,Good for what it is,"This isn't a magic shortwave-attracting antenna, it's a simple wire that can be plugged into the shortwave (if it has a jack) or clipped to the aerial if there's no antenna jack. Try a couple of different orientations and you can usually improve the reception of a handheld shortwave significantly. There is a similar Kaito antenna that is harder to wind back up, but is otherwise the same. I also have an older Sony-branded antenna that appears to be identical.This antenna is nice and portable, fits in my portable radio carrying case, and gives a decent boost to reception. It's not magic though and you could, in fine DIY fashion, hook up 20 feet of wire to your shortwave for much the same effect."
1,not so hot,"the at-60 did little to improve reception period. I listen to the radio on the 2nd floor of a wooden home and have the ant strung across a window. With or without it, reception is about the same."
4,Not bad for the price,"Not a bad device for its price. Great for packing into small spaces, emergency situations, backup use, etc. It would be great if it were spring loaded, but its not, hence if you pull out all 20+ feet then you must wind all of it back in by hand. Even the hand winding would be bearable if there was some sort of pop-out handle or something, but all that is provided is a small indent in the casing in which your finger is supposed to swivel as you wind it up. This is not the best design in general, but its that much harder if you have larger fingers."
2,I Expected More...,"Due to the predominantly good reviews and great Sangean reputation, I expected more from this antenna. It's easy to use, but did not improve reception on any of my radios. I tried using it on a shortwave radio, a weather radio, and a regular AM/FM radio. I could not sense a difference in reception either with, or without, use of the antenna. Sure, it could have to do with my geographical location or other factors. But after three failed attempts on three different radios, I am sure that the antenna holds some degree of responsibility."
4,Good antenna for shortwave radios,"I bought this to expand my SONY shortwave radio reception, which was virtually zero before. It has done pretty well but for hardcore enthusiasts there are better options out there."
2,Short Wave,"I live in an appartment complex which is brick and I don't get cell phone signals,so I didn't get much from this antenna from my appartment.I will try again outdoors and give another review at a latter date.Two stars for now not knowing how this works yet,nice concept if it works outdoors.Very portable."
4,OKAY FOR WHAT IT IS.,"This item will not fix everything.But,its compact andeasy to take with you.I feel its a good deal for the price."
4,Increased reception.,"This short wave antenna has increased my reception on my shortwave radio by more than 50% over just using the radios own antenna. It has increased my reception on all bands including AM, FM, TV, and shortwave bands. Installing the add on antenna is a breeze. Highly recommended."
1,Sangean ANT-60 shortwave antenna,I have excellent reception with my Grundig G3 shortwave radio but I thought I could make it even better with the Sangean ANT-60 antenna. I was greatly disappointed.The reception is better without the antenna. I know they say that if there is a strong station it overloads the antenna but I found that the weak stations sounded stronger with the antenna disconnected rather than connected. After 3 hours of trying with the antenna I gave up because I was afraid that it would damage my radio.By the way I also have a Sangean radio and I tried the antenna on that and again it didn't improve the reception of the weak stations.Don't waste your money.
5,Good,Its got a good grip on the floor...I got it for my Mom who does yoga everyday and she absolutely Loves it...
4,good collection,"i have alot of respect for Jose Feliciano.his guitar tone is very special.i have heard him on countless projects and he really stands out.i dug Light my fire, but it's the theme to Chico&the Man that is my song by him.i still like that song."
2,Very Average,"It was very average album. It was a bit of a disappointment.Too many of the songs were ....""OLD JOSE"""
3,"Great for some, but not for me","I purchased this book because I find that my creativity has greatly decreased over the last 5-7 years. I am in my 30s and bought this book as I was hoping that it would help the creative juices flow again or at least provide some inspiration. It started off okay, but some of the exercises are just not for me - like curling up on a chair with a cup of tea and taking in your surroundings. I'm a busy woman and wanted exercises that would help me use my creativity in a more of a design/creation way and not just through thoughts. I didn't find what I was looking for in the first quarter of this book, so I gave the book away. The person that I gave it to thought it was fantastic and I have no doubt it will greatly benefit her. For me, the exercises were a bit too silly, but my friend who received the book thought they were great. So I would say that while this book was not for me, I'm sure others benefit greatly from it."
4,Worth a Year of Your Time,"Eric Maisel has given us a nice book filled with inspiration and creative guidance.This book is structured in 52 weekly segments starting with beginning work and ending up with a project that should be completed. Each short chapter contains a brief essay of guidance and then an inventive exercise to try on for size.The author of this book, Eric Maisel, Ph.D., is a psychologist who teaches that the act of creating impacts all aspects of one's life. So this book is intended for everyone, not just those struggling to survive artistic blocks. Executives can develop new business ideas, cooks can create better dishes, lawyers can find new ways to argue, politicians can consider alternative ways to create democracy, children can become better students and so on. Overall an extremely good book for those willing to put forth a bit of effort towards creating new ideas."
5,"Worth reading, doing, keeping, re-reading","Eric Maisel is a prolific writer with a penchant for helping artists. And this book is no exception. For those who have read Cameron's ""The Artist's Way,"" in the required number of weeks and wish there were other timed guides, Maisel's book is the answer. It's a year's worth of creative work, some gentle and imaginative, some kick-in-the-rear tough. I'll admit I read all the way through it, and I'll bet Maisel knew that most readers would. It's an interesting read that way, with Maisel's wry observations and self-deprecating humor serving as another level of inspiration. There is a lot hiding in this book, waiting to be discovered. The quotes in the scholar's margins create their own interesting commentary. Use this book to dip into when you are bored, stymied, frustrated, lonely or stuck. You won't come away feeling the same way. You might not want to do every exercise Maisel suggests, but imagining them might be enough to give you creative traction again."
5,Very helpful,"Eric Maisel understands that fear comes with unleashing our creativity. Gently prodding us in a day-by-day program, he shows us that we can get past our doubts to produce the work we're inspired to do and achieve creative success.His specific suggestions will help you get past your frozen moments that might otherwise turn into years.~~Joan Mazza, author of DREAMING YOUR REAL SELF and DREAM BACK YOUR LIFE"
1,Could have been written by a 13yo girl.,"Rather shallow and juvenile. I was looking for a peek into prehistoric culture by someone who had studied history and I got endless junior high school 'he said, she said' drivel. Even the animals were uninteresting and inaccurately portrayed.I cringed over most of the dialog and after the lead character uttered the phrase ""Hither and yon"" I slammed the book shut and took it back to the library."
4,Attractive dog dish at good height for lab...,"I bought this to replace a more table style raised dish holder that was getting damaged from water and was a pain to keep clean. I got the 3-quart size and the dishes seem *huge* to me. I'm going to keep it, but I would get the 2-quart if I had it to do over. The larger size is nice for water, but laughable for my 70-pound dog's usual food serving which barely covers the bottom of the dish. The wrought iron scrollwork is attractive, but I left off a star because one of the legs was a bit bent. I also think that this product should cost much less for what it is."
2,Not Worth The Price,"I originally wanted the Weathertech fitted hard type mats but they weren't available for my vehicle. This type was and considering companie's quality reputation I figured they'd be good. They aren't any better than what is available at your local discount auto store. When I contacted the vendor I bought them from and said I was dissatisfied, they said I could return them at my expense and then be charged a restocking fee. Considering the hassle and expense of returning them, I just decided to keep them. Very poor value. Save your money and buy generic mats. Felt like I wasted my money."
3,An ok bag for the price,"I bought these to use as tote bags for my bridemaids. Since one of my wedding colors was charcoal grey, this was a good fot color-wise. Overall, it was ok. The handles were shorter than I would have liked, and I didn't particularly like that they were black, but oh well. Overall, not bad for the price."
3,Neat book but quite old,"We used this book for a week's travel in Portugal. I picked this one because it was the only phrase book at the local bookstore, and I figured a phrase book would be more useful than a dictionary. It didn't quite work out that way. We found you really need a dictionary as well, because it's quite hard to find specific things in a phrase book. When you want to say ""chicken"", sometimes you just want to look up ""chicken"". This book in particular has some interesting organization because it's so old -- it was published over 20 years ago. Nothing about any modern technology like computers or cell phones, nothing about the euro, but a whole chapter about choosing meats at the butcher. The other failing is that there's no pronunciation guide. So it doesn't help you at all in saying place names, which are some of the hardest things in Portuguese."
2,not very useful,"The words in this book were very hard to locate, but not to worry, it did not have most of the words we really needed, anyway."
4,User Friendly Portuguese at Hand,I really enjoyed the Passport Books series in various languages. When I was travelling to Brazil often I would take my handy JUST ENOUGH PORTUGUESE and use it as my communications helper. Unlike a regular dictionary JUST ENOUGH teaches you popular phrases that you would actually use during your trip. Very helpful!
5,"I love this book so much, I keep buying copies for my friends","These blessings are beautifully presented, both through the words and calligraphy. They touch the heart, expressing the joy of gratitude and shared fellowship, without giving the sense of a religious treatise. Well done."
1,Too Expensive,I'm not rating the book a one just merely the price tag for this book. I'm a college student doing a paper regarding the implication of race in the NFL. To find out this book is $100 and his other book The slave side of Sunday is just ridiculous.You've gone on to write two great book that are important but yet people can't afford it. My college doesn't have this in the library catalog but if this was cheaper a lot more people would be able to read this and spark great discussion in college classes. Mr.Prior I'm disappointed that you've written great books but made them too expensive. Feel free to rebuttal if you want at s.rufus6656@student.leedsmet.ac.uk
3,From Back Cover,"VAMP... OR VIRGIN?Dr. Daniel Sawyers was undeniably drawn to the very woman he most disapproved of. But Lace McGee, a supposed expert on matters of love - physical love, that is - had shown him nothing but steely resistance. So Daniel asked the brazen beauty for lessons in the bedroom. Her bedroom. So what if he was already masterful at pleasing women - he'd fake it! For Daniel had to satisfy his overpowering desire to touch lace, to glimpse the depths of her soul, to know if uncertainty filled her gaze only to keep him at bay... or to protect a secret innocence.[First in the Sawyers Family series]"
3,Interesting features,"The carabiner clip on the end is interesting and could be useful, in case you need to hang this light from anything...It adds a bit of length to the flashlight. I wouldn't call it ""huge"" but it's not a ""mini-light"" if that's what you're looking forFeatures include:# Bright krypton bulb, easy to hold rubber grip with anti-roll bumpers and shock absorbing rubber head# Durable weather resistant design# Resists breakage even when droppedWhich made me think it would be useful to keep in my car trunk in case of emergencies..."
5,Split A Gut,As usual Lewis Black is funny if not funnier every time a new DVD hits the market - if you like to laugh this one tops most of his other hits - lots of laughs and lots of fun
5,I Got Screwed!!,"Lewis Black is the spokesman for the pissed off and can't take it anymore faction of this once great nation!Black's perspectives are so relevant and on point that you laugh until it hurts, realizing the whole time that we all are getting screwed!!"
3,good but hard to top his previous work,"Personally, I thought Lewis Black's ""Black on Broadway"" was quite a bit better but I'd put this one in at second place out of all of his multimedia work. He doesn't get as pissed off and exasperated in this one and sometimes even seems like the emotion is forced. I know it must be hard to get pissed off every show just to satisfy an audience so can't really complain about him, he has some great points....there's a good bit about how America is building a 700 mile long fence to keep the mexicans out but we can't even build the levies in New Orleans after the hurricane disaster....hehe....anyway, this DVD is good and is mostly new material sorta but if you don't have Black on Broadway, go for that one...or save that one as best for last..."
2,Left me cold,"Compared to Bill Maher, Lewis Black's delivery before an audience seems nervous and forced and therefore not humorous. He seemed angry to me and TRIED to be funny, but wasn't for me. I didn't finish watching this DVD, but returned to Bill Maher instead."
5,If you don't need the vocal score...,The Vocal Selections book is wonderful! It contains all the well-known songs for those of us who don't need an entire score. Plus it contains wonderful arrangements that can be used in a ton of different ways! I highly recommend this book!
1,Another disappointment for a WW2 buff from New Jersey,"This book again disappoints. Province idolizes Patton and tends to downplay his ability to moblize his army, effectively using Blitzkrieg tactics against the Germans themselves. Patton would likely agree that this was his destiny although he clearly did not enjoy losing his men, albeit honorably. However, Province has chosen to take advantage of the cult of personality around Patton as his web site allows you to join the Patton Society for sums of money which get you a 'rank'. I do not think General Georgie would approve."
1,Hard to be more disappointed than this,"This book is terrible; it is clear Province worships Patton. His objectivity is lost, and so too is the price of this book if you buy it. Read Farago or Blumenson to learn about Patton."
3,Excellent Quality but pricey,"Firstly, this is a very sturdy product. It took me 2.5 hrs to assemble including drilling and attaching the wood. As a time saver, I had the homecenter cut the wood for me. This brings me to the reason why I only gave it 3 stars. I knew the wood was not included, in a way that's good as it sure makes shipping cheaper. But add an additional $35 for a 4x8 sheet of 3/4 MDF, this brings the total to about $160 for this stand. For pieces of steel cut and drilled in China I feel it's a bit over priced."
4,Great Stand for the Price,"Assembly took a while. I think it probably took me 5-6 hours. My box fortunately didn't come open, so I had all the parts. After I attached the shelves, the stand felt very solid. A few parts were slightly bent. It's not anything you can't easily bend back, but they should really pad the box to avoid this. The instructions aren't amazing, but I didn't have any problems with them. Even though they say to use 3/4"" mdf for everything, I used 1/2"" mdf for the wings to decrease their weight a little. This stand is a great addition to my small garage shop since I can wheel it out of the way when needed."
3,Not very interesting,"I have to concur with the other reviewers. Indeed the book has wonderful pictures. But- for one thing- the Hui are not exactly an ethnic group- they are extremely diverse, live all over China, and range from committed Muslims to atheist cadres- so a study of the ""Hui folktales"" does not necessarily shed light on what it means to be Hui; these folktales are not part of a shared heritage. Perhaps if the scope was more specific, i.e. ""Folktales of the Hui of Ningxia,"" this would have worked better. Of course many of the stories are interesting- particularly those dealing with the intersection of Islam and traditional Chinese religion."
2,how can you make sure that the stories belong to Hui ?,i think that the stories in the book are not the stories of the Muslim people their own. this is because there is great distance between anthors and the culture of the people whom they wrote about. the people like Hui in China might not like to tell such stories that they collected in the book
4,Socialist Revolution,"I read this a year ago, but since Amazon still has no review of it, I'll give it a basic shot from memory.This is an in depth history of the anarchist movement in Spain from the late 1800's up to and through the Spanish Civil war, written by an anarchist who lived through the war (it is a history however, not a first hand account). Some of the discussion of the inner politics of the movement will probably go over the unnatentive reader's head, and a basic idea of the history of the civil war and it's main protagonists--before reading the book--will probably help one get more out of it. There are clear biases, some of the history can get tedious (but it's history, what are you going to do?), but overrall I highly reccommend it to anyone looking to get an in depth understanding of the period from an anarchist perspective.That's all I can remember. Enjoy."
2,poor,I have read many different books but this one evoked such feelings of dissonance within myself. This book had some good points. There was a good concept BUT the problem was the author could not deal with conflict properly. I felt less and less empathy for the heroine due to her poor decisions.
4,A Piece of Fluffy Fun,"Green Rider is a lot of fun, although the plot is a bit shallow.The story centers around a young lady named Karigan. She runs away from the university that she was attending, and finds a dying Green Rider. He makes her promise to carry the message to the king, and she complies. The story moves on from there, following her adventures.I thought the book was fairly good, although I would have liked to see a little more character development with the supporting characters. This book really is basically a one (maybe two character) book. Parts of the plot seemed very similar to some of Mercedes Lackey's plot devices. And, I didn't really like the way it ended. I rather hope that Kristen Britain writes a sequel to this book, exploring some of the other characters, and showing what Karigan decides.But, even beside all that, I recommend it as a fun, fluffy read."
5,AWESOMMMEE BOOK!!!!!!!!`,I totally LOVE this book! and I can't WAIT to read the sequelKristen Britain is really a gifted writer. I love the plot and everything in the story though I was a bit disappointed at the ending ( WARNING: SPOLER!) when Kari left for Corsa and I was wondering if she liked the king or Alton though I was hoping it would be Alton it seems to be the king but the story never said I quess thats what makes the waiting for the second one even more restless.
2,Cliched Rider,"Kristen Britain has lots of talent, and I expect great things from her in the future. That said, I cannot recommend her book to anyone who's read more than one other fantasy novel. While her writing style is great, the plot is just a long string of fantasy genre cliches. The setting is a land where magic was once powerful, but now the knowledge is lost. Naturally there's an Old Language no one can read. The protagonist, of course, rediscovers long lost magic and spends most of the book trekking down a road slaying monsters and trying to deny her destiny and go back to her old life. In amidst all the trekking and slaying she runs into the Ancient Powerful Evil antagonist and, exactly as one would expect, somehow manages to defeat him with her raw talent despite his 1000 years of experience with Ancient Powerful Evil Magic. Etc, etc, you get the point."
4,A charming first novel,"Some times a book simply strikes me fancy and I'm carried along completely entranced. When I first picked up the book I put it back down again thinking it was little more than candy coated, amateurish fluff. It might still be that but the second time I picked it up I found myself being quite happy that my flight was going to be delayed two hours so I was sure I could finish the book. Did Ms. Britain really do justice to the concept of the green riders? No. Did she indulge in some elements of trite plot elements, earning her the judgment of some reviewers that this book was targeted at the young adult market? Yes. Did I really care? Nope. While I would never claim that Ms. Britain even reaches Andre Norton's knees as a writer, I liked her straight forward storytelling and maybe a little bit of the innocence her story possessed. I have strong hopes that Ms. Britain might become a strong voice in fantasy in the future and I eagerly await her next novel."
4,Watch out for endings!,this book is extremely well written. The plot is exellent. I really enjoyed it. I could barely put it down! I rated this book only 4 stars b/c the ending was a bit ify.
5,An essential for any fantasy-reader...,"Kristen Britain is one of those rare authors that can pick up a pencil and write a story that is action-packed, vivid and enthralling. I could not put this book down, and read it straight through one day. I am now on my 6th time reading it, and am still picking up subtle twists that I missed the first time. Perfect for any fantasy reader, of any age. The characters were life-like, and the fact that they all had problems made them so realistic you just couldn't wait to meet them. The action was perfectly spread out to leave you begging for more, and yet it wasn't enough to cause an overload. I found myself laughing, crying and falling in love with the characters of the Green Rider, and recommend it to anyone who wants to do the same."
5,Extrodinary,"I loved this book!!! It was absolutly amazing. I was never shure of what the outcome would be. Always waiting to see what dangers would await Karrigan on the next page.I'm positive I was working up a sweat just reading it. I almost thought I was Karrigan taking F'ryan Coblebay's letter to the king and fighting off the strange creatures of Khamoran Vain myself. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about strange creatures that lurk in the dark, magical forces, or just wants to be amazed by the way the book twists and turns. I hope that anyone who reads this is book is just as excited as I was. P.S. The book was so good I'm reading it again and I also hope there is a second book to this novel."
5,thrilling Ride!,"Britain has written a thrilling ride from start to finish pitting a headstrong young heroine who must warn her king against a sinister conspiracy against him by natural and supernatural forces.This novel has memorable characters, chilling scenes of dark magic and nonstop action. I also like that this story is contained in one novel but the author can write other set in the same world.A refreshing change from ongoing series tradition in the fantasy genre."
4,Let the ride begin,"I was very pleased with this book. The author takes a nice approach with the development and background of the Heroine, and takes the traditional quest to a different level. Yes there is still THE person to beat and THE person to do so, but such has been the case since Sigfreid. At least this character, while unaware of the true nature of the quest thrust upon her, is not a completly and totally helpless innocent that needs his (as in most books) hand held for the first three books. I look forward to more offerings by this author and think a sequel could be new enough to not be a repeat, as in certain writers sequels."
3,A little too sweet.,"What attracted me to this book was the fact that I love horses and reading this book reminded me of my childhood. However, the deaths in the book seem to pass quickly and Kari lacks inner turmoil, which is fine, but Britain should introduce a character with a lot of inner turmoil. This book is a little too happy. I want her horse to die for dramatic purposes."
5,Loved it!,If you like a fantasy book with a little romance to juice it up then you have to read this book. You wont be able to put it down and when your supposed to be doing homework your going to be wanting to read.
3,A Mix of Lackey and Pierce,"This book, while very poorly edited, had its good moments. I was rather suprised by the extreme similarities between this book, early books by Tamara Pierce, and the Arrows trilogy by Mercedes Lackey. If you like their work, you will find The Green Rider entertaining. Next time I urge the editors to use spell and grammer check though. Then we wouldn't be stuck reading passages using the word ""now"" instead of ""no"" and the like. When I pay for a hardbound book I know I am gambling with the quality of the writer, but I should not have to be gambling with the quality of the spelling."
4,"NOT BAD AT ALL, FOR THE FIRST TIME OUT!","Not as meatie as I'd like but definately an enjoyable read. The door is wide open for what could be a great saga. Having read Jordan, Eddings and Kerr, it's very hard to find a series to meet my expectations. Green Rider has definately peeked my interest. Here's hoping Britain takes the charactors to their full potential in the sequal. Too often we're let down in the second and/or third books. I'm keeping my figures crossed."
2,Worst Heroine Ever,"I was barely able to force myself to finish this book. If I had to choose between reading this book and sitting in an empty windowless room staring at nothing for 12 hours, I would choose the book (but barely). I enjoyed this book very slightly but it wasn't anything special.The heroine had to keep getting rescued by completely random and poorly-prepared characters. She had to be saved 7 times through nothing of her own doing, it was pathetically funny. Everytime she got saved by someone else, I had to stop reading a distract myself from how random the rescue was.I did enjoy the basic plot though, so I gave this book 2 stars."
1,Happenstance,"I recommend this book only to pre-teens. It's not really bad - it would be an exciting read for a young girl. But it is being marketed as an adult book, and it is not. Many of the events are derivative of other youth classics - especially the Taran Wanderer/High King series of Lloyd Alexander and the Companions of Lackey. The plot moves only by strange things happening out of nowhere. Almost like the author said, ""Gee. My heroine is stuck. Let's have a kindy person help her out."" This happens at least 5 or 6 times - by the end of the novel I was bored stiff and not too impressed by the heroine."
1,What are people thinking?,"I bought this book with the hope that it would be a great fantasy novel. One that would go on my shelf beside some of the best books of all time. Boy, was I wrong. This book was given such praise and recognition and I can only ask, ""Why?"" I found it boring, unoriginal, forgettable and a comlete and utter mess. The plot was dull and the storyline was slow. There were parts in the book that were so insignificant and boring that I literally had to tell to myself, ""Keep reading, it will get better."" Wrong, again. It never improved! I only read it about two months ago and I can't even remember the main character or half of what happened. And believe me, I am a walking encyclipedia for books-good books! This book rightfuly deserves its one star. And a kick under the couch in my opinion. Save yourselves and read something where you don't have to strap the book to your face to keep your eyes on the page."
1,Beware the good reviews!,This is perhaps one of the worst fantasy books ever written and that's no small feat!The story is full of fantasy cliches and since the stories heroine and author are both involved in an undertaking in which they are ill equipped to handle the use of deus ex machina is used very liberally to rescue them both from the boring mess in which they find themselves.Skip if you are over 16 years of age or under but a kid with an IQ over 100
1,God Awful,"I would rather walk through hot coals while being forced to listen to John Tess sing, than read this book again. The writing is horrible. There is little to no characterization. And nothing really happens. Seriously, there is a ten page scene about the MC bedding down in a deserted waystation and nothing else.Please don't waste your money and time. There are so many _good_ books out there!"
3,it's pretty good,"A fair effort from a new writer. First, I'll tell you what I didn't enjoy - a plot/world that wasn't all that fresh and an ending that spiraled out of control. I thought the world and plot were stock fantasy and not all that original. The ending became suddenly metaphysical when most of the book stayed firmly in the realm of reality.I enjoyed the equality of men and women portrayed in this book, as well as the 'can-do' attitude exhibited by the heroine. The book is also a safe read for pre-teens with no inappropriate sexual asides.I also appreciated that the book began and ended within a single volume. Most fantasy writers would try to stretch this epic across a number of books."
5,Finally!!!,I looked at this book in the stores for almost 5 years and always passed it up. But I finally said I needed to give it a shot. Lately I have been avoiding female authors because they just do not put enough action into their novels. This one is definatly different. I read this book really fast and found myself getting up just a tad early in the morning to get in a few pages before heading to work. I felt that she did not rush the ending and pretty much tide things together nicely at the end. I finished this book Saturday morning and ordered the next one from Amazon Sunday afternoon. Get it. Read it. Enjoy it. This book is recommended for teens and older.
3,An impressive debut,"This promising debut has all the right ingredients: a well-paced plot, a likable heroine, and some surprising twists. After 100 pages, I found myself turning the pages almost faster than I could read them.What mars Britain's first novel, however, is her rather pedestrian writing style. (Writing a back-cover blurb comparing the author with Tolkien, Marion Zimmer Bradley simply embarrasses herself.) The number of sentences beginning with inert phrases (It was... It had... There would... This was...) is nearly deadening, especially in the opening descriptive passages. Nevertheless, as the action intensifies, Britain's writing style seems to mature (or perhaps I was too caught up in the story to be annoyed any longer).Readers of fantasy novels will undoubtedly enjoy this novel, in spite of its occasionally static prose. And I, for one, can't wait for the sequel."
4,Really Good,"I really liked this book, but I am sitting here WAITING for a sequal. All of my friends have read it and love it, but everyone thinks (and I agree) that it has a cliffhanger ending. There are a few unresolved things, and I REALLY WANT THE SEQUAL!!!!!"
5,Pageturner!,Sure it's the fantasy clich? but it's a very good one. It has all the calssic ingredients of a fantsy book and the realy strong point in this book it's the atmosphere. It has a warm feeling about it but it works well when it needs to get a bit more dark or serious. It's obvious to the reader that the wrighter loves to be outdoors and in the saddle.The story kept me intressted from the first page and i finnished it fast. It's easy to read not a seriously heavy book that keeps you thinking after you finnished it but it's not written that way. If you want a light fantasy with a great adventure this is the one for you.
4,Strong Debut Novel,"I think Kristen Britain did a great job with this novel. There were some predictable elements but overall a strong fantasy story. I was particularly enjoyed the fact Britain did not have Karigan find her one, true love in the story. That has gotten so old. The characters are strongly written and the writing action filled."
4,Very Horsey!,"Lots of great horsey detail, if you can't get into the saddle this will do for a while. Good story, well drawn characters. Lots of really nice forest imagery also. I loved it and got the next two in the series."
4,love those swords,"My nine year old loved this book. She especially loved that the lead character is female. There is one part where Kerigan,(The lead), is attacked by a man who wants to do bad things to her. I edited that as I read. Nothing untoward does happen to Karigan though because Kerigan triumphs again. She does that a lot. The story was filled with action. We loved it. -johnson"
4,Hooked on the series!,"I bought this series opener to listen to while driving to pick my son up from college for Christmas, and now I am hooked! I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this audiobook, from the story line to the reader, with a single slight exception. I found the main character's consistent denial of her obvious ""calling"" to be somewhat difficult to comprehend, and - therefore - not ""believable"". I suppose others might think it perfectly like Karigan to refuse to submit to another's will....even that of Destiny, but I found it rather irritatingly obtuse.That having been said, I still loved the book and have purchased the other three audiobooks in the series. In fact, I am considering buying the kindle ebook versions of them as well, so as to take advantage of the ""whispersync"" feature. Will let you know how the adventure progresses."
2,an OK first novel,"This wasn't that bad...it just wasn't that good either. As a first novel, the writing was better than average, but the plot and other story elements were nothing new. You will probably enjoy this book if you have not read that much fantasy; if you have, it will probably seem to drag on a bit. This should probably have been published as a YA paperback. You have to force your disbelief down with both hands to accept that teenage Karigan could have accomplished what she did. I think it is a shame that unpolished novels appear in hardcover while rare gems like Jane Lindskold's ""Changer"" only come out in paperback."
2,Not very good,"This book had an interesting premise, but the writing is not very good, and the characterizations are sort of flat. I fell victim to the Locus ads that praised this as the most acclaimed fantasy debut of the year. What nonsense. The offerings of both Juliet McKenna and Elizabeth Haydon were far more impressive and got better reviews. I will not read the sequel."
3,The Green Rider of Fantasy Cliches!,"This is a decent read with good pacing, the characters are somewhat two dimensional and there is liberal borrowing from Tolkein (don't they all!), Jordan and a little R.R. Martin tossed in for flavor (especially the wall bit). Although she is a decent writer and managed to get me to invest in the main character somewhat, there are some standard fantasy cliches at work throughout; Elves are more beautiful than people, a novice can get lucky vs a swordmaster with 20 yrs more experience with goodness in her heart and a little magical aid, etc. There also many blatant loose ends in character development and tangent plot lines paving the way for the inevitable sequels. It's worth picking up used or to while away some time waiting on the new Martin or Jordan."
3,Decent Read,"Personally I think the reviews this book gets are too high on the average. This is not to say that it is a bad book, but rather that I've read better and so it is difficult to justify giving it a 4 or 5 star rating.On the whole the story is good. As far as books go it has a good plot and the writing is easy to get into. The characters are easy enough to enjoy, though I found some a bit one dimensional.Honestly the only major complaint I had about the book was that the beginning seems to progress much too quickly. It feels rushed, as if it was compressed for editing concerns or perhaps the opening was rushed in order to get to the middle of the story more swiftly (which I found much better written and paced).On the whole I enjoyed it even if I did find the writing to be predictable at times. I won't call it the best book I've ever read, however I will say that it was at times difficult to put down and I felt compelled to read it through to the end."
3,Not bad,"You won't wastes your time reading this if you don't expect a startling new series but are just generally interested in the genre.There's a bit too many cliches, but all in all, it's not bad. The author presents a few interesting original ideas much as if a new, reasonably well read author is trying her hand at finding her own style.It will be interesting to see how she matures as a writer, and my feeling is that she will do well; had I thought otherwise, I would never have given it 3 stars, but I think it deserves that."
1,Amateurish and cliched,"I agree with the Amazon reviewer--this book is WAY over praised. It's not the worst I've ever read, but it is very rough and the writing clunks. The plot is not bad, and it is written in the same breathless style as Terry Goodkind's books, but without whatever it is the makes his stuff passable. Personally I prefer fantasy with more brain and less cliche [The Gray One, etc.] It would be nice to have a realism test when one buys a book--Marion Zimmer Bradley has crowned so many authors ""the new Tolkien"" and so many books ""classics"" that to me that is a sure sign that I will be disappointed. If it was more appropriately portrayed--""a good first offering by a new writer"" or something like that, it would not cause so much eye rolling later on. Ad departments, take note--you oversold this one by a LOT."
1,"Immensely disappointing, formulaic, waste of time and money.","While I admire the fact that Ms. Britain astually hammered out a complete novel, I am appalled at the amateurish, throw-away execution. Everything from the author's ""voice,"" to the dissonant dialogue, to the ugly sounds of most character and place names scream out that this book represents the nadir of fantasy writing in the modern age. Not everyone can be a Kay or Martin or Jordan, but it shocks me that this book was even published. I wish I could get my money back. Be warned."
1,not very substantial,"Let me get this straight- this book is not so much bad as extremely unoriginal. I agree with all the points of a previous reviewer. This book is ok but only if you dont mind reading regurtitated versions of a whole bunch of other good fantasy novels. This book is clique after clique- no new ground is made and neither the characters or the places were interesting for me to really care about. This book is really your run of the mill, average overcliqued shelf filler. I suggest you avoid this one- you're not missing out on very much and read so truly excellent fantasy such as Sarah Ash's Tears of Artamon series."
2,I can't believe I bought the HC.,"This was the very first time I'd bought the HC of an unknown, and new author. It will be the last time that I do so. This author may or may not turn out to be someone you want to spend your money on, but right now she's not worth it. I'm surprised that the book was even published, but given the poor editing job no one looked that closely at the manuscript any way. She had a pretty good idea but that's about it. Her writing is hackneyed and cliched, there are no surprises here, the bad guys are obviously bad and the good guys are obviously justified in their dislike of them. I can't believe that this is the start of a series, there's nothing that makes me want to continue to follow the characters into another novel. If you want to try some newer authors that did a better job right out of the gate, try JV Jones, or Elizabeth Hayden."
1,Tosh,This is a by the numbers fantasy written to a plot that has worked a hundred times. This time it didn't anybody who doen't know the complete story from the first page has never read a fantasy before.A complete waiste of time.
4,Great reading selection!,"This book was really good. In fact, it's one of my favorite still. It wasn't that complex or deep, but it had a good plot. The plot kept moving too. The book kept on bringing in new events that kept it interesting. The eas good, and it set itself up for a sequel rather nicely. I sincerely hope that Kristen Britain will writes another."
5,Could NOT put it down!!!,"I am an actor, and bought this book as some light reading to keep me awake backstage between scenes...I almost missed my cues!!! This is a great story that just goes and goes.......READ IT!!!"
4,Green Rider,"Simply put, I liked it. I found it enjoyable to follow the path of a messenger. Yes, it is somewhat sticking to the formula of underdog gets trust upon an adventure and them becomes the hero, but that is a tried and true formula.I definatly recommend this for persons who don't like to see too much violence or reading about how their favorite characters get killed needlessly, but do like a little suspense."
2,Disappointing Start,"Due to the numerous good reviews, I expected this book to be enjoyable. However, I found it quite difficult to finish the book. The main character, Karigan, was petulant and unlikeable. The Berry sisters were entertaining, yet they were only included in a small part at the beginning. The characterization of the antagonists felt incomplete because they were flat and one-dimensional. The villains were bad--because they were evil! There was hardly any other reason given for their actions.If someone would like to read a novel with dynamic characters, an unpredictable plot, and political intrigue, I would look elsewhere."
3,Pretty good,"This book is pretty good. It had its moments where i sat back and said ""Ummm that could have been a little better"" but overall it was good for a first novel."
4,So when's the sequel?,"Pretty good book. I think the next one will probably be even better. Oh, for a time machine, that I might travel into the future and read this and too many other sequels..."
4,Thought Provoking,"Paula Fredriksen's ""Jesus of Nazareth"" makes the reader pause to consider the reasoning behind Jesus' crucifixion. Christians believe Jesus had to die to serve as the ""ultimate sacrifice"", if you will, for the sins of mankind. However, Ms. Fredriksen causes the reader to ponder why crucifixion had to be the method of death, and more importantly, if Jesus was such a ""threat"" to Roman rule over Judea why weren't his disciples and follwers also executed. The book also examines when and how He came to be recognized as and called Jesus the Christ. This is not a book to be selected for ""leisurely reading"". It is definitely for someone who studies Christianity and realizes the importance of examining the history surrounding events when attemting to gain better insight into why certain events occurred in the manner in which they did."
3,Research Lacking Faith,"Paula Fredriksen's latest work provides a compelling look into the life and times of Jesus of Nazareth. The research is complete, detailed, and not lacking for specific theological information. However, there is a definite attempt in this book to seemingly strip away the most important and vital element of Christianity itself: FAITH. If one examines the life, ministry, death, and resurrection of Jesus without faith, it quickly becomes a fruitless effort. If, however, we preach Christ crucified and resurrected, we have the core of our Faith. Modern theological research has, for the last 30 years, sought to divorce faith from scriptural analysis, thus producing the quest for the ""Historical Jesus."" I believe this search is empty and not worthy of pursuit. However, it must be said that Paula Fredriksen presents a complete and worthy attempt to uncover this ""Jesus of history."" I am left only with one question: does Paula Fredriksen believe Jesus is just a man or the Christ?"
2,"much promised, little delivered","Publishers and readers must wonder whether yet another book on the Historical Jesus is justified. What's more, in the absence of new evidence, can be said about this topic? Fredriksen and her publisher promise much -- a new interpretation based on the fact that Jesus' disciples were not pursued by Roman authority. Yet her conclusions, that Jesus was made an example by a cynical Pontius Pilate and his Jewish collaborators, are as old as the Gospels themselves."
5,HAMMERHEAD one of the best Punk/HC-Bands ever to come from Germany,"Controverse, raw, angry and hard this record is a milestone for the German Punkscene. Gloryfying two Murderers that kidnapped and killed a young women during their prison escape and having lyrics that are full of hate for everything, this band was not for everyone. But Hammerhead managed to remain sympathetic, in every rant the connoisseur found bits of truth. No wonder that they achieved a legendary status. Loved and hated, ""Stay Where the Pepper Grows"" and the following white album are must haves for fans of pissed of punk/HC like Black Flag or Poison Idea."
4,Not all babies use a bottle!,"Overall, I really like this book. But, as a nursing Mom, I find it frustrating when so many baby books show babies asking for a bottle. In this one, it says, ""What does a hungry baby say?"" and you lift the flap to see a baby drinking from a bottle saying ""Ba-Ba."" That page didn't make sense to my son. Not that I expect to see a picture of a nursing baby, but I just think she could have shown a baby being spoon-fed and say something like, ""Num-num"". But, we still enjoy the book."
3,Ok book,"My son loves the lift-the-flap books, and the book itself is cute. The words in the book feature ""gaga"" and ""googoo"", so I didn't really like reading this to my son, as I was trying to teach him real words."
1,PAPER CUT!!! PARENTS BEWARE!!,"Usually I am a ""Happy Consumer""... NOT THIS TIME. My 13 month daughter loves flap books and loves to sit quietly and flip through books. This book left a DEEP paper cut on my child's thumb and blood all over book!!!!!!! Although she did not cry, I was horrified!!!!! Parents beware! Do yourself a favor and buy books that have the thicker pages/ flaps for this age group. Be sure to inspect books like this for sharp edges."
1,Extremely dissapointed,My daughter loves where is baby's belly button book so I thought she would enjoy this; but I was wrong. I am returning this book immediatley. We teach our 14 month old to speak correctly and this book promotes made up baby talk. I would highly discourage buying this book if your child is first learning to talk.
3,"You'll love it, if you use baby-talk with your child.","I love Karen Katz books (Where's Baby's Belly Button? Daddy and Me, Where's Baby's Mommy, Counting Kisses). This one has the same great pictures and durable format as the books we love. However, all the words under the flaps are in baby-talk (goo goo, boo boo, ba ba, night night etc). Since we never talk to our baby using those words, this book is a disappointment for us."
1,Flaps rip too easily!,"Though the illustrations are cute and the content is fine, these othersized and lightweight flaps rip VERY easily. We've not even had them 1 month and the book is in poor condition from regular use that other flap books do fine. Cannot recommend this one! We are very disappointed."
4,"Cute book, too ""baby-ish"" for my 1 year old","I bought several of the books in this series and all were great, however this one was too baby-ish for my one-year old who is learning new words everyday...this books seems to reenforce baby-talk with ""ba-ba"" for bottle and goo-goo... this might be good for a 6-9month old."
4,My toddler loves it,"She's had it for over a month, and loves to have it read to her again and again. After having it read to her the first dozen or so times, she anticipates what we find when we lift some of the flaps, and loves hearing that she's right. Nice little book."
3,It's Just OK,"I love Karen Katz's other books but was a bit disappointed with this one. I'm not a big fan of teaching baby talk so I find this book to be of little value. ""What does the busy baby say? Uh-oh."" Other than the large print, my baby does not find this particular book as interesting as the other ones. WHERE IS BABY'S MOMMY? is a lot better than this one."
2,Unhappy customer---Missing book !,"The boxed set was supposed to have four books in it. I triple counted and read the outside of the package. The set is supposed to have ""Where is Baby's Mommy"", ""Daddy and Me"", ""Grandma and Me"" and ""Grandpa and me"". The ""grandma and me"" book is no where to be found. So much for a set!"
3,what does baby say,The story is appropriate for under 3 years. One word for a sound of emotion. Not very entertaining even for children.
3,What Does Baby Say?,"Cute book, but not as sturdy as it looks. The flaps rip off the pages fairly easily. I would stick with board books."
3,Watch good but band is a problem,"I bought this watch for my brother-in-law. According to him, the watch itself is very good. He likes the diameter of the face - not too big. He is small-framed (5'6"") and says his hand cannot accomadate a large watch. But there is a problem with the expansion watch-band. Since most men have hairs on their arms (right down to the wrist), he says that the band pinches the hairs. He also has a seiko and timex that both have expansion bands. With the seiko and timex, when the outside strips are closed, the inside ones (resting directly on the wrist)are slightly apart. So, those hairs are not pinched. But with this Bulova watch expansion band, when the outside strips are closed, the underside strips are forced closely together, pinching the hairs on the hand. It is quite uncomfortable. He says he will have to change the watch band.Bulova needs to correct this. I wonder how they are not aware of this problem."
2,A good second source,"I read these book, worked every exercise and even supplemented this with training from the [...] and it wasn't enough to get to exam passing level. I ended up using the Microsoft Press book which was much more accutate to the actual exam, and provided more real world exercises that I run into now."
4,"Great book, and not only for passing the exams!","The book is well structured and organized. Topics are introduced in a easy-to-understand fashion and they are explained and broken down step by step so the reader can easily understand.The Q&A; section after each chapter really test your knowledge on each chapter and not the mention the bonus exams questions and flash cards on the CD, which will put you in exam mode - you still need additional Q&A; materials though.Overall, I can't complain, this book will serve you well in preparing for the 70-284 exam.Of course you should use other cross-ref materials (text, video etc.) for enhancement, clarification, etc. It's also good to have a primary 'video reference' (such as CB* N*gg*ts or T*stO*T to use side by side with this book."
4,Great album,"I agree with all of our Renbourn cronies below, this is a great album. It was always my favorite of his when I was a kid, too. I just didn't give it 5 stars because I like to reserve some space for something better."
3,TORCH SONG TRIUMPH,"Second album from this Belgian combo who are into stylish eclecticism. A compilation of 12 acoustically arranged songs, the album sports a potpourri of musical styles with no filler tracks. There's Stax soul in What's A Woman, a touch of jazz in Travelling light, and a smattering of Piaf in the French chanson Quand Elle Rit ... As interpreters, the band successfully employ influences as varied as South American rhythms, Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin and even the Stray Cats. Lead singer Dani Klein's distinctive voice is the main attraction."
5,"Best ""Unknown"" release ever","If you are looking for something a little different, definitely off the beaten path, this CD is a great way to start. Since Vaya Con Dios is European, many in the US have never had the opportunity to experience their unexpectedly uplifting, and yet completely captivating style of jazz/blues swing. Salted liberally with smokin' horns, Dani Klein's uniquely talented vocals, and great material, this CD flat rocks, and brings with it a very satisfying taste of something at least once removed from the usual musical fare found on radio these days...sample the cut title cut ""Night Owls"" if you like your swing a little on the hard side, or ""What's A Woman"" for a real lowdown wailin' blues lament. Like the old commerical used to say ""Try it - you'll like it!"". Highly recommended."
4,Interesting Perspectives on Bonding and Attachment,"As a child psychologist who often works for child welfare agencies, I have to testify in court on issues on bonding and attachment quite frequently. This book didn't tell me much I didn't already know about bonding in humans. It did, however, expand on the concept, to bring a more universal understanding of the process in most species. Parents will find themselves a little glossy-eyed trying to get through this one. Practitioners might find it interesting, but from a practical standpoint, there are better options.Christopher Alexander (Author, 'Diagnosis, Assessment, and Treatment of Foster and Adopted Children, 2009)."
3,Air Force Monopoly,"it's an okay product, all the pieces were there, but the box was torn in a few spots and crushed in."
3,loopy boots,"Not a ""great"" boot but acceptable for the discounted price I paid. Only the uppers are leather, the rest of the boot is ""man-made"" materials. The leather loop at the rear of the boots causes pants to hang up on the loop when you stand up. You can just cut this flush or it cost me $4 to have the shoe repair guy open the seams and resew them with the loop down inside."
1,wish it were for real,"Ordered this boot for $37--great deal on a great boot! Pity it didn't exist. Seems that ""in stock"" does not mean that Amazon actually has it. 5 stars for Rockport, 1 for Amazon."
5,Beautiful and Comfortable,"I ordered this for my grandma's 94th birthday last month. She LOVES it! She said it is beautiful, soft, light yet warm, and easy to zip up - IMPORTANT because of her tight hands. She's an amazing 94 year old. She gardens every day, juices, cooks, cleans her house and has a small dog and cat. She's an active lady and this house coat/robe fits her lifestyle perfectly. And it's colors and pattern are very cheery. She thanked me many times for it."
3,Women's Plisse robe short,I like this robe especially the color but I had to replace the zipper after one month. It was a very cheap zipper and kept pulling apart. I wouldn't recommend this product and wouldn't order from this company again.
5,Leisure life short plisse robe,I'm short so it is a long robe on me and that is what I wanted. I like robes that have zippers and sleeves and this one is just great. Very lightweight - just right for summer.
5,Even a city slicker will enjoy this book!,"This is a huge, gorgeous book for the money. In addition to information about every tractor in America, the machines are presented in large, beautiful, color photos. The way the author tells it, the history of the tractor plays a big part in the history of this country, and it makes for good reading even if you are not a tractor enthusiast."
1,Excellent Book for a Third Grader,"This text is terrible. Half of each chapter is nothing but law review articles exploring various debates. The other half of the chapter is a news story version of a case with no decision, followed by a hefty slathering of often random MPC provisions. The space devoted to actually filling the student in on the meat of criminal law varies from nothing to five pages. I will grant that it is enjoyable to read, only because its all fluff and you're done and on to contracts in a half hour. Do yourself a favor and buy Dressler's Understanding Criminal Law if you are required to use Robinson's Text"
1,Is this series accurate ?,"A good rule of thumb to apply to any show you see on the Discovery or History Channels that has the Christian (especially the Catholic) religion as it's topic is that it is going to be inaccurate, sensationalistic, and condescending. They especially like to show an increased number of these programs around Christmas and Easter, all the better to destroy the faith of the gullible and un-informed. Better to avoid them like the plague they are.[...]"
4,One of the best,"I have seen a lot of videos about the life of Jesus. This series is the best I have seen for helping the viewer understand how people lived during the time of Jesus. The quality is excellent and the acting is believable. This one would be my first pick.My second pick would be a DVD titled Close to Jesus. That is an excellent DVD for helping the viewer understand the relationship Jesus probably had between three of his closest followers and apostles, with a wonderful treatment of his relationship with Mary Magdalene. And her place in the group of followers.My third pick would be a DVD titled Visual Bible: Matthew. That video seemed to focus more on scripture from the book of Matthew. It is the story of Jesus as told by Matthew. Recreation of sermon on the mount is very good."
3,Not what was expected,I was expecting a documentary providing some insight on the late President and general information about President McKinley. I was disappointed because this is a series of old film footage put on a DVD but no narration. I feel this product would have been much better if there was some narration added to the very old footage. Although the film footage is well done (remember this footage was taken in the 1890s-1901). If I had known exactly what the product was I would not have bought it.
4,Engaging read,"The nature of an autobiography is the intensity of emotion in telling one's own story. You will not miss that in this book. It is the autobiography of an adult written for adults, so the word choice and content in places reflect that. I did let my daughter (10) use it for a project-- but I preread entire sections and post-it noted paragraphs for her to use.All in all, she is a facinating woman with a story of colliding cultures, competing lives, and a passion for life."
5,Great,HOA will charge me a lot of money for a new remote control....why should I pay more for something I can for way less online. I got 2 of these remote controls and I'm happy with them.
1,Not an effective product,I purchased 5 of these items to replace a lost garage door opener in a condo building. They would not work 95% of the time. I would have to get out of my car and walk up to the receiver before the door would respond ---sometimes it would not work at all. All of the openers would act similarly. I'm not pleased.
4,"Great, cool, storage case for DVDs","This thing is so cool and useful. It's stackable so if you're adding more and more DVDs to your collection you can just buy another case and slide in another one! The only negative thing is it doesn't hold odd-sized/ double DVD cases. Be careful about stacking too many though, it will sway if you bump into it."
4,Made it easy to log my dives,This item arrived when promised and after a little initial frustration interfaced with my MAC and I was up and logging my dives directly from my computer.
5,Worth the Import,"This is an incredibly sophisticated album, and explores much more territory than Becoming X. All the tracks are solid through to the end though my favourites are the first four. Like most good music, Splinter takes a while to get used to, but it is definitely worth persevering with this one. I would call it 'rocktronica' and place it somewhere between Massive Attack, Placebo and Radiohead, but this is unfair as it is very special and unique in its own right. I don't buy many CDs but I didn't have to think hard about paying the import for Splinter."
3,Great songs... what happened to the vocals?,"I don't know what to think. I am a big fan of 'Becoming X'. 'Splinter' is full of really good songs, but I really think the guy sounds like a victimized cry baby. Yes I know he wrote all the lyrics for ""Becoming X"", and I know that he is the musical genious behind the Sneaker Pimps, but his voice just doesn't do it for me. Can't they just get the girl back? I will probably listen to this CD from time to time because I'm sure I will one day learn to like it. Everybody else does.... right?"
4,Stinker Pimps?,"After the departure of Kelli Dayton, most Sneaker Pimps fans were hesitant on giving ""Splinter"" a go. The transition from Dayton to Chris Corner seemed to have compromised the bands style and for most fans, this was unforgivable. However, I listened to ""Splinter"" before ""Becoming X"" and had less of that bias. After listening to Sneaker Pimps for some years now I can honestly say that this album isn't as dreadful as some people make it out to be. If anything Corner's haunting vocals and riffs help the band get back to its trip hop roots and actually do so in dramatic fashion. ""Splinter"" as a whole is good (not great) and for a few fleeting moments, the album can lift you off your feet."
5,The Best CD I Own,"At first i thought that the band made a big mistake by getting rid of their female vocalist. I gave it a listen, and was not very impressed. On a whim i bought the album which is now by far the best album that i own. Every song on the album is good, no great. However, if i had to pick my favorites they would have to be Half-Life, Low Five, and Destroying Angel."
5,love this one and 'bloodsport',"I wasn't around during the whole 'Becoming X' era.. luckily (but hey, that's just MY opinion). I can't speak for anyone else. Thanks to the Sneaker Pimps for dumping that kelli dayton chic. She probably had her own agenda when she was in the band.. wanted to control everything, total bs. Or maybe it was just clashing musical tastes, whatever happened, it happened for the best because they are SO MUCH better. I'm in love w/Chris's voice!!!!!"
3,Not as good as the other disks,"Putting aside the old vs new Sneaker pimps debate (I like Becoming-X as much as Bloodsport, but for different reasons) this is the one to miss.. It just does not do it for me, to dark and depressing when compared to the others."
3,Get the picture!!??,"I am very surprized that a label re-released that album on cd, this is far from being a classic, I didn't even know it came out of the Benelux.This review is based on the LP Heavy metal ears, so only half of the cd.Picture is a dutch band and I bought this album a long time ago when all you could find in record stores was IRON MAIDEN, SAXON AC/DC or TRUST-those were the happy days!Picture is one of those bands that never really made it to a higher level, and when you listen to that album the first thing that comes to your mind is ""I hope they're better at soccer than they are at heavy metal!"".Still it's not a bad album, most of the songs really rock-some are traditional NWOBHM others more bluesy.It's probably the production and the lack of experience that makes it sound weaker than it actually is.I believe SAXON has done worse...but also much better.For NWOBHM fans only."
4,A real practical TQM book,"This book has provided a very practical TQM framework, both for the concepts and the implementation. The book very well describes how to adopt and practise the Customer Focus concept, a component of TQM, by using well explained standard steps and real world examples. The best thing about this book, however, is that it has been written with the very common English so that it is not too difficult to understand by those using English as their second language."
2,Deceptive advertising,"Wanted RJ11 plug (ala Radio Shack's original); received RJ45 plug. Not a biggie, but extra work on my part!"
5,Spice Girls.Spice World,"Spice Girls are great group!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Spice World is great album!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If I have mistakes,I am sorry.I am ukrainian V.Khmelenko"
5,Its the greatest,Its the bomb . you will luve this album . You can't forget about it.BUY IT!!!!!!! NOW!!!!!!It is the top hits
4,:>,"A fun yet cheesy soundtrack to a fun yet cheesy movie...it's actually quite good, and the bonus track has that same campy sense of fun. I bought this one a long time ago and my general taste in music has since changed, but it's somthing to enjoy on the second level. It's got some good and catchy tunes!;^) better than alot of throwaway pop."
5,"Spice World, by the Spice Girls best album of the 90's","Spice World the new album out by the pop group the Spice Girls is hand down one of the best cd's of the 90's. With songs like ""Stop"",""Spice Up Your Life"", ""Viva Forever"", and ""Too Much."" You just can't lose with Las Chicas Picantas. (Spice Girls)Melanie Janine Brown,Victoria Caroline Adams,Melanie Jayne Chisholm, Emma Lee Bunton. PLUS Spice World includes Ex-Spice Girl, Gerildine ""Geri"" Estelle Halliwell. BUY IT NOW!!! :) Also BUY Spice the first CD and the new single form the Spice Girls, ""Goodbye""."
5,Trailer Park Boys,This is a great Trailer Park Boys movie!! There is fun to be had by all who watch this movie! An excellent continuation of the series!
1,Not So Funny...,"I just finished watching this. Rented it because I really enjoyed the TRAILER PARK BOYS - THE MOVIE released sometime ago and was pleased to see this ""sequel"" on the shelf.Unfortunately, this one brought ZERO laughs to me. It's just not all that funny. If watching a drunk and a rapper are your thing, this is your kind of movie. Otherwise, stand clear of this one.The DVD is loaded with extras including over 30 minutes of deleted scenes and an alternate ending. There are several featurettes on the disc as well.The boys themselves are entertaining (especially Bubbles), but overall, save your money unless you're a real Trailer Park Boy's fan and want this one for your collection."
5,If you are crazy for the TPB you will love it,"This is for TPB fans. If you watch it with someone who is unfamiliar with the show, they won't get some of the things that are going on and you'll have to explain it to them. Since you want to enjoy the movie, just put them on Netflix and have them watch the first 10 episodes of TPB while you're watching the Countdown movie.After they watch the first 10 episodes, they will either ""get it"" or they just might be one of those weirdohs who doesn't like the TPB. If they are, there's nothing you can do to help them.However, YOU can still love this movie, and you will."
5,Non Stop Entertainment,"What can I say. I'm in love with Ricky, Julian, Bubbles and the entire gang at Sunnyvale Trailer Park. This collection has it all, entire series, the Christmas special, Countdown to Liquor Day and Trailor Park Boys, The Movie. Non stop entertainment that you need to watch more than once to get all the jokes and Rickyisms. It's the best!"
4,The only difference between them and you is a coupla drinks.,"The tag line prety much sums it up, and like the funniest of jokes, it is so true. Ok so most of us have'nt robbed a bank, but you've thought about it have'nt you?The boys are back, out of jail and wasting no time in resuming thier criminal careers. They quickly come up against a sober Jim Lahey and a home in shambles.Always the entrepeneur, Julian comes up with a plan to put them on easy street, and the hijinks ensue. You have to admire thier tenacity at avioding ""real"" jobs.Missing in action are the faithfull scapegoats Corey and Trevor, and the star cameo's from the previous film.A fun ride, from the people who put ""real"" in reality TV."
2,"okay, at best",dont bother with this movie unless u r a HARD CORE fan. it is BORING & not the usual funny.
2,The final hoorah - not so loud,"Mike Clattenburg has continually set the bar higher and higher, but was finally unable to trump a previous TPB season/movie. The plot seemed entertaining in the beginning, but it never picked up momentum - it seemed sluggish. An overall disappointment - unfortunately."
2,Grown in communist China!,"Skip eating questionable food from China and demand USA grown food. You can get garlic grown in the USA at your farmer's market. You can also get it from farmers online and distributors such as: spicesinc.com. Or you can search under ""garlic not grown in China"" like I did. It does exist.Please join me in encouraging Amazon to get an organic source of garlic that is not from China; they currently have none. Let's help our own economy and not buy food from communist China."
4,Lovely face cream,"This is the first time I've ordered beauty products on line. The face cream is delicate, has a delightful scent, is not greasy, keeps my skin soft. Don't get it in your eyes as it will burn. I haven't used it long enough to know if it softens my wrinkles but I will continue using it regardless."
5,E B 5 cream,"first time purchase from amazon.Product arrived in good condition.Have used E B 5 Cream for a long time, and can't get it localy any moor."
1,Buyer Beware -- potential Toxic Ingredients,"The positive reviews of this cream seduced me to try it, but I would have liked to have seen the ingredients. Upon receipt of this cream, I saw the ingredients included triethanolamine (TEA) and methyl- and propyl-parabens, easily investigated on the web by Googling the names. These ingredients have been identified in research as potential carcinogens. The TEA mimics estrogen, and thus, may also be a teratogen and mess up developing (embryonic) systems. Furthermore, mineral oil is one of the major ingredients of this rather expensive cream. So, back it goes! Mothers and grandmothers may have thought well of this cream, but they did not have the science then as we do now. I feel that the manufacturer's lack of disclosing the ingredients on the website is an attempt to deceive unaware buyers."
2,Tried this one prior to Neutrogena....not happy about it..,"Eb5 cost a lot more and I did not see any difference in my skin. In fact I thought this cream was very heavy on my face and did not absorb into my skin very well. So it goes into the wasteland of creams on my nightstand and under my counter and chalk it up as a wasted $35 on my part.After reading all the five star reviews (many of which is their only review on Amazon) you would believe that this is the next miracle cream. My original review stands, it does nothing for my skin besides moisturize, I have seen no difference in wrinkles. If you are just looking for a moisturizer then be my guest and buy this product. If you want an effective wrinkle reducer, then keep looking."
1,"Sticky, slimey new formula","I have used this cream for 20 years but they have done something to the formula. The jar I opened yesterday was slimey and sticky on my face. I don't know why companies take a quality product and try to cut costs. I tried to contact Eb5 in regards to this, but they will not return my calls. I have bought my last jar, there are other good creams out there I'm sure."
2,"It's alright, not for faces though.","Used the cream, had a fairly extensive acne breakout after using the product for two weeks. It's a cream, and it can probably serve as a lotion cream, but not for faces. The 5 star ratings are ridiculous on this, and most have only reviewed one product...this one. After reading another buyer's comments, this seems to be a marketing ploy on reviews.....Wish I had known than before I shelled out 35 bucks. I'd move on to Olay or other known brands...There is no miracle wrinkle cream."
3,Gave this moisturizer to my husband,I read several great reviews about this moisturizer on Amazon so I ordered it too. And... I like to support local businesses but I'm not sure this is my favorite moisturizer. We will probably use it for hand cream or in the RV as a back up. I can't really say anything bad about it but it doesn't make me excited about using it either.
2,eB5 Face cream,"tHE JAR OF Eb5 IS A MUDDY GREY, HAVE USED THIS CREAM FOR 20 YEARS AND IT SHOULD BE A PEARL WHITE. PLEASE CANCEL THE OTHER 2 JARS i HAVE ALREADY ORDERED. barbdyell@gmail,com"
2,Not impressed,I did research before ordering eb5. It did not work as it stated it would.I have used it for 4 weeks and have not seen any improvements to my skin. Not good for the price paid.
1,This is not good for me.,"After 6 weeks use this product, my face dark spot and wrinkles get more.I'm so disappointed it. Back to the Loreal."
2,Just another cream,"I have been using this cream for about 2 weeks now and haven't noticed a big difference in this creams results compared to the usual vitamin E cream I use. Most of the great reviews are from people that work for this company. As they say, you can get a person's money once. Well they got mine but never again."
1,Skin reaction,"I have only been using this product for 3 days until I start seeing a rash develop all over my face. Pretty much Eczema. I've never had this problem before. I suggest people who start using this to apply it to a small surface of your skin for a few days to confirm whether you would get a reaction or not. Otherwise, from my experience, I am never using this product again."
3,Not Sure About This Product...,"Got this product more than 6 mo ~ a year ago because of the high ratings. On first application it feels smooth and silky on the top layer. But after a few minutes, my skin under the cream feels dry and tight. This cream sits on top of my face, not really moisturizing it deep down.I tried the cream this long before posting it's because I want to give it a fair review.Other moisturizers such as Shiseido really absorb into my skin and leaves my face watery dew moist, not tight and stiff like the eb5 facial cream.Shiseido moisturizers works really well, but it is expensive. So, I'm going to try other brands from Walgreens or CVS. I will alternate the use between them. Experts say generally, they all have the same ingredients, more of less...Also, I've read a review, after buying eb5, saying that the company ask their employees to give a high review on this product as an incentive. Not too good."
4,eb5 facial cream review,"I'm a 23 year old male and didn't really read what this was suppposed to be used for. I have sensitive facial skin so I chose not to waste the money and try it anyway. I have been using eb5 for about three weeks as directed and it seems to have worked out great. My face is softer, cleaner, and clearer also."
4,Never disappointed,"My mother (age 87) has been using the product since it first appeared on the market. To see her skin would make you wonder her actual age. The product does not remove wrinkles or promise anything but delivers beautiful skin. Soft, silky and clear, beautiful skin. The product is never greasy and absorbs into the skin almost immediately which makes it great as a night cream. I just started using it myself after trying too many other products and was favorably impressed with the quick results. I am very happy with the results. My skin has never looked so good."
2,skin irritant for me,Would return but cut the box apart. Seemed to cause skin irritation.Will try again in a few days to see if was an isolated incident.
2,EB5 Facial Cream - Too Soon To Tell Any Difference...,I've only been using the product for 3 weeks. Feels greasy when first applying. No difference on my facial lines yet...
2,OLD!,I have been using eb5 for 20 or more years and love it! my husband uses it also but we were very upset when what we received this last time was old. I hate that I can't depend on getting a fresh new jar of eb5 from ya'll!!!
3,using it for the first time,"my aunt use eb5 a lot and then she told me to try it out and for the first time i bought it online, so far the results are good...i have a very dry skin so this cream doesnt leave it dry and moisturize my skin well, which is good thing about it....."
5,eb5 Facial Cream,"eb5 has been a trusted Facial Cream since mid 1980 for me. When JC PENNEY discontinued the product I was in a panic. It made my day when I found it on amazone.com.I would appriciated if I could get notifications when the cream goes on sale.Thank you,Marianne Robinson"
4,this is a very good product at a good price,I really like this product although it isn't a miracle worker it absorbs into my skin and softens fine lines and wrinkles as well as some of the more expensive creams.
5,Wonderful product,I have used EB 5 face cream for many years and have found it to be the best anti aging cream around. I am allergic to many scents and have found this unscented product easy to use. Thank you for a wonderful product.
4,good gifts,they seem to be great. shoes for my wife was just what she wanted.I also hope she like the face cream anf it works I hope.
5,LOVE IT!,I have put this product on auto repeat! This is a great cream. A little goes a long way-but it DOES NOT feel heavy on your face! I have very dry skin and have layered this cream on-and to my very thankful surprise I have not gotten one breakout! It is not oily at all and I even wear it in the day under my face powder. Cant say enough great things!!!!
3,"Brilliant writing, but...","There is much to like about this book. The first 100 pages are as good as anything I've read in the past few years. Flanagan has some surprises up his sleeve and there are interesting episodes throughout.And yet I found myself getting bored towards the end. The last half of the book feels extremely repetitious. This isn't helped by the fact that there is a mutilation or disembowelment every three pages. I'm not squeamish, but these horrific scenes tend to loose their effect when they are piled on so lavishly.It's a shame that ""Gould's Book of Fish"" looses steam just when it needs to grab the reader by the collar (or should I say ""by the gills""?)"
4,Sanity? Insanity? All very wet in either case.,"I read very little fiction (as you can tell from my other reviews) so when my daughter bought me this while abroad I stuck it in the queue and eventually got around to it. Glad I did.The book conjures up Borges, Marquez, Melville, yes, and I might also add Heller and maybe even Rushdie. This is a compelling if extremely gross read. Surreal and horrific, it is a book within a book and a piscine view of humanity, or maybe the other way around.I can't add much to what the other reviewers have said. I'll give it four stars because I suspect it is not for everyone, but if two or three of the above-mentioned are writers you cherish, then Gould's Book of Fish is worth your time."
2,Difficult to understand,"I admit it: I bought this book for its beautiful cover. But when I started reading I found the contents to be quite tough.Gould's Book of Fish tells the story of Billy Gould, a convicted criminal in the penal colony Sarah Island in Tasmania. He is quite a decent painter and therefore is allowed to paint fish for the doctor instead of doing tough manual labour. Billy Gould tells the story of life in the penal colony: the megalomanic commander, the scientifically obsessed doctor, the sadistic guard and in particular the enormous sufferings that the prisoners have to go through and the way in which the white people treat the indigenous population.This is not a book for the fainthearted and the impression the book left on me was that the main character becomes more and more crazy as the book progresses. At the end I had completely lost track, but maybe this is a book that should be read in one go as opposed to the several days it took me to finish it."
1,Pretentious and Tedious,"I'm reading this book for one of my book clubs and am about 70 pages in so far. It's been a dreadful experience thus far and I'm thoroughly discouraged by the other reviews I've read here that loved the first 100 pages and thought it got boring after that. If I wasn't reading it for a club, I would have put it down long ago and I never do that.Flanagan just rambles along, perhaps trying to get the reader to understand the state of mind of the obviously insane narrator, but I find it merely tedious. I am not a fan of writers who are more interested in style than story. That is not to say a novel has to be written in a straightforward manner, but it should not be complicated just for the sake of being complicated. Read ""Naked Lunch"" by William S. Burroughs if you feel the need to read a complex, convoluted book in which the use of an awkward style complements the story.I will be surprised if anyone in my book club actually finishes this horrid book."
1,Don't buy the hype,"If you like historical revisionism, especially the finger-wagging politically correct kind, shoved down your throat in the form of second-rate magic realism, this book is for you. A good start, a few laughs, and then the book goes off the rails to establish that, gosh darn it, history is a lie made up by baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad white folks."
5,Perservere and Be Rewarded,"Reading the reviews below, this book seems to gather either 1 star or 5 star ratings.If you like books written in a literal style with a linear plot development and a neat happy ending, this book is not for you.If you like to be immersed in a mulitlayered story written imaginatively with a spellbinding last quarter, this is for you.Like most works of literature, this will reward (and most likely demand) repeated reading.Yes it is tough going in parts (probably even more so for non-Australians), but it is worth perservering, you will be rewarded. Hopefully like me, after reading the last page, you will close the book, and be amazed."
5,"Better than the London Cast, for sure!","I have both the London Cast and the Broadway Cast. One thing is certain.. if you are to hear it first time, then buy the Broadway cast. Ony after that you should consider getting the London Cast!This is THE Fiddler On the Roof! Go for Mostel, not Topol."
4,Fiddler as Good in '09 as in '64,"The music has run through my head since I saw ""Fiddler"" in 64, and two other times in community theaters. When my grandson landed a role in an acting camp production, I wanted him to hear the original. The kids did a great job, but no one can stir the emotions and the imagination as well as Zero and his crew. The words are poignant, the presentation is superlative and the repretroir is entertaining. The disc remains in my car player, and I often dream of what I would do ""If I Were a Rich Man!"""
4,A classic by any other name would not be so memorable,"Ok, I'll admit, Fiddler on the Roof is not modern day listening. It's old and out of date, but it is nonetheless a classic. People don't buy this CD for the feeling of a 90's hit Broadway musical, such as RENT or AIDA; they buy it for the sheer warmth that classical give off. The songs are catchy in the way that Oldies are. Who could resist singing along to ""Matchmaker"" or humming to ""If I Was a Rich Man""? This CD is worthy of praise for being one of the most memorable, classic musicals of all time. I can practically gaurantee that any real musical enthousiast would love this score."
5,Fun,"This show is full of great music. Tradition is one of my Broadway favorites. And who can't be moved by Sunrise, Sunset? The play itself is rich with Jewish tradition and characters."
2,A good Fiddle,"The Broadway cast recording is fine, but if you really want to get a sense of Tevye, his character, personality and warmth, purchases the London recording with Topol--it and he are magnificent. And vocally (both spoken and singing) Topal if FAR superior to Zero Mostel."
3,the Fiddler is falling of The Roof!,"This paticlar recording of Fiddler is a very mediocre one. Zero Mostel was probably very good at acting the role of Tevye, but he couldn't really do much more than,well,bark the songs out.Apparently Tevye's daughters inherited his unique singing talents, as proven in Matchmaker,but they don't send you writhing in pain or make your ears bleed or send every dog within a 5 mile radius charging at you. Perchik was good, and golde was Ok, but I probably would either;1, save your money and don't buy it;2,buy another version ( the movie one is good)"
2,Poor quality control,"This item was hooked up & played without problems for about five minutes.It then stopped working altogether, had to be taken apart and a loose screwtightened in order for it to work.For such a large & reputable company I believe the quality of this itemis disappointing"
3,Not so impressive,"I don't like its crossover from low to high end as it produces these treble overshoots, which are annoying to the ear especially when combined with overdrive/distortion pedals. The low end just disappear in the mix, a better design would have kept the level of volume more or less the same on the low end as well...Also because this is an SMD PCB (very tiny resistors/transistors/caps) if you want to mod this wha pedal any request for Dunlop to provide electronic scheme for mods, will not be answered, and I could not find mods for this F rev on the web"
1,Premature death of a hedgehog,"Got the hedgehog today. It was a junior size for my male shi poo. Within hours the nose was broken and stuffing was coming out. This thing was supposed to be practically indestructible. Very, very disappointed."
3,Not for Super Chewers,"I've had trouble finding a toy that will hold up to my dog's chewing. My sister told me that this was the greatest toy ever. Her dog carries it around with him and he's been chewing on it for months.I couldn't wait to get it in the mail. It was so cute when I took it out of the box that I took a photo of it. I gave it to Thor (100 lbs, 17 months old) and within 10 minutes one foot was ripped off. Five minutes later a leg was off. Within an hour and a half he had destroyed it and was walking around honking the ""grunter"" that was in the body of the poor hedgehog. It took him another 10 minutes to kill that.Less than two hours to achieve complete destruction. Bummer."
1,"Not sturdy enough for a Lab, alas","This hedgehog is very cute and my dog loved it at first sight. Unfortunately, she had a seam open not many bites later, strewing stuffing around the room and pulling out the plastic noisemaker to crunch on (until I got it away from her). She had a supermarket hedgehog that lasted months; it looked just like this one, so I had high hopes. But I cannot recommend the toy if you have a dog who is a strong chewer."
3,Hedgehog,"My dogs love it, but wife keeps sawing back up. The dogs love it, but play rough. Made the mistake of ordering xlarge fist based on revues, but was too large. This is a good size. My dogs are 30 and 60 lbs. I buy 2 at a time"
4,Dogs Love it.,"Both my 15 lb Westie and 55lb Mutt love this toy. We have gone through 4-5 of them over time. Ellie, the mutt, rips them apart very easily, while Coconut just likes to carry him around and squeak him."
3,OK - did not last long,OK for price.My med-size dog had it apart in 30 minutes.Completly unstuffed in 1 day
2,30 Minutes,"30 Minutes is all it took for my dog to rip this thing open. It's a cute toy that makes multiple noises and you can tell that was particularly incensing to the dog and made him love to chew on it even more. But seriously, 30 minutes is all it took before I had to throw the thing out. I have an English Bulldog and he has very strong jaws, so if you have an animal that loves to chew and is strong don't buy this toy. It will not stand up to it. May be fine for a Chihuahua."
1,Not for extreme chewers,"The description of this toy was a bit misleading; it's listed as a large toy, but it's actually quite small. My 56-lb Great Pyrenees mix had it completely ripped apart in less than one hour. I would definitely not recommend this for dogs that are heavy chewers (or for any larger size dog). Cute toy, though!"
1,Was not a large,My husband opened and gave to dog before I saw it when I did was very disappointed item was not a large I have ordered over 6 of these and this was a medium too bad I could not send it back
4,Homer Squeaks but has no rattle!,I bought Holly Hedgehog so why not get Homer also for my friend's little dog! He just loves hedgehog toys the best! Homer is well made and the dog is very happy with the toy. I only give 4 out of 5 stars because the toy only squeaks and there is NO rattle in this toy! I had to buy from Petco to find a Hedgehog that grunts/rattles and squeaks!
3,HUGE!,I hadn't paid attention to how large this thing is. My golden retrievers ignored it. Every once in awhile one might sit on it. It makes great noise but it is probably too large unless you have one of the giant breeds.
5,Extra Large Hedgehog,Our lab loves this hedgehog. Labs like to carry things in their mouth and the more the better. She can't carry anything else when she has this in her mouth although she will still try. It has a loud grunter that she will squeak all over the house. Would recommend for larger dogs.
2,Weider Quality Lacking,"Weider products in general are good products. The basic 'you get what you pay for'. So when I ordered the EZ Spin-Lock Tricep Bar I expected fair quality. Instead the tricep bar I received had an end bar welded on crooked, and an overall spotty chrome finish. Welds were sharp to the touch. Due to poor quality and construction, the product was returned to Amazon. On Amazon's part, their service was the best!"
5,Excellent for the price,"For the price you get good T-pipes. If I had to do it over, I would have gotten the 1-inch ones, because these are a bit small for my betta to get through, but he shouldn't have a problem. They work great for hiding spots for betta's. I am hoping they will do well for my betta fry that I am hatching to hide in."
1,Confusing compound of disparate texts,"If the process industry really is consulted by stuff like this, then it is a wonder that process automation serves to enhance productivity. This confusing conglomerate of disparate accounts is likely to be understood only by the authors themselves."
4,Comprehensive Planning and Scheduling Technologies,"I was mainly interested in refinery planning and scheduling technologies. I found the book to be a useful and comprehensive discussion of the various technologies in the planning and scheduling areas. In the latter chapters, the book discusses how the various functions may be intergrated.I found the information about the EPLP (Extreme Point) LP modeling to be very useful. Although this is not widely used today, there are a number of useful applications for this technology for global refinery modeling and planninng."
2,Didnt get it ... not for me,I actually love these kinds of books but this one fell far short for me. One pager layout which I like but the over arching theme seems to be 'do nothing' and have a quiet mind. My college age daughter likes these kinds as well and walked away with a similar feeling. For us anyway there was no substance here that was actionable. Looks great but no cigar.
2,Best Real Little Fake Book Ever,"The printing in this book was too small to be of value to me. I returned it and bought the full sized book. In a public setting with dim lighting, where I'd likely be using it, it would be almost impossible to read. The full sized book is much more readable, but the selections it contains are not as useful to me as those in my other two fake books,the ""Ultimate"" fake book and my ""Standards"" fake book."
4,Be careful - miniature version,"I like the music in this book and ordered it without realizing this is the miniature version. (That is what the words ""Real Little"" in the title mean.) I had to return it because the notes were too small for me. I am older and have to take off my glasses to read, but I still had trouble see where the notes were. There is a full size version that I have borrowed that works great."
4,Most songs are ones I know,"some great doo-wap, nostalgic 60's & 70's, some Frank sinatra, Elton Johns' best. Streisand!! Elvis songs Wonderful old sing-a-longs the Beatles Neil Diamond and so much more. it's worth much more than this price. Another thing is you get all the lyrics!!!!!!!"
3,Linear Algebra Solutions Manual,"The idea of a Solutions manual is to give solutions for the problems in the book. However, this manual is the exact same thing as what I have in the back of my book. The even numbers aren't included, and no additional explanation is included, I'm disappointed and wasted 40 dollars."
1,not worth,in my opinion it is very small and very expensive.it has no solutions for exercises for revision.i bought it but it was not efficient and convenient
1,Don't waste your money!,Most student solution manuals have extra information that is very valuable. This book on the other hand appears to have the same solutions as the text book so if you have the text book you don't need this one!
2,Partial solutions,"This book only includes solutions to the even problems. These answers are given in the back of the book already. Also, some solutions are lacking or incomplete."
5,"Masterful, cutting edge Sci-Fi. A Must buy.","Concerning both ""Beyond the Veil of Stars"" and ""Beneath The Gated Sky"", Mr. Reed is one of the better ""new"" sci-fi writers in the field... if you like original ideas, exploration themes, shape-shifter plots, or that ""high lonesome"" feeling of old Bradbury novels, this might be for you.Reed's 2 related novels in this series will make you ~think~, and perhaps dream, of alternate realities. I have re-read both books numerous times since. They are quite original, and devastatingly believable.Please Mr. Reed, write a third book in this series!"
3,MORE THAN I EXPECTED,"Found this CD in a thrift shop for pennies. Because I'd heard that this was not too good, I didn't think what I paid for it was too bad for what I was getting. Well, my wife and I laughed for 45 minutes on our way to church at the humor of this artist. We could hear where others have gotten some of their inspiration as well. A couple of things were ""borrowed"" from other sources, obviously, but her delivery of them added a flavor that was Sister Cantaloupe."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this based bits and pieces placed on our local radio station here on some of her other materials. I also bought it because it was almost sold out and I thought I was going to miss out on something. there were some funny parts, but basically slow and not too good. I probably will not purchase any more of her videos."
2,Just ok.,She wasn't funny throughout the show. She had some hit and miss funny spots. I watched it twice. It was no funnier the second time around.
5,Essential collection of a great American poet,"W. C. Williams's poems are about as important to modern American poetry as the Rocky Mountains are to the American contintent: you can't get around them. As the reviews here indicate, he's still not to everyone's taste, but his influence is enormous, largely defining great areas of subsequent American verse (most of which however in my opinion isn't nearly as good as Williams himself.) If you are at all seriously interested in modern American poetry, you should have this collection in your library."
3,Poetry Insanity,"I bought this volume and volume 2. Carlos William Carlos was definitely ahead of his time. But I can say except for The Red Wheelbarrow and a few other poems, that he was a radical. I can't say I'm a big fan. Some of the poems were awful the others were just wierd!"
1,"Save your money for the double disc, concept album.",First let me say I gave it 1 star because I could not give it none. It's most unfortunate that so much was lost from the original concept. The London cast recording is far more superior than this.
1,A Poor Rendition of the Original,I fail to understand why this sickly version succeeded on Broadway where the wonderful original British version failed. I would love to ask the authors why they felt pressured to change a good thing. The mighty dollar must rule. Stick to the original British version. It has the heart and soul that this version totally lacks.
3,CHESS THE AMERICAN VERSION,"Not as good as the English production, but stilla good show. Not enough ""bite"" to this version. I'll be working on a production ofCHESS in Las Vegas in 2006. Teri"
2,Sanitize version,"I have the original English version and love it. When I returned to the US I found this version and purchased. What a disappointment. The original story had intrigue, romance, betrayal, and conflict. This version had everything that might have offended the Soviet Union taken out. When the script writers were done, there was no story left. Just watched ""Chess in Concert"" on a DVD. It was superb!"
2,A poor remake of the original London production!,"As a great fan of the original London production, I was quite eager to see and hear the Broadway rendition. I was greatly disappointed! By comparison this one is pathetic and lacks the genuine emotion and intellect of the London show. Perhaps if I was not familiar with the original version I might have enjoyed this one."
3,Chess musical,"Chess is the musical Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus of ABBA wrote with Tim Rice after the disbanding of ABBA. The music is superb. The lytics are witty. Chess was a big hit in London's West End in the mid-1980s. It was a different story when the show moved to Broadway in 1988. The critics hated it. Chess closed almost as quickly as it had opened. Why? For one reason, the soundtrack was of nowhere near the quality of the London/Stockholm recording. New characters were added, and the song sequence was moved around. Furthermore, in the 1980s, America was in a patriotic mood and unwilling to accept a show which portrayed a Russian as a good guy and an American as a bad guy. Chess toured in 1990 and did well on the road. I saw it in Louisville, Kentucky."
1,really?,The title does not match the photo or part of the description. I bought another brand: I don't need a 16 inch hose.
3,Dull but useful,"This book was required for a neighborhoods and politics class. Very dull in tone, this book is an important case study on the development of civic institutions and civic engagement in Italy. I was able to read the book in a couple of days, but found myself losing attention."
2,Some cool parts,"Just couldn't make the cut. Ending was not the best. It had some good parts. Funny in many ways, but missing something."
3,Eat Cheese,Not a great movie. They suck you in with the Sarah Silverman name but she's hardly in it and the movie had a terrible plot. Was a middle of the road movie...wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Have already given it to the library for a donation.
2,How can anyone possibly rate this higher?,"I love Sarah Silvermans comedy, but I am not about to rate this any higher then two just because she is in this. It's a dull and boring story of a fat guy who loses his girlfriend and realizes he just wants love. All while he has boring conversations with his mother, his friend and whatnot. He is a struggling actor and loses his job... along the way he meets a pretty girl in an ice cream shop who sleeps with him and and another woman who likes some album he liked.Thats the whole damn plot... it sounds as boring as it really is. I think I laughed, or should say, kinda lightly chuckles maybe 2 or 3 times during the whole movie. And the ending of the whole thing is just terrible. It's a movie that is aiming at some kind of ""comedians showing they have a heart"" but fails to bring somewhat of an interesting story to this drawn out snore fest of nothingness."
3,Bizarre movie with unsatisfactory ending,"The physical quality of the product was fine; however the movie itself was uncommonly bizarre, with a completely unsatisfying ending - not just in comparison to mainstream movies, but even to independent movie standards. The movie on the whole would be at least marginally worthwhile if not for the abrupt ending that makes the picture appear like the production team just ran out of money. I can't say I would recommend the picture."
4,"A gentle, unpretentious vignette","A reminder that unhappy, lost or lonely people can live without anger or despair, I want someone to eat cheese with is an unpretentious, flighty film. Do not expect fast action or even resolution. Just sit back and experience gentle humor and a respite from overly dramatic relationship movies."
1,"waste of time, preview exceeds movie!","I could not even finish watching this. It was dry, slow moving, and pointless. I watched for 50 minutes thinking that it would get better, no such luck. I turned it off and watched broadcast TV instead. The previews made me want to watch this. I was extremely disappointed."
1,Life Sucking,This movie starts off slow and you think it might get better but it never does it felt like the movie just suck the life out of me. Comedy it is NOT you end up feeling sorry and depressed after the movie. If you want to feel sorry and depressed this is your movie.
2,Not a fan,I like the cast of this film and thought I would love the movie. 4 of us were watching this and about 20 minutes in someone spoke up and we all agreed that it was terrible and turned it off.
2,Had to return the book,"If you order this book order the 1950""s edition.The print of the neweredition looks as if it was poorly photocopied and put haphazardly intopage foremat. The print was so small and blurry you would need a magnifierto read it. I sent it back and ordered the 50's edition.Charles"
4,Sound,"My laptop soundcard is on the fritz and it'd take 3 weeks to ship it off for repair. USB-powered speakers to the rescue.The sound is good to great. Words are clear and distict; music is, too. For the price they do well. However, these are small speakers and don't have much volume. Figure on a radius of 7-10 feet. You can hear it much farther away; but volume suffers.I enjoy their portability; they fit right in my laptop case."
4,great little speaker set,"Got these to toss in my laptop bag for travel and presentations. Good sound, nice and compact, effective cord storage, and it's nice to not have to worry about batteries."
5,"Small, lightweight, and great volume!","My laptop speakers on my Thinkpad were low volume even when put at the highest level. This Verbatim lightweight USB speaker (which actually has two small speakers, although I don't get a stereo effect from them since this item is small and they're close together), pumps up the volume! It's loud even at a low level. Definitely a good product, and I think you'd only get a stereo effect with two separate speakers that are far apart from one another."
2,Audiofiles Stay Away,"Well... you'll at least hear your music. Tinny sound, no bass or real dimension in music quality. Easy plug and play... love that. Retractable USB cord... like that. Nice, collapsable cell phone like unit... like that. Do I use it. Nope. Am I sorry I bought it. Yep. Not great quality of sound. How 'bout pretty poor sound quality. As I said... Audiofiles stay away."
3,OK Little Speakers,"These are very handy -- small and easy to store. I bought them to use with my laptop because my laptop speakers are poor quality and very low volume. Well, these can play quite loudly, but the quality is no better than my laptop's -- maybe not even as good. They are fine for what they are but don't except good quality sound. This may just be as good as speakers this size can sound."
5,Verbatum Portable USB Speakers,These speakers solved an audio malfunction with my laptop. They are convient and put out much better sound quality than the original laptop speakers.
2,Maybe it was written under Mercury Rx,"There is such a depth of information that could be said about this routine retrograde period of Mercury. 3 times a year it visits us and there is so much misunderstanding surrounding it. This book simply adds to that. Not a lot of meat. More information about when it will happen. I was disappointed. I found nothing new in it, and an emphasis that missed much of the inherent repsect due a mercury retrograde. I'll keep looking, because this one won't stay on my shelf."
3,Not one of his best....,"Now, I am a huge Keillor fan. I laughed myself hoarse over ... ""Casey Strikes Out"" and once climbed over twelve rows of seats in order to get his autograph on my dogeared copy of ""Lake Wobegon Days.""But I've got to say, this wasn't up to his usual standard of excellence. Sorry, Mr. Keillor. I really wanted to like it. But the ""magic"" was missing."
1,Grapics and Web Page Design not up to Lemay's standards,"Graphics and Web Page Design is one of the most worthless books on any computer related subject I have ever picked up, yes this includes any of the original software manuals from Lotus or MicroSoft.This book doesn't teach you much about the web or graphics or about web page design.all I learned from this book was not to buy any more books written by Laura Lemay or published by Sams Net.The cd is worse than useless, with out of date shareware"
2,did not work as advertised,"Perhaps mine was defective, which is in itself a problem, but I thought the point of a compression gauge was to HOLD the highest reading as the strokes occur, and then you can release it when done. Well mine never held, they flipped back to zero after every stroke, and this made it really hard to read. I fiddled with everything that came with it, read the instructions completely, and no luck. very disappointed."
1,Junk!,"Works as advertised, repeatable measurements, and comes well equipped.No complaints.-----------------------------The above was my initial review. I used the tool for the second time yesterday, and it got stuck in the spark plug hole; the hose would simply spin on the threaded bit - I had to get creative to extract it, but I finally got it out. The knurled surface on the bit does not have enough grip on the rubber hose, and it spins when you try to un-screw it from the spark plug hole. I even tried crimping it harder to no avail.Serves me right for buying cheap tools."
5,Very Happy,"Very pleased with this product. It seems well made and came with clear and helpful instructions. The full set of adapters will come in handy. When assembled for use everything feels solid, well sealed and leak free. In one use thus far, it has functioned very well and helped diagnose exactly what I bought it to do."
5,Compression Gage,Works great. Has adapters I may not use for a while but nice for when I do. Wish it included a rubber-tipped straight extention for quick checks on 4 valve engines with long reach to the plug holes.
4,Nice tester,Seems like a good quality compression tester with all the fittings you should need. Would be nice to have a storage case instead of just a pouch. Found it later at my local auto parts store for the same price.
1,Quality automotive tools,"Decent tool. As more vehicles use overhead cams, the adapters that thread into the spark plug hole must extend outward far enough to grasp. This tool's adapters are short and WHEN (not IF) the adapter gets stuck in the head, removal becomes very difficult and time consuming."
1,dont buy!,"The hose is poorly crimped and pulled apart inside my spark plug hole. It took me a long time to get it out, especially since i have a boxer engine. Im not the only person this has happened to either. If you are unable to get the fitting out once it breaks, you might end up having to pull off your head or drill it out. I consider myself lucky. The product also feels cheap, and im not sure that the readings are accurate. I took this back and bought the Craftsman set for 65 bucks. MUCH BETTER THAN THE ACTRON, and well worth the extra 25 dollars."
1,Compression Tester,"I am quite dissatisfied with the quality of product. The Compression Tester being used for the fourth time in a deep spark plug cavity, would not thread out. The hose crimp at threaded end would not hold and had to pull hose off of threaded insert of Tester. I was able to remove other end with long nose needle nose pliers. I was fortunate to be able to get insert out and made for a tense moment. Now can I find a small clamp to reattach hose and allow access to deep plug cavities."
1,"Cheap, Very Cheap Not for Flathead motors!!!","EDIT: Customer service for this company was NULL. They simply ignored me for a week and then after persistence they finally told me they would not replace the 2.50 cent fitting! That is pretty bad.I was not impressed as soon as I opened the package with quality. The fittings feel like the cheapest things you can make. The gauge seems ok for the money and the hose feels alright, but the fittings are junk. I had to destroy the fitting and the threads on my head to get one of them out which was a very expensive endeavor. Another note is DO NOT thread this into a flathead motor, they will fit the threads but are to deep and will hit the piston...I KNOW THIS. All together I would say as usual when you buy something cheap you get something cheap. Look for a nice professional gauge set if your a professional shop, these are not worth the frustration and will not last at all."
1,Disappointed,"Thought tester read a little low, so I compared it to a few friends compression testers. This one consistently reads 20lbs. lower"
4,Works great,Great timing light for the money. Easy to see timing marks even during daylight. Cheap light I had prior to this could only be used at night. Adjustable advacne seems to be acurate.
4,Great tool for the price,Timing light is easy to setup and use. Not the fancy digital one but works great especially if your vehicle only has the TDC mark. Purchasing from Amazon was smooth as always.
1,"Excellent content, but ...",Picture and sound quality leave much to be desired. For sixteen dollars I would expect a sharp picture and excellent sound. This dvd looked and sounded more like a bargain basement disk.
3,Not as good as hoped,"The story is still worthy but the acting and production qualities are not as good hoped. No fault of theirs, but the age of this makes it a last generation production quality."
3,Like the story but...,Unfortunately this looks like a VHS transferred over to DVD. I wanted to show this in my church but the quality just isn't good enough. Color is washed out And audio isn't very goodp
4,"Sunday School teachers, take a look at this.","Children today do not realize the price paid to give the English the Bible in their own language.The story of Tyndale is one that should be shown to them. This is not a large scale, Hollywood rendering, is simply done, well acted and lasts about 2 hrs. I would use it from 5th grade (in three sessions with discussion) and all the way up to adult."
4,"Better than ""The Radicals""",This was a pretty good movie. The history was right on target. It always helps to watch a movie about a true story. This will forever help me visualize the history.
3,"Informative, but overacted","This tells the account of a remarkable man. I was not pleased with the lead actor. The emotional level was not varied enough to make his performance as good as it could have been. The supporting cast was better and they make the film as good as it is. The direction was good, and the scenes of translation of the Bible into English are very well done"
4,god's outlaw,The problem with this movie is simple.This man was such an important man to God's work that the makers should have not cut corners in the telling. Too much left out! I would still recommend it to anyone who doesn't know the story behind the English bible.
4,CD storage,"For it's size, the capacity is excellent. The only complaint I have is that removing and replacing the cd's is a bit difficult(they do not slide in or out easily)."
5,Terrific recording,"It is slow. It is idiosyncratic. It is also very beautiful. I agree with the other reveiwer's high opinion of the finale. Celibidache keeps the tempo slow, the brass quiet, the fiddlers playing sul ponticello allowing the listener to hear the terrible beauty of that incessant two-note violin figure as it builds to the finale. It is easy to wallow in the bombast of this piece but let this recording open your ears to all the details."
4,UNCLEAR ON THE CONCEPT;,"I searched the net for a model Wright Flyer to hang in my home.Yours seemed to be the right price and style.I was really disappointed to find that it is a kite. It doesn't have the detail I was looking for, either.All was not lost.I sent it to my teen-aged grandson for his birthday. His dad is a Senior Pilot for a major airline and his mom just retired from the Air Force. I know the whole family will enjoy it."
1,I didn't finish the story...,"I found Enchantment pretentious. The story or characters seemed coming out of nowhere and I found them hard to related to. I listened to the audiotape version while I was spending two hours in traffic daily. However, I found myself rather stare at the road than listening to the story. I didn't finish the tapes because I didn't care what happen to these characters. The Enchantment was my second romance novel. Prior to the Enchantment, I started my first audiotape romance with Diana Gabaldon's Outlander. Its historical setting, characters, and logical conversation really fascinated and touched me. I listened to them over and over again."
4,Useful for clarifying our thoughts,"A good (though not great) work which once again shows that good thinking in the economics realm is more important than good mathematics. Krugman can enlighten everyone from the lay person to the academic economist on the way to apply theory to the world. A great example of why intervention still happens and works. As is well known, the work of guys like Lucas is little help in the real world, and Krugman shows how to bridge the gap. Only four stars, though, because you can tell he wrote it in a hurry."
5,Lucid and enlightening discussion of economics.,"Economics for the non-professional. The only other economics book I can recall that was so lucid is an oldie oldie, Castaways of Plenty: A Parable of Our Times, by Willard E. Hawkins, published in 1935."
5,"Accessable, relevant rethinking of international economics","Paul Krugman analyzes the recent messes in the world economy in a very insightful way. His discussion is very accessable. Surprisingly, he is both sensible and well connected the current disciplinary discussion within economics -- an unusual combination.This book points out both enormous risks and very feasible ways to protect ourselves from these risks. As Krugman notes, his recommendations belie the usual character of economics as ""the dismal science"" because they don't necessarily cause any significant pain for the countries that adopt them. However, we do face a very real risk that the reigning ideology of free trade and free markets will interfere with the use of these solutions at critical points"
2,The content of the book is OK but not suprising!,"This is one of many books that Krugman has written for many years.Although,it is a good book,but the issues has a long gone.What he suggested on overcoming Asian Crises is not a new thougt.But for people who interested on Keynesian type of analysis,this book can be added as your reference.Have an enjoyable reading."
1,Krugman wrong again,"Just as the return of depression economics is announced, the economies in question are all booming again! Perhaps it marks a return from the return of depression economics. The book isn't even entertaining; I could take him being wrong if he showed even an ounce of humility. His style is insufferable!"
1,Brilliant Nonsense,"This book is an example of what happens when high intelligence is mixed with blind emotion and ideology. Krugman is a political hack with ""an ax to grind"" against market capitalism. He offers no valid statistical analysis to support his wild theory that government spending and regulation can save the U.S. economy. All past experience shows, unequivocally, the opposite to be true. In fact, Krugman is waging a war on reality, rejecting financial facts and human nature. Government intervention harms economies and leads to stagnation and costly bureaucracy that grows uncontrollably like a cancer, until the ""patient"" dies."
1,Will He Give Back The Money To Defrauded Enron Investors?,"Krugman served on the advisory board at Enron in 1999 during the Clinton Administration. During that period, Enron was getting many Ex Im bank loans rubber stamped. Enron became a regular on the Ron Brown Commerce Department flights to drum up business overseas. The flights were obviously a pay for play deal. During this period, Enron was also shoveling $3 billion or more into the Dabhol power plant in India. Enron owned 65% of the plant but it became a black hole and was one of the straws that finally broke Enron's back.If we are headed towards a depression as Mr. Krugman opines then it may have a lot to due with corrupt crony capitalism and fraud. Mr. Krugman should have given us more information on what he actually did at Enron. He wrote a lot of articles about the Enron fraud but he always left out how he was on an advisory board at the company."
5,An excellent treatise on the nature of economic crises,This book gives the reader the basic mechanism and the various causes of econimic crises in a very facile way.I was excited by the approach of Krugman and by the challenges that Krugman appointed to the reader (and not only ...) on the field of macroeconomics and monetary policies (always supplemented by a political comment...).A basic economic background is needed by the reader in order to fully understand the essence of the various crises treated within this book.I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested on economic crises of the contemporary world .
5,Krugman Earns His Nobel Standing!,"This book was recommended to me by another Nobel Prize winner in economics (Jim Buchanan)! It earns its standing with clear, understandable explanations of the way the U.S. economy is supposed to work, and how it fails when it doesn't work! Not as good as Buchanan, but close!"
4,Suprise!,"If you are from eastern Idaho or Montana you should read this book. I passed the memorial many times & always wonder just what happen down in that mine. The research is fantastic, alittle hard keeping everyone straight,but worth it in the end. I was sad about the end, these men never had a chance. All miners are at the mercy of the ""Big Man"" in the front office! God bless them all & their families."
5,Greg is the best,Greg told me about this book and wanted me to buy it so I did & as usual it was great. I have all of his books so I had to buy this one and I am so glad It did. It is wonderful.
5,Excellent Book!,"It's as hard to write good nonfiction as it is hard to convey the context of underground mining to outsiders. That the author succeeds on both levels is a testiment to the quality of this book. The descriptions of the miners and their lives seems to be right on target. The book is hard to put down as the fire progresses, the only thing I would add is some better maps/drawings/diagrams."
5,Engrossing writing,As a miner this book drew me in right from the beginning. The description of the underground world was vivid.
3,cd,it was good but it was a replacement for one that was no good. But the price was good and it got her pretty fast
2,Like all the other portable radios - cheap,"We use these radios for backing our RV into our driveway, so they are not used very frequently - maybe four to six times a year for 5 minutes each time. We had previously bought several sets of two way radios made by different manufacturers over the years which never held up. Seems always one of the two would crap out. So I decided instead of buying theel-cheepo's, I would spend a little more and get something that I thought might hold up. Wrong. These Motorola's didn't hold up any better than the cheaper ones. Seems to me that two way radios that are used as infrequently as ours are, should last more than a year."
4,Be careful WRONG LABELLING,"THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT. I TRIED IT ON AT THE TEST COUNTER AT MY HAIRSTORE, GOT HOME, AND GOT COMPLIMENTS ON HOW MY SKIN WAS GLOWING. HOWEVER, BE CAREFUL, I ORDERED ONLINE OFF AMAZON.COM AND I USUALLY WEAR A MEDIUM/LIGHT BUT THE COLOUR I RECEIVED ALTHOUGH LABELED MEDIUM/LIGHT IT WAS LIKE MEDIUM/DEEP OR DARE I SAY DARKER THAN THAT.OTHER CUSTOMERS HAVE BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT THE CHANGE IN THE LABELING OR A HUGE MANUFACTURING MISTAKE. THE COMPANY HAS SAID IT IS A MANUFACTURING MISTAKE..HMM, WELL I WONT BE BUYING ANY ONLINE UNTIL IT IS SOLVED AND I DONT SUGGEST ANY OF YOU BUY EITHER UNLESS YOU WRITE THE COMPANY AND FIND OUT IF THE SITUATION IS FIXED.FYI I BOUGHT IT OFF AMAZON AND THE LABELING WAS MIXED MATCH; HOWEVER, THERE ARE OTHER SITES POSNER SELLS AND PPL ON THOSE SITES ALSO HAVE WRITTEN REVIEWS SAYING THE COLOURS R NOT THE SAME WAS THEY ALWAYS WEAR. JUST TO LET YOU ALL KNOW.TAKE CARE"
5,"Hersey's Hot Cocoa, Goodnight Kisses 4-count boxes","Great product, difficult to find retail. Price was acceptable....similar to what I would pay retail, when I can find it."
2,for sensitive eyes??,"the product makes my eyes burn.. so i dont think it is for sensitive eyes..it removes eye makeup, however in contact to your eyes, it burns and my eyes got redish"
5,Awesome and hydrating,"Much better than Neutrogena oil-free. This lasts FOREVER too! I've already had it for a year, and it's not even near finished."
2,What's the big deal?!,I am so disappointed with this make-up remover. I have tried letting it sit on my eyes for several minutes and still I cannot get anything loose (and I don't wear that much makeup). I use it to take my make-up off before a shower and end up having to scrub- and the simple shower water does a better job moving my make-up around and I have raccoon eyes when I get out of the shower. Then i have to scrub my face again with this stuff for a while before having a clean face. Not worth it. I like that it's natural and it smells nice but it burns my eyes and doesn't work at all. It's also not cheap. Bummer.
3,It works,"I find that it removes eye makeup and doesn't irritate my eyes. But, that is what I expect of any eye makeup remover. I didn't find that it cleans in one swipe. Rather, it takes 2-3 passes to get the makeup off, but it doesn't irritate me so I don't mind, really. I like the quantity for the price."
1,Does not work as well as advertised,"While it is gentle and there is no residual oil, it takes a little bit of work to get the make-up off. I use MAC eye liner, and this particular remover does a poor job of taking it all off. It even has a hard time getting normal eye shadow off completely. I have to try at least three times to fully get all of it off, and even then I feel like I need to use another remover to get what this one left behind.Maybe it only works well for certain eye make-ups, but it certainly does not work on mine."
3,Better than some.,"I've heard great things about this remover, so I purchased it. It still requires more rubbing and scrubbing than I want in the eye area. (wrinkles!!!) All color is removed from the upper lid, however the undereye area has a faint shadow. The shadow is better than many others I have tried, but I have to use concealer and foundation over it, even when I don't want to wear makeup. This product doesn't sting, burn or feel oily."
1,"Takes a couple of times to ""work""...","While it is gentle and non-irritating, it takes at least three firm swipes to get most of the make-up off, and even then there's still some left behind. I use MAC liner and regular eye shadow, and it even has a hard time removing the eye shadow fully.May work on other make-ups, but does not work with mine."
2,Cute book but not durable at all!,"Admittedly, I bought this book for my 13 month old to occupy on the airplane. She wasn't very interested in it but my 3-year old niece certainly was. Before we even got to her house, the velcro tab closure had come unglued and the bottom of the book (the binding) had separated from the cardboard.The things inside grandpa's briefcase are very flimsy; both pairs of cardboard glasses had broken (the earpieces ripped off) after playing with them for less than 10 minutes.It's a cute concept but everything in the book is very flimsy, as is the book binding and cover itself. If you can buy it for cheap and don't mind it being basically a one-time only book, then go ahead and buy it. Otherwise, save your pennies."
2,Nice but..,"I loved this book but was disappointed that it looked pretty beat up when my friend took it out of the box. Unfortunately, I did not inspect it beforehand and gave it as a gift. I was surprised that it looked like there was some minor water damage and there were many worn areas. I don't mind that when I purchase things used, it's expected. However, I bought this new because it was meant to be a gift for a friend who just became a new grandfather. This is my first disappointment after many, many purchases. Had I noticed before I gave it out, I would have returned it for a different one."
5,This thing is huge!,"Any kid will go nuts over this huge water spider from Coleman! It's HUGE! So giant and cute and fun! Great for the backyard pool or the beach! Flip it over and it has cup-holders!Seriously, this thing is a must for your backyard pools!"
3,Not A Typical Biography,"If you are looking for a straightforward, chronological biography of Moody, this is probably not for you. The book is very long and includes sermon excerpts and other information. It covers Moody's life but was a little difficult to stay focused, maybe because it adds information about his colleagues as well, and was written as if telling about different aspects of his ministry and life versus just chronological. The style seemed a little difficult to follow as well. Nevertheless, it does provide a thorough account of Moody's life and work."
4,Great Humor,"What a wonderful change of pace. Good, clean Christian humor. Sister Canteloupe reminds me of the outrageous Sister Betty (Pat G'Orge-Walker). I think the two women should get together. There's a message in the humor."
5,For Word Lovers,This history reads like a story. I'd recommend it as the starting place for anyone who wants to explore linguistic history. Lively and accessible.
4,They're no Psykosonik...,"To me it seems like Daniel Lenz was trying to reproduce Psykosonik with this project.. The problem is he failed at it. The music has a definite familiar vibe as Psykosonik once did, and the singer, sounds curiously alot like Paul..However, thats not to say this is a bad CD, infact it's quite good. Had this actually been Paul working with Daniel, this CD would get 5 stars from me. But This does lack in a few areas so i'm giving it a 4.My favorite track is Woven. Try checking out Paul's new project aswell, titled, Basic Pleasure Model."
4,Gossipy rundown of fashion pioneers,"A good read in terms of encompassing mainstream fashionable ""icons"". As a serious fashion text, it lacks specific reference to individual's pioneering efforts and is conspicuously WASP-centric. But on the other hand, the personal dirt makes it fun to read and isn't that part of what fashion is all about? Fun"
4,The Power of Style,"This is an extremely interesting book, perhaps geared more to the more mature reader than the very young, but never the less fascinating from an historical perspective, on the women who had innate style in both fashion and lifestyle in this century. It gives the reader both pictorial and a written information and I think that it is a gem of a book."
3,Interesting and Sad,"This is a good biographical-type book following women who were trendsetters from early to mid-twentieth century. The earlier portraits of the women are interesting because they are less known to modern readers, than say, Jacqueline Kennedy. Nice photographs, good layout. However, I was saddened by the fact that with a few exceptions, most of these women derived their power and style from money -- either inherited and/or married into. These well-bred, intelligent and strong women found no other way to express their individuality or personal power except through the designer clothes, jewelry and ornaments that money could afford them. This book is a fairly good read overall and a revealing snapshot of prominent socialite trendsetters before femminism - nice for a leisurely weekend with a good cup of tea."
3,Could have been better...,"I enjoy this book, but my two biggest complaints are the lack of more colorful photos of the houses and clothes these women lived in. For a coffee-table type book, that is kind of important...too many in here are black and white which is unfortunate given the vivid descriptions. I also heartily dislike the sexist contention that these women were all married to alcoholic, indifferent, possibly homosexual weaklings, which is interesting, since none of these women worked but had to rely on said weaklings' money except for Diana Vreeland and Coco Chanel; maybe that is why these two ladies' contributions are the most impressive. Otherwise, the book is somewhat interesting, but nothing spectacular."
4,Excellent for kids 5 years+,"I purchased this for my son who was asking about our new president's pet. Not only does the book share detailed stories about a crocodile, goats etc that lived in the white house, but it also serves as a great tool to teach him about our presidents. It even mentions George Washington's wooden teeth. It has good illustrations as well."
4,"another buried treasure in coltrane's discography,","this fine set from april, 1957 has two baritone saxophone players joining up with coltrane's tenor. cecil payne and pepper adams deliver fine performances on an album that is quite conventional when compared with what was soon to come from john coltrane. nevertheless, mr trane hits many a moment of intensity here, and fans of his later work should enjoy this release just fine. the excellent piano man mal waldron is on board, too. it's a session that is well worth having."
3,Average Pepper Adams date wrongly attributed to Coltrane...,"Pity about this oner, it is a Pepper Adams record wrongly reissued by Prestige under Coltrane's name, in a sideman appearance and an average one at that. Great RVG remastering as usual, but still, it's nothing more than a routine date, and the continued use of Coltrane's name as the leader is deceptive and should have been corrected - or in some way handled more honestly by Concord."
2,Expecting More,"I saw the first dvd On the Road, I was exciting to find No Restraints on Amazon. I was expecting new performances. I like the first dvd much better."
4,Great Album!,"I think I first heard of Lucifer's Friend in the 80s and concluded that they were some old evil metal band. Fast forward to the late 90s when I got Martin Popoff's Encyclopedia of Heavy Metal. He gave some of the albums good reviews so I decided to get their debut. It contains the classic Ride The Sky. After that I looked for something more modern and metal. I was quite impressed by Mean Machine! Eight of the ten songs made it onto my I-pod. English vocalist John Lawton had just returned after being absent for two albums to join these Germans who know how to make good hard rock. The guitar riffs are great, the choruses are catchy, and Lawton sounds strong. Get it if you can find it, 4 1/2 stars!"
3,AOR and NWOBHM Style Album,"After his stint in Uriah Heep, John Lawton returns to Lucifer's Friend. His voice is as good as ever. But the music is more in the early 80's AOR metal and NWOBHM style. 80's Rainbow or Kiss immediately come to mind. Still, this is an improvement over the previous Lucifer's Friend albums done with Mike Starrs on vocals (Good Time Warrior & Sneak Me In). It's also better than some of Uriah Heep's efforts in the 80's. If you are a fan of Lawton's vocals or of 80's metal, you won't be disappointed at all. I still recommend that you start with their incredible (self-titled) debut from 1971. But this is a pretty solid hard rock album full of good musicianship and the superb voice of Lawton."
5,Lucifers Friend dives into T.N.W.O.B.H.M,"The groups return to hard rock. The lp was released on the heels of John Lawton's ""solo"" album Heartbeat.It was basically a LF lp under another name. Mean Machine was the groups full fledged reunion with Lawton. Each track is like a bolt out of the blue. The bonus 9 are mighty fine as well. Great buy"
1,the colors are poor in this mix and over priced,American DJ robs you blind on the pricesand the quality is very poorI found same iten 2.00 cheaper on another websitebut then again what would they care after they rob you
2,TOO SLOW!!,"Sigh, try as I might, I just cannot get into Celibidache's version of Bruckner's 8th. The ending sounds like he's moving through glue. We're talking about the Apocolyptic symphony here, you know horses, fire, brimstone....Celibidache kills any sense of urgency with his tempo choices (as a side note Haitnik's attempt with the Concertbouw is ENTIRELY too fast). Somewhere right down the middle is better, urgent but not rushed. Look to Maazel/Berlin, Bohm/Vienna, or Wand/Berlin for reference recordings of this. I will say however, Celibidache does coax positively fantastic intensity from the brass players, their playing is very powerful..."
2,S....L....O....W.,"I've listened to plenty of recordings of this symphony. For me the Karajan VPO recording might be the favorite. This performance drags so severely, especially in the last two movements, that the music loses all forward momentum. The sound and playing are agreeable enough, but the interpretation is truly eccentric. The remainder of the recordings in this Celibidache/Munich series are slower than the norm, but not to this extreme degree, and do deserve repeated listening."
3,Taz Seat Cover,The picture shows a brown Taz. The product I received has a RED Taz. I am not fond of this vibrant Taz. I recieved my product in a timely fashion. It fits pretty much like I figured it would but I do not like the RED Taz. I was expecting a brown Taz as the picture shows.
2,"So Sorry, So Sad","I love the Taz cartoon character. So when I ordered this product for my Honda Civic LX, imagine my surprise when it didn't fit. The material was not sturdy at all. I thought if the material was sturdy enough that I could 'make it fit'. Well, whatever!"
2,"Fine, if you don't mind an orange Taz","Thee seat covers are fine as far as quality goes, but good luck getting a matching set. They often arrive with Taz in various shades of brown, and some times Taz is almost orange. Since they are sold individually, it is very annoying to receive seat covers with one orange and one brown Taz (and I have ordered quite a few of these)"
2,undeveloped plots,"the trailer was very misleading, where the pace of the movie was incredibly slow. there are some interesting scenes with carla gugino, but the scene between the two pornstars is very campy, and also the blonde lesbian is very unconvincing--it made me feel like i was watching fake les porn (even tho there's no hardcore or even soft scenes. it was very cheap), which is a shame, since the rest of the movie could have had more substance (i.e. the scene with kid tricking the pyschologist--the character of the kid was most interesting, probably since she's not corrupted yet as the others)."
2,Some funny raw sex jokes + Many dragging scenes + The plot leads to nowhere = This movie is in trouble,"There are some funny raw sex jokes. They make some scenes worth watching.The majority of the scenes are dragging. The plot leads to nowhere. The plot leads to nowhere. Overall, it's not worth it."
3,entertaining film,"A very entertaining and funny film, but no coherent story.The theme is sex, yet no sex scenes, or almost none."
3,DONT REALY KNOW,CANT TELL YOU WAS A GIFT BUT THEY WERE HAPPY SO I THINK ITS FINE SORRY CANT DO BETTER
2,How could Simon Baker have agreed to this trash?,"As a fan of Simon Baker I watch every film he's worked in. He always does a superb job embodying the character he plays. And he did a superb job with the small part he had in this (playing a guy cheating on his wife-but he does change his ways, thankfully). But OMG! What possessed him to agree to be in this? The movie is barf-inducing trash! Do we really have to hear a porn star's lengthy description of having sex with her dog? Most of the other women were equally disgusting in various ways. ""Women in Trouble"" seems more about women (and men) actors getting in career trouble by doing anything to be in a film. I threw the DVD away. Regardless of how much I love Simon Baker's acting, the movie was just too awful."
3,Fun?,Different women of different walks of life met each other in extreme circumstances and shared their intimate experiences as well as an intimacy each with other.Not much to lose if not watching.
3,My Anne Geddes Album,"I was dissappointed with the condition of this item. It was described by the seller as having only slight surface damage.It was considerably more damaged than that - having a one and half inch groove on the front cover, surface scratches and wear and tear on two corners. However, it did appear to be unused on the inside.As I had waited almost a month for delivery I did not return it and am 'making do'. Cheshire Chick."
5,Double high air mattress,"Bought this product for camping. Takes a while to inflate (5-10 mins), but very comfortable to sleep on. I used the coleman 4-D powered pump and it worked rather well. See separate review of that product. I brought a small spring loaded clamp to keep the pump attached to the mattress while inflating. It takes too long to hold the pump the whole time it is inflating.Mattress is not only comfortable but it acts as a stool and changing area as well. I usually bring a small stool to put my shoes on and get dressed inside the tent, but there is no need with this mattress. I added a little air to the mattress each evening before turning in to make sure it was firm enough. You can tell if it needs air if it sags when you sit on the edge.So far we are very pleased with it and are going to use it again next month on our next camping trip."
2,"Great the first night or two, after that be prepared to add air every night","We bought one of these while staying at my in-laws for the holidays. The first night it was great. The second it wouldn't hold air, so we exchanged it and got a new one. This time it lasted a couple of nights (the rest of that stay). We recently got it back out for another trip. We have to add air every night. It's better than sleeping on the floor, but if you are sharing the bed be prepared to be rolling into each other by the time morning comes. Cannot find a leak."
1,leak proof.....not really,"We have owned this bed for a couple years now and used it probably a dozen times. It was great at first, we only had to put in a little air after overnight sleeping on it. But just recently the air mattress has leaked so much we are unable to use it anymore. This was our second coleman air mattress we have purchased. Very dissatisfied and will never buy another coleman air mattress. We were so excited when we found this air mattress because coleman said the air mattress was guaranteed not to leak. But we have learned otherwise."
1,Very dissatisfied customer,"On June 7, 2012 I ordered and received the Coleman Double-High Queen mattress. We had one for many years and were more than satisfied with its performance. We needed a new one and found it on this site. We did not unroll the mattress until we needed it while on vacation last week. It has a huge hole in the middle of the mattress! I cannot believe the poor, unacceptable quality control of the Coleman company! This had to be inspected at some point! To say that I am dissatisfied is putting it mildly! I would NOT recommend this product to anyone!"
1,Expensive and worthless...,"Few things I have ever bought in all of my life proved to be as worthless as this. Previously bought Wal-Mart's own brand air bed that cost half as much and lasted 8 years before ending up with some leaks. Thought I'd replace it with this ""nice"" - double-the-cost - ""reputable"" branded Coleman. What a mistake. In less than 8 weeks - after only the second use - in the areas that one sees in the picture where the dips are contoured into the surface the seams manufactured there started to separate and the bed sprung leaks in two places. A comfortable bed initially - but when you wake up on the floor on deflated vinyl - and with a lot less cash in your pocket - you quickly learn the poor craftsmanship and manufacturing process of whomever makes this for Coleman. DO NOT BUY! AVOID!"
4,Great so far...after a month,"Was looking for a temporary setup until can afford a good new mattress as have a bad back...This may do instead quite well in the long run, if it holds up for a decent amount of time...Which I see no reason it may not...it's made with good quality stuff...Very comfortable once added sleeping bag as cushion pillow...and the bedsheets still fitted...Setup was a quick and easy event...just a few minutes...Also it comes up to knee height, which is very nice..."
1,Bad Product 46 weeks to replace o refund,"Be carefull today after 3 weeks of use i called coleman CUSTOMER CARE DEPARMENT for a replace or refund it TAKES 46 WEEKS, You have to send the valve, the bar code the receive and the label and WAIT FOR YOUR MONEY OR THE REPLACEMENT 46 WEEKS ONLY.This bed supose to be flat like all the beds but it turned like a ballon. It not funny you cannot sleep at all."
4,Camping Slumber,"I really like this mattress, but I don't find it AS comfortable as the low to the ground mattress by Coleman. I think this mattress is a lot more comfortable for a single sleeper vs 2 people. There's a bit of a waterbed feel to it - say if the other sleeper moves, you do get jostled. It's a heck of a lot easier to get out of though, vs the single height mattress. Note: it eats up the battery of my rechargeable pump...and it was difficult to get all the air out on that charge. I did not find that the mattress deflated at all (we've now camped a total of five nights with it.) In fact, I have had to deflate it a bit before going to sleep because I felt it had too much air in it. Despite the downfalls, I will continue to use this mattress and would purchase again."
1,Last about a month then seam split,"I purchased two of these Coleman beds. Both failed after about 1 month of nightly use with only one person sleeping on the bed. I tried to patch the beds, but the patchs failed after a few days. Neither bed was abused in any way. In light of the first failure, I was especially careful with the second bed, but it failed the same way in about the same length of time as did the first bed. The seam split where the oval sections are attached to the top. All the air leaked out quickly. This product may work well for occasional use, but do not count on it as a replacement for a regular bed. I am going to switch to another brand, but which one should I choose?"
5,Find a great book,I think that this book have the most complete information of cosmetology world refer. Is a great book to help the students in their carrer.
5,Outstanding!,I use this book every time I work on a quilt. The descriptions are easy to understand and the results are great. With this book I learned how to miter my borders as well as the binding and this technique has given my quilts a more sophisticated look. I consider myself a beginner-intermediate quilter so if I can uderstand this book anyone can!
5,GREAT QUILT FINISHING REFERENCE!,"I've owned this book and used it for quite some time. A good book on FINISHING a quilt is rare, and I would be lost without this one in my library. It is so helpful that I've purchased it for two other quilters."
5,Love Them !!!!,My yorkshie 6 year old can't be fooled...this is the only chew he will eat (the ones in the bag will not do). The vet has been very pleased at Neptune teeth since he has been chewing them (about 2 years now). Try them it may save the teeth of your little friends. Kathy
4,Would be 5 stars if larger & had photos,"I didn't realize this is a small, yet thick, paperback style book. I thought it would be a larger soft back style, but didn't read the descriptions close enough. HOWEVER, I've tried a couple of the recipes and they are delicious! I found a new favorite meat loaf recipe along with many new ones I want to try such as muffins & rolls. Nearly every recipe looks yummy; most are your basic recipes any standard Betty Crocker would have, but found I like the Pillsbury variations better. I'd highly recommend getting this, especially since used sells for less .... That is all I paid and it was worth every penny!"
3,Different than the original version,"I Love my original ""The Pillsbury Cookbook."" However I got it wet and ordered another copy. I was shocked to see the book was a different size - it is now the size of a paperback novel and lacked the pictures. I treasure the recipes so I will use it as a back-up book. It is a great resource."
2,Not the version I'd expected,"I had loved the original book, which was also paper back. The original was large with pictures. The one sent is a good pocket version, same great recipes, just very small."
5,Gotta have one,"Love this cookbook. Has all the basics in it, easy to grab. It's small, can keep handy. Recipes are good, sound. I've had multiple copies throughout the years. I got one for all my adult kids, in case they can't get a hold of me for directions :-) Service was prompt."
2,The Pillsbury Cookbook,We bought this cookbook from Amazon.com for our Grand Daughter and did not realize it would be so small. It is only four inches by seven inches. Had we known it was so small we would have not bought it. We do not feel it meets the quality expected from a Pillsbury Cookbook.
4,Regarding the Paperback edition,"Please be careful and read the description. This is a paperback cookbook, like a novel, NO PICTURES in the paperback. I bought this book for my son as a housewarming gift. Fortunately he is familiar enough with the well-used LARGE SOFTCOVER edition that I have WITH PICTURES that he might do well with this.At any rate, I would have preferred the SOFT COVER with PICTURES, BUT there is still everything you need to know about how to cook in this useful tool. If you have never cooked before, this book will easily teach you methods, basic recipes and how to modify them, standard cooking times and temps, when to buy your fruits and vegetables, and how to substitute among so many other things."
4,Basic All Purpose Cookbook,This was a gift for my stepson who just got his first house and needed a cookbook. This was as close to my 1968 vintage Pillsbury Cookook (that I still use often) that I could find.
4,A decent book on the six day war,"This book has given some interesting insight into the men and women behind the six day war. While I wouldn't classify this book as a historical novel, Berkman captured their personalities with much accuracy."
4,Sheldon Sings!,This is one of those rare albums where you can hear Jack sing as well asplay. Very good and well worth it if you are one of his fans. I thinkhe is simply unequaled as a musician.
4,You need to show team spirit and support,"I bought this for my Tiger husband fan for chilly games. Hasn't worn it yet, but really likes it."
5,cannot recommend enough,"this is a wonderful, wonderful book. my husband & I went through this together, & it really helped us unpack our issues with communication. marriage is a lifelong learning experience, for sure. this book is a wonderful text to help along the journey."
5,Great.,Great music. Words are simple easy to understand. Melody and rythm I love them. I can even imagine the 'movimientos' of Chayanne when I listen his songs.
1,The appearance of this is distracting from an otherwise well-written book,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer that the presentation of this material is badly dogged by its appearance. This is unfortunate because, as you strugle to ""fill in the blanks"" where the text is garbled, it takes much longer to understand what the author was trying to say. One of the worst ebooks that I have ever tried to read. However, because the author was so descriptive of Mexico in the early 1900's, I may try to find a hard copy just to better understand the story."
1,Very bad electronic version,"The kindle version was free. You get what you pay for. It is unreadable electronically. There are thousands of misplaced characters imbedded in the words. Sometimes you cannot decipher the words at all. Sadly, this is a book I was very interested in."
3,Very confusing at times.,The theme in this story is somewhat confusing at times. I goes from one scenario to another without proper connection to the plot at current time.
2,Some interesting tips&#65533;but the book encourages lying.,"The book has some good tips on getting your voice mail messages returned, but a great many of these tips involve deception. I don't need to read a book on how to come up with whopper stories-that comes easily for most people. While lying may get someone to return your calls-that is not the reason for your call. You want to build a relationship on a solid foundation-lying to clients does not work!"
1,Not what I thought,This book was not exactly what I wanted...maybe I should have done more homework. I find the advise pushy and out of my comfort zone. Below many of the suggested tactics there is a warning that you need to be careful who you use these on because they might not appreciate and could be offended. I found nothing in this book that is useful. If your a high corporate sales person more power to you and maybe these will work for you...but for the rest of us...I say stay away from this book and try something else.
4,Blue Mountain Music Reviews,"I must admit, for an obscure album, this one is quite a find, in any condition. If you want a true Celtic/Scottish Rock record, this is worth a little extra effort. Start with the rousing ""Rosettes"". Each tune connotes a true feeling of rising in a hard-working, blue collar factory town struggling to live, but understanding what it takes to have fun. Each song is a story, some better than others, but the stories are compelling, nonetheless. ""A Place in the Sun"" tells the story of traveling with no idea how to make ends meet, and the things they uncover along the way. Best story song? ""Company Town"", which tells the story of a hometown where the local manufacturing facility runs everything, including your life. Best overall track? ""Rain, Steam & Speed"", which tells the story of the construction of the chunnel between the UK and France. Sit back, listen and learn...or better yet, put on yer kilt and start moving! R."
2,"Poor quality, no support","Before buying this, try to get an ART support inquiry link. As of writing I can't. This product comes with virtually no support that I can personally find.If I had known, I would have added the difference and bought an entry level audio interface from Roland or one of the other popular brands."
4,Nice price and results,"This is not the best pre amp to buy, but for the price, it does everything you need to have a nice input to your computer."
3,Its ok but must max levels to get decent sound out.,"The old usb connector is sort of weird, I had to turn all levels up to the max to get a decent audio signal out, I use it for podcasting."
4,Great item with one glaring omission,"This is a terrific little preamp/phantom power/usb interface, though it lacks the easy portability of the Centrance Micport Pro or the Shure X2U. Unfortunately, it also lacks a 1/8"" headphone port that the Micport Pro and X2U have (including volume control for the headphones) which means there is no way to monitor input real time without using your PC's headphone port and its associated latency. Some would consider a real time headphone port essential, including me. The ART also requires AC adapter power, unlike the previously mentioned USB devices powered through the USB port. This and its size makes the ART a little cumbersome if you have to record ""on the go"" (away from studio/home). On the plus side, it does ""warm"" the finished product for voice recording and is very easy to use. I'd have given it five stars if it had had a headphone port and volume control. M-Audio makes a comparable device (more expensive) that has a 1/8"" headphone port."
4,Alien invasion on a water world in the hub,"This is one of Schmitz's Tales of the Hub, with a character first introduced in Analog in a story called Trouble Tide. Dr. Nile Etland, a futuistic version of a limnologist, lives and works on a watery world that has been secretly invaded by an alien fleet hiding in the depths, and on one of the strange floating islands of that world. Nile Etland is a Schmitz heroine, and the aliens are evicted rather forcefully, with an assist from Nile. The ecology of the world is a major factor in the story, as is the quest for immortality. Quite a good read. Lots of action, interesting ideas, and a likable main character, with a sudden and useful switch of viewpoint at the end."
4,Super Reader,"Alien repulsion otter assist.On an obscure planet an alien force that had previously tried to take territory in the Hub has a breakaway political group that decides to do some smalltime invasion.A smart scientist, a local agent and their highly intelligent new species mutant otter friends are up to the challenge, though, at least until the Federation warships can get there to offer a hand.A fast-paced action adventure with some superhuman subterfuge and an interesting epilogue type overview of some of what is really going on.3.5 out of 5"
4,Great inexpensive cable,"This cable is great, Im using three of them for my home theater in my AX720 and my optical switch. These work great however the terminator on each cable is slightly longer than usual so the fit depending on your receiver might be an issue and it wont be as secure as you'd expect also careful removing the caps, I managed to pull the fiber off one of the terminators when I pulled it off initially."
3,Fits loose in XBOX360 optical out,"Purchased this cable for the XBOX360 optical out. Quality is nice, but the plug fits loosely in the jack. I have to be extra careful not to bump the cable because if I wiggle the connector, the audio gets noisy due to ambient light leaking in. Difficult to say whether the fault lies with the X360 jack or the connector on the cable. Cable itself is nice and ... ""supple""."
4,good product,"durable, seems like it will do the trick although I have not had a chance to actually use it. We'll see."
2,I will never buy this again,"Mediabridge is a lot better. This one never snaps in. As some of the others mentioned....very loose fit. I wonder why they made it like that. It works though. But, you move your AV receiver or the DVD player and it falls off. Pretty annoying."
4,Pretty alright :),"Not much to say about these but they work ok but I rather get opticals from Monoprice since it looks abit more premium and cheaper.On fitment, not entirely the best as its not very tight with my ps3 and amp but that I guess thats pretty usual for cables (or optical ports is to be blame) ;)"
3,cheap,"Digital signal is either there or not, so in that sense...it does the job as good as any cable could. However, it is loose in the socket and could be knocked out easily. My other optical cables fit much tighter in the same socket."
5,FFXI - more time,I just wish the free trial lasted longer. It is easy to get lost in the world of vana'diel
3,Interested.,"I had saw some friends of mine playing this one night and got real interested. So I bought my own copy of the set, and got it installed. I've enjoyed this game quite a bit-- I'm used to the play style of World of Warcraft so this was a nice change-- even though it's very different than WoW is, it has its own nice quirks about it. I gave it 4 out of 5 only because some of the game play was a little redundant."
3,Lags alot,"My husband really likes this game, but it lags alot on our new Vista operating system, we've tried to find help from PlayOnline and our internet provider, but it still lags a little bit."
1,Paying for online play is BS,Was shipped fast.. if you have to pay a monthly subscription to play a game it isn't worth it with all the other games out there that don't charge.
2,For hardcore ki ki ki grinding,Only huge Final fantasy fans will like this game. As it has nothing to do with any other FF game. To lv up at a point in the game you must have a party of 6. Which makes the game quite hard. Expect lots of waiting for parties/crying. This a MMORPG so it will naturally steal your soul. This game not recommended.
2,so-so for an MMO,"I was sick of waiting for the expansion to WoW and had heard some good things about FFXI. The graphics were descent, but the character control was very ackward. I ended up canceling it before the 30 day trial and went back to playing my old standby of UO while I wait for BC."
3,"Decent book overall, but too long","I finally finished reading this whole book. I was tempted to give up many times because frankly it can be boring and repetitive in many places. Overall it was a pretty mind numbing experience.I would not suggest reading it if you have objections to religious teachings. As this book was written for that purpose, teaching virtues of the church. I did appreciate all of the lessons the book taught and I do beleive I gained some appreciation for life and humility.As said earlier it was quite repetitive, and I beleive it could have been shortened by cutting out some of the first half. It seemed all they did in that part was kill everything in sight and build stuff over and over and over. Also many of the scenarios were plain unrealistic almost to the point of fantasy. It was almost like they landed in Eden and were ""blessed"" with every single possible animal in existence running around on the island."
2,Swiss family Robinson,"The Swiss Family Robinson, a title for a book which tells you a lot and yet tells you very little. A story that some people my say a story of heroics or bravery. I didn't get that from the story, instead I got sort of bland story that tells about a family that is pretty unrealistic. The main character is a Swiss pastor who seems to know everything, and his wife and three boys. When their boat is terribly shipwrecked, they build rafts and set their course for a nearby island. The story is about their adventures on the island. Never of less, the youngest boy is very charming and in no part in the story is it sad. Even though it might seem like I hated this book, I thought it was OK book and I wouldn't suggest you don't read this book."
2,Boring,"This book was really boring. It gets off to a great start, a family stuck on an island, but then it just gets slower and slower. The Dad won't stop preaching. Much better movie"
3,Oldy But Goodie,"This is a great classic. Everyone can read this book, and will enjoy it. This book is about how a family get shipwrecked and stays together, and they don't just sit around they start building a house and getting food. After a while the family starts to enjoy the island, and they start to consider it as ""Home"". I have to say this is a great book and teaches you that you have to be thankful for what you have (a family). GO GET THE BOOK!!!!"
3,Oldie but GOODIE!,"This book is a great classic, and is not like those new movies. This is more interesting and most of all a fun book. This book is about a family who gets shipwrecked. They all stay together, and they also work together. They build a house, explore the island, and gather food. The family ends up going through a couple little adventures, such as when they travel in their tiny boat and find a woman on the island. No matter what happens they stay together. One day a ship finds them and part of the family choose to stay and some went on the ship back home. This book is all about family and never give up hope, even if you are shipwrecked in the middle of nowhere. Have fun and get the book.=)"
3,Other Books,"A fairly low-key and low-rent adventure story. A shipwreck, and miraculously all who survive are of one family unit, plus some pets and enough livestock and food animals to keep them going.They have to contend with the wildlife, build a tree house and other sorts of things to survive. Pretty tame all around, this story."
5,Great Story,My 9 year old loves this book! What's nice is she is taking a while to read it as opposed to finishing a book lickety split! She is excited about the story and fills me in with what is happening in each chapter. Highly recommend.
1,A Story Of Advenchure,I Rate this book a one becuase I do NOT like survile storys. It would be better if it had more advenchure.
2,Fate worse than death,"I don't agree with the classification of this book as ""ages 9 through 12."" I was more like 13 when I read it and it was still so obscure and full of narrative passages that went on and on and on and on. Very little dialect. Nightmarishly boring. Nothing like the fast-moving, fun, kind of silly Disney movie. One case where the movie's ok but the book's a must-miss."
3,Swiss Family Robinson,"Many say that the classic Swiss Family Robinson by Johann David Wyss is better in the books. After all, word has it, book is better than movie. But the fact is, there are many different ""Swiss Family Robinson"" books out there. There are the boring ones, the educational ones, the religious ones, and the exciting ones. On of the books I read suposedly written by Wyss, was an educational, yet boring kind of book. Near the end, there were no pirates coming to take the 0cabin ""boy"" away. Most of the books are NOT like the Disney movie that so many have seen. The only Swiss Family book that is like the Disney movie, is the Disney vesion book. I rest my case."
2,Did not live up to our expectations.,"This reading of The Swiss Family Robinson was not a true representation of the book. It was abridged down so far that it became more of an overview. Several of the basic facts from the book were switched around for no apparent reason and the general theme of faith in God and strong values brought out in the book are all but ignored in this rendition. The other complaint we had was the actual reading of this abridged version. For an actor we found him extremely lacking in zeal and extremely monotone. It was almost comical how he could read the exciting bits with so little inflection. The musical interludes and background were good. It was a good overview in general, even if the facts were messed up. I would only recommend this to someone, however, if the integrity of the original manuscript means nothing to them."
1,"""What are the Robinson's going to kill tonight?""","I read this with my 8 year old daughter. When she and I would prepare to read each evening we would joke "" Lets see what the Robinson's kill tonight?"" Then there is the crazy array of animals. Where in the world can you find Kangaroos, Antelope, Grizzly bears and condors without being in the St. Louis Zoo? This became stupidly funny and neither of us could take any of the book seriously. We finished it just to see how it ended. Even without the killing and impossible aminals it would have been dry and boring from the never ending descriptions of plants discovered and rigging gadgets from stuff they found, which is why Disney added Pirates to their version. I don't reccomend this book at all!"
3,Little dino's,"This game's cool dinosaur shaped pieces are definately a plus. It can be played with 2 players, but is a much better game with more. After each turn, you have to move the hexagonal game pieces further apart to simulate the continents breaking apart. While a cool concept, after several turns, it gets very confusing trying to figure out how far away the pieces are from the center and how pieces should be moved. Having a large grid or solid gameboard to place underneath the pieces would be a good improvement. Plan on spending at least an hour reading/understanding the rules. I'm giving this a rating of a '3' because while I like it (despite noted flaws), most people I've played with have not enjoyed the game. I would recomend Settlers of Catan and Carcassone over this game."
4,Words to LOSE BY!,"This book was recommended by a client. I bought it. It sat on the table while I trained and completed the San Diego Marathon. Oh, how I wish it had been a part of my training!. My husband wanted to lose 20+ lbs. so we began together. 8 weeks and 25 lbs. for him and 9 lbs. for me we can't believe it. Never have either of us lost bulk like this. We feel great-look great-and know this is a lifestyle worth following.I recomment it for anyone wanting to get off the fat-fad treadmill."
3,Easier to understand than The Zone,"40-30-30 takes The Zone approach and makes it understandable. It gives you all the information you need to know without all of Barry Sears' gobbledygook. Procedurally, this is much easier to follow. It does, however, fall a little short on recipes."
1,Readers please beware of uninformed dieting!!!,"Our body needs 55% of total calories to come from carbohydrates, 30% (or less) to come from fat, and ONLY 15% from protein. I feel this book is misleading...we need a high percentage of carbohydrates for energy!!!!!"
3,Great book but where is the INDEX!!!,"I found the information and recipes in this book terrific but was very frustrated by the lack of an index which can make locating information or recipes very difficult! If they had included an index, I would have given it a 5 star rating."
5,"Has changed my life and size..friends are having success,too","It Works! I followed the fat flush diet for two weeks and lost 10 lbs....by the third week down 15 lbs....I was so impressed had to tell my friends who are having the same results.....this combined with the Rexall Bioslife Fiber has been astounding...the book is readable, practical and I am a believer!!!!"
4,It Works!,"I just tried this diet 3 days ago and I have lost 6 pounds. At first, I just can't believe it would work out. I used to follow the low-fat, high carb diet and I only lost 4 pounds in 2 weeks. I was very frustrated. I tried herbal products and everything, but it didn't work out. First I tried this diet, I don't feel like it's a diet, because I never skip meal and I can eat delicious breakfast without feeling guilty. I've just exercised once, and I've lost this much. I'm getting motivated to lose even more with more exercise. However, I only give 4 stars, because I don't really like the meal. I hate turkey and pork. I'm just stuck with chicken, and ham. And, I've never had a chance to find this Whey protein powder anywhere in the drugstore. Anyone have any idea?"
2,Starvation plan,"I am a major fitness buff who is close to competing in fitness competitions. I just needed a little help with the diet so I looked for a book. This book has the right idea in balancing out the food groups but they sarve you to death. I am 5'4 and 120 lbs (all muscle). They had me eating 1,069 calories a day. I can eat however I want and lose weight on that amount. A person has a basic set of calorie needs just to live. You add on top of that your caloric needs for your activity level. Then you either exercise alot or cut back no more than 200 calories a day. This book is a joke. I suggest that you research this and go with the PR Bar company. Its a 40-30-30 plan also but they detail it to your weight, height and activity level. It comes with a cookbook and they are there for 24 hour support if you need them. Talk to Rob he is my support person and also a personal trainer. If you are going to do it do it right! Good luck."
3,sleaves only easily hold one cd each,"I have found the CD sleaves very useful, but although the manufacturer claims that each holder will store two cd's, it is nearly impossible to get two cd's into each sleave. I suggest storing only one cd per sleave, otherwise scratches to the cd's may occurr."
4,The only Dance Album you'll need!,"I love this album! It has all the right stuff that makes you want to get up and dance. I never leave home with out it. Anytime I feel blue I pop it in and let the beat take me away. There is not a bad song on it and if you like dance music that won't get boring after the first few cords then this is it! It's also played in a lot of moives, like the ""Cutting Edge"" and more. So if you hate taking risks on a chance you get a good dance album, this one puts them all aside! Buy it, you won't hate your self later! Mindy Johnson"
4,Back to the 90's,"It's good to hear the big voice of Martha Wash in Black Box (never knew who was the girl appeared in the videos, but well... for me it's the voice, not the look the important thing).All the hits, very good megamix. Over 70 minutes of classic dance music"
3,Italino House at its best,"I love the thourght of a band that only releases one album also releases a greatest hits CD.But Black Box was the band that started the whole Italion House and I love it.If you dont have ""Ride on time"" In our collection of get this one. but the best Black Box CD I have is still ""Right on Time"" the origenal 12"" Extended Mix"
2,"hard to use, no photos","I could not use this on a hike to identify plants. It is a lot of writing and few drawings plus no photos. The organization is hard to find things using the kindle version on a samsung galaxy s3. I do not recommend this item for novices in the field. However, you can try it out and return it for a full refund without hassle if tou download the kindle version."
5,Amazing!,"I have been using Linspire since version 3.0 instead of Microsoft Windows. Linspire is more stable, more secure, and a whole lot cheaper. With CNR (click-n-run) you can install over 1900 programs for free if you are a CNR member. I can get the same set up for 100.00 that Microsft will want thousands for.Linspire has saved my family a ton of money. I definatley give it a 5 out of 5."
5,linspire rocks,"linspire is the best choice ive ever made. i switched durning the summer of this year (04). Ive never had to worry about a virus, hacker, a worm, a crash.and i can install software with a click of a button through cnr.linspire is the choice os. i highly reccomend it!!!!!!it is the stablest os there is!www.linspire.com....youll be glad you visited!"
1,Not interesting,I was unable to finish this book. I just was unable to get interested in it. I would try her other books though.
3,"OK, but not worth the price","I purchased these to use on a long overseas trip. It was comforting to have a clean face and body mitt. It was OK for face, but not the best for body. They are soft, which wont bother your face. However, there is no exfliation for body. They didnt try as fast as the other Aquis produts. I also found that using it as a mitt, wasnt too practical. I wish I had brought regular wash cloths with me instead."
5,Smooth BB,"The Dura Ace 7700 BB is somewhat of an odd duck in the Shimano line. It turns very smoothly, but it seems that most riders hate it because of the frequent maintenance required on account of of the loose needle and ball bearings. I ride about 2-3k miles per year in pretty much all weather types and pull it apart at the start of every season. The first BB went bad after over 10 years on the bike (only 3 of those or about 9k miles were in my ownership); much better than any cartridge-types I own. If this new BB lasts that long I will be thrilled!"
5,READ THIS BOOK!!,"After reading this book, I bought additional copies and have given them away and plan to buy more to give away. While I have been a Christian for many years, there were parts of the good news that were obscured for me by our cultural biases and some of the teachings I grew up with. Dallas goes to the heart of the message that Jesus taught about the Kingdom of Heaven and explains it in a way that makes sense. Since reading this book, I have been able to relax into God's plan for my life. God used this book to talk to me directly. My advice to every Christian is to read it."
5,Buy it and read it!,"I am enjoying this book tremendously. I'm starting to re-think my use of a highlighter, though, since I am highlighting more than not. It might be quicker to highlight the sentences that I don't find especially enlightening. This book is so packed with spiritual insight that you CANNOT rush through it. Each paragraph would be a chapter in most of today's Christian books. If you like CS Lewis and George McDonald, you'll love Dallas Willard. For an ""old school"" look at the teachings of Christ brought up-to-date by a phenomenal communicator, this book is it!"
4,Worth a second read as well!,"Willard has produced a wonderful and inspired book that puts Jesus back in our daily lives like no other since R. Patton's ""THE Autobiography"". The second reading reveals nuggets of hidden wisdom that the first reading may not reveal. Highly recommended."
3,"A few great insights, but some limitations as well...","This book was recommended to me. If it was not, I probably wouldn't have made it through - for two reasons:First, the beginning chapters deal with topics that I believe have been covered better by others. Secondly, the theology on the Beatitudes (Blessed is the...etc.) is inaccurate. His interpretation just doesn't fit the text. He is a philosopher, not a theologian, and it shows.However, as the book progresses, it really improves. His emphasis on discipleship is right on. If you can get through the first half of the book, you will be rewarded. There are some great insights and challenges. It will make you really think about the life you are living and whether it really fits within God's will for you."
4,Deep Truths in an Easy to Read Format,"I like Dallas Willard. He couples philosophy with theology and offers a Christian voice of amazing depth to our sometimes shallow world. However, like other deep thinkers he can often be hard to read. . . . BUT, . . . this book is not like that. In this book Willard hits a literary home run by coupling depth with clarity. So far, this is my favorite of all of his books."
5,Not hype but real discipleship,"The Divine Conspiracy, along with Dr. Willard's other books, is one that every Christian should read at least once, and refer to zillions of times. It's not entertainment or hype,as some reviewers, apparently, would have liked. Neither is Dr. Willard trying to win some kind of popularity contest. What he does so faithfully and eloquently, is show the reader what discipleship looks like by examining the words of Jesus. He compels us to walk with the living Christ, learning from Him how to walk, talk, think--how to live. Dr. Willard causes us to re-examine our understanding of what it means to be ""saved"", to be a follower of Jesus, and to be a Christian. I approach Dr. Willard's books knowing that he will provide pearls of wisdom and I am so very grateful and encouraged to him for his work and his example."
3,Important topic but...,"I found the chapter on the beatitudes disapppointing. The author could have used other biblical passages than the beatitudes to make his point that the gospel is for all people, even ""those who, from the human point of view, are regarded as the most hopeless."" (page 116) The author states that his interpretation of the beatitudes is necessary to combat a legalistic misinterpretation of them, but his interpretation seems to have a dismissive effect by reducing the beatitudes to only a statement of who can start off as disciples of Jesus. I don't disagree with his point that the gospel is for all people, just his use of the beatitudes to make this point."
3,Good,"I enjoyed many sections of this book. It was a little long for me overall, but still a good book."
5,I love this book!,This book gives you so much to think about that it must be read at least twice to get the full measure of what the author is explaining. Just too much wisdom to sink in the first time around!
5,A profound rediscovery of Jesus teachings,"I'm loath to even attempt to review this book, as I don't think I can really do it justice, but I'll make a brief recommendation. The Divine Conspiracy by Dallas Willard is a very stimulating discussion of the teachings of Jesus, encouraging the reader to take seriously a commitment to being a student (disciple) of Jesus as we live our lives, rather than settling for mediocrity and 'consumer Christianity'. It ranges from a look at where Christianity stands at present, what the Kingdom of God actually means in the universe through to the essence of what it means to be a devoted follower of Jesus. Willard provides a refreshing take on the Sermon on the Mount and the Beatitudes which looks at the whole message in context rather than as a series of unrelated commands which seem impossible to live up to. At points it's heavy going, but I'd definitely recommend taking the time to devour this book - it's one of the most powerful that I've read."
4,Missing the Obvious,"Though there are some problems with Willard's work, his main point stands: We as Christians today do not take Jesus seriously and there is more to the gospel than just ""getting saved."" That is good enough, but it is stopping short of the fulness of salvation God intends for us. He intends for us to live in the pattern of Christ, to have access to the Kingdom of God in our everyday lives, not just after we die. Willards explanation of the Beatitudes is also brilliant, though I don't necessarily agree with the conclusions he comes to each time.It only remains for me to take Jesus' words seriously, which is very hard. It has always been hard, even for those who heard those words from Him in person. ""Those who hear my words and DO them...."" So Willards work both simplifies the Christian life, and challenges us."
5,Encouragement to my soul...,"Willard masterfully walks the reader through the Sermon on the Mount and many other key teachings of Jesus on the Kingdom of God and discipleship. This book truly inspired me to walk deeper with Jesus. If some of this thinking started spreading through the church, I wonder if we'd find ourselves in amidst a spiritual revival. You'll want to dive into the teachings of Jesus and live them out with everything you have once finishing this book.Warning: The book started off slow for my taste, but after sticking with it, by the second chapter I was hooked."
2,"CLAIMS to be ""digitally remastered"" Don't believe it!","If this is a ""digital remaster,"" it is a digital remaster of a vastly inferior copy of the film. I just received the set today (five months after ordering it) and have only viewed ""Angel and the Badman"" (which is the main reason i purchased the set). The video is quite shaky (looks like someone was holding a hand held camera to copy this dvd)! The DVD set also claims to be ""sound enhanced"" Don't believe that either. The sound is extremely muffled. The old VCR tape i have of this film is quite superior.I am extremely disappointed that American Movie Classics (which claims to seek to preserve the classics) would put out such an inferior copy! I certainly hope that the Wayne Estate puts out an offical copy of the film (and certainly hope there's a better original print out there somewhere to make a better DVD release)!"
2,Not real good,"I bought this to communicate with friends for a cruise in Mexico. They did not work well on the ship, at all. Basically you had to be 50 feet away for them to work.Even in Mexico, while on land, they were not very good."
3,Not as good as i hoped,"It is not as good as i hoped. Bottom line, too much batteries, (batteries are expensive) and it goes through them like a fat woman through chocolate.I will write a review on batteries as soon as i find them and boy will they get theirs.Motorola is not the best walkie talkie company. Its range is only 5 miles that five miles can make the difference between life and death when you are lost in a vietnamese jungle during the rainy season.And it is too quiet and their are not enough channels. And when you are playing mission impossible in the heating vents the range is reduced to like, 30 feet more or less. And shortly after mission impossible it ran out of batteries."
2,Elmo's Busy Baby Book,"This book doesn't have many flaps, and the Busy Baby Toy part of it has never interested my 11 month old. We've since bought other lift-the-flap books with much more success."
2,not recommended though it does have some cuteness factor,"Its not worth paying for that toy bar which looks cute on paper, but doesn't really work well in practice. He has had this since 6 months old, and it is very difficult/close to impossible for my now 17 mo old son to work anything except the black and white roller. So while he does love the big peek-a-boo and other flaps inside the book, even I find it hard to push the triangle squeaky or turn that green dial or push the blue square, the toy is built way too stiff!!! he has done fine with similar concept toys like his crib activity center, so it is not for lack of know-how or trying.The flaps in elmo's lift and look around the corner or one of the other big sesame street flap books are much more educational and just as much fun."
5,The Rock; Robert Doherty,"Great book to start off reading before going into the Area 51 novels. Excellent author, but not his real name."
3,Very entertaining - too many errors,"This book, as well as the area 51 books, is a very entertaining read. Mr. Doherty (Mayer) spins a good tail. There are a few mistakes in the book, however, that are distracting (I won't ruin it for you, they are worth looking for.) I recommend this book if you like a good story and don't get put off by mistakes."
5,This book is entertaining and it makes you think.,"This is the best story I've ever read. It's good because the story is entertaining. I read this book in 4 1/2 hours. I couldn't put it down. I love his Are 51 books, but I definatly think that this story was superior. I'd love a sequal, but the ending didn't seem to lead to another. I guess I can just hope! Jesse"
2,Not great science fiction.,"I think it is rather poorly written and at times downright boring. I couldnt get into it. Some science fiction folks may like it, though."
3,"Good book, poor scan to ebook!","While the story itself is engrossing and well written, the conversion to the ebook format was poorly executed. The text is full of conversion errors. The letter ""I"" is frequently rendered as a ""1"". ""Bravo"" is ""Barvo"", and the list goes on. Obviously a poor and unchecked OCR conversion!This is not the first ebook with numerous errors, but you would think Amazon would have more respect for it's readers and the author. This was NOT a 99 cent book!Amazon, you have great products and service, but you need to get your ebook house in order."
5,Excellent book.,"This is a great, original work of science fiction with a military thriller angle. Excellent twists and a great ending. I would highly recommend you give it a read!"
4,The Rock,"Having gotten the whole series, I just don't think this is the end, there are some things hanging. But other than that it was an enjoyable read."
4,A WINNER,This book is well written and warms up nicely laying the background and painting a great picture. But hold on to your britches as the ending winds up in a fast and furious pace and you will find that you can't turn the pages fast enough! It will make you want to start all over and read it again!
4,I really enjoyed this.,"An enjoyable cautionary tale with well developed premises, and poorly developed characters. By a less skilled author a I would be less negative, but this one can do better. THEN AGAIN THIS AUTHOR'S DEFICIENCIES ARE MOST AUTHORS SUCCESSES."
3,the rock,Starts out med fast catching your interest but slows in the middle with not much action. Ending makes a nice twist and lets you use a little imagination for your own thoughts of what comes next.
3,Area 52?,"I have read all the ""Area 51"" books and the ""Physic Warrior"". They were pretty good and had a reasonable premise. I did not like this book as much because it was just odd. I can't find the word I need. The ending was a bit off as well. Character interaction was weird as well. You could not really get behind any of them. If this is the first book then I probably won't read anymore. I am neutral on a recommendation because there are better books."
3,The Rock,"It wasn't what I expected and I was a bit disappointed. It was easy to read but the whole ""alien thing' reminded me of a 'Star Trek' movie. I much prefer the 'Area 51' series."
4,Very entertaining!,Again a book full of suspense by Doherty. He knows how to get a grip on his readers. His characters here are weaker than those depicted in the Area 51 series. But the plot is well constructed and makes a pageturner of this book. There is a little bit of mankind's doom and a reflection of the chaotic world order after the fall of the Soviet empire in this novel. A very entertaining book for lazy days.
4,Get the other one,"""Anything Goes"" is a really great show, accompanied by really great songs. This CD is great and I loved it until I bought the 1988 London Studio Cast recording of ""Anything Goes."" I would recommend getting that CD instead of this one, but this one is almost as great. Also, the 1988 recording has more songs than this CD and those songs are really good. The 1962 off-Broadway recording has only 13 songs (and is missing some of the really great songs) and I would not get that CD."
4,"Holy Cow, can Patti LuPone sing!","This is a sharp, energetic rendition of Anything Goes! The best part really is that Patti LuPone is in the majority of the numbers and really makes it all worth listening to if it wasn't already. She truly makes the part of Reno Sweeney her own and her voice is vibrant, flexible and gorgeous. Some of the other songs seem a little boring in comparison with hers, but I still very much enjoy listening all the way through."
5,Not Anything But One of the Best,"I have heared many recordings for Cole Porter 's "" Anything Goes "", but I like this one the best. The opening song is a historic and rare recording by Cole himself. This CD is a revised version of this song that was played in Lincoln Center in New York. Pattie LuPone has a truly beautiful ,strong yet sentimental voice. I highly recommend it"
2,not impressed,"I did not feel that this recording gave any flavor of a good production of Anything Goes. The one section that bothered me the most was the shortened ""I want to row on the crew"" jammed together with a short section of ""Sailor's Chantey"". Why did they do this? Also I was not impressed with the rendition of Blow, Gabriel, Blow. Perhaps I would have appreciated this CD more had I seen the revival from which it was taken, but as a stand alone it is lacking. The new Roundabout theater revival with Sutton Foster and Joel Gray pleases me more; but then I saw the show three times so perhaps I am biased. The liner notes for the Lincoln Center production do provide the lyrics to the songs and a plot summary, which is nice."
5,Stellar as always!,"Wow! I just want to say thank you to the seller first off - the quality was incredible! Thank you so much! Secondly, this production is phenomenal! Patti LuPone really gives it her all here and it shows! I love this show and this recording is the best representaion to Cole Porter and his wonderful music! What a performance! I'm sad I didn't get to view it Live at the Lincon Center!"
3,"Good, but not the best I've heard it......","As someone who's actually performed this show (not on Broadway, unfortunately), I must say this isn't the best score I've heard. It's good, but I find the singing a little too stiff and fast overall, especially in some of the ""romantic"" songs (All Through The Night, It's Delovely). Reno's part, however, shines through as one of the best I've ever heard. Also, this version lacks some of the great pieces that were added to the show earlier. All in all, I'd have to recommend the 1962 off-broadway version over this one."
4,I admit I like this,I don't know why. I'm not a big fan of musicals but ever since my High School attempted to do this musical I've loved the music. I guess its just good fun in a cheesy 50's american way. This and Cabaret are the only musicals I listen to.
5,Anything Goes Cd Review,"The product arrived in only a few days, and in great condition. Usually it takes about a week for my orders to arrive. I was pleasantly surprised."
5,Patti LuPone really shines.,"This is a wonderful classic show with some of Cole Porter's best songs. The original star,Ethel Merman, never got to record this show in it's entirety. That being said, I believe that this cd captures the same excitement as a Merman performance. Patti LuPone is brilliant! She well deserves the same legendary status as Merman, Martin, Channing, and Verdon. The rest of the cast is terrific and the recording is alive with theater presence. This version and the 1962 Off-Broadway cd are both great."
5,really wonderful cast album,"""Anything Goes,"" is a great musical and this version is updated and really in tune. I'd reocmmend it to any musical theatre fan. Howard McGillan has a great voice really, strong and perfect for broadway. The rest of the cast is good too.It feature some great Cole Porter songs, and really a vibrent and beautiful score."
3,Not the style that Anything Goes was intended to be...,"Although this CD version of Anything Goes has a few more songs, I am among many who prefer the earlier version with Eileen Rodgers. Patti LuPone does shine in the 1987 cast, but I think this CD tries too hard to make the show more modern. If you prefer a more modern sound in classic Broadway musicals, go for this version. But if you want to experience Anything Goes in the style that it was intended to be, go for the earlier version. The three songs on this CD that aren't on the other version are: ""Buddie Beware"", ""There's No Cure Like Travel"", and ""The Gypsy In Me"". Of course if you are a huge lover of Anything Goes and can afford it, by all means, get BOTH CDs!"
5,it's de-lovely!,"I love this cast-- Patti Lupone is always a knock out, and the whole thing sparkles!!"
5,What an uplifting soundtrack!,"The music is always wonderful for playing outside, inside, anywhere you can think of!"
3,"Some bits are great, but others are mediocre","This is the only version I've heard of Anything Goes, and I think the sound is fine and Lu Pone is perfect as Reno, but some bits of this I just want to skip while I'm listening to it. I really think it's worth buying, because some of the songs are fantastic, but I feel that some of the other songs just weren't meant to be sung like this. I like Howard McGillin at the beginning, especially in 'You're the Top', but when he starts to sing all the romantic songs, he turns all sappy. This would normally be good, but it's like a sickening sappy. It happens with Anne Francine too. One moment she'll be singing with this great voice, and then go all high-pitched with an over-acted sweetness. Seriously, a shiver ran down my spine the first time I heard her sing 'Goodbye, Little Dream', and not a good shiver either.Buy this if you want to, because it's still a great CD, but don't expect too much from anyone but Patti Lu Pone. Is there anything she can't do?"
3,Munchkin DOra the Explorer,"Super cute toy. They're a bit small but just fine for bath time. My niece loves Dora, so this was a perfect little gift for her."
5,great purchase from Amazon.,These bath toys are wonderful for small children. My granddaughter is a special needs child and small for her age and these fit her hands beautifully. They are soft rubber so no sharp points or edges. They are just right.
3,Cute for kids that love Dora,"Cute product for toys for the bathtub or the pool, but don't expect water to squirt out of them because it doesn't work, but they do float in the water."
1,"Small toys, big price","Well, lesson learned. I should have read the reviews. So, now I too am disappointed. These toys are so small they are practically a chocking hazard. What a shock when I saw them. If the price was $3.99 ... ok... but at $7.99 I feel ripped off and beyond disappointed."
1,Cute but too small and too pricey,"These are cute toys, but unfortunately i didn't read the reviews before hand. They are tiny, with shipping and handling it cost me $10.98 for four tiny bath tub toys. Its not worth returning them, what with paying the return shipping, but I definetly wouldn't suggest them. So cute but WAY too pricey for the size of product."
1,DON'T BUY,THESE SQUIRTERS ARE VERY VERY SMALL :-(. I WAS EXPECTING THEM TO BE A LOT LARGER FOR THE PRICE. SO DISAPPOINTING.
4,Great Product,I have bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. They arrived on time and were sealed. I know my daughter will enjoy.
5,Dora Addiction,My daughter will love to add these to her bath collection. She absolutely loves Dora and Diego and their crew!
5,Very cute,"Our kids love these toys and they're painted very well and extremely colorful. The only issue, as any parent knows with these squirter toys, is that the holes are in really strange places, making it extremely difficult to get the water out."
3,Disappointed,"I guess I was hoping these bath squirters were going to be a little larger. My one year old loved them, however, my 4 year old was not as satisfied. They are somewhat difficult to squirt and do not really float upright."
3,"Cute, but useless.","3 stars vs. 2 because our girls love them (and that's all that matters to them). As squirt toys, however, they're useless.- They don't hold much water.- The plastic is relatively weak, so they don't fill well. This isn't helped by the fact that 3 of the 4 toys don't have much squeezable space (the seahorse is the rock-star squirt toy of the group).- The squirt holes aren't all in predictable places, so you might go to squirt your child on the tummy and end up squirting them in the eye (yes, it happened, no it wasn't traumatic).- Due to the odd position of some of the squirt hoes, It's virtually impossible to get all of the water OUT of the toys when bathtime is over. The inevitable result is that you *will* be creating a science experiment inside the toys unless you go to the trouble of regular sanitization."
3,Cute but small,These are cute...your typical bath squirters. My 1 year old likes them but they are very small...about the size of a golfball. He has other bath squirters that are bigger and easier to use and I thought these would be bigger than they are.
2,Bath Toys So So,"They're cute & that's all I say. They fall over don't squit well. Plus, the pait chips really bad & I didn't have them that long! They are not a must have!"
2,Too Hard to Press,"I loved the fact that the squirters were Dora, but for me being an adult I had a hard time filling up the squirters with water and pressing them to squirt. The squirters were too hard to use."
3,Cute but Stinky,"The bath squirters are cute, but the plastic bag that came with it had a potent smell. It didn't suit well with the parents of the one year old child I bought this for. The parents said that hopefully with time the smell will go away."
3,just the right one,"it's his first ever single and it's awsome! especially the mystica mix, u just can't help dancing with the song, and the lyric is just right, this is the first song i fell in luv with and still more to go, he has some range to improve! anyway, good start!"
5,Dagnabbit!,"Okay, so this model, or actually addition to a larger model, is great. It is very solid, and once painted it looks great. But when you buy this, make sure you have a couple extra of each plane. For example, wile building or setting the planes up on your Enterprise, Nimitz, or other 1/350 scale diorama or ship, be VERY CAREFUL.These planes are delicate. Especially the landing gears. THESE ARE NOT TOYS!!!! If you are thinking about getting them for your cousin/child/nephew/niece who is interested in planes and wants to play with them, this isn't for them. Get them a matchbox plane. These are great for model builders, though! The clear canopies are AWESOME! I just finished the1/350 USS Enterprise Carrierand i wish that I had gotten these for it. Now that I'm working on the1/350 USS Nimitz CVN68 '75I am looking forward to the final look of both of them together. All in all, this is a great plane, and a great buy!!"
2,Home Medical Advisor,"When this product was first released it was very state of the art and informative. However, it has not been updated or improved in about 15 years, which makes it pretty obsolete for this day in age. You may want to research more and perhaps buy a more current medical program."
4,Goodnight cocoa,"This is a comforting drink to sip in the evening. While I haven't noticed it helping me to sleep, it certainly doesn't rev me up like a cup of coffee would. It's a sweet treat while reading or watching TV."
3,Average,This costume was chosen by our school swim team coach. I was disappointed by its quality. I don't imagine that its going to last very long.
1,TOO TIGHT ON THE LEGS,"I bought this for a kid, the waist was fine in fitting. While trying it on the boy found that his legs began to feel discomfort and his blood circulation felt cut off. VERY BAD SELECTION... SIZES ARE NOT THE BEST FOR TALL KIDS!"
5,Christmas gift,This item arrived promptly and in excellent condition. Mancini lovers will love this. Beautiful waltzes and a great tango on it.
3,"rug is ok, for price paid","not the greatest, seems a little flat at times, but it was cheap and not that bad."
5,Aquatics Compete Kit/Great Value,"This Kit is ideal for any Aquarium lover, especially Salt Water enthusiast. It has all the basic test Kits you will need to water analysis. If you priced out buying each test from one of the other manufacturers you would spend easily $170 or more. Then you would not have a neat place to keep them all. Though the quantities of each test is probably less than what you would get from others. The only other test I had to buy for my Reef Aquarium is Iodide, Magnesium, Copper. I don't think there is anything else I need that this kit doesn't have. The Price is just Great at $81. Hope you find this helpful. Good luck with your aquarium!"
4,"Good starter test kit, not great",This kit covers a good basic set of parameters for reef or fish only aquariums. Some of the assays are hard to interpret based on the color charts supplied.
5,Whodini's Rare Self Titled Debut,"WHODINI'S SELF TITLED DEBUT ALBUM WAS RELEASED IN 1983 ON JIVE RECORDS. IT WAS RE-RELEASED ON CD IN 1987 AND IT IS A RARE GERMAN IMPORT AND ONLY IMPORTED IN GERMANY. IT HAS ALSO BEEN OUT FOR DECADES NOW AND IT IS EXTREMELY HARD TO FIND. I HAVE BOUGHT AND FOUND THIS CD ON EBAY FOR ONLY $15.00 AND IT ORIGINALLY GOES FOR $99.99 BUT I WAS REALLY LUCKY TO FIND THAT CD.THIS CONTAINS ALL THEIR HIT SINGLES SUCH AS THE HALLOWEEN CLASSIC ""THE HAUNTED HOUSE OF ROCK"" ""RAP MACHINE"" ""MAGIC'S WAND/IT'S ALL IN MR.MAGIC'S WAND"", ""NASTY LADY"" ""UNDERGROUND"" AND THE SINGING CLASSIC ""YOURS FOR A NIGHT"". WHODINI GETS A LOT OF RESPECT FOR THIS RARE ALBUM BECAUSE THIS IS WHEN HIP HOP/RAP MUSIC WAS ALL ABOUT HAVING FUN AND FEELING GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF. SO PICK UP'S TO BROOKLYN'S FINEST EMCEES ECSTASY,JALIL HUCTHINS, AND DJ GRANDMASTER DEE. AND ALSO PICK UP'S TO THEIR FORMER DANCERS FROM THE ANOTHER CLASSIC RAP GROUP U.T.F.O.'S DOCTOR ICE AND THE KANGOL KID. BROOKLYN 4 EVER!"
4,excellent exercises,"This disk includes the most basic of exercises and does not have any ""flash"" to it, but having played guitar a few years myself, I can testify that the author is ""right on the money"" when stressing relaxation, breathing and enjoyment of the instrument -- these are extremely important topics and most teachers do not mention this in private lessons (since who wants to hear about breathing at $50 per hour?) In addition to the basics, there is a most comprehensive coverage of alzapua, tremolo and a few types of rasqueados. Excellent disk -- well worth the money."
4,This CD affirms me,"It took a few listens for this to begin to click with me, but now I listen to it all the time. A friend describes this (disparagingly) as ""the Monkees on Steroids,"" but I say ""Yeah! Exactly!"" The lyrics creep up on you and make you smile; the musicianship is powerful and delightful. A perfect name for the album. Sit in the yard, get a glass iced tea, and crank this dude up. Life is good! (Incidentally, I give the album 4 1/2 stars. I would only give maybe 20 albums total, ever, a full five.)"
4,"Their best album, from what I can tell","I don't have all of AIS' albums, but of the three I either own, or have owned, this one's much better than ""Tone Soul Evolution"" and TONS better than ""World Inside the Moone,"" which I turned right around and sold about two weeks after buying it (read my review of it!).This album does sound original, not too derivative of the sunny 60s, and is a helluva lot of fun. It sounds a LOT like Let's Active to me as well -- Schneider's vocals are almost dead-on Mitch Easter. The only flaws, as with other Apples albums, are that I'm not too fond of Hilarie's vocals, and there were a few times when I was listening to the album that I forgot I was listening to it; that is, I sort of tuned out.""Dots 123"" is my favorite song on the album, by the way. A FUN blowout!!"
3,Ugggh.. The smell....,I'm sure it works.. and I really wanted to like this one. But it really smells bad and you smell like Soy sauce as soon as you are done using it.... It was in the trash can on the first day. Stains and stinks up everywhere... Since the ingredients are so simple.. you can get the same effect by using some things in your kitchen without smelling of soy sauce...
1,Don't bother,"I THOUGHT that this would be a creamy, rich moisturizing conditioner. Instead it was almost pure vinegar.Unless you are planning on putting it on a salad - DO NOT BUY IT."
5,Kids & I were enthralled!,I read this to my kids. We loved it. It is very well illustrated. This is great for kids above age 7.
3,Good Information,"This book is well written and contains a lot of useful information. However, it is a bit outdated and a new edition would cover the many current issues in this field."
2,spread too thin,"I'm perplexed that this encyclopedia managed to go through four editions, considering how brief and unhelpful its entries are. Most of them are only 50 to 100 words in length. And rather than pick and choose some topics to explore in more depth, the editors decided to give everything shallow coverage.Worse, they don't even use those few words per entry wisely. Instead of giving the essential facts, they go for obscure details that will only mean something to people who are already familiar with the subject. This defeats the purpose of a general-use encyclopedia -- to introduce a subject and give the reader some basic understanding. Even my paperback New American Desk Encyclopedia surpasses this work by that standard, though it has less entries.I do not recommend this book."
4,"This is how I ""discovered"" Clannad","Got this ""LP"" (yeah, remember vinyl? ) as a gift. I have since purchased it in CD. Up to that point I had never heard of them. I was mesmerized by the freshness of the sound, the murky yet ethereal lushness of the harmony, the totally unique sound and feel. I have since purchased most all subsequent releases. Maybe because it was my first exposure to them, maybe because it was a little less formulated, this release remains the standard that I compare them to. Subsequent endeavores have been worthy and welcome additions to my collection, but they somehow have not matched the impact of this collection... as such I consider ""Macalla"" a Clannad ""must have""..."
4,good for the good times and bed times..,very nice introdacion indeed.. but its shurley have a bad side too.. i have the lp... and the second side..isnt so great..but its realy fun album.. great spirit.. :)
5,A Mobile DJ's dream come true,"As a Mobile DJ space is a major concern. Since converting over to CD's, I found that my biggest problem was the jewel cases. They would break, fall apart, and they were too big. Ever since I converted over to these sleeves I have tripled my space and reduced the weight of my CD cases by 50%. These are the best CD sleeves ever! I recommend them to all mobile DJ' in the world."
3,Okay...but could be better!,"These sleeves are pretty sturdy...but doesn't fit two cd's comfortably, like how the descrition says. One cd fits fine, but once you put a second one on the other side, you have to force it in. It also isn't thin...it almost looks like a plastic case for a cd single. And the cd sleeve is black, not white...which is what I was expecting from the look of the picture."
1,These aren't sleeves!,When I got this product I was so [angry]. These just aren't sleeves. THey are mini-boxes. Don't buy them if you just want something you can give your friends CDRs in.
4,Useful Information on Business Intelligence,"Not meant to be a Unified Field Theory of management, though it does bring intelligence and its application to business and management. Some interesting business cases that we can all learn from."
3,Expensive and not as comfy,"as the Peda Bella ones. They're very cushy, these kind of shrink up and I don't know what's up with the dots. They're made out of some polyester/cotton stuff or something and I prefer my socks as cotton as possible. Also, you need to wash them in a lingerie bag - all the half socks! Or you will never, ever see them again. The washer thinks they are very juicy indeed."
1,Wish it worked better.,Not happy with the product. It wants to slip off my foot. I really had high hopes because this is the second clog sock I have purchased and I can't seem to find one that won't slip off my foot.
4,good,"i bought them for my Toms, moccasin, Sperry.. they are compy!!! doesnt look like you r wearing socks but ya, goood"
2,not what I thought it would be,"The product states that it is made with 70% cotton28% nylon and 2% spandex. I thought with all the cotton, (the reason why I ordered it) that these socks would be soft. They are very scratchy, so I won't be ordering more of them."
4,Nifty,"Cool socks. Funny thing is, 3 days before I knew these existed I had just cut up some old socks to make footies like this.... go figure."
3,Sense of Reality?,"I have just finished reading this book and found it - well, unreal in a sense. As other reviewers have noted, keeping abreast of the different characters and their literary offerings involves some mental agility, but that is not my problem with this novel. Rather it's the fact that almost all the Purple Circle writers are variously described as beautiful demi-gods in their younger years which to me lends a sense of unreality to the whole novel, it becomes dull, when you read about yet another character, who is beautiful and who in the heady days of their youth while living in Manhattan, could 'score' with whoever they wished. A little more reality perhaps would lend the novel, and indeed Like People in History, a little more relevance and credibility I think. It's an interesting book, but I find many of the reviews in the wider media somewhat over exuberant."
2,I'm sorry...,"...But I just can't truly recommend this book. I as very excited when I found an autographed copy of this book in A Different Light (The gay bookstore), but I was so disappointed by it. I felt it was contrived, difficult to read, and written as if someobne was just trying to be brilliant!I am a huge fan of Felice Picano! Do NOT get me wrong. Like People in History, and Late in teh Season are two of my favorite books.I just feel like this one was a misfire.It will not stop me from reading more of his works, in fact I have already ordered at least three or four more.He is still damn brilliant!"
2,I'm sorry...,"...But I just can't truly recommend this book. I as veryexcited when I found an autographed copy of this book in A DifferentLight (The gay bookstore), but I was so disappointed by it.

4,"Superb, with some caveats","I found this book totally absorbing; stayed up all night to finish it. Some reviewers think it's a roman a clef, but the inside stuff is lost on us Philistines. I thought the book was put together well and the ending is a stunner! However, Mr. Picano should know that he is poorly served by his publisher. The book is filled with typos (possessive it's; O'Henry for O. Henry, etc.) and was so poorly copy-edited that readers are unnecessarily slowed down. He's a good enough writer to deserve one of the major publishers, I think."
3,Good - But Not His Best,"For readers of the Violet Quill, this book will hold your interest. Although you may be distracted by trying to figure out who all the characters may or may not be. There is a heavy dose of academic/publishing world insider trivia that seems a bit unnecessary. Otherwise, it's an interesting read. Still, I pine for the nostalgia of The Men Who Loved Me."
3,An enjoyable read,"Quite well written, this book is a pleasant read without really setting the world on fire. I found some of the plot lines a bit of a stretch to believe, but on the whole I enjoyed it."
3,nice romance,"The writing is fine and the story is a little different, not totally forgettable. If you are a romance fan you should like this. The cover is a little misleading though, it should show a Hollywood type mansion of the past instead of a castle."
2,If I Can't Have You...all the better!!!,"The first chapter was well written. You could feel the struggle and remorse but...I could not stay interested in the story. It took me about six evenings to get about a fourth of the way through the book...It just put me to sleep...literally. I could not force myself to finish it. I'm glad it was on sale when I bought it, but still it was not worth what I paid for it."
5,Thomas R. Tietze is a literary wonder,"Jack London's short stories are well-written and adventurous. I enjoyed them thoroughly. However, the introductions to each section by Thomas Tietze were surely the greatest introductions I have ever read. His concise and insightful interpretations of the text should not be underappreciated. I bought the book because of Jack London, but read the stories with greater understanding because of Thomas Tietze. Kudos to this book."
1,"One step above, or below, pulp fiction","Most of these stories were writen for the Saturday Evening Post and later compiled in book form (the copy I have is a [older]1950s paperback, not the current pricey literary collection). Captain David Grief, called the Son of the Sun for his body's ability to tan perfectly, is a trader, entrepreneur, and adventurere in the south seas. In each of the eight episodes which comprise the book, he has a less than spectacular adventure which he solves using the combination of brawn and brain. There's not enough excitement to be true pulp fiction, and the stories are too slow in developing to interest youthful readers, so it begs the question: who comprises the intended readership? I read them because they were writen by London, and as such are well crafted, even if boring. Unlike many of his other works, I won't be reading this one again."
4,the eagles gift - how to dream your way to freedom.,The eagle's gift is the first of the casteneda series that dives the reader into the world of dreaming. Casteneda has evolved from the shaman's apprentice to being the one in charge of the party of sorcerers. His evolution leads him to dreaming practices that build upon the basic abstract cores that are outlined in his earlier books. The dreaming is actually an advanced way to further the apprentices understanding of awareness... always with the purpose of strengthening one's connecting link with intent and building a concentration on the spirit. The connecting link with intent becomes unbending intent which eventually serves as the way to total freedom. The goal is to gain the totality of one's self by nurturing one's awareness through dreaming. The fixation of attention on a solid object in quick gazes ie. to the object and away from the object is one of the preliminary techniques introduced in the eagle's gift.
3,Least favorite,"While i was inspired by all of other castaneda books (i have not yet read second ring of power) this one was my least favorite. It did not have any of the great quotes of don Juan Matus or commical actions of Don Genaro, and it was not inspiring. it did have a few interesting parts here and there, but overall was kinda [crummy] compared to his other books"
1,The sham shaman rides again!,"Most people should know by now that Don Juan is an invention of Castaneda's febrile imagination.It seems some folk prefer the tepid bath of illusion to the bracing sea of reality.One of Don Juan's techniques in this book is to hang from the ceiling in a harness for much of the time over a period of six months.Pull the other one, Carlos!If people want the real thing, they should read about genuine shamans such as Black Elk and Lame Deer."
2,Can't Do Many Tricks!,"yo you can't do many tricks. this game is very hard. You can't do anything. Almost all you can do is an Indy, Ollie, Method and that's like the only tricks you can do."
3,"Good Writing, Flat Characters and a Foreshortened Story","The writing is very good although the characters are virtually identical and barely developed. Nothing really happens; it never really gets going. And then it just stops. It is quite short and reads like a thirty-chapter book of which only eight or ten chapters were published before someone stamped ""The End"" on it."
2,Bedtime Stories for Adults,"One of the charms of the ""No 1 Ladies Detective Agency"" books is that they have a gentle feeling not normally associated with mysteries. That mood is very compatible with the traditional African society Mma Ramotswe is part of. That same pacing and charm is used to advantage in ""44 Scotland Street"" as well. It's engaging to have a Bridget Jones-like character's tale told in such a detached, avuncular way.McCall Smith brings that gentility to these short stories about three German professors. The professors live an insular, old-fashioned existence and these stories describe their awkward encounter with the world. Although the professors experience physical injury (for example, in a duel where the unfortunate bookish student has never held a sword before) we aren't asked to empathize, but merely to feel bemused.If you don't expect too much from these stories, you can enjoy them one by one before nodding off. But they are light, and didn't really leave me craving for more."
2,Not #1 Lady's Detective Agency,I purchased all of this series and now think I was a little rash.This series for me held little of the enjoyment I found with Mma Ramotswe .
3,Featherlight and Ticklish,"A very silly, light, and quick read. Smith's formula of giving people ridiculous names relating to their heritage and then putting them in conflict leads to a quality time out, particularly for those who have made much dealing with academia."
3,very different from his other works,"I bought this because I loved the botswana series. This is so different in tone that it's as if it's from a different author. Not bad, just radically different."
2,Book Built Around One Joke,"I love Alex McCall Smith's stuff, but this is pretty lightweight. There is one very funny line and premise, but it could have been delivered in a 3 page short story. If he had made the misfortunes of the Professor more profound or more ironic it would make for a more entertaining series, but unlike Mme Remotswe of the Botswana books, he never really gets under the skin of the characters, puts them in interesting places, or touches on anything but the pretensions of academia."
3,I Just can't identify,"I was looking forward to this series but was sadly disappointed. The author again displayed his talent for insite into human nature but unlike the Botswana series, which I loved, I was unable to warm to the professor and other characters. Some have suggested that the setting was the reason for the success of the African series but I believe it was the likeable and real characters. This book had none of that and although I purchased the other two books in this series I likely will not read them."
3,intellectual humor,"A different kind of book, but fun none the less. Some of the humor was laugh out loud and some very subtle and some probably flew over my head. The title alone caused many raised eyebrows!!"
1,Not Wodehouse. Not even close.,"I echo those who thought this book an idiotically poor excuse for British humor. Somthing has to be ""humor"" before it can be ""British humor"".The fundamental difference between P.G. Wodehouse and Alexander McCall Smith is that Wodehouse is FUNNY. This book is not funny. Nor is it interesting, insightful, or otherwise worth your time.Much of Wodehouse is now in the public domain. Choose real laughs for free instead of paying for what might as well be blank pages."
3,Disappointed,Looking forward to a better story by Mr. Smith after reading the #l Ladies Detective Agency Series.
4,The Wacky World of German Philology Professors,"These books are more humorous than the Sunday Philosophy Club and the Botswana books, because Igelfeld and his brother professors are upright and principled, but so clueless that their progress through their narrow little lives becomes the material for comedy.They remind me of the wizards of Discworld's Unseen University, without the action, the venality, and the gluttony."
4,Barney Fife becomes a German professor,"The title of my review sums it up... stick a pretentious professor of philology in a series of European settings and watch the foolish action, to which our hero (Von Igelfeld) is oblivious. The book is a set of eight stories that are somewhat intertwined, involving the professor and his unusual friends. The best ones are the first two. I got the biggest chuckle when the 1923 edition of the rules of tennis had no provision for a tie breaker, which led the professors into total confusion. Some of the later chapters could have used a bit more humor. Throughout the book, Von Igelfeld's pride in his great book of Portuguese irregular verbs is evident."
2,It's been two months,I am still slogging through it when there is nothing else to read. Make what you will of that information
2,Could Not Finish,"I didn't find the plot interesting, I didn't find the characters interesting, and I found the pace dull-dull-dull! There was not a single thing about this book that interested me. I couldn't finish reading it.On the other hand, I do love Smith's Number-One-Ladies-Detective-Agency series and give most of those books four or five stars. I'm giving this book two stars instead of one because Smith writes well (words, sentences, paragraphs) and has created several different series, showing a wide range of creativity. But I guess that not each of his series is for everyone."
2,Irregular Verbs boring,I usually like Alexander McCall Smith but this book was boring!!! I doubt if I'll read any more in this series.
2,Not as good as his others,"I have enjoyed many of Smith's other books, especially the ""No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency"" and the Isabel Dalhousie series, but the central character of this book (and series) is pathetically boring. I cannot identify with this character at all. Perhaps if you read it and can identify, then you might like the series, but basically, it's about a bumbling kind of stupid professor."
2,Portuguese Irrreg Verbs,"Love Alexander McCall Smith, but this series is a bit too dry for my taste. Humorous character, but I felt sad for him."
4,A gentle delight,"I like the simplicity, the kindness, the gentleness, the light humor, and the respect the author pays to each character in this story. Smith, author of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective series, is not to everyone's liking. A friend, who I loaned one of the No. 1 series books, was irritated with the books. ""Nothing happens,"" she complained. I know that is true. But somehow it suits me."
1,No fun here for me,"I have not read all of the No.1 Ladies Detective Agency books yet, but have enjoyed what I have read. I, too, am surprised that the author of those warm, fun books is the same person who wrote Portuguese Irregular Verbs.I found Dr. von Igelfeld to be selfish, grating and obnoxious. None of it was in a funny way for me. I didn't even finish the book because I just couldn't tolerate the main character and won't try any others in this series."
2,Not Smith's best work,"There are funny spots in the book, but really only his ""No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency"" series is any good."
1,toilet paper!,yes i agree! you really are an irregular dumb f--k. hahaha stupid title. i also thought that this book was a reference for the portuguese language. i hope this book doesnt make a dime!
4,Great fun for bouncy ones,"My daughter loves to have this book read to her. When Didi says ""No"" and races ahead of her daddy, my daughter shouts along. Great rhythm to the text, and the illustrations are gratifying to adults as well as children. Lots of familiar things to point out, including, tragically, the north and south towers of the WTC."
4,Great Body Wash,"I'm used to using body wash from the dollar store, and when I saw this in my parent's shower, I assumed it was something expensive like what my mom usually buys. I used it and fell in love with the scent; it's not too flowery and girly like most body washes. When I discovered it at Safeway for only $4, I was stunned. This is a great body wash for the price, you will not be disappointed! So far this is the only scent that I like; the other Caress body washes have that girly flower scent to it that I can't stand."
1,Horrible Rash!!!,"I bought this body wash after smelling the wonderful tropical fragrance.Started getting a rash, thought it was from a medication I was taking. I had stopped the meds 5 weeks ago and the rash persists. Sleepless nights horrible full body rash even with a prescription creme it's almost unbearable. Hope this prevents someone else from going through this nightmare."
3,So So,"This is a selection of some of Dowland's most famous pieces performed in appropriate Renaissance style. Unfortunately, the quality of the performances is mixed. Some pieces are performed very well, others not. The singer on this CD, Catherine King, is inconsistent. In some songs, like ""Come again, sweet love..."" she is good. In others, her diction and phrasing is suspect. I may also be put off by her apparently strong Scots accent. Choice of tempi in several pieces is poor. A couple of Dowland's most famous songs are represented by instrumental versions, which are nice, but pale compared with the actual songs."
3,mediocre,"Perhaps three stars was generous, but Larnelles singing made me give it a three star instead of a two. It was somewhat informative. It left many questions by what it didn`t say. Slightly on the P.C. side and some of the graphics were cheesy. Nevertheless I didn`t consider it a waste of time only money. Not worth twenty bucks, maybe five."
4,More great industrial!,"Alright, Seabound.It's name fits the music pretty well, it's pretty driving and fast. Has kind of an oceany feel to it too. I really enjoy this CD a lot. I like it more than Beyond Flatline, excluding that my favorite song by them is ""Poisonous Friend"".So for you who might not know what industrial is, it's like heavy, dark dance music. THe vocals are usually monotonous, devoid of any emotion at all. The beats usually hit hard and are very electronic.My favorite track on this CD? The remix version of Hooked. And Donooks.They are both great tracks, and the remix version of hooked is even a bit trancy and I love that crossover sound into Trance from Industrial. I'd love to make music that sounds JUST like this. LIke RAzed in Black's ""Share This Poison"""
3,some nice melodies but weak lyrics,I was eager to listen to their debut album and I have to say I was fairly disappointed. Some of the melodies are great but a couple of the songs have pretty weak lyrics - rhymes that are completely forced and made me cringe.
3,Relatively weak Celi Bruckner,"Unlike Celi's Bruckner 4, which is stupendous and unforgettable (perhaps the most shattering 'modern' version), the 7th fares less well, and this is a surprise and a puzzle. My suspicion is that Celi was less interested in this, the most popular, and least problematic of the Bruckner symphonies. Hence, this recording, while very interesting as a document of Celi/Munich, is probably less inspiring than his earlier DG version.Doubtless fascinating to any in-depth student of Celi/Bruckner, this likely will not stand at the level of his Munich 4th or 9th. That said, it is never less than worthy of a close hearing for true Brucknerians and Celibidachians."
5,OK I'm hooked,"Had buckled at trying sudoku in papers and magazines, because I am a creature who like the old regulars, like crossword puzzles. I was waiting an inordinately long time in a doctor's office, and they had a sudoku puzzle on the wall with a wipe off pen to figure the sequences out. Curiosity got the better of me, and before the dr. came in (gasp) I had completed the thing! If you like puzzles - cryptograms, or anything that you need to put your creative/logical mind into, I think you will find this new craze fascinating!Who would have 'thunk it' that an English Lit major would do logic puzzles?But it's fun."
4,Hello .......can you say addicting.................,"Not the best Sudoku book I own, but very addicting."
2,Sudoku Easy,"Book mainly medium difficulty puzzles with a few harder ones in back. Main discontent with this book is that is has basically no info or strategies to use to learn the game. A few basics are shown, but not enough to progress as a new Sudoku player. Price is ok for contents."
3,Newer product not the same as pictured,"The Muscle soak listed in the title is correct to the product received from purchase, however the picture is of the older, pure peppermint version. Threw me off as I was specifically seeking the pure peppermint and I'd taken then ""Blend of"" part of the title to mean that the Eucalyptus and Lemongrass were minor ingredients that I had not known about last time I had owed the pictured Aromaflora Product. It might be helpful for the image to be updated correspondingly."
4,Steinmans best. Bat 2 predicessor,"I think Original sin is an incredible cd. It really gives a look at where Meat Loaf started. The songs are so incredible for any meat loaf or bonnie tyler fan. Tho' many say Celines Version of ""It's all comming back to me"" is better than Pandora's I believe you really need to take into concideration the flair for rock music and 80's sound that Steinman always incorporated into his music. I actually perfer the Pandora version. Any Rock music lover should check into this cd"
4,Good reference on the military around the turn of the century,"The U.S. Army changed significantly from a frontier constabulary to a (relatively) modern force during the period of the Boxer Rebellion, the Spanish-American War and the Philippine Insurrection. Specialty uniforms for overseas service, the adoption of a wider range of specialty badges and a recognition of the need of a more practical hat all changed the look of the military. Illustrated with contemporary artwork and photographs, this book is a great reference on the Army prior to World War One."
1,No Hush Button,"Spoke to Tech Support. There is no Hush Button on this Photoelectric model (and the Test Button does not act in this regard either).Go with the BRK / First Alert, Model 7010B, which has the Silence Feature (for up to 15 minutes).Options I was looking for:Photoelectric - This is better than Ionization, in my case, where the alarm is just outside of a bathroom - where steam can set it off (I'm replacing an AC only, Ionization. Photoelectric is less sensitive to steam). Disposing of Photoelectric detectors after 10 years is also more environmentally friendly. They do not contain americium-241, which is under the positive plate of the Ionization chamber.AC powered with 9V battery backup - The most desirable to haveHush Button - The 9V battery backup will keep the alarm going, even if you cut power at the circuit breaker box - Need to be able to silence a false alarm, without having to remove the battery."
1,No way to silence a false alarm,"I have 7 of these networked together. If one is triggered by smoke from the kitchen, they all go off, and there is no way to silence them. This is really bad design. I would never buy this model again."
1,Dangerous - Remove these from your house immediately!,"Kiddie PE120 manufactured June 3, 2010. This thing makes its own fires. Worked fine for about 1 year. Now the battery is shorted by an internal component failure, gets very hot rapidly and if allowed to continue would have set my house on fire if it hadn't happened to fail while I was home. Fortunately my other smoke alarms (BRK) were triggered by this POS. Really guys, you couldn't engineer a non-flamable fusible resistor in series with the battery? A recall is needed."
2,High rate of false alarms and failure rate,Pros: Easy to installCons: we have replaced about 12 out of 60 installed. They would sound for what seemed like no reason (no smoke or fire was present) and not reset so we had to replace them to shut them up.
1,bad design,"Just moved into our new home where 5 of these units were installed. Have has 2 false alarms, both at night. The first on scared the living you know what out of me, and the second was just annoying! Have discovered that small bugs are attracted to the light and get inside, setting one off, causing ALL of them to go off! I had to climb up and disconnect one by one until the right one was disabled. Not cool!"
4,"Great auto scanner,but...","First I would like to commend amazon on the price, this is what will get me to return to your site for future products. The cp9145 autoscanner is a great scanner, but it doesn't include all of the necessary adaptors for diffrent autos. Also I did encounter some problems when trying to connect with my older auto's system to read the check engine."
4,Quck and Easy,"Well packaged, in a vinyl zipper bag which tucks the manual and CD safely in a compartment, the unit itself is held in place with a velcro strap. It also comes with an extender interface cable to allow you to place the scanner on the passenger seat.I had a check engine light on and isolated the problem (rear O2 sensor) within minutes. Next up I need to replace it, check again and clear the code. Hopefully this will be as easy as it's been up to now.Two features I'd like to see are a contrast control for the LCD screen and a backlight for low-light use. I was checking my car after work and it was dark out. The dome light in my car worked, but with LCD screens a backlight would make better sense.[see comment for the outcome of post-replacement of the failed O2 sensor]"
2,Not for vehicles manufactured after 2003,I purchased this based upon the add that it's for vehicles 1996 and newer. It(the add) fails to mention this is probably an older scanner that only has vehicles made to and including 2003. I have a 2005 Jeep and the engine wasn't made until then. There are scanners that can be undated and that's why I had to return it.
3,only tried once,"The product was simple to use. Attached to the vehicle read the code and solved the problem. It happened to be a simple problem that I could have repaired without the scanner, but the scanner did shut off the check engine light. I do not know enough about the functions of the scanner to say more than that."
4,Actron CP9145 autoscanner,"If you are having a problem with your OBD 1 or OBD 2 car you should buy this.It will read your trouble codes and give you more info on sensors,fluid temperture and other engine data for your car.You can reset your Trouble codes.Its is easy to use but wish there was a way to print the info out or to store the data in the scanner."
4,Nice Unit,"This scanner does everything they state it will plain and simple.It's easy to use and feels solid.An excellent tool to have for someone who's not afraid to use the informationbecause you can learn a lot about your vehicle once you're plugged into it.Beware...it only comes with one cable, not the assortment shown in the image.They changed the photo, only one cable now."
1,Poor compatibility,I purchased this scan tool to use on a 1989 turbocharged and intercooled Chrysler LeBaron. This was one engine that this tool would not communicate with. Chrysler sold quite a few cars with this engine and it was completely left out of the programming. I won't buy another Actron product.
1,Beware! Outdated units are unable to read CAN protocol on new vehicles (post 2003).,"I purchased this unit based on the live test capabilities only to discover that it would not read the codes on my 2006 Honda Civic. It works on my 2005 Accord.The manufacturer confirmed by e-mail that my unit was outdated and suggested the purchase of a retrofit kit ""CP9145UA"" for $60. Subsequent phone communication lead to the identification of a code in the box that marked the CAN compatible units. At that time, Amazon stock consisted entirely of the older units, and the kit was not available from Amazon. I returned the unit."
4,"Good OBD-II, OBD-I combo scanner","Works well on both 02 Honda Accord and 95 Mazda Millenia. Originally bought this for the 1995 mazda millenia which was labeled as an OBD-I system. It turns out the 95 millenia has a non fully compliance OBD-II system that I can use same OBD-II diagnostic as the 96 MX6/626 models. I like Actron for providing both OBD-II and OBD-I capabilities for such a low price. Had no problem with reading and resetting OBD-II codes so far. I have verified grabbing and resetting diagnostic codes by pulling out connectors to oxygen, air input temperature sensors...The Actron's manual had more details and better explanation compared to AutoXray EZ Scanner 4000.If you have a 1994 or 1995 car, you should research whether your car can use non-compliance OBD-II to save money on buying cables for OBD-I.I wish Actron has used fewer SSI's (small-scaled IC) Should have used more VLSI) to make the unit smaller and cheaper."
4,Good to have,used it once.It did its job.As far as user friendly?would like to see more about how to read the trouble codes and fix them.
1,money wasted,"I bought a cp9145 to work on my 95 Caprice (which is an OBD1 car) and using it has been a very frustating experience. Including the adapter cord for obd1 cars, I paid about $230 (not from Amazon), and so far, the information it has given me has been worth about 37 cents to me. The check engine light was on and the scanner told me ""dtc 26 Output driver module fault CCP circuit"". I found out, by other means, that the problem was an electically operated valve in the Evaporative Emissions Control system. Actron does not provide any other information for OBD1 cars and did not respond to my e-mail questions. I find the manual poorly organized and difficult to use. Also, the outside of the box it came in says it has a one year warranty, but when I got it home, there was no warranty information inside the box. I have not had any trouble from my OBD2 car, so I cannot comment on that function."
