4,I love this Palm Z22.,"I have used this PDA for 2 months. I have installed a Chinese OS in the PDA, a whole bible, several dictionaries, such as English to Chinese and Chinese to English. Each dictionary has >50,000 words. I also have installed many games and applications to this PDA too. It still has some room for me to install more applications into this Palm Z22. Great PDA! Because it is simple, I do not need to worry about ""virus"". I would like to recommend this PDA to all my friends.However, its picture quality is not good! That is the only disadvantage of this PDA from my point of view!"
2,Disposable Palm,"My elderly Handspring was still going strong after many years, but I had to replace it when its software couldn't be loaded on my new computer. (Palm doesn't support the old Handspring products.) Bought the Palm Z22 and it died 1 week past its 90 day warranty. Dead as a doornail. The cost to repair? More than the purchase price. Buyer beware..."
4,Palm Review,Using the stylus to write is a little difficult until you get used to the format. Battery life is great and entering information is a snap. The menus are easy to understand and setup out of the box is super easy. Wife loves the product.
4,Palm Z22: awesome in a white cute thing.,"I got a Palm z22 for college. I have never been organized, but after losing my phone and all my numbers 3 times I decided I should try it.I love my Palm. I enter everything in on the computer, then it yells at me when I'm late/forgetful/lost. I program in addresses, directions, mailbox combinations, homework assignments, and all of a sudden I have them when I want them. It also offers very cute colors for its background, and allows me to make shopping lists on the go when I remember things.I do have to say, I don't use the photo feature at all, and the game offered on this one is ...well not too fun. It does make me want to learn how to program for the Palm OS so I can make less terrible games. Basically I have yet to use 3rd party apps, and stick only with the basics on mine.But overall, the Palm Z22 is great. I love it, it helps me be (and look) responsible, and I get a lot less lost all of the time."
5,"Simple, easy transition from paper","I was a staunch user of the day planner till I was convinced that the sync capabilities of a pda would save me time and keep everything neat, organized and at my fingertips.It's all true with the Z22. It's easy to learn and keeps everything - calender, tasks, grocery lists, etc. - organized and easy to find.The screen is nice enough color-wise and all, but not great. You gotta spend more money f you want shaper detail. For me, the price and the functionality is all I was looking for.For those that are thinking of jumping into the 21st century with their daily schedules, this is the device to start with."
2,What price simplicity?,"I would have rated the Z22 5 stars at the old price of $90-100. I cannot fathom where Palm gets off nearly tripling the price without changing the specification. Look what else you can purchase for $259! This is the end of the Z22, friends.Palm relentlessly pursues mediocrity in quality and worse in service. The Z22 had to go."
2,Bad Product,"I bought this product about nine months ago and since then have faced the following problems:a) Sometimes the unit does not start and a series of lines appear in the screen. I have to reset it to start again.b) The unit decidedly stoped working during two days; afterwards, just to see if I had any luck, I tryed again and it started. Two days afterwards it just died!!!Obviously, I do not recommend this item. Try a Sony."
1,Palm died after I entered all my information,"I got the Palm on a Friday and had lots of fun putting all my information into it. Sunday morning I had it on and the screen turned black and the Palm never woke up again. It was very sad. Amazon was great about giving me a refund even though I had already gotten rid of the proper boxes, etc. But still, I was very disappointed in the product and will stick to my old fashioned cheapo paper calendar from the mall that are offered every January."
1,let the buyer beware,"For those of you thinking on purchasing this model. Think twice. It cost me $400 to get my computer system working again. The software destroyed registry files and corrupted others. This was all after I downloaded the Palm software into my system. I was dumb enough to try this twice with regretable affects. It was all returned. I am now trying to get Palm to reimburse me for the damage done. I only got my computer back to normal after we could uninstall the software from it. Good luck for those who will take their chances, condolences for those who failed."
1,Died of overcharging (I guess),"I bought a Z22 and I left it to charge for a long period of time. It died. I am not sure what the cause is, but I got a Palm IIIxe that is performing wonderfully."
2,Can't Upgrade from M515,"I bought the Z22 to replace an M515. I guess the Palm software versions are incompatible because the handhelds will only sync with the version for the unit. Try loading the new version over the old - nothing works. Remove program, start over then retype all your information. Palm is no help."
4,Good product with defective battery,"We bought this handheld only to discover in a few weeks that the battery was bad. Rather than risk the hassles of an exchange, we bought a refurbished one as a replacement that's worked ok so far."
4,Palm Z22,"I recently bought the Palm Z22 for a present.I liked the size and color and the person that i gave the present to,loved it.So people out there looking for a Palm that will keep all their assigments and appointments dont look no more....the Palm Z22 has it all and for the price it comes with much more......"
4,Works great for what I need!,"Palm Z22 HandheldSome of the things are a little small but it works great for what I need it for, calendar and contacts.Some of the instructions aren't clear. The calendar always starts in the year 2005 and I still haven't figured out how to change that, but otherwise it was pretty self explanatory."
5,Palm Z22,My previous PDA suddenly went dead. I looked for a reasonable cost replacement and found the Z22. It not only was reasonable but offered features more advanced than my previous PDA.
4,Very smart.,I carry it with me at all times and have better control of my schedule. It was well worth the money. Syncs easily.
3,Palmn vs Windows Vista,"I just bought a Palm Z22. The software that comes with the machine is not compatible with Windows Vista. Each time I tried to install it, I received an error message. I finally called Palm, who informed me that I needed to go to the Palm support site and download the software for Windows Vista. There is nothing on the packaging that indicates that you need to go online for the software. Also the Vista link does not download any of the subsidary files such as photosharp.Palm Z22 Handheld"
1,reconditioned?,"This product was sold as reconditioned. After checking it out against the new model, nothing seem to been done to bring it back to anything close to resembling the new model. In the future having a list of what was done would make this a more tolerable sale. Because the pricepoint was not terrible, the loss was easier to justify. ""Reconditioned"" needs a better discription."
2,Returned,"The Palm Pilot was returned to Palm.The item, when turned on displayed a date of 2001.Needless to say the battery was shot...as opposed to trouble shooting the item had to returned to Palm for replacement.Palm was very good at the exchange though."
3,Palm Z22,"I am very disappointed in the Palm Z22 programing, particularilly the in the Tasks section where the 'due date' cannot be entered correctly. It continually comes up --/--/2031, even if you enter 'No Date' on the computer. I have called Palm and there explanization was that it was ""inherent to the system""!"
2,Listed as new but defective,"The Z22 was listed as new but it would not function correctly. All of the shiping and delivery of the unit were right on time. I have owned two Z22's in the past and am very familiar with how one should operate. A correctly functioning Z22 is easy to use and lets you look at info while using a cell phone. It hung up on one screen and the touch screen was unresponsive to any input by the stylus. Tried several resets. It would not sync with the software that loaded on a computer. The price may have been lower, but the product was not what it should have been. The seller did respond to my email, but I would be reluctant buy from this seller again. Amazon did its part in contacting the seller and arranging for return."
2,ok but,it is the palm but the other owner left stuff on it and I can't get it off. guess I shouf have bought new.
4,Palm Pilot,"A handy device. Too bad they won't make newer versions.Now you have to buy a phone with the attendant costs.I have 2 Palm Pilots, one as a spare when this one wears out."
3,Palm Z22 Handheld,"Used Handheld Palm, good enough condition; Would have appreciated the owners deleting their data prior to sending it. I expected it to be clean of data upon receiving it.Other than that all the items were included with the Palm (eg charger,etc) as stated in the ad. Would purchase again if I needed another one in the future. Basic Palm foruse of names and address information which is mostly what I use it for."
3,small screen long wait,"The product has basic and adequate features. The screen is rather small and makes reading it difficult for us far-sighted, short armed persons:) The shipping time was very disappointing, around 2 weeks for an in stock item is not what i expect from companies trying to do business over the internet. With that kind of wait, i don't think i would do it again."
5,Z22,"This is the fourth device I have had in the Palm family. They get better every time. I am delighted with the interface, and just in general with how it operates."
4,Good Handheld,Great Handheld. Only problems are that its not upgradeable and you cant see the screen well outside. But overall its great
2,I thought I found the right organizer...,"I have used Plams since 1998, been up and down with different Palm models - Had the Zire 72 last and found all I really needed was the calendar and address book. Z22 seemed just right when my Z72 went to the shop for repairs or battery or something. Put my calendar on the new little palm (love the funky rubber slip covers) and missed my first meeting when the alarm went off and I did not hear it. It took me two minutes to figure out that with or without the cover on, on low, medium or high, the ALARM ON THIS THING IS NEARLY INAUDIBLE. I am dissapointed - what a stupid design flaw. Or maybe the speaker on this one is broken. I don't dare send it to Palm for repairs if it is (if you don't knw why, read others experiences below). Anyway, it cost me $100 to get a machine that doesn't meet my needs. I am glad it wasn't $300 or $400."
1,Palm follows the typical spiral in quality,"I owned a Palm Vx and loved it. Unfortunately it finally died, which I suppose, after 7 or 8 years, was inevitable. I bought a Z22 and hated it from the start.1. They changed the writing styles for the text for the worse. Probably as a result of their lost patent suit with Xerox.2. Even though color was an upgrade for me, the resolution, and hence text quality was much worse.3. After a few months (past the 90 day warranty), it completely died.This last complaint, while disapointing to me that I'm out $100, actually frees me from the torment of this unit, so I can buy something that has actually improved over time.Alot of tech companies build great products when they startup, as Palm did. Unfortunately, the pattern many follow is that the bean counters eventually take over to drive cost out of development and unit cost, thereby driving down quality. In my limited experience, this appears to be what has happened to Palm."
1,Non-working item,"Arrived in sealed new packaging, but was inoperable. Returned promptly.Still awaiting credit/refund from Amazon."
4,Works great,"I drowned my old Palm M100 and put off getting a new one for several months. I learned that once you are used to organizing your life with a Palm it is hard to live without one. I didn't want something with a lot of bells and whistles. Just basic address book and calendar. This Palm does just what I want with ease. I set it up to sync with my Outlook in just a matter of a few minutes. It synced without problems the first time. I would recommend this Palm to anyone who is tired or writing down everything more than once. Someone who wants an easily portable calendar and address book. Also, because I have a copy of my calendar and address book on both the Palm and my computer it's backed up should I lose one or the other."
2,Over prized-terrible resolution-annoying,"Palm changed their Graffiti hand writing language and it is so frustrating to have to re-learn a language that worked fine for 10 years. I am now looking at Blackberry and other PDAs which is a shame because I have been a Palm user for over 10 years. Bye Palm, the z22 put me over the top."
3,It Crawls!,Everything was supposedly perfect with this Palm until I installed MyBible and it crawled everytime I opened it!
1,Ridiculous...,"I recently purchased a Palm z22 and was very excited about getting my life a bit more organized. Unfortunately the z22 was dead on arrival. The best part is that neither the Palm OR the AC adapter work. I was able to test my AC adapter with a friend's z22 because I thought this was the problem. As I assumed, the AC adapter didn't charge her z22. Then I tried her AC adapter with my Palm This did not work either! I'm waiting for a response from Palm. Is there no quality assurance? I'm baffled."
1,"Software freezes, can't reload software","This was a total waste of money. I loaded the software on my desktop, which worked for about a month. The Palm inself works, but the software freezes on the computer and I have to shut down the computer to do anything else. I removed the software from the computer and the disk which came with this worthless device won't allow me to re-install. And, to make matters worse, there are no downloads for this device from Palm. A total waste of money. The identical thing happened on my boss' computer. We have the same problem and the Palm Z22 is of no use to either of us without the desktop softare to sync with."
4,Addiction in a small blue and white wrapper,"I grew up with these. They're a total chewy, sweet and salty addiction. You might find yourself eating half a dozen in a row. There's a large seed inside you chew around and spit out. Sometimes you get a pack that's nice and juicy and fresh, sometimes they're a bit hard and small and dried out, depending how long they've been off the boat I suspect, but still pretty good - they vary just like dried fruit varies. I also like the other varieties you can get, preserved lemon peel etc. Sold at most Chinatown type shops."
3,"OK, But Texas Has Issued a Recall Due to Lead Levels","I had eaten about half a bag of these (over the course of several days) before doing a search that happened to include the Food and Drug Administration, where I learned that the Texas Health Department has issued a warning for these specific plums, along with several other brands, out of concern for high lead levels. Here is the link. [...] They are not specific as to lot numbers, but there is no question in my mind that what is listed on Amazon is what is covered by the recall. I'm sending a copy of this review to Amazon and the grocery, and will update as needed."
4,"great knives, need better block","I very much like the knives. They are extremely sharp, ergonomic and handle very easily. It is a breeze to clean them as there are no seams or crevices to dig food out of. The attached sharpener is easy to use, and is adaptable to the other insertable levels that come in the sharpening kit (three step kit not included).Only two downsides, the block is part aluminum and part plastics, it really should be wood. And I would like to have the 5"" santoku rather than the larger chef's knife, but that just my own preference."
4,customer service great,"the knives are not what I expected but the seller has been great, they amke a professional version and that is what I thought these were. These are lighter weight and only one is coppertail."
1,Sorry to say...,"This was a nice looking watch and my son, who is a dedicated Penguins fan, was very happy with it. Unfortunately after about two months the sweep second had fell off and is just rattling around inside the watch. Unfortunately I will have to pay $15 to repair a $25.00 watch. Forced to give it one star."
5,A Compelling Page Turner!!,"Silent Revenge is an extremely well-written work, masterfully detailed and designed to keep you reading from cover to cover! A book, with a plot that holds many surprises, which continue to unfold through to the end. You won't put it down until you've devoured every last word!"
1,Don't confuse with sound trackfrom Aus.movie 'Heavens Burnin,Unfortunately I purchased this CD thinking it was the soundtrack. Even though Amazon shows this title when you search -soundtracks-. I think I would be hard pressed to even give it away definetly not my kind of music. The soundtrack I wanted was for an Australian Movie 'Heaven's Burning'
5,Perfect,"Used for my Polaris Ranger, fit good, very sturdy, may slide on the rail if not tight enough or if to much force is used."
4,Expensive but good,These Hand Holds work great in my Polaris Ranger. The only complaint is that are a bit pricy for the materials and construction.They are a good addition to your vehicle to get in and out of it.
1,Making this one dissappear,"My mother-in-law bought this for our son (now 2) and I just pulled it out last week as he's into ""paper"" page books now (moving up from the board books). I was stunned to discover in the end that Goldilocks ends up in the pie in the end. I'm not into the Grimm type of story books...so this one will be leaving my son's library before he knows better and gets scared by it. It's the first book I've ever objected to for him. I would pass for any age child."
3,interesting for a beginner,"I bought the book because of the good reviews, but was a bit disappointed. It was a nice overview of levels of shop equipment, but it was really geared towards the beginner. If you're building the 3 or 4 stage shop described in the book, you probably won't get anything new out of it."
3,Interesting but not really instructive,"The only real contents of this book is Amie Frasier's opinion on the order in which you should buy things for your workshop, which could be accomplished in a page or two. The other books in this series contain projects and skill builders, but this book completely lacks any activities whatsoever.Basically, this book is just a series of short descriptions of the different common woodworking tools - something you can easily find online although you probably already know as much as this book will tell you.The editing of the book is remarkably poor (similar to other books in the series) with many mistakes, a few cut off sentences, and pictures that are either incorrect, or are cropped so poorly that they cut off what they are trying to illustrate."
2,Very basic,"This book is good if you need a list of the different tools it's possible to buy for a workshop, but otherwise you should pass it up and buy something else. Don't expect to learn how to use them or any workshop tips. You can find about the same information in a woodworking catalog, and they would be free. Save your money and buy a good compilation issue of WOOD magazine or one of the many other books available on Amazon."
2,Not adjustable enough,"These speaker stands are well constructed and attractive (in a very industrial kind of way.) However, their height is not adjustable. This is ok for front speakers, but you want rear surround speakers to be a bit above you. So they really don't work. You would mount rear speakers above you on the wall, but don't buy these for rear speakers. Also, Wharfedale appears to have difficulties getting their screws set up appropriately since it was a serious pain to get on of the stands attached to the base."
4,"This cd is so-so,just not like volume 10 was.","21 songs i like out of 27I especially like 12 songs from this cdThe 6 songs i don't care for are,and this is only my opinion:Gimme A Little Kiss,Will Ya Huh/Michael Landon)At times hard to hear dialogSilhouettes/Steve Gibson And The Red Caps)Herman And The Hermit's version better.You Need Hands/Eydie GormeTrust In Me/Patti PageMojo Workout/Larry BrightAbraham,Martin And John/Moms Mabley)Didn't like this version at all-Dion version better."
5,Fantastic!,"There is not a weak track on this delightful new recording, a combination of West African, Delta acoustic and Reggae roots music. They flow together in a soothing and uplifting way, a blend of playful songcraft and masterful instrumentation. Corey Harris, like fellow Coloradan Otis Taylor, is the real thing - making modern music firmly rooted in the African/Delta acoustic blues sound. This is the music to cure all your blues and make you whole."
5,The best MDO recording for the Spanish language impaired.,"Also and maybe more important, this MDO cd has superior sound mastering. Baila never sounded better and louder than the version that appears here. This cd is completely worth the import price."
1,WARNING : may not stay together.,"The entire watch movement fell out of the band. If you look closely, you can see that the band sort of holds the watch movement snug - for a while, at least. We are out $35 with a watch that lasted less than 3 months. What can I say? In a lifetime of owning TIMEX watches, this has been the largest disappointment of all."
1,Lasts 3 months max,"I have used Timex sport watches all my life, but got disappointed with this one. I have had it for about 3 months now, and the indigo light stopped working. I changed the battery but nothing happened. A week after the light stopped working, the sound is gone too. So no alarm anymore. As I mostly use the watch as an alarm and to jog at night (I need the light), it is now useless. Never should have bought it."
4,Ironman Sleek Watch,"I love it it was a little intimdating at first with all of it's features, but after reading the instructions that came with the watch I was able to set the time. I haven't used all of it's features yet the watch is very high tech, but I do train with it on all the time and looking foward to utilizing some of its main features for using it. I will be in a triathlon on 9/11 and plan to have it on and train with it now so that I will be prepared then.Last night was the first time I took the watch off since I purchased it this past July so not bad. I noticed this morning a small red rash on my wrist probably because it was time for me to take it off:) If you have sensitive skin and train like I have 6 days a week. Make sure to wear it loose and / or take it off from time to time."
1,Despite nthe System,"This book sheds little light on the Hollywood scene in Welles times and contains little on Welles' personal life or makeup. Rather it supplies endless, scene by scene trivia on how Welles saw his dramas develop. A good book for a collegiate motion picture major but a bore for the general public."
4,Historical Fcition,"This book is an interesting read, but laced with fictional accounts of the authors imagination. I picked it up to research a masters thesis, and became frustrated trying to separate fact from fiction. If you are reading for pleasure and have an interest in German Signals Intelligence during WWII this is a good book."
3,Not up to Rozhdestvensky's usual standard,"As much as I love Rozhdestvensky's Nielsen symphony set (I gave it five stars), I have trouble recommending this. The key work here, the Helios Overture, is rather slow and plodding, with a timing of about 14 minutes as opposed to 12 for even the slowest of other versions. I believe the finest set of Nielsen overtures and concert pieces is Jarvi's on DGG, with good to excellent sound and performances that never disappoint."
1,Killed my back and shoulders,I thought this was a great idea at first when my daughter was first born. I was able to nurse her in the sling and carry her around the house doing chores while she slept. I love all the cute patterns and that its washable. But once she got bigger it killed my back and neck. I wish there was padding on the shoulder area for Mom. But if you have any neck/back/shoulder problems stay away.I wish I could have used it more.
5,Great product,I had a friend recommend the Hot Sling to me and I absolutely love it. Unlike other slings my baby does not fall down super low and become engulfed in the sling. She loves to be with me and with the sling I am able to get things accomplished at home. My husband even wears it sometimes and loves how comfortable it is to wear. I highly recommend this product for all mothers.
5,Worth every Penny!,I got the Hotsling for my Daughter who lives in Germany She really likes the versatility for our new baby/ Grandson when he is snuggled close to her body without feeling as if he might fall out. We had purchased other baby Carriers but they would only support the baby in an upright position thus making the baby less comfortable and you can't use them very long either only until the baby is 30 Lbs so less than 6 months. We decided to give the sling a try and it is the best idea anyone has come up with in a long time. The sling is very versatile because you can use them from birth until your little ones grow to be a toddler. We all know what it was like to have a fussy baby on your hip and your arm feeling as if it might just fall off. This Sling allows you the ease to move around and shop with your hands and arms free to pick things up. Yes it was a little pricey but I feel it was worth every penny. Proud Grandma from Hawaii!
3,Fit great but irritated my daughter's skin,"I love the fit of pampers versus huggies but these particular diapers gave my 3 year old a rash where the special feel 'n learn liner was in the diaper. Could be that it doesn't breathe as well as the other fabric in order to accomplish the whole ""feeling wet"" sensation. My daughter also never commented on feeling wet...at least no more than she usually would comment so I'm not sure how effective they would have been if I'd continued using them."
2,OK IF SWAPPED...REGULAR USE..BEWARE DIAPER RASH,"I have been using the feel N learns for my nearly 3 year old inorder to train her, from the time she was 6 months up until now she's not been prone to diaper rash. I recently switched from mainly diapers and pullups once in a while to using pullups regularly. only to end up with the realization that she'd gotten a rash from these particular pullups. I believe this is brought on due to the lack of air flow and the fact that toddlers tend to hold in their urine longer which makes it more concentrated when they pee (concentration = Harmful) and so it irritates the skin the liner holds it on to the skin, she's not at the point where she regularly warns anyone to the fact that she's gone to the bathroom. While the concept is nice I'd say these are good for every once in a while use but definitely not 24 hour use."
4,Why Discontinued?,I use these faithfully and now they are discontinued. And why is Amazon asking for a review if they are discontinued?
3,"Ok, but nothing great","I thought I'd try these after my daughter started using the potty more often in an attempt to move away from diapers altogether. I found these to be ok but not any better than Easy Ups. As others have mentioned, my daughter never commented on feeling wet any more than with diapers or Easy Ups. If you just like the convenience of pulling something up instead of diapering, try Easy Ups first. They're cheaper (sometimes moreso than Cruisers) and just as good as these in my opinion."
2,Waste of money.,I think pull ups and easy ups are just a marketing ploy by the diaper companies to get our kids wearing diapers longer. They allow parents to feel like we are doing something to potty train without really doing anything. We bought these with the wetness liner to train our daughter. Didn't work. At just past 2 she was smart enough to know that it was just another diaper. Toddlers are smarter than we give them credit for. We used the whole box and then I switched her to real underwear. She had accidents for about a week and then realized that she had to get to the potty or get soaked. That was the end of potty training. The reason I gave this product 2 stars is because I do like them for car trips and a few other instances where getting to the potty quickly is going to be a problem.
1,Think twice before purchasing,"The chamber where you place the popcorn kernels becomes jammed during air popping. The vents, located in the bottom of the hot air popper are at a 45 degree angle (should be a 90 degree angle) and becomes jammed by kernels as they pop. That causes the air popper to stall out. At that point it needs to be unplugged and the jammed popcorn pried out of the machine with a knife. This was an expensive popcorn machine that was ultimately thrown in the trash for safety reasons."
2,Not what expected,"Seller didn't provide instructions for use. I found them eventually on the internet. Does not work well, novelty is all since my grandson loves Scooby Doo."
4,A superb small artistic film,"K. Harris wrote an excellent review of this superb artistic film based on a narrative poem, leaving nothing worthwhile to add. For those unfamiliar with the film, it is about a disatisfied editor who tries to reunite with his former lover over lunch. He hasn't seen her in 15 years. While he wrote only one book and is unsuccessful, she married a very successful author and is enjoying her life with her husband and children. The action in the film is sparse, but very telling. The acting is perfect. The film excells in the poetry of its language."
1,not what I had hoped for,"I love both actors. This work was highly disappointing! If you are interested in this title, rent first! I had to struggle, just to finish the movie."
2,boring,"for these two actors, i thought this was VERY boring, but then maybe i just wasn't in the mood that day. Will give it another chance at a later date."
3,"Solid acting, but overall not memorable","I was rather excited to find these two excellent actors reunited(after their respective roles in Harry Potter), but found the film in itself to be rather lacking. The acting is well done and it's not bad, it's just not gripping either. In fact, until seeing it again(ironically as a recommendation for me) here on amazon, I had pretty much forgotten it."
2,Café Depresso!,"I love both Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, whose performances in this film are superb, but, quite frankly, the ""Song of Lunch"" gave me a nasty case of indigestion!There is nothing worse than dining at a restaurant and being anywhere near a man and woman in the midst of a tiff, especially when he is embarrassing her by drinking too much wine. Precisely because Thompson and Rickman are so skilled at their art, I felt as if I had been thrust into the midst of these ex-lovers' problems (mostly his, actually; she had the good sense to leave him long ago for another man whom she married happily). I wanted to pay the bill and leave--or turn off the telly--especially when he began guzzling that second bottle of wine.Although I was initially willing to accept the literary device of poetry, which Rickman delivers peerlessly in voice-over, after a while, it seemed merely pretentious and self-indulgent.I recommend ""The Song of Lunch"" only with a strong antacid chaser!"
5,NOT a pro camcorder,"First let me just say, this is NOT a pro camcorder!!!WIth that said, this is one of the best investments I made for making memories. I had HDR-HC1 for about a year and used it moderately, and have been very happy with the results.Pros: 1. Great picture.2. Very light. Your arm will not get tired.3. Easy to use. Just put tape in and you are ready.4. Easy to connect to MacBook. Plug and play.Cons. 1. Needs more zoom.2. Build in mic not too great.3. Short battery life.4. Small view angle.There are some drop outs on the video, but i think that is because I use ""the"" cheapest tapes I can find. Even so, I only noticed one drop in 12-14 tapes.Good luck."
2,underwhelmed for the price,"I bought the HDR-HC1E the first weekend it was on sale as i wanted to update my old camcorder and thought this HD model woud be terrific. I was really excited to get it. However after a few months I'm quite disappointed with the performace for the $. Seriously consider the Panasonics (at a third less for the top line model) IMHO.The picture is grainy and the low light level performance terrible. And i find with a 5 yo kid so many occasions are indoors...ballet concert, kindergarten parade etc etc, all the sorts of events i use the camera for.We also just went on holidays and it's heavy and large compared to some new camcorders, which i wouldn't mind if the picture quality was first rate.I also found very frustrating the lack of information to help me get the best from this particular model camcorder. There's really nothing i can find. *Maybe* that would help.I would urge you if considering to go to a shop and compare models side by side first. I just took Sony's word......"
5,WONDERFUL X 2,More antics and even more hilarious fun. My daughter and I love this one too. Fun for the whole family. Rarely have I seen a show that embodies everything good about TV...it is usually the opposite. This one captures all the good things in a very wholesome and HILARIOUS way.
5,Love it!,My son fell in love with Shaun the Sheep when we saw it on the Disney Channel. I was excited to find full length DVDs of Shaun and the gang! We've enjoyed the video many times in the last 3 weeks!
5,Fun for all ages!,"We, my kids and I love Shaun the sheep. I teach elementary classes and use the 10 min. episodes as a reward for hard work in class. After a hard week (day..) of work I don't know who enjoys Shaun's adventures more, the kids or I. My grandson, who is 3 years old, loves it as well as my daughter (30+) who has held a ""Shaun The Sheep night"" for her friends. There is no talk in the episodes but it is amazing how much expression the creators of Shaun can create by just changing an eyebrow or an ear. I have quite a collection of Shaun the Sheep DVDs and am looking forward to the next one to be released!"
5,Excellent for kids and their parents!,"We first saw Shaun the Sheep on Disney and our son (one year old at the time) loved it so much we bought the DVD set from Amazon UK and a Region Free DVD player just so he could watch it. He's almost 2 1/2 now and still loves it. He recently started watching Wallace and Gromit and loves the trio of shows and the were-rabbit movie, too!"
2,What is that smell?,"I had purchased this light and used it a couple of times, then I put it into my bag for a couple of months. During the worst shoot that I have had for equipment, I had to use this light again, it being only the third time. I set the light up and turned it on for several minutes (4-8 minutes)to check the lighting, I was going to use it as a constant light source, with the mono-light. After it was positioned I turn the light off and went about my business.A few minutes later I smelled a faint odor similar to ""nuts roasting"", I immediately begain to look for the origin, which I found a moment later as I saw smoke trailing from the back portion of the light toward the ceiling.I unpluged the light, but it did not help,it was to late. By this time the light was in full meltdown mode, and I ended up dropping it into a tub full of water to douse the flames.I have a second mono-light unit which I have been using as the primary, which just keeps blowing fuses."
4,Very good story; would have made a good episode.,"This is a well-written if not flawless story, paying particular attention to characterization and ideas but not without its moments of action and high drama. It's not quite good enough to get into the five star range, but only just; it wrapped up a bit TOO neatly for words, leaving one very major subplot/plot complication completely unaddressed, but it was still a very enjoyable and worthwhile read, particularly for fans of McCoy."
4,McCoy's chance to shine,"I have read that a lot of editors were uneasy about giving McCoy his own story. That is why ""Probe"", by another Star Trek author was re written. This one doesn't fail on any level. I have to agree with one reviewer who said it wraps up a little too neatly. However it is still good overall and I'd have to give it 4 stars. It's rare to see such a good novel about McCoy. It's not about Kirk and Spock this time. That's the best aspect about the story.We get to see McCoy's long lost daughter. One of his rival classmates at the academy starts the Enterprise crew on the journey. McCoy's world is never the same again....."
2,What I want to know about a book,"What I see, and have always seen in Trek, is a basically clean series with noble and good characters. I'm fourteen, and I need influences like that. What I found in this book was that a favorite character of mine has an affair with an alien woman, who has a child, and THEN it turns out that other immoral stuff has happened. I won't spoil it for those of you who will read the book. But what I want to know about a book before reading it is this: Is it good, is it clean, will I enjoy it? While I enjoyed most of the book, (it IS well written) it wasn't very moral. I just want you to know that before you pick it up."
5,A wonderful and inexpensive way in,"I absolutely love this book. I agree with another reviewer who suggested that it for all musicians and not specifically for drummers; to me (a non-drummer), this is a virtue. The book does not discuss drum technique at all; rather it helps you explore two ""timelines"" - a clave pattern in four, and a pattern in six. All you need are way to play the included CD and something to make sound with - an instrument, your voice, a drum, or a tabletop. I don't know any other music instruction book that strikes such a perfect balance of simplicity and richness."
3,Not the author's best work for drummers...,"Alan Dworsky has provided great instructional texts for drummers. This book is probably best suited for musicians playing instruments other than drums, who want to understand rhythm better.For those who are looking for a book to teach them how to play their drum, I would suggest Dworsky's other books, specifically, ""How to Play the Djembe"" and ""Conga Drumming - A Beginner's Guide to Playing with Time"". Both of these are excellent resources and probably the best books available for entry level instruction for these instruments."
4,Very good but more for the serious student than the general reader,"Well thought out and exceptionally researched Mr. Butz's book is infinitely more readable than Eisenman's ""James the Brother of Jesus"". My only objection (and it is a minor one), is that Butz seems to feel he must prove the same points over and over while quoting numerous biblical scholars' (from every side of the issue) along the way. If one is writing a research paper on the subject, then a better book cannot be found but the definitive book on James for the general reader, at least in my opinion, remains unwritten."
4,A lot of fun,"The original Mezzos (and Kite) were dark crime noir and almost sickening to watch, despite the excellent animation.This is really neat storytelling in that they re-cast the characters as different people in a similar world. It's something done a lot in Japanese manga, I forgot the name, but it's equivalent to using the same actor in different fictions, like Harrison Ford going from Han Solo to Indiana Jones. The pink haired gun bunny is the central character, a backup thug is now a tech guy, a crime boss is now the head of the agency... Oh, and even minor characters have their parts. One girl who showed up for what, 3 seconds?, as a sicko's rape victim in ""Kite"" is now the 'shy girl learning to be tough' growth story sidekick.And, yeah, it's a ""TV Series"" to get some bucks. So what? Neat show and a lot of fun. I ordinarily don't like 'crime/action' stuff that much, but make an exception here."
5,Rock on,"DSA kicks ass, even though they are kinda dumb. Each character adds the ingredient to make the dsyfunctional family work to its advantage. Street tough girl, ex-cop, computer/hardware nerd. . .very interesting mix."
5,tits and a skintight bodysuit,"who can ask for more. the ONLY complaint I have, the show was too short, not enough eps."
3,Mezzo Complete Collection,Mezzo - Complete CollectionI AM A FAN OF THIS SERIES THOUGH I WOULD HAVE PREFERED THAT IT STAYED AS HARDCORE AS THE ORIGINAL MEZZO FORTE. STILL I ENJOY THE SHOW.
5,"theirs nothing better, then seeing a girl kicking ass",Mikura is so insane but I still love her. She smiles at danger. Her service is cracking skulls. She is part of a Danger Service Agency a high risk trio that pays the bills by putting your butt on the line. I don't think she can live in a peaceful world cause danger is her excitement.
5,Wow!,Nice hand gripper! Load this thing up with weights and crank out reps. My hands were worked so differently by the next day i felt it down to the bones in my hand. This machine is definitely for the hardcore user! The stress placed on the grip is a bit different using this machine and you can allow as many fingers as you want to exercise at one time just by altering your grip. I must admit my hands have been stronger a bit heavier using this machine so far.
1,Save your money,"This book is very disapointing. I have bought this book on the hype from the author on CNBC but I've regretted my purchase. Boring questions... a lot of info not related to trading but to personnal life of traders, their environment their family... and on and on. This book can be read in 2 hours and does not reveal any strong insight. Of course the 14 testimonials of the traders have one thing in comon... they all (or most of them) had Adrienne (the author) as their mentor. What a bias for a book. Save your money."
4,Snoop Dog,Love my Snoop Dog puzzle. It's just as cute in person. Hope to glue and frame for something whimsical in my basement.
2,Bad,When I opened the box to get to the flag I noticed the glass was broke in the corner of the case.I didn't want to have to mess with sending it back and have to wait on another one.
2,Bad Toaster,I paid over 160 dollars for this toaster because it matched my kitchen. But it broke in less than 11 months. I took it to the repair shop and there were 3 other identical bad toaster in there waiting to be repair. The repair shop guy told me this toaster has a timer problem. But the new timer broke again in less than a year. And DeLonghi won't fix it this time.
4,nice toaster,"This is a nice toaster oven, however, to warrent its retail price it would have to up the quality of its craftsmanship, other than that it works great"
2,Out of date version.,"The copy I bought was out of date; the copyright was dated 2006. It only touched briefly on Skype video, the topic I was most interested in. Admittedly, it was purchased from a used book vendor (New and Used option). Skype has moved on a long way since 2006 including the interface being updated."
1,"Sadly, no longer a proprietary design...just a cheap blade now.","I have previously posted praise for the Black & Decker Piranha blades becauseof their proprietary curved cutting edge carbide tips. This was a Black & Deckerexclusive, and made their blades superior to the average blade..NO LONGER SO!.I just received this 7.25"" blade, and; [1]No more curved carbide tips [2] Cheaplymade VERY ORDINARY blade MADE IN CHINA!.Blades of this quality and design are available at flea markets and anyplaceCHEAP blades are sold. Went from best blade on the market to Chinese crap!Beware!.I now know why the Black & Decker blades disappeared from the ""big box stores"".They are still identified as ""Black & Decker Piranha blades"". The desirableBlack & Decker EXCLUSIVE Piranha configured larger carbide tips are now cheap,straight, small (ordinary) tips as found on all cheap saw blades."
4,"Really, it's very difficult to know what to say.","This was the third live album by Buck Owens. It was recorded at his first ever concert in the UK in 1969. The concert was 50 minutes long, which seems short for a concert nowadays, but was pretty typical back then. There are two medleys of ""older"" hits. The more recent hits are played in their entirety for the most part, but faster. The finale of the concert is Buck #1 hit version of Chuck Berry's ""Johnny B. Goode"". This live version is the hit single version, although on the single, part of the announcer's introduction of Buck from the beginning of the concert is added to the beginning of the song. Really good concert, probably Buck's best live album."
2,"If it is not required for your class, don't buy it.","I bought this book because it was listed as an additional text book for my pediatric nursing class. I never even used it. My instructor didn't really teach from the subjects in the workbook, and since the reason I bought it was to help me pass the class, I really had no use for it."
3,Not that great,"It wasn't that great. It was an ordinary story, nothing special. It is kind of like the color gray. I wouldn't recommend reading this book, unless you are that bored."
4,Thwonk,I really liked this book. It was a good topic for a teenage girl. Even the book did not have a realistic plot every teenager at one time or another has wanted a little being whether it be a cupid or a genie to make there wishes come true. This book also goes to show you that no matter how bad you want love if you force yourself into it the results may not always be picture perfect. Because when a cupid pops into her life she has to make choices about her future but does not listen to what the cupid has to say. When she makes her wish not all the she wants happens. She thinks she has just gotten a dream date with the most popular guy in school but little does she know what a disaster the next few months will be. After things get out of hand she isnt really sure what she wants to do. All she knows she wants is the little cupid back. Will the cupid come back? Will her life take a turn for the better? Will her wish be undone? You have to read it to find out.
1,Predictable and Irritating,"I read Hope Was Here (also by Joan Bauer) and thought it was a well written, sweet book. This wasn't the case with Thwonk. The character, A.J was irritating and got on my nerves from the start. The way she was willing to sacrifice anything to get Peter was pathetic. I read on though, trying to find anything good about this book. I didn't.A.J being a photographer seemed like a filler to add more depth to the character, like something she tacked on to make her seem ""smart"" and not just some lovesick, foolish girl. Once again it didn't work. There was no character depth and it had a sappy, predictable ending. I'd like to see what had happened if she was stuck with him, not the supposed ""new life"" she has."
3,"Photography, teen romance, and Cupid....","Mix them all together and you have Joan Bauer's teenage(and for those teens at heart, like me)story. AJ is really into photography AND loves Peter Terris. With the Valentine's Day Dance fast approaching and dateless, she feels hopeless. Then one day, a cupid named Jonathan enters her life. Not many of us have actually met a cupid have we? So, here we have a YA novel with some very unrealistic premises yet it is so superbly written piece we go with the story. it is called ""Thwonk"" because that is the noise the arrow makes when Jonathan's arrow goes soaring through the air and into the hearts of those struck.Jonathan asks our jaded artist for a wish, and her wish is for Peter to love her. LOVE her is the least he does as he takes her on a rollercoaster ride. After that last loop, AJ learns some important lessons about herself, friends/school mates, and LOVE.""Thwonk"" is charming, sweet, fast paced, and lovable right to the last page.Eileen F."
4,This book for musicians is a good buy for Spice Girls' fans.,"The Spiceworld musical arrangement ""guide"" is fun for beginning musicians. I would definitely recommend it to voice teachers for their younger students who would enjoy singing the songs they listen to so frequently. The piano bits are a little too hard for the beginning pianist. If you like the Spice Girls' earlier material, I would recommend buying the Spice music arrangement guide (as opposed to SpiceWORLD). It has more of the Spice hits. This is a definitely a must-have for any die-hard Spice Girls' fan. It even comes with a poster!"
1,"Same Old, Same Old","I've read all of CQY's vampire stories and this is the last one for me. I loved the first few books, enjoyed the middle few, got heartily sick of the last 2 and this one I didn't even finish. Don't need to; I know how it ends. She is following the same basic formula for every book and while it was a good formula, it's time for a change! Hate to echo what's already been said here, but I'm sick of the same types of characters, the same dialog (SG and Roger seem to have the same bantering conversation in every book!), the same plot. CQY is a good writer and should not be wasting her time with this stuff. She should use her talents to explore new territory and techniques."
1,Windowbox azalea baskets,"I ordered two azalea baskets as gifts. They arrived withoug gift cards, and were DEAD within two days. The instructions stated they could be plantedoutdoors, but they were completely brown and dried up. I left seller feedback and never heard back from the company. I am terribly disappointed as these were Mother's Day gifts for my lovely daughters in law. Never again!"
3,Great book but....,"This is a great book. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, but it was really too fast paced. had I never read a book on C++ programming, I would have been lost. I still got lost in places, but after rereading again, caught on.I would recomend this book to someone who knows C++ but doesn't know how to apply that knowelege to making games."
2,"Nice beginning, but terrible end","The book is ok, but has many shortcomings. Chapters 5, 9 and 10 do not have enough examples. Chapter 9 and 10 are the worst, you might as well rip these chapters out of the book. I would not recommend this book."
3,Do not buy if you already know C++,"If you have studied C++ up to classes, don't buy this book, it will only tell you what you already know. This book is meant to teach you basics of C++ and how it can be applied to games, not teach you C++ techniques specific to games. This is essentially just a beginners book for C++."
5,Beginning C++ Game Programming,"No doubt one of the the finest C++ primers I've ever encountered, because C++, as a language, is not presented so much as a language as it is a means to teaching the reader GAME programming! Author Michael Dawson's approach to C++ is lean and meaningful. The reader learns C++ in bite-sized pieces as he/she is coding examples. The book outlines different ways of achieving the same result in it's quest to teach game and, incidentally, C++ programming! As Bill Cosby used to quip, ""If you're not careful, you just might learn something!"" Just as surely as the logic of the program cycles and iterations are absorbed, so are solid C++ programming fundamentals! The accompanying CD-ROM contains valuable coding examples and tools. The programming lessons migrate from the bare essentials (data types, variables and standard I/O) through decision-making to object oriented approaches and advanced use of classes. Great for the would-be beginning C++ programmer!"
4,Good introduction to C++,"This is a reasonable introduction to C++ and lays a lot of ground work for moving into more complicated aspects of game programming. What it doesn't do is teach you anything about displaying graphics: all of the programing is text only DOS-type games. You will need to learn win32 API or some other image display stuff before writhing even simple graphic programs.That said, I found the game-oriented presentation to be helpful. It makes the various functions a lot easier to understand when they are presented in a familiar context (gaming), with practical uses. A failing of many other programming books is that they take a rather abstract approach, leaving you unsure what you would ever use something for."
2,Ehh...Not so good,"The book is pretty crappy...its written is a very confusing manner and the code doesn't even work half the time...its completly unacceptable to have a PROGRAMMING BOOK with code thats flawed in such a huge manner, this is completly insane, it will teach you somethings...if you tweak all the code and get it to work,The simple fact is that you can get this information in an easier to read and free formate online, just google C++ tutorials, search Digg, search anything the info in this book is ""Eh"" at best."
2,Beginning C++ Programming -- With game examples,"As mentioned earlier, this book is more like an introduction to c++ than it is an introduction to game programmnig for people already knowing c++.I was so very very disapointed, when I got this book.I had the same interpretation of the title as Aaron F. Young (earlier review).If you consider bying this book be careful to read other reviews, so you know that what you get is a book on c++ with game examples."
4,Best Yet To Come...,"While I am happy to see a release of 'new' Robyn material available in the U.S., this EP can only be a predecessor to a hopefully planned full album (Which will include the Kleerup produced ""With Every Heartbeat"") or rerelease of 2005's ROBYN. Considered a mixed bag, RAKAMONIE offers selections that prove this Swede's multifaceted talent. With the current flavor in mainstream music, Robyn definately has her place to compete if not surpass the likes of Gwen Stefani and Fergie. Buy it for the outrageousness that is ""Konichiwa Bitches"" and her take on ""Jack U Off."" For something more meaty-Pick up the import of ROBYN which features amazing tracks ""Who's That Girl"" and Crash And Burn Girl."""
4,Satisfied Customer,"I was expecting it in the red cover, but I was very pleased non the less. A tiny bit of side notes by the previous owner, which I actually found helpful. Over all I was pretty happy to find it at my front door :)"
1,Completely Unsatisfied by Rainwater Studios!,"Never received my order. The picture was not available wither. They dont provide a tracking number so you cannot track down the package. To make matters even worse, they do not give you a refund until they receive the book back, and still charge 15 dollars to do so. Completely horrendous!"
3,Heavier wood will be better,"I purchased this based on its look and price range. The table is great. But the chairs are small, light weight. You pay for what you get.Looks nice for the price."
3,Black indie with brains,"Finally a different subject matter that highlights the diversity of what us Black folks are into. I thought the film dealt well with the subject of lucid dreaming. It does actually explain in detail what lucid dreaming is defined as, in a technical realm - and explores what some of the metaphysical possibilities can actually entail. Yeah, it doesn't look like they had a million bucks to shoot it, but the cinematography is adequate and watchable. No worse than any 'white' indie films that get gushed on like Primer or PI. The actors are attractive (that always helps, lol). And they deliver the material sufficiently. I hope that more movies like this have the guts to get made and showcase all the possibilities that we embody as a people."
5,Next Level living,"I highly enjoyed this film. Might be biased opinion because my brother and sistar produced and directed it but that could go either way :) Way to go O and Keda! Takes me to the Matrix, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings mindset. Higher consciousness"
2,"Wow, what's going on here? (2 Stars)","Bottom line: There is no such thing as a Best of Snoop Dogg CD when tracks like Gin & Juice, Murder Was the Case, and Who Am I? (to name only a few) are OMITTED. The previous two reviews for this so-called greatest hits CD are on-point; try to imagine a Nas greatest hits CD without any Illmatic tracks. Try to imagine there being a Wu-Tang Clan greatest hits CD without any tracks from Enter The Wu-Tang: 36 Chambers. Now, try and explain why there IS actually a Best of Snoop Dogg CD with no tracks from Doggystyle, or even Tha Doggfather.Sure, there are some decent tracks here, but not including any tracks from the Death Row era is inexcusable. This compilation is an insult to Snoop's oldest fans and should never have seen the light of day."
1,somebody was lazy with this one,obviously this is just a collection put together quickly. think of all the best of snoop albums death row already put out. The cover of the cd is the inside cover of the last meal. So you know this album didnt have any thought put into it.
2,What the F*** is This???,"Where are all the Classic Snoop tracks from the Chronic & Doggystyle?? This is definitely unworthy of being called ""Snoop's Best""....Go pick up ""The Chronic"" & ""Doggystyle"" if u want the real deal. Forget this record!"
4,Snoop Dogg Post Deathrow (Rating: 8 out of 10- -4 stars),"Obviously we have a bunch of idiot reviewers here. People who give this one star and claim that stuff from Doggystyle isn't on here must not know what the hell is going on. There is a Snoop Doggy Dogg's Deathrow's Greatest Hits CD that has stuff from Snoop made from 1993-1997. This is what Snoop made from 1998-2003. Did you even think for a second that Suge Knight was going to give Snoop the rights to his older material? There are many gems on here include one of his best songs ""B Please"" which is my favorite song from him post Death Row.I don't give it a perfect rating because some of his hit song were lack luster. This is a perfect overview of what Snoop made since he left Death Row Records. Don't listen to these one and two star reviewers. People claim to be Snoop Dogg fans, but are obviously not knowing the situation at hand."
2,Head Hangin' In Shame @ This One!,"As much as I like Snoop Dogg, this is by far, the worst greatest hits album ever assembled for the 2005. I have seen bad stuff in my life, but this tops the cake. They left out bunch of songs that were on ""The Chronic"", ""Doggystyles"" and even ""R&G: Rhythm and Gangsta"". Those songs definitely would have made this greatest album sell better. Don't get me wrong, the songs that are on this album are good, but these songs were not the reason that got him started and famous. Any fan of Snoop Dogg would agree with me when I say that this is a slap in the face of his fans. Not to mention a ""Pimp Slap'd""."
2,What the f*** is this??,"Where are all the Classic Snoop tracks from the Chronic & Doggystyle?? This is definitely unworthy of being called ""Snoop's Best""....Go pick up ""The Chronic"" & ""Doggystyle"" if u want the real deal. Forget this record!"
2,"""Guess who's back in the #$&!* house"".....","Do I have to ask the obvious question? Well......do I? Where are the tracks from ""Doggystyle""??? Where are his BEST known songs??? I know this probably has something to do with label issues, but c'mon. Having a ""Best Of"" from Snoop Dogg without the ""Doggystyle"" tracks, is like Dr. Dre having a ""Greatest Hits"" without anything from ""The Chronic""! Maybe this should have been called ""Best of the Priority Years"" instead. On the positive side there's still some dope tracks here, but I gots to have my ""Gin And Juice"". Bow-wow-wow."
3,Remixes to your favorite Snoop songs ... not the best idea.,"The Best of Snoop Dogg album is not what I'd consider ""the best of Snoop Dogg"" by any means. Snoop delivers some satisfying remixes in this album and if you like Snoop's work then you will probably find some good tracks here. Unfortunately, if you fell in love with some of Snoop's older work and have fond memories of those tracks then listening to Snoop make another remix of a classic might be downright painful.If you don't have those happy memories of the first time you listened to ""the D O double G"" then this album isn't bad at all. However, if you're just looking for a collection of Snoop's most popular classics then you need to buy a different album or make your own playlist from his older albums."
2,Are you all retarded?,They couldn't include any of the Death Row material because that company owns the masters to the recordings and obviously wouldn't hand them over with the bad blood between Suge and Snoop. This is a lame ass collection of his No Limit and Doggystyle recordings. Does no one realize Snoop split with Tha Row in 98?
2,glass half full,"seeing a Best of Snoop Dogg I'm thinking of the full hits not just the after ""Death Row"" Era.it's a very empty collection.no doubt Snoop has released a chunk of music since leaving Death row,but His biggest Monster Hits were part of Death Row Records.there are a few decent cuts here,but it's a glass half full here."
3,Temporary Respite From Their Usual Inanities,"The band which, arguably, did everything in their power to give psychedelic music the worst possible name had only one legitimately good album in them. And this was it. Whatever it was which enabled them to make it, it was a pity that it didn't stay with them. This version is also a treat for including among the bonus tracks ""Where Is My Mind"", one of the most underappreciated B-sides of 1960s rock."
4,Vanilla Cheese Prog,"If you can overlook some of the melodramatic corn in the vocals department (Bogert's in ""When I was a Boy""; Vinnie's moans and groans, the producer Shadow Morton's soliloquy, and Bogert's demand and plea in ""Season of the Witch""), here you have a great, yes, prog before there was prog album, complete with mature musicianship and complex arrangements far ahead of the psychedelia of the time. Bonus cuts on a classic LP usually spell ""muck up"", but luckily the ones on this Sundazed edition aren't too bad. (Has anyone noticed the master tape skewing at the end section of ""Faceless People""? Compare it to the vinyl, when the tapes were new.) Over all, a surprisingly nice addition to any prog collection. The beat goes on, indeed!"
5,Outstanding product for eczema !,"We used this product extensively for our newborn infant,who had moderate eczema. It worked wonders, when used often (at least 4 times daily)"
4,So what is the answer?,"If you have been there then you know the answer. The question is: Why did we travel there in the first place. Addictions are sneaky. Sometimes we write about them, other times we fight them. Addicted movie stars are just addicts. Hard drugs have no respect for who we are."
1,California Al,"I wanted to be interested in this book, but it became pretty boring ater a while. There is an undercurrent of romanticism that pervades the authors purpose. He claims to be neutral, yet his descriptions and conversations with many of the people slant towards idol worship. Although the author claims to be in recovery, I did not get the sense of how drugs and alcohol can ruin peoples lives. I felt that his narrative was self serving, and glorifying the wonders of drugs and experimentation. There is a price to pay. What was good was hearing his father's take on the whole down side of watching his son grow up loaded. That was interesting. I'm getting weary of the proselytizing about how epochal the 1960's, 70's and 80's were. I didn't like his picture either."
4,Interesting read,"I had to read this book for a Sociology class studying addiction. It was actually a quick read for the length because the stories usually grabbed me. It helps I was an older student and familiar with the cast of characters that are talked about. I know some of the students struggled with this book because they didn't understand the relevance of certain people (which made me feel older). It does tend meander a bit here and there, which can make certain parts of the book drag, but overall this is definitely an interesting read and outlook on the pervasiveness of drugs in our society."
2,Lacks focus,"This a fascinating book about a fascinating (and critical topic). But in appealling to the general reader, Mr. de Villiers inserts too much (for my taste) personal anecdote. A regrettable travelogue quality permeates the narrative.This is unfortunate, because there is much of value here. In particular, the discussion about the sources and uses of the Jordan River, Isreali concern with controlling its water supply, and water problems of the immediate Arab neighorhood, opened my eyes to an aspect of the current intractable problems of the Middle East.My advice is to read this with pleasure, but don't be afraid to skim if you find some portions of the narrative uninteresting."
2,Dissapointed also.,"My experience is similar to that of Curtis Weddle above. I also have an excellent pair of Swift binoculars. Of the half dozen or so binocs I own, these are my favorite. That is the main reason I purchased the 10x40 monocular.On the plus side, it has a nice hefty feel to it. But guess what? I can't get it focus to infinity! It seems if I could just rotate the focus wheel another half turn or so, it might get there. However, I refrained from applying a pipe wrench to it.I didn't spend much time with it after discovering that. It kicked around in my closet for several months, then I gave it to my wife's grandchild to play with."
2,bad on all levels.,I purchased this for $2 at a local video store thinking it would be enjoyable on an ironic level. It's just a waste--though I'll give it two stars since Bushwick Bill of the Geto Boys is in it.
2,Bargain bin material,"This is a low budget action movie that didn't quite come together. Cynthia Rothrock kicked booty as usual, but Fred Williamson and his character are unmemorable. The supposed budding romance between the Rothrock and Williamson characters lacked chemistry and thankfully there was no sex scene to strain credibility further. The plot is better than the usual martial arts movie, and this movie tries hard to be more than a kick-flick (the recovering alcoholic subplot comes to mind) but the overall story was not compelling.This movie is worth renting for Rothrock's martial arts skills, but it is not worth owning unless you can find it in the bargain bin."
1,This Item Does NOT Last!,"This is NOT a 'heavy duty' product. The wooden handle split the first time I used it. Not a 'brute', more like a daisy...."
1,Disappointed,"The title says workbook yet 2 discs were mailed to me. When I installed the discs, I thought the workbook would be on there and I could just print...NOPE!! I sent the disc back and still no refund and it's been almost a month. I'm a totally disappointed customer at this point!!!"
1,An excuse to keep actors employed?,"Or maybe someone lost a bet? How else do movies this terrible get made? I write these reviews just for the lulz, but this one isn't worth more than a few lines. What really astounds me is that, according to the other reviewers, the first House of the Dead is even worse than this one. Which begs the question: how did those viewers even survive the experience?Skip this film, it's not even worthy of being used as a coaster. *Spits in disdain*"
3,I enjoyed it...,"I don't think that it even bares mentioning that this is a step up from Uwe Boll's fantastic turd fest that was the original House of the Dead. If you're a fan of zombie movies, then this sequel is definitely up your ally, its tongue-in-cheek humor and silliness combined with a few points of genuine originality make for a fun view."
4,Excellent zombie flick...,"This was a very good movie, no matter what some people who are never pleased may want you to believe.This film was just as good as the first film, most would even say better.This was a lot more like a Romero film. Reminded me a lot of Land of the Dead.Many people put down the HOD movie series, though I'll never understand why.Don't listen to the haters. This movie is definitly worth owning, especially if you're a big zombie horror fan.I know I own both HOD films."
2,Not a total waste of time,"But that's about as far as I'd go. Decent production values, competent zombie attacks. I saw it on the Sci-Fi Channel, and it was better than most of the CG garbage movies they show. But if I had the money, I'd go to the arcade and play the video game, not buy this."
3,It's okay,"A professor tries to bring back the dead and accidentally creates a zombie virus that threatens the whole world. A secret government agency is sent to save the day. The zombies were okay, but the dialoque at times was ridiculous. All the male characters acted the same, and were hard to tell apart. It's really a 1 star movie, I only gave it 3 stars because I think Emauelle Vagier is a beautiful woman with a distinct gravely voice and she could be a big star if she got better parts. Still, if you are a zombie fan check this movie out on a slow night."
3,Good Zombie fun - should have been HOD 1,"With the first HOD being a complete joke, this new offering came across much more in the zombie vein we expect. Although, nothing we haven't seen before I found it acceptable for Zombie fans. There is some great gore and usual zombie goings on that one would expect. In my opinion, the first HOD should be pulled from the shelves to never been heard from again and this one retitled as HOD1. So to summarize.... zombie fun, not bad, ...good times. - also a few points for compelling DVD cover art, 3 points is a fair rating(Eyesofchaos dot com)"
3,"IMPROVEMENT OVER THE FIRST, ONLY JUST","Im a huge fan of zombie movies, but I have a few criticisms of the two House of the Dead movies.I dont know where they were going with the first movie because they just rushed it. There's no connection whatsoever between the movie and the three House of the Dead video games, maybe that wasnt their intention so I really didnt like the first one.The second one also had no association with the video games but the style of the movie did resemble what we play in the arcades. There were a number of flaws in the movie but the biggest one that I thought was ridiculous was if humans are vunerable to infection by a zombie through bite or scratch, what about contact to zombie blood. I do give points for the gore, but when they're covered in zombie blood wouldnt they eventually become infected anyway?. Just doesnt make sense."
3,Much better sequel,"Much better sequel, better acting, editing and visual effects, and a little bit more scary, not the best, but good effort. There were some very bad acting scenes and sequences that made no sense at all, I bet the director fell asleep at the end of the movie when the heroes went out of the school I fight to save their lives. I don't know what happened here, but it was definitively bad, at the beginning Zombies are very dangerous and quick to kill their victims and during the last scene they get stupid so the guy and the girl can escape so easily, that was very stupid, director should be ashamed because of this scene. That's why I did not give 4 or 5 stars, because this scene ruins the whole movie."
1,Pathetic excuse for a zombie movie.,"Ok,first of all let me say that i am not a zombie hater. I love zombie movies. I loved dawn of the dead (the old and new). Day of the dead, return of the living dead etc.But, this is not an improvement from the first. If you hated part 1 you will be disgusted with this one. And if you loved the first one then you will me disapointed in this one. There is a very good reason this one was not released nation wide in theaters. Not, that that would make it good but, i think they had a damn good reason they didn't waste any time with this one. Don't waste your money and if you don't mind you can watch it on regular T.V. That is if you would like to lose 2 hrs of your life you will never get back."
2,bad after taste,These little drops are sweet and 2 of the 3 flavors taste good. If you eat more than a couple they leave a burning sensation on your tongue. they are expensive.
4,Good Buy,"I enjoy playing this with my son, helping him out. The good thing is you never have to buy books anymore. You can just place the tiles on the board and go at your own pace. The only downside is that you can't travel with it. The game does come with some setups. The setups do take some time and can get a little confusing but not bad at all."
2,poor visuals,"Video does not show clearly enough the hand actions of Ms. Galati. She does all of the steps too quickly for them to be clearly understood. I wish I hadn't spent the money on the DVD, I would have been better off to find a local shop that gives hands-on lessons on sock knitting."
4,Very good instructions,"I found this DVD to have the best instructions for sockknitting that I've come across.I have to agree with another reviewer, however; please, Nenah, lose the glittery polish, long nails and sparkly rings, they so distract from the knitting!Otherwise, I'd have given the DVD five stars."
5,Easy to follow presentation,I found this video very helpful and was pleased with the results. I will probably buy the video that shows how to knit 2 socks at the same time and would certainly recommend this first video.
5,What an Inspiration!!,"Even though this tape was made in the 90's, the routine that Cory uses is time-tested and effective. I love working out with Cory. She's very likeable, has a great personality, and I am seeing very impressive results since I've been doing this workout. I do this routine at least twice weekly, and have added an additional set to increase the effectiveness for me.Cory has a beautiful body and it is very obvious why she won Ms. Olympia six times!!! She knows what works and I am a testimony to that.I look forward to doing this workout!!!"
4,"Blood Money, Honey.","The Hitman series has been touted as the breakthrough hit for the stealth genre. Hitman 2: Silent Assassin improved upon everything that was wrong with Hitman: Codename 47. Hitman 2 is still one of my favorite games. Hitman: Contracts was a backslide, but still a respectable title. Blood Money has similar story structure to Contracts, less cohesive than Hitman 2, and more ""Flash-backy"" and choppy. Only a few missions are related and only because they are in similar locales.47's New abilities and the AI behavior are awesome additions, making the level playthroughs different and interesting each time. I have owned it for almost a week and I have played it constantly. It is almsot too fun, which scares me.You should rent it or borrow it at least. You will like it so much that you will buy it."
2,really not what i expected,"First of all, im just gonna comment that apparently i am the only person that could not understand how to carryout levels what-so-ever. you have no guidance at all, and in this game there were times where u were meant to do certain things in order for the levels to play out smoothly, and of course, you dont get a heads up on having to do these things. but thats ok because after about 10 friggin tries you'll get it.despite this, once you actually figure out what you are supposed to do, the game ends up being lots of fun because it all works out. the graphics were nice as was the general gameplay. worth a buy? not so much, so you might as well pick it up at blockbuster."
2,boring,"I struggled to stay interested with this book. It starts off ok, but then somehow, it got so boring. I couldn't finish it."
2,Overhyped serial killer,A bit disappointed by this book which I did not find as incisive as say 'Primal fear' or 'The poet' for instance.
4,The Godfather Of Serial Killer Novels,"This is my all-time favorite book. I have already read it twice and wanted to have a copy for future reading. Unfortunately, it is an older publishing and out of print, so I bought a used copy. I was glad to have the book but a little disappointed in the quality due to several stains. It was rated ""Very Good"" but would really struggle to be rated ""Good"". Still, I have a copy now and will enjoy it again and again."
2,"Lot's of potential, went nowhere","I picked up this book believing it would be an exciting read about a serial killer based on the quotes on the cover. The first 1/4 of the story was what I expected and held my interest quite well. Then it somehow morphed into a novel about the excruciating daily minutia of the lives of the journalists and politicians trying to track down the killer. The author spends 200+ pages detailing the mundane lives of people who add nothing to the plot. I forced myself to finish the book, but by the end it was no longer interesting to read about these people coming so close to catching the killer and then blowing it at the last second. In my opinion, the book is advertised in a misleading manner. If you're looking for a novel about a serial killer, this book misses the mark."
3,A cure for insomnia,"I can't believe so many people gave this book five stars. I gave it three and thought I was being generous.I'm about 3/4 of the way through and I'm really close to giving up. It's boring! The premise is excellent but the execution is terrible.The writing is horrible. The timeline of the story is out of sync. And none of the characters are likable or interesting. Not even the main character!Here is an example of the writing: ""He had himself postulated the theory. Naturellement!""Here is a conversation between two people in the book (I left out the narration, but it doesn't change the context or the conversation at all):""They got canals in the streets?""""Damn right.""""What's in the canals?""""Never saw them. They there all the same. Everybody knows 'bout them.""""That's the salt.""""What's that?""""You got the salt there.""""Damn right. Too much sugar's no good for you.""This should have been, could have been, a page turner. Instead, it's a major snoozer. Zzzzzzzzzz"
2,Pretty Average,while Mariah&Whitney are two of the Greatest Vocalists Ever in Pop Music History this Song is the kind of song that the Oscars like&push to Win.when you got Voices like this you want a Song with more bark&Bite than this track.
2,The only reason to get this is cause it's Mariah,This has go to be my least favorite Mariah song. I'm not sure if it's cause it wasn't written by Mariah or if it's cause I don't like it when Whintey does duets. But the only reason I see to buy it is because it's Mariah.
5,Very happy With Purchase~Company works with you 100%,I ordered this pair of Children's Boots for my grandchild and was very happy with the service and transaction.The company very kindly exchanged my size and very quickly returned my order back to me.Would highly reccommend this Company to anyone.
3,Fair,"Well written, the author clearly has subject knowledge. I am thinking of buying a gun and I found book wonderful. A bit dated and certainly short, but good. I bought it from his website for $9. I would not have liked to pay more than that, having read it in about 1/2 hour! Each chapter left me wanting more info and I suppose that merely elucidates the fact that I am embarking on a world rife with info that I need to learn.I will likely buy more from author, as the other reviews of his titles are excellent."
1,Terrible. Not even a camera.,Honestly I expected some terrible pictures but in fact the software won't even download any -- it just says No pictures on camera. So there you have it. Glad I didn't spend any money on it! Even the 15 minutes I spent was a waste.
3,Mars and Venus comes early!,"Never having the time to read this classic while in College, I sat down to read this epic a few weeks back. I was delighted by the detail in the translation and consumed with keeping track of the families. The only concern I had were the implications of making the ""peace"" sections concerned with such trivial matters (children cavorting, women giggling) and the ""war"" sections so completely detached. This is well worth the read, but as Mars and Venus dictate, many will find themselves aching to get to the next section."
2,Nearly unreadable font,"This is a wonderful novel but a poor edition. The font is very small, and question marks are extra small -- they look like tiny squiggles. This edition uses single quotes instead of standard double quotes, which is distracting. I found this edition unpleasant to read and will buy another one to better enjoy this novel."
2,Needs a good translation,"I have tried reading ""War and peace"" three times in my life and have failed to get past the first two hundred pages each time. The reason, I believe, is that there is not a single inspired translation available in English. I have tried the three main translations and they all are wooden affairs. Episodes that should be moving are pedestrian. The opening soiree should be full of sly description that borders on the contemptuous and humorous. Instead, I never was able to forget that I was reading to what amounted to no more than a servicable translation lacking in vitality."
4,A big book of big ideas,"Tolstoy's epic novel is a suprisingly quick 1400 pgs. It takes a bit of determination to get through the first sections of the book, as the number of characters grows faster than many readers can remember. The effort, however, is well rewarded.The book consists of several essential themes interwoven into a single story. It is a heroic epic, a romance, a spiritual quest, and a treatise on history. It succeeds on all accounts, leaving the reader with deep insights into the nature of love and religion, the causes of the Napoleonic wars, and the role of heroes in history.The large time investment in this novel is justified by what the reader takes away from it."
4,"Undoubtedly a classic, but a few flaws","If you like epic sweep, you will not be disappointed, but bear these things in mind: 1. The romantic resolutions are too tidy to be satisfactory. 2. The social jostling among minor players of the upper class is not an original theme and has been dealt with much more creatively by other authors. 3. Tolstoy sometimes gets bogged down with his theory of history, and the second epilogue is truly a snore."
3,War and Peace: Excitement and Boredom,As the title indicates this book is split up into two parts. One about War and the other about peace time during the invasion of Russia by Napoleon. The War part is excellnt and gives you an insight into this period of time which you can not find anywhere else. The peace times however are very boring and hard to suffer through. I'd have actually given the book three and one half stars if given the option.
5,The greatest novel ever written,"I first read this book when I was fourteen. I've read it several times since. Each time, something different has come out--something true, deep, instructive. Moreover, each of the main character has become like a friend. The bulk of the book (before the epilogue) covers about seven years of time, and Tolstoy is a master of developing his characters, of letting them subtly grow over those years. Don't let the size of the book scare you. It's a very easy read. The first few chapters are enough to completely hook you--and by the time you finish, you wish there was more. You'll wish he had written a sequel.The only parts of the book that I would NOT recommend are Tolstoy's ""philosophy of history"" chapters--where he discusses what he considers to be the nature of grand historical events. But they come mostly towards the end, they're easily identifiable, and even more easily skipped without any loss whatsoever to the story."
5,Tolstoy's Russian epic,"I just want to recommend to those who have trouble remembering all of the character names in this classic that they try to read some other work in Russian literature before they jump into ""War and Peace."" This will allow them to familiarize themselves with the Russian name form (i.e. nickname, or Given Name and Patronymic) which, in turn, will help them to better be able to remember the numerous character names in War and Peace. A second, and more important, tip I can offer, is to catorgorize the caracters into two groups: ""Us"" (e.g. Pierre, Natasha, Prince Andrew, etc.) and ""them"" (e.g. Anna Pavlovna, Prince Vasili, Anna Mikaylovna, etc.). To help to remember ""them"" ascribe a defining characteristic to their character. Thus, when encountered by one of ""them,"" think of their defining characteristic and how it interplays with a member of ""us."" This novel is truly one of the greatest of all time, so give it the time it deserves until you are engrossed. You won't regret it."
3,"Book good, Translation not","I recently read the Carmichael translation of Anna Karenina... I enjoyed the book but found the translation to be less than impressive in some parts. The word ""highfalutin"" was used at least three times, which I found to be more appropriate in a John Wayne movie than a Tolstoy novel. I would certainly recommend this book, but not necessarily the Bantam edition."
3,Not what I expected,"To sum up: A group of amazingly spoiled rich people have their lives interrupted by a war and most don't learn anything from it. This was a long read, interesting in parts, but I found it extremely hard to sympathize with any of the characters as they are so incredibly self-absorbed, status-conscious and all are idle rich. If this is an accurate portrayal of the upper strata of society of the time it's no wonder there was an eventual revolution! A ""classic""? I don't agree."
1,An aggravated descent into boredom,"Let me start by acknowledging that Leo Tolstoy is often regarded as one of the preeminent authors of all time. Let me follow that with the acknowledgement that many consider ""War and Peace"" to be the greatest triumph in human literature.Let me follow that by saying that I don't get it.This book is horribly boring. While other lengthy works, like Les Miserables, excite and build intrigue, War and Peace does nothing of the sort. It ambles on, like a wounded victim hoping to be put out of its misery. After a thousand pages, that is exactly what I did. I threw the book clear across the room in disgust with what was a lethargic, uninteresting, and needlessly convoluted tale."
3,Only three stars because I'm only halfway finished!,"Okay, so I picked this up and couldn't put it down!And then I went on vacation, and it was just not beach-type reading material.However, I do intend to finish it. That being said, I liked the ""Peace"" parts of the book better than the ""War"" parts. Maybe it's the girl in me. Fighting and armies, and politics don't do it for me, but this is HALF of the book, so be warned.I was more attracted to the daily lives and doings of the families- the loves, the losses, the parties, etc.Read it just to say you've read it, and you'll probably end up liking it!"
1,Horrible,"You will need a scorecard to keep track of the characters in this one. There must be hundreds, if not thousands. None of them were interesting enough to bother with and I quit the book after three hundred pages of being bored out of my mind. Every few pages, I had to try to remember which character was which as there were so many and many of them were indistinguishable from each other. Tolstoy writes pretty flat prose. It never soars or goes anywhere. He just describes and reports, as boringly as possible. This type of literature is not going to hold an audience anymore. So many people have the opportunity to live interesting lives nowadays why would they stop to read a novel of this length about a bunch of fictional charaters when they could be spending the time actually LIVING their own lives? It was a real drag."
4,A true classic,"I think that this book is a classic and a true masterpiece. It has the ability to take you back into that time period. But like a true classic it doesn't have the feeling of what real life is like in today time. This time span makes the book kind of hard to connect with as a person and at some points lacks the personal understanding of today's books. Through out the story the women seem to feel flat and two-dimensional compared to women, as we know them in today's world. However, Leo Tolstoy does an excellent job of depicting the art of war and how human nature reacts to real life events. Although this book is extremely long written I would still recommend it to a true fan of classic literature. But, I would forewarn you that this book is as much a challenge as it is a masterpice."
2,umm,"Im 11, thatas probably why i really dont like the book, but my point made is, my mom grounded me and made me read war and peace, and it was the worst punistment i have ever been through, i asked my family to read a page of it, and they all fell asleep, sorry to all the people who like it.."
3,"Great story, but terrible historical accuracy....","For me at first the novel started pretty good, and was quite one of the best I ever read, but from the half part of the book on after the french invasion of Russia, I was shocked to see so much historicals inaccuracies, and descriptions that seemed more and more propagandistic. For example his description of Napoleon, as a tiny egocentric man, that believes his own lies, and this is the secret from his victory, obviuosly seem more of Russian propaganda than anything else. And besides the Battle of Borodino, WAS A FRENCH VICTORY, and a Russian one, like Tolstoy try to makes us think....... Perhaps this is because of the time were he lived..... In summary buy it if you want to hear a great story about human nature. But take it as a fiction, as hardly anything Tolstoy says may be actually considered truth in a historical sense."
5,"Yes, it's long...","and yes, people do remark on it if you read it in public. But this book is more than worth the time and the comments. I can't imagine there's another novel out there that covers military strategy, theology, historiography, and social status in nineteenth century Russia - and still has all the plot of Gone with the Wind! I picked it up in a bookstore, thought ""Oh, I really *should* read this"", and I found it to be a real pleasure. I'm actually looking forward to reading it again. It is so crammed full, even at 1400+ pages, that I'm sure I'll take different things away from it next time."
5,will stand the test of time !!!,"I've had this mill for over 12 years now. It grinds as if i had bought it yesterday. Never fails! a few cranks and it dispenses a good amount of pepper. i plan on buying the salt mill since im into grinding sea salt now. This will be the best pepper mill you will ever own. i can attest to that. mechanism is smooth, its sturdy, good quality and attractive. If you can't imagine putting that much money into a pepper mill, ask yourself this: what is best ? spending this amount on an atlas that will last practically a lifetime or spending 10-15 dollars on a cheaper one that will need replacing within the year ?(which i shamefully admit having done until i've had enough). Do the math and save yourself the trouble and money. Buy this product, its worth it !"
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought this door from one of the big box stores because it was the only one I could find and it was priced right. I move a lot so I have a lot of experience with installing dog doors. The installation for this door is ""Average"" it's going to take some time but no major design flaws in my book. However, this is a weak door and you get what you pay for. The slightest breeze and the door would open 3-4 inches, letting heat, cold and unwanted critters to come as they please. The magnets are very weak and even if i manually ""shut"" the door it would open with the wind or when my dog used it. I think this would be a fine door on a dog house or maybe even for a garage or barn but I would not recommend it for entrance into a home. We finally bit the bullet and shelled the big bucks for a freedom pet pass door. Nothing but good things to say about the door - still hurting over the cost."
4,Works well for my furkids!,"I have three small dogs and two cats and they all have learned to use this pet door without any problem. It works well. I had read previous reviews, however, and bought metal screws to replace the plastic ones they sent to keep the flap in place. I think that's one change the manufacturer should definitely make."
5,Very impressed,"After a lot of searching I decided on this dog door. This was to be a replacement from the ""deadbolt"" doggie doors. This is so much better, it comes with the slide in attachment to prevent dogs from going out when you don't want them to, and keeps outside critters, out. With the deadbolt door, my dogs were constantly breaking it, and the door just didn't hold up like I thought it should for the money. So if you are debating between the 2, go with this one!"
2,Plastic!,"metal frame, rubber-like flap, but PLASTIC security door. I should have returned this, and spend $4. more at Lowes for the same door I looked at and opened with a metal security door.Plastic bolts that hold the door in place are not secure and break VERY easily. I called Petsafe and they are not covered and will not replace when you break them before you get the door installed."
4,Dog Door Review,"Purchased for the cats and dog. Once it's in it looks good, weather worthy from the garage into the mud room and works like I hoped. The price is also a great value. The magnetic flap works great and I live in a pretty cold region this time of year. Installing -yyks...it would have been simple if you just walk right out the door to the same level. Be ready for some creative math so your pet doesn't do a header down the steps when it goes out the door. Not included in the instructions. Would however definitely recommend this product."
5,works well,We already had a doggie door but this was easy to install. As with one of the other reviews said.....was disapointed in the plastic screws.
3,It doesn't close properly,"I have had a Large PetSafe pet door for many years and was very happy with it. I assumed the same product in an Extra Large size would work the simarlarly. Unfortunately, the flap on the XL does not close properly when the dog enters and there are large gaps on the sides that allow insects to get in. I would try a different brand when I have to get another XL size for another door."
3,Dogs have never been happier,"I bought this on a lightening deal. I don't know why this one is more than the plastic, it doesn't seem to be of better construction. The flap doesn't seal very well and is often open about a half inch at the bottom. My dogs love it, but when it's 10 degrees outside, it's a pretty big gap to have. I had a PetSafe plastic version before and never had this problem. I keep the cover on at night so it doesn't leak all night.In conclusion, I would probably buy the plastic version since it is less money and has worked the same if not better in the past."
3,OK but not a draft-stopper,"The installation went fine, but, like most everyone else, we did not use the flimsy plastic screws that came with the door. The plastic screws were so soft that they flexed like old string beans. The main disappointment is that this door does not stop drafts at all! The weatherstripping is so small that it does virtually nothing. And, if any sort of breeze blows toward the flap, the flap sails open as if an invisible dog were standing there. We knew that it isn't an insulated pet door but would have liked better performance than it offers. Heavier duty weatherstripping and/or magnet could do the trick. Next time, we will buy a serious weather handling pet door."
2,Size is not accurate,We ordered this door because the rating was for an up to 40 lb dog and the door size was stated to be 13 X 21. No where does it state that the actual door opening is 11 x 8 which will not accommdate any 40 lb dog I know of. The larger door would be more appropriate.
4,Best thing I ever purchased for my dog,"Getting a doggie door is the best thing I ever did for myself and my dog. I had someone else install it so I can't speak to the installation process. But I agree that the size is misleading. My dog is only 16lbs and he barely fits through the small door. Also, after time, the magnetic strip doesn't always pull the flap closed. The romovable locking door works perfectly. Overall, I am very satisfied with this product."
2,Poor Quality for the price,"I recently replaced a RuffWeather dog door with this Pet Safe brand due to our dogs requiring a larger door than the one the house came with. The RuffWeather one was plastic, but had two flaps and a nice gasket seal around the edge which allowed to be virtually draft free even with the howling winds we get here in Colorado. The PetSafe brand however has no gasket, and the flap does not fit the hole precisely which allows a lot of draft to flow through. I would not recommend this door to anyone unless it is being used to go from one insulated area of the house to the other. If you need a door to go to the outside I would highly suggest the RuffWeather brand as it is comparably priced and is of much higher quality."
1,nice picture,"Why don't you people put up the correct picture for the product??? If you're going to sell a Ford, you wouldn't put up a picture of a Chevy...would you? Irritating. I want an actual picture of what I'm buying to confirm its right."
1,Delivered Wrong Size,"I was very disappointed when I received the dog door. I was so excited when I found a dog door that would fit our Bulldog. I was skeptical about ordering online but was unable to find a dog door with these dimensions locally. The 13 x 2.2 x 21.9 as advertised would have been perfect. Rather I received 10 1/4 x 14??? Now I have to deal with the hassle of sending it back, waiting for a response or the correct size. What a pain!"
1,Size doesn't match description,"Careful when ordering this product. The measurements of the door in the description were incorrect when I ordered it. The description read something close to 14.75"" wide, but the actual flap on the door is only 10.25"" wide. Had to return the product because my 75 lb dogs, lab and husky, would not fit through the narrow opening. Ordered an XL instead."
2,pet safe aluminum pet door,This door is useless for keeping the cold breeze out even when the bottom is closed by very weak magnets the breeze comes in the sides of the flap but most of the time its all open. Only on a very fine calm day is flap completely closed. Only have it in a few days but already looking for more energy efficient one.
5,Cumbia con Acordion,"This is one of the best CD's that I have ever heard. It's the one that you are looking for. IT's very authentic and has a lot of accordion action through out all of the songs. If your looking for Cumbias with a lot of accordian, this is your CD. This CD is loaded with the old school Cumbiamberos so your guarenteed to love the CD."
1,False Shaolin Drunkard,"I recently ordered this movie from Amazon hoping to watch this wonderfully bizarre piece of kung fu again. It is one of my favorite martial arts movies that I haven't seen in years. Well, they got the cover right, but the dvd in the sleeve was a dvr of Shaolin Drunk Fighter. Wrong movie and not even a legitimate copy. Close but no cigar."
2,"DVD awful, movie probably good.","I had the same problem as someone else who said that the disc would skip and pause and play at random, and when trying to access special features it would make a low beeping noise and just shut off.The part of the movie I did see was okay, it's just too bad that it started acting up when it was about to get really good. If the movie alone is available possibly not presented by the Wu-Tang Clan or Ground Zero, I'd give it a go."
1,KILL GROUND ZERO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is for products only! Morons! Anyways! I bought acopy of Shaolin Drunkard by Ground Zero Ent. Man, GZ Ent. are abunch of uneducated mongoloids! This copy I got, the DVD wouldkeep pausing and playing over and over again! And when youupload the extras, these squares would appear out of nowhere andthe DVD will stop playing! So word to the wise, don't get theGround Zero version copy, not unless you're one of those peoplewho are easily amused by train wreck products!The movie itself is like Miricle Fighters and Taoism Drunkard!Alot of weird crap with some nifty kung fu and Cantonese humor!"
2,and im being generous with the 2,"This movie is horrible, not at all what the box sets it out to be, i was mad as hell when i got done watching this film. Only should be seen by real martial arts film fanatics, cause there the only ones that could get something out of it.bad movie"
1,Tempos are Lethargic!,"Why is ""Procession of the Sardar"" taken so slow lately? My recording of Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops is so energized and my old recording with Anatole Fistoulari on and RCA LP is so much more energized! Both Fagan (NAXOS) and Gluschenko are so slow! It seems that elephants are processing! I also do not like Tjeknavorian's because of the cavernous sound. In the 3rd symphony, Stokowski and Tjeknavorian win hands down-at 18 minutes apiece, at least the experience is not as long as Gluschenko's-25 minutes! It just goes on and on!! This CD needed lots of pumping up. It sounds to me like a rehearsal instead of a finished performance. Keep your fingers crossed for a A1 recording of the Sketches in the future."
5,Great Quality!,These may be some of the nicest shoes I have ever owned. I don't think I can wear cheap shoes again. I could see and feel the quality the minute I took them out of the box. Great looking shoes that I know I will have for years to come. I will buy more Allen Edmonds shoes in the future.
3,"Look nice, a little tight in the toe box","I purchased these a gift for my husband. I bought the same size as all of his other nice dress shoes; however he says that these are a little tighter in the toe box than what he prefers. He likes the way they look, but is ready to get them off on days that he wears them."
4,This mans talent will grow on you,"I first heard this album at a listening booth in the record shop, and was captivated by both the unique musical style and his incredible voice.The album is deliciously varied, with a track reminiscent of Godley & Creme! On many tracks the vocals alone carry the listener, but combine beautifully with chords and melodies to create a rich experience. This is one of those albums that grows on you."
1,Disappointed,I was quite disappointed in this. The price was quite high for a small book but I expected high quality Haiku inside. I was disappointed.
3,,"The Nevermore comparisons I've been reading about this particular band are unfair. These guys are way better than Nevermore. The vocalist has a strong set of pipes, which he uses, to his maximum extent, serving as a solid conduit for the music to flow on. The music does have a lot of power, something many power metal bands don't know how to incorporate (i.e. Hammerfall, Blind Guardian and legion others). Sure, the album is a bit progressive on some areas, but for the most parts these are actual compositions with a heavy emphasis on actual songwriting-as simple as that. Therefore, each song achieves memorably a level of completeness. Great vocals, awesome riffing, many neck-breaking passages, and a perfect representation of heavy metal is what you'll find here. 3.5/5"
5,A MUST FOR CHURCHILLIANS,A GREAT WORK SHOWING US HOW WINSTON CHURCHILL FORGED HIS OWN IMAGE . LOTS OF QUESTIONS ANSWERED FOR THE FIRST TIME HERE. AND MUCH MORE . A GREAT BOOK
1,unconvincing stories,"A series of short stories, main character being a feng shui master doing his work around Asia and solving mysteries along the way. But actually it's nothing to do with feng shui at all - it's just the setting of the story that the main character is a feng shui man. Being a HK Chinese, having heard from the media from time to time on feng shui stuff, I don't quite understand the feng shui bit described in the bk. I think the writer just want to baffle Western readers.Plus unconvincing stories (sorry for the spoiler here)-- old man disguised as an old lady but not spotted even being talked to face-to-face? A scam branch being opened (in S'pore!) in the name of a well-est'd bank but the victim knows nothing? A publisher stealing template from a magazine, printing & selling for profits at the magazine's expense? i can't think of anything more unconvincing, really...i was attracted by the title and planned to buy the other works of Vittachi. But now there's no need."
2,overrated,"I tried to read this book, but it was too silly. Not lighthearted, just simply SILLY! Could not finish it. The ridiculous Wendy, so boring."
4,Wonderful read,"Both this book and Vittachi's follow-on ""The Feng Shui Detective Goes South"" are spot-on when dealing with the issues of Feng Shui and how it fits into the daily lives of of individuals. His detective is likable but not devoid of normal foibles and mistakes.The writing captures the sights/smells/sounds of life in the East very well. My only preference would have been for more focus on Hong Kong (Gongers are more superstitious than any group I've encountered) especially since the author has spent so much time there. But, this is a minor point. I've spent 4 years living in Hong Kong, 3 in Beijing and made long visits to Australia and Singapore (two months in each location) and can attest to the authenticity of the world that Vittachi has painted."
2,This Book is not Helpful to the Average Tourist,"The author seems to know what she is talking about in Rome which is the lagest part of the book. Her recommendations in Florence and Venice seem to be based mostly on hearsay.Consider this: The book is 274 pages long. The glossary of terms and bibliograpy account for 72 pages. The book does review trattorias but it also reviews expensive restaurants, pizzerias,gelaterias, wine bars , shops that sell wine and serve light lunches, and wine shops that offer tastings and canapes. There is a lot of detail im this book, but after reading it I decided it was of little practical use to me since I am an ordinary tourist looking for a good place to eat near the attractions I will be visiting on this my third trip to Rome (second to Florence and Venice). Many of the recommendations are clustered in neighborhoods that are somewhat removed. The book is not going on my trip with me... The purchase price was a waste of money."
3,Trattorias Timeout,"A comprehensive critique of eating establishments in Rome, Florence and Venice, Italy, this book is well written and fun to read. The author must have spent years dining out to compile her list. The glossary is helpful, as it translates Italian menus in great detail. Many classic Italian dishes are explained, including their origins. The book has become dated, however, so I wonder how many of the reviewed establishments are still in business and preparing the foods as described. Perhaps a new edition is warranted!"
2,"""I haven't eaten here but...""","""...I've looked through the window"" was the first sentence I read when looking though the Florence section. I'm sorry, but looking through the window doesn't exactly qualify one to write a review of their food. I've looked through the windows of loads of restaurants I haven't eaten in - can I publish a book too? All in all this book was a disappointment, at least for the Florence section. I see from other reviews that she is more familiar with Rome, so perhaps this book would be worth buying for that instead. I recommend Sandra Gustafson's ""Cheap Eats in Italy"" instead. The title is misleading (although you can eat cheaply if you follow her advice on what to order) and is full of wonderful recommendations from simple tripe stalls to fancy restaurants."
1,Just a bunch of Freeware,"After playing one of the games for a little while, you get messages constantly popping up saying ""If you want to continue playing, send money to ..."". If you look at the back of the package, in fine print it says something about all of the games being ""Trialware"" or something like that."
2,100 Shareware Teases for the Palm,"I was disappointed when I found out many of the games require registering to get a fully functioning version. This should be clearly marked on the packaging and in all descriptions. I was going to say ""you get what you pay for,"" but there are some great freeware apps out there for Palm. Search the 'Net!"
3,"Cool Games, But BEWARE!","This package has some really cool games and utilities. BUT: certain applications will only run for 14-15 days unless you register and PAY for the application on a website. IE: Infared remote control for VCR, TV, CD, DVD, will only run the TV unless you pay $20.00 at a website. I gave it three stars because it does have some neat games and utilites. All in all, it is pretty nice."
1,100 Great Ways to Lose Your Money,"For those of you who are old enough, remember the video game Pong? It was much more fun that this CD. If you want good quality games that are ready to go and have minimal aggravation to load, then don't buy this item. The potential 'good' ones on this CD require more money to be coughed up to activate fully. And the games that don't fit this category would'nt keep a 3yr old entertained. There's just something distasteful about charging for a product that instantly will cost you more money just to get it working fully. So don't waste your money on this one."
3,Lots of Games-but not forever,"This CD has lots of games. There is something for everyone. Some games are lame. Some are hot. Unfortunately, many of the hot games are just trial versions and they won't last forever for free. You'll have to register(and pay$) if you want to keep going."
5,First Class - little more to say really,"By far the best single volume covering the North American butterflies. I have only one reservation. I don't know if this is a cultural thing, but US guide books tend towards colour photos instead of drawings. For a foreigner (UK) who hasn't been brought up with the American fauna, it is nearly impossible to tell from a photo which marks on an insect's wing are characteristics of the species, and which are that-own-specific-individual-in-the-photo's unique birth marks, imperfections etc. The better of the European butterfly guide books, and most of the world's better bird books all use high quality generalized drawings/paintings.Superb overall quality and an absolute must for anyone with the slightest serious interest."
4,Good preperation for the FE Exam,This book was quite useful in studying for the FE exam and does a great job of preparing one for the exam. This book is a good value for those looking for a fast way to brush up on things prior to taking the exam.
5,Great book definitely worth it,"I bought this book and used it to study for the FE. I passed it when I took it in October 2010. This book was helpful to refresh my memory on things I forgot in classes I took years ago, and it also helped me better understand some subjects I didn't do so well in. Just buy it, study it, and you'll be fine :)"
4,EIT Review Book,I think this book covers the material very good. The methodology is excellent. The only section that I would recommend is to wide the differential equation section because it was poor in this subject. I have been out of school for about ten years and I need more material in order for me to ketch up. Other that the problems are well explain and plenty of problem for the student.
5,Excellent FE Review Book,"16 years after college graduation, I used this FE Review Manual and passed the 2008 FE exam. Since I am working full time and 60% of the topics I am not familiar with, I spent 2 hours/day for 6 six months. All the efforts finally paid off! During my preparation for the exam, I gained more and more confidence through working on practice examples. The actual exam is easier than the practice examples, and you need to be familiar with the NCEES Handbook. Though I am very good at maechanical design, kinematics and vibration, I am not familiar with thermo and fluid. I took the Genral Exam in the afternoon instead of Mechnical Engineering Exam, and I did well.I planned to take the PE exam october 2009 and will use Michael's books again. With all my dedication in learning, I should be able to pass the exam. I wish those who want to take the exam can pass the exam, but you need good book and dedication."
5,Great before and after test reference,"I found the book to be very complete and helpful. The example and practice problems were more than adequate to prepare me for the exam. Most often, the practice problems were much more difficult than the actual test problems.I studied for three weeks prior to the exam, and I have no doubts that I passed. This book was an invaluable resource during my preparation."
5,Very reliable and precise,Great review for EIT (FE) exam. The author even tells you how much change you need to bring in your pocket and is very focus on the engineering basics.
4,A Lot of Helpful Information,Information was very useful but make sure you start more than 1 week ahead of time to get it all.
3,Why all the amazing reviews?,"This book is mediocre at best. At first you might think it's brilliant because it has practice problems (which is a good thing), but the formulas it uses do not match up with the formulas that are found in the FE Reference Manual (a formula book you get during the test). If they do match up, they are written differently using different, and simpler notation. This comes up a lot while doing practice problems because the book pulls out formulas from its a$$ and it seems so easy but since they're not in the formula book, you wouldn't necessarily be able to replicate it on your own. The book also uses formulas it discusses at the beginning of each chapters (and some of these are also not in the reference manual) so this all gets very frustrating."
5,Go for it!!,"This is an excellent book. I wish I had taken the exam before, now as years have passed it's harder to remember many things but this book helped!!"
5,Very helpful,"This book does a very good job in reminding you the basic principles of the subjects tackled in the FE exam. The problems are more difficult than the actual morning exam problems, so if you study, you are well prepared for the morning session and relatively ready for the afternoon one. It is also organized in small chapters so you can study selectively if you can't study everything."
5,"Very good book, thoroughly written, covers all topics","The book covers all the topics needed for FE exam preperation and there are plenty of practice questions to test yourself also. I used this book and did very well on the FE exam, the result has not been announced yet but I am hopeful I will pass. The main thing to remember is to allow yourself plenty of preparation time. The material and the practice questions are all here in the review manual but you will need several months to follow the preparation schedule the book proposes - so start early!"
3,Large but not clear,"more explanations and clearer path of description and priority of subjects is needed, some subjects are discussed and explained in this book briefly which makes it hard to understand the purpose or use of some information or equations in practical engineering, other than that , the book has a lot of mathematical derivation that is not needed to be mentioned for engineers who has studied them in college, this book also lacks graphs and explanation diagrams that would make it worth more and more efficient."
5,Book Review,The bbok was in good condition and arrived just on time. Everything about the transaction was excellent
3,Not Bad,"This book isn't too bad of a review tool. The description states that it will take about an hour to review each chapter, but this does not include working the practice problems. If you choose to work those, as you should because the text does not provide enough information for a detailed review, it will take closer to 4 hours per chapter. Also, the solutions sometimes skip steps making it difficult to follow the logic of the solution. All in all, this is a good review resource, but plan far a head and do not wait until the month before the test to begin."
3,"Well, it gives you an idea","This book does give you an idea of what to expect from the FE, but the questions are more difficult then the ones on the actual test. I have recently taken the FE and passed it, but not really due to this book. While this book is excellent for anyone who has been out of school for awhile, if you are still in school or just graduated you should be fine. I would suggest getting a discpline specfic review book more, before this book. Dont get me wrong though it helps but not much."
5,Best way to pass the FE Exam,This is the best book to pass the FE Engineering Exam. It's a great way to understand the exam and be prepare to the exercises.I took the exam for the first time and pass the exam.Got to have it.
5,Good Study Guide,Preliminary findings are that this is a thorough study manual. I am hopeful that it will aid in success in testing.
5,The F.E.'s perfect review book.,"A year and a half out of school, I took the F.E. exam and passed it this past October (first try!), and I couldn't have done it without this book. I did not take the afternoon General session, but I thought the book was very representative of the morning session's topics.Advice:1. Just skim the chapters you know (for me, math, chemistry and the computer topics), and commit at least 2 nights to each subject you feel you don't fully understand.2. If you are not taking the General test in the afternoon session, you will not need to look at some of the chapters! Compare the AM General and PM General topics, and if you are not planning to take the PM General test, DON'T even bother looking at chapters that aren't mentioned with the AM topics! [...] has the topic lists for the F.E. This will save you a few weeks (as you will be able to skip several chapters) and headaches (as many of the chapters I struggled with were not even listed on the AM session's topics)."
2,this is the fudge album to avoid,"lsd is not as popular these days,and you'd need it to stomach this recording..this is awful.buy rennaisance,the first album,and the new album ""the return"" to hear vintage bogert and appice jam"
2,Good for a laugh,"One of the most unintentionally hilarious albums of all time, a testament to dangers of mixing quaaludes and megalomania. The Fudge use Sonny Bono's ""The Beat Goes On"" to trace the history of music and Western Civilization, culminating in triumphant statements from the band, e.g.: ""When we're onstage, I feel like we're making love to the audience.""The Beatles medley is awful, the World War II audio collage pointless. But once you hear the Fudge disemboweling Beethoven's ""Moonlight Sonata"" you'll be on the floor in stitches. And the liner notes are good for a howl too.I don't know if this is worth paying 12 bucks for but if you find a used LP for 50 cents, by all means pick it up."
1,Has not dated well,"I really like the Fudge CD Renaissance (1968)and decided to check out this CD, Beat Goes On.I don't like writing negative reviews but this CD is not listenable. I really don't like all the quotes and Nazi speeches included in a collage of sound and ambiance.It may have been very hip back in 1968 but it really does not work for me.I'm a huge fan of music from the 1960s and love weird and strange music but this is not either.The quality of the playing however is 1st class as expected from this band."
3,Interesting Experiment From The Best Cover Band In The World,"I've had this album for years and years but have only listened to it maybe twice. I burned it to CD and tried again. After hearing it once more, I can say that though it's an interesting concept, this piece of music just doesn't have much appeal.To tell the truth, I am not sure if the Fudge have ever done an original song, but when it comes to interpreting covers, there is nobody better. I just don't think this is their best example. It is a quirky experiment with a theme and though I can give it five stars for originality, I can only give it three stars for the overall effect. This certainly isn't Tommy."
1,A Landfill,"I love Vanilla Fudge, and just got this album. It has to be the disappointment of the decade. It sucks. It's full of covers, tedious sections, speaking, filler, just plain crap all around. The few places it sounds like they are going to pick up the pace, they don't.I think these guys might have been on something bad when they recorded this one!Save your money, and if you are actually a VF fan like me, be sure to get Vanilla Fudge, Renaissance, Near The Beginning and Rock & Roll. All great albums, but this one is terrible."
2,"High noon, Hi friends","A previous reviewer noted there was ""nothing on it that could receive air play"" and I am basically in agreement -- with an exception. When I went off to college (Ann Arbor) in 1968, the DJ on the local FM radio station started his shift at noon, and always began by playing a minute-long catchy little song, after which he would announce his arrival by saying ""High noon, hi friends."" I liked the short little song, but had no idea of the title (there were no lyrics) or artist, so I wrote to him and asked. The answer was ""Phase 2: The Beat Goes On"" by Vanilla Fudge. It's entry number 7 on the track list above, and I believe the first song on the second side of the album I bought. I've always liked it, but was never sufficiently stoned to appreciate anything else on the album."
2,The most pretentious LP of all time,"OK, my friends, just look at the track listing. Stare at it for a minute. This is a jumble of ""influences,"" including ""classics,"" sewed together to form a ""suite"" which is supposed to have some ""meaning,"" that being: boy, there's been a heck of a lot of music, hasn't there? The second star is for unintentional humor, especially when the boys give you their free-form poetry. Stick with their first album, a real classic."
1,The Beat Goes Out,"If you are a die-hard Vanilla Fudge fan and you have to have them all,then get it! But be carefull for this is not a conventional album. It is more of an experiment on music and speeches... Even the band recognize they went too far and released an album that was too weird! I really like this band,but this album is defenitly not to consider as a rock album. SO IF YOU WANT TO DISCOVER VANILLA FUDGE,DO NOT START WITH THAT ONE! If you like them so and so,don't waste your money on that cd and if you really love THE FUDGE...well go ahead!"
2,Do not mix ludes with...,"long studio sessions. If you want a truly incoherent album strung together in a twisted way, then this is it. If you don't, get Near the Beginning or Rock & Roll. Get some of their quality stuff. This definitely isn't it."
1,What is this?,"Questions:Who do they think they are?What are they trying to say?Why does it contain so little music?Are these some of the same artists who made decent music with each other and inother projects?Do they now look back at this ""creation"" with embarrassment?This old album will not see the light of day on my turntable again."
4,Sound of Speed Album,"V.F. were experiencing there heart felt satisfaction of having become one of the No. 1 psychedelic bands in the U.S. They decided to anchor their success by completing an album which speaks of generic musical success. From Mozart to In the Mood, thru WWII, and up thru the Beatles, the Beat Goes On. Great Concept, better than average harmony, good improvisation, but miles above where they should have been and tens of miles above the potential listener. In the Groove!"
3,"Good comparison of various techniques, nice display of software that provides them","Good overview. The Conditioning Plot and Biplot chapters are interesting. Table at the back of the book gives a nice overview of techniques/plots provided by various software programs. Could be updated to include Minitab, but saw some other interesting programs in the list."
5,The Best Book That I Have Read in Years!,"This is one good book. You are able to get the inside track onthe Marine Corps Force Recon(similar to Delta Force and Green Berets).In a South American country,San Tomas,a dictator who is fleeing the country tortures and kills two Force Recon team members.The dictator escapes and sets up house in Florida underthe protection of the U.S. government.After the U.S. governmentrefuses to punish the South American dictator for his crime,theForce Recon members gain revenge. As a result of their action they are hunted by the FBI,CIA,KGB,and Cuban intelligence.Thisresult in gun battles all over the map.There is nonstop action for the reader.The term Semper Fi gains new meaning after you read this fine book.This book is action packed and very readable at the same time.This is a must read."
5,An Execution of Honor,"I don't usually have the time to read a book at one sitting, but this one got me. The only other fiction books which rank with this one as a ""Can't Put Down"" in my recent memory are ""The Odessa File"" and Gresham's ""The Firm""."
5,Gripping Thriller,"This book grabbed me from the start, and never let up until the final page. It had everything a thriller should have---suspense, action, unexpected twists and turns of plot. It shocked me when some of the former Marines died---didn't expect it at all---and had me hoping that the rest would survive against the overwhelming force trying to hunt them down. Betrayed by the government they trusted as U.S. Marines, forced to take action against a murderer their country protected, and then hunted by that country as well as the Cubans, Russians, and assorted minions of the Cubans. It was one riveting tale!"
2,First time reviewers have let me down,"While browsing through action/adventure titles EXECUTION OF HONOR came up. ...While the premise is original the author should have handed it off to a better writer. The tale of a group of Force Recon Marines avenging the savage murders of their comrades should produce many thrills and surprises. Sadly, in the hands of Thomas Muldoon, this book generates none. The dialouge is staged and wooden, not at all real sounding. ... I never forgot the fact that I was reading a book and a poorly written one at that. ...Muldoon's hero, Joe Craig, is brillant to a fault. He is prepared for every single cotingency that arises. This succeeds in sucking all the suspense out of the story. I never feared for the heroes safety. True some of them are killed but I never became emotionally invested in them. I didn't care. Too much telling and not enough showing.The two stars are for a very good plot."
3,Gucci Watch,The watch was very nice - i liked it. However the leather band was not that great. The band ripped just after a week of wearing it.
1,I would like to get my money back,"Aday (Meat Loaf) did his best to ruin the show with his stupid on stage antics. His facial expressions were sick, he alienated the crowd by threatening to leave the stage, he altered the timing of key moments in the songs, and his showmanship was as bad as I have ever seen anywhere. The drummer was good, the lead guitar player was bad.The driving power of the band instruments, especially the lead guitar, was completely washed out. The orchestra added nothing. It is the worst concert DVD I have ever seen. I felt sorry for the people who went to the live concert. I will say that I had never seen a Meat Loaf concert before so maybe this is his normal live performance.I can understand his voice not being the same, but if he had skipped the antics and just performed the songs we all love it would have been great."
5,My husband's favorite candy,"I like Chuckles, but my husband LOVES them. They are his favorite candy. The fruit flavor is very pronounced and you are not just getting a mouth full of slightly flavored sugar. Compare them to any other fruit chew candy and they win every time. It was hard to find them in stores--I could only find them at Cracker Barrel Restaurant stores, so it was great to be able to get them at Amazon."
3,Enlightening and creative,"Quantum Mind is an interesting approach exploring the nature of conciousness. It is an interesting read although a bit wordy. Themes are stressed and repeated. The links between mind, physics and math seem profound. This reader found the mathematical reasoning enlightening but the physics seem somewhat vague. It is a worthwhile read for those interested in our minds connection to the universe."
5,Great tool for study and contemplation,"I first found this book in the library, and after I got into it I had own a copy because three weeks were just not enough time to read and comprehend it. Six hundred pages of study, research, and contemplation.I have never come across a book that integrates physics, mathematics, and psychology. Arnold Mindell does it really well and leads me to research topics along the way. Not only does he define but also shows us the greater reality that lies along side the one that we accept on daily, survival basis. I have only covered about 200 pages, but the author has opened my mind to a much richer world that I knew was there, but discounted it."
1,Dont waste your money on this,"This is a lousy book. The author is very stylistically skilled. Its a shame that she cant write on anything of substance. The result is a well written book about foolishness. The author should use her skills for something meaningful. This type of writing, that pervades our magazines and popular culture has probably had an extremely negative influence on gullible idiots. Our country is in trouble if the opinions expressed in the articles in this book represent any sizable amount of the population. I threw this book away after reading it. I wish I had not paid good money for it."
5,My relationship with Meghan,"I fell in love with Meghan while reading her book but our love was short-lived, as I'm not compatible with Meghan for reasons you can guess while turning these pages. It is the sort of love that doesn't leave you because it cannot ultimately be satisfying, but rather the kind of compromised love one would possess after the slow realization that the person one is planning marriage with is simply a little too much this or not quite enough that. I don't find Meghan arrogant or annoying, and I understand her repugnance for carpeting. I may not agree with all of her social and material preferences but I endlessly admire the conviction of her idiosyncratic nature. Meghan, if you're reading this: please do write again."
3,Read this book in bits...,"Meghan Daum is undoubtedly a skilled writer. She has a keen eye, when she uses it. She is also arrogant, a bit of a snob and very very young.I've been enjoying her essays in various magazines for some time now, and I was interested to learn that there is a collection of her writing, so I bought the book. As I started to read, I discovered that the essays started to run together in my mind. I was occasinally stopped short by her arrogance. When I read one essay at a time, these things did not happen, and I could go back to enjoying the fluently written, nicely observed essays about not much of anything. On the other hand, when I read them in a group, the weaknesses were more evident and the effect more of a whine.So, my advice is that if you like this kind of thing (smooth writing, essays making much of very little), you may well enjoy this book. I just urge you not to take the edge off by reading it all at once."
3,More of a snob than a wit,"Although many of her observations are dead-on, and I did enjoy a few of these essays, she too often comes across as an insecure, judgmental snob. It's fine to be self deprecating about her middle class, New Jersey upbringing, and I certainly understand her appreciation of and desire for a more refined existence, but when she lays into other groups who don't meet her high minded cultural standards she strikes me as mean spirited and immature. Her essay on her revulsion of wall to wall carpet and how she uses carpet as criteria to dismiss and judge immediately wore thin and made her appear shallow and a little pathetic. Perhaps she has to cling to her standards of superficial elitism and judge others because that's all she has, besides a mountain of debt accrued from trying to maintain this image."
4,The Best Of The Lost Years,"By far the best of the four 'Lost Years' books. Good action, good character development, (ever wondered how ol' Pavel wound up going from navigation to security? Wonder no more!) and a great story. Highly recommended."
5,Superb story focussing on second-tier characters.,"This is a marvellous story, well-conceived and well-executed, focussing on Uhura, Sulu, and Chekov. Not for fans of the usual ""big three"" of Star Trek; Kirk and McCoy make only cameo apprearences, (as do Scotty, M'Benga, Chapel, and Rand) and Spock makes none at all, but for anyone who enjoys seeing the lower-ranking characters get a bit of developement, this book is delightful."
3,These Winds Don't Blow,"As Trek books go, Traitor Winds is a stand-out. Briskly paced, well-written, and characters as true to the originals as in any TOS novel. The plot is in many ways a liberal re-working The Undiscovered Country, with Enterprise crewmembers framed for a conspiracy involving high levels of the Federation and Starfleet, and a denouement at a peace conference to boot. But don't let that deter you from a fine, entertaining read."
3,Didn't fit.,The site said it was the right size. The package said it was the right size. It wasn't. The opening in the side that attaches to the tailgate was larger than the attaching bolt. I had to cut off the old ends and use them as a washer.
4,Pretty good little sun cap.,"Doesn't rattle at all, which is what I was looking for. Very easy to put on, just doesn't quite cover down to the top of the doors. Great for having that top off, though!"
1,"Save Your $$$ & Get Your Propaganda from ""Faux"" ""News"" & Talk Radio","The same tired, one-sided, misrepresented arguments that deceive only those made ignorant by their trust in sources parroting only one pole of the political spectrum, while calling itself centrist.At least expose yourselves to major media outlets, such as the BBC (After all, even they're considered conservative by many citizens of the other Industrialized nations)."
5,Good book,"Nancy and George join friends from a film-making class on a ship to film their upcoming pirate film. With George playing a brave female pirate and Nancy as director it's sure to be fun. That is, until a mysterious, dangerous string of events occurs, leaving the colourful cast and crew on edge and indangered. Nancy must solve the case before her time runs out!"
2,Unreliable rice cooker,"This company does honor the warranty, though it has failed three times in the last year. It just broke the third time so we plan on getting another brand. While it worked, it worked quite well. So it gets two stars for doing a job well (when it still worked) and a star for the honoring the warranty multiple times."
1,Piece of Junk and Dangerous,"Please make sure you do not buy this product. I understand Factory-Reconditioned means something happened to this before. However, I never imagined it turned out like this.The package arrived with following issues:- No Baking Pan, rack, instruction included in package- The paint on the front door of the Oven is scratched- I turned on the oven, it is incredible nosiy. With nothing in, since I got no pan and rack from them, the Oven burns and smokes with a terrible smell. It is super hot on the cover, and I think my counter will melt out of it.It is Dangerous. DO NOT BUY, no matter how cheap it is."
2,Refurb DeLongi toaster oven,"I purchased this item in October `05. It worked OK for a month. Then the lower heating element stopped heating. It has been in a DeLongi warranty shop for three months and is not repaired yet. DeLongi `Customer Service` has not been too helpful , saying only it takes time for parts to come from Italy!"
2,Not useful.,"This star atlas was much smaller than I expected and the poor contrast makes it difficult to see.I purchased this book to see how it compares to the Sky and Telescope magazine's Pocket Sky Atlas. The Sky and Telescope atlas is much larger, but easily handled in the field and has much better contrast."
3,Ok... :\,"I really thought i was going to like this book because i thought the ""Mates, Dates.."" series is really good! Everything in this book is so..expected, like you know what is going to happen next, which does not make for a very interesting read. It was the same old, ""OHH i LOVE him but i can't tell! I'll break someone's heart! OH NO! What am i going to do!?"" Seriously..this book isn't very worth reading (which i figured out after i read it). But i guess if you are a fan of the ""Mates, Dates.."" series then you could read it. This series just isn't the same though."
4,Another response to below,"First of all, please do not write a review for a book if you can not spell. (Ps. They're, not there) Secondly, please support all the statements with facts without giving too much information. I am sorry everyone this was how to for writing a review."
5,Oro cubano,"If you're one of those looking for pure, authentic Cuban music wihout the stridency of a huge wind section and with a powerful social content, this CD is for you. The album starts with Carlos Puebla's anthem, his eulogy to Che, a battle cry for many Latin American struggling for justice. Charged with political connotations, this CD, however, has the sweet taste of the son cubano, one of the most melodic and yet contagiously rythmical tunes in Latin America. The entire CD ends up being one of the most heartful homages to Cuba and its people that you may ever listen to."
3,It was Okay...,"Somewhat predictable and some bad acting by the husband (Rob). Overall it was okay for a 'B' movie.Some of you may remember Alexandra Paul who played on Baywatch, now she did deliver...job well done. Oh yeah, the 'lover' was a hottie also.Rent it, but don't spend alot to buy it."
3,Dragons are usually a little faster moving,"My favorite genre is sci-fi and action, so I found this book a bit slow for my tastes. I bought it to read for a book club to which I belong and I have to admit the book was interesting as a character study, written nicely, and a good cultural study."
4,Loved it. Now what?,"I recently finished this book and loved the way it was written, the use of language, the lessons of enduring truths of humanity, etc. It was very touching and I loved it. I read it aloud to my 16-year-old son. We have read a lot of books but now I'm stuck and need a recommendation on what to read next."
3,Not as heavy as I thought it would be.,"It's ok, but I thought I was getting a much heavier cable than what I actually got, so I feel it is slightly misrepresented. Also, it does not have the spring on it as shown in the picture, but that is ok because I never really liked the spring on the tie out I had before (similar to this one, but with red coating) that broke. This one would be better suited for my 30 lb. beagle than it is for my Leonberger, but since she doesn't pull on it at all, it works ok for her. My 30 lb beagle pulls a lot and is strong for his size, and this one would be ok for him. If you have a large dog, say, over 60 lbs that pulls on the cable, you will want a stronger cable than this one. The beagle pulls a lot and this size would be better suited for him than the one I first bought for him. These tie outs require constant supervision, because no matter what they advertise, they are NOT tangle free."
5,a book to grow up with,"This book is about a ten year old girl who is an orphan and is passed from family member to family member, but she does not really fit anywhere. She is a bit of a tom-boy, which is why they call her Miss Maloo - to help her be a lady.The book chronicles her adventures as she attempts to conform and be a lady. But it's also a book about values, friendship and what is important over the long haul, and especially, the nature of family.I read this book, picked up at a yard sale, over and over again, and as an adult, still think about it. It deals with the important issues in life in a hilarious but realistic way. You can imagine all the scenarios really happening in someone's life.Don't miss the tea party scene as Miss Maloo once again, tries to be a lady, serving tea and conversation to her friends with unexpected results..."
5,This is a must for new parents!,"This book is a must for every new parent and also a very good guide for all parents.Here's what I like about the book:1) It covers almost everything I was worrying about: (Parenting, newborn, feeding, clothing, outings & travel, nappies, bathing, sleeping, crying, playing, learning, development, safety.. and more)2) It's a practical guide from birth to 3 years.3) It has only the information you really need and does not have those tons of words you don't have time to read and you'll not actually use!4) It has colored pictures when it is needed to show you how to deal with your baby.5) It is easy to read and carry.I don't see any cons in this book, it's just what I needed and now I feel much more confident."
3,Good resource,"This book is a good resource for new parents. It's to the point and doesn't take long to read. I think it could use a little updating, but overall it's a great resource."
4,"good book, but some errors","for the most part, this is a great book... many wonderful pictures. However, the cockpit shots on pgs 36-37 are from a B-777, and there are a number of detail errors on how certain systems work. (I am rated on the B-757/767) Not many glaring errors, but enough small ones that make one wonder about the accuracy of the data that I am not familiar with. Perhaps the author should have had a better editor/data checker read the book before publication. overall, a good book...."
3,"Right size, wrong holes","I purchase these sheets to augment my photo albums purchased on Royal Caribbean. They are the right size, but I had to punched holes closer to the center since these weren't at the right place. However these are the only ones of the size that I found in weeks or research!"
2,Beware of shipping costs,"I ordered six of these, along with 2 albums, and they came from Adorama camera. After they arrived I discovered that the shipping cost was extremely high. Their policy is to charge shipping on each individual item, even though, of course, they are all sent in one package. I complained and got a partial refund on the charges, but the way they do it is clearly a rip-off."
5,great flick!!,"Really good stuff! A very insightful and entertaining doc. I was surprised, as an American, how little I actually knew about Johnny Appleseed. A very balanced look at his impact on the American landscape."
1,False warnings 4x per week,"This device caused multiple, multiple false alarms in the few weeks I used it. Every time, my concerned neighbors called various people in my family to come and check. Nothing was ever wrong. We eventually discovered that as the temperature went UP, the light went on, as if it has been wired incorrectly. Inaccurate and unreliable, I returned it."
1,Don't buy,"I have had two of these over the past ten years, and they both cause ""false alarms"". I test all freeze alarms outdoors on the porch, before I use them. One is out there now. It's set for 32*, the temperature is 46* and the light is on. It's inaccurate and erratic. Don't trust it just because it's Honeywell. It's junk. Freezeups can be expensive. Look for something else and test it before you trust your home to it."
5,Aftermarket exaust that fits perfectly,"Purchased the Gibson Exaust for 1990's thru mid 2000's Ford Ranger,Mazda B4000 ext cab/shortbed. This exhaust system was extremely easy to install & fit surprisingly well.Installation instructions were clear but don't go by the orentiation of the muffler on the composite diagram of the system. Some one photoshopped or pasted the muffler in backwards. Look at the individual photo instruction diagrams. When it's installed right the Gibson label on the muffler is not upside down. I like the subtle deeper tone that comes with it's use & the 0-20 mph response is much smoother. For a true check on vehicles that these fit, go to the Gibson website. Amazon claims that it doesn't fit the B4000 but that's an error in their system. Perfect fit for Ranger or Mazda truck."
4,Very nice but I didn't find the authors I expected,"Instead of Luc Tuymans, Anton Chekhov, Vratislav Effenberger, Milton Hatoum, Andrie Platonov, Victor Pelevin, Rebecca Solnit, I found in this issue of Grand Street (no 64) contributions of David Mamet, Suzan Lori Parks, José Saramago, Tony Smith, Tennesse Williams and Pablo Neruda"
5,"""About Time"" is aptly named.","This excellent album by Winwood takes us back to the days of the Spencer Davis Group and Traffic. By that I mean it is heavy on the Hammond B3 Organ and percussion. Gone are the ""Top Forty"" pop hits of the 1980s. This album is the strongest work by Winwood in years and features longer pieces with excellent keyboard work. I am so glad I bought this cd. Everything about it is top notch. Winwood has assembled a group of musicians that contribute strongly to the set. The songs are well written, the guitar and drum work are very good and, above all, Winwood does an incredible job of bringing the B3 organ to the forefront. If you are a Winwwood fan and haven't purchased this album, do so. You will find ""About Time"" to be the most enjoyable album you have heard in years."
2,Memo board,Color is much more yellow compared to picture. A lot of fraying of the material around the edges. Pictures hide the color and most of the fraying. It does the job.
5,Couldn't be happier,Awesome buy. I received the unibit days after ordering and for half the price of home depot or any supply house and product is exactly what it said it was
5,"A good text, from someone who hates textbooks...","This book was great, it was required for my Anthropology course on global tourism. I felt like it was an easy read and a good well rounded collection of case studies and papers both classic and contemporary. It was easy enough to get through without bogging you down too much in jargon but still used valuable meaningful language so it didn't feel dumbed down at all. A very enjoyable read."
4,Works with Boot Camp and Fusion (partly),"I bought this because I wanted to run that one application from work that doesn't run on Mac OSX. Using Boot Camp, I created a Windows partition on my mac, and then installed this version of XP. It ran great. I recommend continuing to shut down and restart over and over to be sure all the updates are installed. Fusion can then boot from the Boot Camp partition. The downside is that Microsoft seems to think I installed XP on another machine (the virtual one) and won't let me register (I'm still in the 30-day grace period). I haven't called them yet to try to resolve the issue. It does run great using Boot Camp (my mac is the fastest, prettiest Windows machine I've ever used)."
4,MS Windows XP Home Edition SP28,I needed this product so my home computer was compatible with the forms used in my job.
2,Extremely Disappointed,"I purchased this product because I thought the string light would work well under the dash of a 1992 Buick Lesabre, which has a perfect little groove for the light to follow.There are two bad things about this product. First, it is a DISGUSTING light blue not anything like the color that Pilot advertises. Secondly, the cigarette adapter provided makes an annoying humming sound while they are plugged in. If I hadn't got the item so cheap I would have returned it."
5,Hans Kelsen is extremly successful in buliding his Theory,"""Pure Theory of Law"" is a classic and a must for Law and Philosophy students. Hans Kelsen is extremly successful in building concepts and also his theory. Although this ""pure theory""is extremly criticised nowadays, its reading is essential ,and help readers to understand other theories clearly."
2,Languague.,"It is great that this book has been translated to the English language.However, some customers would prefer the German version."
3,Don't go by the picture !,Thought a green hose would blend in nicely accross the grass. It arrived black. Oh well.-- At least it's rubber.
3,"Good, but not great","This lens was a great add on for the XHA1, but honestly I am not impressed when comparing the footage I've captured on less cameras with the Raynox lenses. NO THREADS on the front means, no filters for the Canon lens. It's also a bit heavy. Good for what it is, just not great."
2,Should Not Have the Canon Name on the Lens,"It works as advertise, but that is about all. This adapter is not even close to the glass that is already on the the camera (XHA1). There is a day and night difference in the sharpness of the image. But saying all that, I still use it on every shoot."
5,Start your adventure with Calvino here,"This is a delightful masterpiece and the perfect introduction to the world of Calvino. It's episodic structure makes it easy to digest and the humor and irony are contagious. Whether it is guarding a ""secret"" stash of delectible mushrooms (with some regretful digestive consequences), trying to take a quick sunbath on a river barge at lunch hour, or suffering the endless glow of a nighttime neon sign, this book will never fail to satisfy. I was introduced to Calvino via this book - dive right in and take a swim, you'll get hooked too!"
3,"OK, I am italian and proud of it, but...","It is a nice book BUT my opinion is that it has been overrated, both in Italy and abroad.Calvino wrote something much better, like ""Il Barone rampante"", etc."
4,A pleasure to read,"This is a work that is simply magical to read. A collection of stories dealing with the imaginative dreamer, Marcovaldo, the book weaves a dreamscape around the protagonist's city life. Sometimes surreal, often funny, and sometimes poignant, Marcovaldo is a book that can work its way into your heart and remain with you. In the words of another reviewer who summed it up quite nicely: ""There is a little Marcovaldo in all of us."""
5,Great environmental story,"Calvino's ability to capture topics of humanity is relevant for people of all ages. In this story of a man in a poor industrial town, Calvino conveys eloquently the timeless struggle between nature and civilization."
4,wow,"did you know that only three percent of books published in the USA per year are translations of foreign literature? That's a real shame, because it means that books like Cavalcade can only be enjoyed by French speakers.Here's the plot. Poisson Chat, guitarist and Don Juan extraordinaire, is involved in a car crash that leaves him a quadruplegic. We find out how he, his family, and his numerous lovers react to his new condition.Sounds simple doesn't it? Maybe a little boring?Changes of perspective, internal dialogue, and a phenomenal cast of characters make Cavalcade anything but. I guarantee that at the very least you'll learn some interesting vocabulary.I really really enjoyed this book and I hope you do too."
3,Keep this book for future references,"The book I purchased "" The Essentials of Academic Writing"" was spot on. It 's a book that I can use in the future.The only thing that's bothersome is that my professor is not using it in his class, go figure."
4,A Great Marriage/Love Affair Gone Wrong.,"I have always enjoyed reading a celebrity's autobiography and Sheila MacRae's was no exception. Having been born long after the success of MacRae's famous husband, Gordon in 1960, I was unfamilar with his films as well as Miss MacRae's credits as an actress. Through this autobiography, I read with great interest as wellas great sadness, over a man and woman who weredeeply in love, but destroyed by Gordon's alcoholism and excessive gambling. The bright spots are MacRae's close friendship with LucilleBall, some revealing insight into her friend Cary Grant's love life, and the Hollywood parties attended in their heydey. After reading the book, I emerged an admirer of both Sheila and Gordon MacRae."
3,"Walks Like Fiction, Talks Like Fiction...","This book is a fun ride. However, if you've read a lot of celebrity bios, you'll be turned off, as I was, at how MacRae appropriates various anonymous and ancient showbiz stories as her own personal experiences.For example, she has a lover defending her to a foe by saying, ""What she has, you used to have. And what she has, you can't spell."" Nice line, but it's from a movie.The whole book has a goofy, made-up quality - even more than the usual Hollywood autobiography. Rather than trying to paint herself as the innocent waif (as June Allyson tried to do in her autobiography), MacRae bends over backwards (a-hem) to sex up her image.With a huge grain of salt, it's a fun, juicy read. And I wouldn't trust one word of it as far as I could throw the publishing house."
2,Golden voice/Blabber mouth,"""Oh, by the way, I was once married to ....""; now can I tell ya all about my life?"" There. Do you feel like reading this superficial analysis of a Hollywood marriage run amok? I didn't think so. Typical, feminist retro-look at the past when Sheila was a part of the dinner club circut power couple come unglued. Trivializes the highs(1950's),depicts the 1960's as the rise of a multi-talented what, dancer/singer, when groups were in vogue?Granted, survival was key here, but I wanted to know more about the golden-voiced Gordon MacRae and what became of his gifts that, among other things, launched her. Not to be. Ended up being about as interesting as a Matt Helm bedroom farce,with the reality glossed over and the reality of what once was unrevealed."
4,Great Reference,"A great reference, covers suggestions on how use the herbs and spices. Wonderful pictures. I used it to help me select plants for my garden this year."
4,Great Book!,"I personally like recipe books and cook companion guides that are visually appealing, functional, and thoughtfully written. This guide does it all. Great for referencing while you cook or simply just sittig down to read. A great buy. Especially useful for discovering proper spice pairing."
1,HOW ABOUT A LITTLE QUALITY CONTROL!!!!!!!!,"The book itself is really good, beautiful, informative and well laid out.But inside it has NUMEROUS CREASED PAGES!!Also the PAGES are NOT CONNECTED to the SPINE, making it only a short matter of time until they all fall out.I should have bought a used one, it would probably be in better condition.I feel ripped off. Probably the last new book I purchase."
5,Not just a reference book,This book goes back to the roots of seasoning and with great authenticity. It is not just a reference book but truly inspirational and a must have for anyone that creates and experiments in the kitchen.
5,Everything you will ever need to know about the spice world,Everything you will ever need to know about spices ot the world. A must have if you love to cook.
5,very impressed,This is a wonderful book with very informative text and graphics. This is a great gift book for anyone who enjoys cooking or gardening.
5,Excellent source,"This book has lots and lots of pictures and loads of information on a large selection of herbs and spices. Some of them are non-traditional...which in my opinion only add to its value. There are a few reciepes, but this isn't really a cook book...it's a reference book for ideas."
5,Beautiful book!,"This book is a joy to look through--the photos are very clear and colorful. You can see exactly what a certain herb or spice looks like without question. Also, the herbs and spices covered in the book are placed in groups according to similar qualities such as sweet, bitter, pungent and so on. The author has included many herbs and spices from around the world as well as the ones we are most familiar with in this country. I first saw this book in our local library and checked it out and decided that I just had to have a copy! As well as being so lovely to look at and informative (the basics of how to prepare and use), there are many recipes included at the end for dishes using herbs and spices and for making seasoning mixtures. Lots of good information for herb and spice lovers."
5,great buy for my needs,can't believe I got the book for such reasonable price and prompt service with delivery
4,Good short read,"I read this book basically because it was set in England. The book read really fast and the dialogue between the characters was very interesting. There was one thing that I never saw coming...and it was such a shock! I will not spoil it by telling it here, but it really made things interesting. I have to say I was quite taken with Jack Logan and his dog, Bran, and not the fact he was a millionaire. He just seemed very manly to me."
5,beautiful legitimate celtic knots,"The ring fits perfectly, it is simple and elegant, so it goes with everything. The Celtic knots are beautiful and the design is unique. I am a huge fan of Celtic and Irish jewelry and I am very pleased! Be sure to use a silver cleaner and to clean in the crevices. Its wonderful."
5,Silver Celtic Heart Ring,"Absolutely wonderful--bought it as a pinkie ring, and it fits perfectly. The design is raised enough to be eye-catching, but not so high that it catches on things when you are working around the home or yard. Just love this ring!"
5,Trinity Knot Ring,It was in very good condition. The shipping was very fast and i got it within a couples of days of ordering the ring. I have no complaints what so ever.
4,As beautiful as the picture,"I was shopping on Amazon for this exact Item. A Celtic ring that was silver, in expensive, and beautiful. Silver Insanity had just what I was looking for, and at a great price too! 11.99! :) I was thrilled. The Ring arrived in a small box with a black velvet back around it; very elegant. I will deffinately order from Silver Insanity again. Thankyou!"
1,Very pretty.. until it starts turning your finger black,"It is a really pretty ring, aye? It is pretty in person, but only good for short term wear. I wore it overnight and by the time I woke up I had a black ring around my finger. If you have the time and patience, I hear you can coat metal in clear nail polish and then it wont change. But I'm kind of mad I paid $17 for a ring that turns my skin.The one plus to this? The size 11 was a real size 11."
5,Beautiful ring,"Beautiful ring,but way too big for my fingers. I probably need to oorder a child's size to get the right fit."
3,"Pretty, but the picture looks prettiER","When I first spotted this ring, I really liked the design of this and it sorta has this similar type of style that my bf had given me as a promise ring. This ring is cute, but it really wasn't what I expected... this picture made the ring look 3D but in reality, the actual ring itself is somewhat...flat...not flat as in the ring is flat and you can't really wear it, but flas as in..the ring's design and its thickness is different. In the picture, the ring's knot design looked thicker and more fuller. The actual ring has a 2D look, where the design has no thickness. It's thin and flat like a 2D drawing compare to a 3D drawing. It was quite a little bit disappointing.. I was thinking of wearing this for its looks sometimes, but looking at my promise ring makes this ring look real cheap."
5,Cute,Very shiny unlike other sterling silver I own. If the other reviews weren't so good I would worry that it isn't sterling. Love the ring hate the shipping but I needed a size 3 and couldn't find one anywhere else. If the ring holds up I will order another style of size 3 from the seller. The ring is big enough for any finger in my opinion and larger than I would normally wear on my pinkie but I already got over that! -- Lots of compliments on the ring. I do love it but on my pinkie that is where the eye goes and the ring outshines anything else on that hand. The ring is holding up very well.
4,"Lovely, delicate ring","I purchased this ring for my teen aged niece. She loved it. It isn't a terribly large ring, it is delicate and very attractive on the finger. She wears a size 11 and it did not look too small on her hand. The metal work is good, no rough edges or unfinished looking areas. This is a very good ring for someone who wants something feminine and delicate, not large or thick.This is the second ring I have purchased from Silver Insanity(the other is a sapphire trinity knot ring which my niece absolutely adores. It is gorgeous). They are so quick shipping out my purchase! I will definitely buy from Silver Insanity again. Both rings were well made and looked more expensive than they were. I liked that the ring comes in a little velvety bag and comes with a paper to use if there is any need to exchange the ring. Great service, great product. Thanks!"
5,Lovely,"Have bought this ring twice, the first time it was too small. It is very pretty. The heart and knots are not chunky looking, but instead are very feminine. I use it as a toe ring. It has bent out of the round, but this was a plus for me because now the decoration stays on the top of my toe instead of sliding to the underside. I never take it off."
2,Disappointed,"It's a pretty ring and very dainty, the price was right but the only problem which is a big problem to me is that it turns your finger green. If it wasn't for turning your finger green it would easily be 5 stars but unfortunately I could only give it 2"
2,Nice ring but,This is a very pretty ring but am very disappointed.....gave this to my granddaughter for Christmas and it was turning her finger green by the end of the day. Very surprising since all other silver items I've purchased have been great.
4,"Just what I expected, n Happy!","Was exactly what is pictured, fits perfectly, and is get nice quality! I would recommend to others! Definately a good buy."
2,Returned it.,"I'm a little surprised that all reviews are 4 or 5 stars right now. I was quite disappointed with this ring. It is pretty, but it is so lightweight it feels almost flimsy. I had intended to give it as a gift, but no way. It has the feel of a ring that came in one of those plastic bubbles from a 50 cent toy machine in the supermarket - so back it went. Too bad - the design is nice and it is shiny silver. And I wear a lot of silver jewelry, so I generally have reasonable expectations in this price range. This one didn't live up to them, unfortunately."
3,cute...but not worth the price,"Just recieved this ring today. It looks just like the picture and is very cute, but is not worth the money that i spent on it. On the up side, shipping was fast with no prob. cute ring, but I could have bought it at somewhere like claire's for much less..."
5,Beautiful,"I have had this ring for almost a year now, and I must say that it is absolutely fabulous. It is the perfect size, not too large or too small. It has yet to show wear, even though I wear it daily. The design is delicate and meaningful, and I would definitely recommend this ring to anybody who asked!"
5,I really like my new ring!!,"This is a sweet little ring! It is perfect, does not sit too high, so it does not get caught on things.Very pretty. Shipped quickly, like dealing with Silver Insanity!"
4,Pretty but band can bend,"I've had this ring for four or five years now and I never take it off. It still looks great - sometimes lotion or soap will get caught in the little holes in the knots but they always wash out after a day or two. The band is bent though but its not noticeable when I wear the ring and you look at it straight on - it just looks funny when you look at it from the palm side of my hand. I would still recommend this ring, the design is too pretty to pass up!"
1,blue/green skin,"Turned my girlfriends finger blue on first day that she wore it. It is advertised as sterling silver, while she has owned other sterling silver rings that have not had that effect."
5,I am in Love,This ring is fantastic! It looks just like it does in the picture! I would highly recommend this if you wants some type of Celtic Jewelry.
5,Another great Celtic ring,My wife loves thing ring I bought her. She wears it on her pinky. The ring is high quality and makes a nice addition to an Irish Celtic ring collection. We love the Celtic heart design.
4,A bargain.,The packaging of the ring could have been better. A little ring box would be nice.The heart on the ring is a bit oblong.I've grown to like this ring a lot and wear it on my pinky all the time.The back of the heart area is tarnished a bit.It is stamped with the .925 and it has not given me any weird green markings or such.For that price the ring is really pretty. Would buy again!
1,Cheap material,I bought this as a gift for my sister and it broke. The band is too thin (palm side) and the material was too weak.
2,"great product, sketchy service","don't get me wrong, this is a beautiful ring. i ordered it in a size 8, but the company sent me a size 6. i figured it wouldn't be a big deal; i'd just contact the company and make an exchange. i've e-mailed them 3 times over the last month and they have been neglecting to reply. their jewelry is beautiful, but their customer service isn't."
1,Never got it,I know is a GREAT ring...unfortunatelly it was shipped on USPS and we never got it....they show they delivered...on saturday...we do not work on saturday and it is the adress at my work......
5,Excellent.,"Nice weight, good rebound. Feels good and it is sturdy, I recommend it for anyone trying to improve their skills. Good product."
1,Bad,All I can say. Bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad.!!!!!
4,great,Great idea book for Vacation Bible School or children camp or birthdays. Even good ideas for parties of all ages.
1,uninteresting,"Sorry, the games were totally odd and even at that none that I would even want to investigate or play."
4,Minor gems,"The sound and picture quality of the film prints and the digital transfers are excellent. The films, though not major works and often find Mr. Sellers in supporting roles, are quite enjoyable for fans of late 1950's British comedy. (Terry Thomas is often more fun to watch than Peter Sellers.)"
5,I'm Alright Jack,"This old, very funny movie, is on TCM this weekend at 7am (Pacific) on Sunday Nov. 1st. 2009."
4,awesome,"I liked this book but then I love romance. It was well written, believable and detailed. I like the two main characters and the things they have to go through to be together,she also uses these two characters in other books. Loved it."
4,Turn Back Time,I have read 90% of Radclyffe books and I love them some more than others. This book because I am in the medical field felt real. The love between the women as usual in her books seems geninue. I loved it!
4,A powerful text for death penalty opponents,"A persuasive argument against the death penalty, with details that will and should horrify people. It includes more details about the actual legal processes and precedents involved than the other book by him that I read, The Autobiography of an Execution. I'd give this one five stars but for the fact that it's very repetitive; the same facts get mentioned in several different chapters. I think perhaps a lot of what's in this book came out of articles Dow wrote previously, which would explain the repetition."
5,well run,"This was quite a while ago and i gave the review as soon as i received it.in short, 5 stars, will definitely buy from seller again; sorry, i cant recall the name off hand. if i heard it id know it.hap snyder"
5,runners/walkers log,"I have been an avid walker for 18 years and have used this log for the last five - the same motivation works for walkers as it does runners - I log the weather, my mood, how my body felt - it is a great tool to keep you motivated - thank you"
3,"Just what I was looking for, however","Just what I was looking for, however the CD case was completely destroyed. I had to go out and get a case for the DC."
2,"good idea, poor product","item does nor work as advertised. ordering and shipping were first rate, but product is not useful. perhaps the lesson is to pay a lot more and get a lot more performance. this gadget simply amplifies everything, particular background noise all around you. the small plastic cone is adornment only, neither focusing nor clearing the sounds. Do not recommend."
4,The end of an era.,"I've been a big KofQ fan ever since the series started and thought that this was a pretty good end to it. In and of itself, it was a good season, but compared to the others, I didn't think it was quite as good. Some of the storylines were a little forced and it seemed like they were sort of forcing us along to the end, but even so, it was still enjoyable. I'm just sorry that the series had to end."
4,not the best.....,"The only reason I give this review 4stars, is the last season wasn't thebest in writing, I thought. Dont' get me wrong, I love the King of Queens,one of my most fav. shows. Just thought the writers were all over the place with Doug&Carrie;, and no one who watched the show, wanted to see them apart...As the end came, the writers did what everyone who watched the show wanted,have them together....The last show was great.....As a season, not as good as past years."
5,King of Queens DVD,This product was a good product and lovely for a King of Queens collector. Great price.
1,Something that is lost,"I just started to watch the last seasonin re-runs I have to say, there should not been a ninth season.Everything was thrown out of whackReally dumb stories character re-writen historythe adoption really , really idiotic,. For Carriescharacter, wanting to adopt a child,? she hated kids for mostfor entire series. In the real world she would not make goodmother nor doug a good father. He probably leave the babyon top of the car, going to pizza hut.If you love King Of QueensI would ignore the last seasonAnd consider the 8th season the last."
3,"Loved the series, but this season is probably my least favorite.","Seasons 5, 6, 7, & 8 are fantastic, but this season (#9) seems to lose a lot of direction. Not all that funny, the characters seem to kind of ""venture off on their own"". And the last couple of episodes are downright confusing."
5,king of queens season 9,"The king of Queens dvd sets are excellent. Very funny, loaded with laughs. The discs are in great condition - no stopping or skipping words as some do."
3,The King of Queens: The Complete Ninth Season,"The 9th season was not a great season. Definitely not as funny a previous seasons. Also, because the 9th season was much shorter than the rest, the price of the DVD set should have been significantly lower."
5,LONG LIVE THE KING!.......AT LEAST ON DVD!,"This is the final season of one of my favorite shows in the last 10 years. If your a fan of the series your going to buy this set. I usually buy the older classic shows but, this one is already a new classic in my eyes. The farewell season to the King....long live the King of Queens!"
3,More wide angle lens than a fisheye,"I ordered a fisheye lens and expected one. I was disapointed to see little to no fisheye distortion with this lens. However, it is a nice wide angle lens. So if you are looking for distortion this isnt the lens for you. If you want a nice wide angle lens, I would highly reccomend it."
5,Marvelous,This DVD is really good. My kids have been watching it in both languages English and Arabic. It is very well done and moving at the same time. I like this DVD so much since it teaches kids about the life story of the Prophet Mohammed peace be upon him in a beautiful and easy way with nice illustrations. I recommand it for all ages. It is really good and full of sincerity.....
1,Muhammad: The Last Prophet,This is a propoganda DVD to promote the acceptance of Islam. It is a childlike presentation with an obvious spin to present Muhammad positively and mentiions nothing of his barbaristic history.
5,Muhammed The Last Prophet Cartoon,Excellent Disney type film. Fun way for kids to learn about history! I am more than satisfied with this purchase!
5,For the whole family!,I loved this movie! It kept my 5 and 2 year old entertained and my husband and I enjoyed it as well. It gave us all a good understanding of what our prophet sacrificed for us!
3,OK for the cost,"It is a very lightweight aluminum level. I was hoping it would be a little more substantial. But for the money ($13), it is pretty hard to complain! The case will keep it from getting knocked out of alignment for a while."
4,Buy it.,"Wow, what a deal! It's a fine level, accurate and well worth $15. Even if you don't need a reliable 4ft level, someone on your crew does. Lifetime warranty from an excellent level maker, what else could you ask for?How bout a torpedo level and a hardcase? hehe."
2,Be careful,"Very hard to install. Be sure to get the correct channel. I thought I did, but I didn't. Now it's just junk for me. Also... It is not easily switched on or off, so when you put this on, be ready to live with it for a while."
2,"Does its Job, but","First, the good:1. Does it's job2. Does it well3. Stays inflatedNow, for the bad:NOT portable. Case and contents are both bulky and rather heavy, negating easy portability (and definitely a concern with International wweight limits on both checked and carry-on baggage). There is a definite market for a light weight, compact, wedge for those of us with GERD. This doesn't fill that need."
4,Sarbanes-Oxley IT Cmmpliance Using COBIT and Open Source Tools,"This book strikes a perfect balance between the theory and applicationnecessary for any IT Organization to effectively start to address theirSarbanes-Oxley requirements. It also presents the material in such a mannerthat non-IT professional can also benefit from the material. From getting abasic understanding of SOX to understanding what needs to be done to achievecompliance. I particularly found the "" CFO Perspective"" sections to beparticularly insightful and useful."
3,UTIL PARA SALIR DE DUDAS,"Cuando se tiene duda con esos modulos de encendidos DIS, es de gran ayuda, ya que evita que se compren modulos costosos para salir de dudas. Con este equipo no solamente prueba los modulos muertos, sino que tambien somete el modulo a diferentes RPM para saber si el modulo falla en altas revoluciones. Es muy sencillo y de construccion poco ortodoxa, pero de gran ayuda. Ademas tiene funcion de KV."
2,Yoga,This looks better online than in person. But I must say the customer service was remarkable. My money was refunded.
4,Looking at the bright side.,Mind power for childrenVery simple positive and interesting. An easy and captivating read with practical suggestions and out look.
3,Somewhat disappointing,"This book was a letdown after reading his ""Mind Power into the 21st Century (which I gave 5 stars). Nowhere hear as informative or helpful."
1,waste of money,"This buld bright less than the original. It started to smell burnt when I first turned on, and the head of flashlight fall down when I just rotate it a litle."
1,Leaves lint debris after swabbing,"This product left more debris after swabbing the sensor than I had prior to cleaning it! If you like to spend a lot of money for a product that does not deliver, this is for you."
2,Overpriced.....,This is a very handy product but the price for the amount of swabs you get is ridiculous. They should just give you one or two plastic swabs and more of the cloth tips pre-cut. Giving you several plastic wands with the fabric on them is stupid. I initially had to use these for my D300S Sensor but after cleaning I now only use a blower and Arctic Butterfly brush. They do work but they need to re-think their marketing.
3,Hit-and-miss,"A comprehensive account of the Church of England's Mission to the Church of the East in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which details successes as much as it does the many, sad, failures. Though a bit hard-going at times, and some cringe-inducing letters from the English about the so-called ""uncultured"" Assyrians [though we can't apply standards today back then, it still jarred for me], this is an in-depth account which helped fill in many gaps of my knowledge of this interesting Mission."
5,Pleased with my battery for my SCP-8400,"I was fortunate to find this battery online because I read other reviews that indicated they can be very expensive. I cannot remember the actual date I purchased the battery, but it had been a few months at least and the battery is working fine. Even if I had to replace this battery every six months, the price is right so I have no complaints, but I hope that it will continue to operate for at least a year."
4,Wonderful Book,This book is great the first time I read this I was confused as much as one can be. The first chapter will throw anyone for a loop. The entire book is questionable like if any of it really happened or was it all LSD induced babble. I'd recommend this to anyone that still has a piece of their brain untouched by the puppeteers.
3,Medium-grade lump,"I have to say I was a bit disappointed with this stuff. There are very few large pieces and it doesn't last as long as some brands. No problems lighting it or keeping it lit, though. Produces as much ash in my BGE as, say, off-the-shelf cheapie Kingsford or whatever. Not really worth ordering it online, there are better options out there."
2,Not Much,"This dvd was surprisingly short, and presented more of an outline or overview of the basic ideas behind the real food, slow food and anti-fast food movements. There were a few good lines here and there, but I was sadly underwhelmed. I recommend skipping this entirely in favor of drastically better options such asSuper Size Me,Fast Food NationorFood, Inc.For teens and young adults especially,All Jacked Upis a good option as well."
2,The Weakest of the VF Albums - For Fans Only!,"If you are a Fudge fan, you should have this in your library. If you're not, skip it. Their version of ""Windmills of Your Mind"" is quite good. The rest is, well, a hodgepodge. By this point they were putting together a product when they really weren't a unit anymore, by their own admission. They had split into factions, were showing up separately for sessions and were letting the producer run with it. As a result, the dynamic ""band"" sound that made the ""Vanilla Fudge,"" ""Renaissance"" and even ""Near the Beginning"" albums so stellar is missing here. The studio version of ""Break Song"" which is a ferocious highlight of ""Near the Beginning"" pales in comparison. The rest of the album has its moments but is spotty at best. I'm a huge Fudge fan and even I found it hard to listen to end-to-end. Buy it used if you can."
4,The soulful sound has been traded in for more hard guitars,"This is undoubtably the heaviest of all albums cranked out by this group. It's acutually good for a swan song album for a group. It kicks off with a tough number called ""Need Love"" which makes me think of ZZ-Top listening to this to get the melody for ""Tush"". ""Lord In The Country"" is a good timey song, but it's got some edge to it, ""I Can't Make It Alone"" is as soulful as it gets, and also ""If You Got To Make A Fool Of Somebody"". The covers are still therewith ""The Windmills Of Your Mind"" a show tune from where I don't know, and they have the unissued ""Break Song"" as it's done in the studio, and have shaved 3 and half minutes off the live version on ""Near The Beginning"". This unfortunately spelled the end for the Fudge as Carmine Appice would be the most visible of the four, and play with Black Sabbath, and Blue Murder, and Jeff Beck. They would reform in 1984 for the ""Mystery"" album and tour."
3,how she made me laugh and how she made it end,"I last listened to this in 1970. We wanted hard rock like Near the Beginning . The audience did not listen and walked. It may be musically good, in retro, but heavies migrated to Beck ,Bogert and Appice."
4,building greenhouses,"Very nice book, but needs more explanations on the design issues. Overall, I am happy with this book."
3,Covers most of the basics but leaves a lot of questions,"The DVD gives you the gist of how to make a counter top, but doesn't teach you how to install it or how to conceal seams that the cast in place leaves. Also, half the video is Fu-Tung pushing his products rather than teaching what the DVD advertises: building counter tops. I feel let down by the DVD because I did some counter tops withou any training and expected this DVD to answer some of my questions, but it turned out to be a uninformative sales pitch. This is a more scathing review than the DVD deserves. For someone with no clue what they're doing this is a good jumping off point."
3,I Feel Like I Bought a Infomercial,"This DVD is not a stand alone product, it gives you a good high level overview of the basics. What really bothered me was that Mr. Cheng constantly pitched his new products throughout the DVD. The DVD did help and make the process clearer then reading the book alone."
2,It's ok...,He definitely just pushes his own stuff.Home depot has a decorative concrete book from sunset.... maybe u can get it from Amazon too. Totally recommend that.
2,"poor quality, not worth the cost or shipping",don't waste your time putting photos into this album. The pages started to pull out before I completed it.
4,Photo Album,"They are just the right size for my vacation trip. I thought the pages would be larger and have more room for writing, but they are adequate."
2,Horrible Translation,"I'm not in agreement with the first reviewer about the use of language. If it's about gangsters, yeah. They're going to curse. But, I think that part of the problem here is that the translation from the original French is atrocious. It was like somebody lifted verbatim Google translations, which are so literal, that it takes the life out of it. I recommend learning French and reading the original instead. It's much better. Unfortunately, Amazon USA doesn't carry the French version, so you'll have to pay cross-Atlantic shipping charges when you buy it from Amazon.fr."
1,Uech . . .,"Just could NOT get into it. It was trying to be all philisophical and show the life of crooks and revenge, but it was the swearing that turned me off. I mean, come on, who needs five swearwords every two pages ranging from D*mn to f* and worse? Totally unecessary. I realize the author was trying to keep the criminals ""in character"", but it was just disturbing instead with a plot that wasn't seeming to go anywhere for my trouble after twenty-five pages of sheer, boring torture.I should have known better than to buy this, but it was on sale for five bucks so I figured I didn't really have anything to lose. I like buying things on a whim every once in a while because sometimes it turns out really good and I like discovering new authors. Unfortunately, I think I'll probably be avoiding him from now on. It will be gathering dust in my closet until I figure out if I want to go to the trouble of selling it or just chuck it in the trash can."
5,Great FUN!,What fun this movie was--am I the only one who noticed the warrior is an extremely handsome young man. The quirky movie characters and the setting was great fun. Watched on pay-per-view but may have to purchase so I can watch it often.
5,Cool Visuals,"I love this movie because of the visual effects. The Blu-Ray version makes it worth buying. The ensemble of actors make this worth watching, the story is bittersweet and the fight scenes are so cool. If you like stylized Japanese samurai/ninja movies, you will like this movie."
5,"""Great Graphic Martial Art Movies""","This was my FIRST time watching this movies ""The Warrior's Way'. Great movies, Great graphic, and Very nice Martial Arts moves. Me & my Husband enjoy watching this movie and will continue on watching this movie over and over again. I like ""The Warrior's Way"" movies because it has GREAT graphic and good story, and guess what!?! Captain Barboosa (Geoffrey Rush) is in it. He is not pirate in this movies but he is a Drunken Sharp Shooter in this movies I say! I don't care what other peoples think about this movie, but I like it alot! If you enjoy Great graphic and Awesome Action Martial Arts s h i t! Then get it yourself, watch the movie yourself, and enjoy the movie YOURSELF! You Savvy!"
4,It actually works!,"This movie is bloody and violent. It is not suitable for little kids. Nevertheless, the movie is fun to watch and the special effects can be downright comical at times. It is strange to have Asian warriors in the wild west but the movie actually works. Great job."
3,Ahhh what !!!,A weak story - too much of character built-up alot of loop holes. But what an action. Only good part about this movie is the brutal action sequences which are awesome.
5,Redemption in style,"A super fun, stylized action movie that moves at a nice pace. An East meets West movie that is different from all the others I've seen. Everything is packed into this film, action, romance, revenge, and a bit of a moral story. Grab some popcorn and enjoy."
1,Horrible,"This movie is very ""slow"" and very long. I did not enjoy the movie and I'm usually into these types of movies!! Very disappointed"
3,Very conflicted with this one.,"It was kinda lame until the last 30 minutes when it finally picked up. Too many looney toon characters to start with. And as cute as Kate Bosworth really is, they made her character seem like a retarded tomboy, so either she wasn't right for the part that made it seem that bad or the direction for her character was done poorly."
2,Eh!,"Maybe I am just jaded because I watch a ton of Asian Cinema. And tho I can greatly appreciate the combining of cowboys and ninjas, the cinematography/choreography were mediocre, and the character development and story development were very weak to me. I didn't really care much about the characters and the love interest chemistry seemed really blasé.I like these types of movies and would enjoy seeing more of them.However I found Good, Bad, the Weird to be a much better Korean Western than this, tho this was much more fantasy than the other, and the other lacked Ninjas and American Cowboys.The movie did have some redeeming gimmicks as well. I liked the comic book style intro of ""the greatest swordsmen in history"", however they should have used that more. For example, they could have introduced Geoffrey Rush this way once it reached a certain point in the film, etc.This movie had potential but it just lacked the emotion that I find in other films of this caliber."
5,Awesome Movie,"I saw this in the cinema and am anxious to buy it. People say it is a ninjas-versus-cowboys thing, but it's way more than that. In this movie, a warrior refuses to kill the final member of a rival clan -- a baby. He flees with the baby girl to a western town, where he was planning to leave her with a trusted friend. The friend, however, has died and the town is a struggling settlement with a number of out-of-work circus performers trying to get by. Among the people in the town are Lynn (Bosworth) and Ron (Rush), two people who each have a tragic history. The ninjas, searching for the warrior, happen into town at the same time as cowboys, who are searching for somebody else. Then, the battle begins to save the baby. The R-rating is well-deserved because of extreme violence and bloody scenes. Geoffrey Rush is an awesome actor who is not capable of making a lousy movie. He was great here. This was one of the best action movies I have ever seen!"
4,Off the wall....but entertaining,"Very unique and interesting - this film relies heavily on setting and cinematography...and the fight scenes are freakin sweet! East meets West with a very gritty, pulp-fiction-y feel. Colors are muted at times and very colorful and contrasting at other times. Asian man and baby escape to the American West only to find change in a run down carnival town where conformity are necessary for survival - with plenty of hero action in between. And my, has Kate Bosworth grown up! Geoffrey Rush adds a one off touch as the town drunk with unique skills. Lots of explosions and slow-mo sequences help make this one go by pretty quickly. Definitely a good Friday night movie, but have an open mind....it's not typical Hollywood - which is just fine."
3,Remember CD set was mostly good but had a defective disk,"It was mostly very good but had a defective disk with a very broken up song and when I asked for replacement, I could only get a refund."
1,Wrong part in the box,"When I went to install these rotors after I had the first one installed and went to do the other side I found that, though the part number on both boxes were the same, the second box did not contain the same rotor. Both boxes appeared to have the factory seal so this appeared to be the fault of quality control. Because of this I returned all of the parts I ordered for this job and went with Genuine OEM parts. It cost more but the fit was of course perfect and the quality of the parts appeared to be far superior.As a side not I ordered these from Amazon and they refunded my money and sent a return label promptly. I am very happy with Amazon's service.HTH,Robert Loose"
1,Junk,Junk. Didn't even work and has to be the cheapest piece of equipment I've ever seen that cost me $30 dollars. The company (Battery Heads) did have good customer service and was more than willing to replace/refund. That was the only good thing.
2,Useful By Acadameia Only,"If you are looking for a book to assist you in working with OSPF and building a network then do not turn here. The author spends 80 pages telling the reader how he did this and he did that to get OSPF to where it is today. I don't think he knows the word ""team"". The authors arrogance and me me attitude in this section was a real turn off. The book provides some useful information but nothing of great value to the network engineer that can't found in the RFC for free. His ""war stories"" and real world examples are so out of touch that it is a shame. It is obvious the authors experience is in the glass palaces of development and acadamia not in the trenches doing. In conclusion you can get the same information from the RFC and its free nor do you have to listen how he made OSPF what it is today. Buy at your own risk."
2,Dry Dry Dry,"I suppose from the purely technical perspective, this is a useful book; but Moy's style is among the driest and most monotonous I've encountered. I'm generally fascinated by networking and routing theory, but this book was so boring I had trouble finishing it. I'd also far too laden with irrelevant 'ancient history' about the early development of the protocol. I'd say, skip it unless you're a glutton for tedium. The information he presents on OSPF can be gathered more easily and more entertainingly from other sources..."
5,Awesome reference,Great book and great reference to OSPF and its many aspects. I have had this book for years and will not part with it.
4,Good Introduction to Intradomain routing,"If you are a technical guy with interest in understandingwhat happens behind the scene of your IP network this is a good book. The only drawback is that in some point you have the feeling things are non fully explained (details left to the reader); it's possible Jhon Moy had some interest in selling the second detailed book on OSPF (The complete implementation .."").Nice to compare what Moy says about OSPF vs. IS-IS with Perlman idea."
3,Ruined by...,Great product in that it does what it's supposed to do and looks great with one exception... the damn sticker residue. Why in the hell would a company sell a $100 carafe and put those stickers all over it. I have soaked this carafe overnight for days and there is still residue that won't come off. And this is the SECOND one that has done this. Idiots.
5,Good carafe,"This is a really pretty carafe. It also keeps my coffee hot for a long time. I kept poking a thermometer in it the first time I used it. Without preheating it with hot water, after an hour, it was down to 170F, after 4 hours it was down to 140F with it full. The next morning, it was down to 100F but that was almost 24 hours later. I'm sure it would perform better with pre-heating and if I hadn't opened it to get the temps. Under normal use, it keeps my coffee piping hot for the 4 or so hours I usually drink it.It has a nice self sealing insulated top but I can feel heat around the top while it is cool on the body outside. It is a gravity seal so it won't stay sealed if the carafe is tipped over.I got tired of my Oxo carafes not keeping the coffee hot so decided to spend the money to get a good carafe. I'm not disappointed."
1,flimsy tab broke,"This looks great but after about six months of careful use, a tiny piece broke off the tab and can't be fixed. It's WAY too expensive for that! And it's hard to operate manually without using an instrument to pry open the closed cap (the seal is quite good, which is great when the tab works). I'll contact Amazon and the manufacturer to see if they'll replace it, but am not hopeful; if they do, I'll update this review. Buyer beware!"
3,Nice but a design flaw keeps it from working better,"I like this carafe and use it daily. It looks good in the kitchen. It is built well using quality materials. The body is well insulated double-walled construction. However the top part where the handle attaches is not well insulated from the inner wall of the container. As such it conducts heat out of the container, like a heat sink. To compensate for this I put boiling water in there for a few minutes before use until the handle becomes warm.When you pour the coffee, it travels over the non-insulated spout which cools it down some.It keeps coffee hot-ish for the few hours I need it to work. Generally satisfied but I accept that I'm sacrificing some practicality for looks."
5,VERY HAPPY!,"I purchased this carafe because my last one broke. I was attracted to the sleek design and I didn't want plastic. It looks good on my table and because of its tapered design it has a small footprint. I'm a morning (4:30-5:00AM) person so I make the coffee. I also tend to be a bit OCD on the quality of my coffee so this was an important purchase! I followed the instructions and used hot water to preheat the carafe while my coffee is brewing. The coffee is still slightly warm when I empty and clean the carafe before going to bed. I like the way the coffee pours out and does not spill or slosh all over. It also feels good in my hand and is easy to maneuver. At first I wasn't sure about the lid, because it flips all the way back and seemed a little flimsy. But now I like it because it's easier to clean."
5,very handy little braket!,"I use these very often. I like to over clock my system and need lots of airflow in my computer case. these things fit the bill nicely. I tend to always put an aftermarket CPU cooler on right away and usually lose airflow across my motherboard that is needed to keep the motherboard components cool. This thing bolts just about anywhere and fits nicely on the PCI card slots and can usually blow air around the area of the CPU to keeps things cool. I usually put on a latger fan and slide it over tha memory as much as possible to help keep them cool. I just wish this bracket came without a fan as I like the 120mm fans for extra airflow and have several of these 93mm fans lying around. But if you need a bracket, you'll be hard pressed to find a better one. plus it looks pretty with it being already chome."
5,music lover from sunny so-cal,"This album is a MUST HAVE for any music lover, especially one of the Boo Radleys or Creation records. this is by far their best work since Giant Steps and maybe ever. The more you listen to it the more it grows on you. Good mix of synth and psychadelic guitar riffs blend nicely together."
3,Not the best way to call it a day,"For a band with such a creatively rewarding career(especially the golden trilogy that preceded this album-Giant Steps,Wake Up,C'mon kids)Kingsize can be viewed as nothing else than a colossal disappointment,a major drying out of the fire they once undoubtely posessed.While C'mon Kids had been a sprawling and colourful canvas of diamonds and quirky shifts in direction the boredom that haunts Kingsize borders on intolerable,or even annoying at times(particularly ""Free Huey"").Evidently,for a band so accustomed to the craft of memorable pop songs some are found here but in an appalingly short quantity-the only standouts being""The old newstand at Hamilton Square"",""Monument for a dead century"",""Jimmy Webb is God"",""She's Everywhere"" and thwe awesome ""High as Monkeys"".I would recommend this album only to hardcore fans since it could give newcomers a completely different idea of what the Boo Radleys are all about but then again the choice is yours."
5,Good glossy paper,"I have only printed on this paper twice so far, but both were good quality prints. I do not have a ""holder"" for the roll so I pre-cut the paper to the size I need and have no issues. I will definately buy again."
2,WANT TO JOIN THE FAN CLUB?,"I've been trying to figure John Andrisani out. My first look was THINK LIKE TIGER and now THE SHORT GAME MAGIC OF TIGER WOODS... Well I think I have finally pegged Mr. Andrisani: He's the unofficial president of the Tiger Woods fan club. Like THINK LIKE TIGER, SHORT GAME MAGIC is far too much about Andrisani's regard for his hero and nothing special when it comes to the subject: improving your short game.Sure, the fundamentals are there but presented in the same way as of a variety of similar books by other golfers. The thing that you have to remember about Tiger is that his short game becomes moot because his long game makes it all possible. Whereas a pitch shot of any of us earth-bound mortals is 70 yards and in, For Tiger a pitch shot may be as long as 150 yards. HELLO!Want a great book about the short game? Go with GETTING UP AND DOWN, the short game masterpiece by the undisputed king of the short game Tom Watson.THE HORSEMAN"
3,messy,"too many correspondences (topics), some of which so similar they hardly needed two entries.plus, the information is not too well presented. it just looks so messy! if amazon let you ever see anything other than table of contents (i.e. if you could see just one page of it) you would know what i mean!i haven't used it yet, and i don't see that i will. i am THAT much put off by the way information is presented :(("
2,Very Disappointing Disk,"While it undoubtedly is genuine medieval music, it doesn't sound like what you might expect. It reminds me more of something you would hear in an Arab marketplace or bazzar. Alternating notes played on a recorder until it drives you crazy. Many of the songs are rather similar (i.e. bad) and in my opinion it's a big disappointment. I had hoped for something to play at our medieval feasts and SCA re-enactments, but this doesn't make the grade at all."
1,DON'T BUY THIS GREENHOUSE,"THIS GREENHOUSE IS POORLY CONSTRUCTED,THE PLASTIC IS FLIMSEY, AND THE UNIT COMES IN 300 PIECES. THE CONSTRUCTION TIME WAS HOURS OF SORTING THROUGH TINY LITTLE PIECES, JOINTS ARE POORLY DESIGNED ON THE ROOF,I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY CAN SAY THIS THING WILL SUPPORT A SNOW LOAD. IT LOOKS LIKE A TOY. PRICED HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS MORE THAN IT'S WORTH."
4,Great product just be careful with the application.,I purchased this and applied it to my brown leather jacket. It definitely seemed to restore the leather as it's much more supple now however you should exercise great care when applying it. It states on the package that it will darken and can affect the color of your leather item perhaps I just should have heeded it more. On one area of my jacket I got a little heavy handed with the sno seal and now it's almost black it darkened it so much as well as it appears glossy. Overall I'm very happy with the product but next time I'll be more careful and take my time when applying it.
5,Great Sealer,"I use this on my custom-hand made reenactment leather boots. It has definitely helped keep the leather clean & shiny, as well as water-proof. I'd recommend this for anyone looking for a good leather preservative. It's amazing."
2,Breathtaking disappointment,"Where to begin. First let me establish my bona fides. I have all the Honor Harrington books in HARDBACK. My copy of In Death Ground is so worn I had to buy a new copy, I`ve reread it at least 20 times. I have every book David Weber has published with Baen and loved them all. That said it is hard to describe just how disappointed I was as I read The Shiva Option. The utter predictability verging on inevitability, of the plot line was stunning. At no point was the outcome in doubt or the heros in any real danger. Did I mention the plodding cookie cutter battles. Every one was a duplicate of the first. They could have saved alot of time and just written ditto Home Hive 1 thur 5. The reconquest of Telik was a fragment of a sliver of a foot note. The Star Union an half forgotten after thought. I could go on but why. Weber and White are too damn good to be churning out this tripe. I could have written better myself."
2,nothing original here--well almost,"the monsters here are a race of giant spiders (called bugs)--who cannot communicate with other races and are hard wired to conquer any that they encounter--then they use the conquered remnant populations of the planets they conquer as a food source--breeding them on ""ranches"". They have no art, aesthetics or emotions. I find the entire concept to be patently ridiculous.It's thinly disguised political commentary, manipulated by braindead libertarians--creating a universe that is black and white--how convenient for the this political mindset. The lefties in this universe have to be dissuaded from empathizing with these monsters. It's so outrageous!The most interesting passages of this book are printed in italics and seem to emanate from the governing intelligences of the bugs--cause otherwise the book is dull retelling of most wars--where the winning side has a substantial technological and manufacturing base advantage."
2,Less of everything would have been better,"I found the first 200 pages of The Shiva Option really interesting. After that it began to repeat ad nauseum. This is a great example of how less can be better. If The Shiva Option had been a lot less complex and about half the length it would have been much more enjoyable. Unfortunately, my interest in finishing the book will have to be added to the incredibly long casualty list."
1,No Suspense,"There is no suspense. Upon reading the first few chapters, you have read all the rest. I have enjoyed David Weber in the past, but this is definitely not up to his best work. In fact, this is well below any of his other books."
2,Quick buildup and slow finish,"The first 150 pages are very exciting, but the book leads inevitably to victory. At no point in the story did I feel that there was a risk that the Bugs would win the war. Why do the bugs feed on intelligent aliens? What is the motivation for their expansion? It is somewhat simplistic and not as satisfying as the beginning of the novel"
1,Paid By The Word,"Obviously, Weber and White were paid by the word to produce a 125 word (max)novella written in 674 pages of [language] so strong that I eneded up throwing the hardback copy across my den. Never have I gotten so tired of every new scene starting with a long, flashback that had no substance whatsoever, just excruciatingly boring filler..."
2,Tooo long,"I found this book to be greatly in need of a good editor. The good guys fight the Bugs, numbers of various classes of spaceships are enumerated, the fight is described in great detail, then afterward our heroes agonize about their personal relationships, strategy and tactics. This same general scenario is then repeated over and over and yet, over again. Some character development but this is overwhelmed by all the descriptive and enumerative detail about warships and weapons. Alien races are only sketched in a rather cartoonish way. The book needed to be much tighter, focused much more on character development, and in depth treatments of the aliens in the coalition against the Bugs and less on endless lists of combatant machinery."
4,Fitting Conclusion,"This book was a fitting conclusion to ""In Death Ground."" I especially enjoyed learning more about the Bugs. The book's failures are not due to story-telling but rather due to inevitability of the Alliance's victory. There was not as much suspense as in the previous book due to this fact.Something interesting to note: In ""Insurrection,"" a battlegroup of about 8 Monitors and 10 SDs is desrcibed as being bigger than any group to fight in a single battle in IW4 - which is the war being discussed in this book if I am not mistaken...of course, far larger fleets are involved in individual battles in this war...I wonder if the authors didn't read ""Insurrection"" prior to writing ""IDG"" and ""TSO""...I would appreciate a book concerning itself with the Orion - Human relationship (or any of the other allies actually).Worth buying? Of course...now if we can just get a book that takes place after ""Insurrection""..."
2,Ponderous and boring,"This book is very hard reading. It was as difficult and unplesant to read as getting a root canal. Weber goes into infinite detail about the numbers of ships in each battle and on and on and on.Part way through the book I realized that it was actually boring. Not much character development. Not even much of a storyline. Just battle after battle and numbers and numbers.I considered not finishing the book, but set it as a challenge for myself. I will finish this book. I did finish it. Now I'm ready to make an appointment for that root canal."
3,"Finally, an ending","If you love space combat, you love Weber. This book is a wrapup of the war against the bugs, and thankfully, the book has an ending. That sounds like something you would expect, but about halfway through, you may begin to wonder if the book will ever end.I get that Weber wants the reader to know that this war was a kill or be killed struggle. A war of extermination. Only one can survive. I just think he could have wrapped it up a little quicker, or if that weren't possible, he could have shifted the focus around a bit. Tell me a story about something that brought some more life to the story. As it was, there was a lot of hardship and pain, and then it ended. I felt it was a bit hollow on the storytelling and more like an account of trench warfare in space. If too much space combat were possible, this book would be the shining example.Still, Weber continues to be the master of the space opera. In this case, I think it went on too long."
2,Tedious sequel to In Death Ground,"I waited eagerly for The Shiva Option. When I got it, I actually went back and re-read In Death Ground first. I'm sorry to say the book turned out to be, dare I say it, monotonous. It's just bug battle after bug battle without the story and character development I've come to enjoy so much. Even the system maps in the front appear to be a careless afterthought. Between the undefined symbology and no cross references to the terms used in the story (try to find Anderson 3) it's a disappointment. This is the first (and please the last) David Weber book I actually had to plow through. Let's all hope the upcoming War of Honor is up to the usual Weber standards!"
2,Could have used more action instead of battle reports,"I know this book could have been half the size. It's too bad because I anticipated much more in terms of action. I would have liked to have read more about the fighters in battle. Like Starship Troopers, the bugs and their habitat could have more of a background story. Instead we get a lot of battle reports and behind the scenes detail that do not make for an exciting story. It was a letdown for me because I have read both authors work. The Honor series by Weber and the prequels for this series were far more involving. When reading a book of this size, the reader expects more in terms of adventure and action. I just wish the cover image matched the excitment in the book."
5,Page turner,Weber and White continue to thrill with the conclusion to the series. Just enough doubt is left for the reader to make conclusions interesting and less predictable. Well developed plots are rendered with sensitivity to realistic emotional and technical development.Worth reading.
1,Disappointed,"After the incredibly tense ""In death ground"" I waited for this book with great anticipation.The plot device used against the bugs is ridiculously simplistic and would have, in my opinion,prevented them from ever becoming the terrifying, nightmarish, force were in ""In death ground"".I really enjoyed ""In death ground"" , one of the few books I've read more than once, butunimaginative conclusion of ""The shiva option"" was a big let down for this reader."
4,Excellent ending....,"I've been a great fan of David Webers books many years now. The most famous ""Honor Harrington"" series is truly great to read.I found this book without actually looking for it. And by the look of it seemed interesting. So I got this one and the one before it (which is part one out of a two part series) which is called ""In death ground"". This book ends the story but you should really read the former one first to get all the needed backstory and a proper beginning.There is a lot of charachters. Some deeper compared to others. Also a great deal of space battles. Epic ones to be honest. The basic conflict is about two VERY different ways of life. Two extremly different kind of life: ours and our allies and the ""Arachnids"" who sees us as simpy food. This time EVERYTHING is on the line and loosing the war simply is NOT an option!"
3,Good not great,"Let me start of by saying I am a huge David Weber fan. I have read nearly all of his books from the Harrington series to the Dahak series and the rest of the novels in this series. The Shiva option is not as enjoyable as all of his other books I have read. The battles are repetitive. The warp junctions seem confusing even with the guides. There is a little innovation in the beginning, but them it seems to just repeat itself through the middle 300 pages. Good book NOT his usual great."
2,"Well, at least there's closure?","I'm a little disappointed in that it was not the hard hitting, in your face, extremely fluid reading ""In Death Ground"" was, I re-read the prequel prior to the sequel and I found the reading of the sequel, a little dull. The two stars is primarily for the character out of the first book whom I never expected to see, her story was well thought out and purposeful, unfortunetly it had gotten lost with everyone else's quest for purpose. Too many questions still linger and too many things were left hanging. Finally, are we to expect yet another novel with the Bugs in the far off future? This book would suggest, yes. Probably not worth the wait for all of us diehards, but I just had to know."
4,Good conclusion,"While I didn't like the first book in the series all that much this book provided a worthy conclusion to the first book. I also liked the fact that there was some charecter development in this installment. My favorite new addition has got to be that of a Glossary at the back of the book, this way if you are confused about a particular term you can go back and look it up. This solves my biggest problem with the first book"
5,What were those reviewers that didnt give it 5 stars thinkin,"this book was indeed the best Sci-Fi Military style that i have read to date... and i have read many.. Forever Peace (Bleh..), Forever War (YEAH!), War of Honor (YEAH!), In Death Ground (...YEAH!), Halo Fall of Reach (so so... basic beginner Sci-Fi Military), then there is The Shiva Option... a totally different category of its own... this book was [GREAT]! it completely blew me away with those space battles... if u thought In death Ground was good... ur going to get blown away by this sequel... I cant help but wonder... wat was wrong with those other reviewers... this book even has a glossary for all u people who have poor memories and complain bout how many missile and ship types there are... this book is the best though a little long... and though this type of story isnt original, it does put its type to the limits...!!!"
2,Disapoinment after a long wait,"After the multi-readings of ""In Death Ground"" and a huge collection of the authors' books, I was waiting with bated breath for the finish. I read the book in a rush, at least to the half way point, then asked myself, ""What is going on?? No new characters, no plot twists, nothing but a slogging to finish the story."" I'm disapointed, this sucker isn't worth a second read and I had a hard time finishing it. The writing was of the usual quality, but the plotting [was not what I expected]. No sequel please."
2,if only...,i heard ben jelen's work first on smallville - his single 'setting of the sun'. the song is gorgeous! and yet there is nothing on his album that comes close. i was so expecting such a great artist after that but alas. if only he could have more songs like 'setting of the sun'.
3,"Some good, some not so hot","When I first heard the song come on, I thought it was a great song with great lyrics. When I got the CD, though, I found that it was a lot more pop sound and synthesizers than I originally expected. I think that he would sound a lot better if he put on a CD what he did live: just voice and piano, maybe a couple other instruments. If you're really into pop music, then this is for you, but if you're expecting something somewhat emo-ish and raw, it will be a waste of money for you."
4,Ben Is wonderful,"Ben Jelen is a fantastic writer of music, his style is very pure and refreshing. His voice is very gentle and soothing, while still being powerful and emotional. This is a great cd. My personal favorites are Come on, Rocks, Give It All Away, and Slow Down. The only thing that is disappointing about this cd is the focus on love. Almost every song is talking about being in love or the loneliness of not having it, which gets tiring after a while. I would definitely reccommend Mr. Jelen's music to anyone in search of something exceptional."
2,"Ben Jelen ""Give It All Away""","""Come On"" 5/5""Rocks"" 3/5""She'll Hear You"" 3/5""Give It All Away"" 2/5""Every Step"" 3/5""Christine"" 3/5""Wicked Little Town"" 2/5""Falling Down"" 2/5""Stay"" 2/5""Criminal"" 2/5""Slow Down"" 1/5""Setting Of The Sun"" 1/5I was pretty excited when i heard Ben Jelen's first single ""Come On."" The piano player looked like someone i would normally enjoy listening to. I was, however, totally wrong. Aside from that first single, there are few bright spots on this album. Most of the songs drag on, and are pretty boring.Overall rating: Two stars"
3,might give this one away,"Ben Jelen's debut album 'Give It All Away' is definitely not as good as I expected. After hearing the amazing 'Come On', I was expecting so much from this guy. The piano driven 'Come On' is the best song on the album, vocally especially. If Ben wants to release another album, he better get some insight and inspiration and write some fantastic songs because this one is forgettable, uncreative and way too similar to artists of his genre."
2,One-hit wonder,"When I first heard Ben Jelen's song and saw his video, I was speechless... the artistry was amazing in both the video and the music... his image goes well with his music as he supports lots of good causes and in his cd jacket he even tells us to love the environment... however, the other songs on this cd.. besides maybe one.. are really primitively undeveloped. I only listen to Come On now... but I was happy to support Ben because I'm sure he's excellent live... I just happen to not be able to connect myself to any of his other songs at this point..."
2,CD doesn't delieve what he promises in concert,"Listening to this cd, you'd think Ben Jelen was your average moony pop star. If I had first heard him this way, I wouldn't have given him a second thought. Everything about this album, each song, the cover of the cd, all are clearly packaged to sell him as the next big pop star, around for a few weeks, never to be heard from again.In concert, he's clearly passionate about the music. Even with some subpar material, he clearly digs in, his vocals are good, and he plays piano and violin excellently. There is almost nothing noteworthy on the cd, and I clearly saw plenty to be interested in at his show. His excellent cover of Wicked Little Town is striped of emotion on the cd.If Ben Jelen is able to escape the claws of his record label, he might be able to release a much more interesting album. Until that point, keep your eyes on him, check out a show, and hope a live cd surfaces somewhere down the line."
2,Delightfully crappy,"Sounding like a young Dan Fogleberg (your mom knows who he is), Ben Jelen bears his soul for teenaged girls everywhere.Powerful (dare I say John Tesh-like?) piano notes drive Give It All Away from start to finish. With a voice capable of crooning like Jeff Buckley, it is a shame that Jelen chooses instead to reach out to the TRL crowd, belting out sappy ballads and cheesy, upbeat garbage.""Christine,"" with lyrics, ""just one moment with Christine, you know exactly what I mean"" sounds like an early 90's pop song reminiscent of Shawn Colvin's hit ""Sunny Came Home"" (read: trash that tries to sound important).""Christine"" is an example of Jelen's style. Trying to sound worthwhile, Give It All Away fails miserably."
3,Give it All Away by Ben Jelen,"For some reason this album received a lot of negative attention, but I intended to make the purchase anyway, and I'm glad I did. The record turned out to be everything I expected it to be. Jelen is infact a polished pianist & song-writer, and while there is nothing as instantly loveable as ""Come On"", its still a very good record by my standards. I have an undeniable weakness for ballads, and this album packs plenty of them, and good ones too, like ""Criminal"", ""She'll Hear You"" & ""Falling Down"". On the other hand, the up-beat tracks are pleasant also, such as ""Every Step"" & ""Rocks"". The album stumbles occasionally along the way, but given a chance to improve and live up to his potential, I can feel a respected hit-maker in the making."
5,Oh Christine...,"Christine is by far, the very best song on the entire cd! The entire cd ""Give it all Away,"" is a phenomenal work of art. I definitely recommend this to everyone!"
5,You can't go wrong with this one,"I must admit that I am not an avid Christian music fan but have had the pleasure of hearing Jennifer Knapp's music on the radio the past few years. She's got one of those voices that just draws you in - and keeps you. Whether you're a Christian music fan or not, the music on this CD rocks and it really is a true ""greatest hits"" collection unlike those many other artists put out. This is one of those CD's that you won't get tired listening to over and over and at the price of $10 that I paid, it's a steal! Grab it before the price goes up. You won't be disappointed."
3,Oh no !!!,"""Oh no, Jennifer came out of the closet! The sky must be falling !!! I'll never support her music again !!!!"" ... get a life. I'm hearing snippets of her music on Larry King and it sounds great. And I think ALL religion is bunk. Like Abe Lincoln said when asked why he didn't belong to any church - ""When I find one whose only tenet is The Golden Rule, I'll join."" Meanwhile, I look forward to getting this album."
3,Good.,"Not their best, but good. Vanilla Sludge? No. This is a decent Vanilla Fudge album, obviously highlighted by ""Shotgun"", and on the re-release, ""Good Good Lovin'"". Hey, where's that studio version of ""Break Song""? Maybe that one's on the re-release of ""Rock and Roll"", which I think is another good one. ""Near the Beginning"" is essential for anyone into classic rock and especially heavy rock of the era. The live ""Break Song"" could have been edited, but there some AMAZING passages in it, and it's not to be missed. I do think that ""Velvet"" and ""Happiness"" get lost in the shuffle due to their haziness, but the other 2 tunes on the original release more than make up for it. This actually was my 1st, and it inspired me to go out and get more. I like it. GREAT COVER ART / PHOTOS. They really capture the aura of the 60's and this album in particular."
4,"elephant graveyard, Huh?","In addition to DJRIX hilarious previous review, I'll add a few notes of insight. The 3 last cuts are addons. The solos in Break Song are tremendous especially of note Tim Bogert's bass. The Fudge live vs. studio led to too big a gap to cover in audience partipation. The next LP left everyone stunned or in shellshock."
4,Gentle but not getting the affects expected,I am not sure it is doing anything because I have gotten up to the 3 pills each a night and have been here for 4 days with only one elimination a day which is completely normal for me. I am debating going up to 4 each but I thought 3 was the most. I had better results when I drank the Super Dieter's Tea. The tea moved everything! I only had one cup in the evening. I don't think I would get this one again. Another cleanse I was on a year or two ago showed results in the second day. I have been on this cleanse for over a week and haven't seen the difference.
2,It's not living up to what all it says it would.,Am up to five pill a day it's my 3rd week. Some days am still constipated. And I only go once a day. I don't think if I increase my dose at 6 pills ea it would make a difference. I read everything it says it did and I felt good because I realized that if it did what it says it does it would have worked. Am going to finish it but I don't think I will use it again. If it has all that vegetarian ingredient I believe by now it should have been working wonderully.... always a catch to everything why can't something really work!
3,"Fair , informative","It's a good resource of ""edutainment"" forself-improvement, and quite creative as a career planner as well."
4,Plenty of information,I have the Audible version from Audible.com.Plenty of information that is read in a style that kept my attention. I learned about the key elements for a solid resume.Most people will probably find everything they need in this audio book.
5,"""Like a statue imitating some splendid ancestor...""","Amazing circles of stories - and a voice in stories I'd never heard anything like. I couldn't love all of the stories - but admired each one. ""Bridge of Music, River of Sand"" was among my favorites - it's pointing to nowhere but exploring everything a person might be thinking confronted with an inexplicable situation that no one else witness or might believe. The title of the collection alone drew me in and that first story ""Had I A Hundred Mouths"" that opens the book - the connection between a succession of stories never fully complete but strong enough to stand apart. I am now hunting up some of Goyen's novels that were in the author's list - ""House of Breath"" - to read more of his work."
1,Is this real?,"If anyone has common sence, they wouldnt perform ""Black Magik"" COME ON! Anything done returns to the person. So tell me, why do something harmful, if youre going to harm yourself too?"
3,"Decent, but updated","Possible purchasers of this should actually consider the Book of Ceremonial Magic, since it is a revised an enlarged version of this."
2,An OK Book,It was a well thought out book although it is rather hard to understnad clearly...not at all good information for beginners...
2,A poor attempt at exploring Black Magic,"Most of the book is Waite yammering about what he thinks about this and what he thinks about that. But if you look past his ego, you'll find a very well-rounded book that's really informative."
5,Great book on how to summon demons.,"This is probably one of the best books to read if your interested in making pacts with demons. This book is especially easy to read cus of its oversized pages and good print. Waits books are a bit of his own views, but he still knows what hes talking about. Overall this book will be one of your best guides to power, and even if your not looking to make pacts with evil spirits this book has a plethora of useful knowledge.Be warned though, this book is not for the idly curious. The instructions in this book WILL work if you follow them as its written. And you better be prepared, for the workings in this book will summon forces that cannot be contained without proper execution of the magic circles to protect you and contain the demons or evil spirits. And if they escape they will kill everyone in a 50' radius. but for the most part i found this to be a must read for all."
4,THE BOOK OF BLACK MAGIC,"EXCITING BOOK FOR THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN BLACK MAGIC. I DO RECOMMEND. I WILL SAY, IF YOU ARE LIKE ME, CURIOUS, PLEASE READ WITH AN OPEN MIND. NICE BOOK."
2,Would be great if it lasted longer than a day before tearing.,"Mine started tearing the day I put it on my steering wheel. Of the three rubber parts, one tore within 12 hours of me putting on my steering wheel and left padding hanging out. Another has half of the rubber bits coming off. The third is the only one intact."
3,Grips wear off easily...,"I purchased this along with some other Mossy Oak accessories for my husbands truck. The seat covers have held up pretty well. But this steering wheel cover is wearing out quick. The grip wears off easily, and the pattern fades. I'd rather purchase just a Mossy Oak steering wheel cover with no grip, just pattern."
1,Wheel Cover disappointment,The wheel cover lasted about a week before it was ripped and coming apart. I would not buy this product again.
3,Shining threads,"When Dagoberto Gilb stays on point, ain't nobody can touch him. Some of these essays are sheer genius. But too many of them are undisciplined rants. When he's self indulgent, it's embarrassing. He's so busy foaming on about being discriminated against for being Mexican, he lets the hard work of writing slide, and loses the reader's natural sympathy. He'd have a better case if he wrote it and didn't just type it half the time."
5,The best guide to bedside manner out there,"This book is outstanding. I was researching the literature in preparation for a communications seminar I wanted to host, and found that few authors write from a practical, clinical perspective. Platt does, and anything you find written by him is a cut above the rest, probably because he has done a lot of work with real physicians, and he has his own clinical practice. This book saved me a lot of time and improved my enjoyment of work. I am an emergency physician and needed something practical and effective. I never found anything even remotely as good as this."
4,"Quick, effective analysis of different patient scenerios","This is an effective, concise tool to help any medical student with virtually any patient encounter. It's easy to read, accurate and useful.Strengths: Brief, imaginative and educational on several levels.Weaknesses: Tends to pidgeon-hole patients, and approach them like problems, not people."
1,Glad Beattie got started - but this isn't worth the money...,"R. A. Beattie has produced a number of truely epic fly-fishing films. Really, really brilliant stuff filmed all over the world stalking every species I've ever dreamed of targeting.Unfortunately this initial effort is rough. He hadn't figured out the shots or music to use. If ""Off the Grid"" or ""Nervous Waters"" ever come out on Amazon Instant Play, get them! But don't get this one, it's just not worth the rental."
4,A clear overview of OO applied to enterprise business apps,"This book presents a clear and high-level overview of the issues and topics of client/server and OO computing. I've worked in the field for a while, so there was not much new material for me. Nevertheless, I still found it a useful read. It presents a coherent and comprehensive conceptual framework for thinking about the many of issues and tradeoffs in the field. The book's layout, format, and style make it readable and useful. It has a reasonable index, bibliography, and glossary. The beginning and ends of each chapter clearly summarize the material. The book's stated goal was to give the reader a fundamental understanding of essential issues rather than a barrage of incidental technical details. I believe it succeeded. I wish I had this book five years ago when I was new to the field of OO applied to business applications."
5,Jaw Dropping Guffaw Moments Abound!,"No Morals. No Ethics. No Problem! This show has had my mouth open and me looking at the screen like ""Did they really just say that?"" on more than one occasion. I have watched this show over and over and I am sure before its all said and done... over again. I own quite a bit of British Comedy and this is near the top. If you like Shameless (UK) or Nighty Night you will not be disappointed with this little gem. If on the other hand Hyacinth Bucket is more your taste then this may offend you. Lewd, Crude, and Alarming are all words I could use to describe it but don't take my word for it, buy it and see for yourself."
1,PULLING IS RUBBISH,"This series from England is total rubbish and I am sorry that I ordered the second season without having reviewed the first season. I am a British expat and love English comedy but comedy, this is not. No reflection on Amazon though as I did receive the DVDs in a very timely manner."
2,a Britcom that swerves between broad comedy and observent humor,"This Britcom stars co-creator Sharon Horgan as a bored bride-to-be who dumps her dull fiance in the first episode (just before the wedding) and then finds dating with her cynical friends isn't such fun. It has a certain deadpan appeal, but too often that's crossed up by broad comedy, like having her fiance crawl to her weeping on his knees. Low-key or exaggerated: choose, people! Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com."
1,junk,"This was complete Junk, I threw it away, the case didn't fit, the ear piece was terrible, and the charger i did keep but only as a spare since it was so cheaply made, I think this is the crappiest thing I have ever bought from Amazon, and if I were you I wouldn't want my name associated with it."
5,Great Sampling of inspirational and hymnal songs by a great country music singer and musician,"I had the opportunity for the first time to see Roy Clark perform in person in December, 2010, near his home town in Virginia. This man is not only a super musician and singer, but a great human being. At the concert, he was presented a top award for his work as a longtime Mason. This was not for just being a member for many years, but for the tiring and endless time he has given to the Masons. This hymnal CD shows his talent for inspirational and hymnal songs as he is a very talented individual in various types of music including Country, Bluegrass, Gospel and Comedy. Richard Bauguess"
5,Vae Victis,"History, more often than not, is written by the victors. Here we get a view of how the grand conquest of the Persian Empire by Alexander the Great might have looked to the vanquished side. The point of view is that of Memnon - Alexander's ablest adversary and an interesting figure in his own right - who, alas, gets short shrift in most tellings of the story.Scott Oden did an impressive amount of research, resulting in a convincing reconstruction of Memnon's long and chequered career. A real page-turner, a highly recommended specimen of a fine historical novel.One small quibble: a pity there was no action set in Egypt, I'd have loved to see Oden's take on that, perhaps least savoury, stage of Memnon's career. But never mind, the Macedonian scenes were an adequate compensation.So just go out and buy the book, you wouldn't be disappointed."
5,Loved It!,"I am a little surprised by the negative reviews. I thought this was top notch historical fiction, for all the reasons mentioned by others. Yes, it could have used a map, but Google does a good job of providing those :) I loved the story; I loved the characters; I loved the places it took me to in my head. What more can you ask for?"
2,Not as good as Oden's first,"Slow, poor character development, after his first novel-this was a disappointment."
4,needs a map,"Nice book, but it needs a map! Especially since some names are archaic and not found in a modern atlas."
3,So-So,"The book is entertaining and in my opinion well written. The story is clear and the heroes act and speak logically. Here is the rub. There is no mystery and suspense, everything is too predictable. The hero had been traveling and fighting in exotic places like Egypt that are only briefly mentioned. The end was boring. The hero's death was prosaic."
1,Terrible,"This tastes like scorched artificial butterscotch flavoring. If artificial sweeteners taste bitter to you, as they do to me, don't buy it. I'd read such positive things about Da Vinci syrups but this is my first and last bottle."
2,Disappointing...,"This book was okay, but I found it too full of examples from the authors' own relationship. To be honest, I don't care what you call eachother when you wake up in the morning...or how you decorated your first apartment. Don't get me wrong, the principles behind the stories are great, but the stories themselves became somewhat annoying. I would have like to see more objective advice."
1,!!!WARNING!!!....THIS FILM IS AWFUL!!,"LOW BUDGET,BAD ACTING,IF IT'S NEGATIVE,IT APPLIES TO THIS FILM......HA,FILM!THIS....THING DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE CALLED A FILM,THIS ...THING SEEMS LIKE IT WAS MADE IN A RENTED SHACK IN MEXICO FOR ABOUT 8 MAYBE 9 PESOS LEAVE IT ON THE SHELF AT THE VIDEO STORE,THANK YOU."
5,Works Perfect!,Just built an HTPC and needed silence. The stock heatsink fan on my Asus MB was very noisy. Installed this in 10 minutes and silence has been achieved. Just remember you have to have the board out to remove the old clips from behind. The other thing to keep in mind is this sits pretty tall and will get in the way of your video card if the card is long and lined up with the PCI/Express slot. I installed a Sapphire Radeon 5570 and it was close!
3,Not so silent,The long narrow strips of aluminum are prone to vibration. I just blow at it and hear high pitch buzzing sound.
4,This one is a sleeper!,"After getting to know this symphony from the well-known recordings of Solti (overwhelming in its intensity), Tennstedt (maybe all-around the best version out there), Sinopoli (great, highly rated, but there is a sour organ note near the end that ruins the impact for me!), Gielen (true bargain, fine rendition), Davis (earth shattering finale) - I was truly surprised with how much I enjoyed this relatively unheralded recording. Also with a big, overwhelming, powerful finale, I recommend this highly."
3,If you work HARD you'll have results,"I don't normally like the lemon/lime taste BUT once you understand that anything involving supplements are not for taste but for proven results FIRST... you'll appreciate thinks like creacore. I have been on this product for about a month now and have gained almost 15 lbs and my strengths have increased on ALL workouts. I'm currently on a cycle for 3 months to do 3 sets of ONLY 5 reps which of course means heavy, I've increased my overall muscle tone/look.So, if you go HARD, keep your rests in between sets to 45 secs or so the results will come guaranteed. Most people who say this product didn't help at all are either delusional or have no work ethic when it comes to picking up iron point blank."
1,Waist of money,"This is by far the worst tasting supplement I've ever tasted. I cant even tell a difference in my performance and I was consistent with the dosage in the instructions. It fizzed and turned green when i put it in water which made me wonder What I had purchased. I am not picky with my supplements as long as they work, but this was almost an unbearable taste it made me gag just to taste it, on top of that it didn't show any increase in strength or size. This just another way to waist your hard earned $20"
5,This is a great tape! Very challenging.,"Feb. 24, 2009 - This tape has no cardio at all. If you want a good, challenging, weight training work out, then snag this tape up. You work upper and lower body and you can ""pyramid up"" and get an even harder workout. I have so many FIRM tapes in my collection that I'm making a commitment to rate them on Amazon so that others will know exactly what they are getting. When I'm done with this tape, I really feel that my upper and lower body have been through a great, challenging workout routine."
5,Mind-Blowing Music,"I can't say enough about this recording. If you are a Schnittke fan, and choral music is your thing, than look no further. The sounds, the resonance produced by this choir is astonishingly beautiful. BUY THIS CD!"
1,Mad!!!!,"I just ""purchased"" this. Today I got an email saying that my order was canceled because they were out of stock. Why does it not tell you when you try to buy it???? It still says you can buy it, even though it's out of stock."
4,Typical Dora,Entertaining for the little ones. Nothing too scary. Good for ages 3-6. Great intro to Spanish!
2,get rid of the previews,"i love the dvd; a quick movie my 3 year old can watch and a show i trust. but here we are, going through about 10 minutes of just stupid previews that i actually don't want her to see: my little pony, lazytown, pokemon, etc."
2,scratched wouldnt work,i resived this idea and it was scratched and wouldnt work i was very dispointed as my daugheter loves dora
2,"Good, Except for Some Lack of Realism with Possible Safety Consequences","In the video, the main characters get very close to a moving train. My four year old pointed out that it is dangerous to get close to trains and train tracks, both because trains come very fast and can hit you if you are already on the tracks and because there is a suction effect that can pull you in if you are not on the tracks, but too close. He remembers facts from his reading well, and wishes the directors of kids videos would do more research, then put more real, helpful information in their videos. He also says, ""Why aren't all the characters robots?"" : )"
2,RCA Lyra marginal,"You really can't use it for audio books as it has no bookmark and you have to start the book over each time you "" close "" the book.Some of the external SD disks don't work.Get another one that is more reliable and easier to program.It turns out to be an expensive fm radio."
1,Don't waste your money. Let the buyer beware.,I got this mp3 player yesterday and within 4 hours it was dead. It completely locked up after its first download. All functions ceased. The customer support is severely lacking. The RCA website is the most useless thing I have ever dealt with. Don't bother with e-mails because they won't be returned. I had to call a long-distance number to even get any tech assistance on this unit and the people were polite but seemed hardly surprised that I was having a problem. Their advice was to return the unit to the dealer because it was defective. I am returning it tomorrow for a REFUND. I'm willing to spend a little more money on ANOTHER brand.
5,Lasagna Server,I have been looking for a long time for the right utensil to serve my lasagna and enchiladas at my family dinners. I found it in this product. Not only is it just the right size it is a beautiful server. I love it!!
5,Perfect!,"Finally I can serve lasagna without two tools! Perfect size, nice finish, and good heavy tool. Guests appreciate that they don't have to learn a new skill (holding a plate and trying to use spatulas) to serve themselves!"
2,Review on Invisible advantage,"I was suprised at how small this book was. The only color pictures are on the front and back of the book. The book talks about different styles, and history. However there are actually very little of the working details that one would actually need if they were building a suit using this workbook. The books lists materials one would need to build a suit, which is great, but there are very little other details one would need.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this book to someone who is planning on building their own suit."
2,It's ok...,"When i first got it, i was expecting it to be like manual on how to build Ghillie suits for all purposes, instead it was a 1cm pamphlet on the history of BDUs and how well Ghillie suits look for hunting. It does not have step by step instructions or even a checklist on what to get for making a HUNTING Ghillie suit. I am a huge Airsofter and was looking at how to make a quick effective Ghillie out of live vegetation. I would never reccomend this book to anyone. don't waste your money."
4,Easter Eggs-1# Coconut Cream & 1/2# Butter Cream Eggs,"The service and quality were excellent, I can't find anything as good in the mid-west."
5,classy and comfortable,These shoes are as classy as they look in photo and are very comfortable to wear. Seem true to size.
5,Clark's clog,"Love them. I already had a black pair, so I was sure I wanted the red pair. Thanks for having them. Macy's wanted more $$ for the same shoe."
3,TOO BIG,"Would have been a great shoe but I ordered a half size up and it was huge.....Had to return, but as always great service from Amazon"
5,Very Underrated.,"The Adagio movement of this piece is simply beautiful music. The melody is so haunting and melancholy and beautiful that you can listen to it over and over and over and be brought to tears each time. It kind of reminds me of the adagio movement of Rachmoninoff's Symphony No. 2 in overall feel and mood. Why Fibich is not more popular, I do not understand. The first time I ever heard Fibich, I was driving home from work around 11:30 at night, and his piece Op. 42 ""At Twilight"" came on the local classical music station. About 6 minutes in, the section of the piece that is most 'famous' begins and I tell you I had to stop the car. It was sooo beautiful that I just sat there listening in tears. I waited to hear what it was and having never heard the name, I just didn't get it. I caught enough of the composer's name to at least figure that out. I ordered several Fibich CDs trying to find this piece, and that is how I happened upon Symphony No. 2. Buy and be moved..."
2,Skip the hardback version!,"Don't bother to spend extra money on the hardback version of this book. I did this because I wanted to be able to pass it on to some friends. The paper quality is comparable to a paperback romance book (no offense to you romance novel lovers). I am very disappointed in the quality.I haven't read it yet, but thought I could let everyone know about the paper, so buyers could know which one to choose."
4,good support for video,Having the book with the video fleshed things out nicely and provided more teaching points for the work that I do.
5,AWESOME,I JUST LOVE THE HARMONY OF THESE TWO....THE WHOLE CD IS A SOUND THAT YOU DON'T HEAR MUCH NOW...JUST GOOD MUSIC
2,Valance out of balance,We purchased 2 of these valances for our son's bedroom window. One was longer than the other one. So we had to make adjustments to line them up.
3,Not as great as Christmas Wishes,"I was so excited to purchase this DVD for my girls, ages 6 & 8, who loved Christmas Wishes. We sat down to watch it this evening and were a little disappointed. Most of the movie is great. However, there is a scene where Holly tries to hypnotize Carrie so she will no longer be scared of the dark. What bothered me is that the hypnotizing actually worked - even though it was for the wrong friend. Amy was hypnotized and is now afraid of the dark, while it did nothing for Carrie. I was just disappointed that a scene like that had to be in the movie at all. I certainly don't want my girls attempting anything like that. I am thankful that I watched it with my kids and was able to talk with them about how hypnotizing or trying to hypnotize people is not something they should be doing."
5,Very Satisified,"Again this product arrived as promised, brand-new, still shrink-wrapped. No skips, scratches etc. My 2 yr. old daughter watches the movie daily. Thank you"
4,Emotionally troubled characters find each other,"This book features two emotionally stunted characters looking to find meaning outside of their usual casual (and abundant) sexual encounters. I found the plot somewhat unbelievable in the way they kept just running into each other until they could no longer avoid a relationship, but it did keep my interest.In my opinion, Ronica's writing is a cut above most of the gay authors I've read, and I found her book to have an entertaining and erotic storyline."
3,Steamy,"This is the 1st book that I have read by Ronica Black. The two main characters are so similar in some of thier actions I found myself having to look back to see which one was speaking. However, I did enjoy the characters and the development. If there were a sequel to this I would read it just to see where the characters have gone. This is a good summer time (or wish it were summer) book."
4,Nice glasses!,"I really like the glasses in this set and have received several compliments on them! I use them often for brunches and often serve Italian sodas, mimosas, sangria and juice in these glasses. The pitcher would be much nicer if the seem was not so obvious and uneven. I read the other reviews and thought ""how bad could it be?"" It is pretty bad, but at this low price I'm okay with it."
3,What a disappointment,"I have to begin by saying that the set is really cute. I am unsure about the quality of the glass though. The pitcher cracked on the very first day, I accidentally tapped it and another glass pitcher I had and it just cracked. I must say that they did not hit very hard at all so that it why I wonder about the glass quality. I hope the glasses dont break."
4,Good pitcher,The price was fantastic on this. I've used it a couple of times (for sangria) and it works great. My only complaint is that the handle looks really cheap. It's somehow molded on separately from the rest of the pitcher and is definitely noticeable... but not that big of a deal for me.
3,Attractive & Sturdy But.....,This was well wrapped & protected but whoever inspected the pitcher didn't notice the 2 air bubbles on the side of it approx. 3 inches down from the rimand about 2 inches away from the top of the handle.They stick out & I am right handed so I'll see them every time I pour. Great :-(( The glasses are sturdyand a nice shape. I guess I'll just live with the flaws- It's a hassle to try to return something this big. I guess these are flawed sets that couldn't besold in a store?
2,Pitcher cracked from warm-water wash,Pitcher developed a large crack after being washed in warm water from the refrigerator. Can't be very high quality glass.
3,Not what I expected,"Hardware included are very tiny screws which is fine for something that doesn't weigh anything, but I had to go in search of long screws that would actually fit into the mounting holes and grab onto a stud. Will work fine for a small picture, but don't use this for anything substantial, better to go with a french cleat or get your own hardware."
5,great item,used these to mount my headboard. love that my headboard is flush to the wall. really easy to use! will be buying more since i can't seem to find them in any big box home improvement stores.
2,Dishmate vs. Planet,"We purchased a case of Planet Soap and Dishmate Grapefruit Soap. I purchased the Dishmate not because I was unhappy with Planet but because Amazon jacked up the price on Planet and it was cheaper to purchase in store so we tried Dishmate.Dishmate really lacks in its ability to reduce surface tension (which is what soaps do). Comparing it to Planet, it really lacks in any ability to clean anything at all. We can seriously dilute Planet and it still works really well where as Dishmate at full strength lacks in any ability to clean anything. It does smell great and we use it as a hand soap instead.I would suggest you buy a single bottle if you wish to try it out instead of investing in a case. I wouldn't recommend this product as a dishwashing soap because it doesn't do much. There are other all natural soaps that work much better."
1,Expensive because you use 10 times as much!,I wish I hadn't bought a whole case! How eco-friendly is it really if I have to use at least 10 times as much to do a sink load of dishes?
1,Horrible,Awful product. Barely makes bubbles. You have to use triple the amount to wash the same dish as you would a normal brand like Dawn or other leading liquids. If I could return it all I would in a heartbeat .
3,Grimes travels well.,"I was surprised to find that Grimes was willing to take her ensemble cast on the road and try her hand at mystery in America. Although Grimes is not always good at clearing up the loose ends that she begins, she is true to her characters. Her descriptions are vivid and accurate and her gang of do-gooders are delightfully consistent. Frankly I would be disappointed if some young lady didn't win the heart of confirmed bachelor Melrose Plant in each novel. Grimes entertains if only because her characters have a self-depracating sense of humour and a rollicking good time. I was thrilled on a trip to Baltimore, MD when I stumbled across the tavern ""The Horse You Came In On."" It was a piece of my world crossing Richard Jury's path."
3,"Not Great, But Occaisionally Very Funny","I would definitely agree with those reviewers who say that this is a much waker story than the others in Martha Grimes' wonderful Richard Jury series. However, there are some hysterically funny aspects to this novel,which transports Melrose Plant and company to Baltimore. Melrose, one of England's most sheltered men, learns about American football, street people, and homeless shelters in a series of incidents that are truly fun."
3,Not the Best...,"As a devoted Martha Grimes fan, I can find something to like about every one of her books - with this one I relied on the tried and true characters of Jury, Plant, and Wiggins to pull me through the morass of plot twists, mediocre supporting characters, and the downright dismal portrayal of Baltimorians (can anyone possibly be that pathetic? I guess so.) One refreshing twist in this one - Richard Jury is nearly upbeat! It's often painful to follow him into the vat of depression that he absolutely must slog through in order to solve a case. Melrose is brilliant, as usual, and Wiggins is Wiggins. Gotta love him."
4,Character Counts,"Once again, Martha Grimes demonstrates the richness and diversity available only in character-driven novels such as this one. In fact, such is probably her major contribution to the modern murder mystery, a genre that has been excessively dominated by plot-driven tales. As is often the case in her novels, and is especially true of all involving Richard Drury and the other regulars (e.g., Wiggins and Plant), the plot resolution (who-dunnit and why) is the least significant and satisfying aspect of The Horse You Came in On. Rather, it is the unfolding and subtle interplay of characters that engages and enriches the reader. That being said, this novel will probably not be the correct cup of tea for those who seek only the puzzle and the solving of the crime."
1,Very disappointing--didn't make a BIT of sense.,"I am a definite mystery lover, but I have been disappointed in both of the Martha Grimes books I have read--she seems to ramble on and on and it all seems to be totally disjointed--as though she can't quite keep her mind on what she is doing. No more Martha Grimes books for me!"
2,"Style, not story holds this title together.","THE HORSE YOU CAME IN ON by Martha Grimes is my least favorite of her Jury/Plant novels. It appears to be a tale that doesn't know where to go and gives Melrose Plant the chore of carrying the narriative, who keeps giving away his clothes.Neither does the idea of Jury/Plant in America, it just doesn't work.Scip this one or read it last.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH."
1,Don't bother,"I'm so glad I checked everyone's reviews here before I struggled any further with this book, which I wasn't particularly enjoying. There does seem to be an awful lot of wasted ""talk"" and too much reference to previous works. I have enjoyed her other books in the past."
4,Enjoyed the prose,"This one is her 12th book about Richard Jury, an English police superintendent. That's why I picked it up -- love an English mystery. However, it is so much more than that. There are murders, detecting, excellent characterization, humor and great dialogue but even better are all the stories within this story. There is a novel being painfully torn from one characters' soul and we get to read not only parts of her novel, but also parts of someone else's who has tweeked it a bit but obviously plagerizing her prior novel.Someone discovers a long lost manuscript of E.A. Poe's (or is it?) And we get to read that too. There are verbal stories told, and dreams. I've never read such an abundace and variety of prose wrapped up in one little mystery!"
1,One of the worst books I ever read,"Like other reviewers, I read the reviews on the back of the book that said that this was a great book. They were so wrong. I made myself finish the book - assuming that there had to be some clever tie-up of all these stories. But there isn't one. The murders and the solution are merely minor storylines in this book. And all the rest is annoying characters and talk, talk, talk. There are about 3 chapters AFTER you find out who the murderer is (an obvious murderer) and they serve no purpose except for more talk, talk, talk. This was the first book I read by this author and I won't be rushing to read others."
1,Confusing and fragmented,"I've put this book down so many times in the last week in frustration. A book of this length usually only takes me a day or two to read, but this one makes so little sense that it's taken forever. The author jumps from thing to thing and place to place with little regard for her reader, who ends up lost and confused. I still have no idea who half the people in this book are or why they were in it, or how they relate to anyone else. The book is horribly hard to follow and therefore lost my interest far too often. I've not read anything else by this author, and using this book as a guide, I doubt I will in the future."
5,Lose 10 lbs of water!!!!!!,"I have purchased other Sauna Suits in the past but like the name ""Everlast"" this one is by far the best quality. Others have been poorly put together at the seams (underarm, crotch) that they rip and tear. This one takes a liking and keeps on ticking. I needed to make weight for a competition and was over my weight by 15 lbs. I began my cardio routine with the sauna suit for about 4 days and when I weighted in, I had lost 15 lbs. Use caution when using the suit though, it is very stressful for your body to lose that much weight in such a short period of time."
4,Great for sweating,"This product is good for what it promises. Lot's of sweat while you exercise. However, you will not lose weight if you are wearing the suit and eating twinkies while sitting on the sofa watching tv. You should also drink plenty of water if you are wearing the suit since you can become dehydrated pretty easily. It does not tear easily which is also a plus. It also runs a little on the big side. I am 5'7'' at 175 and the large / x-large was way too big."
3,Not to thrilled,"I won't lie this sauna suit did work really well. Only problem is that it ripped on me after three times of using it. I would suggest, you get a least a whole size bigger . Ripped from armpit area. Still get a nother one , just bigger size."
1,"Not only disapointed, much more than FURIOUS","I purchased this product first time. I have been purchased another type of Sauna Suite from Everlast, and I was satisfied those products. So this time, I tried to pay more for upgraded version of Sauna suite and did.It was not only disapointed, much more than FURIOS. I found torn after 2nd time usage. This time, I even recommeded to my friend to buy and she did. But same thing happened to her, she also found a few torn after several usage. And more worst story, I even purchased 2nd set for me. It is just wasting money and effort to purchase this worst goods. This is my worst shopping experience."
1,Everlast????,"I thought this suit would be durable. I just wore it for the FIRST TIME this morning and it ripped right in the crack of the back of my pants! A very cheaply made suit. I'll stick with the one I bought from Target for cheaper than this one. The one from Target has lasted me over a year and a half. I bought this one because it was black (as opposed to silver and blue) and it had the ''Everlast'' name so I figured I couldn't go wrong! I would never recommend this suit, it's a wast of money!"
2,RUNS SMALL,"Everlast Deluxe EVA Sauna Suit (Large/X-Large, Blue) SIZE RUNS SMALL. MINE RIPPED IN THE CROTCH AREA A WEEK AFTER PURCHASE. OTHERWOISE OK.DONT SEE ANYWHERE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WARRENTY."
2,poor quality product,"Purchased the EvA Suana Suit x-large/xx-large two days ago through Amazon and it split down the back. I just was laying around with it, never tried the light exercise. I am a womens size 18 and this was big enough, just made very poorley."
3,Just Ok,"Its very bulky. The plastic is quite uncomfortable but I believe all of the sauna suits are. Yet, this plastic is thicker than other sauna suits and I just can't keep it on as long as the other ones. I will go back to my old sauna suit that has much softer plastic. Overall it does the job. The amount of water dripping from your limbs is insane when you put this on and get on the elliptical. The plastic is just too uncomfortable and too stiff to wear everytime I get on my elliptical.It didn't rip and the fit was ok. I can't imagine this plastic ripping unless the person is like doing acrobats...or they purchased the wrong size."
4,"Does what is supposed to do, seems durable","I have been using this now for 4 months. No issues, or tears. I dont use the bottoms much, but I do use the top everyday.I recommend wearing a spandex shirt to avoid skin irritating."
2,Get what u pay for!!!,I was on day three of my workout and the pants split while laying on my back doing crunches
2,Bad Quality,"I was only able to wear this suit a couple of times,due to it ripping. The first time I wore it the rubber band came out of one of the legs. Maybe I just received one of bad quality."
2,"Cheap suit, wouldnt buy again.",Suit is very small. I normal wear xl shirts and a 36x32 pant. Pants ripped the second time i wore them. It would be just as good to wear a garbage bag
3,"Good price, but fragile","The material is very thin, and can easily tear. I got a 'size larger' thanks to other reviews, Because it's kind of tricky putting on and off without tearing it, and I ONLY use it when i'm on my treadmill. It does work though in helping you sweat more, But be carefull with it, if you're going to buy it."
2,Not durable,"It is a good thing but its not durable. I wore the pants and went jugging and it broke and the shirt when taking it off the right arm began to break, but I'm gonna fix that with dugtape."
2,Everlast Deluxe EVA Sauna Suit,This suit is supposed to be nylon and it is like a plastic garbage bag. Very disappointed.
1,waste of money,"I ordered this product known it's a simple cheap one, but I never expected to be that bad, it shouldn't be called a suite at all, it's more like a plastic bag, it have elastic ring on the so called nick and sleeves, those parts are hard and sure they will leave marks on your neck, this is a very bad product that the neck of the suite torn off the first time I tried it, it's a waste of money, do yourself a faver and buy a more expensive desent vinyl suite."
1,torn,I used the product for the first time and the pants ripped in the middle so i would not advise anyone to purchase this product.
2,lacking,"after 2 workouts on an elipcal machine the pants ripped, cause they were too small. i order the x-large and it's still for skinny people. other brands are better."
3,"""24 "" card game","The card game was played by 33 people of both sexes ranging in ages from 6 to 45 in a 3 week period.It seems the younger the person was ,the less fun they had.I think this was due to the fact that they are under the recommended age listed for the game.As for the older players, most enjoyed it at first but lost interest after a while.It is one of those games that work great for long winter nights or family gatherings."
5,WOW!! ELECTROFUNK!,"ever since the first listen i was hooked on this album. a lot of the electronic stuff i usually don't like so much, but this album has so much funk going on it's amazing. non stop dance fest! no vocals (definitely a plus), and jams that always make you want to move. for the most part the songs flow out of one and into another so you barely notice individual tracks. there are a few exceptions on the album but not many. these guys start grooving, and finally kick it into gear with awesome peaks. i've probably listened to this album 100 times by now, but i'm still not even close to being done with it. CHECK IT OUT!!! these guys have awesome shows too, they last forever and have a ton of energy."
3,A decent jab into electronica fusion,"While this band does hold some solid grooves, I do not recognize anything groundbreaking. Particle doesn't make any fresh attempts at this recent, contemporary genre of Techno/Jam. While Particle may give you a fun night of dancing at a live performance, don't anticipate a carthartic experience by listening to this average recording."
4,A Great Sci-Fi Book With A Grisham Twist,Grisham meets Asimov in this Sci-Fi courtroom drama. A great success for Sawyer.
2,A little over done. Not very refreshing,"I must say I was very disappointed in this book. I can't understand why all those supposed expert reviewers raved about it. What started off as a decent plot idea, putting an alien on trial, devolved into a poorly written and horribly contrived alien invasion story. Too bad. I would have liked to see a little more research and accuracy concerning California law and also some better developed characters and story line. Sometimes authors tend to lose focus when they start to preach. As a Canadian, Mr. Sawyer probably shouldn't be so critical of someone else's legal system. At least without being a little better informed."
3,David Coliadis' report,This book was ok but I don't think it had enough action in it but the courtroom sequences were very detailed about the evidence they found and that was the only part I liked about the judicial part of the book.
4,Just discovered one of the best,"With this book, bought while waiting in an airport, expecting nothing, I discovered a man that at once became one of my favorite authors. Sawyer is so creative, se sensible, so well informed and so human, he brings SF at a level that I must admit, as a trekkie, even Star Trek never reached. The evasion is absolute, the likeliness is as real as can be. Logic and emotions meet peacefully."
2,Trashy - but cute and fun trashy,"Johnnie Cochran meets ET. A dime store novel that is fun and light, if not kind of dumb. If you can suspend belief and just take it for worth, you'll like it. If you want deep and real, go elsewhere. If you can believe that if aliens come to this planet the biggest problems we'll have is a murder trail and if Oprah or Barbra Walters will interview them, then go for it. I like Sawyer and I admit, I like this cheesy book.AND - HEY AMAZON - GET A HALF STAR ON THESE RATING. I really want to give this 2 1/2 stars."
1,Uninspiring/Unbelievable Tale with a Catchy Title,"I found ILLEGAL ALIEN(1997) to be unfinishable - mainly due to the fact that it is a contemporary SciFi story that was written ten years ago - so it simply doesn't hold up to time, and there are far too many anachronisms and idosynchrocies to wade thru... the straw that broke the camel's back for me was the part where F-14 fighters are escorting the Alien Craft - it is impossible for me to ""suspend disbelief"" in this case, as the last F-14 was decommissioned this year..., and since no aliens have shown up yet, this situation couldn't have ever happened, and never will happen.After encountering a similar fiasco (but for different reasons - way too liberal politics and science) with MINDSCAN (2005), I'm definately steering away from any more books by Robert J. Sawyer."
5,Excellent Science Fiction!,"This just happens to be the first Sawyer book I read; and I can say without a doubt it will not be the last. _Illegal Alien_ moves along at a tightly written pace that keeps you turning the pages and guessing where the plot will turn next. I'm not a crime or mystery reader per se, I tend to stick with straight SF; but I love a good mystery and this certainly was one. The utlimately satisfying ending left me smiling. I must admit I had a little trouble getting past some of the gruesome details portrayed, but I'm glad I stuck with it. Without giving anything away it all makes sense in the end. Keep at it Mr. Sawyer, you can definitely write!"
3,Handbook of Aging,A very informative text about current and past research that relates to the ever-increasing geriatric population of the United States. One can take a look at factors that effect memory and cognition and other things that change as a person ages.
2,NOT the traditional flavor,"I enjoyed the classic-tasting split pea soup by Nile Spice, so was looking forward to their potato leek. Though I read the reviews and there was some mention of it being subpar (to put it nicely), I hoped that my tastebuds would find this good enough in times of laziness or hurry. I'm adventurous and quite the opposite of picky when it comes to foods so I thought, ""how bad could this really be?"" Well, I'll just say this: If you're looking forward to this tasting like the traditional style creamy colored potato leek soup, look elsewhere.I debated whether to give this ONE star because I know I won't ever get this again, but in all fairness, it IS edible... And if I hadn't been looking forward to this tasting even remotely like the Eating Right brand's potato leek soup cup, I might have given this three stars. Then again, this also had a slightly stale or processy taste, unlike other soup cups. Maybe this was a bad batch? Who knows."
4,"I like this, but don't love it","Like the corn version, which I prefer over this, the dry ingredients don't seem to mix with the hot water very well. Once it's done, though, it's quite tasty. A bit blander than the corn, so I usually add some black pepper to it. A nice option to keep around since it's quick to make and doesn't need refrigeration."
4,Comfort Food,"This is one of my favorite comfort foods. At about 100 calories, it is relatively guilt free. But think twice if you need to restrict your sodium."
1,Awful,"Maybe I just got a bad batch or something, but I have to agree with the previous comment that it smelled and tasted just like you'd expect warm vomit to smell and taste.It was not only one of the worst Nile spice foods I've ever had, it is probably one of the worst tasting things I've ever eaten."
1,Smells like warm vomit,I bought this flavor for the first time and tossed it.Once I added water and smelled it I almost vomited. The smell of this soup is just like warm vomit.
2,Too much sodium!,"The flavors in this soup are overpowered by the outrageously high sodium content. This is not a meal; by far it is not a meal. This is a snack, and a snack need not pack 24% of your daily sodium intake."
2,Spicy!,"Well, its in the brand name, but they do mean it. This is spicy. NOt the creamy leek and potato soup you're used to. Has pieces of carrot and tomato. Some would like it. But not those wanting a real leak and potato."
1,YUCKY!,"Don't waste your money. This stuff has the texture of fine sand and the taste to match. Yes, I made it as per directions. I was only going to put ""YUCKY"" in this review but people need to know to avoid this ""food"" (which is a stretch for the imagination)."
3,Emergency toilet paper ... When small rolls will do.,"Go to WalMart ... Target ... Half the price, same product.Are they useful for emergencies? For storage in the car in case a kid has a sudden emergency? Oh yes !!!But don't be fooled into paying three dollars per roll ... While even WalMart has jumped their price from last year's 1.88 for a three pack to 4.58, it is still more reasonable then what these vendors are asking.PS ... Six individual rolls will pack snugly into one of those waterproof boxes --> ""Outdoor Products, waterproof box, small (6.42"" x 5.1"" x 3.28"") ... And there is just a little room left over for some of those single hand washing towelettes in their individual cases ... Perfect combo for emergency car supplies."
4,Readable and enjoyable account of naval history .,"Wimmel's ""Great White Fleet"" reveals a little-known facet of Theodore Roosevelt's unmatched influence on American history. Well researched, this account of the USA struggle to become a viable sea power is a surprising history lesson.Not surprising is Kenneth Wimmel's ability to present facts in a refreshing, clear, but always interesting manner. This book will not disappoint those who have enjoyed ""The Alluring Target"", Mr. Wimmel's first book."
5,A very funny book in this special mystery series,"I have enjoyed reading all of the other books in this series and this one, Midlife Can Be Murder is another great read.Midlife Can Be Murder: A Bel Barrett Mystery"
2,Okay,"This seat cover is cute, and it will get the job done. However, it has a hard time staying in place, so you'll have to readjust it every time you get in the car! The elastic that holds the cover to the seat also wore out pretty fast...I haven't even had it for a year! But it's fairly functional. I would say a full seat cover is better, if it will fit your seat."
4,Go get it,"This was surprisingly goood. Excellent twist in the tale, great camera work, score anddirecting. It's rare that low(ish)budget horror flicks are this good."
4,Great little horror film,"Donner Pass is a great little horror film with a nice amount of reverence for the genre. While not as gonzo as his films can be, I would liken it to a Rob Zombie film where you can sense the excitement and love for the genre in tiny details. The film has a little bit of everything, and although I wouldn't usually consider that a good thing, here it's done so well that it comes together nicely. It starts with a historical perspective of the setting's notorious past. It then jumps to present day and slowly, smartly builds tension subtly revealing more and more things that just aren't right. It then busts wide open delivering a lot of gruesome gore and also delivers a nod to the rape/revenge sub-genre. The end, I don't want to give away but it delivers a smart, unique explanation of what has transpired. Highly recommended."
3,Donner Pass Movie by KO,"This was a good movie-nothing overly exciting, but kept my interest. Quality of picture was vey good. I do enjoy the options and selections."
5,good qulity,Good quality 3M SandBlaster 9682 4.5-Inch Angle Grinder Multi-Grit Surface Conditioning Disc it working perfect with my angle grinder I have no problem
4,Excellent introduction to the field,"Keiser provides an excellent introduction to the field for those enetering the optical communications arena. He progresses from the fundamental bases for electromagnetic propagation in dielectric waveguides to specific practices and principles related to implementation of optical fiber in communications systems. Although the treatment of some commonplace modulation techniques in current practice is a bit light, this volume definitely helps to get one's feet wet in the discipline. Highly recommended for students, as well as those just entering the professional arena."
3,Product Overview Only,"The book provides a good overview of features and changes from earlier Windows versions, but has very little practical information. It would be useful as a single source for new features if you are already familiar with Windows 2000 features and Active Directory. One area where it does go into some practical advice and detail is in installation and upgrade. The biggest disappointment is that most, if not all, of the information in the book is readily available from the Microsoft Web site."
1,A 400 page brochure,"This book is really a waste of time for anybody. It's a 400 plus page brochure on the new improved features of Windows Server. It doesn't explain how to do anything, simply introduces the new features. For someone familiar with Windows 2000, I would imagine they wouldn't want to sit there flipping through the 400 pages just to go ""WOW"", and for someone like myself, an absolute newbie to server technology, without any practical background on the subject, it all meant nothing to me. OK, Active directory now dooblats roaming profiles (?) eh? Yes, you get a 360 day copy of Windows 2003 to play with but it doesn't tell you how to play with it!I find no redeeming features about this book. I should have read reviews before buying it. I mean, why buy advertising? I gave it 1 star so as to be able to post this review, as it doesn't allow zero."
4,Un Live enregistré en France !,"Premier Live du groupe ! Il aura fallu attendre longtemps depuis leur première tournée en 1980...L'album est excellent et le son parfait. On retrouve l'ambiance de cette fantastique tournée ""Mindfields"".Best : Caught in The balance, A million miles Away, Better World , Mama, White Sister.Plus d'info sur : www.totofrance.com"
3,Half a Story,"The lack of information on Sefaradim in Arab Lands is deplorable. The author perhaps lacks knowledge of these languages to adequately research the matter. His assesment of these people seems to be limited to those today in Israel. What about those that went to Canada,the US, France, Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina?"
5,Diet for a New America,"This book changed my life in 1993. I was young and impressionable then, yet it still all makes total and complete sense today (unlike most things from my youth). John Robbins was set to be the heir to the Baskin Robbins throne but then walked away from all of it after learning about the industry. He makes good arguments all throughout this book and ties them to facts and logic, not emotion. I highly recommend it!"
4,meet your meat,"i've already known most of what i read in this book, but it's still a good read. hopefully convert you to being veggie. if not- maybe you'll eat less meat anyways"
5,Diet for a new America,"Great book, actually the second time i've bought it and read it.A great eye opener."
5,"Outstanding, compassionate classic.","I read this book for the first time seven yearsago, and it literally changed my life.Virtually overnight I stopped eating animals,and quit fish shortly thereafter.Robbins takes us on a shocking tour through the meat industry, and through excellent research, persuades the reader that our modern diet is killing us AND the planet.A modern classic!"
5,A revolution in thought,"John Robbins did a wonderful job. This book is a revealing, and convincing look into something we intentionally don't give much thought to.I was recommended this book [indirectly] from Russ Rankin, he referred to it as the book that changed his life. It is easy to see why. After reading this book you will no longer look at things the same way. It is a revolution of thought and perspective and a book we all owe it to ourselves to read.I could critique details or go into what it's about, but I think it would cheapen the flow and arguement of the book itself. Regardless of who you are now, or who you are when you finish the book. You'll be better off that you read it.Don't read nitpicky reviews, this is not a waste of time...I assure you."
4,Turned me into a Vegan,"What can I say about this book...it really encouraged me to completely change my lifestyle. The animal stories were a bit sappy, but that was the point. The statistics jarred me enough to change my diet that same day. As an on and off vegetarian since high school, this book has finally made me decide to choose a side."
3,Good information,"This book was informative, but the information on animal abuses may drive people away from reading the all-important information about what our All-American Diet is doing to our health and our future. It is worth reading, as part of general search for information, along with books like ""The China Study""."
1,The sloppy ignorance of this book is uncanny.,"This book, if one could call it that, lacks words of it's own and chooses to use the words of others to make it's point, most of those people being dead. It makes harsh rationalizations, ignorant to the opposite side that it should be trying to convince. This book has actually increased my meat consumption. Do not trust anyone that hands you this piece of veal."
3,a decent classic,"I'm into the health food movement like a lot of people nowdays. Unfortunately most books and programs don't cover all of the many ways to get and stay healthy. Although the above book listed is an excellent resource. It's like most authors and programs are trying to be too pc (politically correct). To correct myself a little, most health advice, programs, books and supplements usually offer pretty good advice these days.You know:1. Don't alcohol2. Don't abuse drugs3. Don't smoke (cigaretts and the like)4. Eat move live fresh fruits and vegetables.5. Eat less process foods and meats.Now all of this is good advice, although there is a right way and wrong way to do anything. I saw an excellent book with a good 8 step plan. Search Amazon for: The Magic Of Mother Nature's Healing Foods. I liked it."
2,Caution! -- Very Biased presentation,"Although I've been a vegetarian nearly all my life, and read Robbin's book when it first came out, I must warn potential readers that it is highly slanted and biased, having chosen or ignored evidence that fits which his thesis, to present what is really a somewhat dishonest book of half-truths. For example: he'll never mention that primitive meat-eating tribes around the world, or archeological evidence of past tribes, reveals that they never had cavities, teeth problems, or osteoporosis, - but when tribes changed to a farming culture, they suddenly began to the same teeth and bone problems that we can today. (Or that I, a long-time vegetarian, have. I'm now in the process of introducing more dairy, and perhaps meats, into my diet.) for a starting page in getting another viewpoint, go to the WestonAPrice site. Weston A. Price is one of the foremost writers on this."
1,Too one sided,"There is a growing number of animals raised holistically and humanely on grass in this country (that never see a bit of grain.) Naturally raised meat is the best source of protein around and is designed for our systems. And GRAZING animals are better for the environment than plowed up crop land. The author should have delved into this aspect more, as he apparently doesn't appreciate the huge groundswelling of humanely raised meat animals. However, this book is obviously a 'feel good' for the vegetarians out there. I wish he'd expose how much of the fruits, vegetables and grains are grown in this country. One would be horrified as to how many farmers basically sterilize the land for their crops. I suggest looking at the site Eatwild.com. I care about what I eat, that's why I eat only pasture raised, grass fed meats such as our bison. All those Indians couldn't have been wrong....Try reading ""Traditional Foods are your best Medicine"" by R. Schmid"
4,A must read,"Old, but not really outdated, this book will make you think about what you put in your mouth.Although it may not convince you to go vegan, it will inform you of the personal and environmental consequences of choosing to consume heedlessly. It will encourage mindful eating. It might also gross you out a bit.I think some of the language is a bit inflammatory for my tastes, but I happen to agree with much of it, so I was almost able to overlook it. Read it for yourself and judge."
5,"This is a one-of-a-kind, life-changing experience.","The Diet for a New America has sort of become the Bible of the vegan movement, and with good reason: with a reasonable, dispassionate tone (at least as far as the subject matter will allow) and extensive, well-sourced references on health and agriculture, the book makes a powerful and attractive case for giving up animal products. What makes this book so powerful is its ability to reach those in the mainstream, like me, who don't wish to be radical, to create awareness, and to make veganism an attractive object -- which it really should be. I've read a dozen books on the subject, but this one is the life-changer."
3,Credibility,John Robbins exaggerates. He takes a most unusual situation and makes it appear to be the usual. John Robbins is not a credible writer in my opinion.
1,Hard to get through,This book was highly recommended by people from my biology class... said it changed their view on things. i couldn't get past page 3. the writing style is so obviously biased and unorganized that someone who may agree with mr. robbin's point of view might be turned off. i dont know. maybe this is not a fair review. i really just couldn't get past page 3. i really did try my best but it was much too tedious.
3,Good knowledge of nutrition. Bad knowledge of economics.,"This is the book that enouraged me to become a vegetarian when I read it in 1991. John Robbins certainly has a good knowledge of health and nutrition. Unfortunately, he does not understand basic principles of economics. For example, Robbins thinks that if farmers in the United States grow extra grain and then feed it to cattle, then that somehow causes people in Africa to starve. According to this thoery, if I build a house that is bigger than what I need, then that will cause somebody in Africa to become homeless. What nonsense. To anybody who is interested in learning about hunger, the environment, overpopulation, and the scarcity of resources, I reccommend that you read THE ULTIMATE RESOURCE 2 by Julian Simon."
5,The Vegetarian Bible!!,"In so many words, this is by far one of the best books any person who is concerned about their health and the impact of their food choices on the world can read. I consider it my vegetarian Bible. I have used it as a reference for many research papers and have gotten excellent grades. This is a must read to learn about animal treatment, farming, health, vegetarianism, and more. This book could scare you and is a real reality shock!"
3,Good book...,This was a pretty good book... makes me think of the old maxim: The general and the captain are giving opposing orders again and I just got seriously wounded... I would highly reccomend this book to all who are intereseted in milatry history and the life of a soldier... great book especially in today's day and age.Chris
3,Warning,"Just two words: this is an anecdotical book about insider originated attacks, not a technical book discussing prevention and detection techniques and tools. I was mislead by the title when bought the book. Try instead the book EXTRUSION DETECTION if interested in prevent, detect, and fight insider traitors/attackers in enterprises, data centers, intranets or extranets."
3,Not the Best Pairings for Good Adams Works,"From purely the standpoint of length, the two works by David Lang dominate slightly over the two works by John Adams. To me this is unfortunate, as I found the Lang works extremely difficult to understand and downright unpleasant.The Adams works are excellent, but there are better places to find them. ""Short Ride on a Fast Machine"" is available on three other CD's, and ""Grand Pianola Music"" is available by the London Sinfonietta, coupled with Adams' ""Chamber Symphony"". Pursue the Adams there and avoid the Lang."
5,Ome more for the collection!,Great product! Great dealer! Great Satisfaction! This little toy is part of my sons car collection and he is happy with typical English cab that just joined it!!!
2,Ew.,"I'd rather smell this stuff than cat poop, but that's not really saying much. Super sickly sweet smell that you can taste on the back of your tongue. Gave it away to my 14-year-old niece who loves it."
3,Verdict is Still Out,"Although this was supposed to fit my car ('85 Olds Cutlass Supreme Brougham 307) Modifications had to be done. Also since other issues have arisen that weren't made clear when this product was recommended, so can't say it is performing its best."
1,Awful,"First, it came packed horribly and I almost declined accepting the shipment because the box was so beat up. Product came in a sealed box inside that packing box, but when opened, the heater had no less than a dozen dents and dings on it. It didn't look refurbished, it looked used. I sent it back immediately. The one positive, Amazon's return policy was easy and UPS picked up the package right away."
4,"Came in very good condition, great deal!","Came in a big Amazon box, original manufactural package found inside with a reconditioned sticker on it. The heater is like new, only with some scratches on the top. Ane it reall works well, can quickly heat up on full power mode, which make me feel very happy, although it is still too early to test it in the winter. Worth the money!"
3,Work for it purpose,"It hada some dents when I received and top slighty came off its slots. After a little work, I was able to put it back together. It is working OK since then."
2,One Good one & One BAD one!,"I bought a new one and a refurbished one, TWICE. The first one was great. The refurbished one had cosmetic damage and would not work. The box it came in obviously had been reused several times. I sent it back to Amazon and reordered another heater. When the second one arrived it was VERY obvious that Amazon had just sent the damaged heater back to me, with different paperwork...in the SAME damaged box. Even UPS said not to accept it and gave me some paperwork stating that it was packaged terribly and had damage. I should have listened. After opening it, I could tell it was the SAME broken heater....it didn't work! SHAME on you Amazon!! I will NOT uy this model, refurbished (NOT)again. The new model worked and is still working great though."
1,A total failure and complete waste of time,"What a complete failure and total waste of time. I was sucked in by the low price ($50), thinking that with Amazon I'd still get a quality product even if the item was reconditioned. The Amazon box that arrived on my doorstep was barely held together by a limited amount of packaging tape. The unit had obviously been jostled heavily during shipment. The heater had two small dents on the body and obvious wear on the top, which I think occurred prior to shipment. The heater's power-indicator light didn't blink 'on' when the unit was plugged in, and the 'start' button all but fell off when I tried to start the unit. I can't believe this unit passed any type of quality-control check at the manufacturer, as you'd expect from a reconditioned product. The only thing that worked were the caster wheels. Hopefully the return process won't prove itself to be a second nightmare."
1,Unit didn't even turn on when it arrived,"Amazon is taking the return, which is the good news. The bad news is that in spite of the bad reviews some have given here, I was optimistic in believing that usually only the motivated and disatisfied write most reviews.For what it's worth, my recommendation is that you shop for a different unit. The quality control at DeLonghi doesn't seem all that great. Every computer I've ever purchased has been factory refurbished, and most stereo equipment too. In short, I'm not someone shy of chancing it w/ refurbished/reconditioned electronics. Unfortunately, this is the first time I've been disappointed.Thanks to Amazon for having such a great return policy (by the way, the unit comes w/ a big sticker that says ""Factory Reconditioned: no returns"". So, perhaps DeLonghi unloads these things and legitimate distributors get played for suckers.)"
1,A VERY BAD EXPERIENCE,"I ordered this as a birthday gift for my daughter. It arrived dented, no instructions, no wheels or mounting hardware. Without the wheels, the heater has nothing to stand on, so it's pretty much useless. This was in a sealed DeLonghi box, so it's not amazon's fault. Still a very disappointing purchase."
2,REGRET,"Purchased two of these reconditioned heaters for the price of 1 new shipped. One was missing pieces to assemble the wheels and constantly cycles between heating settings, the other has a clear display that keeps falling out and they both have dents and scratches that make them a very regreatable purchase. Spend the extra cake and get a new one - great heater(new)."
4,Great value but definitely has limitations,"I'm generally happy with the reconditioned Dragon. My factory-reconditioned unit was clean and well packed, but the LCD did have a big scratch on it -- so don't expect it to be new-item clean.This thing puts out an enormous amount of heat, even at the lower settings. It definitely gets hot to the touch, so if you have kids or pets be careful. One major thing to keep in mind with all radiator heaters is that they take time to work; I usually turn mine on and come back to the big room it's in an hour later. But if you want quick heat, you might be better off with a fan heater.This unit does have a digital timer, but as other reviewers have noted it only turns on for a maximum of 4 hours at a time on that setting.One last note -- it heats a room much more efficiently if you put it under a drafty window or in front of a fan. Otherwise, the heat just goes up and doesn't circulate nearly as effectively."
3,DAMAGED ITEM,"ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW THE CONDITION OF THE RECONDITIONED DELONGHI OIL FILLED RADIATOR HEATER UPON SHIPMENT, I RECEIVED TWO DIFFERENT SHIPMENTS VIA UPS AND THEY WERE BOTH DAMAGED. THE FIRST DAMAGE OCCURED WHEN THE UPS DRIVER DROPPED THE BOX FROM THE TRUCK ONTO THE GROUND AND DAMAGED AND BENT THE HEATER. AMAZON SHIPPER AGREED TO SEND A REPLACEMENT AND WHEN IT ARRIVED, IT WAS COMPLETELY BROKEN INTO SECTIONS. SHIPPING CARTON WAS BADLY MANGLED AND WAS DUE TO ROUGH AND CARELESS HANDLING OF THE UPS SHIPPING EMPLOYEES. NO WAY WOULD SOMEBODY SEND OUT A RECONDITIONED ITEM THAT WAS IN THAT BAD OF A CONDITION. I REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE PACKAGE AND UPS RETURNED IT TO THE SHIPPER. I FINALLY ASKED THEM FOR A PARTIAL REFUND OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE FIRST HEATER INSTEAD OF HAVING THEM SEND ANOTHER REPLACEMENT. WAS GIVEN A $20.00 REFUND AND I AGREED TO KEEP THE ORIGINAL ITEM SINCE IT WAS STILL USABLE."
2,Very Disappointed,Tried to use it in the garage on cold night (36*F). Could not put out enough heat to warm anyone unless standing next to it and holding your hands over the top of the heater. Even tried a low speed fan behind it and that didn't work.
5,Go Lisa!,Lisa has an awesome voice! I love her music. We also have the same manager :-) Love ya girl! Keep it up!
4,Used CD Transaction,They were great. Had a problem and they with no questions asked returned our money. Top rate company to deal with!
2,"Fine toy, Feels Cheap","This toy is fine, but all of the pieces are cheaply made. The larger viewing enclosure with a magnifier on the top and bottom is fun, and sturdier than the other items, but comes apart too easily -- frustrating for younger children. This is an adequate toy for one's own children, but due to the poor quality, I'd never give it as a gift. Once the novelty wears off (which didn't take long for my five year old), it's not much better than a magnifying glass and a jelly jar."
3,"Enlightening, entertaining, abbreviated","This is really 3 1/2 stars. The subject was engrossing, the story of the rivalry between the heroic Frenchman and the brilliant but cheating Japanese researchers interesting, the history of the plague informative. BUT it was very condensed; the chapters were quite short and needed fleshing out.I did like the organization - alternating between a breakout of the plague in modern India and the one that struck turn of the century Hong Kong. Particularly disturbing were the tales of modern plague and the rather easy conditions needed to engender such a horror.The author did not spend enough time with the main story. He concentrated on colonial conditions, the prejudice of the imperialists, the still-existing problem of health in the 3rd world. But the heart of the story was the rivalry between the two researchers and the plague itself. This could have been a brilliant book - instead it was only above average. Pictures and a bibliography are included."
1,Horrid. Does not deserve its reputation,"Let me say first, I am an amateur painter. But I have been painting interiors and exteriors for a long time. Let me say second, the day I used this was humid and warm. But it was not outrageously so. My prep was sound: spackel where I need it, sand and clean with Dirtex.I used a good roller cover. I painted as I always have. The result: A primer that came off in patches. Disappointed to say the least."
4,Solid Primer,"I recently painted my kitchen cabinets & used this to prime the bases so I wouldn't have to sand in the house. The cabinets were approximately 14 years old and had never been refinished. They were a medium brown color with a glossy finish. Overall, I was pleased with this primer. I wiped down the cabinets relatively thoroughly but without using any harsh cleaning products and then used a 1 inch brush to apply the primer. It had decent coverage & stuck to the glossy finish well. There have been a few places since that have scratched off because it came in contact with a sharp edge, but nothing that couldn't be patched. In hindsight, I would recommend two coats of primer or the use of a roller instead of a brush when working with glossy/slick surfaces."
2,"Great tasting but does not ""cook"" properly","This soup tastes great and the price is not bad. But the contents of the soup do not fully ""cook"" when prepared as instructed (I have the same issue with a different Nile Spice soup). Even after letting the soup sit tightly covered for 10 minutes, about a third of the beans and 2/3 of the rice are still mostly hard (watch your teeth). I won't be ordering any Nile Spice soups in the future."
4,Fast work meal,"Okay, so it is high in sodium, so if that is your concern beware. Black bean is still #1 with me, but this is good for variety. Protein and fiber are high, and you can't beat the Amazon price."
5,Great Soup--Great Flavor,"Hard to believe that soup in a cup would be tasty and healthy, but this one is both. I used to eat Nile Spice soups in DC where I bought them at my local store, but had a hard time finding them once Imoved to NYC. These are healthy, tasty and convenient. This flavor is SPICY, but very tasty."
2,I didn't like at all.,"Here is what I think about the taste, it's really bad. I did follow the instructions, it's not something you will enjoy eating specially if you like eating beans. Here is the problem making it the beans become really soft while the rice are still hard, and the soup takes on a weak style bean soup. I didn't like it at all."
5,"Excellent ""Instant"" Soup","I love broth based soup. In fact, I love soup of ANY kind. If I am trying to lose a few pounds, soup is one of the first things I stock up on.Nile Spice, Red Beans and Rice soup is low fat which is good in itself. It is a little spicy but not so much that someone who did not like spicy would not eat it. If you like Mexican food, you will probably like this soup. Also, it is ALL NATURAL....sun ripened tomatoes, rice and red beans. It comes in individual containers so it is good for work or school.There is a lot of beans and rice in the container. You need HOT water, not warm for it to ""cook"" properly. If you don't use hot water or if you don't let it ""sit"" long enough, the beans are hard.This soup is priced right, very inexpensive for 12 portions. I have not tried any of the other soups by this company but I highly recommend this one."
2,I didn't care for this one...,"I tried three of the Nile quick soup cups - corn, potato, and red beans & rice. This one was my least favorite. I absolutely disagree with reviewers who call it spicy. I don't get a hint of hot from it, but there is definitely an over-seasoned thing going on. The beans always seem to stay hard, even letting it sit for double the time, and the overall texture is sort of thick like a chili, but also kind of watery. I just don't care for this at all."
5,no more itching,"For the price , this brush will do the job and it seems so far to be of good quality."
2,"Decent educationally, but disappointing gameplay","I would have to agree with the other reviewer that this game isn't really ""up to par"" with The Learning Company's other games.The game does have some educational value (although even that could probably be a little better), but the game itself is poor. As the other reviewer said, you make few decisions and a lot of the rest is up to luck. A good portion of the game is simply watching. This makes for some boring gameplay."
4,Prison Book or Guide to Swearing?,"The book is a really good one, though it offers no proper plot to read about. What would grasp your attention would be the feelings and emotions clearly described and its astonishing ability to describe prison life like you've never known it. A must-read!"
2,Too long,The historical part of this book concerning past Olympic games is interesting but the story of several dysfunctional families is poorly written and much too long.I had to struggle to finish it and was very surprised at the number of favorable reviews it received.
2,"Disappointmentville: NASCAR Series, Book 2",2.5 out of 5 stars. Cute NASCAR story ... but the way Sarah handles the situation kinda upset me ... I mean the book is well written but it made me not like the book's ending too much.Reviewed By: From Me to You ... Book Reviews(read more of this review and a teaser on my blog)
3,What happened to the sex scenes?,"Former kindergarten teacher, who was recently fired from her job b/c her ex-BF falsified some pics of her as porn, got a job driving famous race-car driver's RV. Upon their accidental meeting, she was was misled by good-looking hero that he was just the poolboy b/c he liked that she didn't know about him nor was impressed by his money or status. Attraction was instant but heroine's fear of being hurt again obstructs their promising romance.The book was funny & romance good. Sexual chemistry was popping. And then the sex scenes...was glossed over!!! It's like being promised some yummy chocolate only to get celery instead. What a disappointment!Partially recommended for witty dialogue & ok romance without any loves scenes."
2,Boogity Boogity Boogity,"This novel is abosultely wonderfully written,I'm proud to be associated with it as a Fan. I heard about this novel from KPLX 99.5The Wolf Radio Station from Dallas by Tara. It held my attention all the way, I can't wait for the next 2. I hope the next 2 are as good. Thank you from a true diehard NASCAR fan. Its worth reading.I give it the NASCAR NEXTEL CUP CHAMPIONSHIP!!!"
4,"Entertaining, light reading","This book was very entertaining, ""grabbed you from the beginning and held you to the end"". An enjoyable, quick read."
2,Didn't quite work for me,"This book is the story of 3 generations of women. The majority of the book is told from the first person of the youngest of the generations. The oldest generation is told from a diary. I found the story from the diary disconnected to the other stories, other than the fact that the women was the mother of the middle generation woman. The middle generation, who is elderly and suffering from Alzheimer's, has just one or two chapters from first person perspective, which I found uneven. Either don't bother to use first person for her perspective or give her equal treatment with the other two stories. The writing was fine and the story of the youngest generation woman was fine and times very good. But overall, did not blend well enough for me to recommend."
5,Good wire with less spatter,"I like the 2lbs size and the price of this welding wire. I've used Lincoln since I started welding several years ago. Took it out yesterday for its first test... Needed to build a new gate for our horses. I used rusty old well pipe that I had laying around. Cleaned it up a bit with a wire brush (my grinder just died) and had at it. There was less spatter with this wire than others, it penetrated well, and it laid very smooth. The only issue I had was occasional binding in the hose. Not sure why. I have never had that happen with Lincoln wire. The gate was finished, hung, and tested. Worked great, welds are strong and look pretty decent for flux on old pipe."
3,It's flux wire,"Just slightly less expensive than the wire that Wal-Mart started stocking near me. Works about as well as any other flux I've used, the spool likes to explode (unravel) when you first unpack it like a lot of others, so just keep that in mind and you should be fine."
4,Downliners Sect - 'The Country Sect' (Repertoire),"Band's second effort - seeing the light of day in 1965. Guess the British R&B group thought they'd try their hand at country rock / pop - understand this second outing of theirs is still decent rhythm and blues - simply different than their first and third lp's. Tracks that show you what this five piece is capable of are ""Rocks In My Bed"", the Buffalo Springfield-ish ""Above And Beyond"", the awesome ""Bad Storming Coming"", ""Lonely And Blue"" as well as the disc's two well written ballads - ""Little Play Soldiers"" and ""Waiting In Heaven"". This title comes with five extra cuts - nice."
3,Confidential?,"Not any more. Joyner's titles always hype up things but then that's who he is. All the books he authors, or co-authors have good information in them but the basics have never changed - this information has always been out there in various forms. Granted, you'd have to assemble it yourself. So Joyner just packages it for you and makes a lot of money. After all business is business and if you can plug into everything the way Joyner does, why not? My hat's off to the sly Mr.Joyner who knows how to milk it for all its worth."

5,3-ring photo albums,Thank you for a wonderful product I just love it.....and such an ellegant product
5,magical,A wonderfully illustrated and written hannukah Tale. Enthralled my granddaughter so much that I purchased more for nieces and nephews.A must in the children's library!
1,Not what I ordered...,The cap that was delivered didn't look anything like this. It was a stars and stripes pattern with glitter nothing like the photo. The material is thin and it has an elastic band. Would not have ordered it if the description fit the actual product that was shipped.
2,Welding cap not for us.,"The welding cap seemed to be made of good quality; however, it was way too big so we had to return it. And it sparkles! No reason for sparkles on a welding cap. That's just silly."
5,A Great Record,"Having already bough and loved the last OCMS record I was expecting to love this and was not disappointed. While this is bluegrass, old timey music it is also inexplicably modern. Loving bluegrass will no doubt help you love this album, but I also think it is good for anyone who like good lyrics and strong, different instrumental. If you usually like rock or even punk you'd probably like this album. A great album to add to your music collection."
3,"Simple, yet good...and a little disapointing","First of all, Big Iron Wolrd is a fun album to listen to.Now for the bad news...It's not up to par with their live show.That is pobably a problem for me since my first encounter with OCMS was at Bonnaroo 2007. It was a noon show and it was extremely energetic and fun, and the studio album does not capture the live energy on all tracks. However, this is the case with most studio albums, so the only reason I am partly disapointment is somewhat unfair. It is a fun album with some cool tracks. My Good Gal is a good song, so are Down Home Girl and Don't Ride That Horse. Generally it seems I like the slow songs more than the fast ones. For concllusion, I like the album, although their previous album might be better."
4,"Nice set, I wouldn't mind a slightly heavier dolly though",I'll preface this by noting that I've never done any sheet metal work before using this set. I've managed to work a fairly good-sized dent out of a fender on my project car. I would perhaps like a slightly heavier dolly as the last little bit of my first dent is proving to be rather difficult to pull. I used a combination of a slide hammer and this set and it seems to have worked out fairly well.
4,Decent set,"I've never used body-work tools before, so I have nothing to compare these to. This set seems to have the basics, and it worked for me on getting a dent out of my hood. I like the case, too. I made sure I read a few books about bodywork before I started banging away; it helps to know a little about the correct procedure of hammering metal."
3,Hobbiest grade.,"The machining on the faces of the hammers and dollies is not to bad. the handles are real lightweight and pretty cheap. An OK set for the home shop , but not something a pro would want to use ."
4,Very intriguing story,This story was an original one that held my attention throughout the read. The characters were well presented and the flow from plot to plot was smooth. I liked the way the story was pulled together in the end and the surprising twists. I'd even like to see a sequel to this story from the author.
4,Nice...,"Its a nice hoody, only downside is that the Blue color tends to fade VERY easily. So make sure you hang dry only."
4,Inner Facilitator work,"I reread this book every few years, when I'm confused about leadership, followership, group process, mysteries of human organization (which is all the time, right?!) There are parts I quibble with, and remain confused by, and I don't think I would ever have enough trust in the process to take the risks Mindel explains from his own group work. But so much of what he says rings true from my own experiences in groups, and I read on, and always get a deeper learning for myself as a facilitator-- or perhaps a better metaphor, surfer!!"
1,Stay Away From This One!,"This collection was an incredible disappointment. I gave it one star because the selection was interesting. Unfortunately the recording quality and the volume variability are abominable. Whoever mastered this has ears of corn.I was especially interested to get, and disappointed to not hear, Dooley Wilson's ""As Time Goes By,"" from Casablanca. The sounds are so fuzzy AND muffled, I could barely recognize them as music, let alone the song itself.The songs' volume levels also vary wildly and unnecessarily. One moment you turn up the volume to hear, the next you rip off the 'phones to prevent permanent hearing loss.In a word, this thing is lousy.There's so much lovely music in the world.Buy it, but not this."
3,good practical advice,Frank offers good practical advice here. This is not an incredible book by any means but more of a guidebook with examples of how to protect yourself. I think Frank a little short with the structure here and could have kept me drawn in a little bit better.
5,Our Precious Identity,Frank Abagnale gives us a great deal of insight into how our identies can be stolen even if we have never opened a charge account in our lives. My sister frequently tells me her identity will never be stolen because she never uses a charge card over the Internet. Mr. Abagnale blows that theory out of the water. We're living in a new world and need to take new precautions as clearly explained in this book.
3,Good Review but Nothing New,"Stealing Your Life: The Ultimate Identity Theft Prevention PlanIf you are absolutely new to idea of identity theft, it's a buy. If you've ever been a victim or are generally self-aware, it's a pass. Stealing Your Life is a good guide to preventing identity theft. Considering that a fresh victim is hit every four seconds, this book offers important tips and techniques from an unsurpassed authority on the latest identity theft schemes. Abagnale explains what criminals do and what steps you should take to protect yourself. Several anecdotes of creative criminality are included, which are as entertaining as they are enlightening. This book provides clear, practical ways to protect yourself from one of today's most common crimes - BUT none of the methods described are fool-proof, and what is worse, it is unlikely that you have not heard at least 80% of this information before."
3,6X Magnifier,quick and just what I wanted. And should not require 14 more words required.What?-View tips and guidelines | 5 more words required.
3,Just what you would expect,"Nothing special about this tool. It works well, it may need replacement once a year. But I think normal wear for a wire brush."
3,not good for barbecues,"Although the brush is both cost effective and sturdy, I didn't realize when I ordered it that the handle - aged wood - would be a fire hazard if used as I had intended to clean the grates on the barbecue."
5,It does exactly what it's supposed to,"The thing works way exactly as described. I think it could be modernized by having a larger screen and support for video, but overall I am happy with the performance of this player. My only complaint is the software that comes with it does not burn cd's very well."
2,Deceptive Marketing (No OGG),"This is a very nice player. The interface is slick and the speaker is very cool. The only major problems I have are a) the radio is useless without headphones plugged in (they act as an antenna) and b) despite Samsung's claim that the device supports OGG format, it does not. One cannot place ogg files on the device and play them. Only the bundled windows software plays OGG files. At best, this is grossly deceptive. At worst, it's a straight lie. This would be a 4 star review if not for the ogg problem."
4,Mig Welding just about anything,I use this to weld just about anything made out of steel.Works good and does the the job.This does what it is supposed to do.
2,Flimsy,These salad tongs are very flimsy. The handles are thin plastic and the tongs themselves are too flexible to pick up much of anything. I definitely feel that I paid too much for what they are.
1,Strange selection of low quality photos,"I had not high expectations on this CD andafter having scanned through the cacti it is clearthat this in NOT a CD to recommend to any seriouscollector of succulent plants.Most of the photos are out of focus (how is thispossible with the high-tech digital cameras of today!?),and TOO MANY plants are misidentified or are havinga cultivar name (not scientific name); what is Rebutiabolivia and Rebutia epizanaensis?The selection of species is very strange and it seemsthat the only purpose was to collect as many photos aspossible without considering the quality!You can get much better photos and information by searchingthe internet OR buying books like Preston-Mafhams Cacti, theillustrated dictionary"" and Sajevas ""Succulents, the illustrated dictionary"" (Part I and II)."
5,Excellent source for the amateur or semi professional,"I found this work to be useful and easy to navigate. As a collector of Cacti and Succulents, I try to learn as much as possible about the plants that I love. This work is a big help.It is obvious that the author loves his work, and his knowledge of the subject shines through in the organization of the material and the editorial comments.Most of the pictures are clear and many species also include a second or third picture detail of the flower or other interesting feature of the plant. Often times, there are several plants pictured.I can fully recommend this book to anyone interested in Cacti and Succulents, from beginner to professional."
4,This is a great flat iron,"I have had this flat iron for about a year. It is sturdy and I have not had any problems with it. It makes my hair silky and smooth. The only thing that I don't like about it is that the temp only goes to 360 degrees. Previously, I had a HAI convertable with the blue plates. Its temp would go to 400 degrees. It finally broke after I dropped it for about the 4th time (one of the plates came out). My hair is thick and course and the higher temp worked better. If you have thin or fine hair, you wont need the higher temp. This (turbo chi)iron is a little bulky to use but I have adjusted to it. If you have frizzy, fly away hair, a ceramic flat iron will make your hair soft, smooth, and silky. I don't know how I ever lived without one. I also have alot of gray hair and this product tames it well."
5,A truly touching tale of love,"Mina is a city-girl whose tragic loss of her husband has left her in a state of spiritual and emotional distress. She is led on a path back to God, love and happiness by her guardian angel Sam, who proves that miracles do happen in this day and age.This is a beautifully written story of loss, hope and God's love. At times I laughed out loud, at times I cried, but by the end of the book I felt as if I was a part of something really special. The characters are real, and endearing, and the story is intriguing. This is an excellent love story."
4,Hope remains the child of bitter experience,"""Singing Lessons"" - - a journey into Hell with a personality who might appear to epitomize success. Her battle to comprehend, her relentless search for serenity whilst dealing with her only son's suicide is an enriching literary experience akin to late night soul baring over endless cups of coffee: a catharsis for writer and reader with stream-of-consciouness qualities which resonate authenticity."
3,Its really heavy,Worth the price I paid (under ten dollars) very heavy and seems well made. Comes with bulbs. Too heavy to carry around a lot.
1,12 Premium Clothes Pins at a very Premium $9 Total Costs!,"It is hard to find nice plastic clothespins in the stores. So, I ordered Soft-Touch Premium Clothes Pins through Amazon, who used checkysdeals. Because the clothespins were included in a larger order from Amazon, I didn't realize that for 12 little clothespins, checkydeals charged $3.99 plus $4.99 shipping! $9 for 12 little clothespins which didn't weigh any more than a few ounces, and arrived in a small plastic mailing envelope. Well, they can fool me once, but they won't get a second chance!"
3,Start breaking after just one year,"I have owned these clothes pins for just over a year. I loved them until recently...I was hanging laundry as usual and one of the clothes pins broke. I thought it was a fluke and tossed it. However, the very next day I had 2 break and it hasn't stopped since then. I have had one to two break almost daily since. I live in California and while I keep them outside, they are not in direct sun all day. For a product that is made to be in the sun and claims ""that these do not get brittle and break like the dime store plastic pins"" I am disappointed. In my opinion they should last longer than just one year.I called the manufacturer and with little hassle they offered to send me a replacement. Unfortunately, they are only sending me a package of 12 which will only replace what has broken so far. I fear all will break soon and will have to be replaced. If my fear is realized, I will definitely be buying a different product."
5,Just the extra tracks alone are worth the perchase,"If you want to get a great sample of the Swervy sound and awesome rare tracks to boot grab this Double album. It covers thier whole catalog quite well even though its missing some real killer tracks, but as a sample it is a good mix overall. Read the other reviews here for the blow by blow, because they have done a bang up job of it there is no need for me to say what they have already. Swervedriver just Rocks in a way that no other band has before or after them so pick this up and enjoy."
3,An average attempt at the causality of fundamentalism.,"This book fails to impress the intellectual of a reader who has a prior introduction to Islam or it's twentieth century resurgance. Although it does trace out the roots of the present day Muslim attitudes to the Islamic theology that surfaced in the twentieth century, it fails to signify this relativity to any degree. Ideas are repeated with a monotonous frequency which diminshes their collective efficiency and understanding. Strictly written from the Sunni Muslim fundamentalist movement's prespective, it does little justice to other sects of Islam - at times even specifically branding Shia's as heretics."
2,"Nice Looking Bag, But Bad Quality...",I really liked this bag. It's got a really nice looking and great leather touch. Functional interior organized pockets and zipper pocket. But the interior fabric got riped off after only a couple weeks normal used. Too bad but it's almost useless now. :(
5,Beautiful Anger,"Great sound quality on this live set that serves as a ""Best Of"" by the wonderful Hersh!! Best purchase I've made here for months!"
3,Katy and the Katerpillar Kids,"-(Sequel to the film, ""Katy Caterpillar""--the adventure of Katy as a caterpillar before she has children)Katy and the Katerpillar Kids is a magical movie from the 80's. It is about a mother butterfly (Katy) who has two children Kiki and Koko. They are two little caterpillars who can hardly wait to fly. So, one night while their mother is asleep they decide to go and take flying lessons. Here their adventure begins with a bat who's intent is to cook the caterpillars, an ant colony with a Queen ant that has a scepter with a hand on it(the hand moves and looks like the Queen's hands), a silly singing hawk with a leather jacket and of course the aliens X,Y, and Z who need to move to another planet because their food source has run out. A great cartoon adventure with lessons to be learned that the entire family can enjoy."
5,Memories,I gave this a 5 even though I haven't seen this movie in 15 years. I was young and remember picking out this movie all the time at the white video store down the block. Amazing the stuff you remember and find on the internet. I had loved this movie and so had my sibs so it must of been awesome
4,Physical and Spiritually blessing,"This video was one of the answers to my search a yoga routine with a Christian perspective. I studied yoga before but my husband hadn't and he was very skeptical. But several of our tennis and ski buddies recommended daily yoga for health benefits. After playing this video once, husband was hooked and now sets up the mats in our exercise room each evening. Fr. Thomas' routines are well demonstrated and easy to learn but still challenging. The meditation isn't too 'in your face' if you are just interested in a workout. It's a calming way to end the day, even the dogs join us and stretch out in front of our mats! I suppose it would work fine for a day-starter, too, but our mornings are too hectic. I think beginners or more experienced users will find this a blessing physically and spiritually."
1,Do yourself a favor and stay away from this garbage,"This was literally the worse picture quality I have ever encountered in my entire life. Looking at myself on the screen was equivilent to wearing my mothers glasses whose vision nears 200/200. I couldn't even read the huge text on my shirt. The best part of the whole deal was returning it and getting something that resembled a camera. If you want a webcam and you are thinking about buying this one you may as well go stare at your reflection in the toilet bowl because that is about as functional as this camera. Do yourself a favor and stay far far away. Not to mention it felt like a giant eyeball was staring me down, kinda creepy really."
2,Great Product Poor Packaging,I was going to be wrapping this up giving this as a gift to my sister. Instead I bought something else for her since the packaging was so awful. The packaging was torn in places the plastic cover crunched and scratched so bad that you can barely see the product. It was perfectly wrapped in brown shipping paper so it must of been this way before shipment very disappointing. I will probably still give it to her but not as a christmas gift :(
1,HORRIBLE,This seller is horrible to deal with. I placed an order August 16 and never recieved it. I tried contacting the seller on 4 different occasions and never once got a response.
5,Blessed,"A wonderful, pray-full book on the life of a great Saint. Very insightful account of the convent life of the Saint. A must read for anyone who loves the saints."
5,This is an oldie that I have been looking for for years!!!,"This is a compilation of two albums: Songs of the West, and Songs of the Cowboy. My son was born in 1963 and I rocked him (sometimes us) to sleep with this music. His son and my (new) grandson will also now be rocked to sleep with the same music. Thank you Mr. Luboff for the greatest in relaxing music."
5,Cowboy Dreams,"For years it has been one of my great favorites. Please put it on CDso my record will not wear out!>>>Sincerely, Joan"
4,Nostalgia,I've used this cologne for over 20 years now because it's the one my father used. Not only do I love the scent but it is very different than most mainstream colognes now and people really notice it's gentle air. Very good product.
5,Use it daily...,"Love the Powdery Fresh Scent.... Last's through the day, as I work in an office setting so I""m not a ""sweater"" the Women I work with Love it ;-)"
2,Ehhhh....,"Not so impressed by this product. I bought it for a coworker of mine who had used Royal Copenhagen for many many many years and he was excited to see it online. When it arrived, we could tell immediately that it was different. For one thing, the Royal Copenhagen that he has is a dark blue liquid color whereas this one is more light blue. The scent is also off - it's not the same as the one he already has. We ended up returning it and he is in the market for a different scent. I don't know if they've changed the formula or the manufacturing company has changed the procedures used to make it but whatever it is - the change was definitely not for the better. It's okay smelling and is a nice scent but it's not the same as what it's been in the past so for someone that has used this particular cologne in the past - it would be a let down."
3,28 years with Royal Copenhagen,"I have been wearing Rayal Copenhagen for at least 28 year's - the last time I was able to purchase the ""Real"" Royal Copenhagen was in 1994 - $48.00 for 3 oz. so you know for $17.95 today it is not the real stuff - Ok - the Royal Copenhagen made by the Five Star Colonge Co. has always been very close to the old, real, Royal Copenhagen, this last bottle is the first ""batch"" that there is a very big difference. At fist use one can tell it's off by quite a ways - but as it wears for a while it comes closer - so ""it's just OK"" - For $17.95 I am not going to send it back. I just hope this is the last time a ""batch"" is this far off from the original scent."
3,They're good,I used these for my Steampunk Halloween costume. They work for a Halloween costume. Not sure if they work as real googles. My only complaint is that the only thing connecting them across the bridge of the nose is a ball chain necklace.
3,Pretty good... you get what you pay for,"The strap is cheap elastic and not very pretty, also the eye cups are placed pretty far apart with a ball chain (haven't figured out how to shorten it yet). but it came with a lens cover that has a huge scratch on it - better on the cover than the lens! the price is right and even though the hardware is cheap, i bought it for a costume to upgrade anyway."
5,Simply Awesome!!,"Not sure why people say these are uncomfortable but I've worn plenty of safety glasses/goggles that hurt like hell and these welder's goggles feel AWESOME!! Maybe they're not adjusting them well to their face. These are not swim goggles and don't need to suck your eyeball. At the same time don't expect these to feel like $100 ski goggles either. The rims of the goggles against your face are curved and smooth and not a sharp edge as some past reviewers describe. The lens is a very dark green and is made of a very thick glass. Also comes with clear plastic that are more like protective covers for the tinted glass. I plan on using them as my goto for eye protection when using a torch, cutting, grinding etc. I can also see these as being steampunk/neo-victorian if you paint them up with a flat brown and a metallic color paint, maybe a leather strap for the head and bridge of the nose. Good buy and good price at $9 and free shipping."
4,"Adjustable, usable, semi-comfortable","The lenses are removable. Twist off, with a tinted lens and clear lens inside. So if you're getting these to mod the lenses into IR vision/costume goggles, they should work. Very cool mad scientist look.The nosepiece is just a piece of metal bead chain(like they use to chain the pen to the countertop at a bank). I suspect it will break. I'll probably replace it with a piece of leather lace. I don't have a huge head, and was able to adjust it to the right size easily."
2,Not really dark enough,"We bought these as they came up when searching for solar eclipse. Unfortunately, they are not dark enough and even with a full solar eclipse they did not do an adequate job."
2,Okay for costuming,"As someone else mentioned, these are *really* uncomfortable and need to be padded.I got mine for costuming, so expected to remake these anyway. What I did not expect was to get them already chipped. The glasses I got were still in the package and when I took them out I could see that one of the lenses was chipped on the edge. Since I'm using them for a costume I was able to flip around the lenses. Sadly I got these a little late in the day, so didn't have time to return them and just have to make do."
3,They do their job but...,"These are actually REALLY uncomfortable. The hard plastic cuts into my sinuses. Adding some sort of padding around the cups makes it ALOT more comfortable. If you are doing some quick work, then I guess it'll be fine for you but if you have anything that'll take more than 2 minutes, add some padding around the cups. For those wearing these for costume pieces, do the same."
5,Fun for costumes.,These have a fun steampunk look. Highly recommended as a cheap costume accessory. I replaced the lenses with crazy custom lenses from etsy to take it to the max.
2,"Uggggghhh, frightening....","I bought this tape as the first of Cory's tapes wanting to try a new instructor. Seeing the preview as part of the Body Vision series inspired me given Cory's reputation. I will just say, I don't think her strength is in the area of teaching fitness videos. I have been working out for over ten years and was previously a fitness instructor. I found this tape to have terrible organization. Choreography in terms of music is terrible if that is something that motivates you and the exercises are jerky and outdated. I would also have to say, after working out with Tamilee Webb for years and teaching as well, I find it hard to follow someone wearing evening length earrings and a ""bumless"" back to her outfit, for an exercise video......"
3,A good introduction to Outlook 98,"A quick step-by-step guide to the most important functionality of Outlook 98. Outlook is complicated, this book is an easy read and will allow users to master the daily operation of Outlook to organize there personal information.The book as appendix on installation and working remotely. Also there is ""light"" treatment of using Outlook in a workgroup environment.I was craving more advanced topics, but this book is what most users will need."
3,Unfortunately the only 1/48 available...,"It's unfortunate that this is the only 1/48 Raptor out there (the Revell one seems to use the same mould) because it is pretty sub-par in today's market. Detail is very sparse, the fit is pretty lousy, and the painting guide is just terrible. It's nice to have a Raptor in this scale, but as for the kit itself, I hope we see a better one soon."
5,This is really pretty,"My husband loves this piece more than anything else I have and it was probably the cheepest thing i have ever got. it is all see through and that is nice. The material could probably be better, but I rrated it 5 starts, cause you know when your husband likes something that makes it a ten star. :)"
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"I am a fan of books on CD and this one is the absolute worst one that I have ever listened to. The guy is reading straight out of a book and he has a speech problem it sounds like. Also, the CD is recorded poorly, so that doesn't help the speech and it really skips around. Honestly, if you are thinking of buying this book, take the money you would have spent on it and flush it in the toilet and save yourself the time and effort because you will get the same amount of information from both."
1,Poor,Save your money and do not buy this CD. It consists of a person reading a textbook in a very dry book. He reads really fast and the poor quality of the audio makes it even worse. I can't believe that someone is actually making money off of this. I wish that I could charge someone $40.00 to make a CD of me reading from one of my college text books.
4,Nearly great...,"There may be some people who enjoy listening to only 1 type of music. Then, there are people like myself who enjoy many styles. My favorite songs on this CD are Bad Day, Walk Away, and Savin' Me. Also like Chris Brown and K T Tunstall. I mean, where else can you find all of these songs on 1 CD? Now, there are some songs that I don't care for, such as Ridin', and that is why I took off a star. However, I would recommend this CD to any lover of music. :)"
3,Now 22-- - Now?,"First of all, I wasn't familiar with half the songs on this CD, but then again. You gotta admit that Now 22 has some cool songs. I wouldn't call it the best now, but I'll just throw in some comments about a few songs:S.o.s. long song for girly-girlstempeture- I couldn't understand a word.Ridin' Popular song, but I don't know what's so good about it.Check in on it: Keeps repeating its self, you'll get tierd of it.Ms. New Booty: I dare you to listen.I'm in love: cool song with cool instraments, a bit in inappropriatePoppin' my collar: A bad song, too rappyBlack Hourses and a cherry tree: For all those country loversWalk away: a usuall kelly clarkson favoriteLet u go: I honestly thaught the All-American Rejects were the ones singing it.Move along: It's like kidz bop, it sounds like there are kids singing it!Savin' me: Sick guitar solo. Cool song, it's like nickleback's best song!Tonight I wanna cry: Uhh, too sad.. . . Hope this helps"
5,Great Compilation,Good cd that combines a great variety of songs onto one cd. Much better than buying a bunch of cd's just for that one song that you like.

2,I Hear These Songs On The Radio Everyday,These songs are played on the radio everyday. You're better off recording these songs on a blank cassette tape. Anybody who buys NOW 22 knows full well that after a while that it's going to end up in a $1.99 bin at the used CD store. It's just one of *those* CDs.
2,the same songs that are played all the time,"only two-three tracks on here carry any kind of weight with me&they are ""Chamillionaire"" Ridin Dirty"" which is a cool bounce cut. ""Sean Paul""Temperature, T-Pain"" I'm in Luv with a stripper"" was my cut. tired of hearing ""Bad Day"". ""Ms.New Booty"" is Funny. the kind of cut to laugh&crack up off of,but that is it. the Kelly Clarkson song is ok,but after that nothing gets my attention. so on a whole pretty average."
3,Now is that what YOU call music?,"Now has been making hit CDs of hits songs since the '80s. Amazing.... But 20 years later is is still goin' strong (like jeopardy) or is it fading away (like the simpsons)?As a preteen i like new music and all i have to say was this album was all hype for me. When i got it and downloaded it i realized i only like a few songs. I'll explain:1. Rihanna, SOS: The song is okat but have should have ended a minute ago. Aka. To Long.2. Sean Paul, Tempature: The song is a good dance song but what the heck is he sayin'?3. Chamillionare, Ridin': This song has so many pros and cons from me it is hard to review.And so on..... This album is okay. I like only a fifth of the songs. (1/5 of the songs i have. 2/5 of the songs are bad. 1/5 of the songs are garbagde like that kieth urban one"
3,SONG'S THROWN INTO A BLENDER,"THE PROBLEM WITH NOW 22 IS THAT IT HAS A MIXTURE OF POP,RAP, HIP-HOP,R&B;,ROCK & NOW EVEN COUNTRY.THAT IS WONDERFUL IF YOU LOVE ALL KIND'S OF MUSIC;BUT MOST PEOPLE HAVE A SINGLE FAVORITE.SO YOU WILL SKIP OVER THE KIND OF MUSIC OR SONG YOU DON'T LIKE.I WISH NOW WOULD MAKE A CD THAT IS ALL RAP,POP,ROCK OR COUNTRY.INSTEAD OF JUST THROWING A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT SONG'S INTO A BLENDER TO MAKE NOW 22.AND IF YOU NOTICE ALOT OF CD'S NOW COME WITH A BONUS DVD OR IT IS A DUAL~DISC WITH SONG'S ON ONE SIDE AND VIDEO'S ON THE OTHER.I HAVE NEVER SEEN NOW COME OUT WITH ONE YET THAT IS IN ONE SET.BUT AT LEAST THEY DO PUT 20 SONG'S ON EACH CD.(ROME,NEW YORK)/HOME OF WOODSTOCK 1999/"
1,Cool! A reference to what bands you SHOULDN'T waste your time on,"Everything on here got popular on the hit station; therefore everything on here sucks. For the most part that's true, although I must plead guilty to liking ""Move Along"" and ""Walk Away"". These compilations really make no sense though, because a lot of people who like rock hate rap, and vice versa. Why combine the two genres on a CD? Anyway, I gave up on NOW CDs when I chose to have a seven song limit of good songs on a CD for me to buy it. This CD has um; two! It's pathetic. Compilations annoy me unless they're non-album tracks. Don't buy this or any of the Now CDs, especially ones before Now 8."
1,"NO,NO,NO,NO,OH NO!","THIS IS THE ALBUM TO AVOID AT ALL COSTS IF YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT GOOD MUSIC.NOW 22 IS THE PERFECT PIECE OF TRAILER TRASH AVAILABLE IN YOUR RECORD STORE.THIS HORRIBLE CD HAS SONGS FROM EMINENTLY FORGETTABLE TRIPE LIKE THREE 6 MAFIA,NICK WACKY,CHRIS BROWN AND KELLY CLARKSON.DO YOUR SELF A FAVOUR AND AVOID THIS AS IF YOUR LIFE DEPENDED ON IT.GET THE LATEST ALBUM FROM THE RADIOHEAD VOCALIST THOM YORKE WHO IS A BILLION TIMES MORE TALENTED THAN THE LOSERS ON THIS CD.ZERO STARS."
2,Can some search for Now 23 cover?,Hi my name is Brian and all I wanna see is that Now 23 cover. Can Anyone search for it and tell me where it is if you seen it? If you seen it post a message in here and tell me where it is thanx.
1,NEVER RECEIVED MY PURCHASE!!!,I even contacted the seller to get a refund and they never responded. RIP OFF!
5,Good Service,"I just want to let you guys know that this company has good service and good product. my advice to anyone that wants good service and good chairs on time, this is the place."
2,Poor amazon product description.,This case is just a few inches too small for c-stands. Unfortunately Amazon's product description for this and the larger CCT-51 is the same. So I put this one on my wish list instead of the larger one. Boo!
2,Colorful but hard to follow,"A cute map with lots of colors and little drawings but to be frank I found it hard to use and rather confusing. The streets were so hard to follow. The info was separated on map, little booklet, I found myself constantly turning pages and if you want to just find where to go and where you are fast- you may be really frustrated by this map/book combo. I ended up not using it when I was on the road as it was just too 'fussy'"
2,Ehhh.,"Just got back from Bangkok. I ended up with three sources of Bangkok info - two travel books and the Nancy Chandler map. Of the three, I found the Nancy Chandler map and guide by far the least useful. It has lists of all sorts of things, but no real detail. The one benefit is the map of the Chatuchak Market - it's not that good a map, but it's better than having no map for this huge open market. The DK Top 10 Bangkok coupled with the free map you can pick up at the airport or hotel turned out to be much more valuable."
5,Best Map of Bangkok,"This map is great for getting around Bangkok and finding where important landmarks, parks, restaurants, river taxi stops, SkyTrain lines are in this huge city! Better than your average street map because this one gives you landmarks to look for that matter and are identifiable to tourists and expats. Must have for Bangkok, and the one for Chiang Mai is great too."
5,Randy Still Lives!,"If you're stone cold bored by today's ""music"" scene, with an endless parade of whining ""woe is me"" grunge bands (think Pearl Jam/Nirvana), complaining female wannabe poets (think Jewel), David Cassidy/Osmond Brothers retreads (think N'Sync), and shiftless hillbillies hammering out odes to their pickup trucks (think Garth Brooks), you need to get this book NOW! Plug in, crank the volume, and rock out. Listen to Randy's blistering lead playing, brutally crunching power chords (the guy exuded raw power), and his use of weird 'n' crazy phrasings. The man spoke volumes through his mastery of his instrument. In a day and age when ""nerd rock (think Bare Naked Ladies)"" and grunge bands eschew learning to actually play their instruments, Randy's deft articulation of complex melodies and harmonies still rules!"
3,Reviewing for CSSBB? - use Breyfogle,If you are studying for the Six Sigma Black Belt certificate I recommend you use Breyfogle's book as your general reference. Breyfogle's book is more complete and structured in the exams format so its easier to study and reference during the exam.Good luck.
4,coffee table,Nice blond wood coffe table set. The 2 end tables fit under the main table for storage. The whole set is easy to rearrange around the room as needed.
2,"just the jungle , PLEASE...","Timeless , we all agree was the lick. The follow-up ROS just got too experimental. Drum and Bass fans definately pick this one up, but , if this is your first venture check else where. Goldie you're the man but let's get back to the basics."
3,over-rated,"Ok, tio bitar, 10 pieces...so what. This is another piece of over-rated swedish rock. The swedish rock scene has allways had some excellent local artists but has usually exported crap ones. This is no exception."
2,This is fine for sloggers,"This one is only for people who play more cross bat shots. Again it straight bat so good for powerful guys who hit with power more than timming. Andy flower used it as he was a good sweeper. But still I would think if you wanna learn play straight(which i better cricket) and and still need a straight blade bat , go for S V1200 or newberry."
1,Not as advertised,I purchased these sticks because my son wanted the Snakes and Arrows. That is NOT what I received. I received the plain pro mark sticks with Neal Peart's name. False advertisement.
5,great gift,"i can't say if these are great sticks for actual drumming, but i do know that i gave them to a rush fan for christmas and it was a huge hit. they look awesome. these would make an awesome gift for any rush fan, even if they aren't a drummer. another band member commented that they are ""light."" i don't know if that's good or bad. but as far as being worth the price as a cool gift--totally 5 stars."
2,cheesy,"This is a pretty cheesy b type movie, but we bought it for the geocaching part of it. Will pass along to other cachers to watch."
1,Check the images,These are not the glasses pictured in the first image. The stock image implies these glasses can be worn over persctiption glasses. They cannot. The second image is what you actually receive.
3,Stay with Suitcase 8!,"Suitcase 8 is a great program. There is no way around that. If you deal with a large number of fonts in your day-to-day work, you need Suitcase 8.Suitcase 9 is another matter all together. It is a poor excuse for an upgrade. It makes your life as difficult as is humanly possible by being ""intuative"" about what you want it to do. Unfortunately, it doesn't work and play well with networks. It makes your life a living hell with certain fonts. And, worst of all, it just won't open some fonts if it doesn't want to.Our company ""upgraded"" to 9, and within days had really upgraded back to Suitcase 8. Suitcase 9 just doesn't work!Save your money... and frustration!"
2,Buy his more recent books,"This book is a predecessor to his more recent books, ""Change Your Brain, Change Your Life,"" and ""Healing ADD.He has gathered much more experience and writing ability since he wrote this book.This book is not that good, but his later books are great."
1,Not So Much...,I found the same Godzilla toy for half the price at ToysRus. I also found a Godzilla twice the size of this one for the same price at ToysRus.
4,My son idolizes this giant Japanese lizard!,"I introduced my now 4 year old son to Godzilla a few months ago, and he has become obsessed. There isn't a lot of Godzilla merchandise in circulation at this time, but am very happy to have found this. This toy is great looking, and stands up to the abuse my son dishes out on it as he re-enacts battles scenes with this along with the Mecha Godzilla toy I bought from the same manufacturer through Amazon."
1,David,These replacement bulbs are lousy. I have burned out all four with only one change of batteries. They go out while holding them and no previous bumps or jolts.
1,Defective product - burned out immediately,"Both bulbs burned out immediately. I saw that another customer reported a similar experience, but I thought I'd take a risk because I didn't see other replacement bulbs of this type on the marketplace. I don't recommend buying this product."
3,Anyone oever hear of EDITING,"First, I would like to point out I love the game, both Live Action and Paper. Now on to the Review, let's start with the good parts: - Balanced Play: The revised edition approaches LARP with a much more balanced perspective than previously available. - Documentation: The book provides considerable opportunity to truly understand the Garou perspective. - Cohesion: By using the mechanics standards presented in Laws of the Night Revised, the rulese systems are finally equal. And on to the bad points: - Editing: Possibly the most poorly edited game manual I have ever read. The placement of materials is good, but the errors are glaring. For instance, Background:Rituals says that you can buy one level of ritual per point spent. In LARP, rituals aren't leveled like theis, they are Basic, Intermediate, Advanced and not numbered."
1,A celebration?,"This book is full of [unclear] photographs. Most are so blurry that I had to wonder if they are even photos of Judy Garland. The text was poorly written and included some innacurate information. This book hardly celebrated Garlands' life for me. After I read the book, I hardly felt like celebrating!"
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"I was very disappointed by this book. The entire time I was reading it I kept asking myself, ""Can the exam really be this easy?"" The answer, NO, it is not that easy. I passed the MCSD Core Three on my first try with only books and experience to help. I consider myself a very good ""book-learner"" and I have used FrontPage from 97 through 2000.This book is inadequate for passing the exam, it should be listed under ""Learning"" not ""Certification"""
4,Great resource for MCSD exam,"David Karlin's book is a very nice resource for passing the MCSD FrontPage exam. Beyond the book itself, the supporting website is also very helpful. You can ask questions from others who have taken the exam including the author himself! He responded to a few of my questions regarding the exam very quickly. I definitely recommend this book, but the exam is tough so you'll probably need other sources as well.Good luck!FB"
5,"Cute, quirky gift","I ordered this for a friend who collects and loves all things ""Oz"". She loved it. I would recommend this item. The packaging and delivery speed were fine."
2,Back aches,"I've gotten compliments on the style, but this bag is so huge (inside and on my body) that it just gets too heavy and big. There's room for your laptop gym clothes and then some, but the structure isn't comfortable enough, especially when full. The shoulder straps aren't very good, because I have had back aches.I am going for a slimmer, more compact model."
4,music that captures spirit of the game,"Assuming you have played the game (why else would you buy this) this soundtrack perfectly transports you to those lonely fields as you and your horse traverse the landscape. Very peaceful at times, dramatic at others, always enjoyable."
3,bad company,"This is a re-release of a album released in 2000. Not quite up to par with the rest of the Bad Company albums. Bad Company is definetly one of the best drum and bass outfits out there, however this album really cant compete. If you want a bad company album, buy BAD TASTE. It is one of the best if not THE best drum and bass albums out there. If you already have bad taste, get SHOT DOWN ON SAFARI or digital nation."
5,Why didnt I look for this sooner?,We started off with a few inexpensive goldfish and always fed them the preferred Tetrafin over the cheaper brands . Our goldfish wouldnt touch any other brand which was fine with me because I thought the other stuff plain smelled bad when we tried it out.A few years later we still have all those same fish but now have two outdoor fish ponds . So glad we found that the Tetrafin Flakes were available to buy in bulk online.
1,Excellent,"I've read lots of books and criticism on Anne Bronte's works, and I still learned new things reading Elizabeth Langland's book. New ideas are presented, and all the information is very interesting, new or not. She also brings to light ideas regarding the importance of Bronte's work and what it says. Lots of people haven't ever heard of ANne Bronte, and she deserves so much more recognition for her wonderful works. I enjoyed this book very much."
1,The hell?,"the CD i recieved was a burnt copy of another album, you could say i was lucky it was even the same band but still this is bullxxxx."
2,very runny and doesn't seem to clean all the make up and dirt off my face,"This product is really runny and watery. I don't like the consistency of it and does not seem to clean my face as well as other products. I think I will stick to expensive facial cleansers, such as philosophy"
4,It is a Geat Product at keeping Breakouts to a Minimum!,My only complaint with this product is that it has made my face dryer than usual. I actually have sensitive skin that is also combination oily But...it has dried my face out in certain areas and it kinda makes my complection dull. The product does a great job keeping me from major breakouts but I still have to slather my face in moisturizer and due to having oily skin..I am not used to doing too often! But still 4 Stars!
4,One of the best facial cleansers I have found...,"Normally I don't stray from my long time standby St. Ives facial cleanser, but I fear it's being discontinued so I am testing other products to see if I can find something else just in case.I am impressed with Basis, it is similar to what I have been using in many ways. It is a light cleanser, but foams up nicely, you don't need to use a lot, the dime size recommendation is a good one. My face felt really nice and clean afterwards. I follow it up with my trusty moisturizer and I have nice smooth cheeks.Overall, I give this 4 and a half stars. 6 oz. isn't a bad size but I am used to getting 10 oz, plus I wish it was in a pump bottle. Oh well. Another drawback is that Basis isn't easy to find. I have seen it at Ulta and Walmart, not sure anywhere else though. Hopefully this isn't another product that I will like that gets the ax!Give it a try! It's good stuff...."
2,"Great Product, Terrible Service","First off, I LOVE this product, I have been using Basis for about 3 years now, its a light and crisp cleanser. However, I would not purchase from this seller again, took me over 3 weeks to get my order, and paid WAY too much in shipping(almost the cost of the product). I will be going with an amazon PRIME seller in the future."
2,Not enough instructions.,"I thought this product would remove red eye but it seems like it is nothing more than a green marker. I followed the instructions to touch the red eye but it left a green mark that just rubbed off the picture. If I left the marker on the spot long enough, it just turned the eyes white. Not impressed!!"
2,not for pet eyes....,"I ordered this to remove the ""demon"" eyes of my pet puppy, but IF your pet has green ""demon"" eyes,NOT red then this product does not work for you! I was very disappointed but realized that any black marker would do the effect I wanted and it did. This product may work on red eyes(my camera already corrected that)but if the problem is any other color---forget it!"
4,worked well,"this pen worked better for me. you have to be really careful using it, but if you dot it carefully over the red eyes, it works!!"
2,Red plastic split on first use,"The purpose of a jar lifter is to lift the jars out of boiling water. On first use of this lifter, the red plastic covering (intended to prevent slip) split in the area gripping the jar. Clearly the plastic used is not up to the task. It seemed the plastic was partially melted by the boiling water. I removed all of it. The lifter works fine without the plastic covering."
5,Go Ahead and Buy this.,Not too much can go wrong with this kind of utensil. I've had this for almost 2 years now and it's still fine. It is comfortable to hold and grabs the jars well.
3,Jar Lifter: Old kind seem to be more efficient,"This product is of high quality, but isn't efficient. The style of grip doesnt allow for quickly removing the jars for you need two hands to open and close the product. But if you are not in a rush, this products is well built."
4,jar lifter,"I do alot of canning and knew i needed a jar lifter. I researched the different brands and settled on this one. I really like it. It's not flimsy like some of the others and works very well. And i was very happy with the people from whom i bought this and the defuser, as they sent it very quickly...within days of ordering. I highly recommend this product."
2,A Somewhat Wandering Account,"I purchased this book in the hope that I would obtain a clearer understanding of Cardinal Ratzinger in terms of his role and significance during the last twenty years. However I have to say that while there is lots of information in this book along with stories and anecdotes, it fails to deliver in terms of a substantive analysis of the church since vatican II and where the church will be as we move further into this the 21st century. At the conclusion of the book Allen hinges his critical description of the Cardinal in terms of the next conclave including a list of reasons why Ratzinger will not be Pope. If that is not enough he then goes further to sujest that in the event that he is wrong and Ratzinger does become Pope all of the difficulties he would envisage with such a papacy. The issues which he attampts to examine are far to complex in nature to be benchmarked of nothing other than his own futuristic and prophetic beliefs. Sorry to be so negetive."
1,Wish We Still Had the Index...,I gave my wrong email address before: it is jhughes93@hotmail.com. This book should be on the Index in Rome; no good can come of it.
3,"New Review, 5 Stars","I have to delete my first review, as i have not done justice to this Chandos recording. Please refer to my comments on the Polyansky.Here in this release you get the incredible Concerto Grosso, with Viktoria Postnikova on piano, Rozh's wife and Saha Rozhdestvensky on violin, their son. Another supreme masterpiece from Schnittke. Their talents are well suited to Schnittke and show forth the wonderful musical skills this family posesses. The 8th is close to the other Chandos release with Polyansky. I may prefer the Polyansky, but am very very happy to have this second copy of the incredible 8th sym.PaulBaton RougeJune2,2006"
5,Fine shotshell boxes.,"I have a couple of these 12 gauge boxes, and they're great. I didn't really need the 3.5"" supermag boxes, but they work just as well.The plastic itself is sturdy. The latch is fine, and the hinges are as solid as you'll find on a plastic box. There are tabs that you can put a small padlock through that should suffice to keep the kids out of the ammo.The organizational capacity is good. There are 20 slots for individual shells, and you can put another 5 in the accessory slot without them rattling around too much. The box will accommodate both the standard 2.75"" and 3"" magnum shells,of course, and if I ever get a gun chambered for 3.5"" I'll be all set (see customer image). The boxes stack well too, which is nice.I'm happy with the purchase."
5,Well written,"This book explains everything you need to do , in order to become a LEO in California. Makes sure to review the writing portion of this book if you are taking a writing test soon."
5,Good preparation book for the California Post Police Exam.,"I have been studying this book for the past 4 months it is very helpful to prepare you for the California Post police exam. I first checked this book out from the library. But it was so useful to me that I bought it here at Amazon. So far I have pass one test with one police department, but I am still trying other departments. This book focuses more on the California post model style be advise that some Police Departments use their own test and not the post exam. For example, San Diego Police Department, Escondido Police Department, Beverly Hills Police Department and so on. Before you take a written test be sure to ask if the department uses the Post exam. This book is great preparation and I recommended to anyone who wants to prepare for the California Post police exam."
1,Not good,There is very little in this book that is in the real CA Post Pellet B. If you graduated high-school you should be able to pass any police officer exam in CA. If you have to buy a book to study up on basic reading and writing then you should look for another career.
5,CPOA Approved,"The CPOA (California Peace Officer's Association) has finally given their approval to one of the peace officer preparation books. Although there are many books, this is the first book to be written with California's Civil Service testing process in mind. Other states have different methods for application, but this book zeros in on the information needed for California. I recommend this book to any applicant for a California Peace Officer position."
1,Where do they get this stuff???,"I bought this book to review for the police exam and completely failed! The examples in the book didn't look anything like the questions in the actual exam. I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talking about, but this can't be the book that they're claiming to be good. It was a total waste of money."
3,Mouthpiece for Eisenman,"The main problem with this book is that Robert Eisenman is not credited as a co-author. Essentially everything is written to harmonize with Eisenman theories, so much so in fact that he must have had significant input to its content.I cannot find fault with the author's dating of the sectarian scrolls, and how conventional scholars neglect the obvious in favor of their cherished presuppositions (and institutional paymasters) but the real ""deception"" is hardly that the scrolls are the work of early Christians. More likely, the scolls were composed by enemies of the early Christians - most probably by followers of John the Baptist. Obviously Christian scholars won't go there, but as Eisenman does not believe that Jesus even existed, then clearly the authors can't go there either."
4,"Great investigative reporting, documented, action charged.","Well written, political, passionate, relevant. I am a journalist and would love to have had my hands at this kind of evidence, this world cause, and the questions that arise. I need a new edition by the same authors, five years hence. Nicolas Luco, editor of Siglo 21, El Mercurio, Santiago, Chile"
2,Big buildup then a whimper...,"I've read other books by Baigent and Leigh, they are typically quite interesting and thought provoking (their minds work in twists and turns that are intriguing to me). But this book left me flat. I read a different version of this book, I think the second printing of it. They built up a lengthy story of how the scrolls were suppressed and hidden and how there were undoubtedly amazing secrets within which we were being wilfully denies access to. Then in the very last page they announce that in fact a University in California has the complete scrolls and are publishing them all. So much for the secret pact to prevent us from knowing the truth. The book is interesting for the historical perspective and of course for the intrigues and twists Baigent and Leigh always toss in, but it left me pretty flat with that revelation (Saved for the absolute end, no less)."
5,The best of Baigent,"Perhaps I shouldn't review a book I have not quite finished, but I've been asked.This is the best and as far as I can tell (and I have followed the developments closely since Edmund Wilson's New Yorker piece in the late 1940s) the most accurate and carefully reasoned account of the rather scandalous failure in Dead Sea scroll scholarship. Though I dislike the use of ""Deception"" in the title--too tabloid-like--I can't really disagree with it, finally. Whereas in some of his books (I'm thinking especially of ""The Jesus Papers,"" toward the end) Biagent seems all too easily to build inference on speculation upon dubious interpretation, I find little of that sort here. I recommend the book to anyone interested in the histories of pre and post-Temple Judaism and Christianity and the history of the scrolls themselves over the past sixty years."
2,Not history and not bible scholarship,"This book is not history and it isn't bible scholarship either. Baigent and Leigh are known for several books, including this one, that are on the edge between history and off the wall unreasonable conjecture.There is a time for books like this one. Some of the time they are fun to read, and one of the other books by this pair did make a good premise for someone else's novel. But it would be best not to think you are reading history when you read this.There is plenty of real amazing stuff in the Dead Sea Scrolls, and now that the scholars have had a decade to sift through the fragments that had been hidden from them for decades, we ought to be seeing popular books on what they have found.But this is not it."
3,"Worth reading, but the authors clearly have an agenda","The book does give a really interesting account of the history of finding the dead sea scrolls. It undoubtedly describes some extremely dubious scholarly practices by those who held onto the scrolls for 40 or more years and published very little. I do get the feeling, however, that other writers might have taken the same facts and produced a book with far less sensastionalism. Read the book -- it is interesting -- but I'd be cautious about how hard I jumped onto this particular bandwagon."
2,Ho-hum nothing new here,"This book is the Cliff Notes version of Jodie Foster's life. It is pretty to look at but doesn't offer anything new for Jodie Foster fans. Most of the info has been rehashed before in a variety of other sources (books, magazines, interviews, et al). If you lead a pristine life, know nothing about Jodie Foster, and enjoy brevity and a light lunch, then this is the book for you. If you like dirt, then dig through her brother Buddy's tell all book FOSTER CHILD. Everything else is a secret."
5,This is a great game....,It rivals the mighty metal gear 2 on sony playstation 2. I reccommend it for everyone. This game has great expansive outdoor environments. It is a real intense orientated game where you sneak around a city as a bounty hunter looking for your reward. Very good game.
5,Lucid and informative account of Cantonese marriage patterns around 1900,"Stockard's Daughters of the Canton Delta describes many Cantonese marriage customs a century ago in considerable details. I have been trying to understand the social and cultural backgrounds of my own black and white amah or majie. I have found this book far more detailed, absorbing and enjoyable than any other book I have read on the subject."
2,"Merely charming, nothing more","I can't say I really disliked the music, but it is no masterpiece. The themes are cute and charming, but sound as though they could be the background music for Zelda or Final Fantasy. I'm not really partial to this style, however it's easy listening and very relaxing. ""Japanese Spring"" and ""Galadriel"" are probably the best on the CD."
5,COLOUR OF LIGHT,"I FIRST HEARD KARUNESH ABOUT 5 YEARS AGO WHILE LISTENING TO DMX THRU MY CABLE SYSTEM. I IMMEDIATELY WROTE DOWN THE NAME OF THE SONG...""DAWNLIGHT""....AND STARTED CALLING AROUNG TO SEE IF I COULD FIND THE ALBUM THE SONG WAS ON. NOW I HAVE THIS ALBUM AND I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED. I WILL BE BUYING THE REST OF HIS MUSIC. DECIDE FOR YOURSELF THOUGH....IF YOU LIKE HIS MUSIC THEN BUY IT!!"
5,Preflight and File Preparation,I highly recommend this book. It is the best book I have ever read on the subject. Other books did not provide enough information. They were too technical and related to people wanting to go into printing rather than graphic designers. This one is excellent and will make your printing assingments better and faster then ever.
4,Cute!,This show and other Holly Hobbie shows entertain my kids ages 3 and 4. The story is simple and sweet.
3,You bet,"I love the Cranberries. I love Dolores O'Riordan; I can't even name any of her bandmates. And I really like her first solo album. It's fashionable, it's sincere, and it's very pretty. But it isn't pretty in the same way that Enya's music is pretty: that kind of prettiness is so thin it might as well not even exist. There's depth to the shine of these songs, depth arising as much from Dolores' heritage, which bursts through every thickly-accented syllable of her vocals, as from her no-nonsense sentiments. I like it a lot, but it isn't for everybody--just those that like O'Riordan, Ireland, the Cranberries, or feminist rock."
3,Dolores - Divina,"DO'R intrigues me with her powerful personality, disarming honesty and formidable musical talent. This album does not change my opinion and is a must for admirers but is flawed by the studio recording. Not only is the sound quality inadequate but please compare her astounding rendition of ""Ordinary Day"" on Amazon's video sampler taken from a live concert where you would have died for this woman! WHOEVER OWNS THE COPYRIGHT OF THIS CONCERT, PLEASE GET IT ONTO DVD."
4,Glad she's back,"I love the Cranberries, and when I saw that Dolores O'Riordan had put out a solo disk I was stoked. It's a great CD, sounds a lot like the Cranberries (which I like; makes sense, too, cause she wrote most of the Cranberries' songs). Definitely recommended if you're a Cranberries fan."
4,Dolores O'Riordan,This is only album I have of her solo stuff but I really enjoyed it. Similar to the Cranberries but slightly more pop. There's only one bad song on there in my opinion.
4,Good solo CD from Dolores O'Riordan,"It's not quite as good as her Cranberries-era stuff, but it's still worth listening to.I caught her recent tour promoting the CD; it's a good show."
5,The Bomb,"This album is off the chain, it doesn't like any diffent the a great Cranberries album, guess we see where the fame rose from, her voice is as strong as ever, tracks 1 and 2 are unreal. The whole album is great, it's a throwback to a simpler time in life, the 90's when we were young and life was easy!"
2,"The answer is, not until she gives me a better reason","Granted, it's not quite ""I Just Shot John Lennon"" bad (and let's not dwell upon that official Worst Rhyme in Musical History), but it's not exactly good, either. Even ""Ordinary Day,"" the single and easily the best song on the album, piles on the lyrical cliches to a painful degree while failing to do anything remotely innovative musically. Not recommended unless your musical outlet of choice is Starbucks.O'Riordan's lovely voice deserves better than her songwriting has been able to deliver recently. There's so much better stuff out there. Pick up Sinead O'Connor's ""Faith and Courage,"" or Vienna Teng's ""Waking Hour,"" or Imogen Heap's ""Speak for Yourself,"" or Tori Amos's ""American Doll Posse,"" or those first two Cranberries albums for that matter, before getting anywhere near this tepid ""comeback."""
3,Same old same old,"This is just ""No need to argue"" all over again. Dolores was the Cranberries, so why should we expect anything different?"
2,New CD!,"...Really, as a Cranberrie's Fan, I will wait the Japanese Version W/3 Bonus Tracks, coming soon May 31!The Tracks are:Letting Go, Forever, and Sisterly Love.Track Listings1. Ordinary Day2. When We Were Young3. In the Garden4. Human Spirit5. Loser6. Stay with Me7. Apple of My Eye8. Black Widow9. October10. Accept Things11. Angel Fire12. EcstasyJapan Only Exclusive Bonus Tracks:13. Letting Go14. Forever15. Sisterly Love"
4,A most welcome return,"Such a beautiful voice captured on disc is a rare thing... the truth is that Dolores O'Riordan could hold an audiance if she were simply to read the phone book aloud. The songs here are personal and draw you in. Some of the songs sound as if they came from the logical progression of the Cranberries, while others prove that while O'Riordan was the voice of the Cranberries she was not allowed to expand her range like she does on ""Are You Listening"". The disc is a great listen through and through and I have a difficult time thinking of the disc as individual songs... it works best as a whole... I highly recommend this release to her old fans and to those who appreciate her vocal touch."
4,I like that she is the same,"I dont know what is going on with the cranberries. I havent heard anything bad, but, this is a good sign that Delores is still going strong. I feel for her loss and the lyrics are darker than ever even though the melody is mellow. She has stayed true to her passonate side of the music. I really have enjoyed this Cd for the past few days. I hope to hear more from her and more importantly from the 'cranberries' since they are one of the founders of my musical obsession.Thanks so much guys! you rock!"
4,that bueatiful voice from the cranberries is back,"What a great debue solo album. I found the first half of the album awsome some of the second half dropped off a bit, but over all a great album. If you like the cranberries I think you will really like this."
2,NOT as advertised in picture and NOT worth 50 dollars,"One would assume that if you are going to spend fifty dollars on a spice rack, there would be no skimping on quality. The picture and descriptions of this item would have you believe that the spice holders themselves would be stainless steel or some form of at least aluminum. They even add a nice metallic sheen in the picture. In addition, you would think that with fifty dollars they would make the core glass or at least a strong composite. The shakers clear area is a cheap plastic. The stand itself appears durable but the shaker color does not match the stainless steel stand or my other stainless appliances. It actually looks cheap next to them. I would not recommend this product and will likely return this item. Positives include a strong base and magnets that work. I have no other compliments."
5,Sci-fi like only Harry can do,"I absoluetly loved this book. So very realistic and compelling. The characters, both human and minervan, are engaging and well devloped. The story could very easily be considered both alternate history or straight sci-fi. This book has been overlooked by many sci-fi fans by Turtledove's more well-known books. That to me is a shame. I would love to see a sequel to this book to see how Earth and Minerva grow together and how each affects the other's societies.Read this book once and then read it again. You will enjoy it from cover to cover. This book is proof that Harry Trutledoveis one of the masters of Sci-fi/Alternate History."
3,Interesting,If you enjoy turtledove novels this will interest you. Sci-fi with great writing the story left some to be desired but the world that turtledove created will keep you interested almost to the end.
5,seductive...,"In this cd Brendel gives Chopin what he deserves: beautiful piano performance. After all, could anyone resist beauty?"
4,"So much promise, pity it was rushed","Tribes 2 had so much potential when it was under developement. Teamplay, integrated clan support, ability to use vehicles, infinate distance engine etc...Even though the game was made some time ago the graphics still look great, it runs smoothly and can be great fun.Unfortunately, Sierra seem to have forced Dynamix to rush it out the door (Dynamix soon closed after the release) meaning many promising features where left half finished. The command screen interface for instance looked fantastic, but is ultimately fairly useless for genuinely controlling a team. The community features all shut down soon after release and the flurry of patches that came out afterwards failed to address all issues before Dynamix went under.A real shame...but still great fun to play"
1,"Dont buy this game , you wont be able to play it","First off look at the dates of all the other reviews , they are pre 2005 mine is 2011.I bought this game last year and i found out that the company that made tribes shut down the tribes site and in order for you to play the game you have to be hooked up to the site. My game would never finish completly setting up, because of this issue. Dont trust me read up on it on the internet, just trying to save some people some money and aggravation."
4,Tribes 2,"This game is a lot of fun and brings back good memories of the original Tribes series. Sierra actually made this game ""free"" so if you look out on the internet for a little you can find it, but it's around 500mb for the installer ([...]) so it might just be worth buying the original CD. If you like this game, I suggest trying out the newer Tribes Vengeance."
1,"Placebo, at best","Having been fed this product every day between the ages of 14-17 i can reasonably say it has no effect. My behavioural problems as a teenager stemmed from my relentless bullying in high school (something my parents where blissfully unaware of, preferring to think of me as the problem). If your teenager is difficult to deal with then talk to them and their school CALMLY about it and try to find and address the cause of the problem and DON'T just medicate against it (unless proscribed by a medical professional)."
2,You get what you pay for,"I purchased the combo for my husband. The ear piece did not work, neither did the car charger. The only reason I did not return item, hubby did not want to use the phone without a case."
1,not what it claims,"Boxwave claimed to be non slip surface, not even close to that, slides off car armrest very easy. Says it has textured back to stay in place, but is smooth as glass. My Belkin stays in place. Says scarlet red but does not say transparent see through red. Disappointed in color and lack of non skid surface. Top button is not a good fit, difficult to shutoff."
1,CONDITION NOT AS ADVERTISED,"Very disappointed with this item from TSCBooks, not even worth one star. It was advertised as NEW but it was definitely very used, it even had a TJ Maxx price label on the back! The book was badly bent and both front and back covers were scratched. TSCBooks need to change their ad and adjust their price accordingly. If I had wanted a used book I would have ordered a used one, but I wanted a NEW BOOK! Delivery was also very slow, it took 2 weeks to arrive (I chose this seller as they were in my state, CA). I will not be using this seller, TSCBooks, again.I had already borrowed this book from my local library so was familiar with its contents. The book itself is great, it has some great easy to follow recipes with lovely colored photos (or they would be lovely if my copy wasn't so crumpled)."
1,Very poor quality in deed,"The glass container cracks during the cooking process. Very poor quality.The worst is the heating device. You must wipe it clean immediately after use. Otherwise, the fiber from the food will be stuck on the heating device (the filter does not catch all) and cannot be cleaned off easily w/out using more water. Then, the electrical of the heating devide will break and the whole machine is useless. Worse than buying just the blender."
2,Fragile Carafe,The soy milk maker itself is good but our Carafe was very Fragile and cracked after not very heavy use. It may have been tapped lightly against the porcelain sink while washing but definitely no rougher than you'd treat any ordinary glass. For this reason I really can't recommend it. Get a stainless model.
4,"Not So Sure How ""Lost"" These Tracks Are...",...But they are certainly some of the best stuff to come out of the 80s...you'll regret NOT having these songs!
1,Didn't do a thing to my hair,"This product didn't do anything to my hair. Some of the others are saying its a fake so maybe I received a fake one. I use the BB Sumo Tech and that is one of the best products I've ever used so I would have expected more from this. After half an hour of applying it, my hair felt dry after the water evaporated. I think if I used body lotion on my hair it would have been more effective."
4,works great,"On the bottle, it's noted that this product can be used as either a rinse out or leave in conditioner. I haven't yet used it as a rinse out conditioner...only as a leave in conditioner. It definitely makes my hair soft but for a cheaper alternative, my suggestion is Sunsilk Hydra TLC. It's a small pink bottle, available at any local CVS or even at the grocery store. It works just as well, or slightly better than this product."
5,"Replenished, finally",My hair gets very dry and frizzy in the summer. With color and daily abuse my hair begins to look parched. My hair is very fine so many products easily weigh down my hair (even some wash out conditioners) but this was perfect. It quenched my dry hair without making it greasy or weighted down. I don't use it every day but I don't feel I need to. A few times a week keeps my hair looking healthy.
3,OK product,"I ordered this product to replace the original (stolen) charger that came with my drill. This charger does not charge the battery nearly as fast as the original. I also have a problem that the charger was advertised as new, but did not come in any packaging. It was delivered in just the shipping envelope with not even an owners manual. It does charge my battery, but I can't be sure of what the indicator lights are for. It would have been nice to know for sure my purchase was in fact new and have the paperwork to show it is being used correctly."
2,limited information on product,"Unit arrived with no information on use, care or what specific batteries that are compatable with unit. Of the three 'post' type batteries I needed to charge [B&D,Hitachi and Skil]only Hitachi was compatable."
2,not so universal as I hoped,"I purchased one of these, based upon numerous positive reviews and my own experiences with the Hitachi brand, in order to replace the charger that came with my old Harbor Freight (yeah, I know) cordless drill. Alas, this charger did not quite match the terminals on the HF Ni-Cad battery and I had to return it. Since it is advertised as a ""universal charger"" when it clearly isn't, I am obliged to give it two stars.As always, thank you, Amazon, for the no-hassle return policy."
4,Great charger,"This was a great replacement charger. The cooling fan is a little loud, but I guess it's good to keep the unit from overheating."
4,Hitachi UC18YRL charger,"Cheap, light, and it works on both Ni-Cad and Ni-Mh. You have to pay close attention to the blinking light pattern"
3,"No packaging, worked okay.","Item was supposed to be a gift, but it arrived in standard shipping box without any manufacturing packaging. Cord was simply tied with rubber band and item had some minor scratches on base. It was labeled as new but looked used. Since I was giving as a gift, it was a bit disappointing. The gift recipient didn't seem to mind, however, and the charger worked as intended."
3,For the craft challenged,"I agree with the other reviewer that there shouldn't be 'quilted' in the title. That being said, this book is great for someone that loves the country look and wants some easy projects. I would even call this book good for the 'craft challenged'. Applique, easy embroidery, and some simple patchwork piecing are all in here. I bought it for the Santa Doll as I have a friend that collects them. There were some other nice easy projects that I made, like the Santa Stocking. If you want to make some country Christmas items and are craft challenged, this book could be helpful for you."
3,Wedding Ministry,This book has a good look at the contemporary wedding services for the new Pastor.Much of this books ceremonies are just reprints of standard wedding text. However I enjoyed the introduction and the general set-up of the text.~ Pastor Dave Plunkett
1,"Old School--like, Paleolithic","This item is in-line with a evangelical or conservative perspective--with an emphasis on personal commitment to Jesus Christ and on gender roles based on conservative reading of scripture. I would not recommend this for most new pastors if they consider themselves mainline, liberal, progressive, or even emerging. It did not resonate in my progressive, urban ministry."
4,Serendipity,"I rarely venture outside the classical mainstream, but in acquiring thisCD from Amazon.ca I came to see that exploring the lesser known composers can surprise and delight. This is a wonderful CD comprising four symphonies by Carl Stamitz, featuring the London Mozart Players. I especially enjoy the Symphony in D Major 'La Chasse', or 'The Chase'. This relatively little known work comprises three movements, with the lilting Andante particularly enjoyable. This CD is a valuable addition tomy CD library.AGM"
5,Perfect!,"Love Mother Angelica & the sisters. Using this cd has helped strengthen my prayer life & it makes me feel closer to the Blessed Virgin & her Son, Jesus Christ. Thank God for Mother Angelica!"
2,"Yetter has more than ""Guitar Trouble"" to worry about","After reading all the reviews I had to order this CD right away. I couldn't wait for this CD to arrive, after all the comparasions to SRV and Hendrix, I'm thinking this is got to be hot.... NOT! What a waste of $18.00. Yetter's guitar playing is good but the sound mix on the rest of the band is terrible, on some tracks it sounds like they were playing five blocks away. The song selections are weak to mediocre to add to the ""guitar trouble"" on this over-hyped album. I'm convinced most of the reviewers on this CD are friends or family of R.C. Yetter. I do think HE has potential but some re-tooling is necessary. Obviously there is a reason why Yetter is so obscure and he will stay that way unless he surrounds himself with higher quality people from top to bottom. Please no more comparasions to SRV and Hendrix....it's insulting to me and unfair to Yetter."
1,SRV......NOT,"Don't waste your money on this CD. 1 or 2 songs worth listening. If you like SRV and Hendrix, check out Wes jeans and stay away from RC Yetter....and Jonny Lang...(the new one...)"
1,RC.YETTER/NO SRV,"R.C. YETTER, A STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN WANNA BE. NO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES, HE IS NOTHING MORE THAN A DISGRACE TO SRV. STEVIE I HOPE YOUR EARS ARE COVERED WHEREVER YOU MAY BE."
5,Wow this is perfect for 3 wire cooling fans,"I love this fan controller. It's small so you could stick it inside or even outside your computer. It comes with double sided tape. It has smooth step-less variable speed adjustment. It also allows you to still be able to read the rpm speeds from your attached fan. It comes with a nice long wire so you could use it in super large computer cases if needed.I purchased this controller because my 3-wire CPU fan doesn't allow speed control from the motherboard which has a 4 pin connecter. My fan is also quite expensive being a special low profile ball bearing unit with copper heat sink. This controller was the perfect solution for my problem and cheap too. My computer CPU fan was running at 5300 rpm with no way to control the speed, now it runs at 3000 rpm on the lowest speed setting and MUCH quieter and still able to maintain cool operating temps."
2,It would be great if it worked...,This would have been exactly what I needed to control my case fan but it did nothing at all. I even tried buying the same controller from a different retailer and it did not work either. I tried it on my CPU fan and it had no effect. It should be plug-n-play according to the directions on the back of the package so I don't know if I am doing something wrong or not. Other than that I like the design; the cord is very long and was able to reach from the front of my computer to the back so that I could have the controller on the outside of the case. Hope others have better luck with it...
2,Not good,"Fan speed before install was around 2500 RPM, after install it was around 2250 when controller was all the way up. As I turned it down nothing happened until it was all the way down, then it suddenly dropped to 1250 RPM. There is nothing in between. And if I shake or touch the button with it all the way down the fan speed will jump to 2250. It just does not work as it should, I finally got it to stay at 1250 but if it gets bumped it will jump back to 2250. I would not recommend."
3,It is what it is,"Usually, I leave this at its lowest setting. But, when I know that I am going to play an intense graphics game, I crank it up to max. It is unfortunate that this has to trail out of the case, but it is not observable unless one looks for it, so it is fine."
5,shakespeare follower,"This is a stellar revision of William Shakespeares Hamlet. The selection for the cast is perfect with amazing actors like David Tennant, Patrick Stewart, & Penny Downie.David Tennant puts such incredible energy into the character of Hamlet capturing you from beginning to end."
5,Best of the Modern Best,"The difference between the Royal Shakespere Company and, say, a Shakespere in the Parks production of Hamlet is that the Parks version -think- they fully understand the text (and maybe they are almost there), but the Royal Company actually DO fully live and breathe it. This is an outstanding modern production."
5,Best Portrayal of Hamlets Character I've ever seen,"Another reviewer already commented on how the sets are grand enough to be the palace of a King and Queen, yet Hamlet in his blue jeans does not seem out of place. And that Ophelia's acting is a bit flat until she goes crazy. All true.What I wanted to expand on is Tennant's portrayal of Hamlet is probably much closer to what Shakespeare intended than any other I've seen. His madness is not a permanent flux of sad to angry and back to weeping I've seen so many actors use. His responses to his friends, the acting troupe, Polonius are so natural and aware. I am probably describing it poorly but just let me say in the at least 6 versions I have seen of this play I have never hung on Hamlets words and expressions as I have with this. It was a very enjoyable experience and I have watched it more than once to get all of the nuance he brings to the role. Hamlet has never been so intricate or so alive before."
4,Classic DB!!!,"This CD is made up mostly of previously released material. But there are 6 cuts that are new and they are all perfect. I program my player to cycle these songs-Jesus do yor hands still feel the rain/Christmas at Glasgow/Plastic shoes/All I want/Walking back home/When you are Young-like an EP. The best thing is all these cuts are are softly produced with great harmonies and instrumentation. Ricky softly croons his best poetry to easy rolling sad tinged tunes. Think RainTown and your there. P.S.> If you don't have thier CD ""Ohh Las Vegas"" your missing half of DBs best work."
2,Weakest of the 10 I've Read,"I finally gave Grafton's ""alphabet"" series featuring Kinsey Millhone a try with ""P Is For Peril"" a year or two ago, when it was the newest of the series. I liked ""P"", and I've since been working my way through the rest, starting with ""A"" -- I've now reached ""I.""I think ""H Is For Homicide"" is the weakest I've read. Much of the book has Kinsey undercover, living with some crooks and auto insurance fraud artists in Los Angeles. The plot doesn't seem to advance very quickly in these segments, and Kinsey's acerbic observations begin to pall. We're left with a generally static narrative of fairly pointless minor incidents among uninteresting, vaguely threatening people. Kinsey's better when she's rushing around among a variety of mainly middle class specimens, observing their tastes and foibles, in my opinion.The good news is that ""I Is For Innocent"" was a welcome return to form."
1,H is for Homicide,"I have read all of the series up to ""N"". I loved all of them except for ""H"". All she seemed to do was go to the bar with them or hang out in their apartment (and describe it. No action as in other books. I, J, K, L, M and N were great. Don't judge the series by this one. I started with M and went back to A and read on."
5,Absolutely the best female PI,"I bought this audio book to replace one I had worn out. Sue Grafton has created the most realistic and likeable PI ever. I love her books, but she has turned me into a ""pusher"" in that I have gotten a number of friends hooked on Kinsey and her exploits."
2,Boring Book About An Insurance Scam,"This is a boring book about an insurance scam that is conducted by a Hispanic sociopath with Tourette's Syndrome. I could not get myself to care a hoot about the outcome or any particular character.I'd skip this book and try""A"" is for Alibi (The Kinsey Millhone Alphabet Mysteries)."
3,Fraud in the barrio,"Private Investigator Kinsey Millhone is checking out the death of an insurance claims adjuster and trying to link it with a gang who is running a fraudulent claims racket, involving car accidents. She befriends the hooker girlfriend of a gang leader in the Los Angeles barrio, purposely hitiing a policewoman so as to be locked up overnight in a cell with her. She is tentatively accepted as a gang member, allowed to take part in the scams but closely watched at all times. It's an exciting, fast read with plenty of descriptions of barrio life, morals and codes, which holds the reader's interest, so much so that I'll be looking out for some more of these alphabet stories."
5,It could only happen to Kinsey.,"Then again only Kinsey could get herself into so much trouble and on gang turf in Los Angeles trying to investigate an insurance fraud claim for California Fidelity. The latter, who has just been bought out and is now run by an efficiency expert, wants to renegotiate her long-standing employment agreement with the previous bosses. Can Kinsey crack the case and save her job? Will she escape the clutches of Luis, Raymond and company in time to buy a new dress for Vera Lipton's wedding? You will have to read it to find out. Stay tuned for futher episodes of Kinsey Millhone."
2,"Well written, but a snore of a plot","My first Sue Grafton book, probably my last. I'd read the reviews noting the realism of her heroine, etc. and I liked the character. But does Grafton ever deliver with a little excitement in her plots? This thing goes on and on and not once was I absorbed. I like a little tension in a mystery. Even the dangerous dog is of course quickly revealed to be a pussy cat. Yawn."
2,H is for Ho-Hum,"Bang! This Millhone series novel starts off almost immediately with the murder. Ms. Millhone is more a hostage with the bad guys than a PI in this one. With all the cops available in the police department, they recruit her to go undercover. Oh, please.The murder turns out to be part of a large auto insurance fraud scheme.Not much at all is developed from the initial murder. There's also a chapter in the beginning wherein California Fidelity has a new local boss. Millhone bucks heads with him. The matter doesn't come up again until the very last sentence of the book.The novel is boring, tedious, & ridiculous. It's easy to put down, which I almost did twice. It seems Sue Grafton tried a new avenue in this story. Unfortunately it fails terribly. I've read a good dozen in this series. I liked the series until this one came along.Do yourselves a favor, go from ""G"" straight to ""I"". This book just fails to come together"
5,very satisfied with the book and the service!,The book was just as described and arrived even earlier than I had hoped. Arrived in excellent condition. Sue Grafton is an excellent mystery writer. Each of her books starts with the a different letter of the alphabet. She's now up to U
1,Al Mawrid Al Quarib,"I picked this up with the Al Mawrid and Hans Wehr. It's not worth buying simply because the print quality is so bad it's tough to tell what letter you're looking at. Stick with the good dictionaries, this isn't one of them."
5,Just what I needed...,"I had a CD player from Europe that I was loathe to throw out and unlike the simple converter from ""Wally World"" this did the trick. It's a bit heavy for my wife with sharp edges, so mind the kids and don't drop it on your foot (or a wood floor). Other than that, for small appliances, this is dead on, a great product."
4,Excellent helper!,"I was able to use my 220V gadget in this 110V country and I loved it, such a nice helper!"
1,heavy!!!,"The item was much heavier then I accepted; considering that most people would not expect this, the weight of the item should have been listed very CLEARLY."
1,Do not buy this junk,"This ""product"" came with dents, in pieces, wrong product it does not step up but only down and it has missing pieces. Do not buy from this provider. They are just trying to steal your money.1 star because there is no chance to put zero or negative stars...I feel lucky I am in the US to be able to return it for free, but I am very sorry for the people from other countries, that will have to pay a bunch of money to return it back and guess...many will choose not to return it because it will be very expensive.. So, a money robbery in the end...Please do really make case of this negative ratings. I would imagine that the same people who are stealing our money are the ones who write reports talking good of this products and rating them with more than 1 star..."
1,Don't buy this !,I bought this and plugged it in and it burned up in front of me ! No quality at all in this transformer .
5,Exceptional!,"A beautifully illustrated collection of children's songs organized by various themes such as ""Praise to God"" and ""God Cares for Me."" This is a great book for a beginning pianist or guitarist. My 4 year old grandson enjoyed looking at the detailed illustrations"
1,Piece of garbage,I bought this toy for my son for Christmas. It was very easy to put together. It was also very to play with. The unfortunate part was the fact that one of the motors burnt out with 30 minutes of taking the toy out of the box. Mattel basically told me to get lost. I will never by one of their products again. What a waste of $30. I would of been better off burning the money.
4,A little too much,"My 6 year old LOVED this. I mean, REALLY loved it. Problem was, he ran it so much that we ran through batteries like there was no tomorrow. It was fun, once he figured out the schematics of the whole thing, he wouldn't leave it alone. It was noisy, but that didn't bother him. Setting up the 'globe' to knock down became too much of a hassle for him, as he couldn't figure out how to get it together, so he gave up on that but still adored the thing. Unfortunately, it took up too much space in his small room and had to be given up to make room for other stuff. Poor kid. Once we took it apart, we could never find every piece for it again. Thankfully he was happy with the fact that he got to keep the cool cars. I'd definitely recommend this toy, though, to anyone with the space for it. Pretty cool. Keep a stock of batteries on hand!"
5,Good quality,This was a gift for a teenager it was a nice gift good quality but not a heavy fleece but did the job
2,It's ok,"This book didn't seem to help me much. Except how I should present my drawings. Yes, it is a ok book. But, Fashion sketchbook is hands down much better than this book."
1,I wouldn't even pay $19.99 for this! Joke table?,"I cannot believe this table costs this much? Is there some mistake here? First of all the table looks like it should be a doll house item!(I would not use this for a child's toy, they are better than this) If you would put anything on it, a coffee mug, a little plant (a very teeny plant, I might add) it would just about fit. I would not put anything on this flimsy piece of junk! Table top doesn't fit properly on stem. Defective garbage! Made in China, of course!"
3,Not Impressed...,"I bought this for my daughter who loves Dora. We already have Dora bedding and I thought this would be a nice decor addition to her room. The fabric boxes are smaller than normal ones. They also have no handles. The growth chart is a very cheap stuffed, almost thin pillow. The coat rack actually folds, so there is a huge, very visible line down the center of it. The picture frame and the book ends are cute and pretty well constructed. I could have done without the cheap hangers. Overall, I'd say buy this if you want some bookends but I don't think it's worth it otherwise."
3,chinese quality,"For the most part the items are fine. The coat rack is split in half and the images don't line up. 3 year old daughter doesn't notice, so what more could you ask for."
5,A Real Gem,"If you train in the Bujinkan, or the martial arts this is a book that will grow with your training as you do. So many times I've just opened it and started reading from any point and there is always something new, another layer to look at what sensei is saying."
3,Bought this saw...................,"........Previously ""unseen"" and Therefore UNKNOWN.It is ""ok""; and I say that 'Because'..................the Teeth ARE SMALL and CLOSE TO EACH OTHER.It ""Cuts OK"" on Small Branches/Limbs; but I ""hesitate"" to Expect MUCH ""when cutting through SEVERAL INCHES Of Wood""."
4,Great Bookshelf System! jWIN JXCD8700 4-CD/MP3 CD Vertical-Loading Hi-Fi System (,"This system is very retro looking - It stands upright and is about 5"" deep- a good small space unit. The 4 cds are in the face of the unit - easy to load and unload. For a small unit, this has great sound. Con's would be very small buttons on the face of the unit and very small buttons on the remote. If you can deal with this, the unit is A++ in its' price range. I would definitely puchase it again and have recommended it to friends. The difficulty is finding a seller."
5,Best book on untaxation!,"This book is what shattered my ignorance about a dozen subjects (money, taxes, law, politics, etc.) and I would highly recommend it even if untaxation is not an option for you. It's now back in print, and I ordered a recent copy from a distributor of Javelin Press (website under their name). Amazon should have it again real soon. Get this book, and the rest of his, especially Hologram of Liberty."
2,"Good for the spirit, but that's it","I have researched the Constitutional side of taxation for several years now. I have dozens of Supreme Court cases, and the list goes on. There is only one person I have found to provide factual and usable information. That man is Otto Skinner. (...)If you want to stop paying income taxes, and not worry about going to jail, there is only one way to go about doing it. This is outlined in Mr. Skinner's books. I particularly recommend his book The Biggest ""Tax Loophole"" Of All. I have read many books by many other tax patriots, but Otto is the only one to cut through the BS and provide the facts. Mr. Skinner himself has not been paying income taxes for nearly two decades and has never been to court. How many other ""tax patriots"" can claim that?(...)Oh, and just for clarification, I'm not a kid. Kid's review is just a simple and quick way to say what I have to say."
5,Awesome Book!!!,This book is awesome!!! A friend told me about it and encouraged me to order it. We suspect my eight year old has asperger's. I needed a book to help me understand asperger's more. This book really lived up to its name. It has been so helpful to me. I encourage parents to order this book if you want to learn more about asperger's.
4,Review of Attwood's book on Asperger's Syndrome,"This is a well written book with plenty of information to answer all your questions. It is techinical in spots, so you may need to re-read some of the topics. This book is recommended by therapists too in understanding this condition."
2,a good reference book,"Definitely thorough, but very dry to read. I will more likely use it as an encyclopedia, rather than read cover to cover."
4,"Yes, generally agree with every other review.","This is a very thorough, indeed 'complete' guide to Asperger's Syndrome. What is somewhat surprising to me, is how close it came in publishing to the DSM 5 [CORRECT, it is no longer a roman numeral!], and this 'Syndrome' now falls UNDER 299.00 ""Autistic Disorder,"" rather than lie outside of the spectrum. I think that the author perhaps was ahead of game--likely adding a great deal to the revised edition of the DSM. I just thought I should point this out, so as to somewhat 'update' those whom were not aware...This is not to say this book is out of date, however. I was simply surprised to see it was still #2 in most categories! WELL DONE! I'll keep this short as the other reviews do a splendid job in overviewing this well written and informed guide."
5,THE Best Book on Asperger Syndrome,Tony Attwood is a recognized leader in this field. The book is set up in an easily readable and searchable format. His writing style is detailed and intelligent while easily readable. Everyone touched by Autism Spectrum should have a copy.
4,technical,"A little more technical than I exspected, but still understanderable and very comprehensive. Good for those with asperges and their family and friends and coworkers."
3,Asperger's Syndrome,The book was not as helpful as I thought it would be. It was not specific enough to be helpful in making a diagnosis.
4,book review,I haven't finished reading this book but so far so good and everything was fine with the delivery and quality of the book.
1,Crashes my Kindle EVERY TIME!,"I would love to review Attwood's works completely, but the sample version crashes my new Kindle Fire every time I open it! Definitely don't want to purchase the full version if it causes me problems! Could a tech please fix/update???"
5,Very comprehensive book,"Purchased this book for my daughter who has a son with Asperperger's Syndrome. Although I have not read it word for word, it appears to have sound information."
5,Help with understanding,"I am so grateful for this book, it has been the description I needed to understand my son. He is 16 and was recently diagnosed with Aspergers. I have now come to understand the boy I have raised for 16 years without knowing the real him or how he thought. Thanks Tony"
5,Long Live Arthur and Guinevere!,"This is a must-have for those who enjoy the legends of Arthur and Guinevere. This book contains a female perspective and gives insight to the relationship between Guinevere's cousin and later rival, Elaine. This book will shed light on how Guinevere became one of the most adored and cherished as well as hated queens. McKenzie explores the ever-so-complex relationship between Lancelot and Guinevere notwithstanding the relationship between her and Arthur. This book presents a magical legend that will no doubt last forever."
1,Kaput!,"Another cheaply made, quickly edited, and poorly designed book. This book was much too rushed out into publication, more time should have been put into it...there was a slight potential for a great read...but it went Kaput!"
1,Isn't worth the time,"Yeah, the Guinevere point of view was different, but I passed throught this book idly, it kept dragging on and on; surprised I didn't doze off in the middle.I like these feminism books, where the females point of view is taken instead of the usual male ( Try THE FORESTWIFE by THERESA TOMLINSON, taken from Maid Marian's point of view instead of Robin Hoods. I found The Forestwife much more enjoyable. the foreign words and old English dialect, it felt like I was in their age and time, unlike this book)."
1,The Child Queen is Horrible!!!!!!,"I can not believe how such a trash could be published! An editor would have helped cut out all the giddy and silly actions and slutty reasonings this book-if you'd call it that- produces. Female teenagers who talk on the phone all day, paint their fingernails every week, and constantly fix their hair will even find this half as entertaining as THE MIST OF THE AVALONS.What a horrible reproduction of THE MIST OF THE AVALONS, it's depressing."
2,mildly entertaining,"The book was somewhat entertaining, but the story was not told particularly well. Guinevere, Lancelot and Arthur seem to be the personification of ideal people in a Medieval European setting. They do not come alive. The characters seem buffeted by fate with very little will of their own. Their complete perfection in the face of other's complete cruelty create a story not tragic, but pathetic. If it is a good tale of Arthur you seek, try Marion Zimmer Bradley or T.H. White."
5,"Guinevere and King Author, need I say more?","One of the best books I've read in a long time. McKenzie's combination of good context as well as plot kept my attention for the entire time I read it. After reading, I understood what the queen went through, her most diffucult peril being that her love stolen by her child-hood friend. The mix of a love story, adventure, and almost fantasy touched my weak spot for good books. I read it again, and again, and again.."
5,The Best Aurthurian Book I've Ever Read!,"An amazing book! The tale of Guenivere written from her point of view is very real and heartfelt. I love how 3-D she seems (a real person, not some snobby wanna be Queen). All the characters are very real, the book holds a personal value, the characters come alive. Finally a book that makes sense of Guenivere and Lancelot's love for one another, it's not evil -- but good."
4,So entrancing that 60 minutes on treadmill went by too fast,"Wonderful tale of Guinevere. Couldn't put the book down, but needed it for ""treadmilling"". Time went by too fast and I wanted more!!!"
1,"Eh, I'm not into romance or sappy stuff in books","This was a pretty decent book to read when it started off, just that towards the middle things started getting crazily predictable that the story was ruined. There was no fun or excitement that I would usually expect from a King Arthur book."
1,B O R I N G,"This is such a dull-in-the-doldrums book. There was nothing stylish or lyrical about the authors story. The words are so terribly American English, a bad thing if you're going to write about rulers of England, especially from such a long time ago. The Guinevere thing was unusual, for the good you can say. But it could have been written better."
1,oh please!!!,THE CHILD QUEEN HAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST OVERRATED FICTIONS I HAVE EVER COME ACROSS. An average book on the average dumb-headed female of the chivalry age. There are much more entertaining novels out there for teens with female point of views. THE FORESTWIFE by theresa tomlinson (as someone mentioned before) and also THE SONG OF MAGDALENE by DOnna Jo Napoli. BOth are touching fictions
2,Read Child Queen if it's your last resort,"A typical Arthurian Satir. Nothing much to say, everyone know the story of Arthur and his cheating wife, Guinevere. The only thing that made this book stand out from other Arthur books is that it was his unforgiving wife Guinevere telling the story. The Child Queen isn't really a book worth reading, but it's cheap. So get Child Queen if you're on a tight budget- if you aren't, I suggest THE FORESTWIFE by THERESA TOMLINSON (lots of childhood hate turned into love), ZEL by DONNA JO NAPOLI (rupenzel, with a beautiful twist, such a gorgeous book to read)."
2,okay,"The Child Queen is by far the first book that I have come across that I can't decide what category it belongs in. This isn't the TRUE fantasy type of reading most fantasy readers would enjoy. There wasn't the highly anticipated war or the round table. Many of the key elements that have been in the King Arthur tales have been left out of this novel, a big mistake. If some light research was done, the writer could have added very much needed details in that would have had readers think, "" Hey, this is a pretty well-rounded novel."" There was the occasional romance, but Child Queen was more of an emphasis on the love between Lancelot and Guinevere, not King Arthur."
2,disapointed...should have chose another book,"From all the rave reviews, I decided to buy this corny looking book to see what all the screaming was about...then became deeply disapointed. The High Queen lacks many elements of a good book. She had no character at all. Whatever Guinevere did, you couldn't tell her personality, how she was as a person, if she was sweet or rude. The only voice I could hear in my head, were the quoted lines which she spoke, and those failed to move me also."
1,SO American English,"This is such a dull-in-the-doldrums book. There was nothing stylish or lyrical about the authors story. The words are so terribly American English, a bad thing if you're going to write about rulers of England, especially from such a long time ago. The Guinevere thing was unusual, for the good you can say. But it could have been written better."
2,Started off pretty well,"This was a pretty decent book to read when it started off, just that towards the middle things started getting crazily predictable that the story was ruined. There was no fun or excitement that I would usually expect from a King Arthur book."
4,The Child Queen is a spectacular and impressive work of art!,"The Child Queen has a magnetic quality about it that draws the reader right through to the last page. It's tragic and inspiring tale is woven well, and brings the reader into the realm of King Arthur and Queen Guinevere, spinning a web of intrigue and mystery about it. A dreamlike quality is always evident in the magnificent tale of Ancient Britain."
5,Guinevere's Point of View,"I love this book. When read with the sequel, The High Queen, a whole new view of Arthurian legend is provided. It is a wonderful book! If you like Arthurian legend, this is a beautifully woven tale full of the romance in other books. At the same time, the alternative view is a new way to look at the story."
5,"Not perfect, but definitely worth a read!","I read both the Child Queen (and its sequel, the High Queen) a few years ago, and I loved them both. Although it has its flaws, I think that anyone who likes a good love story with clearly defined 'good guys' and 'bad guys' (who are NOT stereotypical or completely flat) will enjoy this novel for its well-conceived story. I've read the more objective versions of Arthurian legends, and this is an interesting take on how things might really have transpired. If you start it with an open mind, you'll be entertained."
2,"A okay book, not the best though","A very stereotypical if not okay book. If you want to read this amateur writer's writing, don't even bother reading the sequel."
4,Angela Metzger's Review,The book arrived on time & was in good shape! I am very pleased with my purchase
4,Great Value,"Nice ultra light rod from shimano and you can't beat the price. If they would have offered a 6' UL rod I would have gotten that one but the 5'6"" worked out just fine. The arctic grayling didn't seem to mind and they were a blast to catch on this rod."
5,great,Itams were all fantastic all with a great price and great Quality . It was a great experance buying these Itams
1,very poor rod,"I prchased this rod for light ocean fishing. The thrid time I used it I had a 4 pound porgie on the line and the pole snapped in half. I have NEVER seen a pole break in my life and I was shocked. It just snapped. Now I am having and EXTREMELY difficult time getting ANY satisfaction from Shimano snd the seeler from Amazon. The seller told me flat out in an email that they don't want to know me. Tamistuff is the seller, so beware if you do any business with tamistuff. I am also having a very difficult time with Shimano, I am almost considering NOT doing any buying of ANY Shimano products, if this is the way they handle problems.Shimano will not answer the phones nor do they respond to emails. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this pole. A cheap piece of crap."
4,good cheap product,"inexpensive rod , but works well for the surf. Good casting distance but strong enough to real in keeper size striped bass"
2,Poor shipping,The rod was shipped in two pieces an the lower shaft and the rod tip was sticking out of the box about 4 inches with no protection at all. Only an idiot would ship the rod this way. I will never purchase again from this company. You see that I am only a number and my account means nothing to them. I am still waiting for a replacement. Maybey I should not hold my breath.
5,Boyfriend loves it,"I bought this for my boyfriend-- he really likes it. Not really much else to say about it, really. :)"
1,"Broke in under 2 weeks, DO NOT BUY!","The rod lasted me under 2 week (5'6 shimano pole). This is the worst fishing pole I have ever purchased in my life, it is not worth the cheap price. I did not catch the rod tip on any window and took care of it. This product is cheap for a reason."
5,shimano spinning rod,"Hey for the money this is a great purchase. I have used it twice and I like it alot, matter of fact I like it better than my other rods. In other words my new favorite rod. Got one for my son as well."
5,Welaka Mike,Outstanding rod for the price. Selected the MH for some 60 year old Ocean City reels. they worked perfectly. Have since put Zebco 733 PL reels on the rods and they work great also. A very good buy.
4,Inexpensive Rod,"I needed a replacement for a lost rod that I use to troll for trout and Kokanee. This one fits the bill. This product arrived much quicker than was promised. I have only used it once, but it seemed to do the job for which I purchased it."
2,don't rely on it,"I bought this as a second pole, as I broke it by simply pulling drag out with maybe 7lbs of drag set on the reel it snapped in half. Maybe ok for a cheap second pole in the bottom of the boat, but don't count on it. Time will tell when I try out the warranted pole number 2 to see if it indeed is a piece of #2."
5,So far pleased,I haven't had the opportunity to test the product yet. At this time I am very pleased with the Item and plan on using it alot in the near future.
1,One trip rod.,I got 8' MH rod. The rod broke in 2 places on my first trip and the fish was gone. I don't recommend it. One star is too much for this product.
3,"Very extensive, but contact information may be incorrect.","This book offers a great variety of information on internships both in the U.S. and abroad. It also profiles former interns now turned famous. However, I have not been able to make much use of it yet. I tried calling one of the internship contact numbers listed to find out I was phoning a private residence; I tried e-mailing another contact and it too was incorrect. It seems the folks at Princeton Review have not put much effort into updating their information yearly. So, use it for the information, but beware that you may have to do research on your own to find actual updated information on the internships."
4,One extremely bright light!,"I have to say that this light is extreme, it's so bright that it lights up the entire block when I turn it on!! The only bad thing about it is the extremely loooooooooong charging time, it has to charge 18 hours for only 30 minutes of use! Over all it's a very good light if you don't mind the charging time, I gave it 4 stars because of the charging time."
2,Won't hold a charge,"Nice bright light, but takes forever to charge, and after about a week, the batteries lose their charge. And you are not supposed to leave it plugged in all the time, so when you want the light, you first need to charge it for 12 hours!!! Not very convenient."
1,vector,"after using infrequently for 6 months the switch broke , rendering the light useless. Have not been able to track the company down for a replacement."
2,Bright but not long enough......,"The brightness of this spotlight is almost equal to that of these new cars with the LED headlights.It is bright! Unfortunately though, the longevity of each charge in between use is quite disappointing. Seems like it has to be recharged after each use and the longevity drops with each use. Overall, I'd say the short charge time is not worth it's brightness."
1,Poor product!,"Does not hold charge, and will not recharge.Company phone number does not work!Three of these all performed the same way."
1,Slow and crappy,"I purchased the X4530 about 3 months ago and have been sorry every since. It is not only sloooooow but the print quality is mediocre at best. When set for the best print quality it takes about 1 minute or more for a page to print. I did call the Lexmark help line but since I can't speak Farsi and they can't speak English I recieved no help from ""Steve"". My recommendation is to not only not buy this machine but stay away from Lexmark altogether."
5,Oozes quality,"This watch feels great in hand. It is light, feels tough, and the band is thick and feels like it will last. The watch is all black and is understated, but the shape and the contrasting rivets give it just enough style to make a great match for modern urban fashion. I live in NYC and this is a great fit for the professional but relaxed business style us city slickers are so obsessed with."
5,Delicious,"I collect cookbooks and the AMA Family Cookbook is one I use all the time. My first cookbook became so tattered from use that I had to order a second one. The recipes are easy to follow, delicious, and healthy. My family loves everything I prepare from this cookbook! I recommend it highly."
1,"Runny, no lather","Got a sample of this from Neiman Marcus and took it to the gym. It's so runny, you have to use a ton to feel like you're covering your hair. Even then it doesn't lather so you don't know for sure that your hair is getting clean. Some dripped into my eye and stung terribly. I wouldn't use this shampoo if given a free lifetime supply. Terrible product."
5,Excellent Muti-Purpose Shampoo,"A dermatologist recommended this product for use on my daughter's hair after she was diagnosed with eczema. It really helped with her dry scalp and was an excellent conditioner/detangler. My daughter has gotten older and no longer has the dry scalp issue, but I continue to purchase it for my husband. He loves it because he says it makes his hair feel soft."
3,Just passed,I used the shampoo and the restructuring mask and both of them helped me to make my hair feel little smooth.But its on the pricey side.. Will try a different shampoo in Phyto the next time
2,"moisturizers, but doesn't last long","I found this shampoo to be less thick than Phytonectar and just doesn't add the same amount of moisture. Also, my hair needed more of the shampoo to actually wash my hair, thus the bottle did not last long (less than a month)."
2,Morrison denies the Apostles observed the Sabbath,"Morrison has an agenda set forth in his book that neither the apostles, including Paul or Christians personally observed the Sabbath or Sunday. Morrison only believes Jesus and the Jews did at that time period.To me this is incredible, seeing that the apostles ALL were natural Jews from birth.I would like to ask Mr Morrison when did Jesus ever instruct his 12 apostles to abandon the Sabbath altogether and only go into the synagogues to witness the good news of Jesus? When? Also Morrison states that there were no Christians living then who observed the Sabbath day? Mr Morrison, did you forget about Lydia? Mr Morrison's whole purpose in his book is to say no day of the week is really important for Christians to observe at all. This book is just terrible scriptural apologetics"
5,This book is one of the best Crow stories since the original,"This story has a great, in depth plot. As you keep on reading the book, you discover more and more powers of The Crow you wouldn't know they had. If you like Poe, you'd really like this book because it has a lot to do with Edgar A. Poe. All in all, I am very pleased with this book."
3,The worst Crow book i've ever read,"I have read many crow theme books and i didn't enjoy this one. Maybe i just have high standards...but it was way too predictable, and could of been written alot better. Consider the potential! Also way too clichy"
3,I did'nt really enjoy it that much...,"I thought the book was a little short. The author doesn't really develope his story. He seems more interested to kill off the ""villains"" as quickly as possible. I must admit that i liked the idea of torturing his victims as the poem describes. Butto tell you the truth , i wasn't really sure who the bad guy really was. Blessing seemed more of the evil one than Marquette. The book did'nt make that much sense and he only reason i went through with it was the poems in the beginning of each chapter. Well that's my opinion anyway..."
1,"FOR THE FIRST NEW CROW NOVEL, VERY POOR....","Upon reading this book again(my first review back in 2000 and btw..thats my mother's ID..my ID is Deaderman)., I find myself with a dislike for the story now. I applaud the originality of linking the crow with Edgar Allen Poe. I would say that i dislike the story for the simple fact of the Batlimore Goths and the seemingly forced love of Amy and William Blessing. I would not recommend this book to a new crow fan wanting to get into these. Most fans would say that the bad guys in CoA were poorly written and just plain crappy. Well, these guys are far worse. Makes you want to get the story over with just to get away from these poorly executed characters. I would very much agree with all of these negative reviews and in fact join them. Now, onto reading the Lazarus Heart.."
4,Like your revenge kicked up a notch?,"First time reader (I've seen the movies) of The Crow series, and I'm certainly glad I picked this as my first book. I've now started collecting some of the others as well. I'm that hooked. For me, this was like The Count of Monte Cristo meets Edgar Allan Poe. I thoroughly enjoyed the Poe references and how the revenge theme was woven into the story line. Talk about your avenging angel! More sinister than Monte Cristo, though. I'd love to see another Crow movie come out soon. You'll be sorry if you haven't read this one yet or, like me, are new to the genre and aren't sure where to start. Start with this one.The graphic novels are cool as well and are easy reads. Great art work. They help flesh out The Crow in my mind."
2,"Although extremely well written, Quoth the Crow lacks spirit","'Quoth the Crow' was a very well written book. It follows all the pre-ordained ideas of the original, but with one flaw...it doesn't contain the right formulas to create an empathy with the reader. I wasn't torn or upset or even concerned for our newest Crow incarnation at all during the course of the book. Sadly, I found it dry and slightly corny in areas. Edgar Allen Poe was an interesting idea but again was somewhat lacking in the big picture. If you are an avid Crow fan such as I, You will undoubtedly buy and read all things 'Crow' and will not regret shelling out the money for the books. You will not be disappointed in this book, simply because it is a well written story and will undoubtedly whet your appetite for other installments of this wonderfully dark series."
4,it was brilliant i really enjoyed it !,I really enjoyed it it was a great read and i let a few of my mates read it and they thought the same. The film of the crow is my absolute favourite and in my opinion this is an unusual follow up in that it is almost as good as the origional. Read on with it its great fun and just a really good read you will see what i mean when you finish it!
3,Dilligently Written Throughout Most of the Book,"I myself am a huge Crow fan. I found this book to be well written artistically, yet it did not have such a good storyline. The concept of the crow completely fell apart throughout the pages of this book. My high expectations of this book completely declined towards the conclusion of the book. The ending could have been much better judging by how the book was intriugely written in the beginning. Its not worth reading, especially in comparision to the amazingly captivating original Crow graphic novel by J.O. Barr."
1,They fell off three times today.,"These panniers fall off easily if they are not weighed down with at least five pounds of stuff. The hooks (they are not clips) that connect them to the top of the rack are small and at least one comes off nearly every time I ride. Sometimes when that happens, the pannier wears against my spokes. After less than a year of use, small holes are appearing due to that wear. The bungee cords that hook onto the lower part of the rack are not sufficiently taut to keep the bags in place, so I looped them around one of the plastic loops that it travels through before hooking them onto the lower part of the rack.All told, you're better off buying a nicer and more expensive pair of panniers that have a decent and reliable way of hooking the panniers onto the bike. These are worth even less than what you pay for them. I will probably buy some new panniers after using these for less than one year."
4,Pretty good carrier bags! Love them.,"I purchased these bags with the intent to carry my laptop, headset, a book or two, and plenty of other smaller items to work and back. It has plenty of space for what I take to work (and I take carry about 30lbs to work every day).They attach pretty easily to the bike rack and are fairly quick to remove.The one thing that made me give a 4 star was that I had to throw on an extra bungee chord to help hold it down on the rack. The chords that came attached to the bags are a little weak and thought maybe if I were to hit a large bump they would come loose.Other than that, they work perfectly and have not had any problems with them to date. Hope this helps."
2,It's going back to the store tomorrow :(,"A few reason not to get it . My biggest complain being not every hotwheels will work on it. In fact I tested all the hotwheels my son has and none works except the one come with the set. 2 el cheapo small cars worked but couldn't stand the abuse of the Turbo Booster .Other than that the track is very high speed, and it fails about 1 out of 10 times even with the stock car. It hasn't shoot the car out that can harm my son but mother and grandma is very worried. Also the hand of the gorilla suppose to hit a lever and hummer the car into a car cage. But when I set the set on carpet the gorilla misses the lever all the time. It works better on kitchen floor but the manual says make sure to set it on ""carpet"". I guess it's going back to the store tomorrow.I would had kept it if most hotwheels will run on the track. I bought it from Toy R Us and their display used just every hotwheels there is. I guess they never test it and it's very miss leading."
2,Not worth it.,"My sons got this for Christmas last year, and they played with it for about 2 weeks, then gave up. I put it together exactly according to the instructions, and the first time we attempted to put the car through the track it flew off and hit my son. He wasn't hurt, just startled...but still. After tweaking the track for a very long time, we eventually got it to work. My kids were frustrated that only a handful of their very large Hotwheels collection would actually work with this toy. The toy's track soon got out of the very precise alignment it apparently has to be in, and the cars started flying off again. The gorilla's fist stopped hitting the lever in the right place, so the cage portion didn't work right. My kids must have decided that the aggravation wasn't worth it, so now its sitting in their room, unplayed with for months. Now, I'm realizing that its going to be a big pain to dissasemble and store."
1,Not so great,"We bought this toy for our [...] old because the display was so cute in the store. I should have known something wasn't right when the display was not working. It talked but the cars didn't go. We got it home and set-up went okay (we used the animated instructions online), but realized the toy wasn't what we thought when we tried to use it. The car kept hitting the ""lane switcher"" and flying off the track. That problem could only be fixed temporarily. Another problem was that if the track wasn't set up precisely, the car would fly off the track. After a few laps it would move a little and have to be re-adjusted. The gorilla kept having to be re-adjusted as well... we never got it to do exactly what it was supposed to. I was under the impression that it said stuff as well (from the store display), but it never did. Anyway, after lots of annoyance with it, we decided to take it back and and we bought some legos instead."
2,Poorly designed,"My 5 yr old son thinks this toy is great, but after only 30 minutes of play the force of the Gorilla falling over backward had pulled the base apart to a point where the Gorilla only works now if I sit beside it and hold the base together while my son plays with it. He also got a set of strait Hotwheels track for Xmas like I had when I was a kid. He has alot more fun with that: putting books under it to make jumps; seeing how many cars can go down the track at once, etc... More entertaining, more imaginative, more durable. Sometimes simpler is better!"
2,"If it worked, it would be GREAT","This was No. 1 on the christmas list and it has proven to be a disappointment. He still wants it to work and we fiddled with it for days... trying the suggestions here to no avail. We can't get the switch on the back of the gorilla to even move to automatic. It will go back today, but my 5 year old still says if we could have one that works he would like to replace it. It is a hard decision to take this toy back because he really loves the ""concept."""
5,AWESOME,We bought this for our three year old son for X-mas. Assembly not hard you just need patience. He has not stopped playing with it and it is still working just fine. He has sat for hours.
1,Terrible - Do Not Buy!!,The grandparents bought this for our four year old for Christmas. They live out of town so he got it early yesterday. It broke twice before we could put it together. These race tracks with the flimsy plastic peices are not worth the money.
3,Would be great if it actually works!?!,"""Santa"" brought this for my son this Christmas. As the rest of the reviews say the Gorilla's arm does not work. It will not come down and hit the trap door. It will only work if my son does it himself. Putting it together wasn't that difficult. I was also disappointed that they fail to tell you on the box that only certain hot wheel cars will work with this track. I was going to exchange this track for another but after reading the other reviews, I will probably just get something different."
2,What a racket Mattel has going!!!,"It's an overpriced piece of crap, as most Hot Wheels products seem to be, but my 5-year-old begged relentlessly for it for months. Santa brought it yesterday, and it was fairly easy to set up, but you really have to fiddle with it to get it to work properly. I still can't get the gorilla's fist to smash down on the lever, but most of the rest of it seems to work. My son LOVES it.We bought last year's contraption, Slimecano, after months of similar begging. It was a huge disappointment, and we ended up returning it to Toys-R-Us after the couple of weeks it took to convince my son that it was junk. Even he eventually agreed and we took it back and exchanged it for something else.Still think it's way overpriced for a plastic pile of crap, but Hot Wheels seems to be able to convince the kids they need to ask for it for Christmas. What a racket they have going!"
3,Gorilla attack,New out of box. Easy to assembleOne problem that I will look at again and againThe spring or clamp that fastens the gorilla down does not fasten all the way spring makes it stay slightly up 2 cm just enough that the arm does not operate the trap door.
1,Too loud.,"My son does really like this toy and once we got it working right it was fun, but it's way too loud when the cars get launched. My son is very sensitive to loud sounds and holds his ears every time he plays with this, but he does enjoy watching it and playing with it. It could be a bit more sturdy than it is, but we don't really have a stable playing area. Plus, this thing is huge, why does it have to be so big and cumbersome? It takes up a lot of room in my sons bedroom. He has only played with it on for about a week, but he now just plays with it manually and likes to have the gorilla eat the cars and put them in the cage. I know he's played with it, but not with the launch function. Overall, don't expect too much out of this toy."
5,A multi-voiced and situated portrayal of local Hawai'i today,"Gary Pak is an awesome writer, who captures a range of political and cultural positions in Hawa'i with care and tact: he offers, in this collection as in his recent novel with U of Hawai'i Press, a multi-voiced and situated portrayal of local Hawai'i today in all its complexity and struggle. Highly recommended for ordinary readers, college and high school courses, but maybe not for tourists looking for exotica on the beach."
1,This Book Stunk,"I wasn't feeling the storyline and altough it may have been atrue story, this book put me to sleep. It was boooooooring!!"
5,Applause from a parent and teacher,"The Storyteller's Beads explores a timely theme: how do we make connections with people from different religious, ethnic and geographical backgrounds? Read this book, and the magic of distant lands will come alive for you. Hardships and suffering are transcended by the grace of friendship. The author lived in Ethiopia as a girl and writes with exquisite detail and nuance. A must-read for ages 9-12 in this difficult moment of history. Read aloud to aware 8 year olds. Also a marvelous testament to the strength of a young woman who is physically blind but morally gifted."
3,Good But Not Great,"The Storyteller's Beads was an okay book. This book had a cool plot, it was about two girls from different religions escaping from Ethiopia. The girls were separated from their family when Ethiopian soldiers caught them escaping. There were also several bad things about this book; such as, the book switched from girl to girl every other chapter before they meet each other. Another thing I did not like about this book is the way there was no suspense. Every time that you didn't know what was going to happen, the suspense would stop and you would know what the truth was in a couple sentences. For example, when the girls were trying to escape Ethiopia they started to get shot at by Ethiopian bandits and a couple sentences after I read this, I knew what the result of the shooting was. All in all I give this book a 3 out of 5 star rating."
5,Excellent,"I have always wondered how Nico had performed her brilliant songs from Camera Obscura. As I listen to this album, I notice that once again Nico exceeded my expectations:-) I heard that in the Japanese version of this album ""Win a Few"" was added as the bonus track. Unfortunately it is not in here. I wish that someday they will add it. This is one of the best live recordings of Nico. I really have difficulty in finding words to describe it. Nico proved that she could experiment with rock, goth and jazz while maintaining her unique sound. Together with ""Fata Morgana"" which is Nico's last concert, Live in Tokyo sums up the talent of this rock goddess."
3,Interesting book perhaps not the definitive translation,"I prefer the Patterson and Robinson translation to this one. It has more scholarily research behind it, and it just feels less forced and more appropriate. That may not sound like a good reason to trust that translation more, but with items like the Gospel of Thomas one must rely on their gut to decided which translation rings more true as there are so many interpretations that vary so dramatically.Unfortunately there is too much awkward text and strange meanings in this text for me to fully trust it.I have to believe that as scholars rigorously immerse themselves in the Coptic language clearer translations of the true intention of the text will be revealed. I believe the Patterson & Robinson translation to be the closest text to realizing that eventuality."
4,elements of 4 patterns,"notes from LP site:Four different rhythms are detailed, Samba, 6/8, Calypso and Inang (Malaysia). See and hear how each musician's part interacts with the others. Continuing in the tradition of 'The Rhythmic Construction of a Salsa Tune,' this DVD explores the various rhythmic elements involved in World Music"
1,LASTED 20 MINUTES!,"Bought this grinder for replacing windows in my home. I assumed that the grinder would be powerfull enough to grind down aluminum. WRONG!It lasted about 20 minutes before burning out. I called Black & Decker and they told me I would have to take it to a Black & Decker Repair Center to have it replaced. Fortunately,living in Southern California, there was a repair center within 10 miles. When I took it back they didn't have any in stock so they would have to send me a new one, which would take 7-10 working days. I did receive another grinder within a week, however when the grinder burnt out, I had no choice but to purchase another grinder to finish replacing the window"
3,Good collection of cover songs,"Despite another reviewer's claim that this should have more INXS music on it, please note that the name INXS does not appear anywhere on the album. For that, go buy one of their best of albums featuring Michael Hutchence!This is a collection of the songs performed on the first week of the show, plus bonus songs by Jordis Unga and MiG Ayesa. However, note that these songs were RE-recorded especially for this album. The original songs could not be more than 2 minutes long due to TV time constraints, and these are all 3-4 minutes. And no, they don't seem to be long versions that were edited for TV. Compare the TV version to this and you'll note that these are a different recording, redone after a regular taping, several weeks into the show. In fact, it was so late into the show, that you'll notice a huge difference between ""Baba O'Riley"" when Jordis was on fire, and the version on this album when her fire had already started to simmer a bit."
2,Disappointing,Disappointed in the selection of songs. Are they really trying to sell this? It doesn't seem like it with the song selection!
2,Audience Chosen CD,"I think if they had voters tell who they wanted to go on they should have waited until the end of the competition and asked the viewing audience what songs they would have wanted most on a CD, put together the top 12 songs and made the CD after the competition was over."
3,meh..,"I would categorize this cd in one word: meh. With one exception: Jordis Unga's version of ""The Man Who Sold The World."" It is an excellent version of a classic song. I wish they had included her version of ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door"" or ""Imagine"" which were also amazing. She is a talented artist whom I hope we see more of."
2,Where's Pretty Vegas?,"All the good songs aren't on there... Creep, Money, and the good originals Trees and Pretty Vegas"
1,HERO to ZERO,"I was once a HUGE Inxs fan. But now they have signed on that schmuck ""JD"" I pledge to never listen again. I just sold my INXS disks and deleted it all off my Ipod.What a very stupid mistake on the remaining band members part.I predict a dim future and toast those talented folks that ""missed this boat"" ala Marty and Jordis."
3,rockstar,"I was a bit disappointed with this CD didn't feel the best songs were included would have preferred the songs off the DVD which I feel is a much better buy, but this sufficed OK for listening to in the car"
2,What a disappointment!,"I am a true fan of the ""rock star"" shows that have aired so far. However, i really should have listened to the reviews on this one! This cd is terrible! The only good songs on it are the 2 from jordis, teenage wasteland and the man that sold the world. I found the rest of the cd literally ""Painful"" to listen to! Most of the tracks i couldnt even listen to the whole song! It was definately not a good selection of songs for the musicians to record and in my opinion it did not do them any justice. Looking forward to hearing what rockstar supernova cd will have to offer...hopefully something better than this!"
1,Lame,"I would assume they would want strong performances be the attraction of the CD not all the lame ones. I only liked the bonus tracks (Jordis and Mig) but I can download those from MSN. Whoever was the marketing genius behind this idea should get fired. Marty singing one of his early song selection?? What about the Pink Floyd one, or Radiohead or Nirvana. Ty's encore was on Bob Marley not Cult of Personality...I say skip the CD, download the music that you like from MSN."
3,good CD,"This is a good CD if you're a fan of the show. It is the complete recording of the first episode of Rockstar: INXS (way back when Dana was cut) with two extra songs from later in the show. On that first episode most of these songs were not shown in their entirety, so it's nice to hear them finally. I find the energy of the album to be a bit disapointing, however. They've lowered the crowd noise to almost non-existent levels (mostly between songs) so it takes some of the punch out of the live performances."
2,huge disappointment,"As most have said pass on this cd and go to msn and download all the songs worth having. There are a few bright spots on this cd(Jordis and Marty) but not enough to purchase it. Go to msn find the songs from Mary, Jordis, & Susie and make your own cd that will kick ass-- not this piece of crap."
2,Prefered Song Selection Would Be ...,"As others have already written, the song selection is extremely disappointing. If I was to put together a highlight CD, the first 8 songs would be:Baby One More Time - Marty CaseyPretty Vegas - JD FortuneBohemian Rhapsody - Suzy McNeilWish You Were Here - Marty CaseyBaby I Love Your Way - Mig AyesaTrees - Marty CaseyPretty Vegas (Encore) - JD FortuneTrees (Acoustic Encore) - Marty Casey"
1,Why not the good stuff??,"From what I have read, and the selections that are on this CD (With the exception of Jordis ""The Man who would save the World"" and MiG's ""Baby I Love Your Way"") I would have thought they might pick the best performance from each singer. I waited impatiently for the performance show each week. I had hoped that they would put out some type of compilation CD, but I will not be buying this one. I will pick and choose my fav perfomances from each fantastic singer on my own."
1,SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Disappointed,My son watched week after week. He was so excited when the first CD was released. When it arrived he was so upset that all the good artist and songs were left off. It was the allful first week songs. What a ripoff
2,Very Sad...,"I was initially very excited about this CD release until I saw the song selections/singers and sampled a few of them. What a great disappointment this thing is. I really liked a lot of these people on the show, but they all have done much better material than what is listed here. Aside from the stellar ""Man Who Sold The World"" by Jordis, there isn't much here I'm interested in. If the song selections had been different and/or better, this would have been a must-have. As is, I will pass."
1,F'IN PISSED!!!,I JUST SPENT 20$ ON THIS CRAP!!!! AND TO TOP THAT OFF IT'S THE LIVE CRAP FROM THE FIRST SHOW!!!!I'M SO PISSED.... I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE STUDIO RECORDED VERSIONS.. WTV... NOT WORTH 20$!!!!... DON'T BUY IT.....
1,POOR CHOICE OF SONGS,"Come on, they could have done so much better than this. I was looking forward to the best songs, not the worst. The last one by Mig was good and that was it. I thought the show was ridiculous anyway because the voters clearly liked Mig and Marty better, yet J.D. the baby won. Thats ok, he can go down the toilet with an outdated band and the others can launch real careers."
3,"If you liked the show, you'll like this product","While this collection of songs may not represent the very best from each contestant, it certainly has several great offerings. If you liked the show and enjoy the rock, you'll be satisfied with this CD."
3,An excess of good songs.,"I'll assume people know this, but in case you don't, these are all songs sung by people competing to become the new singer for the band INXS. We get at least one track from each singer, and two from Jordis and Mig. This is mostly a good group of classic songs covered, with a few from recent times as well. None of these performances really improve on the originals of course, but most here do a decent job. My biggest question is what's the point of this? As of today the competition is down to three, and all but one of these people will be a distant memory real soon. And another thing, WHERE ARE THE INXS SONGS? This is not an audition for The Rolling Stones or Nirvana, know what I mean? Unless ""Rock Star"" just happens to be your favorite reality show of all time, get the best of INXS instead."
3,A NIGHT AT THE MAYAN,"MOST OF THE PERFORMANCES ARE WORTH LISTENING TO. I WISH THEY WOULD HAVE PICKED THE PERFORMER'S BEST PERFORMANCE AND GROUPED THEM ONTO AN ALBUM INSTEAD OF PICKING ONE PERFORMANCE NIGHT. THE 2 BONUS TRACKS ARE EXCELLENT. OVERALL, IT IS WORTH BUYING."
3,RockStar INXS CD with all songs the performers sang,I would love to have a CD with all of the songs the performers sang on Rockstar INXS. All of them!
3,"Good start could be better...plus some ""goodies""","INXS is looking for a new lead singer, so let's have a 'reality"" show based on this. So 15 ""rockers"" come to L.A. and start ""Rock Star:INXS"". This is basically the first/pilot episode performances from the 15 ""rockers"", that wasn't available for downloading. The highlights of the first 15 tracks are Jordis (""Baba O'Riley"" kicked off the performances) and Ty (""Cult Of Personalilty""). Included are 2 ""bonus"" tracks. Jordis' cover of David Bowie/Nirvana's ""The Man Who Sold the World"" and Mig's cover of Peter Frampton's ""Baby, I Love Your Way"" both earned ""encores"" during the series, and were (at one time) the top downloaded tracks on the show's web site.Has a regular viewer of ""Rock Star: INXS"", I hope they put out more ""highlight"" CD's from these rockers (only one gets to be the lead singer) of both the ""classic"" rock tunes and the INXS covers."
5,Rockstar INXS: A Night At The Mayan,I loved this item. I liked Heather Luttrell's Burning down the house the best. She was the bomb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I hope you other kids liked her too!!
3,First broadcast on CD,"Everyone forgets that this CD was produced about half-way through the series, and thus the songs ""Trees"" and ""Pretty Vegas"" weren't included. They only had full versions of the songs taht were on the first episode, as all of the other shows had truncated versions to fit into the show's alloted time."
