5,ALIEN VERSUS PREDATOR EXTINCTION,"Great game Alien vs Predator Extinction, when I first thought about purchasing this product I was not sure if it would be compatable with the XBOX 360at first I was hesitant. I went ahead and bought the product and turned out great have been playing it every day since the day I received it. Product was in excellent condition looks like new. Would trust Amazon products to anyone having second thoughts about purchasing products from this website. Great quality products."
2,Not much of a game.,"The three campaigns in this real-time strategy game are set on similar-looking maps, the objectives (even the discover-able optional ones) are predictable, the actual strategies are basic, the AI mediocre (pathfinding in particular is a significant issue), there's very little in the way of presentational touches (not even cinematics at the end of each campaign) and the play, while outwardly difficult at medium level, becomes far easier once you discover the upgrades ... at which time your over-powered crew can take on pretty much all comers. I enjoyed the Alien campaign best -- there's something corruptly fun about running a hive -- but the elaborate alien-creation process aside, it's cut from the same cheap cloth as its Marine and Predator counterparts. Try Goblin Commander instead. :)"
2,Not what I was expecting....,"Fans of the classic AVP, and AVP 2 put crafted by Rebellion Studios and Sierra respectively will be scratching their heads when they pop this game into their xbox. This is not a FPS, or a FP squad based game. Why they would create an AVP game so completely divorced from the interactive experience found on the PC versions that developed a global audience is baffling."
2,Just ok,"A straight forward book. Helpful hints and itemized to do list. I recommend further reading of other books: the Widow's Financial survival guide by Nancy Dunnan is very detailed , well written book; if needing help with probate and estate , read The Executor's handbook by Theodure E. Hughes- you'll have deeper understanding of the probate process and rule."
1,Bizarre and boring,I bought this without listening to any cuts. Mistake. Though the cuts couldn't possibly show the breadth of zigs and zags of nothingness. I have the weirdest collection of music and rarely do I dislike something. This takes the cake. It is like listening to a psychotic on downers--nothing makes sense.
5,The Making of a Legend: Gone with the Wind,My mother took me to see this movie when I was six. I have been fascinated by it ever since. I loved seeing how the movie was made.
3,"This is a book review, product was great.","Book was received in great shape. Just as expected. Shipping great. Author left out a lot of details about disaster. Alabama Air National Guard lost 4 airmen in the raid. Castro kept one on ice for 18 years to show other countries there was Americans in the invasion, which President Kennedy and government from then on denied. CIA would not go get the body because it would admit guilt. Daughter of dead airman begged Castro for her fathers body and he gave it back to her. I was on the burying detail that was sworn to keep it secrete. In 2005 it was declassified but not highly published."
3,100% wrong,its 100% wrong in its conclusions! yes the details are interesting but the real problem was the stupidity that we could do it and appear to be uninvolved. it failed at the ehite house and the styate department! the boots on the had no chance!
2,Not recommended,"Materials are bad quality, users manual is useless, had to configure everytime I used it because it kept on switching to 800 x 600. TV actors kept on showing bluish until I realized that it happened when NTSC & PAL was set to automatic, so I also had to keep on swiching to NTSC.I would not purschase again. I would also go for unit that supports 1440 x 900 since 1280 x 1024 is now getting obsolete."
1,"This product does not even do, what the specification says.","I am terribly dissapointed with this product. The specification says ""3 PiP Screen Size"". Not true! There is only one fixed (far to large) Pip size. ""PiP Transparent Mode"". Not true! The product only has non-transparent mode. If you are looking for another product that does the job, buy ""Avermedia TVBox 9"". True quality picture and has the functionality it claims."
1,Very cheap product; expensive for what you are getting.,"If you want to watch TV on your monitor, choose a different product. This one produces a terrible picture, the remote is cheap and does not work well with RF, and the instruction bookly are poorly translated from the original language.Also, do not buy products from TigerDirect unless you want open-box items."
3,Sabrent TV Tuner review,"At first, I was confused with how to work it. It did come with instructions, but are hard to follow... not clear & easy to read at all! However, after setting it up with my panel monitor and fiddling with it for about an hour, I did get it to work. Like the above posts, the color is somewhat off... but my panel monitor is also older. If I had bought this for a newer monitor, I would not be too happy. So over all, it works for the most part... but not the best quality and has very poor instruction manual."
2,Not so good,"The production on this was pretty bad. The angle shots of where she is placing her fingers was horrible. You could barely see where she was placing her left hand. The shots were from the side instead over on top where most instructional DVD's show the hands. She would give you little song examples but there was no notation of any kind of what she was playing. It was pretty bland in my opinion. Concept of what she is trying to teach is solid but yet not that instructional. I understand what she is saying, it just needed a more modern approach and additional material. After listening to her talk for about 10 minutes, I was ready to fall face forward into a deep sleep."
1,If you advanced skilled this would be useable,If would have been much better with overhead shots of keyboard. Would have helped if we know what she was playing. I needed an DVD of chord voicing and would have appreciated if we had been presented with more information.This is not for first timers. I guess its money that could have been better off else where.
1,Item not as pictured,"The item sent was ""New formulation"" with plastic jar and cap. Seller should change picture, unless the intenet is to mislead consumers into buying over priced items. I could have purchased what I received at any store for under $5. I wanted the classic jar for a reason and was willing to pay extra for that. I think what seller is doing is called bait and s....."
4,mini cupcake pan,"This is a great pan to make mini cupcakes in. It's so easy to use my Granddaughter, who is 7, made cupcakes all by herself, put it in the tins with liners and then filled the liners with cake batter. They came out looking and tasting wonderful."
1,shockingly disappointing given the brand name!,"This PEELED (yes, peeled) before i even used it ONCE!! Terrible waste of $ albeit it's pretty cheap, but if I were you, I'd get something more expensive that will last! I am not sure what possessed me to get this as opposed to something more reputable, as I'm pretty exacting of my cookware."
2,Mini Muffin an,The cups were smaller than I wanted but this would be a great purchase for someone looking to make mini cupcakes.
1,AMS,"Cheap, came with no paper work on how to put it togther. It was bent because it had no packing inside to keep it safe. I bought two and of eight dishes four were crushed. The middle is not safe for small birds. (two of my baby finches got crushed and died.)We found two more at another store that was the same thing, that was so much nicer and the same price."
3,Cage Review,"This cage is o.k. for finches, but not sturdy enough for anything larger then a finch. It is easy to clean, and was very easy to assemble. I use the divider, and have 2 finches on each side. I would not consider putting more then 4 birds in this cage."
3,Perfect size for canaries to lovebirds,"These stackable cages are great. Easily put together, they fit very well in the 3 tier stand. But the large door in front is the only place to put the breeder boxes, so it was necessary to use a full cage for one pair of lovebirds, or give up access to the inside of the cage. A little inconvenient. And to attach the box, I had to remove the door, also a little inconvenient. Will know more when I remove the box and try to reattach the door. The cup size is perfect for the 1 to 5 birds I have in each 1/2 cage. Easy to access, and easy to clean. A good investment for my fledgling bird business."
2,Didn't receive correct item,"I ordered the Aviary Cage 30x18x18 with the divider, in order to quarantine a new parakeet with my old one. It was also supposed to have four cups. I received the 30x18x18 cage, but WITHOUT the divider. There isn't even a place for a divider, and it only came with 2 cups and 2 available doors for cups. It's not missing parts, it's just the wrong cage entirely. I was skeptical to buy after reading some of the reviews of the company, but it seemed like the perfect cage so I went ahead and ordered it anyway. The new parakeet is already here, so I can't return it and get a new one. This one will have to do."
1,poooooooooor aggies!,Worthless drivel. That school is more like a cult than a university. A waste of time. Don't waste your cash.
2,skymama,"This book has some good general information on nutrition and such, but lacks in simplicity when it comes to the actual recipes. They are a bit ""too"" gourmet, and call for items that you would normally not have on hand. I'll tell you what; I am on my second pregnancy right now and I am too hungry to take the time and enegy to cook these recipes!"
1,Not the cookbook for me and maybe you as well !!!!,"I wish there had been a way to preview the entire book before buying. This book does not offer any life changing, new info on how to eat when pregnant. And if you are like the majority of pregnant women that get nauseated at the thought of certain foods, the recipes are way out there in terms of scent, flavor and texture. But you are the courageous type, then this book is for you. Happy cooking."
3,"Good info, but too gourmet","This book has a good informational section at the beginning, but the recipes are a little too gourmet for me The average person will probably agree. While the dishes were very tastey, they were too much of a change from the flavors I'm used to, and there was a little too much involved in cooking them. Too much trouble while pregnant unless you're already used to gourmet cooking."
1,Alcohol?,"This is a British book and it says a little alcohol is ok while pregnant. They may be right, but it's still kind of weird. It kind of turned me off to the book. I recommend the What to Eating Well when You're Expecting book.What to Expect: Eating Well When You're Expecting"
2,How old is this stuff?,The product is awesome.It's condition is unacceptable.Most of it is in a solid clump!We had to cut it open and crush it in a zip-lock bag to make it usable at all!Skip buying it here and get it in fresher condition from a grocer!
5,ethereal...,"i was surfing around iTunes a few weeks ago, and i come upon the cover art 4 this album and dcided 2 check it out... i will 4ever be grateful that i did!!! this is like nothing i've ever heard be4. the ethereal feel of the whole thing has just the right amount of sultry tunes and ""whispery"" vocals without being dpressing. like many others that have reviewed this album, ""slippin"" is my favorite from the whole album. i get completely lost in the closing vocal ad libs (""aahhs"") with an underlying violin-ish fill that couldn't have been done any other way... check this album out now!"
5,"""Strange Flower"" is More than Beautiful","The sultry and seductive voice behind Blue 6's ""Sweeter Love"" has reached out to release this, her debut solo album, ""Strange Flower"". Beautiful and different at the same time, Aya will bring you to a halt with her rhythms and her beautiful voice. At once urgent and coy, Aya is an artist, talented both musically and lyrically, who creates music that is not only gorgeous, but intelligent and full of meaning. With songs that groove like ""Slippin'"" and ""Curtain Call"", Aya will have you salivating from one to fourteen. Worth more than just the money, Aya deserves a long stay within your musical selections and taste!"
5,Great,She has to Make another cd i hope love her style I am a big fan of the neo soul music i no she is part of what people call naked music sounds neo soul to me new to her Man i really love this cd
5,Champ Chill,"Best chill out CD I've heard in a while. Mostly downtempo and atmospheric but remarkably unformulatic for music that exists as a formula. Aya's voice is most pleasnt and largely unprocessed. There is one song where she sounds nasal, but this CD is put together so carefully that I'm assuming it was done intentionally. There are two songs that are truly outstanding- Nobody Knows Me and Looking for the Sun - and a bunch of other good songs like I'll Never Give In, Do What You Want and Uptown. Even the short filler songs are interesting and do a good job acting as sonic connectors."
4,Etheral Pleasure,"Never heard of her until I happened to crossed this page, heard some samples and immediately bought the cd. I have to say it is pretty good. Very calming, relaxing, and etheral. Its a very chill out cd. My only complaint is that some of the songs can tend to sound the same. Aya is a good vocalist, but not as good as Sade (someone said she was better than Sade). But realistically they don't even have the same type of sound to their voices so the comparison is really unwarrented. Anyway, good cd. I recommend it if you want to chill at home and just relax."
1,Aya . . .ain't feelin' it,"Samples of this CD suggested a nice mix of neo-grooves with fresh, unique vocals. What I heard were uninteresting and predictable tracks, weak and (at times) unintelligible vocals. Hoping to add Aya to my stable of neo-soul vocalist, e.g., Dexter, Larrieux, Badu, Scott, I found this CD better suited for the ""used"" sale CDs. Another reviewer said this would make great ambient music, and that makes sense; I could put this on and forget all about it."
2,SLIGHTLY DISSAPPOINTED,"When I first heard Aya's beautiful voice on the radio singing Nobody knows me, I thought this cd was a must have! No actuallyI could have waited and burned just the single from someone else."
4,Flower Has Bloomed Well,"I'm new to the genre mainly listening to hip hop and R&B. This album production wise, is fantastic. Full of smooth melodies and warm yet full base. Her voice is what i love the most not very powerful, but very soft and elegant. The album is beautiful on the ears I'm now a naked music fan."
1,Not a good choice,"Poorly written, low quality diagrams, and says nothing new about aerodynamics. The author changes the names of concepts and theories that science has known about for some time and then thinks that he has discovered something new. I sent mine back."
2,2.5 Stars at Best,"The beginner might get something from this, but it is a poorly-produced rehash of the basics. There are better beginner's DVDs, like the ones from Vince Van Patten.Just my two pence..."
1,This book is not useful for reference nor is it funny.,"The back of the book advertises this as a choice for the ""Humor"" shelf. But it isn't funny. The only joke the authors make is to take the scholar saints (such as St. Alphonse Ligouri or St. Augustine) and make fun of their analysis of sexual ethics. It is mean-spirited and misrepresentative. To take one example, St. John Chrysostom is characterized as having nothing good to say about women, sex, and marriage. But reading his homilies on family life (available from St. Vladamir's Press) shows that he was a marvelous champion of family and marriage. The tone is almost insulting: the implied joke is, ""aren't these folks' views pretty ridiculous?"" In reality, saints whose lives and work I know have more to say about love and responsibility than all the self-help books available.There are lots of other saints' books to buy that have good information without the constant bedroom fascination that this book displays. Keep searching."
5,Once I read it I knew I had to get my own copy.,"I was a R C + many points here struck a chord. I have two other martologies, both of a more serious vein though one is aimed at children. Neither compare well. Kelly's look at Aquinas, eg, a church authority on women despite limited + rather negative experience is justly admonitory.Sure, Kelly and Rogers show up the glaringly obvious faults in the church's pet paragons. But they also have their favourites eg, Don John Bosco, Francis of Assisi, Philip Neri. It may not suit the conservative, but I think the vein is entirely appropriate and all in all, an excellent work of which both authors should be very proud."
1,Warning! Consider the source when looking at this book.,"I bought this book as a gift and after reading a bit, wished I had not! The ""wit"" some reviews have mentioned is in very poor taste. I was shocked when I read a mention of St. Joseph that included an old ""joke"" about him that had no place in a book of Saints. I felt confused and betrayed. So I did what I should have done before, I looked at the authors. On the cover (the back I think) was the usual blurb about who wrote the book. I was dismayed to find I'd bought a Saints book by 2 Professed EX-Catholics! If you're looking for something Catholic, consider the source. Ever since that day, I always have.May I suggest Bob & Penny Lord's books? Now those are Catholic!!"
3,"Funny, but not.","Amusing in spots, not so much in others. I just don't find it amusing to refer to St. John Vianney as ""stupid to a remarkable degree"" or as a ""pious simpleton"". I find it ugly and a little embarrassing for the bitter ex-Catholic I imagine the authors to be. Also, facts are shaky."
2,dogg chit,"bottom line, these two fools need to step they game up, production is waterdown, and boring. people in cali really dont feel this no more. album is average, this album is not worth buying rather your a fan or not, its nothing your missing"
1,Horrible,"im from california and dis has to be the weakest dog pound cd ever made. it was to close to the production of their last one Cali iz Active, which was a good album. the beats are horrible, lyrics are lackluster. i was very disappointed do not buy"
1,Baby McDonald by Baby Einstein,I run a day care in my home. The ages are from 14 months to 3-1/2. I have several other Baby Einstein dvd's and they have always loved them. This one however has not held any interest whatsoever for any of them. I found it particularly boring myself without all the visual and audio stimulation of the others. Stick to the basics and use the toys. I would not recommend this one at all.
5,5 month old LOVES this video!,My mother bought this video for my 5 month old and he LOVES it! The sounds and constant changing visuals keep his attention even though this video is rated for 9 mo and up. When my son hears the music start he gets so excited that it is about to begin. I highly recommend this video!
3,Can't relate,"I bought this for my 20 month boy and he walked away after 10 munites of the show. I think he couldn't relate to the farm and the muppets. He absolutely loves the Baby's First Impression videos and want to watch them over and over again. They have more lively music and they show toddlers playing in the playground, counting and dancing. Basically, they use things that he could relate to. He would call out the things he regconizes and apply the new concept he learns like color or sound to them."
4,Happy Mom - nice,My daughter and I picked this DVD. She loves the animals and the farm. We've promised to take her to one now. Baby Einstein is high on entertainment.Though I think Brainy Baby(they a have a lot of videos) and Galloping Minds Videos (they have 2 'Alpahbets' and 'Shapes and Colors') are higher on education.
5,One of the best of the Baby Einstein series,"This video in the Baby Einstein series is one of the best. The video is focused and thematic throughout. It alternates between education and humorous puppet acts, wonderful scenes of rural places and lively children's music. My nine month old is spellbound and my seven year old loves it too!"
1,Lawsuit goldmine,"The American Academy of Pediatrics shows that watching videos as a toddler may lead to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD, also called ADD in UK) in later life. TV watching ""rewires"" an infant's brain, In contrast to the way real life unfolds and is experienced by young children, the pace of any TV is greatly sped up. Research appears in the April 2004 issue of Pediatrics. Quick scene shifts of video images become ""normal,"" to a baby ""when in fact, it's decidedly not normal or natural."" Exposing a baby's developing brain to videos may overstimulate it, causing permanent changes in developing neural pathways. The damage shows up at age 7 when children have difficulty paying attention in school."
2,Not suitable for 3 month old,DVD had to be cleaned as it was skipping. But it was too advanced for a 3 month old. She was not interested even though her name is McDonald.
4,One of my son's favorites,"My 16-month-old son really enjoys this one (almost as much as he likes Neptune and Galileo). He always giggles at the messy piggies in the mud puddle, and when they do ""celebrating the harvest"" he actually gets up and dances with the kids and puppets. I like that they show all different kinds of people farming/herding in many countries, not just traditional American farming of guys in overalls plowing huge fields with giant tractors...although my kid gets pretty pumped up when the tractors are on the screen. The footage of a plane flying over what looks like a tulip farm is amazing."
4,a great look at the farm scene,"my son is almost four and he loved the baby einstein videos, though he is starting to outgrow them now. however, he will still watch them periodically. the ones like this, about the farm and animals and harvest, etc is great if you are not accostomed to farms in your area, which he is not. it really is a window to the larger world. i would recommend this to everyone with kids 4 and under. try a variety of the einstein videos. there are many sets out along the same lines as these that show worldly objects kids recognize, and present them in a way that makes it interesting to watch for young viewers in this age group. einstein is the original series of videos. i own many of them, and recommend them to everyone"
4,great!,"my 20-month-old is obsessed with animals, so we decided to try this one out. needless to say, she definitely liked it. i do think it's a possibility that younger ones might not follow it as well because it does require a bit more concentration than the others, but it does a great job introducing the life on the farm, and even the littlest ones will like the animals and the puppet shows. i think this is one they won't outgrow anytime soon. anyway, my daughter is really at the stage now where she can comprehend a good bit, and loves her fisher price little people farm, so with her this dvd was a big hit. i think her absolute favorite though is the numbers nursery dvd. :) overall, a wonderful way to teach little ones about the farm life and animals!"
5,Sooo Cute!!,This DVD is sooo cute! My son loves the real-life farm scenes in the DVD. He also really loves the pig in the mud! Well worth the money. Your baby will love it!
3,It's OK,"I got the 2004 version of this and it was just sort of blah. The hand puppets were definitely cute, but it didn't hold my or my baby's attention very well. On the other hand, when I put in Baby Noah she will sit there and watch almost the entire thing. I got these mainly just so I could have some time to do the dishes, etc when she is feeling fussy, so they aren't played every day, but I know there is no way Baby MacDonald would hold her attention if she was fussy. If you don't have any of these DVDs and are looking for one to start on, I'd recommend Baby Noah. It's almost 40 minutes, has a TON of different animals and the sock puppets even make my husband and I laugh."
5,The quality is outstanding,"Our 15 month old grandson doesn't watch TV except for maybe 15-20 min here or there... so this is wonderful as they tell us to encourage imagination. When you don't live near any farm animals it's hard to give them toys resembling them as they just look like lumps of plastic. Certainly you can't expect them to use imagination. We can see what a difference this makes. He especially loves the horses. He bops along to Old McDonald and sings ee, I, ee, I, ooooh- he just loves it. I can see him growing with this as he starts to understand harvesting and where food comes from. It's delightful, wonderful music and color. The ony small downside is the rather long wait to run through the intro each time (copywrite warnings, etc), if someone figures a way to shorten that, once you'd seen it, that would be wonderful."
5,One of the best Baby Einsteins,"My kids love this DVD. It's got great farm footage, and it goes from busy to sleepy music. Good for bedtime."
5,My Daughter Loves This Video,"I don't know if boys like it better like some of the reviews mentioned, but my daughter loves it! She love all animals especially horses and cows. She also loves the puppets. When each animal comes on the screen, we repeat the animal name in english and spanish. She is 17 months old and can already say doggie, horse and cow in both languages. It was a very good buy for us!"
5,EXCELLENT!,THIS VIDEO ENTHRALLS MY 2 MONTH OLD TWIN NIECES AND KEEPS MY 2 YR OLD IN LAUGHTER AND HER ATTENTION OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN!
5,Bravo Baby Einstein,"We are avid watchers of all Baby Einstein media. My son is now 15 months and we watch from our collection on a daily basis. I am truly amazed at how Baby McDonald and all the videos hold my child's attention. He has watched from 3 months on up. He dances and does motions. He is learning so much from the animals, sounds, colors, and especially the music. Each video gets better and better. I have seen them all a hundred times but still like them myself. Keep them coming Julie Clark!"
4,"Price is Right, Size is Not","An excellent buy, no doubt, but I was expecting it to be a little bigger. People with large heads might have a problem. Everything else is good enough to make it the only pair of binoculars an amateur would need."
2,Not at his best,"I love Pasqua's music. Unfortunately, this is not one of his better outings. ""Badlands"" and ""Live at Rocco"" are far superior."
5,Easy and understandable reading.,"This is a great little book, it is easy reading and very understandable. I would recommend this book to all who seek to understand the important of African consciousness."
1,It's all Personal Taste,I was given this CD and can't even sell it at a used record store. No one seems to want it.
1,Wha??,"Which planet are you guys from? This music sucks! This guy just sings one line lyrics over crappy synth, and you guys not only like Scooter but give it 5 STARS?!?! I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!"
1,Sticky,"I don't like this stuff. Smells good though. I gave the jar away to a kid who likes to spike his hair. If you don't want spikes, don't buy this."
4,Great for Frizz and Fly-Aways,"My hairdresser has been using this stuff for years and every time I would ask her what it is, but then not buy it. I'm so glad I finally did. I live in Florida so I'm constantly battling humidity. My hair is prone to frizz anyway, so it makes my fly-aways that much worse. I use it for a sleek ponytail look in the summer, and any time I want to look a little more polished when I style my hair. I was concerned about the price and how fast I would go through it, but a little goes a long way and I'm sure this will last me a LONG time. It also smells amazing."
5,Saturday just got even better,"I did like NCAA 2003 with its freaky-deep Dynasty mode and all, but nothing prepared me for what NCAA 2004 had in store. Basically, it's NCAA 2003 with a faceliftPros: 1. Its NCAA 2003... With a facelift!2. EA Sports teams up with Sports Illustrated to make this a better game (the best moment in Sports Gaming since Sega meets ESPN!)3. More Teams, Plays, and Mascots4. The Best Dynasty Mode around just got even deeper5. NCAA 101 will help newbies to the game by teaching then the basics (Offense, Defense, The Option, etc.)Cons: 1. The game has some bugs in it (one is where the game stalls for some random reason, but dont worry, this only happens for about 5 seconds then it returns to normal. Another is the typical EA bug where it sometimes does that ""this disk cannot be read"" thing)2. Loading times are a travestyFinal Verdict: Id say buy it, the bugs dont really ruin the game's image at all and with the SI contract, this game is a cant miss"
5,create your own team,"best feature is the ability to creat your own team, talking staduim, colors, mascot, location, everything. Was able to re create my division 2 school I played for that they didn't feel important enough to have pre loaded in game"
5,its a really great USB flash drive !,"Since buying it, I always have a usb flash memory (""disk-on-key"") handy - I put it in my wallet when I received it (of course, after trying it and amazed of the easy connection, even to my IBM Thinkpad that had a problematic USB port..., as it connects both ways (!!) and it is great to be able to just plug it in without wondering which is the ""right"" side up..), and since its there by my visa and amex cards, it is always safe, and always with me (of course, if my wallet will be lost, than... but then my least problem is the data - but my other info cards, important notes I have and my bank cards...).It was great having it ready for file transfer in the least expected place I've been and had a presentation of something I needed (no plans for it beforehand so I couldn't tell I'll need a media for that) - which helped me a lot afterwards.Generally speaking, I recommend this slim credit-card sized USB flash drive, as it really is quality and helpful."
5,Great Picture hanging hooks.,"Length:: 1:52 MinsThe best, most stable way to hang a picture with a screw and anchor."
4,"A great compliation, but it actually has 20 tracks","This is a great ""sampler"" album with one track each from avariety of Q.D.K. albums. Be warned that a wide range of music is covered here.Note also that the amazon.com track listing has been wrong for at least a year and they refuse to correct it. (I have made several efforts to contact them.) There are only 20 tracks on this CD, not 38. (amazon.com has erroneously mixed in most of the album titles as separate track names.)You can go to the German amazon.de site to see the correct 20 track listing as well as hear samples of the tracks."
1,Not recommendable !!!!!!,I ordered this product about 3weeks ago and was excited because I have was excited to finally be able to do my own eyebrows sadly to know is that it was NOT WHAT I EXPECTED... this is a totalWaste of money ....
1,worthless,"Not worth the $5 bucks I invested, did not work at all, waste of moneybasically spent the money on stickers"
4,If you can't make it to the salon,"OK, so I have problem eye brows. I don't have a unibrow, but they do need to be tamed. Every couple of months I make it to my local salon and let the lady with the wax do her thing and I look great. In between visits though I can get a little fuzzy and these strips do the trick. They are pre-cut in a nice generic arch shape and very easy to use. Make sure that your skin is clean and dry - I usually go over the area with a cotton ball and some skin toner. Use these in a well-lit room, by a sunny window is best. Warm the strips in your hand a bit before you apply them - it helps. Press them on your skin and rub in the direction the hair grows. Pull your skin back a bit and then pull the strip off quickly. If it really hurts (which it won't) you can use a little ice to numb the area.Put some light moisturizer on afterwards and you are ready to face the world."
3,Ok product,"I purchased these hoping that they would be the perfect solution to tweezing, sadly they were not. They do remove the hair if you wash your face first and remove the oils, but the shape is all wrong and to try to cut the strips is just not for me. I would purchase these again but they are equivalent to using wax and there is still a lot of tweezing to shape your eyebrows."
1,Removed No Hair!!,It was a flimsy see-through strips with this adhesive on back. More of a sticker. Did nothing for me. Didn't even removed one hair. Disappointed.
4,"Wax strips for eye brows do work well. BUT, only",when the eye brown wax strips are placed and pulled properly. The sticker like strips are to be simply taken out from the stricker base and placed correctly on the eye brows to shape them.
4,Worth watching,"Format-The author is giving a speech at an entrepreneur's convention. He is a fairly good speaker. Moderatly entertaining and communicates his point(s) clearly. Run time about 70 minutes. The preamble is kinda long but it IS a live speech so he's just trying to warm up the audience.Essentially, he advocates awarness of what words you use to express yourself and their affect, not only on who you are talking to, but also on your own mood. He presents examples of saying things 'the usual way' and then saying the same thing a better way."
3,Not very practical,"This clip takes a long time to load. Also, the gas valve is inset in the bottom of the clip, making it difficult to get a proper connection when filling."
1,Don't bother with this article,"Short list of generic, anecdotal time management tips - not worth $5.95. 20% of the 1313 ""word count"" is spent pitching other services and listing common time management books."
4,"Worth a look, but...","I have no doubt that Harmon's very clear and correct in his own mind on what is essential to a professional golf swing and what is not, but in this book he spends too many pages presenting his impressive credentials and not enough explaining swing technique. He does a good (though minimal) job explaining the Norman/Woods-style full swing. I found the short game and putting comments too brief to be very helpful. More like a few tips followed by advice to ""practice"". This book was written when Tiger was just turning pro so most of the ""how I fixed the pro's swing"" comments are Greg Norman centric. Interesting and unique stuff there, though. In summary, a nice supplement to your golf library, but not a core book IMO."
2,Wheel ok but center cap is junk,The wheel is great and looks good. However the center cap it not so good. The emblem is crooked and now after a short time is fading rapidly to a whitish color.
1,Avoid so-called guide from a non-trader,"Those who know how to trade, trade.Those who know how to write, write.With a few exceptions, those who don't know how to trade, write.There are thousands books about technical analysis or trading in general. This is one I would avoid.The author obviously had not done enough research on the successful traders he wrote about in the book.Take, Stanley Kroll, which had been a great success (he passed away in 1999) and had written a few insightful books you can find at Amazon. The author stated that he did not used moving averages. But in Kroll's book, he used moving averages extensively for trend trading and keep it simple."
4,Interesting balance of the use of charting,"Blair provided a balanced perspective of the use of charting. In each case, he provided real examples where the interpretation of the charting method yield the expected result, and also those that didn't.Blair advised a fair skeptism of using charting tools independently of other investment tools.A broad overview of the common tools is provided, and this book is recommended for anyone who's getting into charting for the first time. He provided a concise description of each and its use, and also recommended a list of readings for those who would like to get into more details. Personally, this was a quick jump-start for me.This book is easy reading."
3,Good Price,"Good price; the product is fine, however, it took quite a while to arrive at my home, which was unexpected"
3,"An ok book, by an ok photographer",Russel's documentary work of this great conductor is only ok. His large format panoramic photography is much more interesting. Unfortunately these photographs have yet to be published in book form.
5,The Perfect Tapestry,"Elliott Light's CHAIN THINKING was the perfect tapestry of mystery, drama, animal rights, and the law. The story begins with a 'big bang' and doesn't stop running from there. I was drawn to his protagonist Shep Harrington, the reluctant hero/detective/lawyer, through whose eyes and voice we are reminded of the injustices our society imposes upon chimpanzees and other animals for our own selfish purposes. Mr. Light is able to convey a strong message without being preachy. I also enjoyed Shep's dry sense of humor. I promise you'll pick up the book and finish it in one read."
1,Dissappointed,"We were sold the teachers edition without our knowledge. Good way for a student to get kicked out of class. They did this without us knowing and put tape over the top of the edge of the book that said ""Teachers Edition"". Shame on someone. I had to buy another book at the school bookstore and pay full price. Did not discover this right away so now I am probably too late to return this book I bought my daughter. Disappointed in Amazon for this happening."
1,This is NOT The Prodigy!!!! Crap rap!!!,"this is defintely not The Prodigy; the heavy electronic beats and power that you may wish it is. This is some tired wannabee rap crap, don't waste your $$. This is going on E-Bay right now. This is the worst piece of deception ever, how dare they try to pass this off as The Prodigy!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,You guys leaving the 1-star reviews are confused...,"This is the rapper Prodigy who is one half of the gangster rap group Mobb Deep from Queensbridge, New York City (the other half of the group being Havoc). This is not the British electronic music group Prodigy."
5,Now thats gangsta !!!!,This Cd is 5 stars all the way. I can see where people would tottally hate this Cd though you gotta be a hardcore rap fan and Mobb deep fan if you are than this ones for you if not buy Kaye West or something.
1,....,"When i heard there was a new album i was really excited being a huge Prodigy fan...BUT after hearing it...Words i wish to use to describe this album cannot be used so i'll say this...""Expensive Poop-A-Scoopa"" I am really disappointed in this CD and the idiots that like it."
1,"this is sad, to me at least...","im a huge prodigy fan, dating back to their begining days and this is the first ever disappointing album by them. i love rock, industrial, old school rock, tecno, trance, alternative and progressive type of music the most, but this album is nothing like that, its a hip hop / r & b / rap album. im am so dissapointend. if your expecting somewhat of what youve got to know of prodigy, youll see none here. this album of theirs is a completley backwards version of them. it might get new fans, it may loose them tons and tons, who knows? last but not least, i definatley DO NOT recommend this album."
1,A pathetically amateur gangster-rap demo reel at best <- NOT Prodigy at worst.,"I found this CD fairly annoying to listen to and certainly upsetting by calling themselves ""Prodigy""... THIS IS NOT PRODIGY. I don't know who mixed up trademarks or whatever it takes to retain an artists' name but this is not even a good rap album. Just some fairly sad, rank, armature mix tracks with some gangster-thug talking about how he's all tough... What a detriment to society he is. I don't usually review CD's here (and I've purchased a lot over the years) but this CD definitely deserves some negative reviews more than any I've ever listened to. It if were possible to rate this CD with negative stars I would. It's not worth the plastic it's printed on. The fact that someone thought this was worthy of public consumption is an embarrassment to the human race."
1,What the heck is this?,"When i heard Prodigy i thought it meant the techno band Prodigy not the rapper Prodigy. Whatever it is this is terrible. The title track Stuck on You is about as bad as it comes. I am really sick of the chipmunk voices in rap music. This isn't even good based on mainstream rap standards. He sounds like The Game but this music isn't catchy at all. If your as sick as i am of hearing rappers talk about how cool they are and they run the town check out Roots Manuva, Del the Funky Homosapien, Dangerdoom, or De la Soul or any of the Gorillaz songs thier associated with. Bus Driver is pretty good too. And The Alchemist sucks."
5,Really worth the money!,"These binoculars are nice! Clear image, good feel, light weight and quality construction. They have BK-7 prisms fully coated optics and rubber coating. They are made in China but their construction is better than the twice the price Meades made in Japan. They have the same not so bad case and cheap neck strap but more than make up for that in image quality. A definate 5 stars considering the price."
3,It's ok,"Cage is spacious and good for my 6 finches. But it was hard to put together, came with a broken feed dish (which I replaced), has a flimsy bottom making it hard to pull out bottom tray and reinsert it when cleaning, and not real sturdily built. I do like the large middle door."
1,What a crappy toaster...,"Yuck. Toasting is inconsistent every way possible. Sometimes the bread is blackened on one end, some times it's underdone. Forget english muffins, they too get blackened before they get toasted at all. To top it all off, it has this obnoxious piercing blue light that's always on, it catches your eye from across the kitchen as subtle reminder that here sits a crappy toaster."
1,Disappointed!!!,"I never thought I would be unhappy with an Oster product. However, I have had this toaster for 2 months; and in that 2 months I have yet to get any evenly toasted slices from it. I have tried every setting with no luck. The edges get very dark or burned with the middle hardly toasted at all. Needless to say, I will be toaster shopping again. I only gave this item one star as it does look good in my kitchen."
1,Beautiful Piece of Junk,"I fell in love with the looks of this toaster. Was very proud of it, until just over year of ownership, the controls stopped working and my family had to flee out of the house to prevent smoke inhalation. The only way we could get the toaster to stop was to hold our breath and unplug it. In recent research of this toaster, I've learned that this has happened to other owners of this product. Extremely dangerous, I plan on writing to Oster to inform them of this. I don't expect any compensation, but they should be made aware this. In the event an older child is home unsupervised and making some toast, and gets distracted, the outcome could be disastrous!"
1,VERY DANGEROUS ~OSTER REPLACED IT FOR ME IMMEDIATELY!,"I fell in love with the gorgeous red metallic color, but from the first use it NEVER toasted properly! Would pop up continually after just 2-3 seconds. I had to change the setting to 7 just to get the toast to stay down and then it would burn. I contacted Oster who asked for several numbers on the toaster and also the plug. They immediately told me to discontinue use and sent me a brand new toaster... similar style and design but in Brushed Nickel finish. This toaster works perfectly. While I love the look of the red, the safety hazard is too great to use it. I suggest ANYONE who purchased this call OSTER and seek a replacement as this was obviously not just a glitch in one toaster after reading all of the reviews."
1,BROKE IN 2 WEEKS!,"Since it was Oster I trusted it, threw the packaging away and now I can't return it. Totally stopped working.Like they say.....you have to have more than just a pretty face!"
2,Not new,It was listed as new cd the conditions of the disc weren't new it was just ok and didn't come with original case only cover and cd not back cover so why list it as new? Cd is hard to find I just went along with it
2,"does NOT fit 15"" powerbook!","don't let the product name fool you--even though everything (including the packaging) says it specifically fits 15"" powerbooks, it DOESN'T. it's a fraction of an inch too small--it takes quite a bit of effort to zip the case with my laptop inside. once it's zipped, it's so stretched around the computer that it looks like it's gonna bust a seam, if not right away, it will eventually. if you have a slightly smaller laptop, this would be a nice sleeve for it--i like the neoprene and the pocket on the front. just frustrating that it doesn't fit the laptop that it's supposedly made to fit!"
2,Too superficial for someone who actually owns land,"This book is simply a collection of stories about different people and how they have managed their woodlands. There is no in-depth discussion of logging methods, and little about the economics of the business. The book seemed aimed at people who want a little hobby to go with their land."
3,I Disagree ...,"I have to completely disagree with the above review!This film may not be ""oscar"" material, but it definitely had a poetic structure to it.This film is more than just another run of the mill vampire/horror flick. It delves deeper into the true nature of a creature that, in his mind, has lived for centuries.I enjoy how this movies allows the viewer to think whether Sebastian, the main character, is truly a centuries old vampire or some deluded man who seems to be his own worst enemy.Regardless, after watching this film I found a message which we can all relate to. Don't waste your time searching for things when the true answers lie closer than we think.Sebastian spent more than a life time searching for something which lead him to stop ""living"".This movie may not be an A + movie but it does have it's merits.This movie is a prime example of indie filmmaking in which the creators used visual poetry as opposed to gore and FX to tell this story."
3,Disagree with other reviews,"Ok..There was a review here that slammed this movie because obviously, the guy expected massive special effects and major theatrics. When he makes his own movie, I most likely would slam it for kicks. This movie made him think and whoa..that was pretty difficult I guess.I agree with another review that it's no Oscar winner but not all movies are. Some are Indie for a reason. The maker wanted to tell a story and did just that. I reccomend finding someone who has it or rent it and see for yourself. Then buy it if you like it."
5,"Hard to find, but worth finding!","Among St. Etienne's best CDs is this hard-to-find gem from 1993. Chock full of melodic, atmospheric soundscapes, cool vocals, and charming (and sometimes surprising) instrumental colorings. In between tracks there are short audion clips and record samples that make this CD sort of a pop music collage, with a little bit of techno impressionism (""Avenue""), some girl-group sounds (""You're in a Bad Way""), some melacholy acoustic guitar-driven balladry (the best track, ""Hobart Paving""). Track listing : Mario's Cafe, Railway Jam, Date with Spelman, Calico, Avenue, You're in a Bad Way, Memo to Pricey, Hobart Paving, Leafhound, Clock Milk, Conchita Martinez, No Rainbows for Me, Here Come Clown Feet, Junk the Morgue, Chicken Soup, Join Our Club."
2,excessive droning,"I'm afraid this really just isn't their best work. Some individual tracks do indeed bear St. Etienne's signature grace, but together the album lacks variety and becomes a soporific hum. The inserted british dialog reminds me of ""tubthumper"" and adds nothing to the album. If you're new to St. Etienne, try ""Good humor."""
3,baseball book for little ones,Needed to learn quickly about coaching a new baseball team and this one caught my eye. Organized well and got quickly to the point. I was able to implement several strategies the first day.
2,"be very very careful- BAD editing, GREAT ideas!","I am a working chef. I used this book a LOT during culinary school to get ideas.Great! Ideas!***LOUSY*** ""editing"".As several other have warned/mentioned- I honestly wonder if the author TRIED these recipes. example- the 'drunken peach trifle' recipe measurements need to be reworked.(I also remember a nightmare with a pie recipe but can't remember which one...the results were horrific)I have had simillar experiences with other books of hers...I truly love the series (the healthy cookbook is good as well as others in the series) but I can't believe the truly horrendous editing.Be warned- take the ideas and create your own..."
1,:( THIS ISN'T LIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This doll has breasts and a Barbie doll figure....Lil is friggin' TEN on the show, not THIRTEEN like Angelica and Susie!!!!! Come on Nickelodeon, and bring back the Rugrats as babies, 'cause they were more fun as kids than dumb preteens/teens!"
5,NCAA Football is DA BOMB,"now, if u like college football than u will love this game! there are lots of different juke moves, dives, passes, etc. that u can preform! graphics are good, season mode is exciting, and there are over 50 different teams to choose from. you can customize your own teams and players, and the good thing is that you can choose how each player is dressed and how each stadium is set up! you have SOOOOOOOOOOOO much to choose from! i was just SOOOOOO amazed at how good this game was! you have to go get a copy of the game yourself right now or you wont get the pleasure of playing and owning one of the best NCAA games ever!(p.s. DONT LISTEN TO ALL OF THE HATERS!!!!!!!!!!) IM WARNING YOU!"
3,Disappointing for all the hype,"As a big football fan, I could not wait to buy this, especially after I owned Madden 2004 and learned of the draft import ability. I went against better judgment and spent the $50 on it and I am disappointed. Graphics are not as good as they make them out to be, playability isn't as smooth as Madden. There is a lot of cool stuff on the dynasty mode, but the game isn't eye candy and controls are sluggish. Decent game, but buy it used."
5,Greatest College Game Ever,"NCAA 2004 is one of the greatest football game ever created for any console. If you are looking for a hard-core video game then you should get NCAA Football 2004.Comparing it to Madden NFL 2004, this game is maybe a half a star better. The reason is because you could have rival games, bowl games and it has every major team in the NCAA.Pro's:Easy controlsGreat playsGreat graphicsAnd many more...Con's:No names? This is because it's always changing but what the h***?"
5,Once again the best football game on the market,"For three years in a row this continues to be the most enjoyable football game around. The brand of football helps (the option pitch, unorthodox defenses), but the game reeks of college atmosphere once again. The commentary continues to shine and the additions such as Greatest Games and the Sports Illustrated covers are great.I've been critical of EA for their sloppiness with the NBA, NHL and F1 series... but this game, along with the Tiger Woods series, continues to impress year after year."
5,a message to EA and others,"What a great game! it is by far the most realistic game ever made for anything.here are the only problems i have 1 the logos on the jerseys are great but there are only nike show some love for addidas ,rebok and espically russel being a football player myself i know the importance of good gloves and in create a player there is only one pair of gloves to choose from and i know that you can only have grey gloves in college but in next years version i would LOVEEEE to see the matching logos and gloves for each team its simple all you have to do is find out what the newest pair looks like from each company (and Neuman's for Russel becase you see that alot)all i ask is to give us a selection of gloves and logo's on the uni's. i give this game a 9.7 rating out of 10 that's the highest i've ever given just try to top it next year EA keep up the good work. LOVE & PEACE."
5,Get ready for BOTH joysticks!,"NCAA 2004 PS2 ""Madden Style""...the perfect warm up for Madden 2004. Get your PS2 controller ready, and YOUR joystick in the other as we're all gonna be in for one fun, messy ride!"
1,Save your money,"This video is an amateur production not worth the money. If you want to watch a home video of a trucker and self-appointed ""safety expert"" ramble on about his opinion, then this is for you."
4,great price,"this was a good value. hose was not metal, was like a regular silver hose. works will and no leaks so far."
4,Good product easy to install,"Good product, easy to install. be careful eith the fittings as they are plastic and can break easily. I had to use pipe tape to stop the leaking but that is semi normal with plumbing"
4,nice spray,"Bought this item at Sams. It does feel like cheap plastic, but, was easy to install and once I figured out how to work it- we like it! I thought the diverter knob was used at 90 degrees, I finally figured out that it had a 45 degree setting that allowed me to used both heads at the same time. My husband likes that the regular setting covers the whole body so it feels warmer. We have only had it a week, so we'll see how it holds up."
2,Low pressure!,This shower head seems to be well made but delivers frustratingly LOW water pressure. Definitely no tingle! I expected better performance at this price.
1,Sharp LC-32GD4U Aquos TV,"I bought this tv in February of 2005. Worked fine until the end of January 2006. Now the picture won't stay on and the set will not turn on regularly. This set is still supposedly under warranty and I have a ton of money in it. Sharp warranty service appears to be non-existent. I've called into Sharp, they've sent two different service shops out that did not know what to do and have not yet fixed the set. I'm going back to Sharp but I've been messing around with this for almost a month now. Missed the Superbowl, and now I've missed the Olympics.Be careful if you buy from Sharp. If your set goes bad, good luck............they don't seem to care."
5,Katherine Deauxville has written a wonderful romantic comedy,"I devoured this book with the same gusto that I would enjoy consuming some sinfully rich dessert at my favorite restaurant. This book is a delightful confection with a frothy, whipped cream layer of hilarious slapstick and a more subtle dark chocolate layer of satire. Like any rich dessert, a lot of talent and skill was used in the preparation. The author has created historically accurate characters and setting. She has written two of the funniest love scenes that this reader has ever read. So indulge yourself and read this book."
2,Just couldn't finish this...,"Based on past reviews, I began this book with great hope. Almost immediately I found an extremely childish heroine. Her man was more beast than hero. This pair was at such cross purposes and couldn't have a civil conversation, I wondered if we'd have a happily ever after a reader could believe in. From what I read, I doubted it very much."
2,NOT for BEGINNERS,"I am sorry to give this book two stars. It is probably a good book, but it is NOT for beginners, so I gave the low stars to get the attention of people who were on the fence or wondering whether it was appropriate for beginners. It is not motivating or engaging at all for real newbies. Not for people who have never cracked a book on astronomy. It is filled with the kind of details that bog down someone trying to gauge investigate interest. I share the sentiments of the other person (so far) who gave it two stars. No photographs. Nothing really basic. I highly recommend NightWatch: A Practical Guide to Viewing the Universe. It has all the things this book does not: beautiful photographs, comprehensive but understandable content, and an engaging tone.NightWatch: A Practical Guide to Viewing the Universe"
4,"Nice, but narrow","I have to agree with the others on this one: these shoes are narrow. I have fairly wide feet and a wide shoe is normally wide enough, but these ones are pretty tight, especially on my pinky toes. Also, as I just bought them, they are giving me blisters on the heels. They are a very attractive shoe, but just make sure you buy them a size wider than you normally would."
1,Very Narrow,"I normally wear medium width shoes, but ordered this in wide to try and resolve some foot pain. This shoe even in wide is VERY NARROW. So narrow in fact, I couldn't even get my foot in the shoe. It's too bad, because the shoe itself is very attractive."
1,Way too small,These shoes were way too small. Even my daughter couldn't get her feet into these shoes.
3,Difficult to get on,"I ordered size 8.5M. Had the most difficult time getting these shoes on, had to attempt at least 4 trys. Once on, shoes are very comfortable, but not something I want to go through each time I wear them. Do not order your normal size, get the widest size available, and you may also need to size up 1/2 size. With the price, may be worth trying. I am returning them."
4,I'm so glad I listened to the reviews for this shoe,"After reading all the reviews I ordered a half-size up and am very thankful. Its quite a narrow shoe but it is comfortable. I have them on right now with barefeet and I'm going to have wear very thin socks.If your feet aren't too wide and you order, at least, a half size up they're a great buy for the price.***** I need to amend my review. After one day of wear my back heel was bruised. Except for that the show fit well. I ended up returning it! Unfortunately I cannot change the amount of stars I gave it."
3,Very Narrow- not true to size,"I have narrow feet. These shoes are so narrow that I have to get the next wider width. I ordered them in black which I loved, but had to return them and now they only have brown. It is an attractive shoe- I may just get the brown."
4,Handy little book,This was a good book for anyone curious about aquatic stream insects. Pictures are great for simple identification. Obviously extremely handy for any fly tiers.
2,poor quality printing,"this is an amazing book but unfortunately the quality of printing feels cheap, like a photo copy, fonts are not very readable."
2,Note about video cropping in this version of the movie.,"For your information, this video was cropped from a full screen (4:3) version of the movie so that it has the shape of a widescreen (16:9) version. This means that the top and bottom of the movie have been cut off. Therefore, parts of the movie, including some of the credits, are missing critical video information that would have added significantly to the content of the movie had it not been cropped."
4,Another forgotten war,I had the opportunity to talk more than 50 years ago with a survivorof the Hungarian uprising - the film deals with empathy with mentrapped in tragic situations trying to do the best they can. Even Russiansoldiers are treated like human beings not monsters.I had seeen the film in Spain and think they have cut-off some scenesfrom the original film but it is still excellent.
4,Quite good,"I've waited years for this movie to come to disc and before that on VHS.Was not disappointed. Quality was good. Plenty of excellent character actors in the movie, including an almost toddler age Ron Howard.Very satisfying story line.Worth watching over and over just to enjoy the connection between Yul Brynner and Deborah Kerr. Same thing was on spectacular display in The King and I.I don't think they even make movie stars like these two anymore.Worth every cent."
3,Tools will work with compressor,"This kit is designed for a home user. The painter and the impact wrench will not work continuously, but they will work for short times then the compressor needs to build up more pressure. The other tools, nailer, cleaner, and the tire inflater work fine. This is a good price for the tools and the compressor as long as you understand the limitations."
2,You don't want this compressor is only 1.3 CFM at 90PSI,"From the Campbell Hausfeld website""8 gallon oil-lubricated air compressor with 1.3 running horsepower and 1.3 SCFM @ 90 PSI""That means the compressor in this kit, won't run any of the air tools included with this kit except the nailer."
4,Great Shoes,"I love these shoes. The construction quality is top notch. My only complaint is the sizing is weird; I wear an 11 in almost everything and needed a 10 here (width is true to size). I also thought they'd be made in USA, but my pair was from India."
4,If only the finish were a little better...,"Great shoe, nice support and cushioning. Very nice looking, draws compliments. Only complaint is they are high maintenance, require too frequent polishing, and J&M; doesn't make Dark Cherry polish. The polish that they do make seems to take several buffings to remove and has indeed wound its way onto my pant cuffs...GReat shoe, just beware that they will take a little work maintain the great look..."
4,Nice Overall,"It is redder than it is in the picture, which, to me, looks basically brown. It more closely matches the leather on the ""Tommy Hilfiger Men's 1710318 Classic Tank Roman Numeral Enamel Dial"" than it does the ""Tissot Men's Watches Couturier T035.410.16.031.00"", which it what I originally was trying to coordinate."
3,"Informative in some ways, but lacking information in others.","I'm a first time Malamute owner and I must admit that this book is generally good for knowing most facts about the breed. I thought, however, that the book lacked information on how to properly keep a Malamute in a run outdoors. I also thought strange that a longtime owner such as the author would not recommend keeping such a breed outdoors when it's clearly proven to like it better outside than indoors, especially in the winter time when houses are heated and can cause depression for the dog. Other than that, the book is rather good and the pictures are beautiful."
4,The Lost Episodes... Almost!,"Although it was nice to finally obtain the lost episodes which were edited out of the proper release order (which is what the other clips on this disc are, as I have them in the proper order on VHS from Sci-Fi Channel from Long Ago) when these features were assembled, as I HATE having one of these series that isn't COMPLETE, I'm STILL waiting for the Saturday Morning Special that started it all, which I missed somehow, and have never seen repeated anywhere else, for some unknown reason, unless that it was a full length production.Now, if I could just find my playlist, again!Hopefully the producers of ""Roughnecks"" won't let their die-hard fans down."
3,Not like other releases,"I was very surprised and disappointed to find out this DVD had only one episode and was over in say 20 minutes or so. There is some supplemental material worth watching, but only one main menu episode.The animation series is great fun and worth having every episode. But I felt cheated when after watching all the previous DVDs, this one ended so quickly.Sure hope any future DVD releases run longer."
4,Great Fun,"The whole Roughnecks series is finally available! The episodes contained on the ""Trackers"" DVD finish the set, although it should be noted that viewing them in the original broadcast order will be a bit tricky. (Those interested in doing so are advised to do a bit of Googling.)"
3,Disappointing Filler,"The Roughnecks series is, in general, a very high-quality production. Trackers is disappointing not only because the disc contains only a single new episode, but even more so because the production quality of this episode is not nearly as high as it has been for all previously released campaigns/episodes.I enjoyed watching the episode as a filler episode to fill us in on what happened in between the Klendathu and Homefront campaigns. But the animation is simply not up to standard I've come to love and expect from the Roughnecks series.I sincerely hope that, whenever Sony finally gets around to having the final episode finished and released, it will be of much higher quality than the Trackers episode. It has been a while since the Roughnecks series was first produced and aired, and with advances in computing power it is reasonable to expect the final episode to look at least as good as the episodes that have been released previously."
3,A VERY SHORT piece of a great series..,"In alot of ways, the animated Starship Troopers show was better than the movie. What is disappointing about this DVD is that it is only ONE episode from the series; not an entire campaign like all the other DVD collections. Why? Who knows, buy the othe Troopers DVDs so you get your money's worth."
3,Adult-age animation film,"I am NOT into animation films. I did like the original ""Starship Troopers"" with Casper Van Dien, thats's why I thought this was a follow-up series, not realizing they were animated. OOPS! my fault. Watch if you like cartoons!"
1,exploits the success of the others,"Unfortunately this disk is just one short espisode between the ones previously covered by other roughneck DVDs. Unless ofcourse my DVD is faulty and is only showing the first episode of many (I hope this is the case, and its not just producer greed).The specials show additional footage that was not shown previously.If the company that is producing this fabulous story is testing the waters before producing another episode. Ummm. Just do it!Cheap work ups like this turn off fans, not inspire them.I wanna buy more Roughneck episodes. One more cheap shot like this and you can kiss all my future $$$$ goodbye."
2,Rip-off,This is not another episode in this series - it's a commercial with 20 minutes of tease for the next in the series.
1,ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzz.,"First let me say that I love to see anything about space and I was excited to see a dvd devoted to views of the earth from the space shuttle. Too bad it didn't live up to my expectations. I was hoping for more of the type of views like the shots that you see on the cover of the dvd. What I got was mainly shots looking straight down at the ground so that much of the time you have a screen filled up with varying shades of brown with occasional views of a lake, river, or ocean. A few brief moments were good like the views of hurricanes from space but the good moments were very brief and very few in number. It just isn't that interesting.I was also hoping for some night shots because all the lights shining up from the big cities would look kinda cool. Unfortunately there are NO night shots.One good idea they had was that there are 4 different sound tracks to listen to with the video. That's the only good thing I can say about the dvd.I was very disappointed with this dvd."
5,"well researched, Cape Cod specific","112 pages, paperback, copyright 1983. purchaced new in Camden, Maine, late May 1999. more were in stock. 2nd printing 1996. Mine is signed by the author ( YIPPEE!!! ) 29 entries in Biliography. I'm giving it 5 stars because it is site specific, gives a brief overview of Lightships, and all Lightsships, but is very focused on Cape Cod and the Islands. Includes local lore and ledgend from crew mwmbers, all the way up until the Nantucket Lightship was replaced in 1986, the last of all Lightships. By the way, the Nantucket that was sank by the Titanic's sister-ship was recently found."
2,There's better books on this . . .,"This book has problems. If you want to read a thoughtful, Scripture-backed book on what to expect in Heaven, I suggest Randy Alcorn's."
1,For the feeble-minded,"This is a shallow and obviously speculative account of the afterlife for feeble-minded American consumers. DeStefano's desire for a heaven based on the Pepsi Generation's focus-grouped notion of God and ""fun"" does not make it so. The immaturity of this book is staggering."
1,Scarey,"I have never in my life read such claptrap. Heaven as Disneyland is such an utterly ignorant concept I'm at a total loss. That people read this book and are uplifted actually scares me. It's McReligion made real. I suggest books like ""The Tao Te Ching"" or ""The Prophet"" or even ""Conversations With God"" for a more fulfilling and reality based journey into spirituality. However, if what you're aiming for is a few hours of reality-avoidance and want heaven to be something like 1950's America, then maybe this book is the one for you."
5,FUN!!!,"What fun!!! I totally enjoyed reading this very uplifting book. As a religion teacher I am so excited to have a book like this to share with the high school children I have contact with. Some have confided a fear of being ""stuck"" in heaven. They can't imagine heaven being anything less then boring. This book is changing their fear and apprehension to joy and anticiapation. I am looking forward to reading it again."
3,Intriguing To Ponder,"A TRAVEL GUIDE TO HEAVEN by Anthony DeStefano Although this book has gotten rave reviews in many sectors, I found it a bit unreal and too materialistic. DeStefano's idea of heaven is like a rich person's ideal sight-seeing tour, and he takes you on a real tour of all the places and experiences you will have if you live right and die good. According to other reviews this is ideal for Christians who take the promises of gold paved streets and pearly gates literally, and it is of great comfort to dying patients and their families. I guess the book serves as a bright, fanciful tourist guide for people who need that kind of belief, but I prefer to think of Heaven as a place of deep mystery and no need of materialism, a place where God IS, and that will be all that matters to us then."
2,Can You Pass the Security Check?,"It is indeed a good thing that many people find this book helpful and encouraging. I am not one of them. Rarely do I put a book down because it is not holding my interest, but this happened on reading this publication. The scriptual references are interesting, but not thought provoking, and the same ideas are repeated over and over. This approach is far better than the fire and brimstone ravings, and certainly heaven is not a place of pearly gates and golden streets, but somehow these pages did not inform me or teach me and really didn't move me at all. Perhaps I am too influneced by the writings of C. S. Lewis whose The Great Divorce is indeed a heavenly book worth reading."
2,Not biblically sound,"I was disappointed in the book, it wasn't as sound bibically as I had imagined it to be. It was pure fantasy."
1,Read other books....such as the Bible,"I really enjoyed this book till page 15 When Destefano begins to desribe the ""interim phase"" which sounds a lot like ""soul sleep."" This idea that those who die remain unconscious until the resurrection, is not backed up by the bible, which is where Destefan supposedly gets his references for his book. There is a reason he quotes the scriptures with numbers and records them in the back of his book....it is because the scriptures just don't fit HIS picture of Heaven. I do hope others will continue to read other books, such as John MacArthur's ""The Glory of Heaven,"" who quotes the scriptures immediately. Read other books about this topic before you recommend it."
3,1 Stars Reviewers ...,"I'm considering getting this book, and in reading the negative reviews, they all seem to come from the same modern-day, skeptical mindset that misses the point of even reading a book like this. Many start by saying NO ONE knows what Heaven will be like, then they proceed to say DeStefano is WRONG, WRONG, WRONG! Well, if they're so sure we can't know about Heaven, how do they know he's WRONG, WRONG, WRONG? What's so bad about reading the book as positing possibilities? The book seems to avoid being ""scientific"" on purpose ... why put its ideas under a microscope before saying its approach is helpful or not? Maybe he's pushing the envelope a little, but do we really need more voices telling us we can know little or nothing about Heaven? These kinds of criticisms make me MORE interested in getting the book!"
5,Gives you something to look forward to....,"I think most people do not have a good picture in their mind of what Heaven is like. While it is good to have a picture of Hell, so you know where you don't want to be (and most people can picture a Hell), I think it is equally important to have a picture of where you want to be. A goal to keep in mind. This is a very quick read and gives a humorous, thoughtful look into what heaven could be like, and gives you something to strive towards attaining. I certainly wouldn't mind living eternally in this vision of heaven!"
1,"Wow, talk about long lines!","I find it hilarious that nearly everyone who has written a review of this book also implies that they,too, will be going along for the big ride to Candyland. Along with all of their loved ones and dead pets. Sure gonna be crowded.I also find it remarkable that Destefano and his ilk would consign a law-abiding, generous atheist to the burning pit while someone with the crimes of a Manson or Pol Pot would get into heaven if he accepted Jesus before he croaked.Do they sincerely believe this nonsense? Oh yeah... and if you're Jewish or Buddhist or anything else, you are not welcome past the bouncer at the door eitherAlso gotta love the guardian angel bit. In any sane circles, hearing voices in the night is regarded as dementia. But then sanity doesn't really enter into all of this does it?Can't wait for the sequel on hell complete with little red devil and pitchforks."
3,just for beginners,"I agree with the one reviewer who said that the workout seemed too chopped up with the one minute concept. And yes, it does play the same exercises sometimes. The problem for anyone not a beginner is, you really need 2-3 sets per exercise to feel it and this format only allows you one. It is a good concept but having a menu choice of how many sets you want to do, in addition to how long you want to work out for and how intensely might just make this DVD a 5 star. I prefer my Tamilee Webb ""I Want Those..."" series."
5,Why don't they make more this way?,"Why don't they make more workout dvd's this way! Good for those starting out and added weight allows for long continued use. My 73 year old mother even can follow this one. I can choose how long to workout, choose what body part to concentrate on if desired, and the routines are simple to follow. No spending precisous workout time to learn the workout. The fact that this dvd is difficult to find and holds it's resale value says it: people keep this dvd. The only down side I can see is it is low on cardio, but there are so many other workouts out there incorporating cardios that it isn't a problem. Great addition for those who enjoy walking for their cardio."
4,"Great workout, but too many repeated exercises","I LOVE Minna and the concept behind this 1-Minute Workout DVD is great. Supposedly there are over 100 one-minute segments, and your DVD will randomly choose the ones suited to your choice of body parts (upper, lower, abs, total body) and intensity level. The problem is, the exercises still repeat. Today I chose a 36 minute workout, and the exercises were already repeating 13 minutes after I started.Anyway, I will still use this DVD...I figure the extra reps won't hurt me. LOVE Minna. She is so down-to-earth and easy to follow."
3,Hardly Boredom Free...,"I was slightly disappointed by this DVD. Although I like the concept of a constantly changing workout video, this one doesn't have enough ""1 minute"" segments in my opinion. I generally get the same segments repeated 3 or 4 times PER WORKOUT. It's not a horrible thing, but just don't get too overly impressed by the claims that there are a million workout possibilities contained within this DVD. Are there an almost infinite number of ORDERS these segments could be put in? Sure. But when the segments are repeated multiple times within the same 15 minutes, it kind of defeats an ""boredom busting"" qualities this DVD might have."
4,Stays interesting due to variety :->,"You wouldn't think you'd get much benefit from a dvd like this, but let me tell you that you will burn calories. It stays fresh and interesting because you can do the routine in any order and for any desired length of time. There are 127 different one-minute segments each focusing on different body parts and you can control the order you do it in. This way you won't get bored and you'll be inclined to do this often. Minna is a good instructor and with her help, you can get through this easily and have fun at the same time. I recommend this if you are someone who bores easily with the usual exercise grind."
4,Different from the norm,"I always said I didn't have time for exercise, with this dvd I have no excuses. Even the fast-track option which gives you about a 4 minute workout is nice. Although I have had some exercises repeat, it didn't bother me. I also liked the combination of workouts with weights.I welcomed the fact Minna focused more on being fit than on losing weight. Losing weight is nice, but I would rather be healthy and fit than skinny and sickly.I would recommend this to a friend."
4,good work out,I originally didn't like this dvd because of the breaks in between segments but now I love it. It really works me out..I do level 2 and I'm so glad I purchased it because workouts can be really boring with the same dvd. Not this one. I liiiiike!
5,HUGE FAN,"I have always had a hard time working out at home, and become soooo bored doing the same routine over and over. This DVD is so easy to fit into my life - do the Quick Workout while dinner is cooking, or right before hopping in the shower. You can adjust the main workout to do whatever you need --- tone your arms? Have the DVD pull exercises that focus on upper body moves. AND, I have to say, some of the moves combine yoga/pilates based poses with a twist that really makes them challenging.Suitable for any level of fitness - make it work for you! Good luck!"
3,Good but....,"I enjoy the individual exercises but I find that whatever length segment I choose there are always repetitions. I'll start out with minute A and move on to B and C but then here comes A again. It gets annoying having to skip over them. I don't know if anyone else has experienced this but I don't like doing a challenging shoulder minute only to do the same minute 2 moments later! Also I would only advise those with more experience to use this because there is not much explanation for each move, which may be needed when trying to ""roll like a ball,"" a pilates move that requires more explanation to help prevent injury. I still love Minna and will continue to use the DVD, I'll just have my remote handy."
4,pretty good,"dvd is well done, mina is a good teacher, workout is pretty good. I do a full body workout 8 mins level 2 , 5 times a week, and I am getting in better shape.For the price pretty decent dvd."
3,Not great.,"Since the routine changes every time you do it, you don't know whether to go to the floor or stay up for the next exercise, being that the floor and stand up routines are not separated."
3,A little disappointed,"I have been a long time Minna Lessig fan and had pre-ordered this item as I was excited to have a new DVD from her. However, I found that the same exercises played over up to three times and I didn't like how chopped up it was with the one minute concept. From reading others reviews it appears I am in the minority, but although this seemed like a good idea, I just don't like it and have found that I don't use it at all. I also found it is probably more appropriate for the beginner to early intermediate level."
2,Disappointed,"I'm not too impressed with this DVD. A lot of the exercises I don't find challenging enough for just a minute's time. Also, I first started out with Level 1 and found that most of those were too easy. So the next time I switched to Level 2, and got many of the same exercises that I had in Level 1. Also, as another reviewer said, it doesn't always give you exercises for the amount of time you requested. If you don't count the exercises and watch the time on the clock, before you know it, you will have done 45 minutes when you just asked for 20 minutes. Ultimately that's not a bad thing, but if you're pressed for time, it is! One of the features that attracted me to this DVD was being able to choose from different workout times, but if it's not going to work properly, then it's pointless to even offer this feature."
5,Finally an Exercise DVD I Consistently Use,"This program works as advertised. I'm very satisfied with all the options this program offers. There seem to only be 2 or 3 warm up routines - but that doesn't bother me. I really like being able to select my workout level, how long I want to exercise and target certain areas. The exercises are easy to follow and provide a good workout for each minute routine. It is definitely worth the money. This DVD is my first choice when I exercise to a DVD and I don't get bored with the variety."
1,"Eesh! A horrible, horrible game.","Man alive, is this game bad or what? The graphics are way below par, even if it were on a playstation 1, never mind a Gamecube. The gameplay is pathetic and the camera movements disorientating. What a worthless game!I totally love Warner's Batman animation and it's cool that they do all the games in this way. Batman: Vengeance could well have turned out great as they got off to a good start by keeping all the gothic visuals and voice actors but they seriously stumbled when it came to playability and graphics. The result is a boring game that looks incredibly cheap and is no fun to play whatsoever. I really must stress how bad the graphics are. Don't let the color schemes fool you. I've seen better stuff on a Commodore 64."
3,Batman on xbox,I did not really know any of the controls. I would not waste my money on Batman Veneance. I hope now that you understand my statement.
4,This game is really cool,"This game is awesome if your any good at it. I read one of the reviews and the guy who wrote it said it was to hard because in first person you have to switch your to the write item while walking. That gets a lot easier. He said it was too hard for other reasons too. If to hard,why are my sister and I on the next to last level in 4 weeks,(although I'm pretty good at these kind of games)he must be an easy game addict. It's really cool because you get to play against all the main villians and their thugs, if you combine buttons you can do cool moves when fighting, the pics in between play are good, and you don't know what to expect. The only thing that's bad about it is it doesn't have Robin. This game is worth its money if you like fast action adventure games that makes it a challenge to figure out what to do."
2,Ok but not a purchase,"This game does not look stupid, but i am not a batman fan, and from many I heard it was terrible. But I you are a batman fan this looks good."
2,Just another action game,"Well I feel like I just wasted $50. This game is very repetitive. Punch, punch, kick, punch. The flying and driving scenes only make it worse. The controls for Batman and the batplane are horrid. Batman runs when you push the control to the limit and walks every other time. The result is a jerky motion that is made worse by the 3rd person perspective that limits your view. This game does have great looking cut scenes and few neat gadgets, but these cannot make up for the inferior game play. Ubi Soft wasn't using the GameCube to its full advantage. This game feels like a rough port from another system"
3,ummmm... Okay,this game was my third one. it is pretty fun. the controls r easy and you get to take on some of batmans worst enemys. this game isnt the best one in the world. its just okay. so if your bored and have 19$ you should just get this.
1,"This game is horrible, overall!!","The graphics and the sound are great, but these favorable qualities are totally nullified but the deplorable, frustrating gameplay. The camera angles are enough to make you want to stop playing the game, forever."
2,Truely Disappointing,"I rented this game recently and was very disappointed by the graphics and game play. Moving around was very very difficult and the color and graphics were not very good. also there is far too much cinematics and movies, makes the game LONG and boring!! I am a true supporter of Nintendo and especially Gamecube, i own 7 of the current games... but this is NOT worth buying unless you have alot of patience..."
2,Noisy Shoes!!!! Quality slipping,"I have owned Bostonian shoes for the past 30 years. I recently purchased two pairs of the Danvers loafers, one in black and one in burgundy. These shoes are now made in CHINA! The construction is not as good as when they were made in America, Europe or South America. The shoes squeak as you walk. The man made sole cannot handle New York sidewalks. They have begun to show rapid wear already. I do not expect to last as long my previous pairs of Bostonian shoes. I am sorry to say that I will have to switch to another brand in the future."
4,Excellent fun with minor drawbacks,"The simpsons road rage was really a blast! The game allows you to drive through the enourmous levels of Evergreen Terrace, The entertainment district, springfield dam, downtown, the nuclear powerplant, and the springfield mountains, with many sights to see such as the elementary school, burns's mansion, springfield gorge, the tire fire, and many more. You can unlock 17 familiar characters such as chief wiggum, professor frink, and barney. Gameplay is fun, you drive around, picking up passengers and delivering them to their destinations before the time runs out. Two player mode is a blast as well. The one major disappointment is that this game is pretty much a total and complate copoff of crazy taxi. So I would guess that if you enjoy crazy taxi and you're a simpsons fan, this would be the game for you."
2,WARNING WARNING THIS IS NOT A GOOD GAME!!!!!,THIS GAME IS REALLY GLICHY{IT LOCKS UP AND THE SCREEN GOES WACK}BUT THE FIRST 4 DAYES YOU PLAY IT I ROCKES BUT THEN AFTER A WHILEIT GETS BORING BECAUSE YOU NEED MORE MISSIONS AND YOU HAVE TO GET SO MUCH MONEY ON SINGLE PLAYER ROAD RAGE. BUT A GOOD SIDE IS THE GAME HAS GOOD GRAPHICS AND EXTRA FUNNY VOCABULARY IT WILL MAKE YOU LAUGH LOTS AND ITS GOT SOME GRATE CHEATS. WELL THATS ALL I WANT TO SAY IF YOU WHANT TO PAY [THE MONEY] TO HAVE ABOUT 5 HOURS OF FUN MORE POWER TO YOU.
2,WORST GAME CUBE GAME EVER,This is the stupidest Game Cube Game I've played. I mean there is no replay value in it. All you do is pick up people and get money for it. I mean it's a very easy game to so you get tired of it very fast. And the voices in it get boring after the first few minutes. In a way don't get this game PLEASE DON'T.
4,short but good,"yeah this game is good.couple of glitches like driving through walls,but still good.voice acting great and well just don't pause whilethey are talking they will pause the sound.(another glitch ...Time is prety short to drive to places and it is a pretty long game but once you finish road rage its over and missions are imposible and sunday drive is bad.another glitch is when people talk they talk at the same time.otherwise its good."
1,An Odd Game,"This is a fun game at first, but after about one hour it loses its luster. And to top it all off, there are only five or six stages!"
2,really not that fun,this game is pretty pointless you pick people off and then drop them off its really fun for a while this is not a game anyone would want to have in the longrun
2,Cum-see-cum-sa (OK),"Thisw game is extreamly funny the first time you play. But once you get used to it they say the same things and they become less and less funny. You start to memorize where specific characters are and specific routs to there destinations. I don't want to give away the ending but the ending of the game is down right bad. the game takes alot of patence but is esay to beat. You probbably want to reant this first 'cause if you buy it, you will get about a weaks fun out of it. But if you really want to play an arcade style racer, get crazi taxi. Thank you."
2,Naaaah.,"Unless you're an abseloute die hard fan of the Simpsons, and you must have all the merchendise, skip this game. There's nothing too special about it, and there are other games out there like it that are much better. Even Crazy Taxi is better than this. Not reccomended."
2,"OK, kinda boring",This game is fun at first but it gets boring just driving people around its funner in multiplayer. i really wouldnt really reckemend this game but if your a simpsons funatic youll love it!
4,Simpsons Road Rage!,"The Simpsons Road Rage, in my opinion is a very basic game. The only thing you get to do in the game is carry person by person to their destination. The only other feature is the mini-games, where you can test-drive everybody's vehicles in obstacle courses, (usually destroying things). But at least you get a reward! In the Simpsons Road Rage, you start off where Mr.Burns has bought all the bus companies out and has turned them into radioactive buses. The only way to stop him is to put him out of business, as well as saving up enough to buy his business. At the beginning all the characters that you can choose from are Homer, Bart, Marge, Lisa, and Abe (or just grandpa). Each character has their own car that you will see in certain episodes of the Simpsons. As you collect more and more money from being your own taxi, you can unlock different characters, and different areas to race in. But mainly the thing that makes it a good game is that you get to destroy everything!"
2,The most repetitive game ever,OK this game has one of the best licences out there. Most people love the Simpsons and it's great to see it in a game after a long absence. The game copies Crazy Taxi in every way but doesn't do it nearly as well. Springfield is reconstructed quite well but there just isnt enough variety in the locations at all.The first time u pick up a passenger u will enjoy the ride and the one-liners from the show but soon they will get annoying. The game just stays the same all the way: Pick up passenger and drop him/her off. There is no variety at all. And also the car handles a bit crap and it's not much fun driving around after a few days. Worth a rent only.
3,Fun . . . for short amounts of time,"This is a fun game. Especially, if you are a Simpsons fan! The game play is exactly like Crazy Taxi. This game is most fun playing with someone. The comments that the caracters make can get repetitative, so switch characters often. Also, I found I couldn't play this game for much longer than an hour at a time. But with friends for short amounts of time, a great game."
4,Okay Game,This game is very good the graphics are okay the soundtrack is okay and it is very funny.Great game for simpson lovers it has 6 worlds and you can drive around with about 30 characters.As I said it is very funny but once you have it for a long time it gets boring.But to make it more interesting the game has many codes to make it interesting longer.
4,one of my favorite games,"This is a great game! You can play with over a dozen charectars from The Simpsons. And there are the actual voices. The only problem I have with it is who is the really secret charectar that you need 1,000,000. And why isn't Dr. Hibbert in this game? If you are reading this creators of game make a sequal and put Hibbert in it."
4,Great Game,The Simpsons Road Rage is a great game.If you liked Crazy Taxi for Dreamcast and PS2 and are a Simpsons fan {like me} you'll love this game.
3,This *is* Crazy Taxi,"I saw this game at E3 and wondered if it was a joke or not. It is Crazy Taxi but with object models based on the Simpsons.If you've never played Crazy Taxi, and you love the Simspons, then this game is definitely for you. Crazy Taxi's formula provides hours of arcady entertainment and is great at parties.If you've picked up Crazy Taxi for another platform already, this game will bring you the same exact gameplay but Simpsonized."
5,This is one fun game!,"The characters of the Simpson's television show drive people around town in order that they aren't subjected to Mr. Burns transportation. I bought crazy taxi for my 10 year old and the music and language was too much. This version is lots more fun because there is a plot and the music is pleasant. Anything you have heard on the Simpsons show you can expect here. Remember the episode when Marge was driving the Canyonero? Well, you can play that out here. The mood is upbeat and can be played for money or simply for the fun of it, you choose. Well worth the $"
2,"OK, but boring","Im a big Simpsons fan, and for the first two hours or so of gameplay the things people said were funny, but it gets really repetative. The cars don't change that much, and there are only five levels, so after a little bit it just gets boring. All you do is drive people around. If you arent a simpsons fan i dont see how this would be an interesting game at all. I might get it, but wait till the price drops... alot"
2,good game but not worth 50 bucks,this game is basically crazy taxi. the only difference is that you get to play as simpsons. it is fun but nothing great. its biggest flaw is that it get repetitive very quickly.
5,if you like crazy taix..........,This game is just like crazy taxi.So if you like crazy taix you will love this game.You object is to drive over 25 simpson carectors to where they want to be.You can see almost all of springfeild.I would get this game.I give it 5 stars.GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"Good to rent, not to own unless for cheap","Being a HUGE simpsons fan, I was a little disappointed by Road Rage, it does have huge similiarities to crazy taxi (which after a week get's pretty dull) yet I think this game is a lot more fun because of character voices- You can unlock different drivers and city scenes such as downtown springfield, the entertainment district (which is hilarious), and the nuclear power plant... The graphics are kinda sad- but hey it's the Simpsons!!Good for comical play with a friend, but I doubt any serious gamers (which i'm not) would love this game.If you're an avid simpsons fan- it's good to have this in your collection...but otherwise, not a good buy- just a fun day of game play ..."
1,horrible!!,this game is most patheic dont get it! get x box and the game prisenors of war. great game.y shouldnt u get this game because its just plain hoirrinble dont get this sorry for any typos
2,...,"Listen up: This game IS crazy taxi, but worse. Wow so its the Simpsons, but the only good thing about this game is the sound. If you have Crazy Taxi for DC, PS2 or GC, dont waste ur cash on this. The grafix may look cool, but they are a cheaply done 2D/3D mixture. Sure it has more characters than Crazy Taxi, but Crazy taxi is in a much better 3D world, with great music, a great ORIGINAL idea for a game, and Sega just has done a much better job. Hopefully, the Simpsons Skateboarding, wont be a cheap 2D/3D copy of THPS."
4,"As text books go, this is pretty good","Easy to Read, Easy to Follow, Lots of diagrms, Helped me pass my exams, A bit overpriced though."
3,Good book but just for concept,"This book is good for someone who needs concepts of Digital comm design or modem design. It is very easy to read and understanding but not very helpful for practical design. Like I said, it is good for a beginner, i.e., junior or senior year. It will not fulfil graduate student requirement."
2,avoid if you can!,"Having used this book extensively during communication classes at university, my advice would be to avoid it if you can because ALL the answers provided to the exercises are wrong!! Once you think that you have grasped the theory and want to practice you will first notice that you are never able to get the answers right, after trying for an hour or more you will speak to your tutor about it and realise the book is completely wrong! And I must warn you that this will not happen once or twice, it will happen to about 50% of the exercises or more throughout the book. Which will make you lose a lot of time, other than that, quiet honnestly the theory is well explained with simple diagrams and examples. But still, try to find something else."
1,"Nice playing, no instruction at all","This DVD is basically 2 hours of Chuck Leavell talking about himself and playing through some songs that he is known for. He does not explain anything he is doing and there is no sheet music to reference (one of the references says there is sheet music - there is NOT). I would NOT recommend this as an instructional tool for anyone. I love hearing and watching him play, but I was hoping that he would take some time to explain or at least demonstrate slowly what he's doing. All in all, a waste of money and time"
2,Interesting but not instructional,"I'm a huge CL fan, and got interested in playing piano in part, because of the great music CL plays.But while the DVD is interesting, it was more style over substance. Not that that is bad, the video's are worth the price. But since CL doesn't really read music, they never show any music, and the teaching is very limited."
2,mislabled; item does not come complete with book as advertised,"Very engaging stories and a variety of licks are contained on this DVD. However, there is no book of notation of the licks as is advertised on Amazon. IMO, It is not worth the price charged without the book. In fact, it is either shameful false advertising at its worst or badly written and misleading advertising at it's best. Don't waste your money."
1,"Sunex 3674 12 Piece 3/8"" Standard Drive SAE Impact Socket Set by Sunex",did not honor price I bought it for bad customer servicehad no idea pricing was wrong and now they will not honorBeware customer service no help
2,"Begins effectively, but then it's all downhill","MASTER OF LIES is not one of Masterton's best. The opening chapter is TOO effective, one of the scariest thing's I've ever read. It begins with a man in a horned mask bursting into a police officer's family's apartment and nailing them to the floorboards, raping the wife and ends with the man about to kill their children. It takes a lot to scare me, but the first time I read the opening chapter of this book I was nearly sick; I was amazed that this could actually get published.Anyhow, this act of sadism is part of a ritual to raise a demon known as Belial. Cop Larry Foggia is assigned the task of capturing the monster who killed his partner.Unfortunately, after Masterton nearly scares you to death with chapter one, it's all downhill from there. He's written some great books, but this isn't one of his best in my opinion. But if you think nothing can scare you, just read the opener. This book is also known as BLACK ANGEL."
4,durable,"nothing special- looks just like picture. this is a simple, yet durable yoga mat bag, and i like it. i've hauled it all over nyc without a problem."
2,Strap isn't strong enough,"I have an X-long mat so I need a big mat bag. This one isn't cheap, but I bought it anyway. After about a year the strap broke, and sewing it back on didn't work so I had to buy a new one. I bought this mat bag again and this time the strap broke in less than 4 months and I don't even use it very often! I gave it 2 stars because it's big and easy to carry, but quality wise it just isn't worth the $"
3,Yoga Mat Bag,"Okay bag. Handle not long enough, would have liked it to be able to sling on my back. Barely goes over my shoulder. Not worth what I paid for it."
3,It's ok,"It does not look as nice as it shows on the website, and it's a little easier to get dust on it, my yoga mat does not fit it perfectly, but ok."
2,Looks and feels cheap,"Unfortunately I am quite disappointed. It claims to be 100% cotton but it doesn't feel like it, and the color is not that nice. I chose the purple from the color palette on Amazon and it is much louder than it looks.Overall, it does the job, but it could be classier."
1,Way too small - extra large it is NOT,"Good construction for the price BUT, it is NOT extra large. My thin mat barely fits and it takes work to get it in and out. There is an small outside pocket but once the mat is in, you can't fit much. You could get a towel in there."
3,OK for beginners,"The bag isn't horrible if you're a yoga beginner. I didn't find it to be all that big or sturdy. It's acurately described as cotton twill - like khaki pants. The zipper doesn't seem like it's up for heavy duty use. If you've just started yoga and don't go more than once a week or so then this bag is good for you. You don't need something too heavy duty. But if you're at the studio a few times a week and have an extra long mat and blanket (like me) this bag is neither large or sturdy enough.That said, when I returned the bag my refund was prompt and polite. Although the product wasn't for me, the customer service was positive."
5,easy to use,"I bought this mat bag after getting Bean's non-toxic extra thick yoga mat which is great by the way Bean Products Yoga Mat 1/4"" Extra Thick High Density 72"" Length - Clean PVC (TM) Phthalate Free PER because the mat didn't fit in my old small mat bag. Its nice and big and easy to fit my extra thick mat and water bottle, towel etc. Well made, heavy cotton and finally something made in the USA!!!!!"
4,Bean Yoga Mat Bag,"Been using the bag for a couple months now and it's holding up well. The side pocket for wallet/keys is handy. I have a long, thicker mat that doesn't leave much room for anything else, other than a mat towel and a face towel, which in most cases is just enough."
3,OK product....,"This item was ordered because it was the size to hold a rather large yoga mat. It does have the size to accommodate the mat. On the other hand, I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the materials. The fabric is very light and thin. The zipper is a light to medium duty zipper. Overall the product is not very impressive."
5,Great Bag,"I like this bag a lot. It is plenty big enough (mat, water bottle, towel, with room to spare) but not too big or bulky. At the end of class I don't have to struggle with getting the mat into the bag or worry about the mat sticking out at one end and getting dirty, as with some other bags. I think it fits nicely over the shoulder, zipper works well, and lots of colors to choose from. Yep, I'm happy with this bag."
2,Small bag and not so good customer support.,"The bag seems like it is well made, but it is not an Oversized bag as they say in the description. The real issue for me is that I am having trouble returning it to EverythingYoga. I paid $19.95 for it and they will only refund $15.62. Plus the cost of sending it back to them. Small bag and not so good customer support."
3,its okay,"Reasonably priced. Still not sure how to actualy fill it with sand???? There are no openings! No Zipper, NO NOTHING! I think it has to be cut open. Cant find help with this matter either!"
3,GOOD - Oppinion,"It is a book easy to understand, however it is more kind of like oppinion oriented than fact oriented."
1,bad experience,"The level of craftsmanship was insulting. It's difficult to understand how a company can attempt to brand such a weak product, and expect it to help establish a solid reputation. The knife in this server set will bend with little use.I cannot possibly imagine this knife holding together while cutting a multi-layer wedding cake. Can you imagine having your wedding knife bend or break during such a special moment in your life???Even if the server set was sturdy and solid feeling, the design these items had looked weak and almost as if there was some malfunction while being milled/cast or whatever...Spare yourself the disappointment."
5,Good advice and very realistic.,"This book has definately prepared me for the challenges that are ahead of me. Creating an intranet is the easy part of the process. The book discusses the politics that are involved and what obstacles you may need to overcome. Regardless of it not being a ""technical"" book, it gave me a more clear understanding of exactly how the whole thing works, and political steps I might need to take to prepare myself and my company. I would recommend this book to anyone who may be involved in the process - beginning or advanced."
2,Not Very Useful,"You would think that with five authors there would be something useful in this book. Unfortunately, this book is all about the politics of Intranets and not about actually building one. There is one page with an outline of possible Intranet topics, but other than that there is no help on Intranet content."
3,Not very useful,"It is way to basic, if you've been running an intranet in a largish size company then you don't need this book. If you just got thrown to the wolves though then this may (or may not help). I can't honestly recommend this book."
2,A good effort but outdated.,"If this was still 1998, this would be an excellent read but unfortunately, as with most material in this category (Web Usability), it ages too quickly."
5,Music to play a box to,"Not only is this a great album, it's fun to play a box to it. Take me and my friend, for example. We spent many a day listening to this album and relating to its anger and heartbreak. Then, we started a band that consisted of a box and covered P.R.D.C.T. Yeah, it was terrible (and we were called ""Lactose Intolerant""--ummm...) but the point is we were inspired. It created memories for us, regardless of how ear-splitting our excuse for a band was. If that isn't the best thing you can say for a great punk rock album, I don't know what is."
4,Girls En la garage,"Pottymouth has the making of a lo-fi grunge classic.the songs are very upbeat and the voices are young,immature.When it comes to comparison of style,I say bratmobile sounds like a mix of old SonicYouth &theBreeders. I being a long time fan of riot girlee music,I really dig this.The most slam'N song here is F**Yer Fans."
2,Lampitt series going downhill,"What started out as a magnificentseries of novels beginning withINCLINE OUR HEARTS and A BOTTLEIN THE SMOKE(2 of my favorite books of all time)has become a bore.While Wilson can stillwrite with great panache and wit;his characters have become dreary and turgid.I actually hadto force myself to finish this novel,something I thought I wouldnever have to do with a novel ofA.N.Wilson who still is one of my favorite authors."
2,Tough beginning,"This is my first A.N. Wilson book, so maybe I started with the wrong one, but just trying to get going with this one was extremely rugged. However, I managed to stay the course, and the last part kept me. Still a tough read."
1,Misleading product/purpose,"CETME and other similar HK rifles already come with a buffer integrated into the buttstock. The bolt carrier doesn't impact the rear of the receiver/buttstock assembly like in AK-47 and FAL rifles.If you need a buffer, get a surplus one or a new one made to HK specs. This will tear up your rifle by causing contact where there is none in the first place."
1,"I bought this for my 2 year old daughter, what a mistake","She has the rest of the books in this series, and loves dinosaurs... so I figured I found a keeper. I got it home and looked at the pictures and they scared ME! It's totally innappropriate for wee (and even not-so-wee) ones, in my opinion. The dinosaurs are *really* scary, and would virtually guarantee some serious nightmares at our house. I returned it without letting her see it."
2,Terrible ending to a nice thriller,"Read these Charles de Lint books instead: Seven Wild Sisters, Onion Girl, Waifs and Strays, the Green ManSPOILER!The book was good and kept my interest up to the end. I hated that Rachel died right after getting away from Harry. She was abused and stalked by her ex-husband and then stalked by his killer, kidnapped, had to fight off her insane attacker, and then got shot by a state trooper because she had a gun in her hand when she ran out the door. It was a bad ending. She didn't have to have a fairytale ending or anything, but it would have been good if she survive and she and Lily were going through therapy. And you don't know what happens between Tom's parents and Lily. Do they really try to take away everything their son made for his girlfriend just because she's Asian and not white?"
3,Sorry Charlie,"I love Charles de Lint.....however this book was not his best. I like Stephen King, Koontz, etc.....but this book has a ""ick"" factor. I just didn't care if I finished it (rare for me)."
4,Charles De Lint,"I love this author's works. This is one of his darker books. My favorite are in his imaginary Newford. Great stuff, urban fantasy as they call it."
1,Nothing Different from Illustrator CS Version!,"It's sort of sad that a book being advertised as being ""Completely Revised"" is completely the same. Even the date on the CD is 2003! I have the version for Illustrator CS and nothing has been changed between the two volumns, NOTHING! So save yourself some money and buy the version for Illustrator CS if it available. I'm so mad that I purchased this book I could scream. But instead I'm just going to rate the book with a big, fat one star. Maybe the author will get a clue for her next version."
4,Learning can be fun,"I use Adobe After Effects. I needed to get up to speed on basic Illustrator in order to ""feed"" vector graphics to AE. Although I have only had this book for a short while ... it allowed me to get to that point very quickly. I am finding it fun to read and am astonished by what Illustator CS2 can do. There is some leaning towards ""learning by doing this exercise exactly as we tell you"" with excercises ... (which I am not fond of) ... but it does help if you are a beginner (like me). I bought this book along with ""Adobe Illustrator CS2 How-Tos: 100 Essential Techniques"" and found that to be a great complimentary book. Highly recomended."
5,AMAZING!!,"Amazing quality, print is clear, makes your working place cosy and nice. I would also recommend you to find a similar rug desktop wallpaper. They look amazing together!"
2,its almost rubberish in texture,"I wasn't expecting a hand wovern rug but I was expecting something that would allow my mouse to move smoothly across it. Having just taken it out of the package the mouse moves with slightly less resistance on the ""rug"" side then it moves on the rubber side on the bottom.... yes this is just a regular mouse pad with a fringe glued on the side...It looks good! but its really kind of unusable fresh out of the box, I'm going to try and find a solution but I get the feeling this is not going to get any use"
1,No worky with lasers,"Mouse pad is built well, however it does NOT work with laser mouses. That note is no where to be found on the product page. That seems like a huge issue that consumers need to aware of. I feel cheated!"
2,Looks Good But Terrible Mouse Pad,"The effort it takes to move a mouse on the surface of this mouse pad outweighs the good lucks, sadly."
4,"Good compilation, but ironic medium",This is a good compilation from the Kill Rock Stars label. All the artists are punk rock or indie or whatever. I came to the record attracted by the Boredoms and Free Kitten songs. But a lot of the other artists I hadn't heard of turned out to be really good. This compilation might just serve as an introduction to these artists but the album is fun to listen to by itself too. I bought the LP version and have never seen the CD. It's really rather funny they did release this on CD because this record is clearly anti-CD. On the LP there is an essay by Sun Ra which explains that CDs are the lie which the industry uses to over charge the consumers.
5,"Thank you, Mr. Jackson","If you are a student of New York City or among the millions who love it, Kenneth Jackson's mammoth Encyclopedia is indispensible. I began using it as a reference book for my novel, The Five Points. Before I knew it, I was reading it from cover to cover. What a ride! What an achievement! While loaded with gorgeous illustrations, this is no coffee table book. This is a fact-filled guide to assist the serious student and amorous admirer through the intricacies of the greatest city on Earth. And unlike most books about New York City, this encyclopedia actually covers the other four boroughs, not just Manhattan! The enormous effort that went into this book will be gratefully acknowledged by anyone who reads it."
5,Great book,"I purchased this book as a gift for a friend who is a New Yorker and loves to know everything about the city he loves. He was thrilled with the book, as he'd been reading it already whenever he visited his brother, and said he can never put it down once he picks it up. Covers everything there is to know about NYC. I can't speak for myself, having not read it personally, but the hard core New Yorkers at the table when I gave it as a gift all swore by it!"
4,Very Nice Read,"JUST KISS ME by Kathleen O'Reilly, Tempt #889I enjoy the writing of the Temptations more and I tend to buy more of that series now in addition to my favorite Harlequin Presents. JUST KISS ME is bascially about opposites attract. A straight lace, neat freak, workaholic female lawyer who wants to walk on the wild side with a rough around the edges bad boy Airplane Mechanic. This story was more of a romantic comedy with some pretty funny lines. My most memberable moment, however, is this really hot steamy love scene during a New York City subway ride, in a crowded train in broad day light. It was hard to imagine nobody on the train not noticing the heroine enjoying her.........ahem ........moment when she wanted to scream on top of her lungs!"
2,"Solid, Heavy and Uncomfortable","I ordered this chair recently and was impressed with how heavy and sturdy it is. It's also quite easy to assemble with a few common tools and the supplied accessories. So it was to my great disappointment that, after letting the joint glue dry and sitting in it for the first time, I found it to be quite uncomfortable. In my book, you want the experience of sitting in a rocking chair to be one of ease and relaxation. This chair props you up with an overly prominent lumbar section, and requires you to drop your head way too far back in order to rest it. I had friends try it and they experienced the same awkward posture. This is one of those instances where you really wonder what the designers were thinking. Did they actually sit in the chair? I promptly returned it and Amazon was great in helping me get it shipped back."
4,Memories,"Watching this series brought back memories of rushing home from school, grabbing a bologna and cheese and sitting in front of the TV every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and not moving for the next 30 minutes to watch my generation version of ""Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers"".I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because like the previous volume some of the English tracks were missing, but that didn't take away from the enjoyment.Now if they would only put out a DVD set of ""Johnny Sokko and His Giant Robot"" , which was shown on Tuesday and Thursday, life would be complete."
4,Suwatch! We love Ultraman!,"I loved it when I was a kid and now my kids love it, too! Hayata is brave and handsome. My little girls all want to marry him. Ito is funny and silly. Aroshi is a great sharp-shooter. Fuji is smart and nice. Captain Mura is always in control. We laugh when it occasionally lapses into Japanese for no apparent reason. We gasp when Ultraman's light starts flashing. It's just as good as I remember it.I only have one complaint: if you put the captions on, it sometimes translates into some bad words. The actors aren't saying any cuss words, but it will show them on the screen! So, if your kids aren't reading yet, it won't matter. But if they are you might want to turn off those captions!"
5,Exactly what I wanted,"Just what I needed. This particular product is hard to find, twice now Amazon had it. The price is great as well."
3,Tarzan is both untamed and tamed at the same time.,"Tarzan is an okay game but the N64 and Playstation version were much,much better. Tarzan slides onto Gamecube and PS2 but slips and fails but succeds at the same time. Some times, if you grab an enemy with your hands, than you can see your hands go through them. The camera's just as untamed as the game's expectations. If you go left, the camera goes right. The short game plot is not helping either. Here's my advice: Rent it and see if it's good than if you like buy it. But to me, I think it's a rent game only."
3,Pretty good,"I bought this game for my 6 year old cousin, It has good graphics and sound effects are good but i reccomend this game for ages 5-10.This will be great for the kids"
2,I wouldn't reccomend this one...,"Okay, it's cool when you ski and bunjee jump. It is the COOLEST when Tarzan gets chomped by an alligator. I bought this game and now I am sorry I did. Look, if you really want to see Tarzan in action, see the movie. Otherwise, you would be much happier getting Super Smash Bros. Regardless of the above, you should not get this game if your age does not range between 4-9."
4,Definitely a group game!,"To me, this is one of the best games you can get. I understand that for the epxerienced gamer this isn't exactly the best, due to it being easy to learn and all, hence my not-full rating. But, and this is from experience, get a couple of kids taking turns whenever Tarzan dies, trying to complete the game? It's absolutely timeless. My friends and I screamed at the screen, yelling at each other and laughing our heads off trying to master the surfing and skiing levels, looking out for the reels of film that enable you to finish the game. And when it came to the boss levels, nothing was more nerve-racking as we struggled to remember the code and click the button at the same time. We worked together, and we had the best time. I think this is what the Playstation should be for, for group games! And Tarzan definitely is one."
2,the truth about this Tarzan...,"this game isnt the worst nor the best platform action adventure game ive played for gamecube. there are only a few out right now such as pacman world and donal duck quackers( crash bandicoot clone). i would pic both of those games over this one. the graphics are very cartoony but not to bad. the worst part of the whole game is in level 2 where the monkey falls into the water and you surf some ""rad"" rapids. you have to listen to rosie odonell the voice of the monkey scream for help the whole level. after that level my hatred for rosie odonnel doubled. for a childrens game this game is actually some what challenging. its not very hard but i think tarzan would be targeted towards younger kids which i think would have a hard time with the game. overall the game is pretty short. but i dont even think its worth buying but maybe a rent. but if you want a good platform get pacman world 2."
2,Disappointed,"The blanket arrived in a timely manner and was well packaged. However, I was expecting something that would be warm and plush. I can compare it to a baby's receiving blanket as far as thickness is concerned. Don't count on using it outdoors for warmth on true winter days. I would return it but my sister is a die hard Cowboys fan and she would appreciate it as a gift anyway."
4,Nice soft blanket,"I bought this as a gift for my uncle and he loved it. It is very soft and feels quality. He loved it so much he hung it over the curtain rod in his livingroom to ""display it"" to all who enters. The coloring is nice and rich and the fleece is substantially thick and plush yet still light weight. Good buy."
2,Way too thin.,"I was very pleased with how fast the shipment got to me but that blanket was just way too thin. If you are planning to use for display, then this is a great buy for you but if you want warmth, don't buy."
5,Great Jacket,I got this jacket for my boyfriend for Christmas and he really likes it. I got the black one with silver accents - I think it looks great for everyday use and will be a great ski jacket. Two thumbs up!
5,Great clock for the price,"Some have said that it is a very bright dial that will light up a room at night. That is partially true, but for me it almost acts as a night light when I sometimes get up in the middle of the night. It doesn't bother me, and certainly doesn't keep me awake at night. I would recommend it."
5,Servers the purpose!,"Love my new alarm clock! Simple, basic, easy to operate! The brightness is just right. The alarm sound is just right. Love it!"
4,ATT Alarm Clock review- value for money,"It is what I had expected it to be, a simple table watch. However, while ordering, I missed the fine print which said that it is a mains operated instrument. I was looking for a battery operated one, it would have been good if they had shipped a battery along with it too; would have saved a trip to the store. Otherwise, the device is performing perfectly for its price. Good value for money.."
5,Awesome clock,"This is a great little clock for displaying the time at night. No radio function, but for a basic alarm, this is awesome!"
5,Great no frills clock,This is a great alarm clock. I was looking for a easy to use no frills alarm clock at a good price. This little guy does the job. Since there is no radio there are no confusing buttons on this unit. This clock would also be great for a guest room since it is very easy to set.
4,not bad,"I purchased this alarm clock for my kids, so they can start being more responsible. My kids unfortunately sleep right through the alarm, but they are really heavy sleepers.The display isn't very bright at all, perfect for a bedside table."
5,Nice product,it has a plug in cord. it has a 9v battery connector for battery backup. it is easy to set up. it is very nice. and i am very happy with this purchase. it has nice big size numbers that i can see easily. thank you amazon.
5,Does just what we wanted,My retired husband can become very engrossed in his projects and can lose track of time. I have been scattering a variety clocks around the house. Clock number 8 will go in his study. The clocks all have alarms. This clock is electric but has a battery backup. We like it.
3,Easy to use clock with a VERY bright display,"The time and alarm setting are simple and easy to use. The size of the clock is nice, not too big. Daytime viewing is good, but the display at night is very bright - there is no dimming available, either auto or manual. In order to sleep, I've been turning the clock face down."
4,Works well so far,"it is an inexpensive clock, look cheap but for the price, it seems to keep correct itme so far. I would have rated lower if I paid more than 10 bucks for this clock."
4,Good price and holding up well,Nothing special about this but the price is good and it works. Haven't had it long enough to tell how well it will hold up but after two months no problems yet.
4,Quality Alarm,"Good size, easy to read bright green LED alarm clock. The alarm itself could be a little louder for sound sleepers."
3,good item,"I like the fact that the numbers are big, the green color stands out in the dark better than the red numbers and the cost was reasonable."
5,Great Clock,Easy to change the time on the clock. Easy to set an alarm. Nice big snooze button. I haven't actually used it for my alarm though.
1,should be zero stars for this clock,"If time flies, this clock was already flapping its wings before it got to me....half of the digital display did not show...I had the hour but the minutes were only partially visible....the good thing is that Amazon's return policy works exceptionally well. I contacted Amazon, printed out the postage paid return label and sent it back right away....and got a refund credit within a few weeks."
1,get what u pay 4,Low quality from china (as usual).... arrived with Part of the lights not working..just put in trash....not worth even spending my time to send it back
5,Great Value,"I bought one of these needing just a basic alarm clock that I could see the time at night. Because of the good reviews and only 8 bucks decided on this. My wife, however, liked it better than her old one, so I bought 2 more- one for me & one for my hunting camphouse."
3,alarm clock,"This alarm clock is okay. The only downside is, as far as I can tell, there is no alarm ""reset"" button. So you have to switch the alarm off if you want it to stop buzzing, and remember at some point before you go to sleep to turn it back on. Otherwise it's fine. And was pretty cheap."
3,good for the money,"easy to use and very fasfionable with a green light that is not to bright, i kinda wish it were a little brighter though, not as catchy as the traditional red light"
4,Does the job!,I needed an alarm clock with a snooze feature that was small enough to fit on top of a small bedside table. This is a no frills alarm clock that works very well. My only complaint is that the alarm ring is TOO LOUD!!!!! No chance of sleeping in with this alarm clock!!!
2,Constant humming sound - very annoying,It constantly hums and is really annoying. Took me awhile to figure out where it was coming from but definitely not worth your time.
4,i liked it,"this is a good alarm. its easy to use, i didnt even read the manual but its super easy to use. the sound is not high but not low."
3,Don't buy if your hearing is poor...,"...because it'll probably be useless to you as an alarm clock. I was really surprised at how quiet the alarm was the first time I used it. The problems seems to be that the speaker (or the sound vent) for the alarm is on the bottom of the clock and tends to be muffled by the surface the clock sits on.Otherwise, it's fine; small, easy to use and simple to set. Some reviewers have complained that the green numbers are too bright but I don't find it so. Sure, they could have built in a dimmer but then it probably wouldn't have been less than $10. I don't know, maybe the same is true for the alarm volume, but I don't think so."
3,What I wanted,"I liked this product. I wanted a small clock with not a lot of bells & whistles. The only option I would liked to have was a dimmer switch. It glows very bright, especially at night in a dark room. A dimmer would have helped cut down on the glow."
1,Stop working after 2 months,"It was working find until it just reset and blink all the time. If you disconnect and leave it out for a while, it will work again. But only for a couple days then it starts resetting and blinking again."
3,Green light is very bright,"Though this clock is functional, I bought it because I read reviews that the green LED light was not bright. How people can say that I don't know because I have had to turn the clock away from me at night because the light is so bright it lights up the room."
1,Clock arrived defective,"When the clock arrived I read the instructions, plugged it in and set the time. I really liked the easy to see green display. However, I found that the hour digit never changed. I set the clock again on a different hour, and still the hour never changed. I asked for a refund and received one promptly. Thanks Amazon, even though the clock was defective getting a refund was painless."
4,"Not very loud, about normal volume and tone.",I saw someone say it was very loud. But it is NOT very loud. It's about the normal tone of an alarm clock which I can sleep through. It would have been nice if you can adjust the volume of the alarm.
3,Okay product,"Works like any alarm clock should but my main gripe is that it stops working once I yank the cord.The instruction manual states that the thing works on battery power but so far that has not been the case.Besides, who uses 9V batteries in this age? They are quite difficult to use and I would have preferred that the clock use AA or AAA batteries.Nevertheless the product works fine.At least it wakes me up so I don't arrive late to work."
3,Small clock....,I ordered this without really checking it's size. I had a similar one that was around 3xs as big...maybe made by the same company. This one is small enough that it can be hard to see the time across a large room. Also it seems to be losing about 1 minute per day according to a clock linked to the atomic clock in Boulder. Too small and inaccurate = not so good.* turns out it isn't losing 1 min per day....but did lose 7-8 mins at one point possibly due to a power outage...even though a battery is installed....giving this 3 stars...
5,good alarm clock,A simple alarm clock that works with proper alarm. I recommend it for the value it will wake you up.
5,PERFECT INEXPENSIVE BUT FULLY FUNCTIONAL!,"My Husband is not very good with electronics and needed something that was functional and easy to set....the function buttons make it easy to figure out and are large enough for someone with less than perfect eye sight. Just what seller described and what my Husband needed, just simple and easy to follow without instructions....a few clicks and it is set! Sometimes less is more! Thanks!"
2,Advance Time Techonligy Led 6-Inch Alamr Clock Green.,Product dont work correctly.The time change or get delay.Time get our of range by the days...Battery dotn prevent lost time when you disconect for 5 or more secs.-1 for this
3,"This thing works, but the button design is annoying . . .","My old alarm clock (may she rest in peace) was just as basic as this, but could be operated with one hand. I could simply reach over and set the clock without sitting up on my bed. Sadly, I can't say the same for this.On a positive note, this has been reliable. Also, it survives flash power outages (about a second in length) even without the optional battery."
2,Buttons don't work,It worked fine until about 2 years after buying it when the minute button stopped working. Pretty cheap alarm clock all around. I have to buy a new one now.
2,Not recommended,"There are several shortcomings with this product:- Battery is not included, and the battery is one of those weird ones. Why not two AA?- If you want to use it with battery, you still can't remove the cord, so it dangles from the clock.- It is made of very cheap plastic.The only advantage is that it's cheap."
1,I felt ripped off.,"I felt ripped off because when it arrived it has no UK plug but to thin metal prongs...for Morrococo or something. Plus.it doesnt run on Batteries because they are for emergency back up.When I searched for the purchased Clock to complain it had dissapeared off my Purchase list............then I get this message to Rate it.I dont know how, but I want my money back on this."
2,I misunderstood,"I thought that this clock is working with only a battery, but it need electricity.I am so sorry I can't use it on foreign travel because there are 200 volt-use.Neverthless, it is very tiny and cute."
1,Won't keep correct time,I should have believed the negative reviews. This clock wouldn't keep correct time. Returning it would cost me time and money with no likelihood of being satisfied with a replacement. I'm writing it off as lost money.
4,Won't ever be able to say you didn't see the time...,"This clock is being used in the bedroom and the green LED is a lot brighter then I had originally thought it would be. Turning it a little did the trick, but other then that the clock is great."
4,Works fine,It works fine.Requires battery to avoid setting time and alarm again after cord is disconnected.Display is nice and big and alarm sound is adequate.
4,Has not failed me so far.,"I have been using this alarm clock for about 3 weeks now. The alarm is nice and clear, it has not failed to wake me up yet. I am pleased with the quality vs the price as I expected it to be more flimsy. All in all if you need to purchase a cheap alarm clock you can count on this is the product I would recommend."
3,Editorial Review,"Bringing to life the lovable and high-spirited characters that inhabit the world of the Little People, this christmas video from Fisher-Price is a great way to introduce your child to the spirit of cooperation and giving that surrounds the holiday season. Rendered beautifully in colorful Claymation, the 25-minute video consists of five separate stories, each featuring a different Little People character as they discover the real magic of Christmas. Joining familiar Little People characters Eddie, Maggie, Sarah Lynn, Michael, and Sonya Lee, Santa Claus himself makes an appearance in the video as he teaches one of the Little People about the joy that comes from giving. Accompanied by soothing music and a playful soundtrack, the video is suitable for children ages 1.5 years and older. --Chris Burns"
5,A GOOD BOOK TO USE ALONGSIDE CLIFF NOTES,I used this book because of the pictures and information about the plays. I read the actual Shakespeare play and Cliff Notes along with this book and got a very good idea of the plays so that I could intelligently see a Shakespeare play and understand what was taking place. I highly recommend it. It helped bring it to life in my mind.
4,Essential for Shakespeare,"These days it is hard to read Shakespeare without some sort of support reading, a companion to help make the reading clearer. This book does that as well as discuss Shakespeare's life and works in accurate, or as accurate as it can be, detail. I used this book to do a small research paper on Shakespeare. I had several other sources and this book had all of that information plus some. The matierial presented in ""Essential Shakespeare Handbook"" is often interesting facts that make reading it fun. This book is a good companion book to have with you while reading Shakespeare. I have read more thorough guides to Shakespeare, but this one ranks high on my list."
2,"This isn't the one you want, if you want accuracy","This is a beautifully shiny, glossy, pretty book which will briefly catch the attention of many children, but it isn't really a trustworthy reference book on its subject -- it creates a general, hyped-up, feel-good impression, but lots of the 'facts' it touts aren't really established, and it never lets on which of its contents are based on proper evidence (and if so, which evidence) and which aren't, nor which of the pictures are authentic and which just happened to be out of copyright. This may be OK for the 5th graders who'll be given it for Christmas, but if you really want to know about Shakespeare and his times and everything that posterity has done with him you want a grown-up reference book like the Bedford Guide or the Oxford Companion."
3,A Boy No More,"I think that this book didn't have very much action in it. It was all about Adam's friend, Davi Mori. There wasn't much to it. All that happened was Adam traveling around to get to Davi and his family to check and make sure he is all right. Other than that, it was a good book. Adam caring for his friend was a good thing. He traveled, while disobeying his mother, to get to Davi. Their friendship was great. They got ideas, shared them with each other, and wrote to each other whenever they could. I liked the part where Adam was riding on a train with a person who was in the navy. It must be interesting to be in the navy. Those two talked as they got closer and closer to where they both needed to go. This book is more serious because Adam is becoming a man, but I liked the first book, ""A Boy At War"", better because there was more action."
2,A Boy No More,"The reason why I rated this book a two is because it jumps from day to day so fast. I couldn't tell where I was. Another reason is the main character was not believeable. He would do things that teenagers wouldn't do. He went on a train for two days. I thought that it was going to have a little action, but it was nothing like the first book. The first book had Pearl Harbor in it. I thought the second have another important battle/event of World War II. Over all this book stinks, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
4,Floyd Cramer Pop Classics Vol 1,"For those of us who enjoy the loconic style of Floyd Cramer, this is another of his beautiful to listen to and enjoy CDs. His style is unique, with expression and variation not found with any other pianist. The track which is my favourite on this CD is 'My Cup Runneth Over'. It combines beautifully with the orchestral backing and has enough of his signature slipnote style for you to always be aware that it is the Master of Popular Piano Style. Relax and enjoy. Heather."
3,Updated Review,"Update - 1-8-2010 -- There is a way to use this so that it is somewhat effective. One needs to turn it on about an hour before needing it. If the panel is located under your desk, so that it's in a relatively enclosed area, and if it's allowed to heat the air there for an hour or so, it does indeed help with the chill. It's not great, but it is a help. I would now give it three stars rather than the two of the first review.-----I should have paid more attention to J. Tunnell's review. It is spot on. This panel delivers very little heat. I once had a panel that delivered more and assumed this one would be similar. So read J. Tunnell's review at least twice. Believe it. If you then order this, you've only yourself to blame."
2,Cozy legs heater more like cozy used heater,"I give this product 2 stars because it was sold as new and was obviouly a return, the two sided tape was torn and most of it was missing, it was scratched and no doubt had been used. It works and the person I bought it for says it works just fine. I would be hard pressed to make another purchase from this vendor."
1,radient heater,Didn't generate much heat. Hard to position and keep in place to be of any use. Sorry I bought it.
1,Do not buy from Ace Hardware!,"I ordered a new one from Ace hardware, but instead they shipped me a used one. A damaged used one. The back of the unit was almost falling off. There was paperwork accompanying it from the previous purchaser stating that they had received it damaged, but they just shipped it out again anyway, and claiming it was new! Overall, the absolute WORST experience I have ever had shopping online thus far."
3,Works,"Although the heat panel works, it doesn't emit much heat.. If the area is drafty, the moving air would/will take your heat away. If you have a desk sealed on three sides, it would work best. It would be much better than a space heater in that instance."
1,TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!,"I really needed this product at the time I ordered it for a very ill bird. The product has NO packing materials inside the box to protect it against damage, and on top of that, the product was NOT placed into an outer protective package; the company just stuck a label on the actual product box! Needless to say, it arrived in terrible condition, banged up and bent, and it would not even get warm when plugged in so it was completely unuseable. I returned it and did not ask for a replacement."
1,Not Impressed,"This did nothing to keep my legs warm under my desk. I actually received two for Christmas, and neither kept me warm. I mounted one on the desk and the other on the stand. I was very disappointed.I do live in the Upper Midwest and my office is in the basement, but I thought I would get some relief from the chilly air."
1,Frozy legs -- it's for the birds,"Cozy Legs is a tidy, lightweight panel that produced no perceptible heat at a distance of 12-inches. It was placed under a built-in desk that is completely enclosed on five sides (left, right, back, top, and floor). This was the ideal situation for the panel to show its effectiveness. It is simply too underpowered.Some raters liked the panel as a heater for their pet birds. It may be suitable for that, if you can get it right up against the cage and the ambient room temperature is within a couple of degrees of what's ideal for the birds.Lastly, for some odd reason, Amazon shipped this item in a box that was large enough to hold two dozen panels. Was this to discourage sending the wimpy warmer back? This was an expensive learning experience."
3,It's okay,"I use mine in a fairly enclosed under-desk situation and the panel is no more than 16"" from my legs. I can rarely feel the heat itself, but it does seem to keep my legs and feet a bit warmer."
2,"cozy feet, not very much heat","Doesn't even heat the wires on the bird cage, only 2 inches from the cage.For the $$$ not worth it. First one didn't even work. Thery did replace with free shipping, but the turn around took about 3 weeks."
2,not very good,"The idea is good. The heater seems to be well made. The amont of heat is real poor. If you could stand on it, it would work real well. This is not the case. mounted under a desk it puts out as much heat as a light bulb. Who wants to cuddle a light bulb to stay warm? Now take that light bulb heat & spreat it out."
2,barely heats up.,Bought this for a small bathroom thinking it might help take the chill off a 3 x 4 bathroom. No dice. Seems like it may work if you put your feet about 6 inches from it. oh well.
4,A decent kotatsu heater alternative,"Pros: It makes a cozy space under a kotatsu table. It won't burn you if you touch it directly for a while (accidentally). It fits under a kotatsu table. If you suffer from a wrinkly bottom quilt, you can use this thing as an iron and very, very, very slowly get the creases out.Cons: It's very hard to suspend on the underneath of a kotatsu. You can't adjust the temperature!Other thoughts: You really can't use it to heat part of a room; this is more like an upgrade to pocket warmers than a room heater. The cord isn't very long, so the kotatsu will need to be close to a wall. It's an awkward shape, and oh my goodness is it huge. It's also quite heavy."
2,Barely puts out heat,"It delivers what is advertised, but few people (including myself) actually realize how much heat 100W is.It basically takes a 100W light bulb and spreads the energy across a 3x2 ft panel. It will raise the temp under your desk a degree or two, but if you are expecting ""radiant"" heat, you need to look elsewhere."
2,doesn't provide enough warmth to help.,"I thought this would be perfect for my office, which is always kept freezing cold. However, while it fits great under desk, low voltage etc, and the panel itself is warm, you can't feel any heat unless you are physically touching it. with it's feet it doesn't sit high enough to slide your feet underneath so your legs can actually be within an inch of the panel, I've raised it up on boxes on either side, so my feet can partially fit under, but still I freeze at work all day. not satisfied."
2,not so radiant heater,"I bought this heater to heat my lovebird, without using a lot of energy or creating a fire hazard. In order for my bird to be warmed by it, it would have had to be within an inch of the heater, or pressed up against it."
2,"""Wall- or desk-mountable"" they say - Then they send you a couple of sticky velcro for that",There is not hole or anything on the back of that panel to hold it on a wall/desk other than with that pair of sticky velcro they send along with the package.No safety feature.It actually burns if you have to grab it with your hands or if it falls on bare legs.
3,ok,Works like it's supossed to but needs to be very close to your body or in a small space like under your desk.
4,Cozy Legs,"The product functions as intended and is good for those who do not have the wattage to run a heater with a blower. Users tend to prefer the air moving the heat across them, rather than the radiant. However, the fact this will not start fires and is better for the electrical grid is highly significant."
4,Enjoyable story about the Roman conquest of Britain,"""When the Eagle Hunts"" is the third novel in the ""Cato and Macro"" series of novels, which are set in the period of the Roman conquest of Britain. In this novel, the reader becomes more acquainted with the Britons who act as both adversary and, in some cases, ally to the Romans. In this story the family of a Roman General has been abducted by the Druids, the high priests of the Britons and implacable enemies of Rome. The protagonists, Cato and Macro, team up with a pair of Britons who are allies of Rome, in order to try to find and if possible rescue the general's family. This all makes for a very readable and enjoyable story. Young Cato continues to mature and come of age, while the grizzled experienced Centurion Macro acts as mentor and shows us how things would be perceived through the eyes of a seasoned Roman Centurion.This is a very engrossing and enjoyable novel. RJB."
5,When the Eagle Hunts,Was Simon Scarrow in Britain in the early 1st century? Did he know these guys? Seems like it. Loved it. Did you know the archaeoligist dug up a guy at Maiden Castle the was nailed by a roman bolt thrower?
4,I love this series.,"I got sucked into this series from the first, and all you can do is avoid starting. The chararacters are pals after the first books."
3,Decent Sequel,"I read the first 2 books in the Eagle series, and was quite impressed. Although this book is better than most historical fiction out there, it just doesn't hold up to the first 2 books. Sure, the secret rescue mission that Cato and Macro went on was interesting, but there wasn't any political backstabbing and plot twists that kept me interested in the first 2 books. Maybe the next in the series will be different."
5,Should be read through as a story,"The poems seem to form a continuous narrative telling the beginning and end of a love affair. If you took away the line breaks it would be a readable story. In fact I think Williams has previously written ""poems"" that are continuous blocks and is interested in pushing the edge of prose. Anglicisms, such as silver paper and day return and local London references add obscurity for an American reader and detract from an apparent intent to avoid poetic language. For example Trivia is about the way small things can hurt that remind of a lost love. Francis Thompson wrote ""the scent of the rose is bitter to him that loved the rose"" but Williams wants to avoid things like roses so he brings in names that sound (I think) prosaic and everyday to an English reader."
5,Best I've ever used - you will judge all others by these in in the future,"My new go-to cotton round for - everything. Never thought I'd rave about cotton pads.They're made of tightly woven cotton fabric then stuffed with fill and sealed edges, much like a small pillow.Strong enough to wring out & rinse face with after washing. Leaves no fibers on lashes or face when using with makeup remover or liquid cleanser and water.6 pack of 80 ea came packed in femininely decorated cardboard box with hand-cutout on top. Each tube has zip type resealer. I immediately shared 2 tubes with my mother and daughter - they are so good you want to share.Totally cute way to store the extras until you use them.The quality of the product makes up for paying for shipping. I have looked for these since and can't find them locally, so I'll be stocking up. They are so good I'm thinking of getting them for Christmas gifts...seriously."
2,Doesn't move,This toy does not move on carpet & barely on hard flooring. The music is extremely loud with NO volume control.Don't waste your money.
1,Extremely loud!,"This toy is so loud, it hurts my ears, let alone my kid's. I would not be surprised at all if it contributed to hearing loss. There is no way to adjust the sound, either."
4,Great toy,"This was a great toy for us. It doesn't bounce, but vibrates and moves. It ""crawls"" across the hard wood floor, area rugs and our berber carpet, but not the plush carpet (only in one direction). It plays music and vibrates/crawls. The kids love it. I point it at them and press the button and it ""chases"" them - they think it is hilarious. My daughter got it at about 3 months of age and she is now 4.5. Now it's not a favorite (at 4.5), but she still likes it. My son (who is 2) also likes it."
5,A Gift for my mother,"I didn't buy this for me but I knew my mother would like it. She loves good R&B; music like Luther Vandross and anything on the smooth jazz stations. It was perfect for her tastes. She put it on in her car and was happy.The brother's voice is so smooth and mellow. I have his ""Moods"" CD and, oh, yes! Will = smooth. His voice reminds me of warm chocolate. Smooth, rich and dark. You know what I'm talking about."
2,Does not work with Windos 7 Ultimate,The DVD Rom did not install on Windows 7 Ultimate and I had to ask for technical support which I found very humble but could provide me with a work around the problem to solve it. I had to explore the content of the folders of the DVD Rom and select a PDF file which works as what you can call a sub program. Something which I did not like very much.
2,Better than forever on ps!,Its better than that other game that came out on the ps a few years back.Grapchics-6/10-to choppyControl-2/10 terrible-u will notice this while trying to kill the joker!Fun factor-4/10 to boring and hardPresenatation-9.5/10 good story balance and good cut scenes.gameplay-4.8/10 to borrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrring!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Terrible pitilful game,"This game stinks on all 3 systems (4 if you count GBA). There is more jumping around than fighting. And the fighting is just punching. So the whole game is jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, punch, punch, punch, jump, jump, etc. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"
1,Aggrivating....,"If you want a game that's fun, buy something else. The controls make this game super frustrating."
1,The worst game on the box,This game is the worst game I ever seen on any of the next generation consoles if you have to have this game than get it for the PS2 or Gamecube. The control is horrible and the cut screens are way to long plus you can't skip them. If you want a solid game for your Xbox take Halo.
1,DONT BUY THIS GAME!!,"Dont buy this game I used to have it for Xbox and it stinks I wouldnt buy this for a dog!! The graphics are so bad that you can see his body go through walls they look like N64 graphics (no offense to Nintendo), the controls are horribble, the storyline stinks, there is sooo many glitches and it's waaaay too easy! I dont even know why they made it for Xbox, PS2, GC, and GBA. Get HALO or Spider-man NOT Batman Vengeance!!"
1,Stupid Game,"This is a stupid game, trust me. If you think you'll love it, rent it first because I am confident that you won't."
2,This game could have been great ...,"This game could have been great ... but it turned out awful ...Rather than have a great 3rd person action-fighter, you have an acrobatic puzzle solver with some 3rd person fighting ...What they should have done was to make the game more action oriented and to make the wire/puzzle solving with easier aim ...Rather than having to point directly at the standing target, to point in the direction, and for the CPU to make the automatic adjustment ...Also I've never seen Batman fall from a rooftop, but in this game, if you fall - you die ... with no chance of recovery ...That was a huge mistake ... had they made the game based on what Batman could do in either the cartoon series or the comics,the game would have been a spectacular success ... oh well ..."
2,Batman????,"Reccently i recived this game for free at my local gaming store. This game is just plain off weakVery little action, Extremely easy to beat, a million glitches (everywhere in the game u can see through walls)This game does provide some neat things such as the car chace and the helicopter ride. Put after a minute i see the same room and design over and over agian.FMV parts are ""ok""Basically the company used the name Batman to attract people and put out such a horrible game on Xbox,Ps2,GC,GBA.THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH [price] don't even go rent it u will be extremely upset."
1,Watch the cartoon instead!!!!,"This is not a good game at all. The graphics are Sega Genesis quality and the gameplay is terrible. Batman has good hand to hand skills, but can only use certain weapons in certain situations. I rented it for 5 days and played it about a total of 45 minutes in those 5 days. Save your money and get something else. This game is horrible!!!"
3,Ok,"If you like batman, this game is tolerable. Actually, it could have been a really good game but the way you controlled the fighting was one of the worst I've seen. The fighting in the game got so annoying at some points I would just run away from the bad guys."
4,A good read,"Dougherty spins a good yarn. His stories reflect a real understanding of and sympathy for the people who inhabit a complex and troubled part of the world. The persons who live in these stories are caught in the grip of historical forces beyond their control, and with the practiced eye of a professional who lived through these tragic events, the author tells the tales with the authority of one who has been there. A good read."
1,a rip off!,Too much money for such a short typical dvd!! I was shocked that I paid 18.00 plus shipping for a 10 minute dvd. Very standard sit up moves. Nothing new and challenging
5,"Excellent, insightful read for people on either side of the ""fence!""","Ann Albers is an incredibly talented teacher, psychic, author and person. She is a personal friend of mine and a colleague - we have taught psychic development workshops together, and have referred clients back and forth for many years. It is a delight to know her, and to see her expressing her gifts and wisdom so eloquently through this wonderful book. This is a great way to help those steeped in one school of thought open up to realize that truly, we are all part of the One. God bless you, Ann...write on!"
3,time for an upgrade,"Undoubtedly, this is one of the best reference book re modern furniture on the market place. Having said that, the readers should be aware that this edition is 4 years old. Some of the modern furnitures listed have since become modern classics & many important pieces after 1996 are not listed in here. For example, the working chair produced by Steelcase that is comparable with Aeron chair without its high price tag, Solo sofa by Antonio Citterio for B&B Italia, Vitra & Kartell ranges by Philippe Starck, more lightings by Ingo Maurer & the list could go on & on. Moreover, the authors could include pertinent website & e-mail address for suppliers & manufacturers on top of the snail mail addresses that were provided. It also would be more attractive if the book is printed in colour. Overall, it remains a substantial book. PS: Has the author ever considered updating the book online?"
1,Disappointed,"I barely finished reading this book. I read it only because hey I did spend money on it.The book is boring, unrealistic at all, and did not move me at all.Seems to me the words the characters spoke were forced and meaningless. The characters themselves were boring. She was too annoying and he was not male enough for me (now i do know its only a book but still) The transition from one point to another is very swift which I personally did not like.Save your money and time and buy something else."
5,Very good!,This is so much fun! My 10 yr old absolutely loved it. It was interesting for me as well. Great directions included
3,Not exactly like it use to smell,NOT like I remembered the scent and wouldn't buy it again. Don't know if it is the company the way they are making it now or what.
3,A decent fluffy read,"This book hooked me in the beginning, but then gave away all the secrets before it was half over. Then the action stops as the characters all get clued in. Not much happens after that, but I would give bonus points for a nice, wrapped-up ending (I just hate it when writers think they're being clever by ending the book three chapters too soon!).That said, I really loved the punchy-but-descriptive prose style of the writing. Add some stronger plot development and in future stories, and this could be a really good novelist."
4,Very touching story!,I love coming of age books & this one is great. Poor Kayla is full of questions about the mysteries that seem to surround her family & she is constantly seeking answers...some answers she doesn't really know how to cope with; like finding out that her new neighbor may be a half brother about the same age she is. Living with a mother teetering on the edge of insanity & a dad that seems to want to hide from the truth is not an easy thing for a young girl reaching adolescence. I enjoyed all the quirky southern characters that Kayla meets along her way of discovery. Very good book.
4,South of Reason...,"This was a really good book. I only gave it 4 stars because some of it was a bit dragging, but overall it held my interest. It's about the slow deterioration of one south Texan family, and one awful summer for a 12 year old girl, Kayla, and her thirteen year old neighbor Charles Dale. They find out the truth about the secrets their parents have been keeping for 12+ years, and deal with the shattering consequences they bring to both families.This was a very sad book, but at the same time a pleasant one. Kayla really grows up this particular summer, and even though the ending isn't what most of us would like to see, it was what was best for everyone. And by the end of the novel, Kayla also understands this. I would definitely recommend this book. I didn't think it was a real fast paced gripping tale, I took my time with it, but it was one that I really enjoyed. I'll be looking out for more books by this author."
2,good book to read before bed,"I was literally dozing off while reading this book. It goes nowhere. Would have been more interesting if there was a big, explosive secret exposed near the end."
3,Too many words -- too little plot,"Scintilating similes and superfluous fluff sometimes becloud anobsure, sometimes non-extant, story line. The author has an excellent writing style, not that of a first time author, but herweak plot cannot do justice to the entire undertaking. I would like to see her tackle a solid story line -- from the beginning -- and be able to marvel at the masterpiece I think she is capable of creating. This effort falls short of that goal, but is a decent and worthy piece of writing. Her characterizations and descriptions of Cameron, TX are inexact and distorted, but who'd know but a native like me?"
5,Read before you Breed,Read this book BEFORE starting your breeding program and you will save both your heart and your check book
5,Fabulous fantasy!,"Fantasy fans and especially cat lovers won't want to miss this wonderful series set on the world of Methuen, where justice is maintained by ""Seekers"": humans lifebonded to a sentient feline species. Seeker Doyce tries to overcome dreadful loss with her Bondmate Khar, but danger dogs her steps as a sinister figure from her tragic past threatens not only Doyce's future but that of the Seekers. MEOW! Destined to thrill!"
5,A must read for animal/scifi/fantasy lovers!!,"I originally bought this book because of the cat on the cover. (I had just finished reading ""Tailchaser's Song"", ""The Wild Road"", and ""Book of Night With Moon"" and needed another cat-related fantasy book, and quick!) I am SO happy I found this book. I read the trilogy within a matter of weeks and was ecstatic to find ""Sunderlies Seeking"" on the shelf soon thereafter. I strongly recommend this series to anyone who loves fantasy fiction, especially if they are an animal lover as well. The characters, both human and Ghatti alike are all knowable and memorable. The series is full of suspense, adventure, laughter, sadness and I am sure most readers, like myself, didn't want them to end. Greeno really weaves the reader into the world of Methuen and it is hard to leave. I am anxiously awaiting Book Two of Ghatten's Gambit!"
3,I want one of these cats.,"I almost gave it four stars, and then bumped it back down to three. It's a good book; been a while since I read it, though, and my memory's given it a better look after having read the books following. It's not amazing, and it can be slow, and towards the end, becomes fairly confusing, but it's still an enjoyable read. There are parts I thought could have been done better, and parts that I would have loved to have seen explored more, but overall it's a nifty world that drew me back to read the rest of the series and love them. Aye, it's obviously modeled after Pern, but good regardless-- if I had to choose between them, I think this'd be my favorite of the two."
3,Enjoyable but very reminiscent of Mercedes Lackey's books,Although I enjoyed this book I did at first find it a bit difficult to get into. It reminded me very much of Mercedes Lackey's books which was okay but I found it annoying as the writing was not as good as Misty's. Still I did get into the characters in the end and enjoyed it. Probably people who have not read Mercedes Lackey's books would enjoy it more.
3,Sloppy Port Makes This Wonderful Game Only 3 Stars,"SSX Tricky is by far one of the most fun games out there. The only problem is, EA put a sloppy port onto the Gamecube. Although fully capable of handling the game, there are numerous instances of gameplay interfering framerate hickups and. The game is still a buy, but if you own a PS2, get it for that system instead."
5,SAY WHAT!!!!!!,"This games is awesome. It is incredably unrealistic but that makes the game all the better. The fact that you can jump hundreds of feet in the air, lets you experience a impossible sensation. The game also lives up to its name. TRICKY TRICKY TRICKY is what the whole game is about. The race is cool but the showoff competition is great because you can bust HUGE AIR and HUGE TRICKS. The only flaw is that the two-player games could be more exciting. But that does not take away any of the fun because the one-player game is superior to all other snowboard or skateboard games."
5,The Best Game Ever,This is one of the best games I have ever played. The graphics are great and the game play is outstanding. The tricks that the characters. If you want a game for cube you got to get this game.
5,one of the best games i'v ever played,"this game is great. if u loved tony hawk, you'll love this game.wait until u get real good and start bustin some uber tricks at every jump. i recomend this game to all who loved tony hawk or some one who just wants to try something new"
1,It's too bad,"Everyone says that it's a great and an awesome game but, it's not really a great game at all! It has really good graphics, but that's all it's good for. When I first bought the game and got home, I thought it was awesome, but after 10 min. I was sooooooooooo bored from just going down montains after montains. I'm just trying to say it's not a game worth buy. And it's too bad."
4,SSX Tricky is the snoboard game to get,"I must admit, I was a little cautious before buying this game in fear that my hard earned money would go to waste but not so with SSX Tricky! I have never owned a snowboard games, or played one for a long time. But SSX Tricky very much appealed to me (must be there catchy "" It's tricky"" song they used to advertise. But The game is great! You get to have fun doing impossible moves and you really get into the game with it the games music. The character's are funny and you'll fall in love with each one very soon.I gave it 4 stars because the controls are difficult at first (i kept stumbling over the reset boarder button when i got excited doing freaky tricks) But you will learn and in minutes have alot of fun."
2,Worth 15 Bucks.,This game was only good for about a month then it turned sucky.BUY IT IF YOU WAN'T TO WASTE YOUR MONEY.
5,Game is Great I would recomemded it.,My grandson who is 9 years old loves it. But my grandson who is 6 1/2 years is still trying to learn how to do the tricks.If he keeps on practing he will get it too. The older brother loves it and loves to do tricks. I would recomemded this game.
5,This game rocks!,"I usally do not like sport games, but this game is different. I really don't like racing in tricky but the trick campaign is really great. It is really fun to play the multiplayer and verses your friends and to see who is the king. At first it is hard to do tricks, but after a little bit you will be riding like a pro. You get to build up your chacters and get them better boards, you can build up your trick level and your speed level and much more."
4,SSX- The Down Low,"I recently started playing SSXT on the Game Cube and absolutely loved it! The Graphics are outstanding, the characters are crazy, and the tracks are intense! Although my fave character is Kaori Nishadaki, I also like to play Elise Barns and Psymon Starks. (Talk about Crazy!) So I'd say two thumbs up, this game is a must for any age, gender, system, anything!"
3,"Great Play Value, but.....","I would echo most of the comments that other reviewers have made to-date. My only concern is what appears to be a buggy two-player mode. On three separate occasions, we had SSX Tricky lock up in two-player mode. The screen froze, and the audio made a large humming sound. Had to manually shut off the Gamecube, and restart the game.Eerily reminiscent of the type of experience one has come to expect with Microsoft Windows. We have never had this happen with 4+ years experience with our N64. To have it happen 3 times in one day with Gamecube is somewhat disconcerting. Believe this to be a software bug, as no similar lockups have occurred with Luigi's Mansion or Madden."
2,Not the best...,"I recently played this game, and I was not impressed. It was not the greatest thing I've played. Wait until 1080 2 for Gamecube."
5,Awesome,"This game is great. The controls aren't hard to learn, and once you learn them, there is an impossible number of variations to them. The game is fast paced, and the graphics are clear and very smooth. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a great game that won't get boring even after you've beaten it. This game is lots of fun and one of the best-ever games for any system. It has great graphics, responsive controls, and there are always more tricks to learn even after you've beaten it, and every character in the game has different tricks and variations!"
4,Awesome game,This game is pretty good once you get the hang of it take my advice. You get to go off jumps and do cool tricks. Oh and there's this thing called world circuit it's really fun you get to race against other people. Or you could do showoff and get high points. This is not a game that you will waste your money on.
1,This Game Sucks!,This game totally [stinks]. When I bought the game it was fun for about a week but now it has no point and it [stinks]. You dont want to buy this piece of [junk] game. If you want a good multiplayer action game buy super smash bros.
3,Fun,This game is fun and addictive but after 4 days of straight play u get sick of it if u have the money buy pikmin or thps3 cause ull like this game for about 4 days
1,WILL NOT CHARGE NEW IPODS :-(,"Apple screwed up and changed something, so that none of these existing speaker / charger systems will charge the latest ipod products. This unit, and other similar units from Bose and other expensive accessories, will NOT work with the iphone, touch, new nano, and probably other new devices.So much for apple's alleged ease of use and compatibility with their products."
3,Well written but bland,"I am not a big fan of the 1998 ""reimagining"" of Lost In Space. However I was curious to read this book and see if it captured either the flavor of the original show or the movie. I must say that the dialog patterns and charaterizations meshed perfectly with the movie take on the Robinsons and Dr. Smith. As I read the dialog I could hear Matt Leblanc and the rest of the cast in my head delivering the lines. The author did a great job here. However, the plot of the book left me a bit cold. It is basically a first contact story. There are many misunderstanding as the Robinsons meet members of an alien culture. That's about all that happens. If you want action you will have to look for it elsewhere. If you are a strong fan of the movie, this book is worth a read. If you prefer the original series and like action as opposed to philisophical debates, you can safely skip this book."
4,Interesting,"I thought it was interresting on how there was a differant piont of thinking. I never new the charitars from the old sieries , but I think I like how Penny never changes, from her laser eyes he,he, whell gotta go ,but this book was good anuff so that I would whant to know when the next one comes out so Ill see you there."
5,MVS JCL,"Excellent book for a beginner. Good explanations and examples very worthwhile for those starting with MVS JCL. THe book is easy to read, covers a wide range of MVS topics and areas."
4,fake train soars,"Unwound has been described by a friend of mine as a band closely following Sonic Youth's career, albeit in an even more sonic and dischordant manner. I completely disagree, but if he is right, this is Unwound's ""Daydream Nation"". There is brilliant writing here, and a great ""transcendant"" album--from minimalist post-punk to complex and full indie rock. Excuse me for the simplification here, but I find it to be generally true that some of the best albums are in-between styles (pavement being the best example), and this is no exception. This is great listening for a subway ride, a break-up, a cataclysmic natural disaster."
5,Great knife!,Awesome Case Knife! Perfect knife for every day carry. I like the way the blade pops into place when opening and closing. Buy with confidence!
3,Picture is Misleading,I ordered the product based upon the picture which shows a bone and brown handle. I received a brown knife. I had ordered due to the color - which is priced higher in stores. The brown knife I received was comparable to prices of the brown in the store - no big savings as it appeared.
5,An Absolute Grrl Riot Essential!,"If you are into that awesome,rough, grrl riot-y sound. You'll love H2B.But be warned, it is very violent and goth. I personaly wasn't expecting what I got but I was certainly pleased. I hope you are too."
5,Calculated,"Before growing up to be in Sleater-Kinney, Corin Tucker created a breathtaking masterpiece that is ""Calculated."" Stories of high school cliques, subtle and slow abuse, and the perils of waitressing have never been so hard, sharp, or poignant. The songs are structured perfectly; Corin uses her voice and lyrics to bring you into the dark world of Heavens to Betsy. It'll keep you up at nite."
3,Everybody needs to learn their craft somewhere,"For Corin Tucker, it was this lo-fi two-woman garage band (Tucker overdubbed a second guitar, and Tracy Sawyer played drums and bass). The faster numbers are pure punk, while others have soft-loud-soft structures. Tucker's lead vocals are visceral, the tunes have some cathartic power, and even the ones with long running times sustain themselves with unusual structure (""Complicated""). Often, though, the gentler songs, like the quietly determined ""Decide,"" are more successful than the abrasive ones (""Waitress Hell""). Frequently the lyrics leave a lot to be desired: most of the record is about Tucker coming to terms with her whiteness, which is an admirably weighty subject for an LP, but she repeats herself endlessly (the word ""privilege"" appears in at least five or six tunes), and doesn't really get beyond generalities. And the instrumental ""Intermission 247"" is an ordeal. A marginal purchase unless you're a huge fan of Sleater-Kinney and riot-grrrl punk."
4,Good Aviation read,"This book is worth the read. If you have ever considered flying on a long cross-country, just you and your airplane this is for you. It's set in the 1970's (1977) America. It's written by a female pilot but it's holds well for guys or gals. It's not deep into the technical parts of flying but is a story about people, places and the perspective of flying totally VFR coast to coast and back."
2,"from a fellow female airplane owner, I thought this was boring","It took all my strength to finish this book. I think the author has some very interesting stories, places, and people involved in this book. But the way it is written, I found it very boring. I read books about flying all the time. This has been the only one to bore me. When I saw it, I thought ""Wow! Finally a book written by a female airplane owner about her flying experiences!"" But it really was a disappointment. I forced myself to finish reading it because I kept thinking it would get more interesting. It didn't."
5,Destined to become a classic of light aviation - Wonderful!!,"I was so sorry when I had reached the last page!! This book is written with such clarity, such unjaded enthusiasm and love for flying that I was along with Marianna on each step of the coast to coast and back adventure!! I cringed and cowered at the dangerous parts - she took some real risks - not necessarily in the air!! I wanted to rescue the puppy!! If you are even remotely interested in light aircraft, this will whip up your enthusiasm - so take a break from your simulator and try a real simulator!! Enjoy!!"
4,An Enjoyable Journey,"Walk away from a less than perfect flight and the self-criticism can be paralyzing.Walk away from a successful flight and you're on top of the world.Why did I relate most to Gosnell's one and only paragraph in which she expresses her self-doubts and cries? Because that maybe best captures this spirit of aviation: to test yourself, your capabilities and limits, and to flourish. I'd like to believe a male aviator could write with such modesty.As in the cliche - It's not the destination, but the journey."
2,"Senseless, Meaningless, useless","Rodrigo D is suppose to represent a ""reality"" film before ""reality"" TV emerged as a common and popular viewing choice. We are to follow the daily routine of Rodrigo D, a very poor and angry young man, as he trys to understand where he is going and what he wants to be/do. Curously, Rodirgo is suppose to be a drummer in a Punk band. But we never see him play the drums. In fact, his best musical effort is purchasing a set of drum sticks for 150 pesos...about $0.08.Rodrigo, like the film, just drifts from place to place, moment to moment...mostly arguing, fighting, yelling and lieing his way about town. Along the way he steals some things, meets some friends, and they get killed, In the end, of course, he lives and the film ends.Senseless, meaningless, useless...Rodrigo D goes no where...just like his film. Those who may have been killed duringthis filming, or shortly thereafter, arethe lucky one."
5,Punk...Money...Problems,"I'll say that the first time i saw this movie i was 16. I am honest saying that at that time i didn't like it. I was expecting something different and at that time the movie industry in colombia was in its beginning so i expected to see something more like a hollywood movie on those days.As the years gone by i found this dvd on amazon and decided to purchase it. Well....now it's different. Now i understand the movie a little bit more but it's still confussing. But there's something really clear now...this is a great movie if you watch it as a documentary of the life in Medellin at 90's.The apathy of this teenager, who become a great colombian actor afterwards Ramiro Meneses, and his dream to start a punk band, with no talent, except the one of waving the drum sticks on the air, makes you feel in a documentary movie the same as ones that you see about guys on the National Geographic Channel but with more non-sense violence and no future."
1,Great phone if you like static,"This phone has so much static it is nearly useless. What a piece of junk. The other features of the phone are fine, but what good are they when all you get out of the receiver is a loud roar. Buy this phone only if you don't want to be able to hear the other party."
5,Perfectly good replacement!,"I wasn't sure about getting a third party power adapter for my mom's laptop, but this has turned out to be great. Buy with confidence!"
4,Excellent Replacement Cord for a Fraction of the Apple Price,"This power cord works great. It doesn't get as hot as the Apple cord I replaced, and charges my computer with no problem. The only thing keeping this product from a 5 is the fact that they could have made it a bit longer but for about $25 you really can't go wrong. I have recommended this to many people and it really seems to be more durable than the original Apple cord. Very good product."
4,An excellent survey of a great institution,"Every track in this collection does justice to the great Kill Rock Stars label. Outstanding are the cuts by Tiger Trap, Slant 6, Mary Lou Lord (! ), and the uproriously funny CWA ('Only Straight Girls Wear Dresses').Sadly, no Elliott Smith here..."
5,This compilation record rates high in my cd-player,Stars Kill Rock has great songs such as HAIR and Only Straight Girls Wear Dresses that will get a person going at any time... :o)
5,Not as good as Twisted Metal II,"Great game and great story. Very fun to play but not as good as Twisted Metal II, ""In my opinion the best one out of the series."""
3,you probably want to rent this before you buy,"this game is ok. the graphics are ok, but the cars look like crooked polygons. The controls are easy, but the weapons seem sluggish. also is a bit easy. one thing you will like is that they put the best cars from the series in there.they changed the specials on a few cars,(and modified some) but the new specials are pretty good.i like playing as sweet tooth, whose special was changed to an ice crean bar that slides around until it hits a car a few times. the levels are so-so, you will probably only like half of them. also, its a little more based towards the younger crowd, so it might seem a little kiddie to older people. all in all, an ok game, but you should rent first to see if you like it."
3,fun but not as playable or nice graphically as later games,"The game is fun and definitely novel, in terms of the battleground settings and mechanisms, but not as playable as TM games for PS2 or PS3. The controls are not as good, and you can't expect the graphics to be as good because it is a PS1 game."
5,Jacket for my boyfriend,My boyfriend said he wanted a waterproof jacket and since he likes dickies I purchased this jacket. It was way over what I expected and we both really liked the jacket.
4,Resolved,Nice job on resolving my problem. He was courteous and quick about everything.Now I'm a happy camper. Thanks for the concern. Was an unforseen problem and fixed very quick.
2,Description fails,"to mention that the arms are not lined at all. They are nylon inside and out and can be very uncomfortable in cool weather. The rest of the jacket is fine, but I just don't like descriptions that conveniently leave certain parts out."
3,Not a bad jacket but shell fabric is very thin,Overall a nice jacket for $20. Shell fabric is very thin but it is waterproof. Lining is also pretty thin but this is good for late spring early fall. Length of jacket was slightly too long.
3,Only Good For Light rain,"This is a nice mild weather jacket. Out in the rain yesterday that was not even near heavy and water seeped through in several spots. If you are looking for something for the rain....look on this will not cut it. It does have a generous fit as for-mentioned. I a bit warmer than a wind breaker. Nice looking. I just think ""water resistant"" should be taken out of the description as it is misleading."
4,Comfortable and good,"I purchased this jacket for two reasons, to go out the street in rainy days, whatever i'm going to work or somewhere else, and when i go travelling by bus since it's cold because of aircon. I haven't had a chance to test it in the rain, but it works just fine when i'm in the bus, it warms enough (not too hot/light) and the hood is useful to reduce external noise if you want to sleep or listen much better to your music player. It has an inside pocket at the left side, useful to put your music player or anything else, i wish it had a right-side pocket too, it would have been the fifth star."
3,"Comfortable windbreaker, Bad rain-jacket","Protects against rain about as well as a wet blanket. On one hand I don't have water beating on me, on the other it soaks through the jacket, the inside pocket, and neatly deposits all of it on on my legs. To be fair the leg part is likely a fault in all jackets but it was just the insult to injury on the already being wet in my allegedly waterproof jacket."
4,Good Coat,"The coat came just as it was getting cold and breezy here in TN. It has a nice fleec lining that came handy while I was fishing in my boat. It is not recommended for ""very cold weather"", but it is a very good ""cold"" weather jacket."
5,Great Jacket,"I love this jacket. It is lightweight but still warm enough to wear in all but the coldest weather. It is also long enough to cover my rear. Very good in the rain, too."
2,Not warm enough,"I thought the item would be a little more of a heavy weight , like an older one I had.It was not. Not Dickies fault, just not what I wanted."
4,"Dickie Men's Fleece Lined Hooded Jacket, Dark Navy, Large",The coat is just what my husband wanted but he wishes the liner was a little bit thicker. Received the coat very quickly.
2,misleading description,"Very misleading description-the hood and body are fleece-lined, but the sleeves are not. I especially wanted fleece-lined sleeves. It is water resistant as advertised."
4,coat,"Excellent jackets for all weather. In really cold Iowa winter, I put extra layer underneith.Light weight, but tough. Lined hood makes big difference in windy weather."
5,Great jacket,"I got this for my son who is 6'2 and weighs about 250. The coat fit great, he says it is very comfortable and warm. He loves the fleece lining. The price was very good too, I was pleased that he liked it (for once) and that I did not spend an arm and leg on a jacket ~ and it shipped quickly. I would buy again from vendor."
4,Eugene V. Debs--From Moderate to Radical--An Evolution,"The first section of this book is especially good, in that Ginger estahlishes the the moderate basis of Debs character. With this foundation, his evolution into a radical figure in American history is explained.A must for those interested in labor history, highly recommended for those interested in America's social history. An enjoyable read for those who like biography."
3,Gets Better,"This CD is definitly a new sound for the scientist, but it is out of control with its crazy alien sounds and sythesised effects. Some good ones though, but if you are new to the scientist, I would recomend the Evil Vampire CD over this one any day of the week."
2,Just a Travelogue,"If the author didn't tell you the two of them went by bike, you might not know it. This is pure travelogue."
2,Pass,"Ready Bicycle Journeys with Jerry instead, or read the first couple chapters and you get the idea for the rest."
2,Needs work,"Reading about this womans adventures was like listening to a senior citizen babble about her life. Every page is the same as the one before: Day 45 Today I had ham and eggs for breakfast, then we rode thiry miles. It was so hot. Then we found a place to sleep. Day 46 Today we had toast and eggs for breakfast then we rode for thirty three miles...and on and on and on.There are no characters in the book. Even her husband who accompanies her is forgetable. There is nothing in the book that made me want to finish it - no struggles, no obsticles to overcome. She is not searching for herself or writing about whatever her mind wanders onto while she peddles all day.It is a day by day account of how far she rode, what she ate, where she slept and riding conditions. She is probably an interesting lady and she probably has an interesting story to tell but the technical details of her travel are ovewrwhelming and make the book unreadable."
3,Not Really Needed,This is not really needed as long as the device you are loading from has its own power sorce....
4,A wonderful introduction to hand tools,"I recieved this book for Christmas and just finished it. It is a great introduction to the use and care of hand tools. It has very informative and interesting side bars and is wonderfully illustrated. It blends the aesthetic with the practical very well. Just one hint: skip over the section on handplanes and just purchase Hack's ""Handplane book"" which is the definitive book on handplanes."
1,Why bother?,"This book is too small. It lists some free font sites but does not list some of the most popular ones, like apostrophic lab, greywolf webworks, gemfonts, blambot and a few others. Buy something else because this book is not worth it."
1,Which internet?,"Which internet are these people browsing? The internet I know shows apostrophiclab.com and blambot.com to be the most potent free font sites on the web, but they're not even mentioned in this book. What about the endless free offerings of Rich Gast and Graham Meade? Not in this book. I'm getting a refund, I hope."
1,Do not buy this tent,"This tent is poorly crafted and breaks easily. It rained while we were camping and not only did we get wet through the rain fly, but the floor actually had puddles of standing water. I have been unsuccessful in contacting the company that Amazon went through, CampingStation. They do not respond to email and you cannot call them."
1,Awful tent,"This is a terrible tent!! The only thing it has going for it is that it's very big. We have a family of 5 and we were more than comfortable in the tent with all of our gear and room to spare. However, it leaks-badly even in light rain, the support poles broke, the fly is a joke, the tent was extremely difficult to set up following the awful directions, it was very shaky even when set up properly. With a slight breeze, the entire tent looked like it was going to take off because the fly is not tied down to anything. Horrible, awful, crappy tent. DO NOT BUY!!! I contacted support because we only used it for 2 seasons and the poles broke. They suggested I send the entire tent in, at my expense, and they would evaluate it. Needless to say, it's now in the garbage, right where it belongs."
1,One Time Use,"Pros: Big-Lots of spaceCons: Weak poles for size tent,poles kept popping out of connecting pole,not enough support for tent, no instructions for tent, couldn't fit back in carring case.This tent is good for one time usage where there is no wind and/or rain."
3,Good,"It does not bring instructions of assembly, poor quality, but it is very spacious and fresh, good height."
1,What a rip off!!,"Three days ago I ordered 2 of this tent the cost for the tent at the time was $22.99 each. Today I received a email from Amazon stating my order was cancelled and charges was returned to my card, please contact Fogdog. I go back on the site now to see the same exact tent here for now $189.00. Think company Fogdog is very unprofessional and may even be a BIG CON!!!!"
4,A must-have for city Pagans,"Books about Paganism should be *more* than just spells, rituals, and tradition--and this book is definitely more! Without any condescension, Ms. Telesco manages to explore some pretty complicated topics (such as the psychology, ethics, and imagery of magick) in simplified yet meaningful ways. And that's just the first few chapters! With handy tips and lots of factual information, this book shows you how to blend both the art and science of magickal living."
3,great for beginners,I first read this book for myself when I had just found Wicca. After reading it I have to now say that it is simple and straight forward which I really appreciated at the time. Even now I recommend it to those among my friends who are just starting to look into new ways to incorporate neo-paganism into their eberyday lives.I think that for those who have already established their religion into their everyday lives that it is a little bit of an overkill.
3,Lightweight.,"I was disappointed in this book. I found very little of use for serious neopagans, but lots of loose, undefined philosophizing and sweeping generalizations. Beginners level, and low on the list"
2,Did not deliver as promised. *sigh*,"I thought that this book would talk about, and give ideas for, a Witch practicing and living in a city environment. But, it didn't and I was severely disappointed."
3,What can you say about metal legs?,"I bought the Cozy Legs Radiant Heater Panel and thought that these metal legs were required. Quite frankly, while they work, they really aren't that much of an improvement over what came with the Heater Panel.Still, they do and adequate job, and they are a tiny bit more aestetically pleasing than the included 'legs.'My advice - buy these only after you try the included legs."
5,Holding Radiant Heater,Can't complain here. The radiant heater sits nicely in it and it is sturdy enough to hold the unit securely.
4,nice fit,the fit of the rack to the flat panel heater is good and holds the panel in a solid fashion
3,Metal Stand is Okay,"This product should be included with the panel heater. Since I had to buy it separately, then I recommend that it have wheels with locks so that it's easier to move the heater."
3,Not needed,This stand is almost the same as what comes with the http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013V39J4/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title cozy legs panel. We did not need the extra stand.
5,Simplicity,If you purchase the Cozy Legs you will find that the supplied stand is very akward. The stand included with the Cozy Legs requires tools and has to be adjusted just right for it to work well. This stand is exceedingly simple and should be what is included with the heater. Save yourself and others a lot of frustration and buy the stand.
1,Waste of money,"Three points about this video (Where the Rich and Famous Dwell):FIRST, This extremely low budget DVD has poor color and picture quality. In most cases it is filmed in black and white because the camera pans in-out on photographs, while the narrator describes the symbols or buildings we're looking at.SECOND, Some of the content presented to the viewer is speculative or, in the narrator's opinion questionable (example: ""...could this be..?"").THIRD, The hum-drum distasteful and boring same old one-line music score that plays in the back-ground thru-out the video is so obnoxious and annoying it distracts the verbal message the producer is trying to convey.FINALLY, Don't waste your money on this piece of junk; instead, by a good in-color book about the illuminati subject matter, or spend your twenty-five bucks on a better produced (authored) DVD."
3,"As with most of Texe stuff, flawed, but still worth a look.","Poor old Texe Marrs looks like he's gainedsay, 78 lbs., since the last time we sawhim. Put him on a diet, Wanda! This video-de-Force shows wome of the royla digs of theRockefellers, Astors, Rothschilds, et, al.It's what you would expect from the highmuckity-mucks! From the video back coverblurb: ""Discover the dark secrets of thelifestyles of the Illuminati rich and famousas you visit and peek at their Luxurioushomes and mansions..."" Too bad it doesn'tmean anything about our future and glad theBiblical Prpheies have all been fulfilledby our savior, Jesus Christ. Relax Texe,God didn't like the New World Odor back inthe days of the Tower of Babel, I don't thinkhe's changed his mind since!"
3,Not a gift item,"I purchased this as a gift for a student going away to college. The fabric is much much thinner than I thought it would be. I haven't decided if I'll still give it as a gift. The set is Ok for myself, maybe as a guest towel, but not to give as a gift."
5,Colorful bunch,"British royal family was always a colorful bunch. In comparisson with their ancestors, today's Windsors are a pretty tame group. Prince Eddie, the grandson of Queen Victoria was very often a subject of speculation and rumor. Some even suspected him of being Jack the Ripper. In this fictional account, the untimely death of Prince Eddy is not influenza but murder. Is it truth or not nobody realy knows anymore, but it is quite possible.The first in a series of novels featuring Lord Francis Powercourt is a very good read. Mix of facts and fiction makes a very pleasent dish.Very enjoyable."
1,Couldn't finish it,"I badly wanted to like this book since the author has written so many of them. It would have opened up a new world of books for me.Unfortunately, I couldn't even get as far as the murder, the book being so boring. The stilted language was just one facet; the cliched characters another. The biggest reason, though, was it was just so dull."
2,Difficult to assemble,"My son is pretty good with more complex models, but he found that the pieces of this helicopter did not fit together properly. So, it seems to be of inferior quality--at least the item that we received."
2,"Bizarre, yet boring","A sixth grade student of mine brought this book to me, as he had read it, and been somewhat disturbed by it. First off, let me say this is NOT a book that would interest kids under, say, 15.Then again, I doubt this book would interest anybody. The fact is, it's boring. There is no discernable arc to the story, simply a group of events and a late-breaking attempt at a plot. The dialogue is clumsy and long-winded. I found myself alternately disgusted and bored by the characters. All of them are difficult to sympathize with, but are not fleshed out enough to be unpleasant in the charming way of Catcher in the Rye or Confederacy of Dunces. The politics are also troubling, while the intention is obviously good, the execution makes all the characters distasteful.The author is a headmaster of a school in North Carolina, and I found myself wondering how his community reacted to this book. It is nothing short of bizarre."
1,Very Poor Transfer--Buy the Remastered DVD,"I should have gone with the Remastered DVD, as this DVD is worse than the one I made using my old VHS tape of Rock Rock Rock. Many scenes are so light and bleached out that you can't see the detail of the faces or clothes. Apparently an old, worn copy of the film was used for this DVD transfer. The music used is great as always, but I recommend you purchase the remastered version. It is almost twice as much as this version, but it would be worth seeing this film restored, especially with all the rock 'n roll acts featured on this film. The plot is silly and mindless, the acting stiff and wooden (especially by a young Tuesday Weld), but all this adds to the innocence and charm of this cult classic. It's a shame the picture quality is so poor."
3,Initial response,"I got this for my boyfriend for christmas, and he hasn't had alot of time to judge the product since it's been warm out, but these are his initial responses:Pro: Heats up his feet quickly and they stay warm.Cons: They can get uncomfortably hot if left on for too long. The strap to hold the batteries isn't uncomfortable or problematic, but it is inconvienent. Also, the shoe insert will slide backwards, so unless you want to adhere it to your shoe, it will become very irritating."
4,These are wonderful,"These foot warmers are wonderful. The only negative thing I can say is that the wires can be annoying, but once you have them on, you don't notice anything except for your warm toes. You can conveniently turn them on and off as needed. I get a solid 4-5 hours out of a set of rechargeable batteries. This is my first winter with them so I cannot say how durable they are, however even if I have to buy new ones every year--they are well worth it."
5,Great inexpensive solution to cold feet,"These are an excellent option to keep your toes warm in the winter if you have poor circulation like me. They cost a bit more than the chemical warmers, but quickly become more economical since you can use them over and over. Unlike chemical warmers they keep working even when your footwear is basically airtight like many well-insulated boots.Runtime can also be as long as you want since you can switch batteries, but I get about 3 hrs on one set of batteries. They also take standard AA (including rechargeable) so you don't have to purchase expensive battery packs like some alternatives.They are best used in an already warm piece of footwear though. They don't get super hot, but I find them to be the perfect temp for helping with poor circulation on cold winter days."
1,Cozy feet gives me cold shoulder,"When I first plugged in my Cozy Feet I thought it was broken. There was simply no detectable warming. I bought another one hoping it was just a lemon. But the second one was the same way. After trying it several times I finally detected a faint, and I do mean faint, warming of the pad. I had to hold it in my hand as I plugged it in. Only then could I detect a change in temperature. I kept one and returned one. I've installed them in my ski boots. I have very low expectations when I finally hit the slopes."
1,"Wire housing split open, shorted out against my leg. Lost some hair.","First time I wore these hunting, the wire on the left one split open and shorted out. I noticed a burning against my leg, and realized the battery pack was getting extremely hot. Took a few moments to access the unit to turn it off. Rechargeable batteries have expanded slightly and the wrapping on them is split.Sent back for refund. Also, the insoles only get slightly warm, doesn't help when the ambient temperature is below 20. Going to stick with hand warmers in each boot."
2,needs improvement,"They thawed my feet just enough so that I feel the cold. Seriously, my feet felt better before I put them on. All they did was wake up my nerves to feel the bitter cold. I cannot send them back because they technically worked so I will probably attempt to increase the voltage which will require some work. I would not recommend these for sitting inactively in a cold humvee for long periods of time."
2,Didn't warm-up as I expected,"While waiting for my power & heat to return after Huricane Sandy, I thought this might serve to help keep my Chihuahua puppy warm (if I put them in a sock under her blanket), but they didn't warm-up much."
2,Dont,"Tryied to save some money, got what I payied for, never again, used one day, trashed same day, save your money."
1,Doesn't work.,The product didn't work. It didn't warm up at all. Disappointed and will purchase actual heated socks again. Sad it didn't work out.
4,Heated Insoles review,"Great product. especially for DIY guys.Very cheap and working system. It can be glued inside your shoe (I would say the best way). Wires look a little fragile but once installed (gently and properly) in ones could possibly last. If you want to put it in and out (I would not recommend), wires may tear of.I'm gonna use rechargeable batteries. NiCd should be the best choice to my opinion (RC airplane modeler)"
3,one worked one did not,"I bought two, the one that worked was nice. Helped keep the chill off. The other one did not work. The toe part is hard, no give, kind of odd. It is the cheapest foot warmer I could find and I have not tried pricier foot warmers. I would not reorder but Ill keep the working one. Hard to choose which foot to use it on."
3,It heats up,It dost last very long on 2 AA batteries but I have used it a few times I just don't like having to waste batteries or charge them they are to expensive to waste for the amount of heat that is produced
1,doesn't work,"waste of money. Only one of them works just a little, the other on does not work at all. replaced batteries two times, still doesn't work."
2,Didn't work!,"After reading the reviews I was skeptical about purchasing these insoles. I was willing to accept the ""cheap"" assemply and parts as long as the end result was worth it. Unfortunately, the insoles I received generated very little heat. The heat that was generated didn't warrant me to keep them. I was willing to try another set just in case mine was defective (and not the norm,) but they were out of stock. With that being said I have decided that I will look into other insoles that are on the market."
1,terrible product,this product does not get very warm.at most 40- 50 degrees. not very warm if your in a place that has snow like afghanistan.
1,Junk,The product worked one time. After the thin material inside gets walked on it breaks the circuit. One time use. Don't buy. It was a good idea and bad design.
3,feet heat,This product doen't put out any serious heat but I think it does enough to help keep your feet from freezing.
1,WASTE,these was the biggest waste of money ever. I should of jus lit the money on fire and stuck it in my boots!
1,Not strong enough!,On the second day of use the cable broke! It was ok as long as it worked. but it should have been made out of sturdier material!
2,Barely noticeable warmth. don't waste your $,"I can't even go outside when it's cold. My toes freeze. These things don't help at all.The wires hurt under your feet, the battery pack is VERY bulky around your ankles and the heaters are not even noticeable."
3,"FAIR quality, limited usage item","The item does work but it has a limited use. Based on the quality of the parts, the physical appearance of the product after a 15 minute use in the house with just walking around resulted in a very worn looking pad with some pull on the wires. I do not believe this item will survive very long in my heavy work boots. The pad was placed under the insole of a tennis shoe as indicated - I walked around my house for approx. 8-10 minutes, then sat in a chair as I observed the temperature settings/changes. When I removed my shoe, looked under the sole, the pad was slightly bunched, severely wrinkled, and the wires looked like they were being stretched.I purchased 2 sets - If they last a week a piece in my workboots this winter I will be surprised.Would not purchase again in the future. Not a bad product for a very short term use for someone who sits most of the time."
1,No heat !,I bought these foot warmers for my son who is handicapped and has cold feet all the time from being in a wheelchair. Sadly they don't work. When I tried them I didn't feel any heat at all so I have to give it a thumbs down.
2,Do not buy!,"It worked for about 10 min's at most then one of them never even turned on again (& I used fresh, brand new batteries). The one that 'did' stay on....did not warm my feet at all - they were still freezing cold. I was emabarassed having to pull them out of my shoes while out. Also, the retractable cord is extremely inefficient. I had to pull repeatedly to get the cord back in. Lastly, the retractable cord unit itself is a nuisance around your leg. Now I have to go through the bother of the whole return process. To say I am disappointed is an understatement."
1,"Eh, What happened?","Now, I'm not downing this man. Huge fan of the 1st CD... 2nd was okay. I've seen him live and he was hilarious, but this DVD is far from the top of his game. Only laughed at a few parts of the show. Maybe the main stream's bringing his game down, who knows, but I'm glad I got this as a gift and didn't pay for it."
5,hilarious,This stand-up is hilarious and has many classical jokes that can be told or heard in repeat. Dane Cook is awesome!
4,He Rocks =D,Dane cook as soooooo super awesome u guys!I definitely would recommend this to anyone into comedy =]
3,"By a round of aplause, how do you feel?","Dane Cook proves that a stand up comedian can get the same reactions from an audience as a rockstar. Great show, but those of you that don't live in the US should either get an American DVD-player, or just watch it on your computer."
2,Disappointing at best,"I have thoroughly enjoyed Dane Cook's stand up in the past which is why I chose this DVD. However, most of his jokes fell flat and weren't nearly as funny as his previous work. I would not recommend this DVD."
1,Whats wrong with you people?,"I've never understood why people think that dane is funny...he's not!!!. In fact, he's quite dull. A lot of his jokes are just stupid or they don't make any sense at all. I'm dissapointed with myself that I wasted my time with this dvd. I could have been doing something better with my time. Bottom line...dane cook sucks!!!!"
1,Heard Any Good Jokes Lately?,"I bet it wasn't hereI'm still trying to wrap my mind around just how people find this guy funny. I can't even force a laugh at this collection of day long monologues that go absolutely nowhere. There's nothing observant, entertaining, insightful, or even on par with the 'dead ant' Pink Panther joke that your parents bore you to tears with in your youth. And to my parents credit; they never once did that Zoolander-esque mug at the camera like he does after he finishes whatever abortion of Louis C.K's notebook that he's just finished. For Christ' sake; at least Gallagher had sight gags. I'm hoping with all the money that he's making from movies this year...that he can find a way to buy time. Because I certainly want what I wasted watching this back."
2,I guess I just don't get it,"I really wanted to love this. I love the way Dane Cook has harnessed the power of the internet to override the corporate version of funny. I had heard he was hysterical, the next great thing in comedy. But OMG. This is just not that funny. My 18 year son laughed a bit, even my 50 year husband laughed once. I thought it was unfunny, lame, derivative,and unworthy of a such a huge audience. But that's just my opinion. Obviously,I could be wrong. He sure is cute though."
3,Just okay.,"I wasn't satisfied with his DVD. I really wasn't I've seen him do stand up comedy before and he's usually hillarious. But I just wasn't impressed. He takes too much time to explain things. I didn't laugh as much as I thought I would. It was funny, but it was just okay."
1,Zero Stars,"Isn't a comedian supposed be funny? Isn't he supposed to tell jokes or at least funny stories? Dane Cook walks around the stage and ponitificates to an adoring audience in Boston, but the show isn't funny, elightening or original. He's clearly doing old material that the audience is familiar with and they play along willingly. Watching this show for 90 minutes is like listening to a long winded friend who thinks he's so funny that you can't help but be enthralled by his stories. His physical antics don't add anything special to the performance.Eddie Murphy's Delirious comes out on DVD in January. If you want to see how stand up comedy is supposed to be done, spend your money on that. It amazes me that someone this mediocre could have risen to this level of success, but there's no accounting for taste, I guess."
1,How does anyone find Dane Cook funny?,"Honestly, I do not know. If he didn't move erratically and jirate himself all around the stage, he wouldn't have a job. And his ""jokes"" take an inordinate amount of time to come to fruition, if you can even call it that. Seems that everyone I know absolutely loves him, and I honestly cannot figure out why...if you want a funny comedian with thoughtful, enciteful and actually FUNNY jokes, check out Lewis Black, or better yet, check out the man who Mr. Cook stole jokes from - Louis C.K."
4,"If you're a Dane fan, you'll like this....","This DVD is pretty good. His Harmful if Swallowed DVD is funnier, in my opinion. This makes a great gift for any Dane Cook fan."
4,"DANE IS FUNNY,BUT HE HAS BEEN FUNNIER!","This guy will never be a George Carlin or Richard Pryor,but he is a funny guy in a goofball kinda way. I thought the stuff on his first CD/DVD release was funnier than this one. It is still an entertaining bit."
2,Eh,"From when I first saw Cook's Comedy Central Presents years ago, all the way upto his latest album Retaliation I loved everything Dane Cook has done. I even found the Tourgasm series very funny, which a lot of people didn't seem to like. I was happy when I heard about Vicious Circle coming on HBO but when I watched it, I just didn't like it. I wanted to like it, but by the time he got to the actual joke after a long-drawn out, boring unrealistic story, it killed the joke for me. The crying bit was annoying, the ""B+E"" bit wasnt funny, everything about it just kind of annoyed me rather than made me laugh. The little things were funny which is why I gave this 2 stars, but I hope his next set of material is better, and if he does one hour shows rather than 90 minutes shows, hes probably better off cause he can cut out all the build-up."
3,good dvd,"I just bought this dvd today. I love Dane Cook, I can relate to some of his jokes. If you liked his Albums, you will love this dvd. Some of the jokes are better then others but oh well."
1,Lame,I have to agree Dane Cook is better than this I was excited to see he had an HBO special only to be let down.He has much funny stuff than this and him trying the whole rock star thing just made him look corny. If you want to see a truly great DVD by a comedian much like Dane well you need to give Brian Regan a shot.I hope Dane recovers because he can be funny.
5,Beyond hillarious!!!,Dane shows his full range of comedy throughout this entire DVD. You do NOT want to pass up the oppurtunity to see this.
1,Why can't I rate any lower?,"I honestly wish I could give this product a lower rating. Dane Cook is a horrible, un funny ""Comedian"" who has gotten famous from other people's work. He is like that guy you know that thinks he is funny, but is just annoying, if you like comedy, don't listen to Dane Cook, because he ruins comedy with his ""jokes"" and ""funny"" sound effects."
1,"All Hype, No Substance","This has to be the least funny stand up act ever. This guy is a product of pure hype. What is supposed to be funny about ""I'm gonna go home and cry""? What a sniveling idiot. These people who paid top dollar for this snooze-fest were probably convincing themselves to laugh out of some sense of denial. If I paid , I might as well laugh. No. I could find a funeral more amusing than this goober."
1,How long does it take to finish a joke?,"Ok, this was the first dvd I ever bought of his stand up and I was hugely disappointed. I thought this had the jokes from his cd, Retalation (if anyone knows where I can find a dvd version of this stand up, please tell me. I found that one funny), but I made a mistake and it didn't really bother me. I seen him a few years back (2003) on a cruise ship and he was funny. This dvd...is not. My only question is, how long does it take him to get to the point of a joke? I understand comedians telling stories and I like it, but it takes Cook almost 20 minutes to finish one joke. He jumps to other topics (Windextor?) that is almost related, but not that funny. The pace is too slow."
4,Good stuff,"This is a LOT of Dane Cook to handle, which is not a bad thing at all, it's just more than we are used to seeing of him at one time. So he tends to go off on subjects for a long time and usually with pretty funny results. I've been a big fan of dane ever since I first saw him on comedy central back in the late 90's and his material has continued to impress me. Of course it is constantly vulgar, constantly hilarious and pretty much what you can expect from a Dane HBO special."
3,Weak Sauce,"For Dane Cook being a superstar comedian I felt that many of his jokes were forced. However, it was a high-energy show and I would reccommend it for an audience that doesn't like alot of language but isn't too high-strung."
1,Like Poison,"This is what they probably play in the waiting lobby of hell. This is possibly the worst performance in all mankind. Comedic regression at its worst. I would rather shove nails in my eyes and have a monkey play with my ear than to have my senses suffer this misery again. I'd rather get 95 warts between my cheeks than sit through 95 minutes of this again. I burned my copy and went to Church to repent after seeing this. Dane Cook, may the good Lord have mercy on your soul."
2,Fairly boring,"Having been a huge fan since his Comedy Central debut, I really thought Dane would keep coming with the goodness. Instead, he's just ended up plain and long-winded. I thought for the biggest performance of his career, he maybe could have at least written all new jokes for it. As I was watching, I was finishing his jokes for him since I've heard most of them over the past 4 years. Save your money on this one. I REALLY wish I would've."
4,A pretty good game...,"This was the first game I got for my PS2. I loved it in the beginning. It had all the things I wanted in a PS2 game. It was easy to figure out and fallow along with. But it got a LOT harder in the end. It was like I couldn't do anything to beat it(the part I'm talking about is after you collect the somewad amount of power cells that you need in the beginning). I just gave up then. About 2 months later i started to play it again. Well, since I hadn't played it an a couple of months, I stunk big time. So it was even harder for me. Now I'll probably sell it at GameExchange. I suggest now you get the sequal ""Jack II."" Like I said in the begining, ""A pretty good game."" So I rated it 3 stars."
5,The Coolest Original Playstation Game,"Jak and daxter is basically a game were you must collect Powercells , Metal fly thingys and orbs . It is short but packed with action . The ending is confusing and there should be a sequel.Pros-Good graphics-Fun action-Good script-Plenty of bad guysCons-No repeatable Minigames-Diffucult Power cells followed by too easy onesAll in all ,If you Hadnet bought it already you sould."
4,Fun,I got this game for my husband because he remembered playing it as a kid.. and he loved playing it as an adult too! He would hardly share with our children!
4,My son and I love it!,"This has to be my favorite adventure game now. It took about a year and I almost beat it, then my son over wrote my file so I only play with him now. I got it when he was 4 and it was good because there isn't any reading and lives are unlimited. But he didn't understand the concept of the whole adventure and getting the orbs and what not to advance, but it kept him entertained. Definitely worth it. Now he is 7, he still plays it often."
2,Over-hyped.,"It has good graphics, controls, animations, and the gameplay is decent. It's too short (can beat it in 2 nights), has framerate issues, not to mention camera clipping problems. The humor isn't that funny. NOLF had better writing for example. All in all, I had a lot more funny playing Metal Gear Solid II than J&D."
3,OK,This game is kindof fun. I would rather have MGS than this.Pros- good gameplay- fun story- graphics are goodCons-repetitive- childish
2,"Ok, simple but ok","When I first got this game it was the first game I got on my playstation2 so I thought it ws just great because I had not yet experienced better games. To complete the game totaly, you must capture 100 power cells. After hard work and many long hours I succesfuly obtained these 100 power cells eager to find out why I needed them. For those of you who have not played this game stop reading now. I needed those 100 power cells to open a silow. So jak and daxter stanp in front of the slowly opening gateand all that is behind it is a white light. They stare at it dumbfoundeduntl final Kira exclaims its beautiful and in no time Im staring at the rolling credits, bad ending. Mega bad ending, Terible ending. Good graphics(kind of cartoonish), bad animation, jerkey characters and an entriging exploration. Ounce you really get down to it it is a very simple game that kids under 10 will really enjoyed."
4,J&D!!!!!!!!!!!,"This game is so cool! It's better than other RPA,s(Roleplaying Adventure.) The graphics are cool.And Eco is my Favorite. There are 6 of them.Red,Yellow,Blue,Green, and White.I like Defeatingthe Precursor Robot. this game is really fun.the storyline is pretty funny (sometimes.) From the makersof Crash 1,2, and 3 THIS GAME ROCKS!! When I thoughtI said I want that game.I got it for my birthday.I Luv this game so much that I start over on my other Memory Card. This is a MUST HAVE video game.if You like Action\Adventure games You'll Definitly like thiscuz it,s a role-playing-game & a Action\Adventure game!"
1,A tree can come up with a better game!,"First of all, if critical veiws offend you do NOT read this.Easily one of the worst games I've ever played. The battles are a big stupid joke, the plot is cheesey(too much like Spyro), it's too short and easy. A good game for two year-olds, not serious gamers."
2,"OK game, not great.",This is an adventure game where travel through worlds collecting things for an adventure. This game has pretty good game play and really good graphics. If you like crash then you will probably like this.Gameplay: 8Graphics: 10Story: 3Objects:4Overall:5
2,I thought it was some kind of sick joke...apparently not,"""Mommy! Mommy!"" cries a little sissy boy. ""Can we go to the store and buy Jak and Daxter because i am such a spoiled little brat?"" The mom should reply ""Well you are a little spoiled brat so you get to get beaten!!"" After hours of reckless beating the bruised boy asks again ""Now can we go get the game?"" the mom should say ""That game is to stupid for you. its to stupid for anyone. Ha Ha Ha!!! You dont get the game!!! Now you little brat go do the dishes before i conk your scrawny little butt!"""
2,Wow,"What kinda game is this? I thought this would be an awsome game! But no, its not that great. At first you see the amazing landscape, fun fights, and different contraptions. Then after a day.......... the game keeps repeating. There is almost no new enemies. COME ON LET ME FIGHT SOMETHING ELSE. There is practicaly one boss, and jak can't jump. He tries, but cant. Hes almost as bad as the dude in kingdom hearts. And what the heck is with this idiot Daxter? Whats his point in the story? The comic releif? NO WAY. He says idiotic things like LOOK OUT or AHHHHH or even dont die on me Jak, I need someone to feed me. JEEZ WHAT THE CRAP IS THE POINT OF HIM. He cant do anything, just flies around like a weirdo. If your looking at good adventure games, look at Rachet and Clank, Kingdom Hearts, and Harry Potter. Try to stay away from this game, or be prepared to throw it against the wall."
2,"Good, but not the best thing since swiss cheeze.","Great graphics, decent gameplay. It does have camera clipping problems, not to mention framerate problems and it's too short. You can beat it in 2 nights. It's also just too ""cutesy"" for my taistes. The humor wasn't all that funny either. NOLF had better writting for example. When it comes down to it, I had a lot more fun playing Metal Gear Solid II than J&D."
4,THE GREATEST GAME THAT EVER LIVED!,"This game's instruction manual is a map of the game's world. Naughty dog out did them selves with the details. The details are amazing because ther so yery detailed with all the colores and landscapes and with 17 areas and vehicles, characters and creatures and even a secrt movie. Yup from geyser rock to the dark eco silo jak and daxter is the greatest game everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!"
5,Jak and Daxrer The Best Games of The Years,"Remember Sly Cooper, and Ratchet and Clank? Well, It's me and t-he next best animated and safe from harm games, not like thoseillegal GTA games... that you kill innocent people and hurt cop-s, I don't like em! (though Jak II is like em but its not as bad as well you know what)Graphics, well made... Sandover Village, best... Lava Tube, dar-kest.Sound, well constructed, buy now, ask questions later!Levels1. Geyser Rock2. Sandover Village3. Sentinel Beach4. Forbidden Temple5. Misty Island6. Fire Canyon7. Rock Village8. Precursor Basin9. Boggy Swamp10. Lost Precursor City11. Mountain Pass12. Volcanic Crater13. Spider Cave14. Snowy Mountain15. Lava Tube16. Gol and Maia's Citadel17. Dark Eco SiloOverall, a hilarious and quick game, but a wee bit longer thanSly Cooper and The Thievous Racoonus and not as long as Ratchetand Clank 1 or the series, be sure to check out Ratchet and Cl-ank: Going Commando."
2,TOO EASY!!!,"Good graphics, but....THE BOSSES REALLY STINK! Too easy, too repetitive, too well, just BLAH! If you want the worlds are too short, too easy, and they give you the answer to the missions! No secrets, all you do is jump, roll, and stare. The regular monsters don't have health, they just die instantly. Plus, the whole game is a waste! The plot doesn't even go the way it should! I guess if you want an easy, stupid-plotted game, pick this one, but if youwant serious game play, look away!"
5,"Fun, beautiful game.","This was a most enjoyable game. The controls are simple to grasp so it's easy to jump right into the game. One of things I loved most about this game were the rich colors used. It makes the game very pleasing aesthetically all the way through and it has good replay value. Gameplay is fairly easy, but fun nonetheless. I highly recommend this to anyone."
4,An adventure worth playing...,"A good game with awesome graphics and intermediate game controls. However the game leaves you wanting more, a bit of a let down when it comes to overall game content and storyline. A good game though, worth playing at least once!!"
5,Jak and Daxter Rock!,"The graphics in this game are excellent. Jak and Daxter work together to reach their goal. Daxter, having been turned into a rat, is very funny as a break dancing sidekick. Jak has loads of obstacles and challenges to face. Watch out for the ""jaws"" shark.I've been gaming for years. This is lots of game play for your $$."
3,Crash Bandicoot All Over Again,"Jak and Daxter is pretty much like Crash Bandicoot over again but with diferent characters and story plot. Besides that it's a fun game to play. Jak is the hero and Daxter the little fuzzy dude is his smart mouthed friend...which does nothing but sit on your shoulder throught the whole game. The game starts to get really hard after playing it for awhile almost impossible. the graphics are pretty cool. there's even time periods in the game day, noon, night, sunrise and sundown. The controles are pretty easy too."
5,Ya know I actually give this game a 10. And I just bought it,"Daxter (the annoying but funny, and fun to listen to sidekick) and Jak (the adventurous, babe magnet, super stud hero) Make a great team. Daxter, with his smart-mouthed remarks, and funny dances and Jak with his smooth moves and...cool clothes!!WARNING: this game is highly addictive."
5,Very Excellent Game,"This is a great game. I played at my friends house and immeadiatly loved it. It's a great game. If you like Crash. Spyro, and Banjo Kazooie, then you will really love this game."
3,Power cells...,"This is a beautiful(forest,water,beaches) platform game. Very realistic and detailed. Daxter adds the cuteness factor while being the ""mascot"". Luckily, you have missions; go out and find power cells,etc. Unfortunately, that can get reeally boring after searching and searching. If you don't get everything you can't move to the next part. Probably best to have the strategy guide next to you. On my own I grew frusterated and wasn't close to finishing the game by the time it was due back. I do wonder that if I had bought it, I'd have gotten farther and feel differently. After this, there were two Jak minus Daxter games made which turned me off and reviews for those said that the games were in a new battle type direction, so I never tried any more."
2,all about jak an daxter,I praise the good lord that I only rented this game for 7 nights. To be honest it didn't 4 nights. The game is toooo easy and simple. On top of that it is tooooo short. However it was fun for the short 4 nights that I had it. Naughty dog used to the good games like Crash Team Racing and Crash 2 my favorite out of the first three. But this junk errr game or game wanabee is just the example of how good companies can screw up BIG time. The one time I about it is the hoverbike but that is about it. So go out and get a real game like Spyro the dragon:Year of the Dragon which should be cheaper and better than this junk.
4,very good game.,"Daughter (10) and husband greatly enjoyed this. Nicely animated, younger daughter (6) preferred monsters inc.. (Hi kids, go to dubaitourism.co.ae and find Mandy Z comments.)"
2,not very good,"The first time i popped this game into my ps2, i was so excited. But 12 hours later i was bored of it because i had rapped the game. Not that it's to short, like another reviewer said, it just leaves you wanting more, you don't feel very proud after savig the world in 12 hours. And because it lacks a multiplayer mode, the replayability is 0. I tried to beat it again, but after 30 power cells i gave up because it was very boring. This is an OKAY game the first time around, but after that its not that great. But it has stunning graphics, good controls, good sound, but not much depth or replayibility. Overall it's an ok game, but could have been MUCH better. Get a crash bandicoot game, 2 or 3, their much better than this game."
4,Sorry Story,"Jak & Daxter is good in everything, except the story. I think if you don't care about the story, then it could match the #1 game. Buy this for adventure, action, graphics, and fun. Its #1 without the story."
4,I have to drag my son away!!,I bought this for my son for his birthday and now I'm having a hard time getting him away from the Play Station to do his homework and even eat. He has at least 50 Playstation games but he hardly touches the other ones anymore. This is a real winner- if you're bigger than your kid!
5,Jack and Daxter,"I have never played a more adventurous game, Jak and Daxter is full of surprises, I recommend this game for everyone who likes adventures and is patient enough to keep trying."
5,DEMO IS HERE,"I have recieved a demo, that s right a playable demo, from Playstation Underground. This game is awesome. You can roam around the fully 3-d environment or zoom on the A-Grav uh... zoomer. You collect Blue and Red and Green eco, a kind of energy source for speed and attack power and health. Jak does the action, while Daxter gives tips and cracks jokes. You must complete certain tasks to gain power cells which allow you to beat the level.Think of a mix between Crash bandicoot, Spyro the Dragon, and voila!JAk and Daxter. You'll love it."
5,A Game Thats Better Than Ratchet & Clank G.C.!!,"It was my first time renting the game , it was ssssssssssooooooooo CRAZY!!!!! It was like Lord Of King The Two Towers mixed with Rachet & Clank! The Accories are:Controller &a 8MB memory card.In this game they have strong characters!! Ifthis was Nintendo it would be like Kirbey, Mario & Zelda all toghter in one whole game, anfortunally that would never be sucha game there for they have made this game instead.If you like Rachet & Clank Going Cammando or Jak 2 or trying to find better games/graphics than those 2 games, well you've come to the right place!! Amazon always have the best games at the best prices!!P.S. If your parent's ain't ganna let you buy beg for it if that doen't work tough luck!!"
5,One of the best out there no doubt!,I'm highly satisfied by this product. Jak and Daxter is nostalgic and not to mention a freaking awesome game. The product arrived on exact time that it was estimated and it was brand new. It really surprised me how new it was considering the game itself is more than 12 years old. I'm absolutely satisfied.
5,Great game for everyone,"Jak and daxter the precursor legacy is an amazing game. The story is jak and daxter went to an island that they were warned not to go to and there daxter gets transformed into a otter/weasel. Now Jak must find the sage Gol and turn daxter back. The story is simple but it is very lighthearted which is something in which platformer storys should be. Besides the game doesn't take itself to seriously. The controls were very simple and responsive and the graphics were great. While graphics do not matter in a game it still looks nice. The gameplay is fantastic. It is very similar to banjo kazooie, spyro the dragon, and crash bandicoot. The game is a nonlinear adventure and has tons of platforming and exploration. The game has a medium difficulty and anyone can just sit down and have a good time. This game is perfect and everyone should play it."
1,horrible game,jak and daxter is the most overated game of all time. yes the graphics are excellent. but you know as well as i that graphics dont make a game gameplay does. and that in fact is what jak and daxter completely lacks. they give you a huge amount of space and very little action. most of the time youre wanderingaround looking for something to do. you collect eggs and powercells thats pretty much it so the game is pointless. the boss fights are a joke the bad guys need one touch and the characthers look awful. the game is basically an easy kids game and i wouldnt recomend it to anybody more than 12 years of age. the camera angles are very bad the controllers ... and nothing is really intresting. and the little amount of game jak will provide you with is extremely childish. i urge you to rent this game its not worthy of purchasing. i would recomend to you rachet and clank or jak and daxters roughet tougher seqeul jak 2.
1,just plain awful,this game is so stupid. its easy has basically no gameplay and is childish all the way trough. the gameplay is horrible most of the time youre just looking for something to do because of the lack of action. the bad guys can be knocked down with one hit and the boss battles are a BIG joke. the game is easy childish has a stupid storyline. the controls are extremely difficult to understand. the graphics are excellent but who cares if theres nothing to do. i mean i reaally dont get the popularity of this. i think rachet and clank is way better. make sure you pass thisv one by just rent it if you must play it. i encouurage you to buy rachet and clank over jak and daxter.
3,Patheticly easy.,"First of I'm noy a kid I'm just don't have a reviewer name. This game was okay just it was way too easy.I defeated the boss of rock village in 1 try and beat the game in 2 days. The story lines a little dumb as well. Your friend(Daxeter) turns in to a ferret-thing and you risk your live to find Gol, the guy who can change Daxter back to his regular form, who's acctuly the bad guy. The scenenery's nice in this game i like to just run around looking at it sometimes and the graphics aren't to shabby either. I didn't want to give this game one or two stars because I don't hate the game I like it but it's not a favorite.Over all if your not good at video games buy this game but If you are good look for a different title instead."
5,"Fun, Fun, Fun","Let me start by saying I haven't exactly been a big fan of platform games since the 16-bit era. During the NES and Genesis years, I loved them, but once the 32-bit era hit, the 3D platform games seemed dull and uninspired to me. But, since it had been so long since I've played that type of game, and I'd heard so many good things about Jak & Daxter, I decided to buy it once it became a Greatest Hits title.I have to say that Jak & Daxter has surpassed my expectations. The huge, open, ""go anywhere"" world and levels, the beautiful, colorful graphics, and the type of gameplay that allows you to do what you want when you want is refreshing and very, very fun. The world of Jak & Daxter is beautiful to take in, and the gameplay is addictive. Great control, great gameplay, wonderful characters, astounding graphics, and great sound make this game a great experience."
4,A True Next Gen Game,"Get ready for a massive adventure with beautiful graphics and enjoyable gameplay, thats what you'll get if you give this game a chance, not to mention whacky characters, zany humor, and awesome voice acting.Sure, Jak and Daxter may not be the most challenging game you've ever played but it beats the heck out of the Crash Bandicoot series, but it also has has a small relation to it, such as riding vehicles and creatures, smashing boxes, and a tropicle setting. If you liked Crash you'll love Jak and Daxter. Go get it."
5,Just about flawless... perfect for kids,"In a world full of violent and sexual, mature PS2 games (and i dont mind those), it seems as if the PS2 was meant for teenagers on up. Well not now. Jak and Daxter is a flawless PS2 game, reminding me somewhat of Super Mario 64, Banjo Kazooie, or Crash Bandicoot. This is a nice breath of fresh air for PS2 owners... something your little brother can play, have a great time, laugh, without hesitating. and it is a good game, dont get me wrong. one of the best games ive ever played! its self explanitory, easy, and tons of fun. Once you get used to everything on the fist stages, it gets harder though, so it isnt a total walk in the park. there are great voice overs, and their worlds are very vibrant and have lots of color. Its the first good game for PS2 for all ages. While crash bandicoot on the PS2 really disappointed me, try this one instead."
1,naughty dog has dropped the ball,what is this junk..... forget this game and go out and buy R and C going commando .. or the prince pf persia !!
1,Jak and Daxter- Very Confusing!,I would just like to know right now if i am the ONLY person who has completed the first level and it wont let you go to the second. Becuase of this i took the game back and used the money to buy the best game in video game history- Grand Theft Auto III!Go buy GTA3!!
1,This game is crap!,"I can't belive that this is even out there! I am SO DISSAPOINTED! Daxter is nothing but a furry rodent that annoys you every 5 seconds. This game is not very good. Instead, get Jak II or Ratchet and Clank. You will not be dissapointed by those two games. Avoid this at all cost!"
3,Too simple,"This is a poor game. Its fun, but once u play other games like grand turismo 3, twisted metal black, kingdom hearts.... Its a tho its the worst game ever. Its still worth buying, only if u have nothing else better to buy."
4,"A Cool, Stylish, Over-Way-Too-Soon Platformer","This game is platforming done right. Huge sprawling levels filled with tons of intricate detail and no loading (almost). On top of that a blast to play with very little bad to say about it. Gameplay is well refined and a little borrowed from their past Crash games. Is the game too short? No. About 16-20 hours of solid gameplay. Why I said it was over way too soon is because once you get to the end of the game you are left really wanting more. The only teeny-tiny draw back are those ugly PS2 jaggies, they don't hinder your gaming experience but when you step back to take in the amazing detail you seem 'em crawling around everything. A great game no-the-less."
2,Play the full game in one day.,"Entertaining and enjoyable but too short. Beat it in one day.Worth a rent but not a buy.Note to naughty dog: What was there is nice but there was too little of it too justify $.... You needed at least 5 times the content to make it worth buying this is a rental game only guys. Oh and thanks for nothing concerning the door that requires 100 power cells to open.Note: After you defeat the game there is another door wich requiers you to collect 100 power cells to enter. Don't bother. When you collect the 100 power cells and go to the door it opens, a bright light comes out, the charactors say ""oh that is beautiful"" and that is all that happens. I guess they really wanted to get this game on the market before it was finished or it was a cruel joke to those who collected the 100 power cells for nothing."
2,Over Rated,"You remember how much fun it was to run around and jump and dive when you first got Mario 64? It was fast, it was easy, the transitions from running to jumping to landing and running again were seemless. Movement was fun, and there were lots of different places to try it, thats what made the game worth playing. Thats what makes a good 3D platform game, good control and good transitions between movements.And thats exactly what Jak and Daxter doesn't have. Running and jumping is such a jarring experience, you might as well come to a complete stop evey time. It's really just not fun. They may have well designed levels, but who cares if your controls suck."
2,hit it with a daxter,"you can totally throw the little dude!! he just hangs around and then you're like, ""WHAM!! EAT MY DAXTER!!"" when i first played this game i couldn't believe my eyes. don't get me wrong, i wouldn't play this game with my eyes closed or anything, but when they were open it was like, ""wow!"" trust me on this one!"
4,Old but it still knows how to kick ass!,"I completed this game in 2001 and I must admit this was the best platformer of it's time. But now, it still remains a top platformer for you travel a giant world through beaches, snowy mountains, jungles, islands and even volcanoes doing all sorts of things to help people or yourself.Even today I would recommend it if the price is under 25."
3,Entertaining,"The characters are funny and it's a great way to kill time. The graphics are awesome and the camera views are great. After a while, it gets boring cuz you have to go back and forth, and the camera angles get you dizzy after a while. If you happen to enjoy those ""super mario"" type of games, where you have to kill mini enemies that obstruct your path and collect ""stuff"" in order to complete missions, then this is a game for you."
5,this game has soooo many worlds!!!!!,"my sister and i loved this Game!!! it was a small bit sad when the only thing behind the door was just light. but the game was so fun!!! for my sister and i it took um, 2 or three monthes to finish it.....i think. i am looking for info about Treasure Planet now.. it sounds fun.."
4,One of the Best PS2 Games I've ever played!,"Jak and Daxter, two best friends looking to get in some trouble. Crystal clear graphics and perfect sound make this game a perfect choice for a beginner or and expert at games. This was actually my first game and it was the best game I ever played compared to Spyro, Year of the Dragon, not that I'm saying its a bad game. Jak and Daxter is the best adventure game around. Try it ASAP, you won't regret it."
4,My 3 year old loves this game,"My 3 year old got this game for Christmas and he loves it!! So far he has made it through most of the levels on his own and only needed help with a few of them. We are only about half way through the game now. I must say I love the game as well, from what I have played so far it's a great game. Definately worth the money."
4,"Great game, but short...","This game is fun for all ages and has excellent graphics! It has some funny characters (mainly Daxter) and is a ""Greatest Hits"" game. The game is about how Daxter transforms into a muskrat by falling into a pool filled with ""Dark Eco."" He decides to set off on a journey with Jak, in search of a cure for his transformation. The game is an action/adventure/platform type. You (Jak) must complete different tasks to receive Power Cells that help aid your quest. The moves that Jak can perform are pretty neat. There are the basic jumps, punches, kick spins...stuff like that, and then there are the uppercuts, rolling turbo jump, dive attack, and the aerial attack. I thought that the only bad thing about the game was that it was too short. I finished the game in about 1-2 weeks, couple hours a day. I just hope that the sequel will be much longer. Overall, I recommend this game to anyone that likes to play adventure/platform games. =)"
5,This game is as good as MGS2!,This game is one of the best games I've ever played ever since MGS2!This game easily deserves 5 Stars ever since you start playing it!Ya know what's the funny thing about Jak is?He looks like a Super Saiyan from DragonBall!I think Jak And Daxter and Metal Gear Solid 2 both are equal.
5,GREAT!!! but not as good as crash,these are the creators of crash bandicoot and crash bash.what happens in this new game is jak and daxter go to beast island when they are not suppose to go there.daxter gets turned into the little creature on the front of the game.now the new legacy begins!
3,"Just want to help other mom's, like reviews helped me!","This chair is beautiful and the most sturdy, but the back is to straight. Even at 6 months my son was hanging over the side, he looked so unconfortable that I had to return it. It looks great for older babies."
1,You Need More Out of a Highchair,"This highchair is atractive yes, however, realistically if you purchase only one chair, this shouldn't be the one. With dr's recommending babies start solids at around 4 months it is a hindrance that this chair doesn't recline. Neither is it as comfortable as many of the other seats on the market. We ended up with an Evenflo model with a toy tray, and are very happy. If you are replacing your highchair, or are buying for an older child this might be a good choice....."
4,Beautiful but use it later,"I fell victim to the ignorance of many 1st time moms. I bought this high chair for looks & because I had a wooden high chair when I was little. There's not many wooden ones out there. However, it's good that it has the plastic tray to protect from germs that would hide in a wooden tray. My goodness, sometimes I wonder how my generation survived! ha ha.All in all, it will be a great high chair & it looks great in the corner of our dining room. We have hardwood floors. However, my 5 month old is not quite got the hang of sitting up & it's a pain to feed him in right now. I wish I'd gotten one that had a reclining position."
4,Great chair! :),"I have triplets and purchased three of these. Overall they are great, the pad is terrrible, but I took it off and left it off after the thrid washing. Either my babies are especially talented escape artist, or they need to improve the safety straps. Those are my only complaints, overall, this is a solid built wooden chair. I do not want a chair with toys, bells and whistles attached since I do not want my babies to learn that dinner time is ""play time."" I also did not want a plastic chair that took up a lot of space. I like that the tray removes to reveal a smaller eating area that is great for my young babies. Worth your money."
4,"I loved the chair, but not the seat cover","I bought this chair after having one of those ugly bulky gargantuan high chairs. I put felt pads on the bottom that made it easy to slide on the floor. I wiped it down after every feeding and once a month used a toothbrush with bleach water to clean in small places. The pad WAS easy to clean and wash when needed, but the vinyl coating has started to come up and now its pretty shabby looking. I am currently looking for a Eddie Baur pad, or one that would just comparably fit it to replace it. My daughter is still using this chair at age 3...I use it without the little table and it fits perfectly up under my counter bar in the kitchen, where we sit and eat breakfast and snacks together. I have a booster chair for my table set. When she finally outgrows this, provided I can find a pad replacement, I will be able to use this for my grandkids. It will never fall apart, its solid. If anyone has a tip about the high chair pad, please share!"
1,Disapointed,"I was really excited to have the matching high chair and swing, and we tried twice to have the high chair sent to us undamaged. The first chair had a peice of the wood broken off. The second had two big cracks in the wood. I really wanted the chair, but I started to question the durability, and decided to get a refund."
1,Please Use Caution,"This chair is the newer version of a gift that we had registered for (same basic design), in part because of the ""traditional"" and attractive design. The problem is the spacing of the wooden slats. Our daughter, who is 9mo. old and of normal size, got her leg through the slats and got it stuck. Thankfully, my husband is a contractor and was home. We had to SAW THE CHAIR APART to get her out. Needless to say, this was pretty traumatic and we would hope that this doesn't happen to anyone else."
5,nice,got this item free after purchasing the other items. 2 gb is small but it help to keep small files
4,Little Boys,"Gave a blue and red one to my 3 and 4 year olds. They loved them! They were fairly sturdy and easy to put together. After puting together the 1st one I decided to use Elmers Wood Glue on the 2nd one and it stayed together much better. I ended up taking the 1st one apart and doing the same to it. All in all, great product for the price!"
1,Controller in bad shape,"I thought I was ordering a controller that had hardly been touched, but this one was disgusting. It had grease and grime all over the left joy-stick, and the buttons were sticking. I paid $20 for a $5 USED controller."
5,This controller rocks so hard!,"I had one of these when we used to play the Nintendo 64 back in the day. Mario Party and Perfect Dark were our main guilty pleasures. You all know what they look like but for some reason, the green one really stuck out to me so I had to have it. It never, not once let me down.I can't vouch for what you get when you order this, but if the order is what I think it is, then you're in for a treat! A nice, green one. ^_^"
2,N64 Control,"Everything about the control worked fine, except for the most important part, the joystick. It moves but doesn't completely work, for exapmple; a character that is supposed to run (Link in Ocarina of Time) only walks in the direction you move the joystick. Makes games hard to play for sure."
5,A Medic's War,"In this day of wasteful fiction it is exciting to read a book based upon real life occurances.A.NettlesMarietta, GA."
3,An enjoyable bit of fluff.,"But be assured it's no more than that. Jackie is an engineer that is working on a project to dispose of nuclear waste. When she moves to San Francisco she joins a dating service, appropriately named Mates and Dates, in search of Mr. Right. I didn't think a person could find so many Mr. Wrongs. Why she put up with some of them was beyond me.I found the writing flat and lacking in wit. The characters spend a lot of time going out to dinner and sampling wine or coffee. The conversations are simple and straightforward with no banter or clever repartee. I would give this one a 3.5 if that option were available. It's amusing enough if you are in the mood for a light read. Kelsana 5/17/01"
2,very disappointed,"I purchased this book after reading the description, which made it seem good. I was very disappointed. This book was just plain stupid and unrealistic. Very bad, buyers beware!"
4,"good for the value, needs wheels and a bit more power","The first time I tried this I rated it a four. Now after using it for awhile (or trying) I realize it doesn't get much up. It is great when you are tired because it is light. Good for hard floors. But not much good on carpet. Doesn't have the power of a big shop vac and it doesn't come with a real vacuum cleaner attachment. Not much good at sucking up pet hair off the carpets which I hoped for. Very light though for those days when I don't want to drag around my weighty cumbersome upright Kenmore Progressive. I originally rated this four stars, but after using realized that although its lightness is wonderful, the fact that it doesn't have enough power to do much is a problem. Good for quick jobs though but only on hard surfaces. I tried to change my star rating by editing but I guess Amazon does not permit me to edit that. Sorry folks."
1,Junk!!!,"I purchased this item from Lowes in gray/blue. I used it about 12 times, once per month for a year, when it suddenly stopped working. I attempted to repair it by dismantling the entire unit, and inspecting the switch, thinking that the switch had failed. I couldn't find anything faulty with the internal wiring, and the motor spins normally, so I've concluded that this product is not properly engineered for long term use. In other words, it's designed to fail (functional obsolescence) in a short period of time. Buyers beware!!!"
4,Accurate picture of Guatemala's false democracy,"Interesting narrative of a political crime organized within Guatemala's army and its difficult resolution, indeed it is a good insight of that country's long suffering and repulsive political system."
4,A Murder Mystery,"A well written book that reads like a murder mystery, but is loaded with painfully-researched facts. This was recommended to me by my Latin American History teacher, and I enjoyed it. I think that Amazon's rating system is silly - why would I give 1 star to something I hate? I give this book 3 stars with my rating system. Here is my rating system:rating system:0 stars - I regret reading this1 star - not worth reading, but I don't regret it2 stars - worth reading, but would not recommend3 stars - (average) good book that I would recommend (I have high standards)4 stars - This book stood out5 stars - Excellent book. Will definately re-read this book several times."
1,Limited Appeal,"This book is not badly written for what it is. But the review excerpts on the front and back cover are extremely misleading. This is not a riveting page-turner. It is generally a broad examination of political corruption in Guatemala and specifically an examination of the murder of a priest. In my opinion it has a very limited appeal. You would have to have lived in Guatemala to have much of an interest in the book. As they say with a good book ""you can't put it down"". This book you can't wait to put it down and don't want to pick it up. It is boring to say the least. If you have insomnia maybe it will help you get to sleep."
3,Sampler,"This CD will give you an idea of the diverse selections of nature recordings available from ""Sounds of Nature"".I was disappointed that the first three, ""Morning Birds"", ""The Garden"" and ""Paradise Island"" all sounded the same - just birds, birds, birds....at least on the small clips I heard of each. Why don't we hear more variety of insects, or the wind rustling the leaves, for example?I did especially enjoy ""Deep Into the Earth"" because it was something unusual - intermittent drops of water falling in a ? cave creating a fascinating and haunting echo which reminded me of my experiences spelunking.""Wind Chimes"" also sounded promising. I wish there were a track of Loons.""Mountain Stream"" also was pleasing.Several tracks sounded much like one another, creating repetition.So, I won't listen to this all the way through as I had hoped to do, but will only use it as a guide for possibly buying more individual CDs.Cheers."
5,great book!,"This is a wonderful book but is the exact same book, word for word as Building your SElf-image. It was just re-published with a different title."
1,Allergens Must be listed about each food item,"I was extremely dismayed when I received the product only to read on the label that it contains WHEAT starch as well as honey. I was looking forward to using the powered form for baking and being allergic to wheat and other gluten products I can't use this. Also it cannot be returned due to some kind of laws about food products. PLEASE, Amazon and all sellers LIST allergens on the description of your product for the thousands of us who have food allergies."
1,THIS PRODUCT IS A FRAUD!!!,"I ordered this SO CALLED Honey Powder from BARRY FARMS ~ it is a FRAUD !! It is not HONEY POWDER. It isWHEAT with something else mixed with it. It does not dissolve, it DOES NOT have HONEY in the mix. On topof their frauding the public, they make sure you cannot return it and get a refund. They should bereported for the fraudelent manner they are operating.I THREW both bags in the trash."
4,Margaret,"This was probably one of the best Sunfire books that i have read. (I really dont know how I found out about them, but they are actually okay as far as cheap romance novels go.) Anyways this book is good if you're looking for a quick read. I LOVED the ending. It was a ton better than Jennie ( if you're gonna read a Sunfire book stay away from Jennie, ...!) Anyway, Margaret is a prettty good book, I think you'll love it."
4,CHEAP FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS!,"My school bookstore was selling this book for 27 dollars, I paid about 9 dollars for it, which was wonderful because I only needed it for one semester! And I was able to sell it back for about the same! There is a good bit of information in this book and is a good read! I loved it!! :-)"
1,"Review of the Free Press ""hardback"" edition","This book is a paperback masquerading as a hardback. It is a paperback in every way except that it does have a rigid cover.I generally get a hardback edition of a book where available, so I ordered the Free Press Paperbacks ""hardback"" edition. If I'd looked at the name of the publisher that might have given me a clue that I should be wary, but unfortunately I did not.The book does not come with a dust jacket. The cover is printed like a paperback. The pages appear to be something close to newsprint, very flimsy and cheap. The book is physically smaller in dimension than I would expect a hardback to be. It is in every way what I would expect from a cheap paperback, except that it does indeed have a hard cover. There is nothing about the book to justify the outrageous price being asked for it. When I pay the higher price to get a hardback I expect to get a higher quality book. In no way does this edition deliver."
2,Started me REALLY thinking...,the petty gods that we projectare better stripped awaybut still the good and gracious Onecalls quietly each dayI found Blaise Pascal more persuasive...
3,"Some great insights, but...","A thoughtful and very important book. Many of the insights are compatible with a Christian worldview. The stories of sexual perversion are gratuitous and the author is too favorable with Freudian thought. If read with discernment, there is much to learn."
5,Great book ... Good Stuff,I got it in a timely fashion and no problems. Great condition!!!Great great great!!!!
2,For Insiders Only,"A well-meaning friend lent me his treasured copy of this book, telling me it is one of the most important he had ever read. I struggled with it for over an hour, but concluded that the reader must have a strong background in psychology, Freud, and cultural anthropology to make any sense of it. For example, he has a chapter and extensive commentary on Otto Frank. He doesn't explain who Mr. Frank is, so if you don't have a firsthand acquaintance with Freud, Maslow, Rank, and others in the field, the book has little value. I have no trouble with the issues of death that he wrestles with--maybe that's the problem."
3,The Denial of Death,Good book! Not a page turner. It takes some deep thinking and understanding. Well worthwhile!
3,denial,great addition to my library. glad i purchased it. worth the read. looking forward to other additions. love to collect.
5,Really interesting read,I found this book fascinating. Answers alot of questions about why humans act the way they do. Also makes you evaluate your life and why you do some of the things you do. Would recommend this to anyone with an interest in human behavior or life and death.
3,Schorlarly but badly titled,"This is a highly scholarly and philosophical book but I just find the title a bit wanting and inaccurate. The author discussed many philosophers and their concepts but not too many of them are directly related to death or the denial thereof as the title suggests. I expected a book very different from what I actually received as far as the content was concerned. I cannot say it's a bad book because it is not but the title does become a blot on the landscape. As far as the subject of death is concerned, there are definitely some which are far superior to this one."
3,Depends what you're looking for,"This book explains much of human behaviour and thought by the interesting theory that we try and deny our mortality by making ourselves heroes in some way.My problem is just that Becker also thought he had solutions to this behaviour, in the form of some sort of surrender to God, which he seems to admit is a pragmatic solution, not neccesarily based on truth. I think it is unfair to mix up scientific research with moralising, and the two should be divided more clearly.There are many interesting parts though. I especially enjoyed his interpretation of Freud's feinting episodes. As other reviewers mentioned, he has a great ability to write and it is difficult to put down.Overall, this is the usual not entirely factual self-help book, and for this it would get at least 4 stars. But if advertised as an objective, researched insight into the psyche, it doesn't live up."
5,A magnificant piece of workmanship,"I've been shopping for a heavy duty ball head that won't slip when I tighten down the knobs, and will hold my Canon 5D with telephoto lenses and extenders. I already have aBogen - Manfrotto Long Lens Monopod Bracketand wanted the ball head to accommodate the same mount plate on the camera. The product is expensive, but it is so impressively engineered I know it will be passed down to my children. Though hefty in size, it is surprisingly light in weight. Because the mount plate can slide on the head, I can carefully balance the weight of the camera and lens over the head for the best stability. This product is truly a work of art that's engineered for the professional high-end user. The specifications in the product description are 100% correct, and if anything they understate the beauty and sheer elegance of this product."
3,Good for action tracking photography,I bought this head to use initially for fashion photography and landscape in low light condition but it doesn't work for me. It's hard to maintain a straight frame so if I need to use a tripod at all I use a 3 axis head. On the other side this is a good head for tracking action as sports or wildlife. Anyway this head is not designed for lenses over 200mm in my opinion
5,The must have tool for every car!,"The Zen Buddist philosopher and motorcyclist Robert M. Persig once said ""The place to improve the world is first in one's own heart and head and hands."" This is the tool that places it all in your hands!The leverage afforded by this device is unbelievable. With this tool, you can remove any wheel at any time. It also gives you the torque to reinstall the wheel as well as if you had a impact driver. The sockets included with the wrench cover just about any lug nut out there. The handy bag keeps the kit all together in your trunk. It is well made and it is all good.We all know that automobile tires go flat at midnight in the rain. With this item, we still will not be happy about it, but this tool makes an unpleasant job a lot nicer!Get one and be prepared to change the world, one tire at a time!"
5,Exactly what I needed,"After I bought my custom wheels, I needed a thin walled socket. I keep the wrench and the socket that I use in the trunk and keep the other socket in my tool kit. Maybe I will need the other socket someday. Telescope works well, sticks a little bit sometimes, but if you man up a little bit it is no problem."
4,Good product for the price,"Package came as expected. I bought it for my Jeep since the tire iron that came with the Jeep has long since been lost. I have oversize tires and rims so it is just not quite long enough to reach the lug nuts. It uses a standard 1/2"" drive though, so with an extender it works great.My only complaint is that when the handle is telescoped out, the locking mechanism doesn't really work. Only knocking off one star because its still ridiculously cheap and easy to store in the Jeep."
5,Just what I needed,"Here;s the shot:Aftermarket rims - stock lug wrench - tire blows - lug wrench doesn't fit. Yep - it happened. I needed a thin wall socket and didn't know it until it was too late (car guys don't call tow trucks to change a tire!) This unit was priced right, good quality and I didn't have to raid my garage sockets for my trunk! Very happy now!"
5,Best lug wrench I've ever used,"This lug wrench from Gorilla does exactly what it says. It delivers a large amount of torque with less effort. Whether removing or installing wheels, you never want to worry about whether or not your wheels are torqued down enough, I've had the bad exeperience of a tire coming off after a shop failed to tighten it down all the way. With this wrench a 90lb weakling can apply sufficient torque to be safe. Also the thin wall sockets in this set are great and keep your wheels from getting scratched up around the lugs. Highly recommend. Not sure why someone reviewed the sockets as fitting too tight, as if that were a bad thing? Too loose of a socket will round of a lug nut for sure, and keep you from removing or installing a tire properly."
1,Don't waste your money on this book,I didn't like this book. Definetely not what I expected. Too many random ideas thrown together and not enough information to follow up on any of them. It was basically a paragraph or 2 on each idea.
5,"Lot of good info, short form","I couldn't figure out how to clean the miniblinds effectively. Now I do. While apartment dweller won't need all the info, there is something for just about everyone who needs it. Their company sells the best and most interesting cleaning tools you've ever seen. Customer service is also five stars. They know their stuff, and this book is a good example of it. Also: Talking Dirt, the newest book."
3,Good book,"Good book, thought it would be more specific to Spring Cleaning, but it was mostly a rehash of Speed Cleaning, which is excellent btw...the last chapters were more about what to clean once a year...which is what I wanted."
3,good product bad delivery comunication,The arista adapter arrived on time abd the product works great. The inly complaint I had was that there was no estimated time of arrival and I couldn't track my package with this seller. But the item did arive about 6 days later and was in good working order.
1,fits very loose...doesn't work for me...,"of the 3 I ordered 2 didn't work at all, 3rd one makes a loud hum if moved slightly. All three went into trash. Don't let my mistake become your mistake. Pass on this product."
4,Snug fit on both ends,"Snug fit on both ends, decent to good build quality, sound quality is good but I am no special ear to judge by. I hooked it up and it works for my situation. Audio device to Mini-mixer to speakers/amp."
2,The 3.5 socket has problem,the 3.5 socket feels very odd. it's possible but extremely hard to plug in and out...actually broke one of my headphones when I was trying to unplug
1,Hit and miss,"You get what you pay for. Buying this item is a gamble. I bought several, for use with a music keyboard lab I operate in my music classroom. Some (about half) are so loose fitting that they are worthless. Others fit the 1/8"" jack fine for awhile, then the silver ring comes off, and then they are useless, unless I snap the ring back on. I would not buy these again."
1,3.5 mm jack does not fit in it,though 3.5 mm to 1/4 inch adapter... for some reason my 3.5 mm jack does not fit it the female adapter. i have to buy another one to serve my purpose.
4,Good adapter!,"This adapter came 5 days after I ordered it. I have an amp, but I don't want to disturb the neighbors so I got this. When I got it, it was in pristine condition. After I plugged it in to my amp, I got my headphones out, this is why I gave it 4 stars. When I tried to plug the headphones in, I had to force the headphone jack about 5 times. Overall great product though, excellent quality, and sounds great."
4,Get the right book!,"The book is written well, BUT be careful when you purchase this book that you are getting the full-length updated version of the book with the BLUE cover, as pictured in the Amazon offering page. There is a very small old pamphlet edition with a red and black cover that has exactly the same title floating around out there. Be sure that you are getting the FULL-length version with the blue cover!"
3,Bozzio; Better Practicianer Than Teacher,"If, like me you're a large FZ fan, then you will more than likely enjoy this video. However if you're buying this with hopes of gaining some intuitive insights from Mr. ""Hands With A Hammer"" himself, good luck. Don't misunderstand, there are some true nuggets in here, you're going to need to bring a bucket and an axe though in order to mine them out. Terry does a much better job showing you how he does what he does than articulating how he does it. He especially struggles through several attempts to explain complicated meters and time signatures but proceeds to just beat the ... out of an awesome drum kit. There is however one previously unsung virtue of this romp through Mr. B's theories on percussion technique and that is Terry's hair. It very much dates this work as a symbolic testament to the outrageous hair of the 80's, and for that reason alone make this an enjoyable excursion. Enjoy!"
1,Melodrama,"Another reviewer wrote exactly what I was thinking after reading this novel: ""Jerry Springer-meet-E Lynn Harris soap opera"". Of course, since the theme of the book -- domestic violence -- is rather serious, you try to give it a chance. But this novel has no redemptive value. Luckily, it is a fast read, especially since you could easily skip every other page without missing much.Just a small example of the sentimental and unbelievable writing:<QUOTE> ""If you let me love you, I promise it will be an experience of a lifetime. Books will be written about it. Our love will be legendary, even in faily tales."" He knew exactly how to weave a spell strong enough to break the hardest of hearts. <UNQUOTE>Pleeeeese! This is completely stuff of afternoon soap-opera. And the author is not being sarcastic, there is no punch line."
2,disappointing,"though the book started out with my attention, as the pages drew on, it became dull and boring. I had to force myself to finish reading it. It was a good story, just not enough basis to keep me entertained. I don't recommend this book."
4,Scary,If you like tragedies you'll love this. It doesn't end as you'd expect. If you buy it get ready for a shocking ride.
2,Not worth buying,"Not really impressed with book. Thought it would be good, book cover looks inviting. But it's a book about a gay man who's abused by his lover. Not worth buying, or checking out from the library."
3,Not Happy,"The films are fine. Good quality tranfers. Pleased with that part. What do I HATE? They are double sided disks with films on both sides. This type of disk is difficult, if not impossible to handle without getting prints and dirt all over. I would be glad to pay a bit expra for 4 disks but doubie sided is a pain to deal with and usually results to damage on one side or another. BAD IDEA IN AN AGE OF CHEAP MEDIUM. Be Warned before you buy."
5,ProStretch Rocks!,"Soon after completing a race, I tried the ProStretch in a retail store. It allowed a great stretch, but because I had just finished the race I wasn't completely sold. A few days later, the old plantar fasciitis decided not to cooperate so I ordered the ProStretch from Amazon. It enables a great stretch from the knee down. I'm planning to order the bi-lateral stretching system."
5,A Multi-Level Success,"In Purple Sun, Lawrence McAuliffe tells a story of the loss of innocence, both individual and collective, and the lengths to which men will go to recapture innocence and find the truth and meaning of its loss. This is set against the backdrop of the Viet Nam War and its aftermath, a time when many of us underwent that same struggle. Aside from its deeper symbolic meaning, this book also succeeds on a sheer entertainment level. The author has accomplished the often difficult task of creating characters that are real, none are all good and none are all bad. Although you may not like all the characters, you do care about and want to know what happens to them. Like most pleasures, I found this book difficult to stop once I got started."
5,A story of compassion triumphing over the inhumanity of war.,"Lawrence McAuliffe takes us back to where many Americans wish never to go, to the Vietnam war. Again, we face its deadly contradictions. Again, we wonder at our own inability to comprehend what really happened in that place at that time. But this is no preachy sermon. This is a story of strong and complicated characaters who quickly suck up our empathy as they seek to solve a mystery by returning to that place and, in so doing, find some measure of peace in themselves. McAuliffe has penned a touching book and has done so with a magnificent sense of description, be it in 'Nam or in the remote ranges of the U.S."
5,Compelling,"I read Purple Sun in two sittings and was totally immersed and impressed with the story. It is very good and well written and because the events occured within my memory span, had a great deal of meaning to me. The role that Buddhism played in the story was compelling and made it even more fascinating to me. Overall, I really enjoyed the read and extend my compliments to the author."
5,Purple Sun by Lawrence McAuliffe is a gem of a book,"The lead characters, Isaiah and Patric, are interesting opposites. They are brought together by the disappearance of a young Marine in Vietnam. They worry about him and eventually go on a journey to find him.I was impressed by the spiritual thread woven through this book - it's a ""must read""."
2,Where's my cuddly toy?,"If nothing else he's a trooper, Old Andy. If stickability won grammies, he'd have a cabinet full. But, what really is the point of mid table respectability? Fifteen years ago the man was a contender, churning out pleasant, inoffensive rock lite such as `Cuddly Toy' and sporting a slightly unsettling stonewashed denim shirt/trouser ensemble. And now? Well, he's more `sophisticated' I suppose- gone are the axes and big choruses to be replaced by beats and bleeps of a more Timbaland persuasion. His voice is pleasant, sometimes evoking memories of Curtis Mayfield, but it's all a bit bland for its own good."
5,"It's very good, and it's very funny.","I am five years old, and my name is Elly. My kindergarden teacher read this book to us at school. I love it. I wanted to bring it home. It's very good, and it's very funny. There is a funny picture with all the cows dancing on the moon. They're wearing people clothes."
4,No Beefs From This Reader,"Author Toby Speed and Artist Barry Root are a great tandem; their masterpiece ""Brave Potatoes"" remains one of my favorite books of all time. This earlier book doesn't match that greatness, but it's pretty good in its own right.Kids (and adults) enjoy the ridiculous, be it illustrations or story circumstance. Silliness abounds in this story of cows in boots traveling to the moon to feast on moon grass and play sports while four children wait longingly for them back on Earth.With words like pickety,buggity, wickedy, thickety, Huckabuck, and Hillimadoon, Two Cool Cows makes for a great oral reading event. Its large, grand pages splashed with dancing and bongo playing cows add to the fun.Want a can't miss bovine sensation for the beginning reader set? Get a copy of Two Cool Cows."
5,My Favorite,"Of all the books I read to my daughter as a young child, Two Cool Cows is my favorite and a good thing too because I bet I read it 500 times. It has a good rythym and cadence and is fun to read. The pictures are whimsical and well done. Check out the sequel Brave Potatos. It is not as good but still better than Dr Seuss."
2,Looks too Fake.,"This pendant looks much better in the pic than in person. It's not shiny or special looking, just dull. And, the necklace fell apart after one wearing. I don't recommend it."
3,If it contained info on YEAR and PRICE..,"it would be perfect. As it is now, its just a (huge) coffee table book of very nice closeup pics of watches."
3,Not helpful but...,"...if you email the pubisher, you can get it for free. It's really only the monologues (off the cd's) and doesn't give 99% of the answers to the exercises in the book. Even with the lowest of expectations, you'll be disapointed. If you actually pay for it, you'll be angry too."
4,holds two adult-size bikes and one child bike,Box arrived wrapped in brown paper. Nothing was missing inside and all pieces were wrapped in plastic sleeves. Easy to assemble. One of the brackets could not fit into the holes in the frame. I was able to find a pair of holes that was a tad wider then the rest to fit this bracket. When the stand is placed near a wall it can hold two adult-size bikes in the left and right positions and a child bike in the center position. It cannot hold three adult-size bikes because the handlebars overlap. I did not place the rear wheel in the stand to avoid damage to the gears.The stand can hold a mountain bike with disc brakes with a tiny clearance around the brake disc.
1,Only for bikes with no disks or rear derailleur,"The uprights are far too tall, so they hit the expensive bits of any modern mountain bike - disc brakes and rear mechanisms are all at risk. I like the modular nature of the design, but it's just not safe for garage use, let alone in a truck bed.The uprights are also far too far apart to hold road bikes well, but that's apparent from the product description, so that's just a warning."
5,it's great,Product arrived in great packaging with all parts. Took 10 minutes to put together. I put two adult road bikes and one adult mountain bike in it and it accomodiated all three very well. I would highly recommend this product.
5,Just what I was looking for,I ordered this to keep our boys' bikes from falling over in the garage and hitting my car! It was very easy to put together and took me less than 10 minutes. It seems sturdy although it's lightweight. This was the only product I could find to accommodate three bikes and would be easy for kids to take their bikes in & out.
4,Solid portable bike stand,"I was looking at the larger outdoor style racks for a while. They are usually over $200 and hefty. The weight is great for larger bikes (we have 4 large bikes to store) but they seem pricey and impractical for moving. We order this model for an 1/8 of that price and it certainly does the trick. If you want something stronger, strap it to a piece of plywood. Good buy."
3,Too light...,"It seems well made, and serves the purpose, but even a slight tilting of a bike seems to torque the whole stand and actually move it around the garage. I guess I shouldn't be surprised. It's a moderately good rack."
3,A little disappointed,"I was a little disappointed with the sturdiness and weight of this product. It is incredibly light and kind of shaky. We are using it for smaller bikes, so it works OK. You get what you pay for, it was a great price and is serving our need, I just doubt it will make it through the year."
1,a phenomenal piece of garbage-totally incompatible with rear wheels and discs of any kind,"a phenomenal piece of garbage-totally incompatible with rear wheels and discs of any kindif you have disc brakes, or plan on storing even one of the three bikes with the rear wheel in the slot, go with another stand. even on a 29'er with 2.4"" tires, I needed to prop up the front wheel so it wouldn't bend the disc. This didn't give enough wheel engagement to hold the bike up. with the rear wheel in, it rested on the cassette and derailleur and not the tire. Propping it gave almost the same problem."
4,Easy and convenient,"Very easy to assemble, disassemble, transport and store. However, handlebars can get banged together and jammed together if the bikes are similar sizes. Need to alternate directions of bikes, but that is not always possible depending on available space. Need to watch that spokes aren't getting bent. Overall, it serves its purpose and is very lightweight and easy to use."
3,Works for me...but,"This bike stand was easy to install and seems sturdy enough to hold three bikes, which is just what I needed. The only drawback is I can only slide the front wheel into the holders. The back wheels don't slide in because the back derailleurs were in the way. Luckily my daughters bikes have kickstands so using the front wheel wasn't an issue, but if you don't have kickstands I'm not sure three bikes would stand up using the front wheel."
2,swagman 3 bike stand,When i opened the box all screws were missing. I have to go Home Depot to buy screws in order to assemble the rack.
3,Could be better for the college students,"Some words I wanted to look up, the dictionary did not have it. It needs to expand their vocabulary for the cost."
1,Expect to be frustrated,"I thought an electronic dictionary would be a convenient way to quickly find the meanings of unfamiliar words I encountered while reading (especially Wilber Smith novels). I purchased this device and have been cursing it to the point of flinging it in the trash. Lid hard to open. Buttons difficult to operate. Function logic cumbersome. But, that's just the beginning. The very first word I looked up wasn't in the dictionary, so the device displays ""corrections"" and then offers several unrelated words that are contained in its feeble memory. At least half of words I've looked up are not contained it this little piece of crap. I pulled it back out of the trash a will give it to my 7 year old grand daughter, maybe she'll find some use for it."
1,This stopped working,"It woked for 10 days and it stopped after that, I am in the process of contacting the seller."
5,Franklin Merriam-Webster's Dictioary & Thesaurus,This item proved to be more than I expected. I am enjoying using it and would highly recommend it to anyone.
3,Button Problem,I continually find that a letter that I had typed was omitted because I did not press it hard enough.
1,Not a good produce,"The dictionary and thesaurus is too limited to be of much use. Any odd word gets a ""correcting"" process and gives you other words . I would not recommend this unit above a fifth grader."
1,Not for big kids....,"I'm a college grad and I bought this dictionary thinking it would be convenient to look up words I didn't know in novels and the like. So far it seems to only have about 50% of the words I've looked up in the memory. Not too helpful, now if you are looking for word definitions like ""hedge"" - this is for you :)"
2,Dictionary for toddlers,the first three words I typed in to find definitions for it didn't have. Need I say more?
3,Disappointing,"I bought this dictionary as an aide to studying on the train. Unfortunately, it doesn't have all of the words that a standard dictionary or the online dictionaries have."
2,need a dime to open it,"The construction of this unit is really bad. It is so hard to open the cover. So if you have open it, don't close it untill you are sure that you won't use it for a while."
1,Not a good spelling corrector,"I bought this unit to replace an older Franklin Wordmaster that does a very goodjob of correcting my misspelled words and gives definitions.THE MWD460 DOES NOT!If you are looking for something to correct your bad spelling, then STAY AWAY FROMTHE MWD-460.Go with the Franklin Spelling corrector at $16.00"
2,More incomplete than what it claims,"The package says it has 274,000 words in its dictionary. I checked it against a very large dictionary I have at home that has 180,000 words. I pulled 10 uncommon words out of my dictionary, and none of them were in this one. Beware! This product is a basic dictionary at best."
1,"I can't believe, it worked just for one month!","The product I bought is new, however it did not even work for one month! I did not take the service plan. Not sure what to do! This is really disappointing!"
4,Picked this up for my uncle,My uncle is an avid reader and he's not the most tech-savvy person around. He had another Franklin dictionary product for years and literally wore it out and this is the replacement. He has been quite happy with it.
4,It's a great product!,"This is a great product, especially at such a low price.The best feature for me was the list of SAT words and flashcards. It was more efficient than making index cards or studying definitions from a regualar dictionary.The time it takes to define a word is fairly quick as well.Some definitions include funny etymologies toward the end that really help the word stick.There are a few drawbacks to the product. For instance, the screen doesn't light up, the word list can't hold more than 40 words, and the buttons sometimes tend to be unresponsive.Still, for about $30, you get more than you'd expect. At least if you're in high school. If you're an adult, then a dictionary with a larger word capacity would be a better buy.I definitely recommend it! :)"
4,Save 10 lbs of books in a 2oz item,Great space saving desk top reference. Don't know why I waited so long to buy one. Sometimes the cover is hard to pop open. Overall it is a snap to use.Darrell Byrd
4,nice and easy,"it is a nice, handy and easy tool to find words. The price is reasonable with its ability."
4,It's a headlight,"I was well satisfy with my purchase of ultimate white bulbs, for my car. My only dissapointment was that the lights are not as bright as I imagine, but they look so much better than the original ones, you see more of the road."
2,Redheads,"The book is in beautiful condition and the photograph is well done! I would say I am disappointed as I wanted a book with the characteristics of a Redhead not pictures.I guess I didn't read carfully.I have no use for this book,but it is not you fault.Is it returnable?Alice Bryant"
1,:(,"If you have a wide width foot and narrow heel as I do, these shoes are not for you.These shoes are super cute and you will get plenty of compliments. They go with just about every outfit you can think of. I absolutely adored them but when I wore them outdoors for the first time, I later came home with my feet full of blisters. They're extremely uncomfortable on me. They're probably better suited for those with narrow feet and wider heels. So if you walk well in shoes that have a narrow front, these are probably the shoes for you.They do run a little weird on size. I purchased an 8 and a half and my left shoe felt a bit too big. At times my foot would slide right out the shoe. I don't think an 8 would have helped since it probably would have been even tighter in the front, causing more pain on my toes.I wish they were built a bit better because I really did love these shoes. Unfortunately, I'll never have the pleasure of wearing them."
2,"Eh, looked cuter online and runs large.","I purchased the BCBGirls Jacinda shoe because they looked very cute online and I needed good ""walking"" shoes from the train to work before switching to my ""desk"" shoes. However, when I got them, I was a tad disappointed. They looked very cheap, like something I could get at Payless. Don't get me wrong...nothing wrong with Payless Shoes, but I just wasn't expecting $70-$80 shoes to look that cheap. Also, the fit is rather larger. I am *always* a perfect size 7.5. I am not ""between"" sizes, have wide or narrow feet, or whatever. However, the 7.5 in these shoes are rather large. There is about half a centimeter left over in the heel when I step into these, causing the shoe to pop off my heel when I walk. Maybe these shoes were made for people who wear thick socks, but that would look rather odd. But still, I have many other heels and flats where I don't wear socks and they fit fine."
4,"Great item, love the pink","It is a little light weight, plus I thought the Potato masher would be larger! Good fit for my hands and it works!"
1,Waffle Head Masher,My daughter has a pink kitchen utensil collection. I bought this through Amazon (Best Manufacturers)and was completely disappointed in the quality. Additionally it was in the box unwrapped and dirty. It looked as if it had been used. Very disappointing!
4,One for Piazzolla fans,"If you don't mind the operatic-style of singing, then these arrangements of Jobims's pieces will interest you. ""Canta mais"" is actually quite a nice arrangement on this album, as is ""Modinha"". But, nothing can compare with the original Jobim versions. The real treat is the Piazzolla. The orchestral arrangement of ""Muerte Del Angel"", ""Berceuse"" and ""Primavera Portena"" are so powerful you'll wet your pants.""Too late"""
5,"Sultry Voice, Excelent Musical Conception, Brazilian Soul","Angela Barra has one of Brazil's most sultry voices, both sensitive and passionate. Maestro Morozowicz has a brilliant musical conception of Guerra Peixe's arrangements and Tom Jobim's Music. Bragattos' settings are just cristal clear and faithful to Argentine's great Piazzolla."
5,Addition,"This is a wonderful addition to my collection. Notable song on this one is ""1492,"" she really works her voice. It is a little bit bitter then a dark note here with this one. There is also a sense of feminism, there's nothing wrong with that, I like that.view my review for ""In This Life, On This Road"""
5,Wonderfu,"I have found this to be one of the best commentary type books that I have read in a long time. Straightforward, unbiased, and time fullfilling. I have now ordered the 4th volume with Matthew thru Romans and can't wait to see if it compares to this one."
5,"Thru the Bible, Vol. 5:1 corinthians-Revelation","This author, J. Vernon McGee, writes this in such a way that you will learn and understand the Bible like never before.I have all five of these books and am really enjoying reading them."
4,shampoo great,love the shampoo. could be packaged better. bottle twisted open and spilled into plastic bag. had to clean everything before I could use it
1,poor construction/falss apart birdcage,"First of all, I thought I had already reviewed this product, but apparently not.The item was shipped right away in a box made in China. And, since I had an emergency need for the cage ( had a bird born with handicaps), and therefore had to use whatever was shipped, which is why I didn't ship back and complain.This cage is very poorly constructed, and I had to reinforce it with metal ties just to put it together. It kept falling apart Even with the reinforcement, the tray won't slide back and forth without the cage falling in on one side. I am very unhappy with this cage, and would not recommend it to anyone."
4,Finally one I will rave about..,"This I am using as a flight cage for finches. My Lady Gouldin's are doing fine in it and there is enough room to prevent squabbling. I have already ordered two more of these. BUT, re: the stand... read my review on that before you even think of buying it."
2,Dissapointed,"I only have one other of the Rarities series (Rarities II) and I loved it, but I was really dissapointed in Rarities V; to me it sounds very dry and stale, with no passion or emotion. Something is missing and I have yet to put my figner on it.I read somewhere that Rarities V captured what the album ""No Place Like Home"" should have sounded like, and if so, it tells me just how bad NPLH realy is.In defense of Rarities V, I must say that I gave it a listen just after my first time listening to Buffalo Skinners; the contrast is incredible, I think BS is awesome and to listen to Rarities V after BS is just not fair!"
1,the most racist man on earth...,"Paul mooney is always touching the race subject, and yes hes'messed all of em, and thats funny but up to a certain point..this sucker ALWAYS has to mention something racist..all the damm time. i think that hes more insecure of himself above everything.i liked him in chappele, but thats about it..yes we all know he speaks the truth and that america is full of racism, but joking about it all the time will not solve anything. racism is something very serious and people got killed, and are getting killed by it, and this fool is making jokes out of it. i think hes no good at all."
4,Analyzing White America,"There are some real laugh out loud moments on this DVD. Paul Mooney is very smart and quick and on the money most of the time. If you like comedy and have never heard of this man, take a chance, you won't regret it. A truly funny man at the top of his game!!"
4,Pretty funny,He is so funny and to keep that poker face through out his comedy routine is funny in its self.
2,Funny is as... not funny,I loved this guy in that other dudes show. But this stand up was not so funny. I guess it was funny back then but now our humor is a little different and I just could not enjoy his humor.
4,Mooney Is Too Deep For Haters (LITERAL Haters),"Paul Mooney is America's sociologist and he loves to tell the truth about race and kick a little tail along the way. It is not enough for him to be poignant, but he has to get a dig in along the way, and for those who rated this anything below 3, you might as well admit that either (1) It's too deep, or (2) Your well of hatred is. Funny that when the joke's on white America, they don't like it so much.There's a saying--""Throw a stick at a pack of dogs and the ones who run and yelp are the ones fearful of getting hit."" Or more precise, ""If the shoe fits, run from it!""Warning: Mooney carries more than a big stick. He's wielding a two-by-four!!!"
2,White people bashing at its best?,"The first time I ever noticed Paul Mooney was on Chappelle Show. I didn't realize he wrote for shows like In Living Color. He was brilliant on those 2 shows, however he may need to stick to writing and or doing small skits because his stand up is weak.The man has no charisma. He's too serious and can't deliver jokes properly. He can be a bit extreme and made me wonder if he really means what he says or he's just joking? I'm neither black or white, but all I can say is that if you're white you might want to watch and see what some black people find funny about you. And if you're black you probably will get a kick out of it. For me this DVD didn't hold my attention for too long. I turned it off after 30 minutes. I wouldn't recommend buying it, maybe a rental at best if you can find it. Although everyone's opinion about comedy is totally subjective, this one barely got a chuckle out of me."
2,Not his best,"As a big fan of ""Race"" and ""Masterpiece"", I was really disappointed by this video.They should have shot this in a club, not in the studio. Technically, it's pretty amateur looking and the audience doesn't feel ""present"".Content wise, it's not Mooney's best material. I found the whole show a bit flat.Mooney's still an original and well worth hearing though."
4,High Quality,"The Westcott brand of scissors are quickly becoming my favorite brand. I have not tried any that I didn't absolutely love, and these are no exception. They're sharp, and cut through anything like it was ""buttah."" An excellent, high-quality pair of scissors."
2,Might be ok for paper(?),"Bought them for a sewing class, specifically to use with fabric.I don't recommend them. It may just be there is a defect in the ones I was sent, but they don't work well with fabric."
3,slightly awkward shape,"I've used these only for paper and they are definitely sharp enough to tackle that simple job. But there's something not quite right about the shape of the handle. It's possible it's just me, but the grip doesn't feel comfortable. I always feel like my hands are a bit too small."
2,Not Impressed,"I, too, was impressed by the fact that these were TITANIUM blade scissors but after a few days of cutting with them they started to stick and not cut as smooth as when they came out of the package. I just purchased a pair of Scotch Precision Scissors, 8-Inches and not only were they HALF the price of the Westcott but they work like a dream and continue to do so for the month I have been using them. The smoothest cutting action Ive seen on a pair of scissors under $75.00."
3,ORDER DISCREPANCY,"We ordered this product expecting that we would receive 1 each of 2 different sizes of scissors; instead, we received 2 of the 8 inch size and none of the 5 inch size. Otherwise the scissors work VERY well and were technically everything we expected."
4,Sturdy,"I have used these scissors for several years now, and find them to much better than the stainless types. I use one pair in a professional crafting business, and another pair actually lives outside year round hanging on the gate post of my backyard garden. I have given these scissors much hard use including cutting plastic, cardboard, paper, all types of adhesive tape, thin wire pipe cleaners, paper mache'. This weekend I used them to cut through landscape fabric that has been on the ground with a thick layer of mulch and dirt. I didn't even move the dirt off of the fabric. Just stuck the scissors into the ground, lifted the fabric up and sliced 240' of dirty landscape fabric.....hung them on the gate for the next garden project.The handles are plastic with a nice rubber insert, they feel good in the hand, and the blades stay sharp. NEVER broke any of the handles. I will buy more....4 stars because they would have to cut all by themselves to get 5 stars out of me."
2,"Titanium Scissors, Cheap Plastic Handles","I bought two pairs of these scissors because they looked good and carried the promise of long-wearing titanium blades. The only problem is that the handles are made of cheap, thin plastic and rubber. They break easily if you exert any real cutting pressure. These would be ok for paper and other light duty uses, which is why they get 2 instead of 1 star. But I'd look elsewhere...and remember to keep your eye on the handle as well as the blade before you purchase!"
1,Terrible scissors,These scissors are terrible. I thought that my worst issue would be that the scissors have a weak area. The scissors haven't broken (yet) but they are terrible at cutting. They are dull and can barely cut through felt.
3,Works Fine... So Far,"You may think scissors are just scissors but these feel very nice to the hand, cut very well and seem to stay sharp longer than most. My inclination would be to give them a top score. However, I haven't had them for years... and scissors should last years.I'm wary of giving them them a higher rating because another review reported ""the plastic center axel into which the pivotal screw inserts broke - rendering the pair useless... seems like a critical place -- so why do they make it out of cheezy plastic?""Maybe they've fixed that. Maybe they haven't. I'm not going to break mine apart on purpose to find out. Now I feel like I'll have to be a little more careful about cutting things that are tough, despite the ""titanium."""
5,Outstanding: the whole Amazon experience,"I got these through the Amazon Vine program.I had been looking for a new pair of scissors (did Amazon know that, somehow?).So, I was quite surprised when they showed up as an option. I grabbed them as fast as I could, and am not a bit disappointed.They are light in weight, outstanding in performance. But it was the whole Amazon experience that continues to delight me. I think I received the scissors within 3 days of putting the order in, maybe 2 days.I am very, very impressed, and love Amazon."
5,Perfect For Crafts,A really comfortable ergonomic handle and sharp blades make these the perfect scissors for working with paper or cloth. I am using mine for cutting out quilt pieces and they are just the right size. I'm really happy to have these.They should be great for scrapbooking or any other paper crafts.
3,"nice scissors, not great","I like these scissors just fine, although I definitely prefer the handle of the Westcott Titanium Bonded Non Stick Scissors, 8"" Straight more than the handle of this scissor. However, (at current prices) you pay $8.77 for the handle I like and only $9.88 for TWO pairs of the handle I don't like. And I can't say that I hate the handle or anything. It's just that my hands have enjoyed other handles more. These scissors will be ones I let my kids use for their art projects--another moment where a pack of two scissors comes in handy: I've got two kids, so one for each. And the scissors do their job. They cut things as they should."
3,Great scissors while they last,"We have owned several pairs of these over the years and they are very nice. They're sharp and feel fine in the hand. However, like others, we have had a pair that simply fell apart because of the cheap way the two sides are held together. If you do buy them, avoid trying to cut the type of hard white plastic that is used to fasten things to cardboard backing in packaging."
4,Great scissors but a little smalle. Has life time warranty!,"These scissors have a nice sturdy feel to them. They are now a pair of my ""good"" scissors, the kind I don't let the kids use!Packaging says guaranteed for a lifetime- not sure what the specifics of that are though.My only complaint was that the hand grip seemed a tad small. I could put only three fingers in the larger oval shaped opening on the hand grip. I feel more stable if I can put all fingers through that area."
2,Sharp blades - Poor grip,"These are very sharp, but try and cut anything with any thickness and the grips break as they are not nearly as strong as the blades..."
4,"Good Scissors, Great Value","These Westcott scissors handle lightweight household and office tasks beautifully. Their sharp blades close smoothly along their full length to the very tip, with a level of tension that's adjustable via a tiny screw at the junction point. They feel balanced and comfortable to hold, nearly ambidextrous (slightly more suited to right-handers), with finger holes lined in a slightly rubbery material that keeps the scissors stable (vs. slipping) in the hand.If you deal with sticky materials and need scissors with nonstick blades, I highly recommend theTitanium Bonded Non Stick Scissors. But if you're looking for lightweight, general-purpose scissors, the quality and deeply discounted price of this two-pack makes these a great value."
1,Center Pivot Point Breaks With Moderate Stress,"I purchased this because I thought it would be sharp and durable. I was cutting the stems of roses, one at a time, when the two parts of the scissors fell apart. I would have thought the blade and pivot points, that obviously get the most wear and tear, would be titanium. Nope, the pivot point has a plastic nut which gave way. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link which, in this case, is plastic. The manufacturers should not claim this item to be titanium if one of its major wear and torque points is plastic. I was pleased with the sharpness of the blade portion but gave it a 1 star as I did not like being mislead into believing this was a titanium scissor."
3,Great for light use,"The blades of these scissors are very sharp, but not as sharp as my Scotch Precision scissors. They fit comfortably in the hand but if you try cutting anything beyond a few sheets of paper - anything that requires some extra torque, the handles will fail. There's a weak spot you can feel starting to give way if you try cutting thick cardboard, for example. For paper-only - these babies are nice - but I would not reserve these for paper-only use... and I would not attempt to cut through more than 2 sheets at a time. Sharp on cutting, but they fail when significant torque is required beyond 2 sheets of paper."
5,great scissors,"These scissors have comfortable handles with a little bit of a cushioned, rubbery feel. They cut well, with sharp blades that hold an edge well.They really do resist tape and stickiness better than other scissors! I have four pairs of these scissors because are are avid crafters. Basically we have a pair of scissors in each room. These are great all-purpose scissors that work for school, crafts, household needs."
1,Central pivot point broke,"Like a prior review mentioned, the central pivot point for the two blades is connected though plastic fittings. Mine broke at the pivot point while cutting off plastic ties around a package. The blades/titanium parts itself have been good, but it's pretty useless now except as a letter opener..."
1,No Longer as Good as They Used to Be,"The ""new handle design"" translates to ""thinner, easier to break design"". One drop that lands on the floor in the right way will break the handle. I have many with the old design handles, and you could abuse the heck out of them, and they'd stand up to the abuse.Also, along with the thinner handle, the blades on these are thinner, too. Easier to bend. Not as durable as the older models.Essentially, Westcott has cheapened their scissors to the point that I can no longer recommend them.I would suggest the Scotch brand titanium scissors as an alternative."
3,Decent enough,"These scissors are much like the several others that I have: they cut well but also hurt my fingers. The hard surfaces have a way of applying pressure to the wrong parts of my fingers when I open the blades. From the picture, it looks like the inside of the finger holes might be soft and pleasant. Instead, they are merely a different color. Despite the product description, I don't feel anything soft about these scissors.These scissors cut more evenly than theWestcott Titanium Bonded Non Stick Scissors, 8"" Straightthat I also got from Amazon Vine, needing consistent pressure throughout the cut. I'd choose these over the non-stick scissors."
3,Good Scissors,"These scissors are as advertised when new. Sharp and cuts most items well. I even took hard cards and doubled them up and these scissors had no trouble with clean cuts. As other reviews have mentioned (and I had a pair before) they do not last long. Which is ironic since my old scissors are still usable after a decade and they are standard steel. These scissors have a adjustable pivot for tension control that can be tighten if needed by a small screwdriver. They also come with a ""Lifetime Warranty"" which is not a guarantee and is actually a a limited lifetime warranty. I use these on paper, photo stock and cardboard. At the present time they work."
5,Great scissors!,"These are great scissors! I tried them on paper of course, as expected they cut it. Now for harder tests, They shined! Hair, tissues, plastic packaging, are passed. Only time will tell if they will hold up. They look well made, so I think they will. I am left-handed and they pass the comfort test also. Ambidextrous design should serve all well."
3,Cheap scissors for light duty tasks,"These Wescott scissors are comfortable in the hand and very lightweight. They work well for small cutting tasks, piece of paper, string, etc.Unfortunately, light in this case translates into lightly made. They have a moderate amount of flex in them, are not very sharp and are simply not made to hold up to heavy, or precise cutting tasks. If you have multiple dedicated scissors you might have room for one more. If, however, you need more of an all-rounder, I would look elsewhere."
4,Titanium scissors - what a great invention!,"This is the second pair of titanium scissors I have reviewed for Amazon Vine. The other pair came fromScotch. I have used both scissors in my kitchen for several months, and they both work great. They are very strong, and they don't get sticky like steel scissors do when you cut tape or labels, or my favorite sticky item, dates. They don't bend or break or get dull, or get loose, or have any poor qualities that I have noticed. The only difference I noticed between the Westcott scissors and the Scotch scissors is, the Westcott scissors became a little stained over time. The Scotch scissors are still shiny black and look like new. The Westcott scissors started out silvery and now have sort of wavy patterns of metallic stain. It doesn't affect the use of the scissors at all. These are still great scissors, and I am convinced titanium is the way to go. What a great invention! Titanium scissors -- try a pair, you will love them."
4,Light and Easy to Handle,"These scissors are easy to handle and nicely sharp. So far they have not corroded -- even though I have washed them several times -- which is a nice feature. Since they are straight scissors, they are best for uses such as cutting paper, cardboard, etc.. but they work well and the price is right."
4,Sharp.,"These scissors are sharp and sturdy enough for standard cutting of paper and fabric. I cut through thick plastic and cardboard quite easily with no problems so far.However, what is bothersome is the handles. I have fairly small hands but these handles seem extremely small, almost for kids instead of adults. The rubberized grips are nice, but the size should be a bit larger as my hand feels rather cramped inside.For the price (under 10 bucks at the time of this writing), you get two pairs and that's a pretty good deal when compared to other manufacturers for only one pair."
1,Good until they break,"I have been buying these scissors for years at a large retailer. The blades are a good quality. However, the attachment piece between the two halves is plastic. It does not hold up well. Over time the scissors simply break at the plastic attachment piece in the middle. I certainly wish the entire scissors were titanium.I am out here on Amazon trying to find some METAL scissors."
1,Pivot Rusted and broke,"I willingly paid a few bucks more for what I expected to be a quality product. I bought them about a year ago, and was pleased with them, but yesterday I went to cut a piece of paper and they fell apart! The pivot pin was all rusted!What good is the titanium if the hidden pin rusts? For this to be a quality product, it needs a stainless steel pivot. Maybe the packaging should say, Titanium"", and other metals which are subject to corrosion? Would you buy it then?I think the plastic caps trap water, leading to this rusting. I ended up pushing out the pin and cutting a #8 machine screw to fit, not really worth the time and effort, but at least I have a working scissors now.Anyone know of a true quality scissors that can be expected to last a lifetime? No reason for a scissors not to, assuming it is not abused."
2,Not what I was hoping for.,"Poorly arranged versions of the music. I ordered this to get a jump start on a production I'm doing since the score isn't available, but it's pretty useless as far as giving info about the real versions of the songs."
1,dvd is defective!!! beware!!!,"i've bought this dvd via best buy and it was defective. would not play on any of my 3 dvd players. i returned it for another and same story. so there's a batch out there that is defective, so buyer beware!!!!! it's sad that they did not check out the disc more, this could have been prevented. it is ntsc all region dvd."
5,Jeff Is Back!,"BONE's silly fun has returned! The one thing that bothered me about GHOST CIRCLES was the lack of humor, but Jeff Smith has made BONE hilarious again. Gran'ma, Thorn, and the bones have reached the ancient city of Atheia, which is now packed with the survivors of the ghost circles. However, they find out that corruption has taken hold even in the capital city. A new branch of Veni-Yan-Cari (holy men loyal to the dragons) has sprung up and refused to bow to the dragons. Their leader, Tarsil, has assumed control of Atheia and will not let anyone loyal to the dragons live in peace.All cities have currency, and, of course, Phoney's just aching for a bundle. Once again using Smiley as his assistant, he's trying to locate Tarsil's legendary treasure. Packed with humor, horror (the scene with Thorn walking toward the shadow, oooh scary), and a cliffhanger ending that will leave you groping for CROWN OF HORNS, BONE is back with more!"
3,Not Quite Off Road,"Crocs are exceedingly popular shoes. They are stylish, light, and comfortable. But they are not truly meant for off road travel. I used a pair of these hiking in Yosemite over Labor Day weekend. They were fun to wear, but even on well established trails one frequently has to stop to remove small rocks and gravel that are trapped between your foot and sole. I wear these mostly for casual walking now. If you want to ""look"" both rugged and stylish, by all means get a pair. But for real hiking, HiTecs are still the best."
4,Dingo mini-bones,Our dogs love these....two comments: 1)Walgreens stores has these $10 a bag everyday price; 2)more waste than I'd like..there's always one end that has to get thrown away to avoid choking hazard.
2,Dingo Mini Bones,"These were made in China so not sure of the quality of them. They got stuck in my dog's mouth and he had a hard time getting it loose. When I tried to help him, he didn't want me to take it. Don't think I'll get them again."
2,Dog loves them...I don't,"My dog loves these. However, he was eating one and went to bark while it was in his mouth and almost chocked. It was terrifying and I am now afraid that they are so small, even for an 18 pound dog. I coninue to buy dingo, just not these minis."
5,Dog Treats,"My 2 dogs are addicted to these!! They get one a day, when I come home from work...needless to say, they are always excited to see me come home!!!"
5,Our Doxies Love these,"It's true, our miniature dachshunds absolutely love these. They are a special treat for them. Unfortunately, they go through them fairly quickly, but it's their absolute favorite!"
1,made in China,"I am looking for rawhide bones such as these made in the USA. The Dingo bones appeared on the screen. These are not made in the USA, but China. There are recent problems with dog treats made in China causing kidney failure. Amazon, you get an ""F"" on this!"
1,Careful! Dogs can CHOKE and DIE on these!,"My 5 month old french bulldog puppy almost died on the first bone tonight. He chewed it down and attempted to swallow a piece that was too big to go down his throat. When he began gagging and throwing up I had to stick my hand down his throat to push the lodged bone into his stomach. VERY scary and upset me greatly. I do NOT recommend these bones. There is even a choking warning on the back in small writing. Keep your pet safe and purchase MUCH BIGGER bones for them, and take away anything too small so they cannot choke or get hurt."
3,My dog only likes the filling,"My dog Ewok enjoys these Dingos very much...for about 1 day. As soon as he has chewed all the red filling out, leave all the tiny pieces all over my apartment and inside my rug, he is done with it. He does seem to enjoy it immensely so I am giving it 3 stars."
1,DANGEROUS BONES!!!!,DANGEROUS BONES!!! Little dogs love these bones because they are tasty BUT they are truly dangerous. Our family Maltese (Pebbles) who had just turned one choked to death on one. They are not even safe if your supervising your dog because our dog choked on one in the presence of my sister. We were unable to do anything for her as we watched in horror as she slowly stopped breathing and got her to the vet in less than ten minutes. The vet attempted an emergency procedure and removed two peices and the bone had also tore her trachea. Her death was caused by these bones. These bones are not worth your precious pets life as it tore our family apart.
1,My dog nearly died last night,"I was skeptical to give my yorkie rawhides but my vet said it would be okay. These were the only treats that would keep him entertained since he doesn't care much for toys and they were very easy to find. Unfortunately my dog seemed to swallow a large piece of the mini dingo rawhides yesterday. At 2 am I heard my dog let out a loud howl that I have never heard before, I went to check on him and found him gagging and obviously trying to throw something up. Right as I was about to take him to the animal hospital he threw up the rawhide and he's all better now. I'm NEVER giving him a rawhide treat, they swell in the dog's stomach and can kill them. I rather not take that risk with my dog."
1,DANGER DANGER,I just lost my dog of 14 years to a Dingo bone. She choked to death last night. I rushed her to a emergency vet clinic but it was too late. She was a Shih Tzu so beware if you have a small dog and you give them these. She ate Dingo bones as a treat all of her life and never had a problem. I have another dog and just threw out 4 bags of these. NEVER AGAIN WILL I BUY THESE for my dog.
2,Took ttooooooooooo long to recieve this order,"Although this is exactly what I had wanted however I had paid for 3 to 5 shipping and to get the item rushed, the company did not do as instructed,,,,,very disappointed. I would not order from them again"
4,Good bones.,"The dogs enjoy these bones. The dogs are good dogs, and they get the Dingo bones for being good dogs."
4,21 pack vs 35 pack,"Go with this pack if you are doing the math. The 35-pack actually costs you more. Our dogs love the mini-dingo's, but again do the math and you'll find (at least IMHO with Amazon Prime) that you come out better if you're ordering in volume."
5,My little dogs fave!,"First, I must say I only give rawhide when I can supervise the dogs, just to make sure no one chokes. That being said, these are a huge treat for my 4 small dogs. They love them. Dingo is the only brand of rawhide I buy now. Even for the larger bones for my Border Collie, I buy Dingo. Rare that I find a treat they all enjoy, and my dogs can be such snobs."
1,MADE IN CHINA,"I was looking for dog treats on Amazon that aren't made in China and Dingo came up. I've checked this brand before and unless they've changed where they manufacture Dingo's from, they care made in China."
1,Another product made in China,Chinese made products are beyond questionable when it comes to dog edibles. I was disappointed to read these too are China made. My dog's health and life is worth a more. I will stick to non toxic and good quality controlled foods for my dogs.
2,Too much RED DYE!!,"I didn't wanted to buy anything that was made with rawhide but a friend gave my pup a Dingo and he loved it. So I forced myself and brought my first bag of Dingo Dental Bones a month ago. Stitch loved it! I loved it too because he actually spent a good 45 minutes~2 hours on a Dingo Dental Bone. I didn't really like the red dye in the chicken meat but it wasn't overwhelming. If you actually crack a piece of the chicken off you can still see some non-dyed chicken.So I ordered a second bag of Dingo, just the original red package. The red dye was so strong that the whole piece of chicken was blood red and it even DYED the rawhide pinkish red!! It's kind of ridiculous to dye something the dog can smell! It's not necessary as long it tastes delicious.Anyhow I am on the search for something else, hopefully a better alternative other than Dingos.At least it wasn't made in China."
5,they love them,"My dogs absolutely love these! They are a bit pricey but seem to be good quality. Thanks dingo!! I have small dogs. If you have larger dogs, get bigger bones!"
5,Dingo Mini Bones 21-Pack,"These treats are a good ""diversion"" for our little Shih-Tzu while we are eating our meals. This is also a free shipping item on Amazon which we appreciate. The price is right also."
4,Yekutiel's case against disease eradication,"Like many malariologists, Prof. Yekutiel takes a skeptical view of global eradication programmes. However, events are showing that, at least for polio, his scientific skepticism is poorly justified.His account of the origins of the global malaria campaign is invaluable to students of infectious disease epidemiology and control. So, too, is his list of the prerequisites for infectious disease eradication. But he overestimates the technical obstacles to disease eradication for polio and measles, both of which have been cleared from countries and continents, with polio almost eradicated and measles just around the corner.With that much said, his typology of criteria is still useful, and his book is still quoted in symposia on disease eradication, like that recently published in the Bulletin of the WHO."
4,Get This Book,This is a great book to own if you are a first time player of Shadowrun. Though it has its flaws I definately reccomend getting this book. It can really give you some good ideas for runs and it has is chock full of info. Not to mention the fact that it has a lot of cool artwork.
5,Timeless collection of Literature,"I bought this book to replace an old, falling-apart edition that I had in my college years, which I have loved to pieces, LITERALLY.This edition is slimmer than my ancient edition, but it appears to have every poem.If you enjoy reading POETRY you will love this treasured collection."
1,bad choice,We bought this for Christmas last year and it already doesn't work. It was never droped or mistreated. It just stopped working. Now I to buy another TV for my daughter.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!,I bought this T.V for my daughter hoping it would last her for years and after only to months it quit. When I say quit I mean the screen turned green and you could not get a picture whatsoever just sound. It was so dissapointing being as you can't fine tube t.v's anymore needless to say her dissappointment. Don't buy the dvd player that matches it either same thing.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TV,"We bought this tv for my daughters birthday on July 3rd. By Aug. 1st the tv was broken! We started smelling something burning, enough for the smoke alarms in the house to go off! Now, mind you, this tv is in my daughter bedroom!! We went to turn it on and the screen came up and then it fades to blue! Very cute tv, but very much NOT worth the money for only 1 month of use!"
2,"mono speaker and a line 2"" from the top","I didn't realize it was mono , not stereo, thus the dvd player gets only the white cord plugged in :(...... the red just dangles in the wind.Then it has a 2"" darker area running horizontal. So not too thrilled...But all it all its cute for my 4 year old girl... they love it."
1,What a hunk of junk,"So we bought this as our daughters (BIG) Christmas present last year. A month later, the picture completely quit. Not happy at all with this product. Waste of money."
4,Great TV,"I was very pleasantly surprised at the wonderful picture from this TV. My daughter loves this TV and the fact that it's Barbie just makes it that much more special for her.The only negative I've found is that the red dot on the TV goes on when the TV is off and turns off when the TV is on.....kinda backwards in my opinion.But other than that, this was a great TV for my young daughter."
2,eh....,"This book gets a solid ""eh"" from me. It discusses ambition and gives some leadership tips and how to get to a leadership point in your career, but there are many other books out there which provide better tips like ""inspiring leader"" which can help you motivate a lot better."
5,"Bring me the Black Beauty, Kato","The Green Hornet is a staple of old time radio. Fans of the Hornet will enjoy these shows from 1946. They may be over 60 years old and were fun to listen to. The old shows have clear masters , but the sound quality of older shows were never the greatest sound quality. CD were not ever thought of sixty years agoSo do these shows hold up? SURE. If you have a few hours to enjoy, this is great entertainment that would tax your brain and will give you a sense of the good old days of radioI would love to see someone try to do a new versionof these old shows, but most have forgotten old radio...Ah ProgressBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
4,Green Hornet Rides Again,"For those of us who remember even vaguely the old radio dramas, this is truly a slice of childhood memories. It's been decades since I last heard a snippet of this old series; listening to these CD's brought it all back to life. The audio is clear and the sound effects convincing. The best part is that it brings back to life one of the larger-than-life heroes of my childhood. Highly recommended to those of us 50 & older; and a good listen to those younger who would like to hear how radio drama in it's heyday really sounded."
5,Fatima good religious reading,This is the second time I purchased this book. It is a wonderful true story of an event that happened in 1917 that was witnessed by over a hundred thousand people. Once you start reading the author brings you into the story as if you are right there experiencing the Sign yourself. I would recommend this book to anyone.
5,Should be required reading for every high school student,"When I first read Susan's book ,many years ago, I wondered how she managed to write a book exposing every raw nerve in her body. But I know why...she saw a chance to shine light on the very complex problem of teen suicide and to help people prevent and understand this tragedy. As far as I am concerned every young person and parent should read this book...it is well written and deals with this problem in a very human and honest way. The lady shows great courage in letting the world see her pain so maybe insight can be gained."
3,Potential death trap for birds,"This is a sturdy and quality feeder but we have a problem with small birds getting their little heads trapped in the feeder holes on bottom tray! We have had to rescue two birds and cut the metal as they became trapped after going in too far for food. I am sure the company will not change the design based upon that, but it just a potential problem. We have not had any other quality issues."
2,"Well designed, but the color fades","Had it a few months and now the color has faded a lot, so much that especially the top/lip portion looks almost pink. Well designed otherwise. Best part is that it's easy to refill. Seeds do fall out often, as birds are feeding, makes a mess below. For us, it has attracted only House Finches and House Sparrows. Nothing larger seems comfortable on it. I don't know if it's worth re-spray painting it again someday. I will probably move on to another style that suits larger birds as well. I think 2 1/2 stars would be most fair."
1,Waste of money,"This feeder is really big -- it holds 15lbs of seed. I thought that would be a good thing......well not for me. I hang my feeders on a shepherd's hook and 15lbs was too much and bent my wrought iron hook. PLUS, it was missing a washer and cotter pin for one side to hang the feeder. I improvised, but I don't think it will hold out. The suet holders are not designed well, as a squirrel figured out how to open and bent the flap that secures the feeder --- so now it blows in the wind. After 4 days, I'm ready to throw this thing out."
1,Stay Away!,"I can not recommend this feeder. It's fine for small birds, but the cardinals and bluejays were bothered by it. It took them a full 2 weeks to figure out how to land on it. Sounds bizarre, but true, nonetheless. Perhaps the problem is the color - bright red! Stay away from this one."
3,Squirrel Proof?,"When I ordered this I thought it was squirrel proof. It is built out of metal and quite sturdy but the squirrels love it. The one I had previously had a lever that when the squirrels jumped on it it shut the feeder bins and the the squirrels couldn't get to the feed. That's the one I thought I was ordering.I still enjoy it, just have to constantly scare the squirrels out of it."
4,"Looks Good, Works Well","The bird feeder turned out to be a little larger than we had anticipated, but it still works well and should last a long time. The birds took a couple weeks to get used to it, but are now using it freely. The 'clinging' birds have a little trouble landing on it as compared to the all wooden feeder (homemade) that it replaced because they can't dig their claws into the metal; but are learning to land on the suet feeder cages and then hop to the feeding rail if they want to. The main advantage of this feeder is when it's hot and the suet starts dripping grease, it doesn't soak into the wood and make a mess like it does with the wood feeder. The only negative would be that the suet cages are a little too deep, making it difficult for birds with short beaks to get to the suet. However, a 1/2"" to 3/4"" chunk of styrofoam behind the suet holds it out against the cage nicely. A good product, at a decent price."
4,Good but not great,If you are looking for a basic bird feeder that you plan on hanging from its included hook then it should satisfy. However I will not give it a 5 star rating based upon the fact it says it can be pole mounted. They fail to mention that the necessary hardware is not included and without this it cannot be mounted on a pole. I was fortunate to have an old bird feeder that was pole mounted. I removed the bracket off it and installed it on the new feeder. Also just a another thing to be aware of is that you cannot adjust it to weight. So if you have squirrels in your backyard it will not close to prevent them from eating the seed.
3,"Great size, cheap quality...","I love the size and look of this feeder, but the metal seems to be really cheap. You sneeze on it wrong and it bends and dents. My husband only had taken it outside to attach the pole adapter piece to it and the roof had broke on it. Since I paid so much for it, I fixed it and it is working well, we will just have to care for this with gentle hands. I would not recommend this due to the material, I am not expecting titanium here, but just really think it should be a bit heavier duty...It should not bend easily with your bare hands!"
4,Bird feeder,"We like the way both sides are used by the birds. Squirrels still try to get at it and had to install a squirrel baffel. We had thought the perches dropped if a squirrel did get on it, but oh well it works and the birds love the suet blocks available on both sides."
1,I was deceived and cheated by Quality Distributing LLC,"The company who sold these mis-represented them. In the picture they have 4 screw holes per plate and that is exactly why I bought them. In reality, these have three screw holes per plate which is useless to me! I was hoping to get the ones initially represented because the screw holes on my hinges are stripped. I did not feel like repairing the holes, using these would put the mounting holes in virgin wood. They recently changed the picture on Amazon, as well as the price (lower) But they can not change the picture in my invoice. I expect the proper (or substitute) ones to be sent. I will amend my poor rating only if I am made whole."
2,A lot to learn,"A lot to learnThe Alphabet Verses the GhettoBy Jessica Care MooreI really did not care for the book. Jessica Moore intensifies the argument of what is Black. People argue about rather or not Jesus is Black, well, Jessica suggests that the alphabet is black. Jessica takes language and glorifies each letter of the alphabet. However, there are some moments in the book where I was lost and I had to re-read over and over again to try and understand. She makes learning seem culturally fun and enriching. Jessica is clearly no amateur to the poetry world. She has taking her place on the throne of language arts. The Alphabet Verses the Ghetto compliments the best of both the alphabet and the ghetto, it just takes a long time to get there. I would not recommend the reading to anyone."
1,The Alphabet Versus Spoken Word,"I read this book twice. The first time I read it, it struck me as under-developed and simplistic. The second time I read it, I couldn't even get past the first twelve pages. Although Care Moore obviously has talent, it is cloaked/hidden in poor syntax/ poor use of literary devices. In addition, her language can be somewhat clumsy at times, for example:""there are moments death is loving youmoves into your house.""In this instance, the first line could have real power, but the second line is inconsistent with the subject, and ruins everything. Not the worst money I've ever spent, but my copy is going to a used bookstore real soon."
4,Well made and soft.,My daughter loved it. it was well made and soft. There was also alot of detail in the design and the eyes.
4,Chronology,Love this CD. David Meece has a great voice and really get to the heart of Christian faith. I purchased this a long time ago on cassette. Very hapy to find it on CD
5,"She-Ra Princess of Power Season one, Vol. 1",I am really pleased with my purchase. I loved this cartoon series as a kid and would recommend this series to any fan of He-Man and She-Ra.
4,a trip back to the 80s,"I remember watching She-ra when i was a kid. It was a good show then and is a good show now. Honestly I think it even more enjoyable now that I'm an adult because I can appreciate it more, and understand all the little jokes in the show. Its great for nostalgia, and great for watching with the family. I recommend this DVD set."
1,missing dics,i love the show but when i ordered this product I was missing the last 2 discs from the series I didnt contact them in time because i was giving for a gift and was unable to return very disappointed
5,"GREAT SHOW, GREAT PACKAGING, GREAT QUALITY!","Of course this show gets all 5 stars. It is a classic. As a child I was facinated by She-Ra and her twin brother, He-Man. How many times did I raise my sword and chant, ""For the Honor of Greyskull... I am She-Ra!""? They just do not take the time to animate any more. Have you seen cartoons on TV these days. They are soooooo generic, and sloppy! Well most anyways! This show did not only contain great animation, but great story lines as well.Now for the packaging. It is great. There is a different character on every CD and the art is beautiful. Some of the best packaging I've ever seen for any DVD collection out there!It is a must get for original fans, and even New Ones!"
3,Brings back memories,The DVDs are great. The only complain I have when I put it in Spanish it jumps back and forth from Spanish to English. Then the audio track runs behind the video. This only happend on the first episode. Other than that I am happy with it.
1,Upset,I never received my order. I only received the envelope that it was packaged in with a note from the Post Office. I spoke with the post office and they told me that the vendor did not properly package the product and it had been lost. I have since emailed through amazon the vendor (newbury comics) and I have not even received a response!
3,HE-MAN'S SISTER!,The show is good but the dvd is bad in a few ways. There is staic in betreen each epersode and one of the epersodes dosn't even show. I sent it back to get a repacement and that one had the same prubums. I then sent it back to get a refund. I guess they all are defected.
5,Mysterious!!,"Winner of theSLATE Award for ""Best Score""by Mark Wolfram(at the 2002 California Independent Film Festival)Angular and thought provoking music which underscores a dark tale of political intrigue and personal tragedy.Original score composed & conducted byMark Wolfram featuring members of theHollywood Studio Symphony."
5,An Excellent accounting book,"This book is truly an amazing accounting text. I used the 19th edition to teach to studens of Master in International Bussiness. Higly didactic and very well explained. Maybe the best basically accountancy book I ever used.Manuel Evia, CPA, MsF"
3,Poor performance!,"This product looked good on line and the price was right, however after the second use one of the lights stoped working. Replacment light was sent right-a-way, however returning stuff on-line is a hassle."
2,Stopped working after five uses,I bought these LEDs because my car puts out low voltage power in the tail lights. They worked fine at first. But after a few times lowering my boat into the the water I noticed the several lights not working. On further inspection I realized the lights were full of water. I drained and dried them but now only one or two lights work. I checked the ground and everything looks fine so it must be the lights. They look pretty rusted out. Not very submersible if you ask me.
3,"Good kit, but priced high on Amazon","The kit is good, but if you are a novice DIYer, buy from a local company who can help you with adapter parts. The plug connector to my vehicle's wiring is a different receptacle so I had to purchase a $5 adapter from U-Haul. And that is when and where I found the same kit at 40% cheaper than the Amazon price. So shop around first......"
5,Great upgrade from my crappy motorcycle trailer lights,These were an easy install and they work great. Much brighter than the original. Well made and a good bargain.
5,bubblegumcandypop,Great record.Several great songs to keep you toes tapping and pop hooks so sweet your teeth hurt.
5,One of her best...,"I'm a huge fan of Blumchen, but this, Verliebt and her first album, Herzfrequenz, are her best in my opinion. Peppy, very fast songs are her signature. I have a friend who normally listens to Korn, Rage Against the Machine, etc, but likes to listen to Blumchen to 'take a break' from that hard stuff. Nearly all of her songs are light hearted, singing about how much she is in love, and when she's not singing about that, she's singing about how much she misses her true love. I'd highly recommend this album (and Herzfrequenz though it's hard to find!). Die Welt Gehort Dir I didn't like as much."
5,One of the best German happy hardcore,"Blümchen is one of the best representatives from the German happy hardcore scene like Dune or Scooter. Her voice is captivating and the beats are fast. Like her first CD it is suitable from private enjoyment up to big raves. So ravers, come and go to buy her CDs."
5,WOW! JUST WAIT FOR THE NEW ONE!,"OK I love blumchen! she is the best i have ever heard! Verliebt rocks and all the other ones are just the bomb! i just cant wait for her new album called ""Die Welt Gehört Dir"" ( the world belongs to you) I say buying all her albums is deffinetly worth it. I just ordered her Live in Berlin cd. and as soon as i find the new one out on the 26 of June 2000. Im making sure im going to have it! well all i have to say is Ich liebe dich Blumchen! Je t'aime...and i love you blumchen! ThanX :)"
4,German Happy Hardcore comes full circle,"Blumchen is now retired as far as I know. Starting her career at the tender age of 16, her heartfelt voice was heard all over Europe. She did release an english version of her first album, but didn't make any sales here in North America because the general population doesn't understand good music unless the artist gets half naked on the cover. Musically speaking, the songs follow a similar rhythem of happy hardcore and dance style beats. This formula works for a while, but Blumchen was wise NOT to go the same route with all of her CD releases. As far as lyrics go there really is nothing that stands out here. But thats ok as well. Sometimes it's nice to listen to music that doesn't cater to politics or world peace or gender bashing. So pop her in for a listen, it's godo stuff."
5,Most inspiring book ever,"Everyone should read this book, no matter what their religious belief is. It's not about religion, it's about life and death and it presents an incredibly inspiring theory about life after life. The fact that the story is based on a real historical event such 9/11, allows this book to take the reader through such an emotional journey that feels shockingly real. It makes you think, it makes you change the way you look at life and death and makes you re think about the time we have to spend in this world. Quite possibly, the best book I've ever read."
5,Jensen Vm9312 7-Inch Motorized Touch Screen Multimedia Receiver,product received in good time and we liked it because it was requested by me to give away and use
1,Wrong Item,I got a big problem about the item sent to me. I ordered Jensen Vm9312 7-Inch Motorized Touch Screen Multimedia Receiver but instead I received Jensen VM9311ts. I really want the item I ordered. I even spent extra shipping for this item since you don't deliver to an FPO AP address and I had it delivered to my home address in the US and shouldered the additional shipping fee for delivering it to my current address. I'm very much disappointed and I won't order again from this vendor. You should review and double check the item first before sending to the consumer.
2,nice,Nice for the price the only thing that I was not happy with is that it did not come with a remote the wiering hornis or sat radio hook ups or anything and when I found a wirering hornis for 24the bucks plus shipping the touch screen did not work. Not very happy with this buy.
2,You get what you pay for,"This unit is basically terrible. First, when playing a CD at low volumes, i can hear the radio in the background. Also, the sound quality of my subwoofer is terrible compared to my Pioneer CD Player. Another thing that disappoints me is that nearly every CD i put in this thing skips. Ill be watching a video on a brand new DVD, literally straight out of the box, and itll skip. I hope the 9412 model fixes all this, but i am not willing to try another Jensen. Go big or go home!"
5,Wonderful CD,"This is the best album of Sá & Gurabyra's carrer. The songs bring us marvelous memories from Minas Gerais, a wonderful state in Brasil, full of typical food, friendly people and art. Everybody should hear this album."
5,Great Novel for all readers,"""Having read ""The Wishing Well"" twice allows me the right to loudly proclaim that it is a great book! It is a book that you don't want to put down until you've seen to it that the children are safe. My adult son read the book over Christmas, really liked it, and his daughter is now enjoying the privilege. I rate it easily a 5."""
5,This is a totally awesome book!,Every Buffy fan should take a look at this book. It is very detailed and if you're the ultimate Buffy fan like I am and try not to ever miss a book or an episode then you should get your hands on this book. You might reconize the stories because they are episodes. I think that this is a real must for all Buffy fans! You should'nt be without it!
5,If you missed the episodes this is the book to read,I missed the entire first two seasons of Buffy and I read this book and it helps to explain a lot.Read it if you love the Angel character or missed the episodes.
3,Interesting,"This was a good book, but some stories didn't really have to do with Angel, but just with Buffy. Its great if you didn't catch a line in an episode, everythings there, including the characters thoughts."
2,Nothing new,"When I first heard about The Angel Chronicles, I was excited! At last! One of the Buffy books would be including Angel. Maybe we'd finally get some insight into the guy! Instead, we just get a repeat of three episodes! There was nothing wrong with the writing. I thought that Nancy Holder did a great job descriping the episodes, but I was really hoping for something different - like maybe the stories being told from Angel's point of view."
3,"It was mildly ok, but it was just like the eposodes.","It could have been better. All they did was spit out the lines from the show. If you have seen the show the book gets boring. Who wants to read something that they already know. The reason I gave this book three stars was because it is the only book so far that has Angel in it. I'm definatly an Angel fan. The book had no insight into what the charecters were thinking when they said the lines, which was very dissapointing. I had expected feeling. I would much rather read a book that contains new Angel information or missing parts between each eposode."
5,The most dangoures love story of all time ...,"Sixteen year old Buffy Summers is theadup with beying a Slayer . Even though she has sworen to kill all Vampiers every were , she ends up meating Angel . A 214 yearold Vampier . Who became a Vampier hundrends years ago back in Scotlaned .Now she relizes that shes falling in love with him ."
5,Fantastic - more in depth look at some of my fave episodes,"I really enjoyed this book not only because it contained some of my favorite episodes but also because you get to see what each of the characters are thinking - something you don't hear when you are watching the show!! I thought that this book would be aimed at younger readers as I am 24, but I was pleasantly surprised it followed the same lines as the show and was really interesting. The only thing is that you can read it in one sitting because the print is very large and it's a pretty thin book."
1,it's like writing the story you watched on TV,"At the risk of sounding like a fanboy, I don't know how many writers are capable of capturing the magic of a Joss Whedon story on paper. I'm not even sure Whedon can do it. The book is just a regurgitation of 3 episodes, but without, as another commenter wrote, the magic. If you never saw the show, I'm sure you can find the transcripts online somewhere. Fight vampires if you have to to get to them, but it'll be worth it."
5,the Number one episode book for BTVS,i live in australia and so far we've nearly finished season three but the show keeps on being taken of the t.v. i have every single episode to the show on video besides the first 8 in season one so i decided to by all of these books. i now have both the Angel Chronicles and they are the best. So descripted and intriguing. i also have other BTVS reading books and the Watchers Guide. I couldn't live without my BUFFY THE VAMPIR SLAYER BOOK.
5,"It was really cool, I've already reread it three times.","The book was realy cool. I love Angle and I missed the first couple of episods so I went out and bought Buffy # 1,2,3,4,5 and the Angle Chronical. I can easily say it was my favorite. I loved learning how they got together. I would recammend this book to anyone."
3,A light-weight racket that is well balanced,"This racket is reasonably light at 155g, with a focus on speed over control. The rubber is thin and has little grip. It is not a high-end equipment, but at this price, it is hard to do much better."
2,Tsunami Table Tennis Racket - very heavy,"I am a good amateur ping-pong player, I am playing in my basement very often and I understand pretty well what is a good racket.This racket has good surfaces and it spins the ball very well. These surfaces are laying on the solid wood base, which makes this racket very heavy.The base should be made from the slices of wood and other light materials and should be light. I am playing with Joola racket which is much lighter.I would not recommend this racket even for the beginner."
2,Not for inside the home,"First of all, these smell awful. The fake smoked scent stays with your dog long after the treat disappears. In addition, these are very messy and the color comes right off and stains the carpet."
3,"Dogs like this, but ...","My two Golden Retrievers like these a lot, but they are expensive and they disappear very quickly. I prefer chews that last longer."
2,How can you go wrong with this line up? Thanks for answering!,Really bad except for a few moments of humorous lyrics.
5,Olatunji's Best Album Since Drums of Passion!,"Why this album was released on such a tiny label remains such a mystery! The CD insert doesn't even have a bar code! But if you are a fan of Olatunji, this is a must-have album! Olatunji speaks in English and sings in his native language of Yoruba, making this album such a treat!"
4,Okay so far....,"I was happy to find these batteries as my product is out of date. So far they are working good, but... it seems I have to charge these batteries every 7-10 days whether I use them or not. I was hoping to get a longer life from them"
5,"Fit's in perfectly, replaces original.","Excellent product. It was shipped very fast. I got it and installed it in less than 30 seconds. It does not stick out of the back, it's the same size as the original and the same color too so you cannot tell the difference. Lasts a bit longer as well.Well worth the money for those who don't want the odd batteries that stick out of the back.Seller offers timely responses to email questions."
5,Adorable plush horse - and not just for kids!,"I bought this darling Indian pony for my elderly mother who's currently in a rehab nursing home. We're a horse family and this little fellow will make her room feel more like home. His coloring is adorable and he's just the right size and softness for her to keep in or on bed with her (one description calls him floppy, but he's not, thank goodness). My only disappointment is that the feather that's both pictured on his bridle and in some ads mentioned as being included, was not."
5,Nothing more to ask for in a Powerline adapter!,"This is the second one I have purchased over the years. They just WORK! Plug them in, connect the Ethernet cable and you are on the network. I'm using this one to stream video to my TV downstairs. Yes, I'm not going to lie - streaming HD can be problematic. You might see some stuttering, you might not. We have 5 machines on our home network at various times during the day. If the network is clear (maybe one other machine on Internet), usually HD is no problem. If not (downloading torrents, streaming music off the Internet, etc.), you might see some stuttering. Overall, I'm very pleased with this product. Very good quality - solidly built."
5,Runs Flawlessly with anything,"I want to tell you how great this hub works. I just recently moved into a bigger house and needed connectivity throughout. I called Actiontec before buying this to learn more about the product. I hooked it up downstairs and attached my PS2 to it.I got the Actionec Megaplug twin pack as well. PS2 recognized it right away. I don't have any issues with playing mutliplayer. In fact the computer I am typing from right now is connected to this 4 port hub. It has no issues with my Actionec Router.It works well with any of my systems (Win98,2X,XP & Linux & OSX). I do notice that the speed is not as fast as my other systems connected directly through the main router. But it is nothing to complain about. What's nice is that my other electronics are nearby and can connect to the net using it as well. So, this hub is very handy. I just absolutely like it! I am glad there is a great alternative to trying to run cables throughout your house.I have no regrets.SteveK"
5,I'm up to 9 MegaPlug devices at home and couldn't be happier,"I've been a big fan of these products for a while now, and continue to find the need to keep adding more. It started out with just a pair of single port adapters to connect my DirecTV DVR (which works flawlessly), than it was connecting PCs for my three kids. Now I've added a network printer (in a central location) that the kids can share. I've recently connected my Slingbox, and several IP video cameras for remote surveillance.I've been pleasantly surprised at the network performance. Even as I add more devices, the throughput remains strong (which is a big deal for Video on Demand), and it never goes down.Connecting these units is as simple as plugging in a lamp. I for one am very happy not to be dealing with wireless configuration on multiple devices."
4,"Works Great, Needs wall outlet","Used for a AT&T MCell, BluRay, Wii, and Tivo for internet connection and works great. Except it needs to be plugged into a wall outlet and cannot be used with a surge suppressor of any type. Had to run separate extension cord and keep it dedicated since you don't want anything else getting unprotected power."
5,Finally! A Diet That Makes Sense,"Finally, a diet that makes sense and helps you manage what you eat without retooling your lifestyle. I feel like The Greenwich Diet was designed for me a woman on the go who loves to eat. I cannot believe that with having six meals a day I can lose weight. With only being on the diet for 2 weeks I can already tell that I am losing weight and feeling great. Thanks Dr. Colker!"
1,A Real Turkey,"Nothing new here. Although the author tries to dress up the diet, it's basically just a rehash of all the other no-carb diets out there. The concepts outlined are contrary to what has been established as nutritional science.What's most disturbing, however, is the incessant hyping of Twinlab supplements. As others have pointed out, the book reads like one big advertisement for Twinlab.If you're interested in a much more objective approach, check out ""The Ketogenic Diet"" by Lyle McDonald."
3,Great Book--Too many Advertisements,The quality of the information presented in this book is very good. It ranks among the top Low-Carb Diet books I've read--and I've read a lot. The only problem with this book is the countless advertisements for one of the publisher's supplements. Sometimes the book seems more like a marketing tool rather than an source of information. This is the only thing preventing the book from being rated higher.
1,One BIG advertisment,"This book lulls you into feeling you're reading an informative diet book, but all the sudden it turns into an advertisement for Twin Labs. If your looking for an objective diet book don't buy this one."
4,kira vs watt....,kira returns with her first album in quite a while with her now ex husband mike watt creating a bass opera.so with there 3rd album together picking up where they left of on there last new alliance realise uno con dos .she is quite a good singer i dont see why she dont get a full band together.i will have to say they are still great together playing kind of a bass ping pong game of conversation but never really running out of any thing to say. there are also a couple of tracks that mike used on his firehose album that makes me remember that she was a co song writer on some of there songs as well.so with mike watts longest running band since the minutemen and kiras only band since black flag this is definatly some old school stuff.just to basses and a lot of things to say not pretenious but lots of fun. so if you like this and want to hear a great interview with the dos of them go to mike watts hootpage and cheak out his pedro show.its a good conversation also....
2,Died in less then 5 years,This WAS a great TV. Awesome picture and didn't have any problems until about 6 months ago. Started to have either the bottom half or the top half cut in and out. With some research I knew I would have to replace the Y boards soon. Not a huge deal right? Well just the other week the whole thing died. No video at all. I took it down from the stand and what do I see? Without even opening the back cover I can see everything is melted inside. Disappointing to say the least considering how much was spent on this TV less than 5 years ago.It will cost less to get a new Plasma then to fix this one.
5,Excellent value for a great TV,"I purchased this 50-inch Samsung from Amazon at around $1700 and am completely satisfied. Debated between this and the comparable Panasonic, and to be honest, I chose this black model over Panasonic's silver. Sharp, deep colors were very important to me along with wide viewing angles. This TV delivers! The lack of 1080p was a slight drawback, but I personally didn't see the value in having it. Probably only downside is that the sound put out by this unit's internal speakers is somewhat weak. But if you're buying an HD TV, you darn sure better be connecting to an audio receiver! The non-HD channels look better on this unit than other similar TVs I've seen and it naturally stretches those channels to fit the screen. The TV is one month old as of this writing, and I couldn't be more satisfied. Very good value for this TV."
1,One major problem,"This TV looks great and the picture quality is good. However, its electronic circuit boards are so noisy that you can hear the noise from across the room while the TV's volume is on. Amazon just sent Eagle Trucking to pick it up today. I believe that it is a design problem and I will order another brand."
5,Great Product,"I have reviewed many HD TVs from different sources. Samsung 50 inch was the best size (for future moving), best quality (screen and function, remote) at the best price. It was a good deal. Amazon offered the best service."
4,Good Product But,"Great product ,I am enjoying it very much...But Amazons shipping needs to change a few things, There shipping time is very miss leading .They said it was going to be shipped by ""expedite shipping"" then they send me an e mail saying "" Eagle does not offer expedited shipping"" right after I ordered it. I ordered this November 27, 2006 on the promise it would be here in 3 to 5 business days. The estimated time they send me after I ordered was December 20, 2006 that's like 17 business days...I had to fight with them on the phone to get it here when they promised ,so be prepared to either wait or give the run around on the phone."
2,Had to go through 2 of these before giving up,"Bought this TV, got it home, BUZZZZZZ....TV repair said it was the cable, cable company said it was the TV. Took the TV back, got a second one, did the same thing. Changed cable companies, rewired the house, same thing. Returned it and got Panasonic, no problems. The buzzing noise only happened through the ypbr connection to HD cable. Did not have problem on regular digital cable nor on HDMI cable."
2,RETURNED,"TV had loud buzzing, right out of the box. Called Amazon, while delivery guy was there, and returned it. Requested refund and bought Samsung 46"" LCD. Buzzing is a well known issue with this model."
2,"Defective, right out of the box",I turned it on right after the delivery guy unpacked it. Loud buzzing noise comes from the back when I switch the power on. Amazon directed me to call Samsung first. I called them and they proceeded to tell me that the noise was normal but i would not take any of that. I had them send out a repair person who dismantled the television and told me that I will be getting a replacement unit. He said that the unit is irrepairable because defect is in the way the plasma panel is bound to the aluminum backframe trapping tiny air pockets that cause the noise. He told me that Samsung will contact me to arrange for a replacement. The replacement unit came and it was buzzing even louder. I am contacting Amazon to take it back. Not worth all the time I took off work to deal with this problem.Too bad. I was really looking forward to owning this TV. It looks sleek and the picture is very crisp.
2,Be aware of the BUZZ problem,"Have read all the reviews on avs forum and amazon about the buzz problem on this set, I still decided that I was gonna take the odds. It has been 3 months since the problem was first reported and I thought Samsung should have come aware of it and fixed the problem.Well, SO I THOUGHT. There is NO luck on my part! The set buzzes out of the box. You can hear the buzz sound over 10 ft away when there is no dialog or you put the TV on mute. The set was manufatured Nov in Mexico so even the latest ones have this problem! Mine is on its way back."
2,Don't buy large TV from Amazon,"Received HP-S5053 TV yesterday, turned on last night. A very loud buzzing noise came out from the back of TV, I can hear from every corner in the house. The character on the screen seems vibrate with the noise. I called Amazon, ""No return or exchange, call Samsung"". I guess Amazon lower its price to attract buyer and at the same time getting a lower cost from Samsung by shipping a defect TV to buyer. What a business practice from Amazon. *&#*"
4,Great tv for the price,"There are a couple other brands that are a little better than the samsung, however, with a price tag of a little over 2K (uncluding shipping) this was a great deal. Thanks AMAZON."
1,Not satisfied,"I purchased version HP-S5033 from Sam's club. It looked like a nice TV with sleek design and the necssary PC connections that I was looking for.I connected the power and the cable. The images were really nice. We thought we did the right choice. My family watched the TV for less than 2 hours... And then we heard a ""click"" sound after which the screen turned into something worse than the dual passive laptop displays of 10 years ago. For those of you who don't know what they are, you really have to get closer to the screen to be able to see. We called Samsung and they weren't sure what happened. They told us that if someone does not contact in the next 5 days, we should give them another call. This is obviously not acceptable: I am buying a brand new TV which cost thousands of dollars and yet I will be was told to wait for some repair service within a week. I had to return the TV to Sam's club the next day. This is the end of the story. Draw your own conclusions. Good luck.Haldun Unalmis"
2,buzzz,i bought this tv well aware of the buzzing problem people have been talking about. but thought i would be one of the lucky ones. well i wasn't it buzzed from the first time i turned it on. one thing i did notice is the buzzing is do to the echo coming off the back cover. if you loosin or tightin the screws on the back of the tv the buzzing sound reduces. but who wants to buy a tv for this much money and then work on it.so after about a week of buzzzzzz sent it back and ordered the samsung 46 inch lcd 1080p. no more buzzz i guess you get what you pay for. i can't beleive a company as big as samsung would allow it's products to leave the plant like this.
5,Awesome purchase,"This is a great buy, great price, excellent television, great picture!!! We will soon move this Television to our 2nd home in Mexico and purchase a larger screen but same brand for our existing home. Amazon was great to purchase from, their shipping was awesome and the Television you cannot beat for the price!"
3,Problems on day one,"Buying the TV was easy. However, shipping was horrible. The TV sat in the SF warehouse for 4 days until I called EAGLE. Even with Amazon Prime, it took over 2 weeks. They finally made arrangement to deliver it today. Once unpacked, the unit looked nice. The problem was the loud buzzing noise from the back (upper right, most likely power supply). It was so loud everyone in the family noticed it- essentially making it useless. I have asked for a refund from Amazon and also called Samsung to find out if there is an easy fix. This particular unit was mfg 9/2006 in Mexico."
1,Poor quality,I have had so many problems with these calculators. It's nice that you can actually change out the batteries on these (some calculators you cannot) but these often stop working and changing the batteries won't help. They aren't all that expensive but they aren't even worth the cost. I'll be slowly switching my classroom set over to calculators of a better quality.
2,okay book...,"this book was okay...i would suggest:(5/5 stars *****)Stadium Stories: New York Jets (Stadium Stories Series) (Paperback)by Randy Langeor(4/5 stars ****)GANG GREEN : AN IRREVERENT LOOK BEHIND THE SCENES AT THIRTY-EIGHT (WELL, THIRTY-SEVEN) SEASONS OF NEW YORK JETS FOOTBALL FUTILITY (Hardcover)those two are much better."
2,WAY TOO HEAVY!,I love stretchy gemstone bracelets but this one is way too heavy and bulky. The price was very reasonable but I honestly will never be wearing it. So rather than waste it I decorated a pillar candle with it. It looks much better on the candle than on the wrist.
4,Happy Mom,"MY daughter is 1 and plays with this toy sometimes. Keeps her busy for 20 minutes. She enjoys pushing it around face up and tries to put other things in the holes besides the balls. She never uses the hammer to hit the balls. She simply hits them with her hand and uses the hammer on other things. The music is nice, but gets annoying after a bit. Does have an off switch!! Thank goodness! This is a very durable toy as she has pushed it into the wall and its survived great! The balls for the fisher price ride on/walker with the basket in the front can be used with this toy also!! Great since we own them both! More balls to play with!"
4,Very exciting,"I bought this toy for my 6month old daughter and she loves it. The music, the lights, the hammer and the balls. Very infant friendly. The bad thing is that she loves to put EVERYTHING in her mouth, including the whole toy itself, how funny."
3,Fun but hard hammer,My 7 months old son loves it. I showed him once how to use the hammer and he does it but prefers to use his hands to push them through. He chews the hammer. The hammer is too hard. He has hit himself in the head a couple of times & it hurt; I know because he hit me! He doesn't know yet how to put the balls back in the holes. He usually hits all the balls down then takes the entire toy and chews on it!
4,"Small, sit-down Ball Blaster","We have the Stand-Up Ball Blast too and our daughter likes that better. This one is still good because not all babies can stand yet, it is less expensive, and the baby can put the balls back in without having to sit and stand, in theory. I have yet to see my 9mo old put the balls in the holes after she knocks them in with her hands. She does chew on the hammer though. I am hoping that she will grow into the toy and use the hammer to knock the balls in the holes and then replace them....we'll see. She does have fun with the toy, probably because she makes me do all of the work. It is also portable so you can take it to Grandma's. The toy has some educational value because babies do need to learn to pick up objects and place them in specific places. Also handling that hammer is a skill...think of how many times you have hit your thumb."
4,aunt of twins,I got this toy for my twin nephews who are 8 months old and they LOVE this toy. Whenever they pound the balls they get a light and sound reward. This toy keeps them busy for hours. You get a lot for the money. This toy is a must have.
3,Sit & Pound Arcade,"I bought this toy for my son when he was six months old. He still enjoys playing with it for a few minutes, but it doesn't keep his interest for long. Also, he hasn't figured out just how to use the hammer to hit the balls, he just uses his hands or another ball. :) He also tries to stand up holding onto it, and it isn't very sturdy."
4,Caution,"Just a caution about this toy. My daughter loved this toy when it was given to us. She was obsessed with continuing to push the ball through the hole with her hand. She got up on her knees and by putting her hands on it, it fell over and she bloodied her mouth when she fell on it. She is 11 months old. It was just a freak thing, but now i sit right there with her when she plays with it. Very neat to watch her learn cause and effect. I still recommend this toy."
4,Fun toy!!!!,"My son is eight months old & has been enjoying this toy for some time now. He loves to push the balls through the holes & loves the sounds & music it makes. I am not thrilled with the plastic hammer, as he can bop himself in the head. Great toy though, worth getting!"
4,Helps baby practice sitting,"I bought this toy to help my 5 1/2 month old practice sitting up. I didn't think she would have as much fun with the toy as she did. The hammer didn't serve much purpose except to put in her mouth, but she liked to pound the balls with her hands. Only a few days later and she can sit up without toppling over."
1,disappointing,Our son received this as a present for his 1st birthday. It looked really cute but he quickly lost interest in it. Using the hammer proved to be difficult as did trying to get the balls out of the holes. All the lights and music became boring after a while too.
2,just another toy,There is nothing exceptional about this toy. My baby is 5 mos. old and isn't thrilled w/it. It's supposed to teach cause and effect. It just makes alot of noise and sends the balls rolling.
3,Not much for a 6 month old,My son recieved this when he was 6 months. He loves the lights and of course he likes to suck on the hammer and the balls. The biggest problem is he likes to pick everything up and he tries to pick this thing up and topples right on top of it. The toy is fine if I am sitting with and playing with. I hope the toy will offer more enjoyment as he gets older.
3,buy something else,"I have 2 babies, ages 19 months and 7 months, and neither of them really liked this toy. The balls got lost the first week or two we had it, the one thing they both love is the hammer. My two boys would rather just drag around the hammer than really play with the toy. When they try to hit the balls it would/will topple over too easily and it's simpler to hit the big red button to make the noises play than to try to push the balls through (after finding them first!) If you're looking for a good, durable toy that will get lots of use, this isn't it."
3,"Fun, but there is another stand up one that is better","My son got this toy for his first birthday along with a big stand up one which you put the balls in the top and then the balls go down a slide that circles to the bottom where he squats downs and picks them up again. He thinks that the big one is great the little one (above) doesn't get played with to much however. The bigger toy is great because every time he puts a ball in it plays music for about 20 seconds and my son loves to dance to it. Don't waste you money on this one, go to the store and get the one that is almost the same, but they can stand up and put the balls in their self."
5,Hours of enjoyment,"I bought this toy for my 6 month old daughter-now she is almost a year old. She loves it! In the beginning, she could only push the balls into the holes but now she uses the hammer. She has had many countless hours of enjoyment from this toy. Also, she likes to hear the music sounds and see the all the lights. I like the two choice volume control. It is a chanllenge to get the balls out and put them back in. Overall, she had really enjoyed the sit and pound arcade."
4,Toy Review,"We picked this toy for our 6 month old son because he loves to pound and bang. Right now,he uses the hammer to bang the floor but loves to push the balls through the holes and watch the lights. The toy pushes over easily and he can't get the balls out of the base so we play with this together. We've had this toy for several weeks and he still get excited when he sees it. I think this is a good toy he will enjoy as he grows and develops new skills."
2,Bleh . . .,"This toy is cute but has never held my son's attention, not when he received it at 6 months old or now that he's 20 months old. There are better toys out there."
2,BOOOOOORING,"This toy is not only hazaderous, but it is a hunk of junk. The balls always end up in the mouth-although they might not be able to be swallowed-they do get stuck in their mouths. The hammer gets lost to easily. It is rather annoying and the kids loose interest in it too quickly for the price. Not recommended-make better use of your money."
1,baby playzone,"My 1 year old daughter was not thrilled with this toy. You put the balls in the hole and hit it with the hammer,it plays music and has lights. She was bored with this quickly. She would rather just throw the balls around."
1,playzone,My daghter got this when she was 9 months old. She will not play with it. It requires good hand-eye coordination to hit the balls with the hammer. The musical noises it makes are loud and they scare her. Would not recommend this for any child under the age of 18 months.
2,Set does not have enough bang for the buck.,"Blades do not stay very sharp very long, & there was only one of each type in the case. The handle was comfortable, ergonomic and easy to use. Blade changes are simple and the blade was held securely. The handle was well engineered and sturdy, my problem was with the blades they were not even hardened. I only wish that the attachments were as good as the handle. It would also be nice if extra blades (more than one of each) were included for this price."
2,"Not ""Milwaukee"" enough","The handle accepts all of the blades and the handle is very good and what one would expect from Milwaukee. Top grade and solid. The blades are not. The kit would be a good buy at $30. As is and priced at $45-$50; you are buying the flexibility and general usefulness of an ""all-in-one"" product.If it wasn't Milwaukee branded, it's OK. With the Milwaukee brand I am disappointed.UPDATE: Ryobi owns Milwaukee now; that could be part of the issue."
3,Product is Okay,"I don't think this was worth the money. It is Milwaukee quality, which is great, but once the blades are dull, I will probably never replace them, due to the cost. This was an impulse buy and every time I need a utility knife I don't reach for this kit, I reach for my $1.98 utility blade."
2,"interesting, but not realistic for most people","I enjoyed the author's enthusiasm for the idea of painting from the source, which I understand to be a form of spontaneous painting without a preconcieved notion. However, it is difficult for the average person without an art studio to follow the instructions for the large scale work that the author intends is good for the soul. I am sure the author's workshops that are mentioned quite frequently throughout the book are stimulating and are wonderful environments in which to do this work. But I found myself wishing I purchased a book with more practical strategies for how one can engage in painting for one's soul.Also, there are color prints in the center of this book; I frankly found them frightening and not particularly inspirational. Art is not only about the ugly and less aesthetic, it is about tapping the beauty of the soul as well and bringing that forth through paint or whatever medium one chooses."
3,Okay...,"After having read many novels from this genre, I just wasn't that impressed. There are many pros and cons to this story...Pros: It did keep my attention, and I found the imagery between Jessica and Lorri as polar opposites interesting. It also exposes cutting as a real issue.Cons: The blatant drug usage didn't really appeal to me. What I like about this genre is the actual realness of characters and I found the idea of this everyday usage being normal a bit out there. There wasn't very much development of the Skye/Lorri relationship and I thought the mother was just a bit too extreme.So, in the end, it's nothing compared to the greats of this genre--Annie on my Mind, Empress of the World, etc., but it's not terrible either. Just not great for realists..."
1,Couldn't Even Finish it.,"I started this book with high hopes. I thought it was going to be a compelling, romantic story. What I got was a whole bunch of information on masturbation. I have no problems reading about sex in a book, as long as it doesn't get too graphic. This was not graphic, it was disgusting. Every chapter, or so it seems, had at least one moment where Skye or Riley was masturbating.I couldn't get into because I was so disgusted. I stopped reading around chapter 8 and returned the book."
3,Decent,"Comma splices are my pet peeve, and this book is full of them. I don't really think the writing in this book was that great, but it held my interest until the very end. A lot of the stuff was unbelievable. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you have a lot of free time and have already read all the good books out there."
4,somewhere between volleyballs and candelabras,"Smart, witty, true-to-life (in the southern California sense, at least) tale of a girl dealing with life as she finishes high school. More than a few interesting items on her plate--a mentally unstable mother, an emotionally unavailable father, new friendships, and her own struggles to find and understand love with the girls she is drawn to. I like that this isn't your overt 'gay' novel, as it stands on its own as a very believable account of what any young adult could experience in today's hormonal adolescence. A bit self-absorbed, but weren't we all?"
5,Nambe` Products,I have found the Nambe` items to be of top quality. I give their itemsas gifts and they are always happily received. I have many of the piecesand enjoy using them. I highly recommend Nambe` products.
4,All about Silvio Berlusconi - A mistery of these years,"This book is difficult to find. One says that the copies of the first edition have been made to disappear. Many collectors are searching for this book, desperately. The price (as rare used) could be very high. The book is written good. It speaks about the political rise of the Italian leader Silvio Berlusconi, his transactions (presumed) with the Mafia and on his mysterious holdings. The first edition (1987 by Editori Riuniti in Rome) is unavailable. The second edition (1994 by Kaos in Milan) can be found with high difficulty."
4,TRADITIONAL YET EASILY UNDERSTOOD,"Nine classic fairy tales are retold in this luminous volume glowing with full page illustrations and punctuated with spot art.Young readers will find Sleeping Beauty dozing blissfully beneath a bower of roses, and smile at a fetching Goldilocks sampling porridge.Most importantly, these stories are recounted in a manner that observes the traditional, yet appeals to young ears with contemporary language."
1,No instructions,"purchased 3 packs of two test and they arrived with no instructions. Per the Amazon description it said to dip test into urine and results in 5 mins. Well what exactly is a dip? I tried dip, then dipping a new one for 3 seconds, then another new one dipping for 5 seconds and finally submerging a new test. All test came back invalid so i wasted 36bucks. It would be very helpful to have some instructions on how to use."
1,Did not work.,"Did not work. They were expired and I wasn't offered any replacements, very dissapointed as I was looking forward to trying them."
1,Gives a different result as the single test strips,"I bought both the multiple test strip and the single test strips and the multiple showed a negative result for THC and the single test strip showed positive from the same urin, and I failed my test so the single was right and the multi was wrong!"
1,A concerned parent,"I haven't tried this test, but I was researching it because it was so inexpensive. I found a forum where kids who are using drugs share information, and the Devon products were mentioned. A teenage boy had purchased them to figure out how much pot he could smoke and still pass the urine tests his parents were requiring. From what he said, he kept increasing the amount and continued to pass the test, which made him wonder if it was faulty and giving him a false sense of security. He had his friend (who according to him smokes ""5 times as much pot"" as he does) also take the test - and the friend passed as well.As a parent who was about to purchase one of these tests I found it very interesting. I will spend the extra money for the peace of mind."
1,Just a marketing tool,"This book was difficult to read in my opinion because it inched along in Wealthy Barber fashion. Some people like that, but I don't. You had to read about detailed mall conversations with fictitious people for a page before you get to the part about budgeting. Ultimately, the book does not address what to do with the complex issues of envelope budgeting such as a single Walmart purchase of clothing, food, toys, and cleaning supplies. Do you haul out four envelopes and make change? How do you carry large amounts of cash safely? All the ""how to's"" conclude with a suggestion to do the envelopes with software, i.e., the disk included with the book. This is nothing more than a software sales pitch, and it gets worse.In order to use your 30 day trial of the disk included in the book, you must ante up your credit card number and agree to pay the a monthly fee if you forget to cancel. You cannot access the software without signing up for this service. I got taken. You don't have to."
1,Mvelopes is a rip-off machine,"This is another shill front for mvelopes, a web based scheme for gathering credit card info. An offer of a free trial is phoney. You may only resign by their own convoluted trap system. Your payments are non-refundable, their policy. Check epinions, rip-off report, and BBB.Inevitably following this post will be several glowing stories of the succes this system brought them, for only $99.00 per year."
1,A reader:,"Money for life relies on a online software program that will cost you a few thousand of dollars over a lifetime of use. If you need a reason to buy a computer this is it. If not, and you need a tool to keep conscious of your spending and wealth building habits. Then I would recommend the budget kit by Judy Lawrence. Good Luck!"
2,don't be fooled,"The book and workbook are helpful, but don't be fooled into purchasing the online version. Customer Service is horrible. You will have the opportunity to try a 30-day ""free"" trial but not without inputing your credit card #. The program walks you through step by step on setting up your account however it makes it nearly impossible to cancel your subscription. And forget speaking with live customer service, everything is done through live chat and e-mail. And you certainly won't recieve any notification that your ""free"" subscription is coming to an end. This program will cancel your enrollment but not without charging you your initial subscription fee. Mvelopes intentionally traps you into using their online budget system because they recognize that anyone with the book and pen and paper can budget their finances more efficiently than their online service."
5,Fantastic!,"My 11 month old daughter LOVES this DVD. Every morning she actually points at the tv until I start the DVD. She gets so excited and she is glued to the screen the whole time. I even enjoy watching it. She has already picked up several signs in the last week from this, including ""mommy"" and ""daddy."" I definitely recommend this product!"
4,ARMORMARK,este producto es de calidad primeras es muy bueno tengo este producto para mi vehículo se lo aconsejo que es bueno
4,Girls Football shirt,This shirt is very pretty and different. The one flaw is it runs extremely small so you need to buy at least 2 sizes bigger.
4,"Everest, Mountain without Mercy","This book is a companion to the Imax film of the 1996 Everest climb, made famous by the tragedy detailed in the Jon Krakauer book, Into Thin Air. This book is up to the usual standards of its publisher, the National Geographic Society. It contains spectacular photographs, and a narrative that contains both detailed technical information for the mountaineering junkie, and a gripping story."
3,Primer on Buddhist/Sherpa culture,"After reading ""Into Thin Air,"" I've been searching out any book or magazine article about the obsession of reaching the top of Everest. After hearing David Breashears on NPR, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. Maybe I expected too much. The photography is stunning, and I appreciated the technical info about the logistics of filming at high altitudes. What I did not like was the extreme detail Coburn went into every time anyone waved a juniper branch. Fully 1/3 of the way into the book I was still reading details of every Buddhist god of every rock on the trek. I realize this faith is extremely important to the Sherpas (and also the author) but my enthusiasm for the prayers and rituals did not match Coburn's need to illuminate me."
5,Completely Fascinating!,"This book is for anyone who has an interest in Mt. Everest. The photographs are magnificent. They show just how small mankind is. Our hopes, dreams and accomplishments are put in perspective. I loved it!"
5,"A ""Must"" for your Everest Collection","If you have a collection of books about Everest or mountain adventures in general, this book is a necessary addition. Being on the mountain at the same time of the disastrous 1996 climbs of Rob Hall's and Scott Fischer's expeditions adds extra interest to the book, and gives the reader still another perspective on that episode. But more valuable, the photographs (both related to the disaster, as well as of Everest and the surrounding countryside) give the reader a much better handle on what it looks like up there. They bring home, much more vividly, some of the risks and dangers that climbers undertake when they start that climb. A great book to read, and a great one to give as a gift for those you know who enjoy adventures or adventure reading such as this."
3,This is where old aluminum cans go,"In all fairness, you get what you pay for. This would be a good faucet that only needed to look nice. The moment I first touched it I was sure it was plastic with a thin metal veneer. I had to know so I took it apart. To my surprise it was made of metal. I did not know it was possible to make such a thin metal faucet. You are better off just using plastic.It looks good, really! But it is a very poorly made faucet that was a disappointment to me. My next faucet is going to be an old one off of ebay. Solid brass I will just have re plated and rebuilt. In this recession, all but the most expensive faucets are very poorly made."
4,standard product,"I've had it for about 1.5 years now in my utility room. Works well. No leaks yet. Water output is...not quiet or smooth like a good quality faucet. But as long as it functions well and doesn't leak as a utility faucet, I guess I'm happy. So I'm not pleasantly surprised nor am I disappointed. Compared to the factory supplied faucet that came with my sink, this one's working well so far."
4,Classic Fun Game was a Hit at Family Reunion,"This classic game was enjoyed by the kids at our family reunion; however, I had to constantly re-stick the tails and remember where each participant stuck their numbered tail because the tails did not remain stuck on the board. Perhaps next time I'll also use double-sided tape or push pins on the tails because despite the tails not sticking, the kids (ages 3-11) really enjoyed themselves so this game will be used over and over again."
1,Very poor quality,"This could have been lots of fun, but the quality is very poor and the ""tails"" did not stick to the donkey for more than a few minutes. This caused the game to have no meaning -- no competition! So it was all pointless.I would truly pay more for a more useable and durable edition of this very old game.It has the potential to be fun, but not with the quality of the material."
2,So-So,"I was looking for a low carb ""crunch"" and decided to try these. I found them just so-so. I got a few different flavors and I found them all a little bland. I won't be purchasing these again."
2,Cost too much for too little,"The crackers are pretty good, if you an stomach the price. Great for low carb diet. You get about 15 crackers in a box. At $5.99 plus shipping, save your money for the gym."
2,Too simplistic,"I've bought this book for my laminate floor project. The book turned out to be a disappointment: it gives no more information than I found on a leaflet from a laminate crate. With great details and pictures it explains very basic things, like it targeted for a 6-years old doing his school science project. But it omits really important details and nuances: how to calculate a layout so you wouldn't end up with the 1-inch wide last row, where to use which molding and how to install it, and so on. And if some unexperienced and not technically-inclined person starts his project using only this book, he very quickly may find himself in the troubles, with lot of materials and time wasted."
3,Helpful,"I'm a novice DIYer and new homeowner of an old place, and I like to get all the help I can before talking to experts. This helped me get informed on some flooring options, and was certainly helpful with illustrating to my carpenter what I wanted in different areas of my current renovation project. I probably would rate it higher if I've had the chance to do the work myself, but that's for later."
4,George Gently,This series has engaging scripts. The acting in this series is excellent and entertaining with a good mix of serious and silly. It is not a formula police show and there is a minimum of gore with interesting forensics that do not overwhelm the narritive with lab proceedures.
5,Bravo,"The latest two installments in this first-class detective series are simply superb. Indeed, ""Goodbye China"" is as good as anything ever done in this genre. I say this with decades of viewing under my belt. The writing is superior, the acting is mind-boggling, and the photography--in and around Durham--could hardly be improved. For both films, the directors deserve special honors.It's encouraging to learn that a collapsing Western culture can still produce television on the level of the best of Frost, Morse, Lewis, Foyle, and (our own) Nero Wolfe. Don't miss the opportunity to see these two films. May there be many more such productions in this series."
1,repeats,I love the george gently series but i believe these two episodes from series 4 are repeats.Im pretty sure these were in series one or two.
2,"Great program, LOUSY PURCHASE!","This review is about the purchase, NOT the program. It's MY fault for not paying attention to the fact that this season is only TWO EPISODES! Most of the short British programs are at least four episodes. But to pay $35 for just two episodes is robbery.Man alive, do I regret wasting my money on this! It'll be available from Netflix within a few weeks, no doubt. Buyer beware certainly applies to this purchase. I'll be extremely wary of purchasing video content here. It's a terrible value.Again, fantastic series... LOUSY price!"
1,Nowhere near as good as her other books.,"Dara Joy is usually great and I'll read as many futuristic romances as she'll write. They are so much fun, and so well done!! But this book was a serious disappointment. The sex was pretty good, but as far as I'm concerned, the only reason to read this book. If you have limited time to read, choose one of her other books--you'll truely enjoy THEM!"
3,OK but not her best,"I read Mine to Take just before I read this book; I don't think Tonight or Never is nearly as good. The romance was OK. It had some cute moments but almost all the romance seemed to consist of was sex, and this sex did nothing for me. I found myself skipping ahead to get back to the story. But chacun a son gout (also the name of the estate in the book). There are some very funny scenes and I liked the Scarlet Pimpernal subplot. But where Mine to Take set me on fire, this one was for me just an amusing read."
3,Not one of her best,If you like the hot love scenes that she is famous for then you will like this. I was disappointed in the story itself. There was a more interested story with a minor character named Percy then I felt with the main characters.
2,Not even close,The story was ok but it could have been better. Ms Joy I imploy you to explore Sexton's charactor more. Personally I would have like to hear more about his past and his relationship with Chloe. Also what had she been doing in the colonies all by her lonesome. I mean no disrespect by this Ms. Joy but you should stick to sci-fi romans with powerful and exotic men. So far my favorit books that you have writen are Rejar & Mine to Take. PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME HANGING AND GET TRAED A GIRL. Maybe a femmilar hint! hint! PS tell us Krue's story! Cause we want to know!
5,I love clever women!,"The woman in this is clever! The love scenes are sensuous! The guy is oblivious, as men occasionally are :) It was fun to read. It reminded me a bit of Georgette Heyer's style, but a GREAT DEAL sexier. Lot's of laughter, lot's of plot twisting, Regency style, with a steamy relationship thrown in. Luckily, without an insipid female to have to deal with in the bargain."
2,Her Other Books Are Better,"Although Dara Joy is at the top of my list for favorite authors, her work was a real disappointment in this book. There were too many characters and subplots which---to me at least--- distracted from the main plot and focus of the hero and heroine. It was a cute idea, and I got a real belly-laugh over the one bedroom scene where the hero gets a black eye, but with Dara's incredible imagination I know she could have done better. Maybe it was the deadline...who knows?"
1,Light-hearted with no real substance,"This is the first Dara Joy book I've read but I hope her other books are better. There are some funny/cute moments but the characters, especially the heroine and hero, could've been much more developed. Chloe is refreshingly free of annoying traits that some heroines of romances display but John is too one-dimensional. The relationship between them is also seriously lacking in tension. I would've given the book a higher rating if the whole Scarlet Pimpernel subplot had been left out; it added nothing to the story and took up space which could've been used to develop the main characters' story."
3,Decent story but don't pay new book price!!,"This is a reissue. Look for it at used book stores before paying a new book price. It's a good story although when it first came out I was sure it had been written hastily to fulfill a contract obligation. Very different from Dara Joy's other books, which I enjoyed more than this one. A quick, easy read."
1,Poor packaging for a fragile mirror!,"I received the product and upon opening it, I cut myself with a broken glass. The beveled edge is broken and there was only TWO pieces of rectangular bubble wrapping in it knowing this is a fragile item! To make matter worse, in order to get a credit, you have to return the item back and the glasses will continue to hurt someone along the way who touches the box! This is not worth buying online due to the headache of dealing with breakage issues."
1,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap!","Product came broken. The metal corners are spot welded (if you can even call it ""spot welded""). With little movement, the entire railing system just fell apart and is impossible to fix unless you start gluing stuff.Don't buy this. You get what you pay for."
4,Vanity Tray,Very nice product for the price. Looks just like the pictures and my daughter loves it for displaying all her perfumes. Would recommend.
3,Tray,I bought this for my dresser and it looks nice it's kind of hard to clean though. I would recommend it.
4,good,the item was what i ordered. But better care should have been taken in the Packaging to insure that the item arrived in proper condition. If the item cannot be shipped in a way that will insure that it is not damaged than it should not be sold online
5,Great!,"I had been searching for the ideal tray for our wide bathroom sink counter for quite some time. When I saw this one I realized my search had ended. And when I received it, I wasn't disappointed. It's sleek, it's contemporary and most of all it looks great on the counter. I have several cut glass containers on it making the entire look sparkling and clean. The glass dowels add to the sparkle and shine plus they prevent any containers from falling off it. One thought for anyone looking for an item such as this. Make sure the width is appropriate for your needs. My mistake -- a few extra inches would have allowed several more items within our every day reach. That being said, I love this one anyway. It will be sufficient for my needs."
4,Add a little dress-up to bathrooms!,The two Dressing Room Trays that I have added a very positivefeeling to both Dressing Rooms where I used same.Very happy with them.
3,The death rattle,I received this beautiful piece like so many others with a broken side rail. I knew I was in trouble when I picked up the box and heard a rattle. The one end rod and side rail had come apart. I am going to try and glue it rather than go thru the trouble of sending it back.The packaging is horrible. The box was put inside a bigger box with no packaging materiel so it just slid all over in there. Why dont they do something about this? I was going to order a different mirror from this company but not now.
3,"Nice mirror, but...","This was a very nice mirror, fit on the top of my toilet tank perfectly. Shipment packaging was very good, but one of the plastic bars was still shattered. I chose to use it without shipping it back."
4,lovely garnet & moonstone earrings,these are very lovely earrings and the size is perfect. they coordinate nicely with a garnet and moonstone necklace that i have. they will also be lovely on their own.
3,MAN-E-FACES,"I was excited about this toy because I had one in my childhood. But this was not like that one. This imposter can not stand straight up, it falls quite a bit due to its stance. It can't hold its weapon because of its flimsy fingers. It is not as sturdy as the original toy. What a disappointment."
2,I was hoping for more than 30 minutes heat retention,Nice looking and well constucted BUT I need heat retention of three to six hours of hot coffee. I should have read the warning label that warned of a hot exterior when filled with hot liquids (a sure sign of heat loss).
2,Where's my thing?,"I placed an order on Amazon for a 5012 KaBar Fighting Knife in OD Green from Reds Gear with standard three to five business day shipping. I already have two other Marine Combat models (both purchased through Amazon) that I like, the classic USMC KaBar and the Ontario 498 in black leather, and I was excited to get something without any leather that I could feel comfortable using out on the river (even though it's still 1095 carbon steel, it's better than something with a handle and sheath that will absorb water like a sponge and then deteriorate quickly).The delivery date was anywhere between July 26 and July 29. It is now the first of August and I have no contact from the seller or from amazon regarding where my package is or what happened to it. I am not very pleased with this company's ability to honor a commitment so far.Keep an eye out for a review if I ever receive my product."
5,"Solid Feel, Looks Well-Made","Has a solid feel and seems to be very well made. The blade is sharp and the knife a little on the heavy side, which to me indicates quality and solidness. The sheath that comes with it looks good too. It has a plastic top holder that just bends to keep the knife in. Have not used it yet, but looks good to go."
3,Episodes missing!,"Ok, I give this a 3 becaues I love Friends...I have all 10 seasons, so no reason to buy this and also no bias.Read the episodes that are on it....if you're familiar with all the episodes, you'll notice that 2 babies are missing...Monica and Chandler's twins!!!!! It's not ALL the babies if they don't include the finale!I agree with some other reviews I've seen. You're better off buying all the seasons individually. That way you get the bonus features also...the gag reels are pretty funny."
1,stick to the complete season sets and save money,"ok,last time,this is friends the one with all the babies=0this is friends complete seasons sets=5any questions?"
4,Little Thoughts - Big Ideas,"This is another compilation of songs (6 songs & 1 video for the title track)from previously UK only releases, made for Japan. The title track and 'Helicopter' can both be found on the album 'Silent Alarm'.'Tulips' is moody and groovy with swirling guitars and a catchy drum beat. A great mid tempo love song with sincere vocals. This EP also contains a remix of this song as well.'Storm & Stress' is a good upbeat pop song with catchy, angular guitar work that is somewhat of a trademark of this band.'Skeleton' another good song that fits right in with the 'Silent Alarm' era material. Fast drum beats, dreamy and angular guitars, driving bass, and rapid-fire vocals.For the amount of material here, this is kinda pricey but it is an import which are always more expensive. There are three very solid b-sides here: Storm and Stress, Skeleton, and Tulips. To get these songs by buying the singles they appear on may end up being more expensive than just buying this one EP."
4,Understanding Boolean Algebra,I find that this book explains both the principles and mindset of relationships and objects very well. My intent in purchasing this book was to gain a fundamental understanding of these principles as a foundation for relational database design. I believe my efforts to build a database and construct queries will be rewarded with the better grasp of the Boolean building blocks.
1,Terrible Product,"I'm disappointed with this product. The text is very small(tiny!) and the production is choppy. The lessons are short and vague. The lessons show a keyboard and a very faint red mark highlighting the appropriate keys during the poorly executed songs(the first song sounded like a short Gregorian chant-not exactly appealing to children). Not very educational, appealing or entertaining for children(or adults)."
1,Awful graphics resolution,"The graphics resolution is awful. It is blurry and fuzzy even the big fonts. Very difficult to read the lyrics of the songs included in the pentagrams. I tried couple of monitors and changing resolution to the minimum, Still not able to see lyrics properly. Also, it is difficult to figure out what the notes are (confusion between contiguous notes, in the middle of the pentagram, like F and G, etc).Theory is OK, I guess.At the end of the day I think I am the only one to blame for buying such a cheap product, I am just getting the quality I deserve for not doing a proper research."
4,Miracles Still Happen,"Father Alfred Boeddeker, O.F.M., was almost 50 when he took on the greatest undertaking of his life. Named pastor of St. Boniface Catholic Church in San Francisco's Tenderloin District, he went beyond ministering only to the local residents, downtown business people and shoppers. Fr. Alfred extended his ministry ""to care passionately for the poor, the sick. the homeless, the hungry, the unloved, the forgotten."" He did this as founder of the St. Anthony Dining Room. Madeline Hartmann writes knowingly of the man, his formative years, his family, his education, and the charisms that nurtured his success. In this era, when role models and heroes are scarce, this biography of a modern day miracle worker was truly an inspiration. I highly recommend it, especially for young people, who may doubt that one individual can make a difference."
4,The Man Who Made a Difference.,"This story about Father Alfred gives a new insight to the fact that one man can make a difference. A difference to so many people, in so many places. The story gives a wonderful overview of his life and his dedication to the poor and needy of San Francisco and many other places in the world.The author developed the story through a number of interviews of people that worked with Father Alfred and from personal recollections and family history. In this way, the story gives very real glimpses of how Father Alfred accomplished the feeding of millions, provided health care for the poor and needy, and how he helped others to begin similar programs.It would be a good reading assignment for students in civics classes. It is easy reading with many short chapters dealing with specific interviews or events and happenings. Overall, it shows the real Man Behind the Miracle."
4,Wunder?,"Das Buch liest sich gut - auch von einem, der nur Schul-Englisch kann. Wer interessiert ist, etwas über deutsche Einwan derer in die USA zu erfahren, bekommt darin eine Menge Informationen, nicht nur Histörchen geboten. Father Alfred, Nachfahre westfälischer Bauern mit langer Tradition, hat auch in der neuen Heimat seiner Familie selbst in Ordenstracht das Zupacken nicht verlernt. Madeline Hartmanns Buch hält ihn in Erinnerung, so wie er tatsächlich war."
1,A waste of time and money,"I found absolutely no value whatsoever in this book. It's another ""take a deep breath and dial the phone"" books that lacks any specific advice to work with. A complete disappointment."
1,Not happy,"Disappointed by the appearance, the bottle itself look old, with the label on the bottom being scratched off and it also didn't come with a box, the perfume had a old strange smell. I was not happy about any of it and it costing $60.00 on top of everything else."
4,Detailed read about a troubled singer,"This was a ""I cannot put it down"" book. Ronnie Spector, even though married to a millionaire was ""locked up"" but her perserverance got her through this ordeal and she found the love of her life and is now a happily married, with two children wife/mother.Great story about the Rockin Ronettes!"
3,interesting,"Ronnie Spector is more interesting when she was young and a Ronnette as opposed to when she got older. The first half of the book was fascinating, especially from the music history point of view. Once she seperated from Phil Spector, it was not that interesting.Since the book was updated, I would have liked to hear a lot more about the homicide at Phil Spector's house as well as how Joey Ramone's relationship impacted/influenced her.If you are a fan of Ronnie Spector than this is an enjoyable read."
2,rough on he hair,It's not gentle on the hair. I made a mistake and added the conditionner with the solvent - if I hadn't I would have no hair left.
2,Tolerable if you are coming from a strong OO background,"Poorly written. Terrible examples. Many times the text refers to example code that isn't actually presented. I have a strong C++ background, so I was able to survive enough to understand the differences between C++ and C#, but I can't imagine reading this book with just a C or other non-OO background. How about this for an opening sentance to a chapter: ""A programming model based on unrelated classes proves cumbersome when an application begins to be filled with class types that represent is-a-kind-of instances of another class type."" This is the type of confusion you can expect. I can barely parse this sentance and I have taught many college courses on OO programming and design."
5,Best Book of It's Kind. Period.,"Mr. Lippman brings to C# what he brought to C++; that is, an easy to follow, concise, tutorial for a complex subject. The book is indispensable for beginners and advanced people who enjoy a tutorial introduction to new topics. The book is meant to whet your appetite for the broad range of subjects possible in the .NET framework (remoting, soap, web services, xml, etc...), but remains focused on teaching you the C# language. Excellent book. Well written."
2,"An adequate Introduction, but nothing more","It is a perfectly adequate introduction to the langauge and nothing else. The discussion of delegates is confusing -- the online docs were better.The book answers how-to use language features, but not why to use them. It does nothing to discuss any of the pitfalls of the constructs in the langauge, like the dangers surrounding implict conversions and operator overloading. Finally he doesn't discuss the Debug, Trace and Attribute classes in any useful detail."
3,Major disappointment,"I had high hopes for this book, given that it was written by an experienced author and published by DevelopMentor. If you're expecting something up to the usual DevelopMentor standards (see books by Don Box, Tim Ewald, Keith Brown, etc.), however, you will be sadly disappointed.The book reads like a first draft, full of errors, repetition, typos, and garbled prose. The author belabors the easy stuff and glosses over the nitty gritty. Some of the examples don't even compile.A slap dash effort, not completely worthless, but you can do better -- e.g., see A Programmer's Introduction to C# (Second Edition), by Eric Gunnerson."
5,Great book to learn C# for experienced developer,"Most C# books are so verbose that after a while you tend to skim over parts just to finish the book, this book however is shorter and to the point, so you have a chance of actually finishing it. This book focuses on those C# issues that are new/hard for people that are relatively new to object-oriented programming, like classes, inhertance, interfaces and not much on topics familiar to any experienced developer like conditional logic, looping logic and branching. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn C# and object oriented programming."
1,Not what is pictured.,The item in the picture is not what I received. The adapter does NOT fit a powerbook g4. DO NOT BUY!
5,"AC Adapter Charger A1021 for Apple, iBook G4, PowerBook G4, 12"" 15"" 17"" 14"" (24.5V, 2.65A, 65W)",This is a spare. Haven't needed it. But since the other one like it is OK I assume it will be if ever needed. John
5,Perfect Lowcost alternative to Apple made product.,Works really great! No negative issues. Just make sure you have the exact older model laptop that fits this adapter.
4,worth the price,the first one last about a year...i recently order my second one i think is worth what i paid.......totally will buy the third one in the future!!
4,pretty good for the price,"This is an o.k. Back-up charger to have. I wouldn't use it as my main one, it gets very hot, but it does its job"
1,Doesn't work,The piece of crap didn't work! This is a waste of money and didn't charge up my laptop once. I wouldn't tell anyone to buy it as it seems only about half of these things work.
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I purchased this product in lieu of the more expensive Apple adapter. It worked fine for a couple weeks (though I was a little concerned when I felt the adapter while charging & it was very hot), but then stopped working altogether. I tried it in different outlets throughout my house, but came to the conclusion that the adapter itself was definitely a lemon. I was tempted to purchase another one, thinking that the one I purchased must have just been defective, but upon reading more reviews of the same product from several different sellers, I'm convinced not to waste my money again. The exact same thing happened to nearly everyone whose reviews I read. Apparently the company producing these chargers is making them all shotty...I guess they're cheap for a reason! Don't waste your money!"
2,Don't buy this item. Spend more money on one that will last.,"This is the second generic mac adapter I've bought, not wanting to spend $80 on one from Apple. This one, like the other, died after only 3 months of use. It's not worth the money, both for the lack of life of the item and also for the hassle it causes when you're stuck without laptop power and can't access anything until a new one arrives. I buy lots of things generic, but in this case, I'd spend the money on something that's not a piece of junk."
2,Way too short,"This is the 2nd one of these generic chargers that I have ordered. The first one broke after about 5 months, so I bought this one to replace it. A warning to anyone buying this charger... It is extremely short, and the build quality sucks. I have to jiggle the connection to get it to work from time to time."
2,dead after 4 months,major issues1) the connector that attaches to the power block is VERY loose. you barely tug on it and it separates2) 4months later it no longer worksnow looking to get another replacement. would NOT recommend.
1,Did not work for more then a hour,When I first unwrapped it and plug it up to my Mac it charged it. Then I turned my laptop on it worked fine for about a hour then it needed be charged again. So I went to plug it up and it never charged again.
1,Don't waste your money!,"This product was totally worthless! It stopped working after a few days of use. It is very inexpensive indeed, very cheap in quality. Bottom line: Don't waste your money and time."
1,Defective product,"The power supply was defective, worked for 5 days and fried a chip on the motherboard (melted totally)- still waiting for a response I would not buy anything from this company. Lesson learned - never buy after market electronics made in china!"
1,NOT 65 WATT only 45W,As a few others said it is only 45W. Not rated high enough for what they have listed. I need a 65W charged like the description said. Its only 45W. If you want to check this out yourself on an Apple laptop click the top left apple and click about this apple. Then click more info. Scroll down and read what it says for power. If you have this charger it will read 45 watts NOT 65 Watt.Save your money. Your paying for a 65W and getting a 45W that is not enough watts to charge correctly. Your battery will not last as long and when the battery is almost dead you have to wait for the battery to take some charge. So what this means is you CAN NOT use the laptop for about 5-10 min if the battery is dead. Even if its plugged in and charging. I guess the low watt charger cannot handle charging AND running the laptop.I am sending it back!!!! Can I leave zero stars?
4,its ok,"i ordered this when my sister's friend needed a new adapter for her apple powerbook. when we got it, at first we thought it couldnt fit but after some pushing and a little bit of forcing, it went in and worked like a charm."
4,Works,"If you are like me, your Apple charger shorted on you and you don't want to spend $100 just for an Apple replacement. Luckily, this generic worked for me perfectly and did not overheat as much as the Apple one. Go for it."
2,Better for paper plates or bowls,"Had to return this item, as it was too wide to hold standard 12-cup basket filters (as shown in photo). Tried fanning out the filters as manufacturer recommends but they still fell out. The ad and box show coffee filters being used, but product itself is embossed with ""Pop A Plate"". 6"" paper plates or bowls would probably work much better in this."
5,Making Life Easy,This thing is great easy to put up and works making life easy to make a pot of coffee when your half a sleep.
1,Basic,"This is a basic book that may be good for new people in the market, but professionals will find this lacking."
5,Excellent book for new recruits,"Because it covers most of the financial instruments that we are dealing on our trading floor, we have decided to offer it as a gift to all new recruits.It is always difficult for new comers to quickly become knowledgeable about many financial instruments at the same time.""Capital Market Instruments: Analysis and Valuation"" provides all the necessary information to help them become real practitionners within a short time frame.I would personnaly recommand this book."
1,Poor coverage,"This is a very introductory book for practitioners who do not know the very basics, such as 'models', 'regression', etc.The content overlaps with the author's other text Bond Market Securities. Corresponding chapters are identical.Better alternatives are Jarrow, Hull."
2,Very bad book as a simple introduction,It seems to me that I bought a CD not a book. The book could be throw it away. I?ll keep the CD. My rate is 2 stars.
4,GREAT CHILDREN'S BOOK,"I READ THIS BOOK IN ELEM. SCHOOL AND IT CAPTURED MY IMAGINATION. THIS IS A WONDERFUL CHRISTMAS PRESENT BECAUSE IT KEEPS THE YOUNG READER INTERESTED IN THE ADVENTURE FROM PAGE ONE. I AM 23 NOW, AND I JUST BOUGHT A USED COPY OF IT TO RE-READ AND HOLD ONTO UNTIL I HAVE CHILDREN ONE DAY!"
3,CHRISTMAS EVE ODYSSEY,"On Christmas Eve young Becca discovers tiny people climbing on her tree, trying to carry off her favorite ornament--a glass mermaid. She agrees to shrink to their size and join them in their quest to save the mermaid of Seatown. They all disappear down a hidden door in the tree trunk. Becca, Sander and Jingle race against time to rescue both mermaids from the evil schemes of the Captain--a sorceress who terrorizes Seatown.Becca has always been jealous of her older, graceful sister, but on this magic night she discovers that she has value and talents in her own right--she needs to be brave and strong to help her miniature friends. When her task is accomplished, she realizes that she truly belongs in her real family after all; she is NOT second best or a failure. A light read which elementary girls will enjoy. (Could introduce a class discussion of sibling rivalry and how we view ourselves.)"
3,not bad But..............,"Not bad but, I think all the arms slinging around was more than to much of that. Beautful costumes.It didn't feel like some of the dancers really listened to the music.Nothing really stands out to say about this dvd or dancers."
3,"dry, but informative","As an undergraduate, I used this book during my first animal physiology course. I found the book to be very dry and uninteresting. The material in the book was easy to read, perhaps too basic. I felt that at times there were gaps in the explanations."
3,Hard to assemble,This pole is not easy to assemble or install. Plan on having at least 2 STRONG men handy when putting the sections together & adding the pole to the sleeve in the ground. Once the pole is up - it looks nice.
3,Great for school!,"Beware before you purchase this item. The CNN Cold War series is one of the best around but original copies are so difficult to find that many being sold today are pirated versions. I use my VHS tapes all of the time but when they arrived, it was clear that they were not originals."
4,Catch that Reggae Hip-Hop Tyger,"The first cut on this album of alternative dance music is a sort of rap-reggae version of Blake's ""Tiger, Tiger"" by Jah Wobble. It's not my favorite cut on the album, but the rhythm is infectious, somewhat slow and a good dance tune, indeed. I was more interested in this album for the cut by Brian Eno ""Blissed"" which departs from Eno's usually slowly-evolving form-from-formlessness. It's a dance tune! And this from Mr. Music-For-Airports. Roger Eno's ambient tunes are almost like folk-rock, quite subtle and wonderful--a bit like Simon and Garfunkle in a strange sort of way.This album is fun--lots of different stuff. If you like trance, ambient or just something a little off-beat, this is extremely enjoyable."
1,TERRIBLE!,"These pads are thin & tear apart easily. They are completely useless. Buy a name brand. Better yet, go to the Dollar Store. That's what I should have done in the first place. You will get a better product there.Ignore the first reviewer - it's a fake product review and I should have trusted my gut. Amazon really needs to do something about these cheezy third-party sellers & suppliers, their utterly craptastic products, and all their scams & fake reviews. I, for one, am getting a little tired of it. Geez. Some people. Pathetic way to make a buck.DO NOT BUY! Seller = Mid-States Beauty Supply."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"They fall apart in your hand before you even use them. I couldn't even use one.Too thin, wispy, and useless."
1,DULL,Dull. How they made a boring documentary on this amazing story is truly sad. Don't bother. This was a gpdrag
4,Baseball doc,My husband loved the movie and it was pretty entertaining for me (a pseudo-baseball fan). Really honest and great for baseball diehards.
5,A Great Baseball Movie,"For a movie that didn't make it into mass release, this was an excellent film. It captured the quirkiness of the pitch and of the pitchers. The pathos were touching and real. A great movie for baseball and non-baseball fans alike!"
4,More than a baseball movie,Great human interest story in addition to a story about a weird baseball pitch. I thought Dickey's story was more interesting and this movie would have a much better ending if it came out after this season. Fun to watch once.
5,Very interesting even for non-sports wives,"I'm not a sports person, but I do love the fact that people love games. Such innocence! Such fascination! (See Fr. Schall for how watching a game is a foretaste of the fascination of Heaven). There is a lot more to sports than sports, if you catch my drift. And the whole tale of knuckleball, what it is, how it has lifted players up and cast them down, is worth a look. Your husband will probably love it. But non-sports oriented wives too!"
5,Great baseball story,I enjoyed it as I'm a Sox fan and love Wake but it's an overall great baseball story of how RA Dickey and Wake made it to the majors on a knuckleball which is considered a gimmick.
3,808 State - Invader,"808 State have never been the ones to really sit on their laurels; so with their Invader single, they go full-on aggressive, with some rough breaks laid under an acidic line -- a rhythm-oriented track, definitely. ""Full Nelson"" has more keyboard work, as well as a vocal sample that sounds like a tribal call-to-arms. The Vegas Soul remix of ""Invader"" takes the track into a techno setting that fast and tech-inflected. A striking single, to be sure."
3,"easy to understand, hard to read","I could only manage half of the book - it is easy to understand, has many good examples and a lot of informative content. But, probably due to it being a translation, it is not very easy to read, especially compared with one of O'Reilly books on the same subject. Also, I expected more on the business side of modelling, and less on IT system side (that was the reason I picked this book out of many similar ones that covered the IT side in detail)."
5,Very Experienced Authors,"This book explains Business Analysis as well as IT System Analysis & Design using UML as a tool, rather than explaining the use of UML diagrams for one of the two separate design efforts. This gives you complete three dimensional picture of business process and IT system.The authors have carefully separated the ""Airport Check-in"" business process from tightly integerated business processes like boarding, luggage handling, etc. This gives you the idea to define your limits and isolate a business case from complex real life situations.The book does not cover complete UML grammer. The authors intended to introduce the diagrams used in most business situations. I think it is sufficient for ninety percent of the cases."
2,Sets up like concrete,My son loves his ninja turtle but the goo is awful. If the goo gets in your carpet it will not come out. I shampooed it vaccumed it and even tried cutting it out and no hope is left for the carpet.
2,I expected more,"This DVD is OK but definitely not a must have. If you like LOG, fine. If you're semi-fan, don't even go there and buy it. Cheap production overall, not worth the money. Sure, there are 2 DVDs so you may perceive it to be a good deal but the second DVD is the one you already own if you bought Sacrament Spc. Ed.Listening to them bitching about touring conditions gets annoying after a while. Well it's metal you're playing, if you want thefancy hotels with superb logistics at concerts, convert to orchestra."
5,Keepin' it Perfect!!!,All in all just an awesome DVD. A gret follow-up to Killadelphia. You won't be disappointed!!
3,Yep..Its Lamb of God...,"Its pretty much what you would expect from the all-american band that kicked your aszz on the first dvd. Its a must for any true LOG fan, but i have a few complaints about it. The live set-list is great, but for the awesome amount of songs LOG does well, you get 8 or so here, repeated over 2 discs. I love the documentary process and seeing the behind the scenes of the band, but i also want to see the live experences of the new cd and such. The set list isnt listed on the outside of the case, and once i bought it and opened it, i realized the same songs are repeated live on each disc...eh...somewhat of a let down for someone that is looking for a 5.1 live dvd representation of what LOG is truely about...METAL."
3,"Incomplete, disappointing as far as Unofficial Guides go","No discussion of pre-theater dining! When you are going to see Wicked at the Ford Theater, there is not much more you care about than where to eat first. In fact, the restaurant guide does not even mention half the restaurants that are listed online as ""the"" pre-theater dining places (none of which ""grabbed"" me online, so I was hoping this book would be more enlightening).Also no full drawing of the various parts of the city. Small maps that show only two districts do not tell me where Bucktown is relative to The Loop. This is critical when all the hotels, restaurants, etc. are referred to by district.Overall disappointing, because The Unofficial Guides tend to be better than other guides, and they tend to be better than this."
2,Ouch! Watch this one with little fingers!,"Conceptually, this toy pretty cool...music is fresh, colors are vivid, etc., but in practice I don't believe this toy to be appropriate for the ""9 months +"" age recommendation. I find that my one year olds cannot press hard enough on the blue goo (of which there is not enough) to actually draw a picture....but most especially, they get their little fingers run over by the rolling bar that you have to swipe over the screen to ""reset"" the drawing area. Whether they are playing together or separately, someone always ends up crying due to fingers getting caught under the bar. It's just not worth it. Better for older children in my opinion."
1,Useless and Extremely Annoying Toy,"I thought my one and half year old would love this toy since she loves to doodle. I thought the texture and the colors of the toy would interest her. We've had the toy for over a year now and although she goes over to pick it up once in a while she has not played with it for more than 5 seconds. I have two other children, 5 and 7 and they've done the same. It may look interesting but it really does nothing. Anything you write or draw on the toy is immediately erased because liquid inside the toy keeps moving. You can't even make a simple circle. In addition, the toy keeps playing music with the lightest touch. My husband has indicated that he would toss the toy away if it makes one more sound. I've hang on to it hoping I wasn't wrong in purchasing this toy. But as I am writing this review, the toy is going to the trash."
3,Good Idea That Doesn't Deliver,"While the concept of no mess music and art combined is great, the practical use of it isn't. You have to press very hard to get the music sounds to work--my 10 month old can't do it at all and my 3 year gets frustrated since it's so inconsistent. SO, while we like the idea and think it could be educational and entertaining, it just doesn't deliver the goods."
3,Mom with small children,"My son (2 years) loved it for about 10 min. at a time,it didn't keep him interested for long. My concern is that sometimes his fingers would get pinched under the roller when he tried to erase his drawings."
2,Disappointed....,"My daughter received the Musical Fingerpaint for her first birthday...five months later, I'm dusting it off to sell. The only thing she liked to do with this toy is put the shapes in and out of their holders. (...)The Musical Fingerpaint is a great concept, just poorly designed."
1,1 start,"Very hard for a child to use. You have to push the pieces down hard on the ""music"" board and little fingers just can't do that. It is a useless toy."
2,Better for Toddlers,"I got this for my 10mt old son last Christmas. It has been almost a year and he's played with it for a couple of seconds maybe 5 times. He has a 3 1/2yr old friend that comes over and he enjoys it a lot more. The younger children just haven't seemed to understand it enough for it to have been a worthwhile buy. I feel like I bought for older kids (even 5&6yrs) to play with when they come over. However, it is VERY durable. It has been thrown, kicked and trampled on over and over again and the stand on the back hasn't even broken off yet."
5,Excellent Toy!!!,"I bought musical fingerpaint for my then one-year-old son. He loved it from the start! It is very easy to draw and make music with just the hand or fingers. I never removed the shapes, so my son did not use them -- and he still had lots of fun! He had fun painting by himself and also with me and his older sister. It's a great toy to enjoy WITH your child! My son is now 2 years old and he still plays with his musical fingerpaint. He still likes to make the rainbows with his fingers, but now he also likes to make dots by hitting his finger on the screen.The only thing I don't like about this toy is the stand. With a sturdy toy, you should include a sturdy stand. This one seems a little weak as a support for when someone is pressing down on the screen. However, the stand is optional, and the toy works well lying flat on the floor. In all, an excellent toy!!"
2,Disappointed,"I was really excited about this toy thinking it would be great for my son (12 months at the time) to use his fingers to make designs. But, I was disappointed when we got it out of the box. The stand is not sturdy enough to hold it up while drawing or erasing. It also comes off easily, so my son would pop it off and walk away with it since the stand was more fun to him than the drawing part. The different shapes that come with it are practically useless. You have to push so hard on them, and even then it doesn't make the whole shape. Also, the ""fingerpaint"" material inside it doesn't smooth our very evenly when you ""erase"" it - even if you use two hands and even pressure. Overall, it was a waste of money."
2,Watch Babies fingers,"The toy is entertaining, but please watch your babies fingers. I finally threw it away because everytime my daughter rolled the bar down, she would smash her finger. The toy is also not very age appropriate for a 9 month old. My daughter is nearly a year old, and is just starting to really get into this toy."
3,Disappointed,"Santa brought this toy for Christmas and my 1 year old played with it for a little while. Then, when we trasnported it home, the plastic ripped. Now the blue ""Paint"" leaks out. I think I enjoyed it more than she did while it lasted."
2,Not the greatest!,"My son got this for a present when he was one and never showed any real interest. He is 2 now and is going in the ""re-sell"" bin as he still walks right past it."
2,Expecting too much,"This toy doesn't work well. You are supposed to be able to clear the drawings by running a bar over it, but that does not work. I think the manufactor should reconsider the age on this product as well. It is geared to children who are 9 months. A 9 month old doesn't know what drawing is or has the motor skills to operate the toy. All my son ever did with this toy is stand on it to make the music play."
1,Wouldn't recommend,"Too much pressure is required to ""finger paint"". The only way for the paint to hold a design is to use the attachments - it you use your fingers the design disappears right away. The roller ball that is supposed to erase the design in too hard for a little one to maneuver, and it required several strokes back and forth before the paint is smooth again. I bought this on-line because I loved the concept, but wish I had see it and tried it in the store first."
