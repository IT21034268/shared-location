3,Always a pleasure but...,"I've always liked the Stokes books and CDs. Their love for birds is apparent in all their material. The photographs are rich and lively, and the books are simple yet elegant and informative.However, if you're interested in building birdhouses, this book will fall short. There's only one plan for the simplest house you can imagine, and anyone who would appreciate the book's other charms probably won't think highly of such a simple birdhouse. There are some interesting houses pictured, but little about how to build them..."
1,Quite possibly the worst birdhouse book ever.,"Wow. This book was so incredibly bad, it's hard to imagine. I've read a number of books on building bird houses, and I've built dozens of them myself. I bought this book based on the Stokes name and reputation. Bad move. There is only ONE plan. It's the standard ""single board bird house"" design. And they require you to use two boards!!!Let me say it again. This book only includes ONE plan. The rest of the book is fluff. It tells you what birds like bird houses. It tells you other types of houses that you can make (if you go out and buy a real book), and it tells you a little about the birds. All things that are much better explained in other books.Do yourself a favour. Don't buy this book. Or, since you can always return it, buy t and see how pathetic it is for yourself. What a disappointment."
3,A somewhat biased veiwpoint,"Owen writes as you would expect a tweed-coated cambridge prof to write. While definitely worth a look, his assumptions which must be deduced, are questionable. A bit of an attitude toward the Catholic Church is obvious, especially the Papacy (he is an Anglican, perhaps?), and he seems a little too amicable toward socialism to take all his work as evenhanded.As well, other reviews on this page are right to mention that he seems to not quite make his point. Perhaps having 30 years hindsight gives todays reader a more critical view. The book is well written, but is he right?"
3,Thanks to Gaston found Dubay's Collecting Hand Painted Limog,Gaston recommends Debby Dubay's trilogy: Collecting Hand Painted Limoges Porcelain Boxes to Vases and Antique Limoges at Home. She wrote the intro for Collecting Hand Painted Limoges Porcelain and the foreword for Antique Limoges at Home. She calls Dubay's shop a porcelain's paradise - and she was right. Thank you Ms Gaston for supporting author Debby Dubay!
2,Poor Quality Collectors Book.,"It is obvious the author is brillant, but this book is not very interesting and the overall quality is poor. If you compare this book -- it does not meet the grade. I can not recommend."
2,Do not recommend,I purchase books online based on the reviews so lets be honest. Debby DuBay's book Antique Limoges at Home is the book to purchase. Gaston's book has terrible photographs & just can not compare to DuBay's books.
5,THE Encyclopedia!,Mary Frank Gaston is the leading expert! This book is a must for the library. I found Limoges Antiques Shop through this book. Highly recommend DuBay's book LIVING WITH LIMOGES to complement Gaston's encyclopedia -- then Limoges collectors have it all!!
4,Great resource book,"I appaulad Gaston for collaborating with so many collectors. Gaston wrote the foreword for Dubay's book ANTIQUE LIMOGES AT HOME and I thank her for inspiring such a wonderful new author. Gaston is the expert, but the photography in this book is poor."
4,Good gift book,"Content is typical MacArthur: excellent! I was disappointed in the size of the book...fairly small, however, it still is an excellent read for every Christian home. Will make an excellent gift to every family. I will definitely buy more for friends and young families."
5,One sweet picture,I've had this set for about 3 weeks and am still amazed at the picture quality. The color and contrast is very sharp. Menus are easy to navigate and there are lots of settings. Has multiple inputs including 2 HDMI inputs. Channel changes are quick and the sound quality is pleasant.If I had anything negative to say it would be that there is a slight flicker when switching from a 1080i HD program to regular programming (which I understand is normal) and there is a slight curvature to the screen that you notice at first but soon adjust to it. When comparing to other sets in this price range I think this is by far the best I've seen.If you plan on using the HDAVI ez-sync feature with a Panasonic DVD recorder you better plan on purchasing the Panasonic brand HDMI cables. I found out the hard way that off the shelf HDMI cables don't support the ez-sync feature. Part numbers ar RP-CDHG30 and RP-CDHG50.
5,Fender Bracket,"Fender bracket fit perfectly on my bike. Has different slots on the end so that you can adjust the height off the tire if need be. Also has holes in the heel end so that it can be screwed to the fender. Comes with screws and bolts, but I switched them out for ones with lock washers. Fit perfectly on my beach cruiser with 26"" Schwalbe Fat Frank Balloon tires."
5,Very information for good guys.,Everyone should read this book. It provides a lot of ways of doing things differenly to make life better.REally enjoyed this book.
2,BORING,"This is a decent read, but it is painstakingly boring. I fell asleep countless times with this book. It is a good premise to write about, but the author did a terrible job b/c the book is drab and uneventful."
2,Not for Everyone,"Although this book is well written and seems to have helped many based on the reviews... be aware the books suggestions rely on the same stuff that I think tends to make ""nice guys""... Finding sponsors, staying ""safe"", relying more on others etc.This is not a book on being more masculine nor does it cover what makes a male a real man."
4,Great book,This is a great book for those who seek to find a source of internal struggles. It has answered many questions and set me on a positive path forward.
4,"Good Book, a bit repetitive","Great book with some interesting perspective on breaking the Nice Guy, people pleasing role. A bit repetitive in parts with his favorite sayings, but overall a useful resource and a relatively easy read."
2,Not impressed,Basic pop psychology that wasn't impressive. I did like his emphasis on being honest and accepting yourself but in the wrong hands this book would validate all the excuses men who are physicall abusive use for being psychologically abusive.
5,A must book for most of the men,"What can i say about this book. This book is really amazing. From start till the end, it makes you so focused with its reality and wisdom in it, that you cant put it down.There are many different examples of nice guys and im sure you will find a similar to you - which all of them share some common characteristics described in the book.There are many paradigms and exercises to do that really make you realize a lot about your past - and then there are some solutions you can do to prevent those things.It is very well written and i can say that is probably the best book on psychology (about men - nice guys) that i have ever read.Do a present to yourself and buy this book. Its amazing."
5,"A Must Have for Every ""Nice Guy"", wimp, etc.","This is an excellent book! It is a rude awakening for every ""Nice Guy"" or man struggling with confusion over being a man. It forces one to be brutally honest about the reasons, motivations and habits for being nice, as well as facing the realities of life itself. It also brings one to make a choice to accept responsibility for your own life and take action in the work of being complete and fulfilled as a man. The information in this book is truly a revival for the soul of ""Nice Guys"". I highly recommend this book. 10 STARS!!!"
3,"Content: OK, conversion to Kindle: sloppy",While I am beginning to enjoy the contents of the book. The conversion to kindle was terrible. Chapter Titles are the same (or smaller) text size then the normal text. There are missing spaces between words every so often (actually this seems to be common).More on the content later as I advance on the book
3,Repeat over and over again,Basically the same thing over and over again. I think there are about 3 points in this book which are just repeated throughout. Didn't really help me much because these were all things most people know. Interesting examples though.
5,Life changing,"I purchased this book a few years back. At the time, I wanted to blame everyone else for my shortcomings. Recently I have read to book twice. Every man should have this book. This book is only good if you approach it with an open mind. Meaning if you are in denial about being a nice guy, this book or any other book wont help you. After years of being a nice guy and being disappointed, I am enjoying life alot more."
5,I thought I was the only one :),"This product is the best product to treat the nice guy syndrome. Now, I understand why I was not happy even though I have a beautiful girlfriend. I was a nice guy. I was needy and wimpy. This is an awesome product, highly recommended."
5,All nice guys...get this book...now!,"I've read the digital MS Reader version. For us self-proclaimed ""nice guys"" it is Wonderful advice! The author really helps us see what's at the root of our niceness, and more importantly, how to overcome it.I can hardly wait for the new hard cover to come out. It will make it much easier to mark up and take with me wherever I go."
2,For Co-Dependent,Lot of this stuff is rehash from any codependent type of Book...The Advise is just O.k...If you are looking to re-create yourself...try the 48 Laws of Power or the Bible...Good Luck!
1,"Nice Guy, Nice Guy, Nice Guy, Nice Guy, Good grief","This book advocates taking responsibility for meeting your own needs by expressing honestly what it is you want. But Glover uses the gimmick of the ""Nice Guy"" label to excess. It became so distracting to read over and over that ""Nice Guys tend to....."" that I couldn't finish the book."
5,Only 10 pages,"I read only 10 pages of this book and realized that it was about me (100%). I will order this book right now !What to say -it's me !So, what is solution to this situation - well, I will tell you:1. Never give a woman a single chance to use your intentions to make feel everybody good. When I was in trouble a number of my male friend and people I knew did almost impossible things to help me (not a single woman did even smallest thing for me).2. You do not own her anything, simply, just get rid of her - are there any normal woman in the world ? well, I can not remember that I met any recently.3. Do not get her pregnant - a beautiful child is great blackmail -something she was waitning for so long,4. Fortunately, I was clever enough not to include her in my financial dealings. Also, I let her know, ""that by accident"", I have some useful ""contacts"" (if you know what I mean).For now this is enough,XX"
2,long and boring....,long and boring.... Hold on to your NUTS is the best relationship book out there.
5,Stop Being the PUTZ you KNOW YOU ARE!,I just read this book once through and half tried some things like the PUTZ I am and my wife is amazed. She is asking me about what has gotten into me. She is definitely happier with a man who is stepping into his role and so am I. I am realizing that I don't need permission to be a man. I already am one and others need me to be one. Enough of the mushy crap...now stand up and be known. Brace yourself for happiness and sex.
4,Good condition and received Quickly.,"Book is solid, Not great, but it has some good points in it. Just don't expect everything to pertain to you."
3,"A good book, but filled with fluff","I bought this book as part of my quest to improve myself. The beginning chapters talk about the qualities of ""Nice Guys"" , which a lot of the described qualities that I posses. It offers good advise dealing with how to overcome these qualities, and shift one's ways of thinking. However, this book also is filled with too many examples, to the point where it becomes difficult to read. I understand that examples are necessary, but the author could have stood to reduce those."
4,If you've been told you are too nice this is definitely a good read!,"If anyone has ever told you that you are too nice, then you need to read this book. You can apply it at work, at home, in relationships, etc. Was recommended by therapist. Highly recommend."
5,"Excellent book, wish the writing was better.","I was really pleasantly surprised by this book, I originally bought it as a joke for my friend's birthday, who happens to be the stereotypical nice guy. Out of curiosity I started reading it, and was drawn into the the author's discussion on the ailments of the modern man.I would highly recommend it to any most guys looking to become more fulfilled with their lives, and to their partners as well.However, although I gave the book five stars, the writing leaves a lot to be desired. After thirty pages in the book becomes repetitive, and had it not been out of piqued curiosity, and finding some things that related to my life I probably would have set it down unfinished after 30-40 pages."
4,Very accurate so far,"I've only read the first two chapters so far and I'm going over the third one now. But his explanations of why nice guys are nice, why they are treated the way they are, and what this causes in them has been pretty accurate so far. I can't wait to finish reading the book."
4,Great read!!,I enjoyed reading the book. There was a lot of useful information to apply. The book gave me additional insights to examine and for my son to put into use.
5,Life Changing book,"Life changing and fantastic book!! Read the summary and if you have any of the tendencies then buy it,read & apply it. there are great excercises and i highly recommend going through it. joe"
5,Finally I am becoming happy,"If you're a nice guy, or think you're a ""nice guy"", this book will horrify you as you turn every page... It will expose you. It will make you feel uncomfortable. But it will also empower you and help you become the person you want to be.I learned so much about myself. After a few weeks of reading and practicing what is in the book my life has changed in a very positive way.Read this book."
3,It's OK,"There's too much talk of the theory of how nice guys came to be. There's some good advice, but I didn't expect the book to be so gentle in giving it."
4,"Good, but rather heavy on the ""Pop"" Psychology","Good book. Stretched out with large type and lots of whitespace to make a real book out of it.The advice is excellent and very beneficial.A few criticisms: the book reads like everyone with this good guy syndrome has all the characteristics. Yet many sufferers of this will have many but not all the behaviors listed. This is not discussed anywhere in the book. Also his take on pornography reads like anyone who touches it is a deviant. The reality is many people simply enjoy it in moderation. When it dominates your life it IS a problem, but not according to the author. At least that is how it reads."
3,Miswired harness,Overall I have no problems with the build quality of the item. And from what I hear it is generally in working order. I do have a head unit with 4V preamp outputs so this generally worked good with my Nissan/Bose system.BUT I had a problem where the harness was wired incorrectly. The yellow wire (12V always on) was in the wrong location on the harness! It was a very painful process to figure this out. Luckily it wasn't in a location that damaged my head unit. But just beware that this has happened at least once.
2,nissan wire harness,"easy hook up, but design flawed. connection no problem, but no power to rear speakers.bought differnt harness, works great. kenwood receiver was used.could not send back harness, since it was connected and disconnected."
1,Does not sound as good as my Bose system on my '05 G35,"So I connected this on my '05 Infiniti G35 and I sounds nothing Like my Old BOSE Stereo. I really wanted to get a Nav on my car, so I bought a Pioneer and I didnt get the sound I expected. I am going to return this and get the PAC ROEM NIS2. Ive heard many good things about that kit so i will exchange and i will update this once I install to see if there is a difference.UPDATE: 12/22/10DO NOT BUY THIS. If you want some serious BOSE sound, buy the PAC ROEM NIS2. Trust me. Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyy better. It makes the BOSE system sound better than factory."
2,Popping Sound /w 4v Preamp HU+Bose,I have 4v preamp outputs with Bose and I have a popping sound when changing tracks or radio stations. A ground loop isolator is said to be required to resolve popping issue. If using the Bose amps/speakers you will need one isolator for the front set and one isolator for the rear set. I gave this product two stars because it requires additional parts to work properly with my Nissan/Bose system.
2,Poor for Infinity Bose system,"While a nice simple idea, the harness does not give a strong enough signal to the Bose amp from a Clarion deck w/ 2V preamp outputs. Volume is very limited with this setup. Some would say to bypass the amp with new wiring from the deck, but in Infinity Bose systems the speakers have different ohm values then traditional car stereo equipment, so the speakers will be damaged very quickly is wired straight to a aftermaket deck. Besides, this is my girlfriend's car, and she prefers the sound of the bose setup.The thing to understand is the bose system components are designed to work together, and given a proper signal, will do so with better sound from a quality aftermarket deck. The options are to get a deck with strong preamp outputs and use this product, or use a speaker level gain adjustment device like the PAC ROEM-NIS2 for nissan/infinity bose systems. After ordering, the PAC arrived with perfect adjustment, so after install, the system sounds as it should."
2,integration arness,"My mistake in assuming that the arnesses would come with detailed instructions for my vehicle, I assumed it would be plug to plug no soddering no wire nuts, Nuts it is sitting in the box with the radio."
3,for our rv,product is good - but the bolts that are set with an allen wrench keep loosening as the arms are moved- we do adjust the aim of the tv with them daily
5,Perfect,"Holds my computer monitor up above my laptop docking station perfectly. Easy to mount, all hardware included."
5,a worthwhile book,"The author's aproach is directive as opposed to a more cooperative Ericksonian approach, but the book is excellent, usefull, and informative."
2,A must not buy,This book was not helpful in learning hypnosis at all. If you want ideas about hypnosis then buy it. Otherwise do not buy.
4,Highly recommended beginner's book about hypnosis,"This is my first ""Complete Idiot's Guide"" book and I found it to contain a huge of information and to be very well written. It is probably one of best books about hypnosis for a beginner. However, it doesn't contain any information about a highly advanced hypnosis technique that I hoping it might have."
1,"Should be called ""Guide to Being Hypnotized""","I was completely misled about this book. It does not tell you at all how to perform hypnosis. It tells you how to BE HYPNOTIZED by someone else--that is, what to expect, what is possible, how to find a hypnotherapist and so on. It is not a self-help book at all; after reading this book you will not be any more able to help yourself than you were before. This is a ""how to be helped by someone else"" book."
1,"Positive thinkung, not hypnosis","The book is well written if a guide for positive thinking, and basics of self hypnotism. It is weak in the areas of induction, depth of trance, and hypnotic phenomena. The positive thinking approach suggested is valid, but barely touches on hypnotism in many chapters."
3,True Southern wit,"Not sure if this kind of hokey Southern humor is everyone's cup of iced tea, but I laughed out loud more times reading this book than any other book I can remember."
1,useless timex product,"I have tested this gps-watch, for about two months, in running and biking, in different parts of my country, Venezuela and in the US, im very dissapointed with this watch, it only works for few minutes every time i try to use it during training, it seems the gps unit is not very sensitive, and keeps loosing the signal, you don't get speed, or distance measurements most of the time. I don't recommend buying this product."
5,Unbelievable History Centered Around a Fictional Love Story,"Speak to Her Kindly is a wonderfully crafted, unbelievably ""true story"" which keeps your interest throughout the book. The way the two separate story lines come together keeps you intruiged and wanting more. I didn't want to stop reading and finished it in two days. The style of this historical fiction presents aspects for all readers: a love story, medieval history, Biblical truth, glory, guts, and gore. It shows the real struggle of early ""reformed"" Christians but doesn't hide what it was like to live in the 16th century. The true history of this novel seems more fiction than the fictitious parts. After reading this book I find myself ""speaking more kindly"" to my wife, family and others. Not only is this a great story, it leads and teaches the reader something about what living is all about."
2,NOT THE CONSTITUTION,"I have the ship model the USS United States and the Constitution,and this is just a smaller scale fo the Constitution 1/96 scale.the gentelman with the other review is quit right this is NOT WHAT IT APPERIES TO BE. It is a misleading iteam and should be corrected.It is a nice model but it is NOT what it says on the box."
5,A great evaluation of the Black 24th Infantry,I am of the age that I knew many of men of the 24th. I have heard them tell how they were singled out and maligned. My brother-in-law died in Korea because of white officers incompetence and white troops buging out. Finaly a good reviw of all of the troups.
4,"Black Soldier, Wghite Army","This is a very detailed book about the Korean War. It's quite interesting for History buffs and people interested in segregation/desegregation. It reveals some real truths about the war and the men who fought, both black and white."
4,Looks great!,"I bought these mirrors on a whim and never realized how nice it would turn out. I had a different idea at first and then they had a picture using the mirrors to accent a shelf. I went with that look and it looks amazing (and i am no decorator) I did buy 2 sets, but I had a big area to cover. The only drawback is that each mirror is hung with a good size nail."
3,No evidence these vanilla beans are organic...,"These beans are moist and fragrant, however there is nothing to indicate on the packaging that they are actually organic. They arrived packaged in a plastic jug with a label indicating they are a product of Madagascar, but nothing about their being organic. When I pay extra for an ""organic"" product, I expect something to validate that claim. If they are actually organic, they are obviously not certified organic, so we are just supposed to take their word for it, I guess."
5,Vanilla Beans,I was so happy to receive an abundant supply of really succulent beans . They were just wonderfully fragrant and were very reasonably priced. The company shipped them to me very nicely packaged with even a small gift included just for ordering. They shipped the beans to me very quickly . I would recomend this company and will always buy from them in the future. I will be looking into purchasing other products from them in the future besides their lovely vanilla beans.
5,Good beans,I used these beans to make homemade vanilla extract. I thought the vanilla beans were a good quantity and moist. I made three huge bottles of vanilla extract and a couple bags of vanilla sugar.
5,Will buy again,"Beans arrived earlier than expected and were in great condition. Long, fragrant and moist beans...more than I expected. Have used them in a few recipes already. Will definitely reorder when I need more vanilla beans. Great value for the price!"
2,Not helpful for contractors,"While this book should be read by every HR person and every supervisor or manager ever hiring a temp or contractor, it is a superficial overview of the contingency staffing industry. As a technical contractor, I was hoping to obtain a better understanding of the ins and outs of the industry to improve the types of contact assignments I obtain. This book doesn't provide that insight."
3,Not quite as quick to warm up,"Although I am a big Ralph fan, I am only luke warm about his latest release. There are several good songs on this, but they lack the warmth and originality of his previous CDs. It is still preferred over other kid selections, but I am more likely to turn this off when my kids are not around. This CD may take a little more time to fully enjoy. If new to Ralph, select either of his first 3 CDs, which are excellent!Kid's Favorite track: Ants in Pants"
5,Fulfilling Fantasy For The Mind & Eyes,"I am just absolutely captivated by the A Distant Soil series. I own the original 1987 book and 1989's Knights of the Angel. Not only does Colleen feed your mind with the story, but your eyes with the illustrations!! For those who don't already own it, I highly suggest trying to find it. I already have Amazone.com searching for 1997's The Gathering."
3,TOO LONG A WAIT,"The book was in great condition, just came almost a week after the end time. I needed it for a gift and I had to give it late. I was really upset even sent a notice to the seller, my friend loved it, she had the original series at one time and is just now looking into getting them again. I was happy with the condition just not the service."
2,textbook,"This textbook has a poor format. There are very distracting boxed off sections of the book. There are questions asked throughout the book in some of these boxes and the answers are not clear. There are an incredible number of terms to learn and no good method to learn them, no quiz, no feedback. There are essay questions at the end of the chapters, and no answers to those questions in the back, so, you are never quite sure if you are 'getting it"". The book comes with a web page for support, but it too is poorly designed and not worth the added cost if you buy the book used. Overall I give this book a D+.I am glad I was able to purchase this textbook through Amazon, the college bookstore wanted $40. more for it."
4,A good introductory book on options,"This is a good introductory book on options.Pros: comprehensive coverage of a subject,fairly easy to read and understand for a beginner in options.Cons: the same concepts explained multiple times in different parts of the book. That's probably because chapters are written by different people. For example, look at put-call parity or covered call in the index. It's not a reference book. A short chapter summarizing option trading strategies in one place is clearly missing."
4,Fun but not always accurate,"I absolutely love Usborne books! I homeschool my K and 2nd graders with several Usborne books and even my husband can't put them down. HOWEVER, I have found this book to be inaccurate in reference to Christian and Jewish history. This has not proven to be a problem because I simply use the inaccuracies to teach my children about truth and inaccuracies."
5,Very memorable,"Someone gave me this book when it first came out and I was about seven. I must have read it hundreds of times--it was totally captivating. I went on to study History at an Ivy League school. Coincidence? Well, probably. But I think any curious child would love this book. I remember it vividly and am about to buy a copy for a young cousin. I'll be sure to read it again myself, too.Note: I am editing my review five years later in response to the reviews of home-school parents that have appeared since. I have no idea why anyone would consider this an appropriate history *textbook.* It is a very broad overview--a good free-reading book for a young child. The content isn't objectionable if you don't have a particular agenda. I guess there are some nude people, but the illustrations are tiny and it's definitely tamer than National Geographic!"
1,Do not waste your money on this book.,"I, too, purchased this book on the recommendation of JessieWise Bauer author of The Well Trained Mind. I was extremelydisappointed in the quality of the book. This book was purchased for my elementary aged children's study of world history. My comment is not on the content, but on the illustrations. This book should be rated X for the ( ) pictures it displays. Whether or not the people dressed this way is not of importance. The Illustrator could have used much more discretion. I will not purchase any more books from Usborne Publishing Ltd. END"
2,Returned it because of the drawings of topless women.,"The drawings and illustrations are fantastic except for a few pages with women without tops (shirts). We don't feel that is appropriate for our grade school boys so we returned the book.We could have torn out the pages or tried to cover them, but felt that wasn't the best solution."
1,The Usborne Book of World History,This book is written in a comic book format. My children have not liked any of the books by this company. I homeschool my children and you are better off without this evolutionary guide to history.
1,WAY TOO MUCH NUDITY...just not neccessary,I agree with other people who have stated there is WAY too much nudity for young minds! They shouldn't need to put so much details to nude body parts in order to teach a lesson on World History. Very disappointing and I am returning this right away. I don't even want this in my house!!
3,Not as great as it could be,In general I appreciate Usborne books. This one has too much nudity for my taste and too much emphasis on ancient religions. I much prefer Usborne's Ancient World.
1,not recommended,"I ordered this book to supplement our first grade world history and was completely unimpressed. The information may have been accurate and presented at the appropriate level, but the layout and depictions were terrible. There was hardly a page that didn't have graphic drawing of naked men and women. I found it difficult to even do history at all with this material. I do not recommend this book."
1,politically correct tripe,"""Politically correct"" because Catholic-bashing is the last ""respectable"" bigotry. Other reviewers have chronicled some of the transgressions of biased ""history,"" so it is not necessary to recapitulate them here.The profuse graphics cannot salvage the hodge-podge presentation and bigotry.I am glad I kept my receipt."
2,Illustration brings down book value,"I bought this book for my home schooled third grader. Although it is full of valuable information, it never leaves my bookshelf. The reason we never use it sounds silly, but it is important to let others know...we dont use it because it is full of nudity. I can understand a few pages on which the people have no clothes, but this is not the case. The illustrator drew naked people on the majority of the pages! I dont know why...but it is quite disturbing -even for an adult."
4,History in a Hurry,The history of the world in 191 pages is quite an achievement. I used this book for home schooling my eight year old grandson and had no trouble keeping his interest and enthusiasm because every page has attractively drawn pictures. The pictures have a kind of Where's Wally approach to detail which we found entertaining as well as informative. Recommended for children because this book makes history fun for all levels of intellect. I have also sent it to third world countries for use where access to good education is limited.
3,Not for young children,"The Usborne Book Of World History has wonderful pictures and great facts. Like other Usborne books it captivates the reader with interesting tidbits.It does tell about religous beliefs of other societies (which could be used as a teaching point for Christian children if desired). The main thing I did not like was the content of some pictures. There are photos in here that conservative parents will find offensive. Some of them show violence, and others show nudity. While some of the pictures are ""cartoonish"" there are others that are more real, complete with pubic hair. If this book is to be used I would not recommend it for any child below 8th grade (around 13 or 14 years old). Overall it's a great book with some adult content."
3,Eeeks..I'm going to say OK,"I typically love anything Usborne, so I don't know why I can't get into it. This just isn't my favorite. This is required for Sonlight 2nd grade curiculum. I have many friends who look fondly on this book. I wonder if I had children who liked to get up in my lap and read if I would like it better? I have triplets and they each have different personalities and none of them look at the pictures while I'm reading it. I find myself just reading the required pages and moving on."
4,Utterly Satisfying.,"NO MAN'S LAND is Dawson's newest novel, and first published full-length work based on his experiences as a teacher in prison writing workshops. Dawson's prose is as sharp as always, and the interaction between the main character and his pupils is expressed precisely (though not stalely) through dynamic dialogue. Congrats also to Mike Sherick of Times Change for the simple yet elegant design of the book. Fans of Dawson take heed, this man just won't slow down!"
1,Not the version you think it is,"This is not the radio version with the 'normal' Alanis cover of the song Crazy. It's just a whole lot of mixes. If that's what you're after then cool. If not, there is another version of this single on amazon - that's the one that you want. Ordering this version can lead to huge disappointment, just beware."
4,Crazy Could Have Been Longer,"I thought the single was good except that it did not have all the versions of the song on it. I recently got a seven track promo version with the Glen ballard mix which should have been one this CDS. Oh well, if you collect up Alanis's recordings, it is wise to look for the promo single as well. Judemac (search MSN for ""judemac"" for my site)"
3,A Radical Change!,"I more or less could not believe what I heard when I put on this new Alanis Morissette CD single. Her well-known rock approach seemed to be completely absent. This more or less sounded like a mainstream pop-tune aimed at the MTV- or similar charts. Actually I came to think of Her pre-Jagged Little Pill Album ""Now is the Time"", which I bought recently from sheer curiosity of how she sounded in 1992.Now I have listened to the song several times, and I must admit that it's really quite a strong pop song, but obviously radically different from her usual style.The B-side version is is a techno/disco version of the same song. Terrible; hard to endure all 6 minutes!"
4,"Somewhat thin and dated, not Gardner's best work","Martin Gardner is the best of the psuedoscience debunkers out there and his Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science is a perennial favorite. (I assign it to my freshman seminar students in philosophy of science.) This volume is thinner and seems more dated somehow, probably the pseudoscience topics didn't stay current. Sure there's good stuff here on Crowley and the Gaia Hypothesis, but Oral Roberts surely needs no more exposure and Rhine has faded away. We've moved past Reagan's reliance on astrology through the far scarier Bush years.I'd recommend this only after the other Gardner books. It's good, but far from his best material."
2,Hated this book,I am a psychology major and I was so dissapointed in the book and how it bounced around. This book didn't teach me a darn thing!
3,Personality,"This is kind of a dull textbook...I guess if you need it get it, but i wouldn't read it for pleasure."
4,Beautiful,"I ordered this necklace, and when I received it, I originally got a black pearl. I contacted the seller, and they promptly shipped me the correct color, although I did ask for a size upgrade to the 9.5mm (perfect size) and an 18 inch chain. The pearl is exactly as described, high luster, uniform round shape. I love it, I wouldn't exchange it. I wear it as an every day piece. I received the best customer service from this company, I would definitely order their product again. The only reason I knocked one star off was because the 16 inch chain included is a little small and I didn't receive the correct color on the first try. They said it was a warehouse mistake, but they corrected it promptly."
3,Laptop RAM,Inexpensive replacement for an older laptop that I didnt want to spend a lot of money on. Didn't have any problems with it in the time I was using the laptop
5,Absolutely Uplifting and Spirit Filled,"All I can say is that the music is powerful, and the singing is even moreso. Every cell in the bodies of these singers is filled with the Spirit of the Lord. You hear it, you feel it and when you sing along you are filled and transformed too!"
5,special,I love these folks what a great career and ministry they had and still have i love every album they ever did and got to see them live in berkely california in 1984 the singer sower tour while i was in culinary school at treasure island it was awesome shortly after that tour these hymns tapes came out it was before cd's i got them but after a few years they got eaten in the tape machine or lost during a move i got em back on cd and better than ever thanx for all the joy and memories you gave us i love you!!
3,Cases are too similar,"I want to know whether my mother is suffering, I want to know whether she is aware of her disease, and if so, what does she think of it. I want to know what, if anything, I can say or do to comfort her.And after reading Lisa Snyder's book I still don't have a clue.Mom's symptoms of Alzheimer's appeared a year and a half ago. She can not, or will not, talk about it. And in this short time her condition has deteriorated mightily. But she isn't like any of the subjects in this book. The people Lisa writes about seem to be at an earlier stage, and to be very self-aware and open to concepts such as therapy. I cannot draw much from their stories.That said, the book is well written and interesting, and it gives me some comfort to read of people who are living fairly well with this very sad disease. For many readers this will be a 4- or 5- star book, but not for me, not at this time."
1,False Advertising,"We were expecting a table and chairs because we typed ""table and chairs"" in the search area. We were extremely surprised to receive only the table today. A complete rip-off for $89. I could have purchased something of better quality with chairs for less... Amazon: please refrain from putting chairs in the picture if your only going to sell the table. Or, at least, specify ""chairs sold separately"" in parenthesis in the title of the product listing."
2,Quality not so good,For the price the Walmart brand is a lot better. Hard to unwrap and smaller then what we have purchased in the past from Walmart.
1,Ego at Sunset,"This book is horrible. Never mind the simplistic genetic philosophy straight out of Himmler. Jews are Cro Magnon and your basic Aryan is Neandethal, or is the other way around? Like the first reviewer said every other sentence is plugging his other two books which I actually enjoyed. In this he had no rational editor to filter the racist egotistical element out and keep his interesting material in. I think the author would benefit or perhaps pass out, if he read Norma Goodrich's book on the Holy Grail where she discusses the theory that Chretien De Troyes the first medieval author to mention the Grail was a converted Jew and perceived the Grail as a the Jewish Passover plate! Avoid this book unless you like reading 'Mein Kampf' on breezy summer day!"
5,Swords at Sunset traces Holy Grail to North America,"Much like his bestselling novelThe Magdalene Mandalaauthor Michael Bradley has again tapped into his Holy Grail expert credentials (he's written many books on the Grail and was a researcher for The Da Vinci Code movie).But unlikeThe Magdalene Mandala, Bradley's Swords at Sunset is a nonfiction work that utilizes archeological evidence to support his well argued contention that the Holy Grail - the carriers of the Jesus bloodline - were smuggled into North America by the Knights Templar centuries before Columbus set foot here.This is an absolutely fascinating book by a true expert on the Holy Grail. Highly recommended."
3,Not quite what I had expected,The color of the plastic is red. Red is a very difficult color to paint overand at times I thought I would stop building/painting it. I kept at it andit did turn out OK but not one of my best pieces.
1,looks a LOT better than it is .,The picture of this boat is very deceiving . When you receive it its a BIG box with little thin plastic parts . i had to add plaster of paris into the hull to make it stand up . It probably weighs about 6 ozs when you get it . Not worth the money and very disappointed .piece of junk!
2,E for effort F for quality,When I was a kid a model like this would have probably cost $1.98. . . .this model is not worth it. Way overpriced IMHO..
5,Breakheart Pass by Jerry Goldsmith rocks!,"I purchased the original motion picture soundtrack to ""Breakheart Pass"" by Jerry Goldsmith because I had the movie on DVD and I liked the soundtrack. Anyone who is familiar with Jerry Goldsmith knows he is an accomplished composer. I highly recommend this CD."
5,Excellence,"The Dover Full Score editions are an unprecedented buy these days. Scores, especially full orchestral, much less works like the Missa (with addition of full chorus and soloists) are so often impossible to read, poor type/space, etc. This edition is well-bound, beautifully printed, ample space for notations (and I make MANY as I study); such a great bargain. The company also delivered swiftly and packaged the book well, it arrived it perfect condition. Excellence all around. I also have the Complete Beethoven Symphonies, Mozart Piano Concerti, etc. many Dover scores and they are above all others. Don't waste your money on anything else. Even the cover designs are handsomely done and make an aesthic accent on the desk top!"
3,FYI,"For those thinking of purchasing this edition, keep in mind that like many Dover scores, this one uses C-cleff notation. I'm not sure if I am supposed to be reviewing the work, or the edition. But I assume it's the edition, since nothing I say could possibly effect the way the music world's opinion of the great Missa Solemnis. Other than the cleff, it's a quality score."
4,one of the better transcription collections,"This is actually Volume 2 (1995), and contains EIGHT (not eighty) transcriptions of Bill Evans piano parts off the recordings. This collection is better than Vol. 1. First, vol. 1 did not transcribe the comping behind the bass solos. Second, vol. 1 focused on the late Fantasy & early Warner Bros. recordings (1970s), while this collection ranges from the first trio on Riverside, some Verve solo and trio sides, and solo sides from Fantasy. Gripe: when transcribing trio recordings, is it too much to ask that the bass part also be transcribed? Songs: ""Autumn Leaves"" (mono version), ""Spring is Here,"" and ""What is This Thing Called Love"" from PORTRAIT IN JAZZ; ""Here's That Rainy Day"" from ALONE; ""I Should Care"" and ""Make Someone Happy"" from TOWN HALL; ""The Touch of Your Lips"" and ""What Kind of Fool am I"" from ALONE (AGAIN). No extras (vol. 1 had a short essay and photos)."
5,Great TV!,"We got our TV that we needed when ours died. This was the perfect size for what we needed, it came quickly, and the price was right. Would do business again."
2,Great If It Will Turn On,"I took the TV out of the box, plugged it in and nothing. After pushing the on/off switch repeatedly, it finally came on. Picture and sound were terrific so I was very pleased. Turned it off with the remote. Of course, the TV wouldn't turn on again with either the remote or the switch. Pushed the switch about 10 times and it finally came on. I called Panasonic customer service who could not do anything to fix it by phone. So now my new TV is in for a warranty repair less than 24 hours after I received it. Talk about frustrating!!!"
4,Shocking!,"This guide has a complete listing of the books and movies up to ""The World is Not Enough."" It's a light and entertaining read for casual Bond fans or for people who don't know much about the older Bond movies, like myself. However, I can't imagine that hardcore Bond fans could enjoy this. Probably those fans know more about Bond than is included in this book. The listings for the books are about a page each, and for the movies rarely exceeds two pages. So if you've seen all the movies or read all the books, then I don't recommend it for you. However, if you'd like to have an introduction into the world of Bond, it's an excellent book. I thouroughly enjoyed it from cover to cover."
4,Great 007 Reference Material,"This is a great reference book for 007. It's interesting to read how the book ranks and rates movies, novels, etc.One of the most interesting parts of the book is the background on the code number 007, dating back a couple of centuries.Like every 007 reference book, there is a lot of overlap with other books, but, like the other reference books available, it has some unique attributes making it worth the purchase."
4,Beautiful haunting music,"The combination of Mary Asque's beautiful, haunting vocals and the gentle ambience/electronica music is both soothing and dreamy."
2,Thought this book might help me a lot,"This book contains typos that lead to wrong answers. The strategies given is not easy to adapt. The explanations sometimes is weird too; why can't you explain the answers accurately, instead of using Joe Bloggs as the reasons? If you are studying GMAT, please use Kaplan first. Kaplan books are much more informative and accurate."
5,Excellent purchase,The transaction was great and the product has been extremely helpful in studying for the GMAT. A 'must buy' for anyone taking the GMAT.
3,Best of the lot but had problems with the software,I wrote my test recently and scored 750. This book is the closest to the real test besides ETS paper tests I used.I had issues with the software they provided as I had to upload the results to the princeton review website and I couldnt get a final score initally though I could review each question individually.Hopefully Princeton Review has fixed these issues by now.
2,Software is horrible!,"Like many of the other users, I took a test using the enclosed cd. When I had finished sitting for 3 hours, I waited eagerly for my score. Unfortunately retrieving my score pinned my CPU at 100% for about 20 mintues. Multiple attempts at this throughout the day didn't help. I never did receive my score. So I went and bought Kaplan's book which has the answers included on the CD."
2,Practice exams the only saving grace,"The strategies in this book are some of the worst I've ever seen in my life. They make stupid recommendations like, ""If you think the question is difficult, you can rule out the obvious answer as being correct."" The entire strategy they present is based on second-guessing what the writer of the quesiton was thinking. If you want to play psychologist during your exam this might be right up your alley, but I'd rather spend my time studying to be able to arriving at the correct answers on my own.The questions in the book are far too easy. If you want practice questions stick to the offical GMAT guide.As the title of my review indicates, the exams are the saving grace of this book. Why? They let you practice taking a 4 hour long test using software similar to that used for the real test."
3,Very Easy,"Princeton book and CD ROM test for GMAT is very easy. I used to score 790 or 800 in this and got 730 in the actual exam. well if you need confidance during the final days of preparation which I think is the most important thing to do, you can give TEST in princeton. But it has good examples on MATH."
1,Big Disappointment! Unfriendly software. -5 stars!,"Why? Why PrincetonReview made such an unfriendly software? You have to go through logins,passwords, verifications and the internet in order to use it and see your score. IF you get to see it! I took 4 tests and am still waiting for the e-mail!There are many good books for the GMAT out there. Buy something else."
1,Inconsistent Data Sufficiency Questions,"The data sufficiency portions of this book are incredibly inconsistent. Specifically the geometry problems. The drawings for these questions are not to scale. Sometimes the answer-explanations remember this, sometimes they forget this. In some questions, the explanations make assumptions that do not exist in the diagram, in other questions if you make these assumptions, you are told that you should not.There are a few typos in some of the questions that lead you to make the wrong answer selection.Overall, the multiple-choice math questions are correct. Find a different source for data sufficiency problems."
3,Cracking the GMAT 2008,I used Princeton Reviews SAT book and was well pleased. I pushed my score to the 1300 mark. I'm now eyeing graduate school and am hoping for the same results with this book. I just finished my first run through of this book. Overall I was pretty pleased. The thought process undergone to construct the book is in a methodical manner that is conducive to learning. Much better than Kaplans. My main complaint is the lack of content in the gramar certain areas of the math section. Some of the teaching logic is fundamentaly flawed. If you don't need to re-visit some of your weak areas and are to use this as a strategic guide then I would say it would be well worth your money. But some of the areas that I honestly have not had to think about since maybe grade school seemed lacking in all areas. Hope this helped.
1,"This Book is SICK..DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY","I'm preparing for the GMAT, with KAPLAN GMAT, KAPLAN 800, Princeton and ETS [official guide] together. It seems that the book has been written by some 10th grade students. [ It was funny when you see that to explain their Maths problems they'll say, ""if you put weired number in it, you'll get the answer"" , Damn, I need an example Man]. Hey, can someone give me two fractional numbers with their product and sum both result in an Interger,These guys say you can find one [ without an example].Hey, Guys..Serious Advice. Don't burn your money in this book. If you get it for free from library or somewhere else, just flip through the pages to work on some more questions."
3,Quite dissapointed,"I am actually quite disappointed with the Princeton Review Cracking the GMAT book. I was expecting they will refresh my memory on math, remind formulas. Instead, they put a lot of efforts on teaching how to guess the answers. For me, it is easier to solve the problem than to learn new techniques on guessing. When I guess, I am not certain about the correct answer. When I studied this book, I've got a feeling that the GMAT is an easy test, but indeed it is not.I wouldn't recommend this book to those GMAT takers, who plan to score 700 and higher."
2,Not that great,"The book itself does not provide many practice questions. You are then forced to use the CD ROM, which has software that is pretty buggy. It would continually crash and I was unable to upload my results to their website for review.Even worse than that, the questions were not very similar to the Official GMAT questions..."
1,Don't waste your money or time,"Short and simple:- This book is full of errors- The online material also has ridiculous amounts of errors and the same questions as what is in the book (i.e. you already know the answers when you try to take a full length test, which does not give you an accurate portrayal of your score)- The online platform is difficult to navigate and fails to save your scores (not that they're valid anyway considering they just cycle the same questions through all four ""full length tests"")- The DVD offers no new insight or practice questions, but simply puts what is in the book into a boring video formatSave yourself the effort and time and go straight for the official GMAT study book. I will take the GMAT for the first time later this month and wish I could get a refund on this poorly constructed and edited study guide..."
5,Good review book,I was referred to use this book from a friend who had taken the Gmats. This book and the verbal and math book by Princeton has helped my score to improve on the practice test. Hopeful that will be the case when it comes to the real test.
4,Great overall review for the GMAT,"For those who want to take the GMAT and have been out of school for awhile, this book gets you up to speed on the basics. I wouldn't use this book alone (they mention this in the book also). Coupled with a class or ""official"" GMAC practice tests you should increase your overall GMAT score. Good luck on the test!"
2,Not one of Hutson's best.,"Sorry, but I just couldn't get into this one, was about halfway through when I gave up. There are plenty of shootings and the like but they never seem to come together to form a story, and there were no sympathetic characters to identify with. Fans of thrillers might be entertained, however."
2,There are better versions available!,"The choreography and production values in general are lacking in this version of the ballet of Romeo and Juliet. This features a younger Besstomova who goes on to become a very good ballerina, but in this role, there is none of the passion or youth of Juliet. Romeo is no better. The sets are uninteresting and the costumes kinda tacky. The chorography isn't there either. It's generally uninteresting to watch, and the ending scene where Romeo dances with the dead Juliet is truly puzzling. She is at first stiff as a board, but still manages to be manuevred into very flexible positions. If you want a better Romeo and Juliet, try one choregraphed by MacMillian in the Royal Opera Ballet or something or Anthony Tudor's version. This one is for the birds!"
5,fan controller,good controller for the price...i modified it by drilling my radiator core and used a tap to cut the correct threads for the sensor.
1,Melted,I ordered this for a new Derale fan and it lasted only a couple days. The fuse holder was defective and melted. It also wrecked the wiring as it got so hot.
2,Very educational but be careful around young children.,"My 5 year old was sent home from kindergarten aft playing with this toy for about a week. Suffice it to say that ""inappropriate"" and ""invades personal space"" came up a few times over the phone."
4,Realistic but...,"The additional cost of the optional cavity search sigmoidoscopy made this an unrealistic purchase for the average 3rd grader. Otherwise, very realistic."
3,Not enough 'racial profiling',My kids were so excited to get this toy and were waiting for the post each day until it finally arrived.You could imagine my disappointment when we opened it up and all the figures were white.How do I teach my children the importance of racial profiling without at least one darker skinned person? Where is the turban? It didn't even have a Qur'an....What is the fun in having some boring white woman who doesn't even need to take her shoes off to get through security?
1,This toy is missing parts,"This toy isnt much fun.It's also missing naked playmobil children and playmobil little old ladies getting cavity searched by the TSA agents. I mean, how can you have realistic police state fun without that?I'm waiting for Playmobil to bring us ""Fast and Furious: Mexican Gun Walk"" where we see BATF agents permitting drug cartel characters buy guns and cross the border with them."
3,Need more rubber gloves,Kind of disapointed it only came with 1 set of gloves for the body cavity searchs. Should have come with alot more
4,More detailed but more costly than Israeli Checkpoint,"This set is Waaaaay better than the ""Israeli Checkpoint"" set that nobody is buying, in which there are, like, no machines, no weapons, and absolutely no action whatsoever since no bad guys can penetrate it."
3,Needed the upgrade pack,"At first it looked as though my Playmobil terrorist cell was going have trouble getting through this security system - no naked flames, sharp objects, guns or bombs. Then I bought the Tobacco Lobbyist upgrade pack which allowed cigarette lighters to be carried through so they simply torched the plane instead. Hours of fun for all the family."
4,Valuable life lessons packaged in bright plastics,"I purchased this product (along with the Playmobile ambulance/mass casualty incident set and the Playmobile road construction set) for my five year old son. After a few hours my son asked me why our society was so keen on infringing on the civil liberties of its citizens in the name of safety and security. Like all the other five year olds whose parents purchased this product, he is precocious and wise beyond his years.I answered that everyone still has the right to walk anywhere in this country, and that everything else is a privilege and not a right. People who voluntarily surrender their freedoms on the altar of personal convenience have no right to complain about it afterwards. My son is now well on his way to becoming an anarchist.I wish this toy had been around when I was a child so that we might have learned important life lessons rather than the fluffy sugar-coated false utopia of Rainbow Bright and Friends."
1,Orange Alert: Metal Detector Is Outdated Technology,"The enclosed metal detector is insufficient to counter today's terrorists, increasingly armed with plastic explosives. Only a full-body scanner (known as a naked body scanner to the general public) can detect plastic explosives where they are most likely to be hidden: in underwear.Children who use this station are putting their dolls at risk each and every time they fly out of the Playmobil airport!"
3,Teaching Respect for the State Security Apparatus,"I like the basic idea. I applaud Playmobile for attempting to provide us with the tools we need to teach our children to unquestioningly obey the commands of the State Security Apparatus, but unfortunately, this product falls short of doing that. There's no brown figure for little Josh to profile, taser, and detain? Where are all the frightened plastic Heartlanders pointing at the brown figure as they whisper ""terrorist?"" Where are the hippy couple figures being denied boarding passes? And shouldn't someone be forcing a mother figure to drink her own breast milk?"
3,Missing minority customer,"When I bought this toy, I was looking forward to placing my minority-action figure through the metal detector, and then running the little script I prepared: ""Excuse me sir, but you have been 'randomnly' selected for additional scans. Please let us take a sample from your shoe while the computer analyzes findings for any radioactive or biohazardous material"".It's too bad that they never came out with the ""Pat-Down"" edition, where fat guards are groping women for weapons, and turning customers away who refuse the degrading method of search.My only suggestion is that if this is based on the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, please don't forget to include the bums who torment you for spare change. Thanks!"
1,The Police state,"This is a wonderful example of how the US/World police state is bearing down on us hard and heavy. I suppose if you want your child to learn unconstitutional ways of dealing with public security then this is a must buy. This will undoubtedly show anyone that if your a passenger on an airplane, then your deserve to be tasered and naked body scanned. This toy represents everything that is wrong with the world. Pretending to be a TSA agent or (Government thug) isn't on my priority list. I hope anyone considering to buy this toy understands that this is just another conditioning item used by the establishment in power today. You are scum and deserve to be humiliated in public in the name of ""Security"". Propoganda sure and simple. Btw, these men come with guns to drive fear into the terrible citizen trying to get on his flight."
1,My little constitution included?,Does this include a pocket constitution complete with the 4th Amendment of the Bill of Rights? What a farse. This is just another step toward the Orwellian States of America. Ban the TSA.
1,Welcome to the NWO baby!,"Its really sad...welcome to the new America! A place where your freedoms are no more. Where you can get felt up by men and women who have no right to do so. All the while the sheeple sick back and say nothing, they let it happen. Dear America, I'm so disappointed in you! I'm sure our founding fathers are rolling over in their graves. I'm sure they are disgusted we've allowed the government to turn into the tyrannical bunch of mobsters they are."
1,Are we readying our children for a Police State?,"Yeah, let's instill fear in our children and ready them for the Police State they will live in.Very poor choice for a toy.Buying this for your child, only shows you ignorance and apathy towards the world you live in."
2,The New Deluxe Version is Much Better,"If you can afford it splurge and get the new deluxe version. New action figures include Agent Sticky Fingers in his dual role of invasive cavity searcher and small valuables thief. (Not necessarily in that order) It also includes the Michael Chertoff figure complete with pockets full of cash from entering into self serving government contracts. And don't forget Agent Mel Lignacy the ""harmless body scanner"" operator and ten year TSA veteran. Mel was just transferred in from DFW in a thinly veiled attempt by his superiors to avoid a cancer cluster lawsuit. Playmobil and TSA: Keeping the traveling public safe since never! *4th amendment not included"
1,Deeply disappointed. Was saving up for the $5K version...,"but they've taken it down:""This item will be released on January 1, 2037. Pre-order now! Ships from NJ, United States. Expedited shipping available.Some dings and scratches on hand-held security wand and passenger spinal column. Includes realistic PLAYMOBIL Damage-to-Property Report for damage to carry-on luggage lock and missing iPad. Seated screener's functionality may increase with refill of Nuvigil prescription for shift work sleep disorder (sold separately through PLAYMOBIL Take Along Doctor's Office and PLAYMOBIL Doctor figure in conjunction with PLAYMOBIL Federal Employees Health Insurance Plan). Also see my listing for gently used PLAYMOBIL Backscatter X-ray Scanner (missing original packaging). Coming Soon: Like-New PLAYMOBIL Millimeter-Wave Scanner (with realistic 23%-54% false-alarm rate)""It would be AWESOME to have the PLAYMOBIL Federal Employees Health Care Plan!"
2,Bored w/it already,My kid is bored with it already. Disappointed that there were no instructions for pat downs and no female TSA employees to pat down the women...daughter had a fit! I was looking at the Stop and Search (Brooklyn Edition) scheduled to come out next Christmas. Complete set comes with innocent citizens of various ethnic backgrounds of color. Should be a hit.
1,Its's very realistic...,"I don't understand those reviewers who feel this toy is unrealistic. Didn't you read the information provided by the manufacturer? The woman passenger was in such a hurry that she grabbed her luggage but completely neglected her cash and wallet, which without doubt were pocketed by the TSA agent who had just, um, ""screened"" her. Very realistic indeed!"
3,miniature reality.,"Right up front, I was a little upset when my Playmobile Security Checkpoint arrived in the mail. The package appeared to be opened and resealed with printed tape bearing the TSA logo. Inside was a bright green tag stating that the TSA has searched my purchase for contraband.Once I got past this issue, the rest of the play experience was quite enjoyable. We purchased the optional Playmobile Body Cavity Search (tm) playset which greatly contributed to the realism of play time. However, the true-to-scale Full Body Image Scanner (tm) expansion pack could have used a less-voluptuous image than provided. And the half-naked TSA viewer was way over the top. Perhaps there is a limit to the realism that my 9-year old should be exposed.All that said, the value was unparalleled and I see this playset being passed from generation to generation."
2,Already looking for a replacement,"Had this item 3 or 4 days now, and things were going fine, until some of the ""passengers"" began complaining of missing items from their luggage. I found the items in a Playmobil Security Manager's Office, which I hadn't realized I ordered. I'm thinking of complaining to the Playmobil Shop Steward but I'm not sure I'll get anywhere -"
3,Do not fly,"The toy works perfectly, but all my son's action figures appear to be on a ""no fly"" list, even the birds.Thank goodness we have a train set or we wouldn't get the other toys anywhere.Is there any way to confirm an action figure can fly before you buy it?The Playmobil airport is in bankruptcy proceedings until they can get more passengers.It seems everyone loses at this game."
3,Fine but needs more action figures...,"The playset seemed well build, but none of the other Playmobil action figures I had seemed to enjoy it very much. In fact most of them complained, and are now being detained in an unknown location...."
2,The government is also a toy factory,"Tyranny is now fun! This is a great way to indoctrinate your children into believing that giving up rights for ""security"" is a good thing. Clothing on passenger can't be removed, so it's not very realistic. Nor do the security figures have gloves on. Health hazard! But that's okay, you get microwaved in the x-ray scanner anyways. But you will notice that each figure is smiling brightly because they know they are now SAFE under the government's watch! Big Brother knows what's best for the people."
1,"No wheelchair passenger getting a cavity search for refusing to ""walk"" through the detector!","As a disabled veteran who has had a lot of (very, um... personal) experience with the results of ""refusing"" to ""walk"" through the TSA detectors when TSA has taken my canes and wheelchair apart to put through the scanner, I found this set was not realistic. It also doesn't show children and grannies getting pulled over for ""advanced screening"" or the hundreds of people giving each other foot fungus while waiting an hour or two to be processed. However, the plastic set, as with the TSA itself, seems remarkably durable despite the 4th amendment, so that was one thing to consider."
1,propaganda material,"what?? are they now teaching young kids that being interrogated is supposed to be NORMAL? You are a fool if you buy this for your child. Wake up stupid americans! The FEMA concentration camps have already been installed throughout the USA, make sure to google that to learn more about the growing police state and what they have planned to control your freedoms."
1,This thing is just wrong,What were they thinking when they made this??? Who would ever give a toy like this to their children? It's bad enough that we have to put up with this in real life.
1,Seriously???,I'll be sure to never buy another Playmobil brand item for my family after seeing this! I shouldn't have to explain why.
1,I am glad it was discontinued.,"Having been a Law Enforcement Officer in the past and being witness to TSA abuses at the airports, I found this toy to be a sad attempt at reaching past the parents and trying to aclimate kids to a police state as the norm.It is not the norm and it is not right.It is despicable the extent to which people are groped at the airports in the name of security and attempting to indoctrinate kids that it is normal, acceptable behavior is equaled in sadness only by the extent to which weakminded parents will go along with it."
1,A Wonderfull learning tool...,"I've heard that they were going to publish a coupon and code, to allow us to buy this for $9.11, they're just waiting for the economy to drop a little more then it currently is. Its a marketing thing I know... In addition they plan on offering a collectors verision that will have the metal detector painted GOLD, though the'll have to use lead based paint because its cost effective. I love toys :-)"
2,Just like the person being screened next to me,I had to wait for an incredibly long time last time I flew. The same idiot was in front of me setting off alarms because he was too stupid to take off his metal claw hands and put them in his checked bag. How inconsiderate can you get.
5,Looking for the FEMA Camp version,"Cant wait for the Fischer-Price FEMA Camp to come out. Complete with razor wire, Brown Shirts and DHS Approved hollow point .40 cal!"
3,Needs a Water Boarding Option,Now that John McCain has decided that Water Boarding (that terrific technique invented by the Spanish Inquisition) is OK in some circumstances it should be added as an option to this Toy. How is the next generation going to learn the benefits and techniques of torture if some of the better torture options aren't made available to them?
1,Have all the toymakers sold their souls too?!,"I agree with most of the reviewers. So, are they going to come out with a FEMA Camp playset so that the young ones will be used to them and when they are sent there (for real) will think it's all just for a play date?! After all of the harmful ingredients and coatings found in or on most major toys lately - most of which are made in China - I think that I'll go to the old work bench in my garage and start making my own. Actually, that would be a great idea for some concerned Americans to do for our kids, who ARE, after all, OUR FUTURE! This country has gone insane!"
1,My toy plane was hijacked!,"I guess the Al-CIA-duh got passed my checkpoint, these little TSA thugs just let the guy pass just because he had a CIA escort. I mean c'mon it's Christmas! Why should I even buy these little figures if they can't even keep my little globalist banker terrorists out of my toy plane. These little figures make great security for my little plastic Justin Beiber concert I made for my daughter :)"
1,U.S. Constitution Not Included; 4th Amendment Null and Void,"This is a great way for kids to see what us grown ups have done to ourselves in the last decade! Now they too can be stripped of their clothing, dignity and possessions - all in the comfort of home! And it's so convenient to be able to train our little ones for life in our Free Society. I mean how amazing is it that we no longer have to endure weeks of pent up anxiety before we travel or go the mall, school, the ballgame or church, worried about what will greet us at everyday events? Now we can so easily familiarize our children with Security Theater and the untrained, unprofessional GED drop-outs who somehow make-up these ragtag ""security"" forces. What a relief! I'm so glad I never again have to worry about how to explain to the kids why they have to be searched without probable cause everywhere they go. I will just hand them this fantastic toy. Perfect! Thanks Playmobil!!!"
3,Would be Perfect...,"My kids and I love playing with this set together! There's nothing like a little bonding time while learning about the police state. Anyway, it's almost perfect; I only have two complaints.1.) The clothes won't come off the figures. How are we supposed to play strip-search WHEN THE CLOTHES DON'T FREAKING COME OFF?!?!?!?! I had to paint one of the figures naked so the kids would pretend to strip-search him. It's just not the same.2.) There's no terrorist figurine or bomb pack. Although I'm sure Playmobil will come out with an expansion pack in the future, right now there's no way to have a terrorist figurine. All my kids can do is pretend to strip search the innocent instead of letting terrorists through.Other than those two problems though, it's a great item. I don't know a better way to teach my kids that people searching and groping them is ok."

2,"so much winging, grow up.","I find this toy hilariously offensive, like British humor.What I don't find entertaining are the adults crying and throwing fits like little children. You complain about a police state, but flip your s*** about terrorism and how more needs to be done to prevent it, well here you go. I swear, I feel like most of the people complaining about a breach of privacy are the old gits. Seriously, no one WANTS to look at your junk and your multiple folds of fat, but go ahead and keep thinking your a stud.I went to a high school with metal detectors; did I complain about a breach of privacy? No. If they want to look at my tampons, go ahead. I'd rather have a bag check then some social reject stabbing a knife into me. It's sad when the kids act more adult than the...well, adults."
3,Not the place to complain about the government.,Amazon.com is not the place about the government. Do you really think the White House and Congress read these reviews?Try this instead: [...]
1,Playmobil Poke n Play Cavity Search Set,I cannot confirm it but there are rumors that they are coming out with a companion product featuring a full body scanner and dolls that have hollow torsos that you can stuff with little round pellets.
1,This is a horrible idea.,Is the construction of the toy meant to get them to accept an authoritarian government? The product is an airport security checkpoint. But it could be accessorized. Could they include pieces that would link it to a jail cell? Perhaps it could include a DVD to show real security tapes of small children being searched so they could learn the proper respect citizens should give to authority. The set should include a grandmother with some sort of contraband so children can learn that even a grandmother could be a terrorist.
3,Not a laughing matter,"Interesting to note that customers who view this item ultimately buy the following Playmobil items:11% - getaway car7% - tanker truck2% - bank counterChildren aren't only the future...they're the future of imaginative terrorist plots!Seriously, though, this toy provides a great way to educate kids about air travel before a big trip. Playmobil's toys hold up well and keep the little ones entertained, so no gripes. One little oddity to point out is that the xray monitor displaying the bag contents shows what appears to be a fire extinguisher, a duck and several brown poo-shaped objects. The kids don't seem to notice, so, hey, whatever floats your boat when you're on the road, right?"
3,Disappointingly unrealistic.,"What's up Playmobil? The characters have no body cavities. I had to spend several of my own hours with a drill press to rectify the oversight, before repacking the set and getting it under the tree before my kids awoke on Christmas morn. Also I had to create mini Sikh/Hindu headgear in order to teach my children how to profile potential Islamic terror-doers. A lot of extra time spent by Mommy and Daddy to make this item work as advertised, but otherwise a lively and fun, educational toy."
2,Playmobil PROFILING!!!!!,"OUTRAGED!!!! We had bought this item in the hopes that it would be an educational tool for our child, but are DISTURBED that it is making our daughter RACIST! Since, she has been profiling all of her PLAYMOBIL people, singling out both the darker-hued one and the one with facial hair for FULL BODY SCANS (we bought the expanded pack with full diversity, supplemental security guards, and ""Undisclosed Location""--because we're not LAZY PARENTS). We are willing to give it TWO STARS only because the full body scanner also presented us with an opportunity to discuss TRANSGENDERISM and THE FOURTH AMENDMENT."
1,Because You Can Never Be Too Safe,"I want to thank Playmobil for adding Item 11 to ""How To Tell if Your Country is Turning Fascist"". Now we can add ""pro-authoritarian propaganda showing up as children's toys"" to the list. I'm sure 1930's Germany had Nazi propaganda bombarding children as well, right from birth."
1,Whats that smell?,"Mommy I performed my first cavity search, look what I found. Great way to teach your kids to be on the wrong side of the police state."
3,All I can say is WOW!!,"This is the perfect playset, I can't wait till it comes back in stock. I am also ordering the 4 additional security screeners standing around to make it 100% authentic.. Thanks PlayMobil"
2,Be careful,Be very careful with this toy. I left it out when I went to bed and I woke up violated. The little plastic guy is just grinning at me. Sick jerk!
4,Teach your children how to exercise their 4th Amendment right!,"What a fantastic way to teach your children how to understand unreasonable search and seizure. Simply keep the figurine from entering the checkpoint with the phrase ""I DO NOT CONSENT"". Act out thousands of situations in which the oppressors flip out, not getting their way. It is important that we know how to exercise our bill of rights, as these scenes are coming to a neighborhood near you!"
3,Normalizing the police state,"I'd rather my child not be 'educated' with toysto believe that this sort of thing should be normal.I worked with some of the folks who were hired post9/11, and many of them were amazed they'd gotten thejob, given their criminal records (something like 30% shouldhave never been hired).Of course, this toy could be used to recreate a more realisticencounter with the TSA (taking scissors away)... that'd beeducational.What's next, the Drug Checkpoint and Asset Forfeiture playset?Building code junior snitch set (with binoculars and notepad)?Ooh...Playmobile BATFE and HRT (Hostage Roasting Team) action figures!"
1,Only a brain dead parent would let their kid play with this!,"Are you that much of a sheep to let your kids play with this? Let me know, I have some fluoride gum and a uranium enriched chicken you can have too.Sick freaks!"
3,Not accurate,"I dunno about you guys, but all I had to do to get through the security checkpoint was to expose my Three Wolf T-shirt. The TSA agents all suddenly turned white like they'd seen a ghost, and let me walk through. I even kept my shoes on.The other inaccuracy I noticed with this product is that it doesn't show the SS and the Führer (Obama) watching security camera footage of the sexual assault lines, from all across the country, from a hidden room in the Whitehouse."
2,Lagging technology.,"I dunno. I pooped my pants and it didn't catch it. Now, flight #487 just smells like my soiled shorts."
5,Wish I could get this one.,"I really wish I could get one of these. I work for TSA and would love to be able to get one for my son. Unfortunately, due to the ranting and raving of a few haters out there, this product has been removed. I do not see the same hateful remarks made about any of the other law enforcement products. Just this one. And SHAME on Playmobil and Amazon for caving to such stupidity and hatefulness. Please consider making these available again."
2,"Lego, Playmobil , Mega Bolks In The News!","Legos avoided guns for a long time but some are now heavily armed . . Im not sure how the Lego characters feel about being scanned by a Playmobil made check point.The good news though is that Legos and Mega Bloks seem to have come to a permanent mutual piece time agreement where both fit perfectly together.This union has only just begun to bear the fruits on diversity, and saved parents money at the same time."
3,Yet another missing piece!,It would seem that the makers of this toy also forgot the Iranian that gets waved through with a French passport with more eraser marks on it than Ben Afflack's trig exam.
1,"What's next, Gestapo Ken and TSA Barbie?","As a friend of mine observed about this toy: ""What's next... 'Gestapo Ken' and 'TSABarbie?'""I suggest that Playmobil stamp ""Arbeit Macht Frei"" above the passenger portal on this item.Don't forget to buy the John Gilmore and Penn Gillette action figures before checking out your purchase."
2,Insufficiently resistent to high concentrations of sulfuric acid.,"I gave this to a neighbor's 6 year old kid as a Christmas gift.When he was coming down off his SSRI drugs he threw the whole thing in a vat of acid (which, by the way, he's inclined to do).The whole thing turned into a sloppy puddle of carcinogenic plastic.Disappointing, Playmobile."
3,Not compatable with other toys.,"Playmobil's proprietary system isn't very practical. My son loves to play with this system, but his GI Joes won't go through the opening. Neither will his matchbox cars, nor his transformers. The security guards just won't allow them through. But does this stop the green army men from passing through? No. How about the nerf darts, essentially tomahawk missiles in Playmobil scale? They pass right through. Whatever deals corporate has brokered with other companies is unfair. Let all toys through, or no toys through."
2,Another story of a failed s7520n Slimline...,"I have two Slimlines... first I bought the S7720n, and a year or two later the s7520n. The first one is still going strong, the s7520n has been nothing but trouble. Hard drive failure, then motherboard (integrated graphic card) trouble. Damn."
2,Flickering problems,"I'm pretty disappointed in this HP box. I like the fact it is compact but it's clear this little box has hardware issues. I've had the motherboard replaced already and started having flickering issues since month 10. The 1GB memory (not expandable) simply can't handle the ""load"", if you want to call internet surfing that. Stick with Dell."
3,Little pc Big problems,I have had this pc for 9 months and we had to replace the Hard drive and now the cd/dvd rom is not working. I have never had this much trouble with a hp before. I don't recommend this Item to anyone. HP has been very helpful so far as to replacing everything under warranty. But what a real pain to have to send everything back. I have to wonder how long the new part are going to last. They have asked if I want to buy a warranty for another year. It makes me wonder.
3,Watch the price changes!,"It's a good-looking, nicely operating patio umbrella, but be aware of a couple of things: the price fluctuated several times while I was trying to order, from $39 to $99 and numbers in between, so I kept checking till it came down to $49 and ordered it. I checked and this happened with all the colors, though an email to the Amazon 'help' desk got a response of, basically, 'No it didn't!'Also, when the umbrella arrived it had no rope for the pulley to raise it and no pin to secure it in the raised position. I still think it's a good deal, but you should know what you're getting."
5,always open,This is a great deal. This umbrella meets all expections. Screw in the top and lower post and you are all ready to go. Shipped in two days free.
1,"If they had been more expensive, I'd have returned them","I ordered 4 of these for our church. They came quickly, in boxes that seemed in good shape. After opening them, 2 of the 4 umbrellas were either torn, stained or both. I guess now I know why they were on sale. They just seemed like they were used. Hmmmm?"
5,Excellent Small Umbrella,"I looked for two years in the stores for a small umbrella for our small glass patio set, but could only find larger umbrellas. The few small umbrellas I did find were online, but the prices were higher than the prices for large umbrellas. I ordered this umbrella when it was a gold box deal, and was shocked when it was on my doorstep the next day! The price was really good, and am very happy with the product. The quality is great, and it is so easy to open and close. The pole is wood, and the accents are gold. It looks great on my upper patio, and is the perfect size for the small space, as it does not interfere with opening the back door. This umbrella is perfect for any small bistro-type table and for someone with a small space."
5,Very impressed,"Before purchasing this umbrella,and scouring stores, I read the reviews which were very helpful. I was searching for an umbrella to be used with our small tile bistro table. The size is PERFECT. It was easy to assemble and is very well made. Classy addition to our deck area. It shipped to me in lightning speed. Great buy!"
5,EXELENTE,"COMO NO PODIA SER DE OTRA MANERA ,EL TRABAJO DE ESTOS DOS ARTISTAS ES EXELENTE.CLUB""AMOR ETERNO"""
3,"Free shipping, really?","The product is great, but the price at my local Walmart (Texas) is $19.77 per can. That computes to 118.62 for 6 cans. For me it is worth the over $62 difference to go to the store and get it myself..."
5,Happy with product,"It may have taken up to a week to receive these, but other than that, I'm pleased with my purchase! Huge time and money saver for me! You can't beat NOT having to take 2 kids to the store, plus free shipping!"
4,Too costly--delivery,"Product is good. Delivery is way too suprise. Original quote of delivery is more than 10 Business days. I have to pay extra to expedite it, than I received it in two days."
2,Rip Van Winkle Hardback,"This book is beautifully illustrated but not for the average upper elementary age child. The are lots of long and unusual words that will prove frustrating to the average 4th & 5th grader. It may work well for a read-aloud, but the momentum of the story will be lost by the time you stop and explain the meaning of so many words. Considering the vocabulary, a high school student could easily enjoy and learn about creative writing from this book."
5,Well-told and illustrated,"We've been re-reading a lot of our old favorite fairy tales, and working in some folk tales and myths, too. Rip Van Winkle is a great old story set in New York colony, and it carries the reader through to post-revolutionary America. Fun message about over-imbibing, and a great running theme about choosing your spouse wisely.The illustrations deserve a mention: Great use of light and shadows in these illustrations, especially in the woods. Great woodland details. GREAT tree roots."
3,A fairy tale.,"Set in the time of the Declaration of Independance of the United States, Rip van Winkle is the story of a man who, upon walking in the mountains with his dog, stumbles upon a strange man with a keg of liquor, and a small company of odd-looking folk playing a bowling game. When he wakes up the next morning, everything he used to know has changed..."
1,"There is no ""after capitalism""","Because there is no ""before capitalism."" A stupid, stupid book designed to trick people into communism."
4,A good account,"Though Coe does not give most of the people in this epic true story much credit, his style is lively and his analysis of the Mayan writing system is good."
2,"Technically good, but the author had scores to settle","This is a competent technical account of solving an unknown language. What spoils the book is the overemphasis on the personal aspects of scientific investigation. A large number of people made contributions towards solving the Mayan 'code', but if an individual didn't get the whole thing all at once, he or she was 'wrong'. Not only that, they were BAD: it is charged that various people erred because they were racists, i.e. they didn't think the Mayan language was complex because the Maya were dark-skinned. This kind of slander leaves a very bad taste in the mouth, and suggests that the author had a number of professional scores to settle. As a working scientist, I am offended by the way this author misrepresents the practice of scientific investigation as a zero-sum game with heroic winners and bad, racist losers. I cannot recommend this book."
2,Not the narrative I was expecting,"This book might be better suited to persons interested in the researchers or already familiar with the basics of the decipherment. I am just a layperson with an interest in the Maya writing. My expectation was a narrative focused around deciphering the writing. Instead, much of the book is a series of mini-biographies about the various researchers throughout history with a couple paragraphs near the end that tie that researcher to the narrative of the decipherment. The result was that the narrative I was interested in came off very choppy and difficult to follow. I do not regret purchasing it, however, for the illustrations are wonderful."
5,Surprisingly readable on difficult subject,"This book is informative, educational and a great read. It contains a wealth of information, not only about Mayan writing but about linguistics as well. I recommend this book highly for anyone interested in Archaeology, Anthropology or Linguistics."
2,really irritating,"The actual details of how the written Mayan language was deciphered and what it was found to say make up a surprisingly small portion of this book. The author's real passion, apparently, is for the politics behind the decipherment and not the decipherment itself. There is some interesting information here, but the snide tone in which it's presented gets to be pretty hard to take."
2,Much to say about nothing,"I saw this book at the bookstore and bought it without reading the online reviews. It had a good inviting title but it never delivered.With a title of ""Breaking Maya the code"" you will think you will learn about the ""Maya code"".The author however goes over the history and steps (mainly misteps as mentions it over and over) taken on ""breaking the code"".I particulary dislike the way the calls out names & ridicules many anthropologyst and other Mayan researchers without a particular explanation to the reader on why. Most of them dead of course so they can not complain right.The author mostly complains about the mistakes and biases of the researchers and never really gets to the code itself. In summary he is very critical of everyone that had to do with the Maya.I will rate this book just as he rates a book by B.M. Norman (page 96); ""The book is on the whole worthless,..."" except for the pictures and photos in the middle.You will not learn any Maya code with this book."
4,An eye opener,"This book is as much about the obstacles in deciphering the Maya script as it is about the language itself. For those without their fingers on the pulse of the scientific community, this book is a real eye opener, illustrating that even in the scientific or academic community where no theory should be accepted as truth without critical testing and proof, politics and emotions can have strong influence on progress. Coe demonstrates that with time and the courage to think independently, mysteries can be solved."
1,horrible!,"This movie was pretty painful to watch, and I am a huge Corey & Corey fan. There are some pretty ridiculous soft core porn scenes with corey feldman that are borderline disturbing... The movie is not funny, makes little sense (and I usually enjoy movies that dont make any sense), and it just plain terrible. Looks like something skin-a-max would show at 3am... Dont buy this unless you just have to have every corey feldman film."
1,Poor imitation,I was very disappointed with this movie. The box cover compares it to Airplane & Naked Gun which are funny movies. This movie is not funny it is stupid. They TRY to be funny with crappy site gags and over the top dialog that just annoy the viewer. And I mean everyone I let watch it. Save your money and buy a good comedy that you can laugh at cause this one ain't it. It's about a Z grade at best. I gave it one star because that was the lowest number I could set it to but it should be a minus 10 star movie
3,Busted,"Corey Haim is on the cover,but is only in the movie a very short time.The DVD transfer looked like it came from a VHS tape."
3,Busted is right!,"They sure picked a good title for this movie, the two Corey's were never going to win an oscar for their acting abilities but this one takes the cake, the plot is just as bad as the acting and there are alot of cliches but I will say for all the cheesy jokes it does have some entertaining quality (and I do mean some) Haim only has a few scenes whereas Feldman is the main character and lead actor, the reason for Haim having limited screen time was due to his alleged heavy drug use at the time of the movie's filming, if you are a fan of either Corey, you might get a laugh or two but don't expect much, their earlier films together (and seperate) are way more enjoyable."
3,Perch not good for large birds!,"I've had a few of these perches for the past 4 years or so, and sometimes my Umbrella Cockatoo does come crashing down perch and all. My poor husband is always trying to find ways to secure it to keep our bird safe. I'm certain other people have the same issue but like me haven't bothered to complain to the manufacturer."
3,shower perch,"I think this large shower perch is very well made but in no way would it stay up with only the suction cups. I ended up making a nice looking board, stained it and used contact cement to glue it onto the shower board in the shower, I then screwed in the suction cups so that it would stay up while Omar ( my parrot) takes his shower. It would be nice if there was an option to buy the extras I made for people to purchase for not everyone would have the tools needed to do this."
3,It's a great Idea,"I love the idea behind this, but this particular one seems very heavy. It does not stay attached to the wall very well."
1,Not Reliable,"Like other reviewers I am finding this perch to be highly unreliable for my bird, an African Gray. It scares my bird (and us) when he comes crashing down. I have tried to affix it to my kitchen window numerous times without any consistent success."
4,What is there to say?,"Other than the fact that both are excellent movies, of course. :o) I think any age would appreciate the films."
3,Películas que no pasan de moda,"When I found this product, I was very happy because I wanted to give my daughter because I always speak of the great films of my time, some of which now exist in another version.Is of good quality and design of the box is original because it has double safety.The part I dislike is when I realize that no audio or subtitles in Spanish, only brings in English and French."
4,Must watch even if it hurts...,"Well I had to see this 1983 flick again. It wasn't a favorite but its a classic. Nothing wrong with it I just am not a dancing Bacon fan. Now.... if he is playing an evil dude like in Hollowman or X-Men: First Class totally different response. I think he is great as a mad scientist or toying with world domination. He must have ""been there and done that, and got the T-shirt"" in a past life, hah! hah! But don't pass it up on my account because it is a good film or you could say 'period piece' depicting the early 80s.I picked this & the original 1985 ""Fright Night"" (great flick!) double paks up to review and share with my nieces before seeing the remakes.Fright Night / Urban Legend (Two-pack)"
5,Footloose/Flashdance Double Feature,"I purchased this double feature for my daughter who has never seen Footloose. The bonus was getting the Flashdance movie. They are both movies I loved as a teenager, and my daughter has watched Footloose at least 10 times already! The price for both was FANTASTIC, and delivery was less than a week!! Very happy with my purchase from Amazon.com and will continue to look for those good old movies that are too hard to find at a great price in stores!Sincerely,Kelly Monasmith"
5,Can't sit Still!,Great music...you can't sit still while any of it is playing. You will have to get up and dance around. Kevin Bacon was fabulous in this movie.
1,Footloose/Flashdance DVD,"Could not wait to watch this movie on Thanksgiving with my kids. Twenty minutes into Footloose it froze. We tried a few times to start over, but nothing worked. Was very disappointed. Is there any recourse??"
2,This doesn't go anywhere.,"While this album doesn't really have any ties to mainstream jazz at all, it also doesn't have any reason to make you enjoy listening to it either.Gary Hassay just plays through each song, never quite settling in on a melody, he does avoid the high-register squawks that you can sometimes associate with this genre. William Parker does his usuall superb job as a bassist, but there's nothing here about his playing that you can really hang your hat on.The medium-slow tempo of each song just makes the whole record feel drug out, and boring. I'm not quite sure why I've listened to it three or four times now. Now it's headed for the trash."
4,Action-packed adventure with lots of humour,"This movie was really a good surprise. Action-packed, easy to follow, this is really your Friday evening chillout movie. It was a pleasure to see Stallone come back with some high-profile names. The humour and self-satire makes the movie lighter and the violence more acceptable. Actors are well-directed and you end up the movie wanting to see more of it."
1,Awful,"One of the worst movies I have seen in the past few years. I like action flicks, from the Bourne series (Matt Damon version) to The Raid: Redemption, and many others. This was one of the absolute worst. Bad acting, lame directing, even the fighting scenes weren't interesting. I could find no redeeming qualities in this steaming pile of BS..."
1,Empty than a empty jar.,The ExpendablesWOW! Never thought a collection of 80s action stars will work in a mindless orgy of CGIs. So much unrealized potential. This could be an EPIC action movie apart from the lack of a credible plot or believable action sequence.
2,"I knew what I was getting, but still worse than that","I knew this movie would be no brain entertainment. But even knowing what it would be, it was worse than that. I can't believe I am seeing 3,4 and 5 star reviews here. If you can rent this for dirt cheap, I guess go ahead. But for me (big Stallone, Stathem fan) it was severly lacking in all areas - looked like it was their first movie acting ! And now I see EXP2 is coming out - no idea how in the world that happens - rather just see a Rambo 23."
2,Better off watching Rambo,"The main problem was that I saw Rambo with all that gore and carnage. The use of knives and the auto shotgun was great in this movie but Stallone really mellowed it out. Both movies involves mercenaries, explosives, foreign dictators with a small army, a daring escape and rescue, a hottie, but Rambo just does it better.Their individual movies were better. Dolph Lundgren in the Punisher, Statham in Death Race, Jet Li in Kiss of the Dragon, etc."
3,"the problem is the last ""rambo"" and ""rocky"" were great",the last rambo and rocky along with the original rocky were 3 of the best films with stallone.... this expendables was not even close... and maybe that isnt a fair comparison... compared to other grade b movies this one would be great but as a hollywood production with big names it totally misses.... and the goodguy/badguy/goodguy of dolf lundgren's character made no sense... buy it used on dvd cheap and it would compare with undisputed 2...
3,The Expendables,"I really like this movie, lots of good visual efects and all acttion movie fan will not be without this one.Seweral of the greatest action heavywhight stars are in this even tho some of them geting a bit old xDThe Blueray disc did not work for me ( I get an error saying something about wrong zone) even tho I use Cyberlink PowerDvD 10 Mark II wich as far as I know is zone free?"
2,"lotta action, little story","I was ready to love this movie - and yes, I know it is an action movie. Crank was an action movie but the chase, fight, leap, run scenes were interesting and well choreographed. AND it had some story. This movie was like a constant tumble down a hill."
3,"Good Action, But Not Much Else","The Expendables has some of my favorite action stars together in one movie. I mean, there's one scene where Sylvester Stallone, Arnold, and Bruce Willis on screen together and it was just exciting to see. And there is a lot of action in this one, but it really isn't anything we haven't seen before. It's basically Rambo all over again, only with a far better cast. The first hour has way too much dialogue, which wouldn't be a problem if it were really good dialogue. But it isn't. And that's what made 80's action movies like Lethal Weapon, Commando, and Predator so great. Not only did they deliver the action-packed goods, but they also had good, interesting, often funny dialogue.The Expendables is worth seeing. Just don't expect the next action classic. I did, and I was a little disappointed."
3,"Not too shabby. Corpus Christi, Tx","I went to see this movie cause Stallone said it didn't have any computer generated wizardry. It was OK. I managed to sit through the whole movie. Unlike the A Team, where I walked out within the 1st 15 mins. Except for the last song, the sound tract sucks! It just didn't sound right. Not like Jackie Brown or Pulp Fiction. Now those sound tracks are worth buying, and how!!!P.S. I so wanted to shout out, ""The terminator can't even govern, much less be president!"""
2,"Great action, cookie-cutter plot and characters","It may be a star-studded, testosterone laden action movie with lots of violence and explosions, but I think it really comes down to being just a boilerplate, cookie cutter film. I enjoyed the action but didn't really find myself with much investment in the characters or the plot."
2,"The elite playing ""expendables""","2 stars for a determined Stallone suffering a brokenneck during filming.The cast, which look like a football team's 50 yearreunion (minus Li), are juiced-up and ready to deliverthis Summer's most overblown, testosterone-ladendissapointment.Barney (Stallone... not Bush's dog) reteams with PlanetHollywood to recieve his next assignment: surprisinglyenough, a mission to take down a commie drug czar in thefictional country of Vilena! Inside jokes awkwardly ensueamid the church.The pacing becomes rapid during the film's orgy of bloodshedwhich nearly rivals Rambo: massive explosions; countlessbullets shredding bodies like so much cheese; shattered bones,bruised flesh and dislocated joints from a plethora of kicksand punches; unofficial UFC mathes; and CGI blood spurtingfrom each scene to the next in a fashion that Stallone excelsat. However, this was not enough to save The Expendables fromits mostly forgettable moments."
2,Expendables is expendable,"All I can say is explosions gets 1 star, special guns 1 star, the rest loses. Horrible acting and horrible plot. Can't get that 2 hours of my life back unfortunately."
2,Pretty Silly,"Only download this movie if you run out of Law & Order reruns, which is probably not going to happen. This movie is truly ""Expendable""."
2,The Expendables,It has unnecessay violence and bloodshed.Stallone et al clinging to a film genre whose time has past.Attempts at humor lost.
5,Great Movie,I lost my original The Expendables movie but the combo pack made up for it since it plays on different venues.
4,Lot's of action,"action threw out the whole flick, it was fun to watch. i like the flim so... thats, that. see for yourself."
3,Action was good....character development minimal.,The movie was violent as expected...no disappointment for action. A little slow in some parts due to minimal plot. Overall a good watch.
3,I got a little bored,"Typical Stallone film. Stathom was great but I could have re-cast everyone else. Good fight scenes, just not great acting."
3,Good Movie if your interested in lots of violence and thin plots,"Okay if your looking for lots of blood and gore, light on acting. Plot is plausable lots of action no boring points in the film"
3,If you like violence,This is one of the most violent movies I have seen in a while.I could compare it to Aliens vs. Predators!!I recommend for only mature audience
1,all over the place,Just thought it was stupid didn't like at all. Bunch of old men trying to be tough guys. no good
5,great movie,what can I say awesome movie...lotsa good actors in it .I liked everything about this movie.....only that Steve Austin should have been on the other side......
2,"If you loved ""The A Team""...","If you loved ""The A Team"", you'll love this movie. Cartoon like characters, dialogue straight out of ""He Man"", zillions of rounds fired with the good guys relatively unscathed and girls who dig it when a fella can put the smack down on a small gang made me look for B.A. or Face to show up in the black van.The plot was of course ridiculous. When first you, like me, find yourself saying ""wait, that can't happen ..."", understand this will occur to you untold more times and let it go man, just let it go.The 40 to 65 year old characters' personalities and actions would embarrass any self respecting pubescent teen. ""Granddad why are you getting a skull tattoo""?As a complete movie ""The Expendables"" is sub par, 2 stars at best.To be fair, if the plot, characters, dialogue and believability are not important to you, and your demands are impervious heroes full of machismo ducking thousands of rounds while things go boom, this may just be your kind of film."
3,"ok movie, too much talking and not enough action","The plot wasn't flimsy and drawn out. I was surprised by the lack of action throughout the whole movie, it left me wanting more."
2,Digital Copy is EXPIRED,"While I must compliment Amazon on their fast shipping this time around (I ordered it on Monday, chose free shipping, and it arrived on Wednesday!), I am very disappointed in the fact that the digital copy of this movie is EXPIRED and WILL NOT TRANSFER. It is one of the selling points of this particular product, seeing as it is even called out IN THE TITLE, so I find it ridiculous that it does not work. This is NOT a 3 disc set seeing as the 3rd disc is completely dead. If you buy this product NEW, then the digital copy should work. I find it upsetting that the digital copy expired a YEAR ago, and from what I can tell, there is nothing that can be done to remedy this. NOT COOL.In other news, the DVD itself seems to work fine. Haven't been able to test out the Blu-ray disc yet."
2,"Awful, just awful...","The first half of the movie attempt to create some believable story, while the latter end comes close to giving you epileptic seizures with its mind-dumbing action. A few action sequences are well done, and a few random one-liners will make you chuckle, but that's all there is to this movie--just a time filler."
3,eh..,Good thing this was free when i watched it because I would not pay to see this. There is a reason why stallone doesnt makes movies. The plot sucked and the acting was mediocre. I did enjoy the fight scenes but the was overall was pretty stupid
4,One of Stallone's best.,"Originally bought movie because Jason Stathem is in it, but was pleasantly surprised at how good it is. Really good paced action movie that keeps your attention. Stallone has outdone himself all the way around. I'd reccommend it to anyone."
4,Lots of action,Great movie with lots of action scenes. Great guy movie with all the best action stars in it!! Bought for my dad for christmas. My husband and him both loved it!!
5,Good Movie,"This movie was just an awsome movie to see. It had a good story it has a lot of action and a lot of shooting and blowing stuff up. Stallone did an excellent job writting, directing, and acting in this movie."
4,Old School Rock & Roll Action,"This is a fun movie, a rollicking good action film with most of the action stars from the 1980's and 1990's involved. There are also a couple of the new action stars, like Stratham and Terry Crews. Toss in a couple of MMA types, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren and....wow! The story is fun and the action is great. There's very little CGI used, so the stunts look real and feel real. Because they ARE real. So real that Sly Stallone had his neck broken in one of the fight scenes. This is no joke, he now has three metal screws permanenetly embedded in his neck.The reviews were pretty good, but they complained about a ""love interest"". Obviously those reviewers did not pay attention to the dialog. Yes, there is dialog in the movie, and some of it is quite a lot of fun! Sly's character starts off the show with a weary soul, and he sees a way of redeeming himself, just a bit, by eventually agreeing to help ""the girl that refuses to run"".A good story, and a GREAT action flick! Enjoy!"
4,"""Not Bad!""","Sylvester Stallone directs and stars in this2010 action film co-starring Jason Statham,Jet Li and more. A team of Mercenaries arehired to save a South American island froma ruthless dictator. This isn't bad and Slyis great as usual. This dvd has nice pictureand sound plus some neat extras. Get this."
2,Old plot + The action scenes could not exploit the skills of the stars,"- The action scenes could not exploit the skills of the stars. For example the fighting between Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren was a big disappointment. It's too dark. I could hardly see anything.- The plot has been repeated multiple times before.- In short, it's a waste of all the talents of all the stars such as Stallone, Jet Li, and Dolph Lundgren, Jason Statham"
2,Very Expendable,"OK, I will admit it is cute to see all these past their prime, except Mickey Rourke, actors trying to have that one last fun in the sun round up. But all in all this is a terrible flick with bad acting, worse dialogue and violence that would make Bugs Bunny roll his eyes. I enjoy turning my brain off sometimes for something silly and stupid but this goes beyond the pale even for that.Long story short there are much better, dumb action movies out there than this one. Don't waste your time or your money!"
1,Save your money and time,"It just so happens that I was able to see this film for free because Korean airlines has a lot of free films. And boy, am I glad that I didn't pay for this.The movie was silly and had no plot. End of story."
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"THis movie is so bad, and not in good bad way. Hey I have a soft spot for a well done bad movie. This is just painful. This is so bad even the sound track is bad. The acting is horrible, these guys can do better, they just didn't. The screen play is bad and the dialouge is so bad it should be outlawed as torture by Amnesty International.Just please watch paint dry for a couple of hours, it will be time better spent."
1,disappointed,"I eagerly anticipated seeing this movie and must admit that my initial was ""wow"". Wow, how could a movie actually be this bad?Surprised? Maybe I should confess that I can't honestly say that I actually ""saw"" this movie. This was because the entire film seemed to have been camoflauged by darkness! Sly, Invest in lighting! Action scenes were night scenes! Day scenes were mostly shot in dimly lit bars. It makes a viewer wonder, ""what is it that they don't want me to see""? Poor acting and a bad script don't change due to the absence of light. Boring dialogue was consistant in that it was boring at the beginning, at the end and throughout the middle of this cenematic disaster. Characters appeared to be taken straight from a comic book.I would like to add that this movie did have one redeeming factor. If I find that factor, I will add it to this review. Pass on this one!"
1,What A Waste of Time!,"If you should actually watch this turkey, make sure you first ""park your brain at the door"". During the course of this movie I kept saying to myself: ""I can't believe I'm still watching this cr*p."" What a turkey!"
1,One of the worst of all time.,I understand that this movie isn't supposed to be very serious but I would still rank this as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I'm would be pissed if I had to pay anything more than 99 cents for this horrible movie picture.
1,Just awful...,Real horrible movie... top ten worst of the year. But what else would u expect from this brainless porn actor???
1,A COMPLETE WASTE,"I like a good (key word) action / adventure as much as the next guy, especially anything with Bruce Willis, Jason Statham or Jet Li, and it's always nice to see Mickey Rourke, but this was just a waste. Maybe I'm just pissed that they wasted so many opportunities for humor, but then Stallone always has taken himself too seriously."
1,A serious waste of time,"They really didn't have to do much to make this movie entertaining, but they used Jet Li completely wrong. It was awkward and made the movie painful to watch. I recommend that you do not even be curious about this movie. Just avoid it."
3,It's alright not great,"There is not much real acting in this as it is basically a shoot-em up movie. A bit over the top with the graphic violence parts, I think, and the plot line old and quite shallow. Won't watch it again."
4,Better Than Expected,"A must see action flix, even the stars are good so watch this and enjoy the movie. You will like it"
3,Not a bad action show,"Lots of action , so so acting as usual in a show like this , not serious but entertaining.This show was worth watching."
3,Much explosions,"It is very cool to see all these past (and some current) action stars taking out all the bad guys. The violence is basically what you'd expect (much gun play, explosions, etc.) and although they could have gone over the top with slo mo damage, but some of the back-lit blood & knife throws were a bit much for me."
3,Stallone the hypocrite,"I'll make this one quick. Granted, you don't watch a flick like this for great dialogue or inspired acting. Those of us who believe in the whole good vs. evil/ elite small group triumphs against overwhelming odds paradigm, enjoy these shoot 'em ups, and cool martial arts choreography is a plus. This movie has a good bit of all that, and I would have given it four stars except that Stallone has made ten fortunes on exactly that paradigm, but now he's come out as an anti-Second Amendment typical Hollyweird lefty. I'll never pay to see anything he's connected with again."
3,"Cool movie, bad streaming quality.","This movie is way cool, however Amazon should invest more in streaming quality. Even for a non-HD movie the picture quality and resolution was far from been acceptable (a DVD has much more quality then Amazon's streaming). Also, Amazon's web media player is never able to fill my widescreen TV (there are always black edges on both right and left sides of the screen)."
4,good movie,"good action, the second is better. stallone does a good job as the 'leader of the pack'. I'd watch the second too."
3,"Good Blow'em Up, Shoot, Knife and Beatup Flick","It was cool, but really a lot of bullets, knives and fists. Truck sounds cool. Big cast for this movie... and thought it would be better. I wouldn't watch it twice, but will check out E2."
2,Not what was advertised,"I ordered this used product based on the cost and description. When the product arrived, I discovered that the plastic case was broken (not that big a deal). More importantly, however, it only had the Blu-Ray disc in it (even though the paper insert clearly mentioned a total of 3 discs (2 DVD/1 BR). It has obvously been repackaged since there was only a spot for one disc... Very disappointed."
3,So So,"There's a whole lot of action but a very weak plot. After seeing it once, I won't watch it again."
2,Bad movie,"waste of time. Stallone looks like a smashed bag of onions. I have tried to finish this movie twice and have fallen asleep both times. Again, Stallone looks like a smashed bag of onions."
5,BEST ACTION MOVIE OF 2010!,"THIS IS A EXCELLENT MOVIE, THANK YOU SLY FOR GIVING US A GREAT FILM TO WATCH, I WOULD HAVE GIVING IT 10 STARS IF I COULD. STALLONE IS THE BEST."
3,Expended more like it ...,"I watched the first half of this movie before the Steelers / Jets game.I stopped at the wharf scene.I'm thinking ... WOW, can't wait to get back to this!What a dud!The second half was lame.How?Stallone looked like a mummy whom had a bad body lift with loose 1"" veins protuding.Women are supposed to like this > GROSS!Jet Li was made to be a whimp.Considering his prowess, this was an insult.The scenes were so staged as to be boring.The movie was so cliched I was groaning, & I like action movies.PROsthe flying weapon icon was coolthe making of was far more entertainingThe movie would have been far better if there was a plot, dimension to one sided characters, some actually thought about entertainment, an interesting story et cetera ...I would have had far more respect if the movie had character like the making of segment.Overall rating ...2 GUNS DOWN"
1,"""Great Actors""","I do not get why Stallone is the lead for one thing, he is probably the worst actor of the group, but then it is a bad movie so placing him as the lead was a good choice I guess.Do not waste your time."
1,viewer beware,"I think this movie may have given me AIDS. It may have deserved a second star if Stallone had managed to keep his shirt on, but that hope only lasted about 15 minutes. I think the least believable part was being asked as an audience to believe that Randy Couture knows how to read."
1,Crap,"Leftover crap from the 80's. I loved the action movies of Arnold and Bruce Willis from the 80's. In this flick, Stallone is so pumped full of botox that his face doesn't even move. Please go elsewhere for mindless entertainment!"
2,Non-challenging....if that's what you're looking for....,"I went to see ""The Expendables"" with my son in the theatre. It's exactly what you'd expect. If you're old enough, you go to see how time had treated these action heros. You can call it a feel-good movie; you feel better about having lasted long enough to see these guys in action again. If you're young enough, you might be able to tolerate the re-cycled dialog.Except for two minutes of genuine acting by Mickey Rourke about 2/3 through the picture, you are safe from needing any kind of critical thinking skills. If this is what you're searching for....enjoy if for what it is; mindless, violent escapist fare."
1,you will waste your money,I got this movie because I really enjoyed the last Stallone's movie: RAMBO 4.I expected even more in this one. It is a shame. I paid $19.99 and this movie worth 3 cents S&H; incluided. Many parts in the movie are out of focus and dialogues plenty of stupid humor or humor without ingenious. It is incredible how Mr Stallone becomes in garbage a sky plenty of stars.
1,dark and dreary,this was one of the worst - We love action films and love the cast but the filming was dark and the music was too loud drowning out the dialogue - glad I only spent a $1 at Block Buster kiosk......
2,ok,"like van Damme said it was all about the money, i am so glad the actors like chuck Norris and van Damme did not take any apart of this sell out movie, what can i say about Sylvester Stallone. like he said it was all about the money. that shows people van damme is not that bad. He did not want any part of this movie like he said the plot was weak and it was not about the money to him."
1,If you dont mind bad acting and a horrible story then its awesome...,This is by far the worst mainstream movie of 2010... I could not even sit through all of it..... The acting is painful at best.... and the story got stuck in the 1980's somewhere.... maybe that is what they were going for but I have to ask myself WHY? There will always be a few that rave about movies like this but not me....
4,Slight Let Down,"I was expecting more, given the super cast and Sly's recent string of awesome hits in which he directed, including Rambo and Rocky Balboa. The dialogue, especially in the beginning, seemed really forced. It starts to work itself out towards the middle, but still nothing compared to what it could have been. The awesome action saves the movie. This cast, this director, in this era of filmmaking could have been one of the coolest ever."
4,Good Movie,"Another predictable movie from hollywood. Fun, cool stuff happening all the time and with the greatest cast comprised of every action star possible how could you not like it. 1 or 2 times watched but hey if friends come over that have not seen it and they want to watch it then it might see the light of day again."
4,Movie review,My husband and I enjoyed this movie when we saw it in the theater and for that reason we purchased it. It was difinetly worth purchasing.
2,Another Blu Ray That wont Play,Even with an OS upgrade this blu ray wont play on my panasonic blu ray machine.These studios keep tinkering with the format and you never know what will play or not.Only the sony ps3 is updated enough to keep up. Other machjines watch out! This gets old.
2,"Even action scenes could not save this ""movie""","Each star from ""Expendables"" alone in any other movie worked just fine. But bring them all together on a screen and it's a disaster waiting to happen.In fact, only one decent performance really stood out... by Jason Statham. The rest were just filling in the gaps (even Stallone). I have no idea what was the point of having Dolph Lundgren (Drago from Rocky IV) in this movie and the movie itself was quiet chaotic. Stallone should have used more money on the screenwriter and drop some of the cast (like Bruce Willis, Arnold you-know-who, Mickey Rourke, Dolph Lundgren). Jet Li did not fit into the cast at all, IMHO.But I think Sean Connery probably feels left out. Wesley Snipes could have used extra money right now. Hell, Chuck Norris could have used a break from the ""Total Gym"" infomercials.Overall, there was absolutely no depth to any of the characters with a very ""safe"" story line."
2,Two stars,"Gathering a bunch of 80s action stars into one movie was a great idea but it's a shame it was wasted on such a terrible script.I think the dialog was supposed to be quick and witty but instead it was incoherent, silly, and predictable.The plot was ""bad guy does bad things and good guys kill him with a lot of explosions"". That would have been great if this were a parody of 80s action movies but it isn't.No character development at all. Characters are ""fast little guy"", ""knife guy"", ""deep thinker leader guy"", ""big dumb guy"", ""big dude with big gun guy"" and ""sexy woman (who isn't sexy in this case) needing saving"".The only good acting was by Rourke.Most of the action was dull.If you just want to see some fire and blood then this is a fine choice. If you'd like something more then look elsewhere."
2,Bad video quality - Blu-ray in Brasil ...,"The Expendables has a bad plot, bad actors, bad dialogues ... weak movie. Highdef Digest gave four star for video quality. I just can say that they saw a different Blu-ray that I rented here in Brasil. And here the sound was Dolby Digital. What are they doing with the Blu-ray? Liongates, can you say something ???"
1,"Like the ""Not for Women"" commercial","This movie was ridiculous. It was like the Dr. Pepper 10 commercial (where the guys are riding through the jungle in a jeep blowing stuff up) for an hour and 40 minutes. I'll admit, it was nostalgic to see all of the old action heros together, but the plot and storyline were both predictable and stupid. I love action movies, but this one was just stupid. You can blow up an entire island as long as you save one barefoot latina? And the General's spanish accent was pretty bad, too. Like worse than J.Lo speaking Spanish. Glad I didn't pay for this one."
3,Dialogue Unforgiveable,"There's great action and big explosions and it was great to see so many action heroes in one film, but the dialogue was so poorly written and distracting that it really bummed me out. To be clear, I didn't have high hopes at all and my expectations are very low in terms of story, acting, and dialog in films like these, but I found the dialog so poor that it was difficult for me to concentrate on the cool visuals in the film. This is a blu-ray that I really regret purchasing for my collection; I should have rented it first."
3,"So bad, but so funny","This is not a great film with great acting.However, because of that (or maybe in spite of), it's enjoyable.Just don't expect too much.The cameos are great - The Governator looks a bit peakish."
3,Not very good but it's got Jet Li,"... oh, and that delicious Dolph Lundgren. I'm one of those weird females that likes violent movies and with this cast, I was pretty hopeful but the plot is tired and dull. It was still fun seeing my favorite 80s action stars here, though... although I missed seeing Carl Weathers.Any True Blood fans reading this? I pictured Eric being more like a young Dolph Lundgreen than that reedy kid they chose."
2,Very Let Down,"I was very excited when I first heard about this movie, I am a huge action buff and was giddy about seeing all these great action legends together. The action scenes were really good and really well done, the reason I gave it two stars was because the dialogue between the actors was HORRIBLE, and I mean bad, so bad that my girlfriend and I kept looking at each other in disbelief that this movie was so highly rated, usually in action movies I can easily overlook acting and dialogue, because the action is what everyone wants to see, but not in this case...it was painful to sit through, especially Dolph Lungren, apparantly he is much better in roles where he doesn't speak...at all... the lines were really ridiculous, hey theirs no doubt that Stallone can make action movies, no doubt, but i'm thinking he needs someone else to write the dialogue with his scripts, because this could have been one of the greatest action movies ever made....but it's not, by a longshot"
1,About what you'd expect,"Imagine every bad scene in each of these actors' careers, all rolled into one movie. Yeah, it's just that good!"
4,Just plain fun,"this is not an award winning movie, it is just fun and the guys had fun making light of themselves."
5,Awesome,Loved this movie my father is into action and this was his christmas gift. This price was amazing for a movie...
3,movie,"not a type of movie I was looking for, I wanted Expendables II and was sent the wrong one for some idiot reason"
4,all my heroes,"amaing cast all in one place even if only for some breif appearancesa number of funny one liners, pretty basic macho guy stupid humor but hey this is exactly what I expected from this crew and of course i love itgood explosions and visuals"
4,complete showing of who is who in action films,"great action film, many leading actors portrayed in roles that are not the usual for them. enjoyed it very much"
2,Mediocrity Festival,"I was prepared for this to be terrible, but I wasn't prepared for it to be as boring as it is. The film is just not interesting in any way. The characters are not engaged in the action, so there's no reason for the audience to get engaged.It's just so boring listening to these over the hill nimrods acting badly and delivering their lines poorly. Your time would be better spent watching their other, older movies. Those movies might be campy and dated, but at least they're trying. They're just phoning it in for The Expendables."
5,OMG!,"I LOVED this movie. I watched Rocky, Die Hard, Rambo when I was in high school. Jet Li and Jason Statham are favorites. Overall, better than what I ever expected!! Can't wait to watch Expendables 2."
3,I fell asleep,Pretty good movie. I fell asleep though so either I was real tired or it wasn't that good.I was going to actually rent the movie until I found out it was free with Prime! :)
4,All action....,Great Action Movie!!! This is the third time watching this movie in 2 years. Still love the none stop storyline...
4,Get to the Choppas!,"This one is a must-have for action movie fans just for the mega-action starpower lineup alone. The storyline was pretty much your typical standard action movie fare, which means that it barely had much of a plot and was nothing that you haven't already seen told a million times before, but that's all that it really needed to be. The action is what counts most and it was through-the-roof, and that's what these kinds of movies are really all about anyways. Just to see all of these big-name action movie stars together on the screen all at the same time was definitely worth it and I look forward to seeing the next chapter in the series."
2,Right up there with Commando,"Had hopes given the cast. Sadly, Arnold only had a cameo. Wow is Dolf awful or what. The movie did set a record for cheesy looking blood splatters. We started playing a version of ""Bob' ...."
5,GREAT!,I just love all these actors. being in the same movie is a big plus and i will be watching for more
1,DO NOT BUY,"Wow, what a horrible movie..........yeah I liked most of the actors in this movie but together they are horrible. I enjoyed all of these actors growing up but something happened when they put all of them in the same movie. I do not know how better else to describe this movie...........when it ended I just blinked and thought of what else I could have been doing."
1,2 expendable hours,A truly low point for Stallone and the rest of the cast. An absolute waste of time and money. You'd get more satisfaction watching paint dry. Skip it.
1,Definitely expendable,Only view this movie if you don't need to buy it. The most unbelievable part of the movie is at the time I wrote this over 80 people had given it 5 stars. The use of Bruce and Arnold was a total come on and served only to devalue the movie. I wish I had borrowed this from a library instead of paying for it. This movie was definitely expendable.
1,"ugh, crap","Well, it was different I'll give 'em that much. But this was really crappy and boooorrrrrring. I don't even know where to begin. I don't even really want to spend much time thinking about my rant...that's how bad this was. In short, they're a bunch of mercenaries. No military tie-in's or history or depth at all to the characters. Just a bunch of paid mercenaries that blow a lot of stuff up. I suppose if you have absolutely nothing better to do and have time to kill and don't care about anything but watching a bunch of explosions with no plot...then OK by all means rent this. It may help to be drinking or high, of which I was neither."
1,Horrible,Read all the other 1 star reviews. They've covered everything that was so very wrong with this movie. I am so grateful that I only paid $6 to see it at a matinée.
4,Great Throwback Action Film,"If you like old school Action movies with lots of things that go boom, This is the one for you! Story is irrelevant. Just good old brute action. Great popcorn movie!"
3,Not up to the hype...,"The Expendables definitely didn't live up to all the hype. I will say it is a striaght-up, pure action flick. I expected to see something at least close to the latest Rambo or even Rocky Balboa, seeing that Stallone also wrote this one; but the story was incredibly weak.Pros:- decent action flick- great cast- explosions galoreCons:- storyline- acting- unrealisticThe pros are self explanitory; great action, cast and explosions. The cons tho; I mean Stalone can write and has written a number of great screenplays. This one...not so much. The acting was rediculous; Stallone and Statham were good, but you can't really understand Lundgren's lines; Li, Crewes, and Austin can't act in the first place and Rourke, Arnold and Willis were all cameos.I'm not saying this was a bad movie; which is why it got 3 stars...but I would recommend as a rental since I have no motivation to watch this one again."
2,I'm surprised it got all the good press,"With all the good press and hype this movie got I was was pretty stoked on seeing it. But wow I kind of walked away scratching my head thinking this wasn't that great of a movie. At some points in the movie your wondering if the actors ever said you really want me to say this? Cause you can't help but roll your eyes at what is being said or shift in your seat cause it's that painful. The action is alright, some really over the top gore to it. All in all I would skip this one, I don't even think it would of helped it if it was released in the 80s."
3,Average but Boring,If not for the abundant star power in this movie it would be a total clunker. There is next to nothing of a story and the entire movie consists of how well something gets either shot up or blown up. I'm really glad that I waited to see this through my NetFlix account as if I actually paid a big first run ticket price I would have been really mad.
3,OK,Bought for husband who was a little disappointed in it. He wanted to see it before going to see the second version that was coming out at the movies. He said he's glad he didn't pay to see it at the movies.
5,Not Expendables II,"I expected it to be more like the second movie and it was't. After that it was a good movie. It has humor, it has stars, and it has a lot of action with more than one storyline going at one time. It also has, don't tell anybody this, emotions, not just from Charisma Carpenter's character. I am glad I bought it."
4,"Spectacular movie, all star cast","This movie was action packed and had a great story line. I enjoyed every minute of it. Stallone, Li and Statham were awesome. I would watch it again."
3,Exactly what you would think,"Any new Stallone movie where he plays a mercenary is going to be a bit silly. Add Dolph Lundgren and it gets ridiculous. Exactly what you need to waste time on an airplane. I will be watching ""The Expendables II"""
2,Continuous action yet boring,"As much as I am a fun of action movies, this one was rather boring and predictable. Please some plot is required. Yes, sure there was one but it was completely lame as well as the total invincibility projected sucked out all of the potential suspense."
2,Love the movie - not happy with DTS-only soundtrack,"I don't have the best sound system, but it does have Dolby Digital but not DTS. Therefore, I cannot watch this movie in surround sound. I either have to watch it in French or listen to the commentary if I want any sound through my sound system. Otherwise, I'm stuck listening to the movie via the TV speakers (yuck) or I have to get the standard def DVD out to listen to it in 5.1.Not sure why they did this. I mean, come on. It IS Blu-Ray and you have 50 gbs of space on a dual-layer, so I cannot see it's because they were strapped for space. I love the movie, but the release on Blu-Ray is not very desirable. I may be in the minority of those that don't have DTS decoders, but come on! All the other movies I've gotten on Blu-Ray all have at least a 5.1 if not a 2.0 Dolby soundtrack.The movie gets at least four stars, but this release on Blu-Ray gets a 2 star for me."
2,Good copy but not all of it showed up!,I received the Blu-ray copy but did not receive the other two disc. The Blu-ray copy did work great and was like brand new.
3,expendables,"didn't rate the sales hype from the movie maker it was alright, but.....hopefully they will keep trying to improve the subject matter"
3,It is what it is,"The loudest, dumbest, macho-est, shooting-est action film ever? Well, obviously there's a lot of competition, but this one's sure a contender. Sylvester Stallone leads this testosterone-heavy cast... He's getting a bit old and lumbering for this stuff, but he's still having fun. Nice cameo by Arnold, too. This flick is silly and stupid, but it doesn't pretend for a moment to be anything else: you get exactly what you'd expect... and more! (Axton)"
1,movie is horrible and copyrights holders will SUE YOU,"1. The movie Expendables, was lame.2. The Copryright holders of this movie, went on a suing spree, they extorted/blackmailed $3,000-4,000 from ~20,000+ ""illegal pirates.""3. You can verify #2 with a simple google search..something like.. ""expendables lawsuits torrents.""4. Innocent people get sued constantly, much easier to do than 1 would think."
1,Expendables DVD,The DVD never worked. I sent in a request for them to send a new one and never heard back.
2,So very bad,"I had higher hopes since I really enjoyed ""Red"" with Bruce Willis, which has a similar sort of older action hero back in action kind of story. There is no comparison. I suspect the writing was done by a 12 year old boy. It's predictable, and cliche, and lame, and sometimes cringe-worthy. I just cringed while thinking about it. Most of the action sequences are too choppy and hard to follow. There were a few exciting action bits. If there was a bright spot, it was Jason Statham. I didn't even know who he was before I watched this film. His fight scenes were probably the most entertaining and well done. I was originally drawn in by the ""old school"" cast and really wanted to like it, but it is so very bad."
4,They Are Not Expendable,"I find it helpful to be able to access movies without having to wait for them to be presented by my On Demand provider. Accessing the movie was easy and fast, and the cost was reasonable."
3,Not Segal,"We are Segal fans, so found that the humor was put on. But, that is Stallone. Alot of action in the end, worth waiting for."
3,"Movie is ok, but used disc was bad...","Disc had a scratch and will not play all the way thru... fizzles and dies after scene 10. The movie is ok, probably wouldn't buy again though. Also, think I'm finished buying used."
3,No Diamond Eyes in the movie!,Great action movie but it did not include Diamond Eyes by Shinedown in the soundtrack. I was really looking forward to seeing/hearing that.daffyb55
5,Balls to the Wall!!!,"This was one badass, hold on to the edge of your seat action movie. Plenty of gun fire, fights, and explosions even for the most die hard action fans, and the cast definitely doesnt let you down. From Rambo to the Terminator and from The Texas Rattle Snake to The Punisher, just about every great action hero is stuffed in here and wrapped with a bow, just ticking to explode. This is a must see! P.S. If your fav action hero is missing check out number two, everyone they seemed to miss in 1 they got for 2."
5,Extened Cut is a must for any movie lover,Thie special edition is a must for any movie lover. We loved all the extras and seeing all the actors making the movie. 2 Thumbs up!
4,Exactly What I Expected,"Full of action galore.It's not going to win any Oscars or any awards,but you knew that going in.Led by Sly Stallone with a bunch of past and present action stars.Pretty much Stallone,Jet LI and Jason Statham carry the movie along with such other greats in a lesser role. Bruce Willis,Eric Roberts,Mickey Rourke,Arnold S with even a 2 minute or so appearance,Dolph Lundgren,among others are there to for support.A fun movie that will have your heart racing,with some nasty bodies exploding and guts pouring.Not too graphic as his most recent Rambo,but lots of fun.So if you are into Stallone and his action style,you should enjoy this one highly.It is around 1 hr. and 35 minutes.Just the right time for this type of film.Expect a second installment of Expendables to start shooting in June.I'm sure it will be just as intense.So what are you waiting for??? Grab a seat,some popcorn and sit back for action-packed fun."
5,EXPENDABLES=EXCELLENT MOVIE,"This is by far one of the better movies that was made in this era. If you love action this movie is for you. Also has all the great actors in it: Stallone, Statham, Rourke."
3,Okay action movie - could have been much better!,"Given the big name stars in this movie, I was a little disappointed with the movie. Individually, the stars of this movie have done better movies. I would reccomend the movies Taken and Shoot'Em Up as action movies that are better than The Expendables."
5,Action movie,This is great all the action players together. You need to see this and I will get Expendables 2. GREAT
4,Love!,One of those silly movies for a person who loves action movies with their favorite actor or actress. Had no problems arriving on time always great service!
4,Good movie of old action veterans,"Very intense and action filled....a great cast of old movie veterans. If you like action this movie is for you, with a followup to Expendables 2."
5,Great!,A very action packed movie..would recommend to anyone that loves action movies..this movie definitely takes the cake=action every 2 seconds!
4,Movie was good,The movie was very action packed! A lot of fighting. Not good for young children due to bloody fighting. Good movie though!
4,Pretty Good Movie,Stallone still has it with the idea of this story and eventually he will become lengedary for this type of film category!!!
2,Great movie! Shame about BluRay region issues.,"I've seen this at the movies and love it, thought I'd buy it on BluRay with Expendables 2.There starts the issues. DVD running fine, but the BluRay is region locked for some reason, the first time I've ever seen this. Of all my BluRay from Amazon only these two movies have a region lock.WARNING:So please confirm you have the correct player for the BluRay disc if you're not from USA. It appears only to be this series of movies from this manufactor."
2,language and over the top violence,"I enjoy occasionally watching action films, however, the language wasn't necessary nor the showing of body parts exploding with blood spraying everywhere. This was not a movie I would pay to see or recommend."
3,A fun romp where the old guys get another day in the sun,"I didn't expect too much and this movie delivered. It was fun to watch and held my attention. It didn't have me thinking about it until Amazon prompted me to review it. I don't think I'll want to go back and see it again. Not deep, A few good action scenes. Lots of ""I wonder what happened to them"" actors. It's good for what it is."
1,BLUE RAY DOESN'T WORK!!!,"I GOT THIS MOVIE FOR MY FATHER FOR CHRISTMAS, AND HE JUST OPENED IT TONIGHT AND THE BLUE RAY DOESN'T WORK!!! IT GIVES SOMEKIND OF ERROR AND SAYS IT CANNOT READ IT! THE REGULAR DVD AND DIGITAL COPY WORK FINE BUT THE BLUE RAY, WHICH IS WHY WE BOUGHT IT, DOESN'T WORK AT ALL! THERE IS A SMALL CRACK IN THE CENTER OF THE BLUE RAY AND THE DISC ITSELF JUST LOOKS MESSED UP COMPARED TO OTHER BLUE RAYS HE OWNS SO I DONT KNOW BUT IT WAS NOT SOMETHING WE DID, AND NOW BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN PAST 30 SINCE IT WAS ORDERED WE CAN ONLY GET A PARTIAL REFUND AND HAVE TO PAY FOR THE RETURN SHIPPING AND EVERYTHING. DONT KNOW IF I WILL BE ORDERING ANY MORE MOVIES ANY TIME SOON!!!"
2,Where the old actors go to die,"Same old same ole. Nothing original here, watching the old stars move around was painful. If you want a blast from the past, ie. first blood, etc. only with senior citizens you will love this one."
2,Hard to watch,"The Expendables is really not worth watching, despite the fact I paid 99 cents.Calculate the value of 2 hours of your time. If > 99 cents then skip this one."
1,Expendables - bad is way up!,"This is seriously bad. No plot. Bad guys who don't seem to actually have a plan or seem to have done anything bad except push around a few natives. Heroes so filled with botox they have no facial expressions whatsoever. The worst script and even worse acting. I think Lundgren only worked out ok in Rocky IV because he spoke very little. He speaks way too much here. Why put in the Charisma Carpenter character for 2 scenes that have nothing to do with anything else in the movie? You know the saying ""so bad it's good""? It does not apply here - it's so bad it's really bad."
1,Just... No.,"I got this movie through Netflix, thinking it was just going to be some good, mindless violence. It was mindless alright, but not in the way that I was expecting! The action scenes were silly; it was terribly written (very choppy) and did not draw me in at all."
1,The Expendables,"Given the cast, I expected this movie to be cheesy. It exceeded my expectations. If there were a Sanford Simpson scale of suckiness ""The Expendables"" would be a category 4."
2,"Aaww, steroids....","Was that an Arnold cameo or was he auditioning for Grumpy Old Men 3? I couldn't tell. I'm glad Seagal or Jean Claude didn't get in on this - they've both made enough bad movies (but I still like 'em) so no reason to add another one to the list of krap! Thanks guys.Stallone was actually pretty good in this I thought and he still looks salvageable - I guess the roids haven't quite ravaged him as much as they did the Governator. Also glad to see Willis and O'Rourke had minor roles - they are both super annoying, so I just napped during their brief scenes. Stallone, Jet Li, the black dude (sorry I don't know his name) and Jason Statham (to a lesser extent) really carry the movie. 2.5 stars for some decent albeit freshman-level actions scenes, no stars for the wannabe Commando-like plot.Final Grade: C"
4,great movie,This is one of the best action movies i've seen in a while. The fight scenes are awesome and Stallone and the others still deliver at their age. Everybody in the film is over 40 and still kickin ass. i hope there's a sequel.
4,Not bad....,I enjoyed this movie. It wasn't bad at all. In fact I hope they come out with The Expendables II. Perhaps the next one might be bigger and badder than this one.
2,not my kind of action,"if i had saw this in the theaters, i probably would have walked out. maybe if i liked blood splattering and heads and limbs being chopped off then i would give it three stars. i love good action movies, but, movies that are bordering on horror and gore (Ninja Assassin comes to mind) are not the way i like my action."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,Was expecting a bad movie with lots of name brand actors. Was pleasantly surprised to find an action packed movie that was highly entertaining.
4,Violent and action-packed,"A group of mercenaries are hired by the CIA to remove a businessman from power because of his brutal dominance of a small island nation in the Caribbean where illegal drugs are being manufactured and sold. Plenty of action abounds, along with some graphic scenes of violence in this exciting guy flick. Many stars of modern action fare are present, and seeing them all together is quite a treat for those who enjoy fun summer action films. The requisite humor is present, which lightens the mood of this movie loaded with guns, fistfights, and explosions."
5,The Expendables,"Love this movie! A little hokey? Yes. A little predictable? Yes. Each ""Heros"" strengths were shown and emphasized, with a lot of punch (in both physical and comedy). Just a great ""get away from the world"" movie."
5,The expendables,A great fast action movie.All the stars in this one are great.You will not be dissapointed.Well put together story.And it was produce well.
3,Not as Good As the 1st One,The story line was not a intense as Expendables I. I did like that they made the group a bit more vulnerable than the first (i.e. they can be killed).
1,this movie should be shot on sight,"The title of this movie says it all -- this movie is expendable. Don't waste your time watching it. I like action movies, but this is about as bad as it get."
2,Its no Rocky,"Movie is clearly made for a paycheck, but it is somewhat entertaining and the fights are done OK. Great cast for this kind of movie."
3,Fun,"Has all the action stars, cheesy dialogue , and pretty good violence. Wish Arnold and Bruce were in it more though."
3,action packed,"Good flick, believable plot, lots of old guys having fun kicking but, if you like the typical Stallone flick you will like this one"
4,The Expendables HD,"I really liked this movies. It was a good action packed movie with alot to like and sure there are some not so good parts, but I find that in almost every movie, but overall I liked it."
3,very stallone,lots of shock and awe. Little storyline. previews and trailers made it look a little better than it actually was
5,For the Men!,I bought this for my hubby! He loves action films and this was a great one to add to his collection. We actually bought number 2 not too long ago! Great movies!
3,ok 3.5 stars - satisfies the he-man movie cravings,"Full cast of all your favorite badass testosterone overloaded actors, plenty of graphic violence, explosions, unbelievable odds and good fight scenes. And the ladies get to enjoy Jason Statham in all his goodness (this might be his best picture). What more could you ask for? (Ok, perhaps a little better STORY).Stallone is a bit hard to look at in this one, and age takes it's toll on everyone - but while he's the ""star"" in this, he gets his butt handed to him a time or two in this one, so I appreciate that much realism to the story at least.Typical testosterone movie, but if you're in the mood for one, chances are good you'll enjoy this one.What would it have taken to get me to give it a better rating? More personality and intelligence. They didn't win by being smarter/craftier - they won with a lot of balls, weapons and sheer luck. But if you just want action - this will provide."
4,The Expendables (Extended Director's Cut) [Blu-ray],"Well this one is made for the action. Lots of gunshots, artistic movements, muscular actors etc. Good for spending two hours, don't expect too much."
5,The Expendables,The Expendables is a great action movie starring Sylvester Stallone. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis have cameo appearances. There is subtle humor throughout the entire movie.
3,So the plot?,"Is fuzzy as hell and the final ending is rather silly. Basically there is a team of mercenaries, they do jobs, they have some loose canons, one of their lose canons betrays them, everything gets blown up on the guy who hired the loose canon, lots of bullets and bombs and in the end the mercenaries take the loose canon back into the fold. Pretty much that's it. Some ok performances and a surprise cameo and the rest is bullets, car chases, explosions etc. Plot is an excuse here... but its paced to keep things moving fast. An ok filler movie if you want a film that doesn't require you to think."
2,Not what I expected - weak story line,"Seeing the preview to the movie, I thought I would have seen Arnold S., among others. Arnold was only had a cameo. The story could have been much better as it was somewhat weak. If you took away all the explosions and try to stand on the story alone, I would have only given it one star."
3,Okay action flick .,"Has some stereotypical scenes that seem a bit cheesy. Overall plot was okay, but looking forward to watching version two!"
2,What a waste of an evening,This was a very bad story with acting to match. The movie was filmed in the dark so most of the time you only saw action in flashes. Directors seem to think filming in the dark makes the movie more suspenseful but I find it makes me wonder why I paid for HD.Stallone should get out of these always the same scenes where he has the stuffing beat out of him and then miraculously wins in the last seconds. Jason Statham was good but was not convincing as Stallone's sidekick.He seemed more intelligent than that.
3,If you like to see stuff blow up...,"Pretty weak. Great explosions, bad dialogue, weak plot. Did I mention the great explosions? Then I covered the highlights of this movie."
4,Good Movie,I enjoyed the action in the movie and it was great to see the older stars together. Would recommend to all.
1,Terrible,It seems as though the writer(s) didn't really care about plot or dialogue. They just slapped some one-liners together and made a lot of explosions. Even the fight scenes were hard to get through. It was just choppy cut after choppy cut of random punches and kicks. I guess they blew the budget on hiring as many action stars as they could and forgot to actually make a movie. I'm just glad it was free. I would have been upset if I had paid to see this garbage.
4,Unexpendable Expendables,"Having grown up with Stallone films, I was interested in The Expendables when it was released. I cheated and downloaded it off the net, yes, bad me, BUT, after seeing it I knew I had to pay to see it on the big screen. Which I did. I really enjoy this movie, the stars, the action. The Expendables is quite refreshing after years of ""can't build there, a bird lives there"", ""there are no losers, everyone gets a prize that participates"" political correctness. We need more of this."
1,Worst movie I've seen in the 21st Century!!,"I watched this when it was on sale for 99 cents. If it had been $3.99, I'd have given it a half star rating. The ""plot"" in this movie is weak. The ""script"" is so bad, that I could've written something better in a couple of hours. Some of the one-liners are just awful and dumb. At times, one gets the sense that even the actors know how bad this movies is! Don't watch this. It's sad because Stallone is capable of being a great actor. Check him out in ""Copland"" or ""F.I.S.T.""--he's great! I can't believe that he would act in this utter trash!! I hate this movie!"
1,In The Company Of Old Men,"I found this film tasteless and boring with a feeling to why the heck was it ever made, when you see Bruce and big Arnie bow out early, take it as a cue for you to do likewise, even the normally dependable Jason Statham looks bored.I'm off to rewatch the last Rambo film, that has violently good action, this is just an expendable waste of time."
1,Jean Claude was Smart,Arnold and Bruce stuck their heads in. Other than that it was just Explosions and Machine Guns. I wish I'd bought two six-packs. Sly used to make some good movies. This was not one of them...IT SUCKED
2,"Lotsa Action, Little Substance","2010 had 2 action films that were populated by old-time actors. RED was outstanding, and this one, in which it seems like all the actors think they're still matinee idols. When the film starts, there's no end of listing the producers, associate producers, executive producers, etc. Red flags immediately went up in my head. I tried really hard to keep an open mind, but the script was so bad, I couldn't believe what was presented to me. It's a dark film, and it's intentions are geared entirely to the action audience that's looking for 'splosions 'n stuff. I'm sorry but this one just didn't do it for me. It simply wasn't entertaining. As an alternative, I would most highly recommend RED, old guys going crazy and having as much fun as their audience."
3,Didital Copy Expired,"The Blu Ray and the DVD discs play just fine, but why do we also have to pay for a digital copy when it is already expired? The releasing companies need to advise in their advertising and promotion of a product if one or more of the features has expired and is useless. Otherwise, the movie was ok. Amazon.com should also be made aware of this issue so they can provide this info to their customers."
3,GREAT MOVIE - SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN BRAILLE,"Unfortunately most of this movie takes place at night in the dark. The soundtrack makes me wish I could see more clearly what is happening. During the opening sequence that takes place in the dimly lit interior of a ship, I said to my wife, ""I hope the rest of the film isn't like this"". Unfortunately, it was. Most of the action scenes were at night in dimly lit places. All we could see were glimpses of arms and legs lit by muzzle flashes. For us, we would have enjoyed this movie so much more if we were able to actually ""see"" it. The only saving grace was that at least the explosions were well lit and ""some"" of the scenes were in daylight. I think i'll re-label this DVD ""soundtrack""."
3,Not a bad movie...,"Personally a good movie, but it has to make you wonder if the old guys are just trying to keep up on the game. If you like guns, a simple storyline and a lot of action, this is for you."
3,80's Cornball style no longer relevant,"I would have loved this in the 80's, maybe because I was in high school. Big fan of all the actors, but this was just too stupid of a movie to enjoy. It's like an A-Team episode except they show people getting shot. Boring, predictable and many scenes are ""what's this scene have to do with the movie?""Blech"
5,Very Entertaining Stallone Rarely Disappoints,When this released in the theatre it got lost for us in the Losers and A-Team howver when we rented the DVD we were so impressed we opted for the Blu-Ray with digital copy.
4,Great Action Movie,"I saw this in the theater, and had a really great time. Great action story that does a great job of weaving in action hero's that can still carry a movie. What a ride seeing all these guys on one flick. Well done!"
1,Disappointed!,This book is not what you are looking for if you expect the answers in the back. I wanted to provide my grandson with additional math problems...and quick reference for answers. You would need the teachers text book for the answers.
5,Sports Car Ride Again,"The car now handles and corners better than it was new. However, the suspension is quite firm and may not appeal to those looking for a comfortable, floaty ride over bumps. If that is your preference, go with a cheaper Monroe or Gabriel product."
4,Jane Brody's Good Food Gourmet Cook Book,"Just as enjoyable and nutritious as Jane Brody's other cook book. Some of the recipes are the same as in Jane Brody's Good Foods, but still worth reading."
4,"Classy, underrated, ignored too long","Freiheit, as they're known outside of Germany, is a band that seems largely ignored or unknown outside of their homeland. And that's a shame. Most of their songs would be hits if they were played in the US. They have a true knack for creating catchy, inspired tunes that you'll be humming for hours, if not days, afterward. Their anthem is ""So Lang' Man Traume Noch Leben Kann;"" in English ""Keeping the Dream Alive."" The English version was featured on the soundtrack of the movie ""Say Anything,"" and has long been a favorite song of mine. From the orchestration to the vocal harmonies, to the lyrics and ideas behind them, it is a complete, nearly perfect song.""Alle Jahre Alle Hits"" is an amazing collection for an amazing price. 39 songs for $19?? This CD presents their songs in German, but they do have other releases in English, and I recommend giving them a listen, because you won't be disappointed in either language. Don't pass this up."
3,Fewer stars for contemptible characters,"Again - a good mystery, with annoying characters. Miss Zukas is supposed to be self-reliant and controlled; and yet she puts up with her alleged friends' inexcusable meddling and manipulation. When I reached the end and found that her ""friend"" Ruth had taken from Miss Zukas' closet and put on public display artwork which, it had been established in earlier books, Miss Zukas did not choose to share with others and in fact would periodically throw away, I couldn't believe it; and that on top of the constant attempts to pester Helma about her relationship with Police Chief Gallant. If I'm supposed to think, ""Oh, how touching - her friend is only trying to help her,"" it isn't working. What her friend is doing is showing no respect for Helma or her personality or her privacy or her choices. What a creep. I wish the author would give Helma some gumption and have her tell Ruth to knock it off and mind her own business."
1,Want my money back,1. The information states the hairpins are silver. They are NOT SILVER.. but a dark gun metal color or a very dark silver. Not good for gray hair. They don't have ball tips. I was charged $1.59 for the hairpins and they charged me $4.37 for shipping and the hairpins didn't even weigh a lb. What a rip-off I knew the cost when I ordered them but expected silver (the color of a dime) and good tips. They are neither one.One BIG RIP-OFF......... Don't waste your money.
4,Mandarin for everyone,A great set of learning discs for Chinese. This is the language of the future. Everyone concerned about the world of economics should learn Mandarin.
2,It is what it is,Book has lots of historical trivia and facts. Topic could have been written on the backs of baseball cards. .
1,"I bought it, I read it, I liked it, NOT!","Roger Dawson's book, ""Secrets of Power Persuasion"" lacked secrets, power, and persuasion. I bought it with some anticipation, due to a positive recommendation by a colleague. Upon reflection, I can see why this colleague was excited and I should have been a bit more cautious with the recommendation.I read the book and struggled the whole way through. Honestly, I put the book down before finishing the last chapter. I just could not invest anymore time in it. Mr. Dawson lacked the power to persuade me that what he offered were secrets, powerful or otherwise. Hogan and Cialdini have superior books on the subject and are very inviting to read.Even as a book of introduction to the topic of persuasion I could not recommend this book."
2,Selling common sense as secrets?,"Was this an autobiography? It sure read that way, considering the author referenced his personal wealth and possessions more than he referenced persuasion. A very vain man, it seems. Mr. Dawson's 'secrets' are little more than packaged common sense. I give this book two 'mercy' stars because there were one or two ideas that I found helpful. One or two, not three. In short, this book revealed very little about persuasion, let alone persuade me to pick up any of the author's other books."
2,Love the cards but missing the letter G,"The cards are beautiful and good quality. I want to use as ""art"" for my daughters' play room. Was so pleased in looking through them until I got to where the letter G should have been and found the letter S. Thought maybe G would be where S should be - but no such luck - just another S. I'm hoping Amazon can correct this problem and I can get a G. Anyone missing a S?"
5,Beautiful artwork (and perfect for gender neutral room!).,"The cards come in a lovely box (tied with a ribbon inside) and are perfect for framing, hanging, or playing with! The colours are gorgeous and calming - and the artwork is both charming & fun!"
5,GREAT,"whats there to say,i live on the edge of no where[my choice],where stations,the close ones are 70 miles to over 200 an this radio pulls them in great.I will buy another when this ones gives up[10 years an counting]but then it might out live me."
1,"broken on arrival, no power, no way to turn it on","i got the radio today, took it out the box, couldnt turn it on. It looks like it is already broken.. Too late to return it to Amazon, Grundig help line is closed as their work on pacific time and i live on the east coast. So i dont know yet, what i m gonna do with this broken radio.It was a gift for my dad I ordered it a month before his birthday, you have 30 day to send it back to amazon. If you buy something make sure you test it before the 30 days goes by. I ll post another review later, if i get another functionning radio, to tell you at least if they work well. So far i dont know, no power with the power supply or battery.Is this purely bad luck or bad quality??2 weeks later...going trough replacement they just sent me another one quickly who works perfectly, .Well I was just out of luck, easy and reliable customer service...Radio workds like a charm, good soung, good reception,would buy again....4 stars now"
1,Expensive JUNK !! Horrible Reception..,"My 10 dollar portable Panasonic radio has BETTER and Clearer reception than this overpriced crap. Even if the radio is by my window , reception is static and horrible. Don't fall for the GRUNDING name like I did, you can get a high quality shortwave radio for much less. Panasonic makes one for 40 bucks !!! Amazon also carries that awesome panasonic portable for less then 10 bucks. I feel ripped off by Grundig. Boycott this crap."
5,"Great live tracks, a must buy for any Korn fan","If there is one Import CD-Single by Korn to buy, this is it. Usually when I buy an Import I expect one thing and get a totally different, and much worse experience. But the Good God CD Single delivers. It features the studio version and a live version of the Life is Peachy track, ""Good God"" plus live versions of ""Need To"" and ""Divine"" (Which goes into the track 'Proud' for about a minute). With these awesome live versions, you cannot go wrong with buying this Import. I also recommend the Import version of ADIDAS and Make Me Bad."
2,A way to get started (and frustrated) with a TabletPC,"I've had my machine for almost a year now. It has gone back for trackpad problems once. In addition the CMOS battery was replaced, the case was cracking and it was replaced as well. It was fixed in a timely manner, but it is now doing the same thing. The machine is noisy, hot and the battery life is horrible. I bought it as a cheap way to get into a tablet. I'm convinced of the value of having a tablet; I just need to get a better tablet. If you get one, get an extended warranty."
3,pls completely check this product before u buy,"here u go my story.i purchased this product through online after read the reviews in different websites.i had a login problem and startup problem with this pc.actually wht the problem is...when i restart this pc it becomes ideal abt 20 to 30 mins and shows windows starting up........ screen.i called customer support but thy said simply "" return this product at your own expense"".so i returned this product in retailer store.but thy charged $200 to me becaz i opened and use this pc. i hardly used this pc abt 1hr .tht's it!!!!!!!!!!!!.i guess this problem is not only in my tablet pc and it is basic problem to all averatec tablet pc.so pls check completely before u buy this product."
4,Cool toy that changes into squirt gun,My kids love Ben-10 so it was a natural that they would want the whole she-bang during the holidays (from the RV to the characters and watch). This is a cool action figure which comes with its ship. It can also convert into a squirt gun which makes for double the fun (unless their siblings don't want to be squirted of course). It also makes it a nice toy for the tub as well. It's pretty well made given the price and size and is larger than many of the smaller action figures that because of the addition of the ship.
2,Yet another PBS Living Edens series....,"The living Edens series just happens to be a product of the time shortly before the DVD format. It shows how far we have come in such a short time. At any rate, Faye Dunaway's narration was stellar with a type of professionalism of a college speech and english professor. She tells Thailand's story with keen inflexion and sophisticated integrity. The problem with this Living Edens is ""like the rest"" a brief time to explain and cover huge territories and as a result the series is forced to concentrate on the familiar or cliche'd aspects of a given biome or region. With that said we end up missing a great deal of what the area/s has to offer.In reflecting it was a nice documentary among the best of the Living Edens series but nothing of anything really special by todays standards."
4,Great Value!,This bobby pins do exactly whats expected of them to do! They are hardy and help style my hair.
5,more than just photo paper,"As a new photography student, I find this paper to be easy to work with in relation to photo paper I have used in a copier. It's easy to grasp and separate from the other sheets, a must in a darkroom!"
4,Gov't Mule has some great friends:),"Warren Haynes has been doing a benefit show in Ashville,NC for years, but this year the concert moved to a much larger venue. It was a very cold windy day, and there was still some snow to be found around the Auditorium. The 2 cd's capture all of the best moments of the night. There is a few songs from everyone that was there. The Derek Trucks set was just amazing. And the night just got better and better from then on. The Govt Mule set was the show stopper. I think that everyone was on that stage at one time or another. The highlight of the whole eavning had to be Little Milton singing ""Merry Christmas Baby"". Wow what a legend. So, if ya like the Mule and there friends that always show up. This is a must have.. ian lee"
4,good music,I love Susan T. and the Trucks Bank. Like all the music. I find it is even better after a couple of drinks and I can just mellow out and really take the time to allow it to move through me.
2,Only for the most die-hard of 007 fans,"I gave this game to my dad as a gift one christmas (because he owns every single 007 movie that has been made) and we played it that day. Nobody got a single question right. This game it only for those of you who are die-hard fans. It asks such obscure questions from the older movies that when we learned the answer, it was one of those, ""That was not even one of the choices in my mind.""Good for a gift for someone who always watches the movies. I just felt like I wasted my money on it."
3,Made good gift,"We did not get a chance to play this game but can tell you it was a very popular item at our annual gift exchange party. It went through a number of ""gift steals"" before landing with its final owner.Feedback from that person after using it was ""lots of fun""."
3,bike basket,"I was disappointed in the product. The wire spacing is far apart so you need to carry anything small in another bag, The spiral tape that is suppose to be included was not in the package, The basket also is very small and overpriced in my opinion. The product is sturdy. I would not buy again."
3,Way smaller than expected,"We recently bought a huffy bike for me and added this basket. I like going to the grocery store by bike and being able to store the groceries in my basket. Unfortunately we didn't take a good enough look at the measurement, because the basket is very small! It's so small that it would never be able to hold my groceries. It looks more like a kid's basket.A bit disappointed, but I guess we should have paid more attention to the measurements."
2,"Good songs, BAD repackage","I've been a fan of these songs since they first came out in '62 & '63. But when I look at a repackage like this, I wonder... WHY? This contains 10 songs grabbed seemingly at random from the 2 original albums, and features the cover art from the 2nd album with a new (and less-appealing) lettering than on the originals. Wouldn't it have made more sense to just put ALL 24 songs in the proper sequence and issue a ""twofer""? My suggestion is, if this is your thing, skip this, go for the originals (but buyer beware-- this is not the only inexplicable repackage of this material out there!)."
1,Get 2007 version,Please note to get instead the new great sounding Capitol 2007 release which has all 24 songs plus one bonus and is very reasonably priced. The 2006 version has a recording flaw. This is a classic Christmas album that should be FULLY enjoyed and the 2007 is the best version out there!
2,Terrible Quality,"I bought these because they are the only brackets on the market that work with my custom 27mm swaybar.I bought these to replace the ones it came with, because one side broke. I put these on, and the other side broke.its the metal that is breaking too, not the poly bushing."
3,FAR TOO PROSAIC,"Olds could be writing short prose pieces and make it pass for a short novel. These ""poems"" don't even really pass for ""psalms"", which I suspect her to be moving towards. Interesting contents but I believe she needs to stop writing for writing's sake."
2,Prose,"This is not poetry, it is prose. Or if it is not, then what, I wonder, is prose? Read an excerpt aloud and see for yourself."
1,It's not for the beginners,"It's not what it promises -- it's not for the beginners. Exercises are difficult and hard to follow, since she combines a few small routines into one, and you have to constantly watch her, never being sure when she changes the exercise. The explanations are confusing. There is no any structure from easy to more difficult, so you actually don't achieve anything and don't progress. Also, when the first 10 minutes pass, you have to use the remote control to start all over again."
4,Pretty good pilates instruction,"I am not ""green"" when it comes to pilates. I have been doing simple pilates moves ever since I saw some workouts in Cosmo magazine years ago. However, there's nothing like good instruction to help you keep form and pace. This DVD does the trick for me. I bought the beginner version because I'm not an avid exerciser and I just wanted something to help me strengthen my weak core muscles. I knew most of the exercises on this DVD, but I wasn't using proper form and breathing (it's difficult to pick that up just by looking at pictures on a page). The instruction is good and Kristin always reminds you to ""keep your shoulders soft"" or ""don't shift your hips."" It's almost like she is right there with you. I also like that you can customize your routine for days when you have more/less time for a workout. I don't have much to complain about regarding this dvd, other than i wish there were more varied routines to choose from."
4,Great,This helped introduce me to a whole new way of working out. Easy to follow. I worked up a seat and there are so many routines that you cant get bored easily.
2,Single din kit,"Work fine in my car, but the problem is, thay make only one universal color and doesn't mech with my dash. Little disappointed!"
1,"Wrong color, doesn't fit","In my 2004 Volvo V70, this unit is too light in color and leaves a gap on the left. Waste of $50."
1,Not very helpful,"I was told by another person that grows an herb gardens that this book is a must, but it really didn't help me at all."
1,Vert Disapointed,Horrible toy. Spent an hour trying to put it together and finally gave up. Not worth trying to put it together even if you got it for free. Every time you snap a piece on another falls off and so on...
2,Charicatures,"All the people here are portrayed like characters. Jackie Wilson makes me think of Little Richard (Leon also played LR in an earlier movie), Little Richard is too gay while singing about girls (he was bi) and they just messed up some facts. The crowd is wilder than at a Metallica concert or so are the acts.Nelson tries but can't him down correctly, the actor in American Hot Wax did a better job. Still a + for the effort.Read the book it was based on called Big Beat Heat, that's a lot better."
3,"Good description, boring content","Ueland writes with enthusiasm and is very good at describing persons, places, and things. But, the content left something to be desired. Nothing ever happens but not with as much charm as a Barbara Pym book."
3,Just a perch..,"My parrotlets like to be on this perch- but that's about as far as it goes. They don't use it for the calcium that I can tell- They much more prefer their cuttlebone, which only costs $1... So needless to say I will be taking the cheaper route from now on. Though they do like their Pollen Perch. I would highly recommend getting one of those instead. Much more worth the money!"
4,Understanding is a good thing,"Is propaganda having more adherents truth, and that having fewer mind-control? Power is self-serving. It only seeks to extend itself, consolidate itself, protect itself. To that end control of the population's world-view is crucial. In some countries it's less sophisticated; in others it's more so. People, however, are quite alike in fundamental ways. It's a shame we don't have more statesman encouraging dialogue and mutual understanding and promoting the COMMON GOOD (which, it seems to me, should be a matter of common sense). ""ALL MEN are created equal . . ."""
4,Incredibly close,"Mesmerizing, appalling and understandable. A must see for everyone interested in a communistic society where dictatorial power almost reaches divinity..."
4,An unprecedented glimpse behind the curtain,"A fascinating and often disturbing vision of what the children of North Korea's elite will subject themselves to in order to please their ""father"", Kim Jong-Il. While I applaud the film-makers for their excellent work, I had to take exception with two points. First, they seem to accept without reservation the idea that the US would seriously consider invading North Korea. Second, their translation tones down the language that is used by their subjects to refer to Americans throughout the film. ""Migungnom"" is literally ""American bastard""."
4,A Peek Into The Forbidden,"North Korea is the least understood place in the world. No wonder. Their brainwashing makes that of Stalin and Hitler seem positively amateurish. They have carried the ""collective"" mentality to it's limit. Yet these 2 girls love to laugh, play, and socialize. Their parents just want a comfortable income and healthy relationships just like we do. Yet the poison of communism is slowly destroying their souls."
4,Worth it!!!!,"Typical of British cinema that tries to imitate popular American topics, this film gets a bit ""wordy"", at times; however, there is a scene between the teenage boy and his neighbor that is one of THE MOST erotic scenes I have ever witnessed in a movie and I'm 56 years old!!!!!! It was amazing!!! For that scene alone, it's worth the purchase of this DVD...Enjoy!!!!!"
2,People behaving badly,"This film explores the power of evil and its effect on people. The primordial evil in this film is anti-gay bigotry. During the film you can see it morph and mestastasise as it spreads from person to person. There is nothing enjoyable or uplifting in the story but for some this will be a very interesting film to watch. Love as a power for good never makes an appearance. In fact, good never makes an appearance.If you are looking for a film that explores the power of evil but with a more uplifting message, I would recommendShank - Unrated Director Cut. Both Shank and Clapham Junction are very disturbing films but in Shank good in the form of love triumphs over evil."
2,reviewed much better than I expected,A decent film of gay London and the lives of single lonely men intersecting with straight friends or couples. Good list of actors but the plot was all over the place. A couple of interesting sub plots but for at least half the film I just fast forwarded.
3,Didn't wow me.,"A too-slavish recreation of the Serge Gainsbourg sound. Long on icy cool intellectualism, short on personal innovations."
4,This kind of works for an 87 Honda Prelude,"I have an 87 Honda prelude 2.0si manualThe speedometer cable was just right except for the connector that goes into the transmission, it was too big and I had to grind down the metal to make it skinny (it works now)It's hard to find parts for a car this old so I do what I canI got it delivered a day early and it $50 less than I would've had to pay at the parts store, so it was worth grinding it down.. Anyhow, if you need this part, be sure to have a grinder available!"
2,"Decent, but too scattered","I own every season of ""The Universe"" on blu-ray, and if you wanted to decide what to get? Go for Season 1 of ""The Universe"" over this. It has its moments, and does look good on blu-ray, but those are the only strong points. It tends to get a little off-target, at times. The aforementioned ""The Universe"" tends to stay much more on topic with relation to the planets, and looks great on blu-ray, also. Skip over this unless you don't own that set on blu-ray."
2,Dumbed down,"I had high hopes for this series, but the predominant feeling I have after watching it is disappointment. What a shame, because there are moments that are quite well done, but they tend to get lost in the rat-tat-tat rhythm of the editing, the incessant music which often jars, and lots of ""whooshing"" sound effects. The producers of this series are keenly interested in the possibility of life elsewhere in the Solar System, to the point where some episodes are devoted almost entirely to speculation on the subject, while one wants more time spent on conveying information about what is actually known about the various planets and their characteristics. A good series for children and adolescents; not so satisfying for adults. It does have its moments, though, now and then."
3,OK - not essential,"Down By Law & Pseudo Heroes. What these 2 bands share in common (besides that catchy poppy punk (but not ""pop punk"") sound) is Sam Williams, III - who plays guitar for Down By Law (and, other than leader Dave Smalley, is the longest-standing member of that band), and vocals & guitar (and bandleader) for Pseudo Heroes.The first 5 songs comprise the debut release for Pseudo Heroes - and their stuff on here definitely outshines the DBL stuff. I almost feel that DBL is only on here to sell the records so that people can hear the Pseudo Heroes stuff. The 5 songs from Pseudo Heroes are definitely DBL-influenced, so fans of DBL should definitely pick this up to see what Sam is doing in his spare time. My favorite song on here by them is definitely ""Fickle Fate"".The 5 DBL songs here are really for DBL diehards only. The songs are simply cover songs, recorded live on a European tour. Nothing special....DBL writes such good songs, I would rather have had 5 new songs than this."
4,Soul that walks a different path,"If variety is the spice of life, then Wishing Street brings it on full flavor. Favorite cut, Heaven's Key...sends chills up the spine. Not only because it is crafted in a unique blend of rich powerful writing but it is sung with soulful passion..I don't think this one could be topped. Other songs that make you want to stop what your doing and just listen are the title cut Wishing Street, Eastern Standard Time and I Will Ride. This album has something for everyone, a little gospel sound in Confessors Hymn, a little fun in La La La La (although this was my least favorite, it takes you right out of the last song and brings on a new mood). Kudos to Ian Charles for a masterful job on what could be my favorite CD to date. Buy it, Try it, It's well worth every penny."
4,The True,I feel this cd. It has touched me in some real hard times. It is hard to find music that is true. Music that the artist has lived. I feel if you have not lived it you shouldn't rap about it. This cd is worth buying. 4 sho.
3,Chosen is gone... bad for the Monster Klick,"CLOUT if you can find it, is a much better album. This cd is tight, but with Chosen gone -- it lacks what CLOUT has.Good Buy tho.MOSS POINT!"
5,The most practical success book ever!,"Kiefer is the Napolean Hill of the 1990s. His book provides practical steps to determine what is important in your life, translate these into goals, then instructs you how to go about achieving them. Nowhere else have I seen such a comprehensive manual on success and personal achievement. His writing style is interesting and very extremely easy to read."
5,COOL,"Pet Shop Boys are awesome by themselves or with other artists.They're good at what they do, and here's the proof!"
5,Consistently Great,"In all of the years that the Pet Shop Boys have been putting out music of their own as well as producing for others, they have maintained a level of consistency of powerful music and cd's of excellent content.Disco 4 is no exception. It has taken artists and songs which seem inately popular and allows the listener to say, 'Hell, yeah"" when the next tune comes on. Their mixing and remastering skills are beyond reproach and have once again delivered a compilation of songs that you can listen to, dance to and hum in your head long after the music has stopped!"
2,Pet Shop Boys( Experimental) DISCO 4,"My heart actually sank when I heard the first track by The Killers. I said to myself, where are The Pet Shop Boys? When I buy a disc by The Pet Shop Boys, I assume it's them, not others. A closer view of the label explain's why. The previous DISCO disc's were just them, so be forewarned. The first disaster is of course Yoko Ono.Her shreiking, shrill of a voice can't be saved by the disco beat. Even the hair on the back of a cat ,would stick straight up due to such punishment. I already had Sorry from Madonna's cd single. Hallo Space Boy fares better, with semi-queer David Bowie, an old master, but then so are the Pet Shop Boys, and yet, I still would have preferred to hear only them. I'm With Stupid works well, a decent rendition. The standout is Hooked On Radiation, reminiscent of good old boy Giorgio Moroder. Ahh, he is really missed. So if you buy this cd, make sure you get it on sale, to make sure you get your bang for your buck, so to speak!"
1,Disappointing,I don't really know what to write really except that I was kind of disappointed with this purchase. It doesn't seem to be up to the usual stuff that I expect from the Pet Shop Boys.
2,At Least it Has The Greek,"If you know Greek, and don't care about using it as a reference work, this is a good, inexensive edition. It contains the fragments in Greek.On the pages opposite the Greek, though, is not a translation. Instead, it is an adaptation into English. This adaptation is occasionally inspired, often mediocre, and almost never what Heraclitus said."
3,a little short sleeve,Great price on a close out but being billed as a tall it is a little short on the sleeves for a long. Maybe why on special? Not short enought to send back but short :-((
2,Not everyone writes rock songs,"If you are an instrumental/classical composer, if you don't know lots of A&R people (or if you don't know what A&R is don't expect him to tell you in the book), or if you want to save yourself some money that you could be using to promote your music online: don't bother with this book. I read it cover to cover and I didn't learn anything useful. A) It took several chapters before he even gets to the self-publishing. And B) once you are there you realize just how impossible it is. I'm not bitter, I just don't write the kind of music he is talking about. But I also think music is like any business: it's who you know, not how good you are. So, get out there and network!"
4,At Last,"At last, a book that offers an insightful guide to dreams without being patronising or predictable. It contains a comprehensive range of dreams, and makes sense of them on three levels.First a general kabbalistic interpretation, which often incorporates a psychological observation; second the potential spiritual position of the dreamer, and third, a guide to self-improvement.The images of each dream are not complicated with distracting and irrelevant detail, therefore it is easy to extract meaning and guidance from the images, which are presented in alphabetical order.Finally it serves as a useful introduction to the Kabbalah in an authoritative manner without being dry or heavily academic. It is now a book which I refer to again and again."
5,No Sophomore Slump here,"I was intrigued by Gruber's first outing, Tropic of Night. I expected a let down for book two.... Boy was I disappointed -- and delighted! It's like he went to the world's greatest writing school and immediately learned how to expand his best parts and whittle back the slower sections of Tropic of Night.Valley of Bones will surely be the best book I read this year. I'm sure of it and it's not even July.On to # 3 !"
3,"Well Done, Indeed!","A man is thrown to his death from a high-rise. Cops rush to the scene and find a woman in his apartment. She is arrested for murderer, but claims to be possessed by a demon that makes her do things she can't always remember. Nice blend of horror and mystery and worth reading."
5,"One of the best ""thrillers"" I have read","A complex and intriguing story, written with such intimacy I felt that I knew the heroine personally. Outstanding!"
3,Overly long and complicated but satisfying,"This is a surprising book; not at all what I expected when I picked it up. I think the billing as a `thinking man's thriller' is an inanely bold and overused statement, but it was more intelligent than a lot of the trash in the same genre that I've read lately.It is too long, and occasionally tends towards being more descriptive than is necessary or appropriate. Long stretches are just downright boring. Most of the writing is unremarkable.The book really shines in the first-person style confession scattered throughout the book. These narratives contain some very nice nuggets of prose which are even insightful. There are thought-provoking religious themes throughout, which I found more interesting than I would have expected too.The plot is slightly contrived, but most of the threads are tied up by the end of the book."
2,"Poor writing with an unbelievable, convoluted plot.","I don't agree with the other reviews of this novel. The central characters are so unlikable and poorly sketched that you have to wonder why anybody would care about them. Why do the main characters have panic attacks and trouble sleeping? Well, you will never know because the author tells us so little about them and their histories. The plot is so confusing and complex---where is the evil?----that you just want to finish the book to end the agony.I cannot recommend this book to anybody."
1,too expensive,why does the kindle version cost almost as much as the printed version. Dont fall for this type of price gouging or Kindle will be ruined.
1,Poor quality,"The first time I used this chipper one of the ""teeth"" fell out. The second time I used it another fell out. The third time I used it two more fell out. It is usless now!"
1,USELESS waste of money!!!,"I bought this for my brownie baking company -- I break a LOT of of 10-lb tablets of chocolate -- and the first time I put it into a tablet of chocolate, the tines bent! I'd give it 0 stars if that were possible.Don't waste your hard-earned cash. This must be one of those ""kitchen toys"" that are functionally useless, intended for people who don't cook but want the kitchen to look as though they know what they're doing."
5,The text book for Hanen Project,"This is the text book for the Hanen Project. Hanen is a course that parents of speech delay children can go through to learn to speak with their children. This book is an excellent guide to understanding how to get through to your child. The methods used are simple and successful. This book is best utilized with the Hanen course, but taking the course is not necessary. The book has helped me break into my childs world and now we can play and he can say some words. I highly recommend this book if you are unable to communicate with your child."
2,Don't Try This At Home - Alone,"From the other reviews, I see this book is meant to be used in conjunciton with a course, therapy and coaching from a professional. It is not a ""do it yourself"" guide, as the name implies. For this reason I am returning it. I am disappointed, but mainly it is my own fault, because I did not carefully read the description and reviews."
4,Very Good but very expensve book,"This is a very good and easy to understand book, that a parent could get to start working at home with a child with language delays. I have gotten a few books on speech delay now so the information now is starting to become repetative for me. The informaton makes sense, and it does give very easy suggestions for parents to beable to work with their childern. THis book was recommended to me by my speech pathologist, but I could only find it on Amazon. My only complaint of it would be the expense for it...not cheap."
4,Helpful tool for the slow to speak child,"I found this book to be useful with its tips on aiding the slow speech developer within the home. It is easy to read and informative, offering helpful advice which stays with you when it comes to communicating with your child. Much of the tips are those offered by the speech language therapist, but generally you do not remember them all when told, but having this book handy reinforces them."
4,zorndorf,a great book on the battle of Zorndorf where frederick fought russia although nobody really won describes the battle in detail
3,Don't expect super high quality,Don't expect super high quality and you won't be disappointed. These are cheap inflatable beach balls. We ordered about 2 dozen for party favors at a childs birthday party. Of the two dozen about 6 wouldn't hold air well and deflate after about a day.
3,They were from Long Island.,Wilkinson Tricycle was from Long Island. Roslyn I think. In 1969 I was briefly in a band with a bass player named Peter Cannonball Nanos who had worked with them before they got signed to CBS.
4,Cute story,"This is basicly just ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" rewritten into twelve pages, with fully page illustrations. For a children's book, it's pretty good."
4,windsor jr high kids review,very good i did have an idea who Molly's mom was and i was right! but i never would have guessed who the dad is. it was very good i finished it in 2 days and i cannot wait until i get my hands on MOLLY MOON'S HYPNOTIC TIME TRAVEL ADVENTURE
4,Great Book though not as good as the 1st one,"This book was really good. It's really different from the first one with a whole new setting and story. The one thing I disliked about the book that at times it could be slightly boring and it also wasn't as good as the 1st one. The best part is close to the end, this book has an amazing ending. I highly recommend this book, read it!"
3,good for kids,"i am 13 and i just read this book, while i admit the end of the book was really good, the other parts r really dry and unexciting for a middle schooler, or at least an 8th grader. but i would think 10 and 11 yr olds would love this book."
2,disappointed,"I'm disappointed that Reelcraft would use ""plastic"" for the spool. I'm very pleased with other Reelcraft products I've purchased. I thought if it was a Reelcraft it would be good. Not so. If they're going to produce a lower quality product I would suggest they us a different brand name. Even the cheap imports are all metal. This spool is warped and was broken in shipment."
1,Huge & Confusing,"Got this several months ago & still haven't used it. It's way too big for me. I'd have to take it apart & re-sew to fit. Also it was confusing due to strap configuration. I am a smart person, yet had to spend too much time figuring it out, then realizing that to make it fit me, the binoc hookups were on my shoulders (instead of at chest) due to adjustment hardware being in the way. I checked out my friend's harness, which has 4 attachments in back instead of 3, & his is so much better (& it's a no-name brand). I am 5'4"", & 110 lbs. Do not recommend."
4,Good Bird Bra and a good price,"If you are a serious birder, you probably already know about ""bird bras"" that move the weight of your binoculars from your neck to your shoulders. These are essential if you plan to spend the entire day in the field.I have tried harnesses from several different manufacturers. Compared to others, these are ""stiffer,"" holding the binocs in place better. I like that feature, but you may prefer some other, looser straps.These are less expensive than similar harnesses, which is always nice."
5,Shoulder harness--great value,This harness is great for taking the weight of binoculars off your neck and allocating it over your back and shoulders. The harness is a little complicated to get into but this would also be true of any competitor--and the price of this one can't be beat.
2,Engaging? More like boring...,"Given the premise I really wanted to like this series but found it boring and lacking any sort of depth from the first episode. The characters were very one dimensional and you never get to the point of caring about any of them. Again, interesting premise but not a show that you are looking forward to the next episode. I found watching all the episodes a real chore and I was just waiting for each one to be over. I'm typically interested in a lot of the BBC shows yet this one just didn't deliver."
2,Did I Miss Something...?,"I loved the premise of this series and eagerly anticipated how the storyline would unfold. When I saw the final episode last night on PBS, I felt ripped off. Jane Horrocks and the other actors were very well cast in their roles, but the writing was terrible. The series quickly digressed into a soap opera format, and the last episode left the audience in mid-muddle with no clear resolution of Ros's ethical dilemma. ""The Amazing Mrs. Pritchard"" had lots of potential to be a novel addition to Masterpiece Theater, but it suffered from extremely poor execution. A very sub-par Masterpiece Theater product that one hopes will not be repeated in the future."
5,This series was wonderful! Loved it!,I highly recommend this series. I couldn't wait to see the next episode. Loved it! Would like to see more kinds of British drama of this quality!
3,Funny but often flat British comedy,"Ros is a grocery store manager who after beaking up a fight between two parliment candidates mentions that she could do better, and manages to profess this in front of a news camera. Soon she is the toast of the town, and finds herself not only elected, but an inspriation to other women who also run for office. Plenty of fish out of water antics ensue as she navigates the hallowed halls of Parliment as the first down to Earth PM.The story has its up and downs, but I had a hard time with ""Bubble"" from Absolutely Fabulous being the PM. The writing is a bit uneven at times as well. While not a disappoint (love British comedy!), it is more middle of the road."
2,CHEAP JUNK,"I'm pretty disappointed in this product. Typical junk from China. It is made of cheap plastic, difficult to operate, and not very loud. Wish I had gone to a store and bought something I could examine first"
2,Talking alarm clock,"Bought this clock for a seeing impaired elderly person. She must rely on the audio which is a woman speaking too fast and abrupt. You need to keep the instructions nearby because the buttons on the clock could accidently set the clock to announce the time hourly, non stop, until a seeing intelligent person could reset it.Shipping by Amazon was the best."
3,"Looks good, but feels cheap.","It fits the Nexus 7 great. It looks okay, but the materials are pretty cheap feeling. The pink sheen is from flat sequins on the back. After mild use, one has already fallen off. There is a confusing cutout on the opposite side of the Power/Volume buttons near the bottom-left side. When held upside down, you could easily mistake it for the cutout for the power and volume. It's okay, but I wouldn't get it again."
3,Not for Everyone,"I rented this movie for my son sometime before he turned 3. As he is into all the cars and stuff, I said sure. He was glued to it at first, but then got bored of it by the end. Sometimes he is still into it, but most of the time he prefers to see the movie cars by pixar/disney. This is good for playing like an episode once in a while, but not for sitting straight though. Me being a parent have gotten use to toddler and baby shows being rediculous, so I have learned not to pay any attention to it."
3,Canon MP390,"Communication errors between older computer with Windows 98 and Canon MP390. Unloaded and reloaded software numerous times as suggested by Canon. Eventually corrected scanner communication errors by using originally installed USB1 port rather than later installed USB2 port.Printer is slow to start printing, copying or scanning, however, quality of output is good.FAX requires a telephone or answering machine connected to MP390 to function properly."
5,Beautiful product,"Beautiful product, cheapest price, ink is so good and long lasting, please buy this machine, canon is great!"
5,Best for the price.,"I searched high and low for a bargain. $400 for a quality all-in-one is just crazy! The MP390 is the best for the price. Great scanning quality, awesome photo prints, and a good all around solid printer. The fax is something to get use to, you have to scan them in, then send them. The machine does it all for you, but if you have a large document to fax, it could be a burden. But let's face it, it's for home use and the ""occassional"" fax. I can live with it."
3,Canon MP390,"I have had this printer for about a year now and I love everything about it except for the print head. My first print head failed after only two months. It was under waranty so Canon tech support sent me a new print head free of charge. One month later, the print head failed again. Canon tech support sent me another new print head free of charge. After another two months, I needed another print head. Canon sent me a whole new unit to replace the original, again free of charge. Three months after that, the print head needed to be replaced again. My one year waranty runs out in just a few weeks and if the print head fails again I will be looking at buying another brand. Its a great unit if you can deal with the print head headache."
2,CANON..Forget the MP390..Bad News,"Having used for almost 2 years the printer failed and wont print anymore.From what I can gather, the purge unit or waste ink pads are faulty or need cleaning.Cost to fix is more than the MP390 price, so my advice is to stay clear of all Canon printers really.I used HP and Epson all my PC life(20 years) and found no problems with these, what a mistake it was buying this Canon MP390..they know about it as well, as they have been discontinued.Many people swear by Canon and some even SWEAR AT THEM !!..I am the latter.They much slower and quality no where near as good as HP and Epson..Other brands not sure of..Again..stay clear of these..Carl"
2,Canon MP390,I bought this printer and I loved it but it didn't last long. Not even two years. The part I would have needed was more thatn a new printer and when I went online there were more people that had the same problem. Canon claimed they had not heard about this problem before when I emailed them.
1,Canon MP 390 Printer,"I've always bought Canon, but this is the worst thing I've ever bought.In the middle of printing it just stops. The book says its hot, but how can it be hot on the first copy.I don't know how much ink and paper I've wasted on this thing, and its as slow as a snail also. Now it says the waste ink tank is full and you have to take it to a canon rep. to fix, which costs more than the machine is worth. I'm taking it to the hunting lease and putting it on the shooting range. Next time I won't be buying a Canon."
2,Ink Smears,"Great Printer but very cheap ink. Returned the printer only because the ink smears even with the slightest touch of the fingers. My old canon bjc-240 didn't have this problem. I don't understand why canon uses such cheap ink for an otherwise great printer. Scans great, printing looks sharp. But ink will inevitably smear when you handle the document. I wish someone mentioned this before I bought this printer. I eventually went with the Samsung SCX-4100 Laser Multifunction printer for cheaper price!"
2,A very poor printer,I have this printer for a bit over a year and it does not preform up to par. I only use it now and then not very offen. The paper constantly stuck. The print quality is poor. Use lots of ink. Ths scanner is also not good. I highly recommend not to waste your money on this.
2,Not problem free,"http://www.fixyourownprinter.com/forums/inkjet/32640#69A forum for people that have had problems with their canon. The printhead does seem to give up after a few months on some people, they are hard to get hold of and expensive, mine lasted 3 months problem free, after washing it out it lasted another 3 months but now needs replacing, for about the same cost as a new printer (not the same one of course). Apart from that the scanner and fax are great and when the printer was working it was fast and worked great."
4,A good buy,"A little slow before printing, a bit noisey, but printinglooks good and ink is cheap and so far is dependable, that'smore than I can say about my Epson. For the money I think it is a good buy."
3,I miss my laser!,"Our B/W laser needed a drum replacement so for the $200 we decided to get a new all-in-one. We debated about the cost of ink vs. toner, and also about the print quality. The ink does smear when moistened, and the quality is nothing as sharp as a laser. Plus, we replace the black ink more every 2-3 weeks! It's costing us about $50 extra per year to have only one machine, and it feels like a long wait for any new print job to start.Some minor faxing disappointments:- must scan pages one at a time- fax aborts if print request is sent- confusing setup to automatically allow voice & faxes (since you can't record an outgoing msg on the printer)It's a useful all-in-one, but we'll add a laser printer to better suit our day-to-day needs."
4,Great machine,"I had a MP5500 for 7 years and it still worked fine, thought I would try another canon with the MP390. Once you fine tune all the settings It is great to go. I recommend this product and for the price how can you go wrong."
2,bad,"I have had this all-in-one a short time and have had lots of problems getting it to print in color. At first, I thought I might have installed the printer software incorrectly, but I downloaded the updated driver from the web site and it still is not right. I was only able to successfully print out a doc with full color once. Usually, it print no color or partial color no matter what setting I use."
1,Don't buy this if you own a system with a VIA motherboard,"bought this one for my mom and while it's a nice printer, fax, etc it has one big problem: when i boot up her Shuttle XPC system (latest and greatest BIOS and all that), the system locks up completely due to some incompatibility. I've talked to Shuttle and Canon and they both acknowledge the problem, but have said that they're not going to change anything to fix it. They each suggested that I return the other's product! :)Anyway, I'm sending the printer back which is too bad, but I'm posting this as a word of caution to prospective owners."
2,Ink Dries Out Too Quickly,"Nice while it lasted. Good scanner, nice prints. Special printer head allows you to replace just the ink to save money. Unfortunately, the ink is wicked from some sort of absorbent material inside, like a magic marker, so there's not much of it as compared to a liquid ink well used on other printers. Works right after you replace it, then a few weeks later when you go to print - empty, dried out. Then after a few years - bam, the printer head goes bad and costs $50 to replace, bye bye savings. I don't recommend. Either go with an ink jet with the expensive liquid ink cartridges (like HP), or go with a color laserjet (expensive, but a lot of printing from a single set of cartridges). I switched to a Samsung laserjet (awesome) and never looked back :)"
1,"BEWARE, Cartridge permanently stuck..........",Worst printer ever had. Pictures are horrible when printed. Now the cartridge has locked in the corner and after researching many people had this issue. You can't just get to the cartridge without taking the entire printer apart.NICE!!!!Never will buy another Cannon.......Had about 2 years and don't even print that much...junk.Going with and EPSON ARTISIAN 810............Google mp-390 with cartridges getting stuck...Many of the exact same comments.....
1,Canon Multipass 390,DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER! It will die in 3 years. I called Canon tech support and we went through a series of checks. Turns out it is an internal problem with the only one option which is to take it to a repair center and pay $100.00 or more dollars for the repair. The stupid printer cost $100.00.Three years of use is not enough!
2,Died almost 3 years to the day...,I purchased mine in December 2004 and here it is 12/07/2007 and it just died. Mine started making the terrible grinding noise that most people hear and then the ink tanks just quit sliding back and forth. I have read about this in other sites on the web and it seems like a common problem. I liked the printer and scanner but for a printer to die after the light use I put it throuh is terrible.
3,High Volume users beware,"This is a good printer, but the ink cartridges are very small. At the standard setting, I needed a new ink cartridge after having printed less than 150 pages. That's pretty bad. On the other hand, the cartridges are inexpensive, so it may be that in the long run the overall cost of the printer comes out to be the same as other printers. Of course, you would have to keep accurate records and be able to compare with other printers to determine this (which I haven't)... In the end, the fact is that because I am a high volume user, I will have to buy lots of ink and change the cartridges often. Other than that, I have no complaints."
2,annoy the silence,"I have the 5 track CD Single which includes the Timo Maas Remix. The original 1990 remixes (Hands & Feet mix, Rikitiktik mix, etc) were exceptional. This 2004 rehash is just plain poor. In some cases a total stripping down and reworking of a song can work wonders for it and create a new audience for the artist as well some more cash for the record company but not in this case. The beauty of the song was the opening guitar hook which is almost absent here. Some things are better left untouched and that hook is one of them. This is still one of my favourite songs but I'd rather listen to the original mixes than these poor second cousins!Buy this only if you want to complete your DM collection!"
4,The Dutch Dictionary,"This book provides a fairly comprehensive translation of Dutch to English and English to Dutch. It provides some guidance on word usage and grammar. Be warned, however, because the book doesn't exactly provide any assistance in pronouncing any of the Dutch words. If you have spoken only English all your life, Dutch pronunciation can make your life interesting!"
1,only if you are real beginner,"Many important words and common expressions missing, makes it no so handy. For this price, better by the full version from Porto Editora.I wanted a pocket dictionary for work, and this one was a waste of my money."
3,Dutch/English Dictionary,"The book was received promptly and in excellent condition, however it is smaller than I expected which makes the writing very hard to read for someone with poor eyesight. However, I'm sure I'll manage with a magnifying sheet!"
1,How silly and vacous can a grown man be?,"I bought this book hoping to understand more about the circle of people who relates to the DNA problem; I found an author who thinks and talks like a l3 year old and has nothing to say..well yes a name is dropped here and there 2 sentences later he is off talking about something else, usually girls. What a waste of money this is unless you want to have nothing but contempt for scientists, but this is a very unrepresentive book and person to appreciate science..a silly 300 pages of drival. Those who wonder what his relationship with Franklin was might find interesting that initially in California he dreaded seeing her again, found her pleasant, pretended to do this and that to help her, but in reality skips off looking for girls! What a jerk! What a vacuous book, worse than one could ever imagine."
1,Nerdy scientists pursue young girls,"I was absolutely fascinated by The Double Helix, which I read years ago, so I eagerly anticipated reading this latest book by James Watson, which I proposed for my book club. Not one person liked it -- in fact, we all hated it -- and I was shocked that drivel like this could come from the same author and scientist who wrote the first book. More about his largely unsuccessful efforts to find a mate than about science, Watson's painfully self-conscious look at Scientists in Love was a total waste of time."
1,Self-Indulgence of a Famous Man,Badly-written and ludicrously self-indulgent on the part of the author; shamefully careless on the part of the editor.
3,"Sex, Drugs, Rock'n'Roll - and, oh yah, a Nobel Prize","Or, ""How Come Brainy Guys Can't Get Laid?""This is an amazing glimpse into the intellectual environment that nutured the truly revolutionary insite Watson and Crick achieved. It was perfect for a guy like Watson, except there weren't enough girls. Yes, if you still think Nobel Laureates are all noble, this book will help break you of that impression. You have to give the guy points for candidness. I don't know anybody else who has put so many failed conquests into print. And then the transition from lonely hunter to husband happens in the blink of an eye. So don't blink. The narrative sometimes reads like a Day Timer - you get the who, what, where. Dry. So, if you want to leave your scientists on a pedastal, leave this book on the shelf. If you are intrigued with finding out what it was like back then, you could give this one a spin."
3,No fireworks,"Watson's second book centres on the quest for the structure of RNA, whereas his first one 'The double Helix' told us the story of the discovery of the DNA helix.Readers of this work should have a solid knowledge of chemistry.It is however not as interesting as his first book and seems to have been written more as a memory for the insiders than for the common reader.It contains some indiscretions about Watson's more casual sexual encounters, together with his arduous search for a 'good' wife. But mainly, it's gossip about the scientific communities in England and the US in the 1950-1970's.All in all, it doesn't have the scientific and sexual fireworks of e.g., Erwin Schrödinger's biography by Walter Moore.Only for the friends and the aficionados."
1,if the big names of science mean something to you already,"I suspect that this book may be somewhat interesting if the ""big names"" of science during that era already mean something to you (the text is heavily littered with them). Apart from that it amounts to little more than the boring diary-like minutia-filled account of a few years in the life of a scientist after a major discovery, when nothing of great note subsequently happened. It is almost unheard of for me not to finish a book but I could not even make it to half way with this one."
5,Fast Shipping,I ordered this for my wife in the morning and the NEXT day it was here!What a great Vendor!!!
1,Bad Choice,"The Book: C for Linux Programming in 21 Days by Sam's is published in 2000. It is either so out of date, or inaccurate that even the first example (Hello World!), coding doesn't work. Even after following the instructions multiple times and double checking everything over. Warning their is a number of different downloads that have to be done to apply the information in these kinds of books that never get mentioned it is questionable if books like these serve any purpose other than coffee table decorations. Space too small to give lessons here. Buy only up to the minute beginning books. May things go well with you."
4,LOCMAN 1970 white,"BIG chunky cool italian automatic. Reliable 2824 mvmt. Fun to wear. Not a great choice for only watch, but I like having this baby in the collection. It gets a lot of attention. Crystal is vulnerable though. Mine cracked against stair handrail. Should be simple replacement."
2,"Missing the ""R"" key for some reason","I bought one of these from the store and took it home, and it was missing the ""R"" key. I figured it was just one of those anomalies and took it back and exchanged it for another one. This one was missing the ""R"" key as well. I was quite annoyed at this point. Why would a company make laptop computers that don't have an ""R"" key? So that people couldn't type MicRosoft? Kind of sneaky I think.I was hoping to write a fan letter to Fred Berry's estate, and needless to say it was difficult not being able to type ""Rerun"". I had to say ""Dwayne's buddy on What's Happening"" or something like that. I suppose some people could get by without an ""R"" key (like Bill Gates, that guy has so much money he could probably get by without ""V"" and ""L"" too), but not me. RRRRRRR!!!"
1,Salt mill zero stars would have my first choice,I purchased both the salt and pepper mill as a gift for my husband. The pepper mill works great but after a very short amount of time the salt mill stopped working properly. I have changed the batteries several times but it never seems to work right. Had I purchased it in person I would have returned it already. I'm online now to find out if I can exchange it.
2,Limited usability for this Mill,"I ended up returning this mill because it works with very limited types of salt. I tried Himalayan grinder salt, Celtic Sea Salt and and another grinder salt from Hawaii. The mill ground on and on and after a full minute, I had only about a quarter teaspoon or less. It's a great way to restrict the salt in your diet, but this isn't a good mill for general grinding."
4,Very Cool!,"These grinders are easy to use and so handsome. Makes seasoning a breeze since you just need one hand. The light comes one during the grinding process, so you can actually see how much you are using, which is very helpful at a candlelit dining table. Only drawback, it was difficult to assemble and hard to fit together. Some stores sell them assembled, so you might want to go that route. If it's a gift, you might want to do the recipient a favor and assemble them first and repackage."
1,Total rip off,This stuff is crap!!! It actually ruined my AC! It atleast was a little cold before i used this! Right after using it my air only blows hot!!! Couldnt even get my money back! I FEEL COMPLETELY ROBBED!!!
4,Love this series but a little let down with this one...,Daisy is book #5 in the Seven Brides series. I love this series but I have to say that Daisy is my least favorite so far. It wasn't bad but it just didn't measure up to the others. Neither Daisy nor Tyler has very much self-confidence. Both think they are unattractive & think that nobody will ever love them & then when they find that they love one another they still hold back for quite a while. Although this book was a little dull I highly recommend this series.
3,Annoying heroine,"This book was a little bit of a letdown for me. I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting, but whatever it was, I was disappointed. The hero, Tyler, was okay but Daisy was ten kinds of annoying. She had some rather odd hang-ups about freedom and thinking for herself and for some reason didn't believe Tyler would let her be herself even though he had never indicated otherwise. She kept lamenting the fact that her height would prevent her from ever getting married, and then, all of a sudden, out of the clear blue sky, she's engaged? It threw me for a loop and I started to wonder if perhaps I had missed something...apparently, something rather important...But overall, I still liked the story, I just had some trouble liking Daisy. Tyler was the redeeming character, in my opinion.This story contains graphic love scenes."
2,Not a great read,"I've read all of the seven brides series and find this one to be most disappointing. The heroine is just so self centered and annoying that it is impossible to read this book. I skipped many sections and could not make it to the conclusion. Daisy is beyond belief in her need to make her own decisions. This is true even when her life is threatened and the man she loves has done everything to win her love. She professes her love, but behaves in such a childish manner that it is more than this reader could take. What a complete waste of my money and my time. This author writes in the style of 80% what the characters are thinking and the rest actual dialogue. Now that is okay if the thinking is not just a continual rehash of the same thoughts. Tyler is a great character as are all the Randolphs, but the author could have done so much more with this story."
4,Good but not great,"This is a good addition to the saw, but when the saw is not in use, the extension when closed conlicts with the lock lever for the saw table extension and thus it does not go flush to the table top. As a working extension, it does the job well."
3,A little sloppy,"I bought a crosscut sled and this support does not support the weight of the sled. Really disappointed in that I will have to find a way to keep it up. It drops about 1/8"" and does not give me confidence in the sleds ability to give me accurate cuts."
5,Flawless,"the extention works great. Contrary to previous posters, I did not have any problems with the right side extention lever handle. I did adjust the lever tension some time before. I knew about the presumed flaw when I was buying it, but figured the extention was worth it. Even if you have to tweak the right side extention lever(and it's possible to do so), the extention is well worth it."
3,get what you pay for,"it's okay, but hey it's cheap. they should have just included it with the saw. one thing, i feel like the rest of the saw is pretty flawless in design (i'm no pro but it's a really easy saw to use/transport and gives a good cut to boot), so this thing just seems a bit out of place like an afterthought. again, for the money, worth getting for the few times you'll need it though."
2,Would be 5 stars if it actually fit my Bosch 4100 table saw :-(,"Bought this for my new Bosch 4100 table saw (new model released several weeks ago). Manual said that this TS1003 is compatible but after installing...or trying, found that it does *not* fit the 4100. Will be calling Bosch to see if they have a replacement part that has been redesigned to fit. Strange thing is that even the instruction sheet that shipped with the TS1003 said that it fits both 4000 and 4100 model saws."
3,Left Side support critique,"If you need an Left Side support for your Bosch table saw, this is it. There are not really any other alternatives.The design looks pretty good and the price is reasonable. The problem is in the manufacturing. Tolerances are WAY out of line.In order for this accessory to be usable, expect to drill & tap new 1/4-20 holes for the friction clamps, then order new 1/4-20 thumb screws to replace the ridiculously tiny (and VERY loose) screws that came with the unit.If you do this, the Left Side support will function well.These issues are not what you expect for a tool with the Bosch name on it, not even close.Dan"
2,Not Designed Correctly,"Although Bosch claims this extension works with the 4100, it has a problem. Both screws from the left bracket(the one with the longer rod) cannot be screwed in because the curve of the body of the saw blocks it. So you either use one screw which causes the left side to bend with any eight, or you need to machine a hole yourself."
3,Unfortunately they sag :(,"I had to give these 3 stars for one simple reason. They sag. So you have to pick... Do you want them perfectly level when closed, or perfectly level when extended. The reason they sag is because the holes in the rails which bolt to the saw appear to be oversized. So you have some play in the rods which slide in/out. Also, this prevents them from sliding smoothly.I use a incra 1000 miter gauge with a 31"" telescoping fence. Since the rails have too much play, it was frustrating to use the adjustable fence since I always had to tweak the rails to support the fenceIf they just removed the slop, these extension rails would be great."
1,Worthless Product,"It's hard to believe that this product is made by Bosch. The table saw is fantastic, yet Bosch seemed to produce this part with virtually no thought. It sags significantly, hence, what's the point... you need to keep the wood flush to the table saw, so the extension isn't even in use.The worst part is that it barely extends outward. It doesn't extend nearly as far as the other side of the table, so you're better off just moving the board to the right side of the table.Do not waste your money on this product!"
1,bad design,"great idea , bad designextension wont slide in the last 6 inches because it hits tne rip fence lockyou have to unlock the fence , slide in the extension, then lock the fence against the extensions barso much for German engineering"
3,OK but...,"Helpful addition to the table, fairly easy to install, but the extension is about 1/16"" lower than the table, so it does not support perfectly horizontally a long piece of wood affecting your cut unless you hold it down, negating the main benefit of the extension."
4,Bosch Table Saw Left Side Support Extension,"The left side outfeed support extension works beautifully. Installation was slightly difficult due to the location of the mounting screws. The extension is easy to move in and out, sliding in the mounts.It is simple to use and works well."
2,Theoretical Basis for Nursing,"The book was too ""wordy"". It used a lot of words to say the same thing over and over, to perhaps fill pages for a publisher."
4,satisfaction.,I received the book on time and the condition was even better than expected. Thank you!
1,"Index is poor, poor, poor.","Nice text; well-written, but the ridiculous index makes this somewhat of a joke. Whoever wrote the index (looks author-generated?) doesn't know the purpose/function of an index."
4,"not the best, but good for a general understanding","This is a great book as a quick review and by using this book as your sole review source you could probably answer many questions of the test, but dont expect to ace it! This book is good (but not great) on many chapters specially on developement and psychopathology (enough to get the big clinical picture), but it is very weak on biostats. So if your looking for biostats, go look somewhere else! If you want to study from the best source there is, there's not much left... try kaplan notes and lectures wich I found best..4 Stars for all the vital details I consider this book is lacking.. but stillit is an outstanding of review."
3,Good book with a high price,"The book is really thin, but cost more than 10 dollars even it is not new.But the content is good, if you have FA, I donot suggest you to buy this one."
4,easy read,I bought this book for my class and found it to be easy to read and very informative. The book arrived in perfect condition although purchased used.
5,Gideon Tuba Warrior,This is an excellent example of the best of Veggie Tales. This is one of my 2 yr old's favorite Veggie Tales. The story is pretty accurate (considering it is being told to preschool children using fruits and vegetables). The music is fun; my little one always gets up and dances when the music plays. The message of trusting in God comes through loud and clear. I also really loved this tale as well. A definite must if you (or your kids) like Veggie Tales.
4,Nanagirl,I have gotten several other veggie tales for my grandson and seeing I don't have a car I cannot always go to the store when I want to to buy things I am very pleased to be able to get these at a reasonable price and I don't have the hassle of needing to fine a ride
1,I didnt get the story,All I saw was a green dude with a tuba and him talking about god. i just don't get this. Don't buy this. kids will hate it. trust me. i am.
3,A little long in the tooth!,"This album is a step down from ""Have Another Beer With FEAR"". The music is still there, but the lyrics are lame. There is not a single cuss-word on the whole CD! There is one place where he would have said the f-word, but he censors himself so that it sounds like the word was removed! Perfect for the whole middle-class, yuppie family!"
4,Excellent for moms on the go!,"I love this product too bad they didn't have this with my last two kids. I use to order this from another company, but it is cheaper through Amazon and being a Prime member just makes it all worthwhile. I LOOOOOOve not having to go the store to make big purchases."
4,Enfamil Powder Single Serving,"This is a very convenient product. However, the only reason why I give it 4 stars is because you can only mix in 4 or 8 oz increments. My child is currently drinking 6oz."
1,Beware of the lamp,"This TV has a great picture, however, if you choose to purchase any projection television, count on replacing the lamp every year. Lamps run anywhere from $112 - $175. I am currently on my third lamp. The last lamp I purchased on 01/12/10 and it burned out this past weekend. Also, make sure to buy a Phillips bulb. Other brands will burn out much faster."
4,Two Sides Now - by Misty Mallory,"The words of this book spring from the pages and into one'svery soul, filling it with awe and compassion for this beautiful youngspirit. Every poem provides a new insight to both the world around usand the world inside of us.If I could change but one aspect of this book, it would be that the author could be here to share more of her poetic wisdom with those of us still trying to find our ""two sides"" in this very much one-sided world."
4,A fine first--and last--book,"The death of Misty Mallory tore a hole through Southern California's poetry community. Few people really knew her--most new her father, poet Lee Mallory--but the death of a young person always reverberates. ""Two Sides Now,"" a collection of poems, is fascinating, not only because it provides slight foreshadowings to her passing, but because it presents a poetic voice of much greater potential that is never realized. The book is pastoral and spiritual, and startling in the clarity of it's vision. It is certainly a book woth reading, and worth reading with close attention."
1,Postmortem / Body of Evidence / All that remains,I ordered this book and only recieve Postmortem. I am upset that I did not get this book because now if I want to continue I now have to buy one book at a time.
1,If you've read one you've read 'em all,They are all the same and all end the same. I got so tired of poor Dr. Kay being stalked by the bad guy that you've never heard about until the last 20 pages. Write something original Patricia and leave the formula writing to the romance novelists!!!!
4,Terrific!,"I don't know why everyone says that body of evidence & all that remains aren't as good as postmortem. They're different books, approached with a different manner with the only similarities being the characters. All three books are wonderful, and I couldn't stop till i went through the whole book!"
4,Review of Oppenheim's Letters,"Here is an extensive, readable collection of letters from ancient mesopotamia. The translator offers about 80 pages of introduction, most of which is interesting and helpful."
3,Mixed bag,"Whilst there are undoubtedly some good tracks on this album i don't really know how flex can call this a mix tape , there is no mixing or scratching like there was on his first 3 mix vol's. This is more like his last cd ""the tunnel"" which had tracks by flex with guest artists , well this is really what that was. All the tracks bar one were made for this cd and feature flex himself. That said if you are just interested in the tracks then there are some good efforts here , mainly the single do you and ante up with busta rhymes. Also worth a mention are the tracks by eminem and faith evans. The album does tail off badly towards the end with some mediocre tracks but there should be enough on here to please most people , but just do'nt expect any mixing."
2,CAN I GO BACK TO THE TUNNEL??,"This album is more like a mixtape than any of Flex's other efforts. I usually dont like mixtapes. Its impossible to get the best artists to give up quality tracks that you know they need for thier own albums. by this time, dj clue is annoying everybody with the shout outs in the background so thank goodness flex is better than that. other than a few songs mentioned by dmx, jadakiss and faith i found no reason to play this album over again. this prompts me to ask, Can we go back to the tunnel?? That has some of the best representation of 99-00 hip hop anywhere!"
5,off the chain,"Opening the cd and hearing that Dr Dre beat let me know this is some tight sh@t. Dmx and MOP are okay. The bright spots are Nature, Nelly, Shyne, Saukrates, Lady Luck and CNN. Nature flows over a tight beat. Eminem and D-12 has me waiting for their Cd to drop. Jadakiss has it lock for his Cd to drop. So cop this right cha. You heard. one."
4,"Fantastic in some places, boring in others, but worth buying","The only reason I picked this disc up was because of the remix of ""Ante Up"" by MOP. I looked at the rest of the featured artists and thought it would be a soild addition to my collection. And I was right. It wasn't very consistent though. One minute I'd be hearing DMX and Ja Rule, the next minute I would hear In Essence, who I had never heard before and didn't dig that much. But the harder tracks more than make up for the weak ones. Pick it up."
2,"Not as good as vols 1, 2, 3","Flex gets commercial on this latest mixtape............in fact, this to me ain't a mixtape at all. Where's the scratchin'? Where's the shouts? On previous mixtapes, Flex would take it back to the old school..........that's not in this album at all. Expect for Ante Up remix and Goodlife, this album is just average. If you listen to his first three mixtapes (classics, might I add), you'll see what I'm talking about."
3,'Just Bought It',"I just bought this album from the shop, and i was attracted to it because it the 'Ante Up' Remix in it. I have had a quick glance through the album and the intro sounds pretty good, other hits on it is 'Come Over' Feat. Nelly, ""Did She Say "" So So Def with Lil' Bow Wow. I have a feeling that when i really get into this album their will be bad songs and good songs but hopefully the good songs will make up for the bad ones. But who knows."
4,THIS ALBUM IS DOPE!,"IVE ALWAYS BEEN A FLEX FAN, SO NATURALLY I COPPED THE ALBUM... THE ANTE UP REMIX, IS BANANAS, AND THE NELLY JOINT IS CRAZY.. ONE JOINT THAT I PARTICULARLY LIKED WAS THE JA, AND DA MURDERERS SONG. THE TRACK IS SICK, AND THEM FELLAS REALLY SOUND TIGHT ON IT. I DONT KNOW WHO THE PRODUCERS ARE, BUT THEY NEED TO BLESS SUM OTHER HIP HOP ACTS WITH TRACKS LIKE THAT!"
2,"maybe 3 good songs, too much chatter","If Flex didnt talk away between every song, this CD would be much easier to take. During Shyne's track, Flex is actually running his mouth OVERTOP of Shyne's vocals, so you cant even hear the second half of Shyne's performance! What's the matter flex, worried someone might forget for 30 seconds were not listening to Funk Flex Vol.4?...With the exception of 3 maybe 4 decent tracks, this CD just isn't good. This isn't worth the time."
1,Very disappointing,"I love Dan Simmons' other books, but this one was slow and boring - if I'd read this one first I would never have read any of his other works. Dont waste your time with this one, go read his other books."
3,Not what I expected,"This is not the sort of novel I expected from Dan Simmons. Its slow. Its melancholy. About the best you can say is that its about a guy, a middle-aged guy who does some suff. And that's it. But of course I couldn't put it down. This is Dan Simmons godammit! I kept waiting for the payoff, waiting for some sort of portal to open spewing forth a robotic demon-spawn killing machine travelling backwards in time from the future. But that never happened. Reading this book was like going to a Marilyn Manson concert but getting four hours of Kenny G instead. Still, it was wonderfully written, but I can only hope Mr Simmons has gotten this bit of middle-aged angst out of his system and will focus on what he does well... robot demon spawn!!"
4,You might like it,"If you are troubled by killing an animal, whether by accident, such as a spider in a bathtub or a squirrel on the road, or whether on purpose, such as slaughtering a lamb or hunting a deer or hooking a fish, then you will probably like this book very much.Kimber analyzes the hunting paradox and many related concepts-sport verses food hunting, subsistence hunting/gathering verses husbandry, the wild verses the domesticated-in this thoughtful, well-written book. By pulling in the writings of many other authors, Kimber analyzes them in his own insightful way. The result is often rambling and slightly disjointed, but always thought provoking. Answers are not concise, clear, or black-and-white, because there really aren't such answers.Regardless of whether you like this book, you will no doubt like Kimber, his lifestyle, and his honesty. I highly recommend his other books Upcountry: Reflections from a Rural Life and Made for the Country."
5,Practical and Essential for ESL students,"Being an ESL student myself, I know how hard it is to become familiar with idioms. How to use them, when to use them, and why... This book gives you practical answers on the use of British and American English idioms. It sometimes even gives some background information. It is easy to use and certainly worth your money!"
4,Best present,I gave this toy as a present to a 6yr old boy and he called me the next day to tell me how happy he was with it and to confirm that this was the best gift he had received. Great value!!
1,"spark plug rebate, no rebate.",bought spark plugs with the promise of a rebate or refund with each one. so far have not recieved a rebate
1,"Used to be good, now it's just awful",My wife and I started a tradition years ago where we would make Boboli pizza's and rent a movie every weekend. The boboli crusts that used to be so good have progressively become worse and worse the last couple of years. What used to be a thick but light crust with lots of cheese on it has become a blob of almost uncooked dough with only a couple specks of cheese. They seem to keep changing the recipe and each time it gets worse. It's definitely time for a new tradition!!!
1,Just Bad - Not One Redeeming Quality,"I was a kid when Boboli was first introduced (at least to the local market). Yet somehow decades passed and I never tried them. So this weekend when I had some leftover cheese and sauce from a pasta dinner, and saw these in the market, I thought, ""perfect"".The experience was anything but.I don't know what these are supposed to taste like, but I found them to be just awful. Once cooked, they're thick and doughy. Nothing at all like actual pizza crust. Not NY Style, Chicago style or California. Worse still, they have this god awful rancid oil taste. Like used, dirty oil from a cheap take out place.Needless to say, I will not be using the 2nd one that came in the package. Nor will I be purchasing these again."
3,Great quality but a few functional problems,"This was a fabulous camcorder quality wise. But it is VERY difficult to connect it to the computer. You must ""finalize"" the disc to import the video on the computer, and then if you want to use that disc again you must ""format"" the disc which deletes all the videos on the disc. And if you want to delete some videos on the disc, you have to press all these buttons to get to a list of options, where you see the option you want, but it is grayed out. Or at least in my case. It has fantastic quality and works well and it has fairly simple buttons and the touch screen is mediocre."
1,Incompatible with vista,"I am eager to be proven wrong, but after a few hours of trying to get this data to work with my vista computer (and spending time on the sony support web site, which is a fairly painful and garbage site, which insisted this was compatible), the support team admitted it was not possible to use the usb cable to download info.Now I am sure the camera is great as the other reviews say, but I had hoped to easily edit this via my computer. More than that, as I look at the sony marketing material, no where does it say there is this lack of a vista driver, and if fact it indicates it is supported. I am rapidly losing faith in Sony products - my psp, this, others are all almost impossible to easily sync with my vista computer (and xp one generally as well frankly). And sony's online support offering is negligible and painful"
1,Disappointed with Amazon product,"Honestly, I am quite sure that this is a fine product. However, the one I received from Amazon would not charge. After speaking with Sony about the issue, they determined it was an issue with the camera itself. So, Amazon sent me a replacement model. This one also would not charge or turn on. I ended up sending it back for a refund. I heard through a camera shop I spoke with about the camera that amazon sells ""gray market"" or refurbished electronics that are not covered under the Sony warranty in the US. I have always had a good experience with Amazon before, but I will not be purchasing electronics through this company anymore!"
4,DCR-DVD408 DVD Camcorder Review,"I previously owned a later generation Sony DVD Handycam (DCR-DVD405) and decided to stick with Sony after reviewing their new product line, as well as what their competitors had to offer. This new camera does not disappoint."
3,Close but no cigar!!,"My 20 month old daughter adores Pooh, so I thought she would love having this bear. Unfortunately, because it is the ""classic"" Pooh, she did not take to him like I wanted her to. I will try to find a small red t-shirt to put on him. Other than that, this bear is very nice. He is extremely soft and an excellent quality stuffed animal."
3,One time use only,These beautiful yet repetitive designs are easy to iron onto white or very light material. The designs wash out in one or two washes. They are not reusable. Many designs do not have fairies or butterflies but have dragons and talons. There are many round shaped Celtic designs that are stunning and feminine. My kids and I as a homeschool project decorated pillow cases and shirts with friends for a craft.
4,Heartwarming,"An enjoyable, feel-good, easy read with some very funny dialogue. The relationship between Agnes and Marion was refreshing. I was a little disappointed with the somewhat ""forced"" ending between Agnes and Cliff, though."
3,Above average Irish Tale,I finally have read this book everyone has raved about. I found this to be an above average Irish tale. It was much more hopeful and humorous than Angela's Ashes. I was put off by the crude language though.It did read like a movie script with some of the humorous scenes obvious. There was heart that I didn't expect. Agnes is a refreshing character who is interesting to follow.You will enjoy this book.
5,Delightful story balancing sorrow with joy,"The Mammy is an eloquently written story about a family in Dublin, Ireland. The book is entertaining and moving. It is lighthearted at times and at other times it deals with serious matters such as death, sickness and religion. There are several laugh-out-loud moments when the author brilliantly captures the closeness of friends who share tragedy and exhiliration. The several children in the story offer a spectrum of personalities and clash and interact entertainingly. The story is full of wit and insight into human behavior, especially the love between mother and children.I have given this book and its sequels as gifts to the delight of several friends. And I recommend it for you."
5,The Mammy by Brendan O' Carroll,"I got this book today, i started reading today 11/09/2012 and finished it 12/09/2012, what a story some of reminded me of my own childhood, Great story and well written,some really funny parts and some really sad parts. I look forward to the next installment The Chisellers and The Granny, I am a really big fan of Agnes Brown. I would without a doubt recommend this bookThe Mammyto everyone to read. Well done to Brendan 0' Carroll."
5,The Mammy,"Loved this book. Fast and easy reading, although had to look up some of the slang Irish words. LOLThe Mammy is book 1 of a trilogy ,looking forward to reading Chisllers and ""The Granny""."
2,Neither witty nor funny....just silly.,"I loved 'Angela's Ashes' and I wanted to like this book. The four and a half star reviews and the wonderful book cover gave me the impression that this book is witty and charming. Unfortunately, it is neither. I just found it downright silly. Could not get past Chapter 3."
3,"Fun read, not to be confused with ""Angela's Ashes""","This book was a simple book,a feel good book, about a family facing difficult times. The situations inevitably work out for the Brownes, this is a work of fiction, and you feel good for them as a result. There is no heavy lifting here and this book should not be confused with the work of Seamus Deane, Frank McCourt or Roddy Doyle for that matter, however it does make for some fun summer reading."
1,Could put it down,"I have rarely not finished a book (that I chose!). I'm an English teacher/English major; I constantly read a very wide variety of books, various authors, different subject matter, points of view, and settings. Yes, I read Frank McCourt's (and this doesn't even compare). I can't remember of the last 35 books I've read in the last year in a half that I didn't finish reading a book. This was THE one. I tried, but I couldn't force myself to finish it. It was not what I expected or as the mostly positive reviews suggested, at least for me. I didn't find it funny (mostly unbelievable characterization), and I really couldn't find a plot in it. I didn't come to care about Mammy or her brood. Sorry; I won't be reading the follow-ups."
3,very pleasant read,"The trilogy is amusing and believable. However, the three books combined equal in all manner one book. I was driven to purchase all three because I truly enjoyed Agnes and her brood but retain the resentment that I spent in excess of $30.00 for the feed. Clever of O'Carroll and his biz associates to spread the story into three volumes, more filthy lucre for them all but so transparent is the plan, so thin the books they too fall just short of being transparent."
3,Quaint Walk Down An Irish Lane,"At times the humor felt forced, the first chapter especially. Yet, by mid book, I was laughing along side the girls as if I was taking the driving instruction myself. The ending was too contrived. I longed for a little less fantasy. Over all, it was an easy read, and entertaining."
4,"Part gritty memoir, part fairy tale.","Brendan O'Carroll plainly states Agnes Browne is not his mother. (His own mother's story is colorful and unbelievable enough, it should be his next big project.) But he paints her so affectionately, you can't help but see him in the character of Agnes' oldest son, Mark. Growing up in Dublin in the sixties, he distills those times and informs the day to day existence of his street dealers, turf vendors, office workers, publicans and school children. Part gritty memoir, and part fairy tale, this is only one sweet part of his Dublin trilogy. If only The Chisellers and The Granny were available here in the US! I'm hooked!"
5,I want a hard cover for my library!,"Absolutely fabulous work! I picked this book up at the airport on one of my business trip and could not put it down. If you want learn to appriciate lives outside the USA fishbowl, you ought to read this book. If you don't want to poison your mind with harsh reality then don't bother."
4,You'll fall in love with the Browne Family,"O'Carroll brings you a heartwarming tale about Agnes and her family. You will laugh and cry and want to know more about everyone she comes in contact with. Reading this book alone will not be enough you'll want to run out and get The Chisellers and Granny. This is not a complex read but you do have to remember all of the children and there individual characteristics. Just so you can tell the boys apart. Agnes is a great mother and has dealt w/a lot including a ""mean"" nun and a mushy cucumber. You'll laugh. You'll cry. But you'll keep going back for more."
3,The Mammy,"quick read, witty old fashioned story about an immigrant family's life starting out in America after the loss of her husband"
5,No pity party here!,"The Mammy is simply delightful! Agnes Browne is a woman that we could all learn from.As you read The Mammy, you can invision how poor the Browne family was, but it was as if they didn't know it. They are a family as full of laughter as they are determination and strength. A woman, left widowed with 7 children, is rarely a character that would bring you to laugh aloud when reading in public. What is even more striking is the author (a male)could have so much insight as to how women think.Agnes Browne is a heroine. She taught her children love. She taught her children pride. She taught her children that no matter what they are a family and that NOTHING could come between Agnes Browne and her children.I couldn't wait to get The Chisellers and The Granny! Equally as good as the first book!"
4,Not too bad,"I have a Nikon D60 and a 70-300mm F4-5.6 AF-s VRII lens. Not being able to purchase Nikons 4-600mm lenses ($2,500-10,000)but needing a little longer reach for surf and bird photography I chose to try this Tele-converter.The auto-focus works ok in bright light, the VR works too, to my surprise, unfortunately image quality is not top notch but well enough that most photos come out pretty good. Exif data does not show the extra length of the lens, 300mm to 620mm.I have learned that shutter priority is best and let the camera control aperture. F8,9,10,11 being the best. I took photos at a canoe race today from shore and got pretty descent shots. The Kenko pro 1.4 supposedly the same as this Tamron just different names. I do recommend this if you need longer reach but can't afford Nikons high end lenses. [...]"
4,Good Rodeo and Sports teleconverter,"This converter works well with the Tamron 70-200mm f2.8 on a Nikon D700 body. So far I have used it for a rodeo shoot where it gives me a bit of boost in the telephoto without losing much light. The result is f4 wide open at 280 mm. I was shooting at ISO 1600 which is not particularly noisy on a D700. Aperture reports itself as adjusted; when the lens is f2.8 I see f4 in the finder. Autofocus works just fine. It is reasonably sharp, certainly good enough for sports, but you must use it with a lens having ""spare"" sharpness since you are magnifying the center of the image.The Nikon SP model came in black which I like better than a bright white ring when everything else is black."
1,Not ready for prime time,I was very displeased with and returned the Tamron 1.4 teleconverter. Even in bright light and coupled with a Tamron 18-270mm lenses it had a hard time focusing and then holding focus.
1,BUY WITH CAUTION,"I have a Nikon D300 with a 70-200/f2.8 lens. I purchased a Tamron teleconverter since I can't afford a bigger lens. I tried my Tamron teleconverter with the f2.8 lens, and the lens would not autofocus or do any adjustments at all. I thought maybe it was the lens, so I switched to my Nikon 70-300 lens, and again, the lens no longer responded. Perhaps Tamron teleconverters only work with Tamron lenses, but my suspicion is in the teleconverter. Why do I say this? Well, it may be nothing, but all my Nikon lenses have 10 little nubs on the lens where it attaches to the camera body. But the Tamron teleconverter only has 8 nubs. So I suspect this is where the problem lies. My advice: save your pennies and buy a Nikon Teleconverter if you are shooting a professional DSLR."
4,Fascinating Information,"This book takes the reader on a tour of monasteries throughout the world.... Christian, Buddhist, Muslim, Hindi, Jain, etc.. The author spent retreat time in all of these settings, and in most of them he was also able to interview residents also. The information presented is fascinating and reads very easily. The use of photographs to illustrate the text was an added bonus!"
3,Arrived in a broken case,"The instrument works very well to help me get my guns on the paper. Unfortunately the case arrived with a broken snap, not the end of the world, but the lack of response from Bushnell was disappointing"
3,"Good for a general idea, but not precise","This item is OK if all you want to get on paper as far as windage goes. There is NO guarantee you won't be high or low. It assumes your scope is a certain distance above the barrel. Assume the rifle and scope are exactly level. If the scope is higher than the center of the boresite, it will show your crosshairs above center. If lower, the crosshairs will be below. So, if your scope is high, and you adjust the crosshairs to be on target, you could be hitting the ground. But at least you won't be shooting the target next to yours.The boresite is also good if you can't find Laser sites for your caliber. I have a 6.8 SPC, and forget finding a laser for it. This worked to get me lined up on paper at 25 yds. Once I got the elevation ok ( was about a foot low ) was good."
4,boresighter,This is a nice product and works exacly like it says it does I would recommend this product. I like using it because it is simple and effective.
5,Can't beat it.,"I used this for seven years while working in gun shop and always heard good things from my customers about it. Used it on several of my guns and in some cases, didn't even have to zero after boresighting. A must have for rifle shooters."
4,Boresighter,I bought this to use for setting a scope on top of the carry handle on my AR15. I found out the hard way that this will not work for doing this. The scope is too high above the barrel when used on the carry handle. This is not a fault of the boresighter just my own mistake. It is a very nice kit with a number of different arbors and if you have a AR 15 with a flat top upper then this will work well for you.
3,Does not work with pistol iron sights,"While the Bushnell instructions say it works with pistol Iron sights, there is no way to use this on a pistol that has no scope. It sits way too high to adjust the pistol sights."
1,Does not work,this item does not work on an AR 15. that would have been nice to know because that's the reason why I bought it
2,Does not work with high mounted scopes.,This product is not adjustable for my AR15 with the scope mounted as is. It is too low to be seen through the scope. Other than that it might have been a decent product. Just would've been nice to know beforehand.
2,This single's value is dubious.,"This single is really a collector's item for hardcore Pearl Jam fans. If you are not a hardcore Pearl Jam collector and want any of the above songs, I strongly suggest that you get ""Binaural"" and/or one of 72 official Pearl Jam bootlegs. Of course, both live songs here are great versions, but they are not so strikingly good that everyone must own them.As a side note, the same two live songs were featured on the import edition of Binaural, so if you have a lot of money to spend on Pearl Jam memorabilia, you might as well try to find that one instead of buying this."
5,Enough to whet the whistle (for a little while anyway!),"Pearl Jam does it again. These guys are amazingly eclectic and continue to thrill and impress. If these two songs are a prelude to what is to come, then Binaural will be an amazing album. I can't wait."
3,"Good, but not the best we've heard from Pearl Jam","Well, so far we've heard 4 songs off the new album: Nothing As It Seems and Insignificance from this single release, Thin Air during their Bridge Benefit shows last October, and Grievance on Letterman last week. Judging by these 4 songs, Binaural is going to be one of the less memorable Pearl Jam albums. Sure, I enjoy all 4 of these songs, which I find catchy (especially Grievance), but I am a huge fan of Pearl Jam, and I enjoy almost all of their music. I don't think that these songs are nearly as good as their best known material, and as a result, I think that casual fans will be dissapointed by the album. Of course, I am reviewing the album after hearing only 4/13 songs, and its very possible that I'm very wrong (as I hope). I guess we'll just have to wait and see."
1,seek no value in it,"I am a physician, and I bought this CD hoping it would contain some up to date information on shoulder injuries and rehabilitation. The CD is just a collection of PDF files of general health articles, lists of abstracts, and assorted web search results. A small fraction of the content is related to the shoulder, and virtually none of it is useful. The rest is loosely related or unrelated. Seek no value in it."
5,Quick,Book was in great shape and mailed out quickly. The pages of the book were not worn or written on.
4,NO FRILLS Collection of Flute STUDIES (For Grade 2) - 5 star material & pricing SANS the gloss,"Melodious and Progressive Studies Book 1 arranged by Robert Cavally.For flute. Woodwind Solos & Ensembles - Flute Studies.From Andersen, Gariboldi, Koehler and Terschak. Instructional and Studies.Grade 2 - BUT LOOKS A LOT HARDER than today's books eg Paul Harris' 76 Graded Studies for Flute (Grades 1-5)!Collection. 64 pages.If you want value, this is GREAT VALUE - jam packed with studies - literally. For the self motivated and already inspired!Not in keeping with today's glossy trends with accompanying discussion notes - nevertheless - a classic std."
4,A collection of Salish and Skagit legends,"A collection of 34 legends of the Coast Salish and Skagit Indians. Each story averages about three pages with drawings, sketches and maps throughout."
2,A not-too-bad book,"Not much to say than if you like this book check out Nigel Bennett's books with P.N. Elrod, Keeper of the King His Father's Son and Siege Perilous"
2,I wish I had passed this one by,"The book is as bland as a soup made from water and skim milk. Dracula simply doesn't live here. The monstrous, yet charismatic creature that Bram Stoker wrote about is not the same fellow in these stories. I was not happy."
5,16 stories made JUST for this collection...,"I am a vampire fan and when I found out about this book I have to get it. With such authors as Tanya Huff, Fred Saberhagen, P.N. Elrod and K.B. Bogen, this book is full of great works of the craft. Filled with humor and horror, it has something for anybody.And if you like somebody's work you can always use the information in the back of the book to find their other works. A must for any vampire library!"
2,Disappointing...,"As a psychology intern co-leading several groups, I had hoped for an insightful guide to the dynamics of co-leading and ways of conceptualizing our role with the group. This book is essentially a long review of a small survey and a few chapters based on casual interviews. The chapter with Virginia Satir is the most substantial but there are much better places to find her ideas. I suggest looking elsewhere for insights into co-leading groups."
4,easy instruction,"The last 2 chapters may come in handy over the years, but the first 3/4 of the book are excellent"
5,Awsome,For a modern approach there is no one better than Radencich. To tie with such perfection; its great to see he is sharing his secrets.
5,awesome,"This DVD was awesome, I saw it for the first time at a church men's Retreat in pine valley, Utah. Loved it had to order it to watch with my wife and its just a must own"
5,The Best Young Adult Ever,"Despite being an adult I enjoy reading young adult novels, especially Terry Pratchett. The Wee Free Men is the best one I've ever read, a title it usurped from Pratchett's The Amazing Maurice And His Educated Rodents. I don't care what genre someone writes in when they can WRITE! Like Heinlein in SF, Rex Stout in mysteries, Georgette Heyer in Regency Romance; Terry Pratchett is the best at what he does. And there is no second place."
5,Excellent series,"I absolutely tore through this series. I actually didn't realized it was geared towards ""young adults"" until after I purchased the first book. However, mush like the Harry Potter series, it is an outstanding read for adults as well. While it's not my favorite Pratchett book, the entire series was well done, with great characters that you wanted to see grow. Definitely recommended!"
4,A good dream with in a dream book,"Really enjoyed the book, interesting how one dream can become intwined into another dream. It was almost real. My dreams are somethimes like that and it is confusing."
5,Wonderful,"Well, If you love Terry Pratchette you will love tiffany, She is on Disc world but has her own place on it. I get lost in her adventures and those Picts, It as expected is great. Good clean and a bit sassy fun fantacy."
5,This is magic,Magic and the world of witchcraft was never so vividly and wonderfully painted by anyone else. This book perfectly gives the reader a taste of Prachetts amazing way of making magic seem very believable.This book is filled with surreal imagery and mind bending plot twists. A great read with no prior knowledge of the discworld required.This is about learning what you are and where you belong. It's about magic and dreams and sheep.And I forgot to mention the Wee Men. One of Pratchett's most entertaining creations.
5,Stand off,"I waited a long time to read this book. I love Terry Pratchett and I thought . . . ""A children's book I shant like it! He'll have to simplify!"" But I was wrong, silly me I should have known better. If you already like Terry Pratchett there is nothing not to like here. If you are new to Terry Pratchett and Discworld, this isn't a bad place to start. You wont be too confused and you'll get in on the fun. Plus, if you don't like the wee free men your crazy! My inner monologue has not yet recovered. Crivens!"
5,"Definitely NOT ""baby - preschool"" whtever Amazon says!","Terry Pratchett does not dumb down his books for children, so they are all also great reads for adults. WFM is no exception. OK, the Nac Mac Feegle have had some of their language simplified since Carpe Jugulum but that is about as far as any dumbing down goes.Somehow, rather than thinking of this as a children's Discworld book, I can't help feeling that it is actually just another book in the series which is based in an area of the Disc which hasn't been used before. It must be fairly close to Bad Ass and Lancre because Nanny Ogg and Granny Weatherwax appear at the end but otherwise it is a new bit of the Disc which PTerry hasn't brought to our notice in the past.Tiffany is suitably ""witchy"" and has proper family values (i.e. she doesn't like her brother but he's *her* brother!). Miss Tick is suitably out of place on the Chalk.Great book, great story, hope the character appear again!"
4,Whole family enjoyed this book,"My husband bought this book because our family is always looking for a new series which we can all read & enjoy together. WE travel alot so listened to it on the iPOD first. Our sons (14 & 12) enjoyed it. The story of Tiffany Aching & her Little blue friends has plenty of adventure while still getting the point across that all your choices have consequences. It is nice to have the protagonist be a self sufficient girl & yet there is none of the male bashing that seems to be so prevalent now. Tiffany soon realizes that being a witch isn't easy, in fact it seems like a lot of everyday Hard work. Granny Aching is one of my favorite characters simply because she was such an important part of Tffany's life. However, like many of us Tiffany didn't realize this until Granny was gone. We have already purchased the next 2 books & really hope Mr. Pratchett will continue woth Tiffany's aadventures as she grows up!!"
4,Watch out for the Nac Mac Feegle,"Aching sets out to find her younger brother. But she is not alone. Accompanying her is a band of pictsies, the Nac Mac Feegle, little blue men who love to drink, steal and fight. Together, they will travel to Fairyland to confront the Queen and rescue both Tiffany's brother and the son of the local Baron. Along the way Tiffany discovers that she has special insights, and comes to understand her destiny, filling the shoes of her late Granny Aching.A fun fantasy, with a smattering of silly and amusing scenes, this book also provides a bit of social commentary, but is mostly just good entertainment."
3,Not as good as the hype...,"This was certainly no Harry Potter. It was a cute little story, mind you, but I don't think it was as fabulous as the reviews lead you to believe.I was very excited when I got it. I love fairy tales, and the idea that this one centered on a female witch was refreshing. But, unfortunately, the plot was oversimplified. Brother is stolen. Take a trip to get brother back. There were no subplots, and I went through the majority of the book just waiting for Tiffany to actually Get somewhere. Don't get me wrong. The characters are great (though the dialogue of the Wee Free men was sometimes difficult to figure out) and the ideas were great. I just don't think the whole thing was very well executed. A good, solid fairy tale for kids, but not as enthralling for adults."
1,Not noted......,"This is a children's book. I saw no mention of that fact. I love TP but this book I couldn't even begin to read. I tried to get my 9 year old son to read it, ""too boring"". It may be good for a young girl as the main character is a very young witch."
2,"Not funny, Magee","I never thought I would live to say this about Terry Pratchett, creator of an adopted dwarf who could be played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, but this book is simply not funny. Like Wentworth the toddler, it has only one joke: The pictsies are Scottish rebels and Rob Anybody is Rob Roy. Got it. The first time. Instead of humor, he is selling our birthright for a pot of message: stories and myths are bad, as though he does not use every myth and story he can get his hands on. So please let's have more about Captain Carrots and his collegues, and less about those big bad stories."
1,It's just so... so...,"I don't know the exact words to describe how I feel about this book. Thank goodness I got a library copy. I gave up on the book an hour ago, at page 97. For some reason, it just suddenly got... boring. The beginning was okay, while we were being introduced to Tiffany's life as a dairymaid. But it got too much of a bother to try to figure out the Wee Men; it wasn't just the accent they were given, it was just, I felt that they weren't convincing? Yeah, they weren't convincing for some reason.I also do not enjoy cheap laughs. Painful to see Pratchett milking the Aching name for all it was worth.Borrow, don't buy this."
1,Don't Bother Reading This Dull and Boring Book.,"In this story, a young want to be witch, Tiffany, is sent on a journey to find her stolen brother, Wentworth, who the Queen has stolen. On her journey, she meets tiny blue men named the Wee Free Men who are Scottish men addicted to drinking, cursing, and fighting. Along the way, they seem to protect Tiffany from ferocious dogs and other magical things. Finally at the end of the book, she meets the Queen, but there is a little problem. Find out if the Queen can negotiate with Tiffany to get her little brother back.What I liked about this book is that the author chose creative names for his characters. Also, I liked the way the Wee Free Men spoke among one another. What I didn't like is the entire story plot.If you enjoy Tinkerbell with Harry Potter and a touch of Braveheart, then you'll be able to relate this to another story. Other than that, I don't recommend this to anyone."
5,Ages 10-14? More like 10-110.,"I don't really see where the age suggestion of 10-14 came from. I thought the book was very much in line with Pratchett's other books and if I may suggest, I thought Wee Free Men was better than the newest Discworld book at this time, Monstorous Regiment.The main character of the book is a child in for a very Alice in Wonderland type of adventure, but the style and humor is pure Pratchett at his finest, with some cameo appearences from regular Discworld characters. I won't go into the detail that other reviews have already covered, I just wanted to emphasize that if you're somewhat well over the age of 14 and were wondering if this might still be enjoyable, wonder no more. If you liked Guards! Guards!, Carpe Jugulum and the other Discworld books, I'm sure you'll enjoy Wee Free Men."
5,You Have to read this!,"This is a terrific story for just about any age! Pratchett is famous for his books for the older generation, but his transition into children's books is flawless. It is perfect for kids without being insipid. A favorite!"
4,"Good book, lousy Amazon sticker","Great book. Good pictures. Lousy sticker.The book came with an Amazon barcode sticker on it, covering up the ISBN barcode. This would've been OK if it were a quality sticker, like Borders uses at retail; but it was a cheap sticker, which has left nasty crud behind. If I ever see one of these stickers on a book I buy from Amazon again, I will return it as defective, and go buy the book at retail."
3,They can't all be winners,"Terry Prachett is not a machine, and therefore I understand that he can't be expected to produce one hilarious book after another. Wee Free Men isn't bad. But it isn't great, either. I did laugh and I did enjoy it, but it seemed to me to be kind of a long way to go to introduce a new character. It did, however set the scene for a new book involving the withches-- a book to which I look forward with great anticipation. Wee Free Men is pretty good, but seems to lose track of itself from time to time. Again, not great, but good. You be the judge (but I'd wait to pick it up in paperback and save some $$$)."
4,:D,"Really enjoyed it, well worth reading. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy. Was a bit like a very long fairy tale with a twist."
5,Hilarious!!,This book is one of the most funny things I have read. Right up there with Jhon dies at the end
5,Wee Free Men,"This is the first in the Tiffany Aching stories, you can enjoy the rest with out reading this one but you will be missing alot. Miss Aching is 9 years old when she decides to become a witch, and with out knowing any magic she goes into the land of the elves, with only a frying pan, to save her little brother from the queen of the elves. Loved it. (the Feegle's help alot)"
5,Hillarious,"I wasn't disappointed at all, and was what I have come to expect from Terry Pratchett. His satire humorously mixes Scottish culture with that of fairie. I must admit it was a wee bit difficult reading the dialog from the pictsies, but it definitely made me stop and think and laugh harder. This is definitely a worthwhile buy IMHO."
4,I love the Tiffany Aching Stories,The Tiffany Aching stories by Terry Pratchett are fabulous! They are humorous and the characters are rich and there is not a better storyteller than Pratchett.
4,Harry Potter meets Terry Pratchett?,"OK, I liked this book. Pratchett can really write. I prefer his children's books to his books for adults. This is not my favourite however.Here we follow a nine year old girl that has just found out that she is a witch. The story is an old one. What I really like in the book is, of course, the wee free men - thrown out of Faerie land for being drunk and disorderly. Unlikely guardians for a little girl... Some of the minor characters are also very funny. Usually Prachett includes some clever description of curious phenomena in his books. Here we read about teachers following fairs, and giving lessons by the hour and receiving their salaries in groceries."
4,Reelcraft RT835OLP,"Seems good quality. Like it so far. Recoil tension seems a bit much, but hopefully it will lesson as it is used. Packing could have been better as the fittings poked thru the box during shipping and I only had one screw left out of the mounting hardware, so I had to buy my own"
5,The Wilde Bunch,"This book is probably one of Barbara Boswell's best works. She takes a story that hasn't been written to death, and makes it interesting while at the same time brings the chracters to life in a way that all readers enjoy. Mac and Kara are complete opposites in every way when she firsts comes to Mac's ranch, as a mail-order bride no less, to help take care of Mac's 4 orphaned neieces and nephews. The twist she has no idea who Mac Wilde is and thinks she is only in Montana to visit her pseudo Uncle. The story will twist and turn just enough so that you will be very suprised and delighted at the ending."
5,"In response to ""Credibility?""","This book and the other book about him being in florida are fictional, the books say that. The book by him that is true is Donnie Brasco : My Undercover Life in the Mafia: A True Story by FBI Agent . If you are looking for a true story read that one. For good entertain ment read this one..."
1,Credibility?,"It is difficult to believe that the author's writings in any way attest to actual FBI experience, or that his knowledge exhibits any kind of an in-depth appreciation of either Italian or Russian organized crime.His scenarios about either, in this book, are both weak and naive. It is just not believable, for example, that the hero, Donnie Brasco, has a daughter held hostage by the Italian Mafia in order to encourage him to find out about the doings of a Russian mafia group. The plot is extremely amateurish. The expressions used are exceptionally hackneyed and quite purile. This novel has no redeaming quality in that the author strives to create an honest or true reflection about any walk of life."
5,Excellent jigging choice,"Bought this rod for jigging off New England coast using jigs up to 16 oz. Rod performed very well, has enough power yet good sensitivity. Would definitely recommend it for this type of fishing as an excellent alternative to more expensive custom rods."
4,If you have the table saw buy it,"If you have the bosch small table saw and your looking at this, buy it. You need it and it works.JP"
3,Not quite right,"If you need an outfeed support for your Bosch table saw, this is it. There are not really any other alternatives.The design looks pretty good and the price is reasonable. The problem is in the manufacturing. Tolerances are WAY out of line.In order for this accessory to be usable, expect to drill & tap new 1/4-20 holes for the friction clamps, then order new 1/4-20 thumb screws to replace the ridiculously tiny (and VERY loose) screws that came with the unit.If you do this, the Outfeed support will function well.These issues are not what you expect for a tool with the Bosch name on it, not even close.Dan"
5,Great idea - works well,"This the extra set of hands you need when ripping large stock. Works perfectly, although, as with other reviewers, had to tweak the installation to get it to fit properly. But once installed, was a great addition to what was an already great table saw."
1,This product had missing pieces - Was likely returned by someone and resold to me,Received product fast but box was very beaten up and re-tapped. Was missing assembly instructions and a rod. Not worth retuning since the cost to ship back was 50% of the value.
5,Fits on 4100,"I think another reviewer says that this didn't fit on his 4100 model table saw, but I didn't have any issues putting it on mine. Well, I did have to install one of the brackets ""backwards"" in order to tighten the bolts that hold it to the table, but there were no alignment issues with the extension rods. I highly recommend it for working with larger pieces of plywood or MDF. KTHXBAI"
3,mike in maine,"After reading some of the poor reviews for this product I had some reservations.When I unpacked and assembled the extention I soon discovered the problems others had described.1st the miter guide slots don't align with the notches in the extention.2nd the sliding rails are too far apart, one owner had elongated the mounting holes to address this.The actual problem is in the illustrations in the instructions! The pictures of the model 4000 saw and the 4001 saw are reversed.Simply mount one bracket facing outward[the one with the lock knob]and the other facing inward,as pictured for the model 4001,and the extention fits and operates smoothly! Perhaps BOSCH should correct the instructions instead of agreeing they had made a manufacturing error to appease a dissatisfied customer. I hope this helps others who encounter this problem."
4,outfeed support,The outfeed support is a handy thing to have on a table saw. The only problem that I have encountered in useing it is that flexible materials like thin plywood tend to flex between the saw and the outfeed support and hit the support instead of going on top of it. This problem can be fixed by using a peice of scrap as a 'brige' to help the material make it onto the suport.
1,Backwards mounting necessary,"If you mount the extension according to the instructions, the miter bar isblocked from extending past the table edge as the slots in the extensionare in the wrong place; it is necessary to mount the extension backwardsso that the slots in the extension line up with the slots in the table; Icontacted Bosch about this error and they agreed that it has to be mountedbackwards to the table. Unfortunately this means that the piece sticksout from the side and if the extension is pushed completely back into thetable, the guide bar is blocked. I'm surprised that Bosch does not correctthis manufacturing/design error."
3,Rear Out Feed: Too Short,"I found the rear outfeed support to be about 12"" too short. A little longer would allow better balance when ripping 8' boards. Works well for what it is when used with an additional support beyond the table. Hides well when not in use."
1,Bosch TS1002 Rear Outfeed Support Extension,"It doesn't fit. I would give it zero stars, but that wasn't an option. If it fit properly, I would rate it a four or five."
3,Kinda handy,"It helps to have the support for longer pieces, but it sags a little bit.I have NO IDEA what the notches are for, except to get trimmings hung up in it and in your way. But hey, it's Chinese, so if it didn't cause us to take more time than necessary, well, they haven't accomplished anything while making commie products for ""the enemy""."
1,It's Not What it Appears to Be,I did not get to use this item. In the illustration it appears to be a sort-of table that would support a saw's outfeed. In fact it is a small bracket that attaches to a specific brand of saw. I was not able to use it with my saw.
2,Bosch Table Saw,This was my husband's 60th birthday present. He had researched all types of table saws and this came out as by far the best. He's in love with this thing.
5,Great series,"This is great, delivery was quick, we were very happy to receive it. Of course you need to watch the prior seasons for this to make sense. If you follow SG then of course you know that already. Enjoy"
3,atmospheric horror film,"On a wintery New Year's Eve two women (Jenny and Chrissy) and one man (Marty) embark on a short snowmobile excursion. When the snowmobile breaks down, they are forced to seek refuge in a deserted hotel. There they confront powerful evil forces. ""Ghostkeeper"" is a pretty creepy and atmospheric horror film which will keep you guessing until the end. The acting is solid and the atmosphere of fear and total isolation is well-captured. The location (snowy mountains and a mansion in the middle of nowhere) provide some chills. Check it out if you are a horror fan."
1,Not worth your money,"I am very disappointed with this toy. My son doesn't even look at it. It only sings Row Row Row your boat and the ABC's. It is very lame. I love Baby Einstein toys and videos, but this one needs a lot of help."
3,Ughh,"The puppet is ackward. It is very hard to get your fingers in the arms and move the mouth at the same time. The ""talking"" feature is not well done. As a stuffed animal, it would be cute, as a puppet I would not suggest purchasing it."
4,First lovey!,"My husband and I have a 5 month old and the three of us have had hours of enjoyment with this miraculous toy. No matter how bad his mood, the BLAH! at the end of the song makes him laugh. Daddy even used it as a puppet and gave it a voice and its own life. Only reason for four stars is that we only had it two months and it died... replaced batteries and got another three weeks before batteries wouldn't even revive it. Apparently this is the norm and probably why you find no mention of this product on the B.E. website. I hope and pray they are fixing this problem and reintroducing it. I can't figure a way to explain to a baby that his lovey can't sing anymore. BLAH!!!"
3,child not very interested,I bought this toy online and was under the impression that it was a plush non-puppet toy. Was disappionted to see the puppet because the toy is flip-floppy. Our 13 month old had santa bring it to him last christmas at 3 months old and still doesn't like the toy. It only has the two songs so it gets boring. We LOVE baby einstein in our house but their toys are a bit pricey for the quality.
2,How to Excel at Distribution sales in the New Milenium,"I did not purchase this book, rather a copy was leant to me for review before I was to make a decision to purchase. First of all, why would anyone pay close to a $100 for a semi good sales book when so much more information and the same sales tactics that Dave Kahle uses have been used for years in all types of industries. I believe Dave is simple trying to make all his money on minimum book sales and not trying to inform the public of how great he thinks he may be."
5,I have been a forever fan of this series,What can be any better than Absolutely Fabulous? Absolutely nothing. I have adored this series since the first time I saw it. If you are new to Ab Fab you will be in for such a treat.
4,A wing wetter,The perch works just fine. It holds our Blue Crown securely and we have had no problems
4,Good Overall,"My cockatiel LOVES the shower, and when I moved, there was no longer a towel rack inside my shower. This was a great alternative (and a very thoughtful gift from my boyfriend). My one complaint is the rust. It was a little rusty before I even used it, and I'm just not that fond of the idea of rust around a bird.I think that the grip on the bar is fine for the bird... he's only fallen off when he got soooo into his shower that he leaned too far forward and lost his balance.I have found that my birds prefer showers over to spray bottles, etc, and do recommend the shower perch... just wish that something made for the shower didn't actually rust."
2,Unsafe Out of the Box,"This product isn't safe or ready to use out of the box. The materials used aren't adequate for the purpose intended. Specifically the suction cups do not stick and cannot hold the weight of the perch. Even after replacing the suction cups multiple times, the perch couldn't keep it's grip on a glass mirror for more than 5 minutes. (*If you decide to ignore my review to find out for yourself, please test the product prior to shower time.*)I don't know about you, but I'm not willing to risk the life of my feathered friend to save some floor space. The design is smart, but there definitely has to be another solution.Now I like to use a DVD Tower or Clothes Drying Rack to provide more stability.REMINDER: Do not put your birds back in their cages wet! It would be like You sitting in soggy clothes all day. My parrotlet loves the blow-dryer!"
3,Gotta be a better way to mount this...,This perch sticks pretty good on both the window and shower tiles but with the suction cups being within beak range of the perch I constantly have to keep an eye on my parrot with this so he doesn't pull one loose (He has done that several times now). The perch works as advertised but seems like if the suction cups were under the perch it might be easier to keep the beaks of it.
3,could use some tweeking...,"This is a fantastic idea, however, it will not stay attached to the shower wall. I've tried many tricks to get it to stay to no avail. I notice on the product photo there are 3 suction cups, mine has only two. Maybe that's the problem"
1,dangerous!,"this is really unsafe for pet birds as the suction cups don't even hold up the perch by itself for more than 1 minute on neither clean tile nor glass. such a waste of money, really disappointed in this product."
2,Needs more and better quality suction cups,I have never complained about anything that I have bought on Ebay or Amazon. This will be a first. I will say the item does not match picture. There were only 2 suction cups. Not three like the picture. The perch itself is to heavy to be supported with only two poor quality suction cups. They sell better suction cups than that at Walmart. I am going to keep the perch and make some modifications to it and make it work.
1,pour warranty,"I had this product for less than four months and it broke. The glass part separated from the stainless steel. I called peugeot and they said ""There life time warranty is only for the grinder part not the whole pepper mill. What a joke... Needless to say they would not replace it."
4,Best Pepper Mill Ever,"The only thing keeping this from getting 5 stars is the price. I guess you get what you pay for.I've been using an electric pepper mill for a year now that looked very similar to this one. I've had a number of issues with that one and it finally just broke down completely. I looked up a replacement here on Amazon and found this one. Then realized that the one I've been using is one of many cheap knockoffs. This Peugeot unit is the original. As I said above, you certainly pay for it. Is it worth it, I'm not sure. But it's an incredibly smooth, solid operation. I'm sure I'll be using this for many years to come."
1,WARNING Products possibly factory seconds or even second hand,DO NOT BUY AS GIFTS...I puchased 5 of these to start with. When they arrived the product pagageing was damaged and the actual grinder didn't look new in the box so I got Amazon to replace them when the replacements arrived they looked even worse to the point of even being scratched. Amazon say they are new....I say not likely!
4,Looks and grinds great,"It feels really solid and it is easy to control the size of the pepper. I never knew I needed a light on my pepper mill, but now I wouldn't want one without it. We've been peppering things in the dark all these years--who knows what we've been doing?I also like the little metal cap that comes with the grinder that keeps any bits of pepper from coming out of the end when it is sitting on the counter top. My only complaint is that I feel the on/off button could have been better designed as it takes a little too much force to press it--but that is minor.This is a nice addition to my kitchen."
5,"Excellent Product, Excellent Service","This item is the BEST.It arrived with a broken light and Amazon rocked in getting the new one sent speedily, which works perfectly.Love the product, LOVE AMAZON."
1,MONKEY'S TREE,"SHE HAD VERY LITTLE INTEREST IN THIS TOY. TOO MANY PIECES, TOO HARD FOR LITTLE FINGER TO PUT TOGETHER. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY"
4,A Good Book That Leaves You Wanting More,"This was the first book I ever read about reincarnation, and it was a great place to start. Because the stories are each written by the people themselves, they offer a variety of styles and perspectives that provide a great overview of the issues of reincarnation, karma, and healing.This book is passionately written. The stories, and commentary by Yonassan Gershom, are honest and not fanatical. There is a pointedly open-minded attitude in the presentation, which does not assume that the reader believes in reincarntion. However, by the end of it I found myself believing and wanting to learn more.For a more scientific approach to the topic, try reading Old Souls, by Tom Shroder. For more detailed descriptions of reincarntion and the spirit world, as recovered through hypnosis, check out Journey of Souls, by Michael Newton."
3,Good book,"This book contains 15 stories of people claiming to be reincarnated after living during the holocaust. If we get these stories as true, it is easy to say that almost all of them are ( maybe also unwillingly ) blended with fantasy and imagery. (it is nasty to say, but maybe Gershom should be explained something about the law of cause and effect). Though both the stories and his opinions are a bit arguable, this book is a good one. It may be read from cover to cover in a couple of hours. I consider it as a ""light"" book. Maybe it is not a good thing to take it too seriously."
4,Thought provoking,"At times this book was a harder reader. The reader had to suspend his or her disbelief to hang with the story and get to a greater meaning at the end. I was shocked by the twisted at the end. However, when looking at the series from a completed perspective, the picture is truly beautiful. Ms. Hardy portrays a message that reason ages with the heart and continues to proclaim the truth."
5,Love it I'm sure!,"I haven't had a chance to re-read this one yet, but I've owned them in paperback before (lost in a house fire). I loved it before so I'm sure I'll love it again!"
4,Great workout ... but...,THe work out was ok if you are beginner... Poor cueing ... I would recomended if you don't use it as your only workout.
3,"Not great, not horrible","She is fun and the moves aren't that difficult but also not super easy either. The camera angles are pretty good; unlike some videos where you are just looking at their face when you need to see their foot work, or it's so schizophrenic that you get dizzy. The music is good, but like most videos' for me, I get bored with them after a couple of weeks. I would buy another from her, like her energy."
5,Howard Miller Chiming Wall Clock,"I have had this clock for awhile now and it keeps time beautifully. The clock itself is very well made; a beautiful light oak, and is nicer than the picture. We love the chimes, and the fact that you can reduce the volume if you want a quieter chime. The chime is reduced significantly at night, but not off entirely. For some that might be a problem, but you can turn off the chimes if you want. I believe this is a very good value."
3,Had higher expectations for these,I bought these as a replacement for my originals which had become seized. I noticed that one caliper had reused pistons that appeared to be sanblasted to remove rust as they were pitted but without rust. . Not sure how this affects integrity or reliability. Within a month the calipers have rusted on the outside as the metallic paint they came with wore off. Even the new zinc coated bolts rusted. Also one caliper drags slightly. Overall not so impressed from a brand like Raybestos. Had higher expectations for these.
5,Toughest Book I Ever Loved,"It took me several years before I was ready to work this book. I would pick it up, get paralyzed with fear, and then put it down. Once I was ready, it changed my life completely. I buy a new one every year or so, and work it for different reasons. Totally changed my world. I am forever grateful to the author."
3,I'm just not the journaling type. Are you?,"Ok, ok, I have to admit I have journaled this year and so I bought the book hoping it would help me streamline the work I need to do. However, it didn't. But not because it's not well thought out but because I prefered to follow my own thoughts and feelings in my own way rather than the way layed out in the book. If you're interested in purchasing this book I recommend looking at it in person and carefully thinking about whether it will be helpful to you. It's basically lots of empty space (so you can journal) but it does give you suggestions and examples on what to journal about. I'd say that the more you struggle facing your issues the more helpful the book will be to you because it will give you ideas."
3,corresponding book,I just wanted potential customers to know...that the workbook is structured to correspond with the book. IF you purchase the workbook ALONE... the writer's instruct you to read passages in their book prior to continuing with a various workbook section. I cannot yet rate the merits of the material...as I have yet to recieve the book in the mail...so that I can begin.
4,"Nice pillow, but not 100% down","Nice pillow (I'll let the other reviews speak to that), but it's not 100% down as the item description would lead you to believe. The tag attached to the pillow (the one inside the outer cover that only the consumer is allowed to remove) says ""(minimum 75% down)."" The fact that it's not 100% down may be the reason it's as firm as it is. If you're looking for a firm, ""mostly down"" pillow, you should give this a try."
2,Disappointing....too soft,"I am a side sleeper and have a problem with my old down pillows being too soft...I wake up with my head practically on the mattress and down filled areas of my pillow on each side rather than under my head. Well, I thought a $300 pillow would fix that. It didn't. I tried it last night and still woke up with a flattened pillow.I was really hoping...I guess I may have to go to a non-down pillow."
2,Not worth the price,"My husband is very picky about his pillow and after multiple purchases trying to find a suitable one for him I decided that I would try the more expensive one.After searching the internet and reading numerous reviews I decided to purchase this one. Being in the "" frame of mind"" that you get what you pay for, I decided to give this one a try. I should have stayed with my local Walmart. This pillow was a big disappointment."
2,Half empty pillow (or half full ),"Very inconsistent quality . I ordered 2 pillows , one had about half down as other . Returned both."
3,"Soft, but does not give any neck support","This pillow is soft, and comfortable but squishes and flattens down almost instantly. I wanted a high quality pillow that gave some support, but wasn't overly puffy. Unfortunately, this is not it."
3,"Fits, great idea, but doesn't work well on BMW","This harness seems like a brilliant idea, and it does fit the car, however the problem is that the factory amp requires a signal far stronger than RCA outputs. I had to keep my stereo's volume nearly maxed out all the time to hear at a level sufficient enough for low-speed driving. My HU has 6-volt preouts too. I ended up using a different adapter made by PAC which allows me to use the HU's internal amp and attentuate it accordingly for the factory amp."
2,Read below...,"I purchased this adapter according to product selection tool from Metra website (metraonline.com) for 2001 BMW 530i. It turned out to be the wrong part. After a trip to the local stereo shop, I found correct plug adapter for my car, Metra 70-9003, which metraonline.com lists as 2002-up 5-series. Even at that point, 70-9003 had to be modified to send proper 4V pre-amp signal to stock BMW amp. I had to cut RCA adapters from 70-8591 and connect them into 70-9003 speaker wire inputs.In short, you will need to buy both 70-8591 and 70-9003 adapter harnesses to make it work right on 01-03 US-spec 5-series. This install was done on a non-DSP equipped car."
3,not for amp integration!!!!,"It's wrong.... it's not for amp integration, it's to install any head unit in replacement of the original BMW radio.... all connectors are inverted (male instead of female) not work as described!I think it works fine for the real purpose"
3,Item has been returned,"I bought this item because Amazon suggested that people who bought a Bushnell boresighter also bought this. This does not work with the boresighter, as stated. I have returned arbor, and the boresighter works fine."
2,See the First One(Azumi),"While well made and acted, this had the feel of being too episodic and predicatble. As the story progressed nothing that happened surprised me or even particularly interested me. See the first one -- Azumi -- which is worth the effort and closes with a bang well worth staying around for..."
4,Fun yoga!,"I've done the first part 4 or 5 times now. At first I was a bit put off by the ""yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm""ing and tongue-sticking-outing, but that does seem to be a good way to release tension. This gets 4 rather than 5 stars because the breathing can be rushed in places, but there's no reason why you can't do them more slowly. I think I wind up doing 3 lungs for every 4 she does. You do have to watch the directions the first time through (later, you should be able to do them without watching, when your face is away from the screen). But to balance that out, there is a brief medition/quiet time at the end of the routines. I can definitely tell I'm working while doing this, but even in my currently grossly overweight and out of shape state I finished (with a few breathers). But best of all, I really do feel more relaxed and calm after finishing.I haven't done the second part yet because I've enjoyed the first so much, but I'll give it a try this weekend."
2,If your less than a beginner...,"I usually love everything Hemalayaa does and was excited to see she was doing a yoga video even if it was for the beginner. I've been doing Yoga for six months and thought I could use this video but it was just totally lacking. It's VERY light stretching but Hemalayaa puts her personal touch on it and includes some of the most basic yoga poses. I was disappointed and glad I rented it first, even if your a beginner pass on this one."
3,This isn't beginner voga,This was more advanced than we expected. If you are well acquainted with yoga this is probably okay. The sessions begin and take off with little instruction. Perhaps when we are better it will be more suitable for us.
5,Lean Design Solution Delivers What it Promises,"The ""Lean Design Solution"" is an easy to read book which guides you through the world of lean design. The text is richly layered with practical examples and real life situations. The author goes to great lengths to engage the reader and keep the subject matter interesting. This book is a must have resource for people working in design or manufacturing."
4,Very instructional,"The Lean Design Solution not only gives great insight into the the theory of lean design, but also gives direct and simple instruction on the ""how to"" practice lean design. The solutions and tools mentioned in the book combine well with existing lean design and lean manufacturing strategies. I found that the book was very easy to read and contained a lot of real life examples."
3,Don't Be Fooled,"This CD looks great on the surface, with three versions of I'd Do Anything For Love (plus one of Rock and Roll Dreams Come True). The 3 versions are: Live, Unplugged, and Edit. It is a fantastic song, and the performances are top notch. But it only gets 3 stars because, while the original version is 12' long and has 6 verses with the female lead, these versions have only 3, 3, 4 verses, respectively, and are 4-6' each. I like the original too much and cannot tolerate an abridged version."
5,One of Steinman's best songs.,"Originally released as a the A side of a single included with Jim Steinman's ""Bad for Good"" solo album, this song was then covered by Meat Loaf for ""Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell."" This is the superior version by far. Loaf's exceptional vocals really help to bring out the brilliance of the writing. More than Steinman was able, Loaf digs down to the emotion of the song."
3,Pterygium,"So far I dont see any improvement, it is supposed to work in 4 wks, this is my third one and nothing different yet."
2,Overheating battery,"This is my first laptop. Overall it works pretty well with 3 major exceptions. 1. If I don't keep the right underside of it open to constant ventilation, it overheats within 30 minutes and shuts down. Averatec {Hitachi} claims this model was not included in their overheating battery recall earlier this yr. I beg to differ. My son, who builds and programs computers says this laptop definitely should not be getting this hot, EVER!2. The DVD/CD Rom, Drive/Player stopped working after 5 months and I had only used it 4 or 5 times. It simply does not recognize that there is a DVD/CD in the drive.3. Averatec's customer service stinks. They do NOT stand behind their products when things go wrong."
1,Decent laptop with a ton of flaws,"This laptop looks great but its performance is very poor in several areas. First, the battery overheats to the extent that after an hour or so, the area around the touchpad is literally too hot to touch for any period of time. Second, the wireless capacity is absolute garbage. Even sitting next to my router, I loose my wireless signal every couple of minutes. Meanwhile, my brother's Dell keeps a signal into the next zip code. Don't get me wrong, I dislike Dells, which is the reason I bought an Averatec in the first place. But my purchase was misguided. If you're going to spend $1000+ on a laptop, get an HP, or suck it up and get a cheap IBM."
4,Great notebook,"At first I was a little skeptical, since I have never even heard of Averatec, but after 4 months of owning it, I have to say it's the best notebook I ever had, including HP. It is fast and reliable. The battery lasts 2 and a half hours. The screen size is great. My kids love the DVD player. I take it to gymnastics meets and the kids watch up to 3 movies, like advetised, and they don't care if the picture is a little stretched. It works great with my router, never had any problems whatsoever. I reccommend it to anyone."
2,Good NoteBook; Bad Portable DVD Player,I bought it because it said it's the biggest screen Dvd player in the world/ notebook computer. AS a notebook it's works great and has good screen size except DVD burner[it comes with one even though not advertise ] needs firmware upgrade [ not found].As a DVD player it's a joke. it plays DVDs but widescreen shows one inch taller as it suppose to be and no way to watch full screen movie since it straches it as widescrren regardless of settings. once movie start playing noway to get back to manu screen. [ No help there either.]
2,Frustration Is Unrewarded,"Whew! This is like reading four books in one as Tabio jumps between multiple storylines, spending only 2-5 pages on each before switching. One is set in present-day Mexico City and is centered on a downtrodden crime writer who gets obsessed with watching women's college basketball. Another follows a CIA operative circa 1975 as he flees Vietnam and tracks him until the present. A third is about the unionist and anarchist upheavals in Spain in the 1920s. Yet another is about Leonardo DaVinci. Most reviews I read said that it is a frustrating read at the beginning, but the end is worth it. I dispute that, as all these stories converge into what I found to be a very unsatisfying ending."
3,"Good game, but boring","The game is very good overall, but has 1 major drawback: you can't adjust the speed, and it is insanely slow. This isn't so bad late in the game when you have lots of $ and things going on, but when you first get started it is boring as hell. I don't know if you've ever played 1503 A.D. The New World, but it has the same problem."
3,Knights of Honor,A slow but fun game for someone who does not like non-stop action. Helps you learn European history.
3,Not Bad,This game is pretty fun when u started playing but later on u got bore... i waste my money....
3,good game,ok i enjoyed the game play.i got this game at realese cause i liked the concept.my comlaint is i could not find a online site to play others.i went to a few popular ones and offical site.and i wanted the option of adding units of my choice to the quick battle board so after i beat it i got really bored and even quick play battles were limited at this point.
2,Definately not what I expected,"I saw such good reviews that I decided to buy this, but what a dismay! I expected a book that could bring some tips on finance problems, how to deal with some awkward situations that singles have to deal with and so on. All with some humour and witts. Instead I found a book that is all about accepting God's will for you (sorry, im not a believer) and has religion everywhere in the text and that ultimately urges you to embrace the Mr Right of all, Jesus.There are probably about 3-4 ideas that can be helpful and probably a very religious person would find it a consolation (indeed that is the feeling you have in the end of the book), that's why I didn't give one star. But please! You have sexual urges so you solve this problem by waiting for mr Right and by going out with your girlfriends! In which century are we? It is not really savvy, is it?"
5,Good book for single women,"Finally a book for single women, by a single woman! The author knows how we feel and tells it like it is. She gives insight into our interactions with family, friends, and church members as singles and how to see where they're coming from, which helps ease some tension. A really good book if you're even remotely dissatisfied or having a hard time being single."
5,A MUST READ!!!!,"Single Christian women need a voice and Camerin Courtney is a great one. Think ""Sex in the City"" with a wholesome, Christian appeal. With a lighthearted, understanding humor she disarms a good deal of the silliness that gets a single girl down: being picked on by relatives for not being married, having to spend holidays or vacations more or less alone, etc. She has many good ways to overcome the ""single girl blues"" that we unattached ladies can fall prey to."
1,Ripped off,Canceled order but still sent and billed for it. Not not that great of a dvd. Not worth the spent for it.
2,If you're really interested in improving your sex life...,"If you're really interested in improving your sex life through yoga......I would avoid this video. I'm sorry, I'm sure the instructor who made this series is a terrific person, but this completely misses as a yoga video. This video is really soft-porn. If you want soft-porn, then buy this video or any other soft-porn that suits your fancy, but if you're interested in how yoga and the ancient Hindu teachings can help you improve your sex life, there are far better sources available. Tantric, Kundalini, and Kama Sutra teachings all offer far superior information about sexuality. Truthfully, any vigorous yoga practice will help you develop the necessary physical core power for a spectacular sex life. And, if you really want to take it to a different level, then explore tantric teachings and you will discover the beauty of your own sexuality."
2,better sex through yoga 1,"I brought this video because of the good reviews it received. I would not reccommand this video to anyone. The picture quality isn'tvery good. It looks like a homemade video. The music is very annoying. Along with the music you hear (breath through you sexual core, Etc..) The sound is not good. It sounds kind of hollow. Like there's a slight echo. I really don't have anything good to say about this dvd. I can't tell you about Volume II or III because I was very disappointed in I. The only reason I gave this dvd 2 stars is because the moves are so bad."
4,Madame Alexander Store Exclusives & Limited Editions,This is an excellent reference book for the Madame Alexander doll collector. Being a Madame Alexander Doll Club member I found particularly helpful the section on Madame Alexander Club dolls from the early years of the club. It was the first time I had seen some of these. Also enjoyed seeing the store specials and one of a kind dolls. Recommend this book to any Madame Alexander collector.
3,Mine would randomly reset itself!,"I was somewhat disappointed with this. I wore it for two entire days, and both days it somehow reset itself at some point. I found myself looking at it constantly to kind of ""check on it"". On the second day I even wrote down the number every so often, and sure enough it reset, but at least I had a clue where I was at that point. So I was fairly disappointed in that respect. Now this is the first pedometer I have ever used, so I can't compare to others.. like if this is a common occurrence at all?"
4,a fine debut,"This accessible and enjoyable novel is a fine debut by Mr. Parsons. I think I enjoyed the central character the most. He is well drawn, intelligent, and human--not at all one dimensional. Mr. Parsons writes vividly, plots ably, and has delivered a great first novel. I look forward to his second."
5,new orleans style cajun,"This is the best sound on the french quarter. You will hear this music playing from the stores, but they are sold out of this cd because it sells and sounds so good. Its real cajun flavor music with a rock and soul feel. This is the only album that you want to talk home from South Louisianna."
3,Not Willie For Me,"Before everyone begins to stone me to death, my reasons for giving this album a thumbs down is simple. There are 3 boleros, and a merengue. However, ""Oh Que Sera"" is one of my favorite Colon songs ever and ""Mi Sueño"" is just hair raising for me. ""Toma mis Manos"" round out the only good songs 3 of 8 and display his ability to create great music not only sound wise, but with meaningful, poetic and touching lyrical content. I actually give this album a 2.5 rating because more than half of the tracks are completely forgettable and I really don't see how this to a 5 star album like ""Siembra."" You simply cannot rank this one up there with it."
5,BEST DANCE TRACK EVER,"BY FAR, MY FAVORITE DANCE TRACK OF ALL TIME. WHEN I BECOME A DJ I WILL PLAY THIS TRACK DURING MY SETS. HOPEFULLY, IT WILL STILL BE HUGE IN ANOTHER 10 YEARS. I SAW THE VINYL OF THIS TRACK AT A HOT TOPIC BACK IN 2000 AND DIDN'T BUY IT AND I AM SORRY I DIDN'T. FINALLY, 12 YEARS AFTER IT CAME OUT I HAVE GOTTEN IT ON VINYL."
5,Wiring Harness for Ford Focus - Blaupunkt Head Unit,"After searching forums high and low for adapters to connect the existing wiring in my car to something that would connect to the optional headunit that came with the 2000-2005 Ford Focus, I was relieved to find some so easy to get connections sorted and have nice music piping through to my speakers.The wires are coded to be color coordinated with the existing wiring, and if you're purchasing this for your FoFo, don't switch the wires as some instructive forums suggest. Metra seems to have updated the color coordination so that the wires exactly match your existing wiring.I would definitely recommend this for anyone who needs it - it's a no brainer."
1,NEVER USE THESE BANDS,"I was exercising with a band such as this when it SNAPPED out of nowhere and hit my left eye! I can't see barely anything and I am now facing eye surgery at 17. Please do not put yourself at the risk, your vision is not worth it."
2,sure,my (now ex) girlfriend ordered this. i don't really know why. she got it shortly before she left me for a woman. perhaps the two things are related...
4,"Good Product,, a Little Light For Me","I bought the medium resistance tube because I didn't know what to expect. The medium is a little light in my opinion. I figured out how to add more rsistance to the band making it worthwhile for my strength training. I would say if you're looking for more of a challenge then get the heavy tube. This product is in no way bad and if this is you're first band, get it. You can stil find creative ways to use it."
4,Ow my eye,"If you use the door attachment, make sure the door you use it on doesnt have a gap wide enough that the attachment will pop through after a few minutes of using it. User error on my part I guess, but, ow my eye. Hope that doesn't happen to anyone else. It's great for the money otherwise (assuming you don't use the door attachment, or use it with a good proper door)."
4,Great Product!,Great upper body work-out.As I do not always have time to go to the gym.Very well made.
2,Started to break,I guess that you can't really use this on sidewalks because my started to rip and now it has a hole in it.
3,you will need a few...,"I suppose that ""very heavy"" is all a matter of perspective. I have two blue bands, two of the purple, and then one each of the red, green, and yellow bands. I consistently use two purple + one blue to do any sort of back exercise. The resistance is sufficient.. and that's about all I can say about it. If you are at all serious about your exercise, then you will have to double or triple up on these bands to get a workout. But overall, I haven't had any issues with the quality of SPRI bands, yet!"
3,buy a few at a time.,"I suppose that ""heavy"" is all a matter of perspective. I have two blue bands, two of the purple ""very heavy"", and then one each of the red, green, and yellow bands. I consistently use two purple + one blue to do any sort of back exercise. The resistance is sufficient.. and that's about all I can say about it. If you are at all serious about your exercise, then you will have to double or triple up on these bands to get a workout. But overall, I haven't had any issues with the quality of SPRI bands, yet!"
3,This Is Not A Heavy Band,"This is a good medium band at best, but not even close to being a heavy band. I'm a man, and I use it for several tricep kick back reps. For the average woman, this is a heavy band. My wife uses it for most of her 10 minute trainer exercises, but I only use it for a couple. I found a much heavier black band on amazon, that I highly recommend. To give you an idea about this band; with the biggest loop doing bicep curls, this band equates to MAYBE 20 lbs dumbells. With that other much heavier black band I found; with the same size loop I can barely do 8 reps. I'm guessing its more like 35 lbs and that is a huge difference."
3,Not what you want to get if you're a heavy lifter,"I bought this product around a month ago. I thought it wouldn't be a bad idea since I'm unable to go to the gym more than 4 times a week, and that I would probably use this for some heavy resistance, but the very heavy turned out to be much lighter than I thought, and I doubt the Ultra heavy is much of an increase. To be honest I don't really benchpress that much compared to others, around 90 pound dumbells, and I could easily do around 18 reps on the Xertube. Don't get me wrong it's not a bad product except their resistance isn't so resistant. Women and a casual lifters might enjoy this product, and this product can give a great deal of toning, but if you're a heavy lifter, don't count on it for anything other than some light toning. It just doesn't have enough resistance."
4,Great replacement band for Wii Active,"I hope this review helps out others looking to replace their Wii Active band, which is cheaply made and bound to rip (like mine did). I had a difficult time finding a replacement. This band is the way to go. The handles are a little thicker than the Wii Active band, so it's a little more difficult to hold the band and the Wii equipment, but it hasn't been a problem for me. The band has more resistance than the Wii Active band (which I thought didn't provide enough resistance, anyway), but it is possible to complete all of the exercises, unlike some other bands I tried. I haven't used it enough to judge durability, but it appears to be of high quality.NOTE: For some reason, Amazon lumps together reviews for multiple SPRI resistance bands, which made my research even more difficult. This review refers to the very light (yellow) SPRI band. Do not buy the deluxe version to use with Wii Active--the handles are too big to hold with the Wii remote and numchuk."
2,not what I thought,Was not at all what I thought it was going to be. It does not fill my need for equipment. The discription should have been better in describing the equipment so I could have made a better choice. Unfortunatly I am not happy with it.
2,Not Medium Resistance,"The tube was definitely not medium resistance. It was more like extra light, beginner level. I got this to use in conjunction with P90X and was definitely bummed about it..as well as P90X which I thought was absurd."
3,product review,It arrived on time but it wasn't what I expected. The seller did great on their part though. Kudos!
2,Not for men who want to gain weight,"I've been using a red SPRI Xertube band with P90X for about a week. I do NOT recommend this resistance band.Here are some problems with it:* it claims to offer resistance for the ""fit"" to ""very fit"" range. I can do 20lb bicep curls, 10 rep max. This band lets me do curls forever. If I make a loop, things improve but:* if you use loops or shorter sections of the band, it's hard to keep track of how much you ""lifted"". With dumbbells, it's clear and you can track your progress.* the handles are not cushioned or rubberized. They're simple plastic and tend to rub against my palm.* the handles are not extensible with additional tubes. Compare that to Lifelineusa bands, where you can put up to three bands on the handle and greatly vary the resistance.* as another reviewer mentioned, bands don't really work for muscle gain. They work for strength and toning.Pros:* much cheaper than dumbbels, and easy to carry around."
2,Weak Band,"I was not very happy with the amount of resistance this band provided. Also, after less than 3 weeks of using this band (2-3 times/week), it snapped on me."
3,Good Overall Workout,They are very light weight - but the blue ones were too hard for me.Keep the reps going and you'll get a good workout.
3,Good for Home Workouts,These are pretty good overall arm workout.Not sure how much muscle is being built - but they do the trick at home.
3,Serves it's purpose.,"I usually bring these with me when I travel, just in case my hotel doesn't have a workout room. With these, you are only limited by your imagination as to the exercises you can perform. The only reasons I chose to give it a three-star rating are that the resistance leaves a bit to be desired, it gives off a stronger latex smell than I would like and it was made in Mexico."
3,Great product - unless it falls apart like mine did,"I have purchased three of the blue (heavy) Xertubes over the years. The first one lasted about 1 year of moderate 3x a week use until the bands started t crack and broke. Not too bad. The second one is only a few months old and works well with only slight signs of wear. The third one arrived today and broke the first time I used it. The band slipped out of the handle grommet (due to a defect in the anchor ""bulge""). The snap of the band raised a large welt on my leg and arm. These are excellent for travel workouts -- but watch out!"
1,There are better products!,"There appears to be safety issues raised by other contributors. I would recommend spending more money and purchasing a Lifelineusa product. You can get a resistance level of from 30 to 300 lbs, depending upon the number of cables (up to 3) and the thickness of the cable. The doorjamb attachment is wellmade. I find a resistance level of about 120-150 lbs. is my limit. A resistance of 70 lbs. is good, at least for me, for a baseball throwing motion. Would anyone have a recommend for a power twister. It is also known generically as a chest toner. Hope my comment helps. Thanks for any assistance on my issue."
3,good for in home gym,Good for in home gym but probably should have gone with the lighter one. This is truly heavy but true to its description. Very good product. Great quality.
4,Does its job,"It's not really to difficult to review an item like this resistance band. Basically what needs to be said is that it does what it advertises. It offers very heavy resistance. Its a strong band, with good hands, and good length. The only negative is that when you recieve it, once it comes out of the box it is covered in this strange white powder. I presume that it is meant to keep the rubber from sticking to itself however it rubs off on your clothes and is a bit of a pain to get off, as it comes off slowly over 3 to 5 uses, meaning multiple laundry trips for no other purpose. Regardless, its a good band that offers a good amount of resistance for a good price."
1,Heavy resistance band,The first time I used the heavy resistance band and went to lift it over my head the handle came loose from the rubber. I don't think I will be able to get the ball end back into the rubber tubing. Consequently I don't stretch my other bands over my head. I am under six feet tall and thought I could do a press with it. The bands need to be longer for anyone over five feet tall.
2,Breaks Too Easily,"I have owned three of these in a period of just over a year, and all three have broken on me. I was definitely not misusing the product, as everything I was doing with it was in the instructions that came with them.They do give a decent upper body workout while they last, and I don't expect them to last forever, but after having my last one break within two months of purchase, I will not buy any more of these."
3,Not exactly what I'd expected,"The bands are high quality, but they don't provide quite as much resistance as I'd expected. I used them twice and then switched to a much sturdier band. These say they are for fit women, but they do not provide the resistance this ""semi-fit"" woman requires. The over-the-door attachment has a very small stopper. The second time I used the band, the attachment flew out of a closet door and the band hit me in the chest. It was a very painful reminder to make sure that it is secure every time. Be careful using the attachment on any door that does not have a very tight fit. Otherwise, I am very pleased!"
4,It's okay but needs to be longer.,"I bought the blue/heavy resistance band to use in two of my tube workouts. The band I had no longer provided enough resistance and it was time to upgrade.Two things to point out. The handles are not padded. Not a big deal.Secondly, this tube is about 6 inches shorter than what I was previously using. The measurements are in the description. I thought the bands were a standard length so I didn't pay attention to the length. In order to use this band in my workouts, I need to reposition my body/grip/whatever during some of the exercises due to the shorter length.The band is still a nice upgrade from what previously used. Just look at measurements if the band is going to be used as a replacement band."
1,dangerous,"using the heavy band for the third time, hard part of the door anchor, the thing that supposedly keeps it anchored in the door squeezed right through the door and into my chest. luckily, it didn't come into my eye. i was using it exactly as the box instructs and the door is in great shape with no problems. it is designed very poorly and is extremely dangerous, please be aware that it can easily slide through your door."
2,Weak,"For a heavy band this is too weak for P90X. I use the ultra heavy and its ok. My friend bought medium and heavy at a local Modelle's and they were much thicker and more rugged. They arent terrible, but there are better out there. Would not recommend these."
3,fine after I made modifications,"The tubing is perfect resistance for me and that part works well. The handles were very floppy and flexible, which doesn't work when you are trying to lift the tubing during exercise. So, I took a package of popsicle sticks, and inserted as many as would fit inside each handle tube to make them stiff and inflexible. That worked out fine and now I can use them without any problem."
3,"Functions Perfect, Needs padded Grips","Works great, good resistance. Grips are plain hard plastic and are somewhat uncomfortable. It would be better if it had padded handles."
4,more resistance than I expected,"I was a little apprehensive buying this one because it was so cheap but it's really sturdy and provides a good deal of resistance. When I need more I just combine it with the red Xertube or the blue one. My only caveat is that the door attachment doesn't work as well as i'd like. It stays in the door, but doesn't necessarily keep the band taught enough for effective overhead exercises."
4,Excellent,Perfect for someone who lives in an apartment and needs to use something for weight training and in conjunction with the P90x routine.
4,Decent Band,"This band is a good quality band. I have only used it for a couple weeks and it has held up nice. I prefer these plastic handles over the fatter cushioned ones. The door attachment it comes with is nice but I am not 100 percent at ease while using it because the ball stopper on the strap that's supposed to keep it from snapping back at you should be bigger. Maybe its ok, but if you use it with a door that does not close solid then it might find its way in your face or back. Bottom line is just be smart about it. Overall I am satisfied with this purchase and will purchase another resistance soon."
4,A Very Good Product,The SPRI Resistance Band is a very good product. I have used it almost everyday since I got it and I have started to notice the results. I just follow along with the exercise chart and have created a routine that I use throughout the week. I have only needed to use the gym for my cardio workout and the resistance band fills in the gaps between my strength training workouts. The heavy band gives me just the right amount of resistance to give me a good session so I continue to use it on almost a daily basis. I would recommend that those that are starting to get into more exercise use the medium band before moving on to the heavier bands as they do create a good amount of resistance. But I would recommend this as a good product to supplement your workouts with.
5,This is perfect!,"It came really quick. It doesn't deliver right to your door with a mailman. They put it in your mailbox (that's where I found mine). This is a great excersising tool to stay or on-the-go. It's VERY durable and the blue resistance honestly, isn't that strong (around a 10lb resistance if lifted singlely). So I recommend purple ones."
5,Inexpensive and does the trick!,"I have been using these (green and red) for over a week now. They're easy to use and store. I loved using the door attachment too. I did read some reviews about the dangers of the door attachment. But as long as you follow the directions well and make sure the door is CLOSED, and pull hard on the attachment to make sure it doesn't move - you should be absolutely fine.The price too is perfect! I just hope the bands and the handle attachments last for a long time."
3,too short to be a medium,This band is very short and therefore much harder to work with than the medium bands from other companies. The handles are plastic instead of being cushioned with a foam handle like I've seen on other bands. Overall it's ok but not great by any means but it will do for now.
4,Its good.,"This is a good product. The resistance is good, and it works if you put it on the top of a door. The only problem I have with it is that if you try to close it in on the side of the door, the door wont close and you can't use it. So if you wanted to use this for horizontal abduction and adduction arm exercises, you probably wont be able to unless you have someone to hold it for you."
2,More Resistance,"The product itself it great, well made, but in the description it told this resistance was at a level for women starting, I do not agree with this, I am a 45 year old grandma and I am going to have to order a level, possible two levels up in resistance, this level was more for a child."
2,warning the door attachment can be dangerous if your doors have any gaps on top the door,the door attachment is poorly made I didn't notice I had a 1/2 inch gap on my doors when i placed the door attachment on top and i had a pretty long stretch when doing pull-downs with it the door attachment wedge through door and whacked me in chest leaving a very large welt from bands and door attachment so please see that your doors dont have any gaps cause ball from door attachment is made poorly and ball will slide through gap through door and most likely inflect severe pain I was lucky that it didn't hit me on face
3,Very heavy? Not really.,I purchased the purple (very heavy) resistance bands and quickly found out they do not offer as much resistance as I would have liked. Maybe these resistance bands are catered more towards girls? At least the build quality is solid.
4,The band works much better than I thought...but missing the door attachment.,"I would have given this product a 5 star if it wasnt for the missing door attachment that never came with my order.I was pleasantly surprised at the resistance this purple band gives me.If you cannot lift 15-20 pounds with freeweights comfortably, I recommend you get a resistance a bit lower than this one.I plan on taking this with me on every business/or personal trips to get my daily exercise routines in.I am working with Amazon right now to get my door attachment sent."
5,EXCELLENT!,"When I don't want to workout for a full hour i use these for a 20 minute workout. this is an excellent piece of exercise equipment. you can really get a good workout just alone with these for 20 minutes. gives you plenty of choices of workouts to choose from or create your own. the resistance is just right for me. after i've been with these for a while then i will advance to the ultra heavy. i just love these bands. great replacement instead of using my dumbells because you get to do more with these, and the exercise charts are great too. would highly recommend these blue bands!"
1,horrible exercise item,This band snapped in half the first time I used it. I was doing a normal workout when it just gave way. Both pieces then flew back and hit me right in the chest and gave me a welt like I'd never seen before. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone.
3,Better than nothing,"This is the first resistance band I have. I admit I am a little disappointed with what I got but it is not the manufacturer's fault. I like dumbbells better than resistance bands. But Resistance bands make working out possible anywhere. Good concept! I ordered a heavier one right after I received my order.I do not know what makes a good resistance band good, a bad resistance band bad. They just don't work the same as weights. The most expensive resistance band will still work weird because they are resistance bands. They are not my ideal strength training tool, but hey! It is better than nothing.Just one advice, the medium is still too light. Go straight to the heavy weight."
3,It says heavy resistance - but it's really light-moderate,I bought this to use as the next resistance level up while performing Power 90. The band offers the same or less resistance than the supplied Power 90 band
5,great resistance bands,"Good for exercising and also for everyday warm ups if a full blown exercise is not your thing. Highly recommended to anyone interested, but be up for the challenge."
4,"Alright, a bit too light","I purchased this product for p90x, however, this band turns out too be too light for most of the exercises. It does not really provide me with enough resistance. I also purchased a whole set of bands, which included black, blue bands. What I notice is, one thing that can be done if the bands are enough for certain exercises, you can stack the bands together to create more tension. Overall the quality of this band is pretty good, if the resistance is right for you."
4,"Works great, doesn't smell good","Works great, I like the pamphlet with exercises that comes along with it. However, it smells horrible and leaves that horrible plastic smell on your hands for hours."
5,worth every penny,Wasn't quite sure it would hold up to my extreme workout.Better than expected performance. Wish I would have orderedmore like this. AWESOME resistance band!!!!
2,Bands are dangerous,"I had them for one year.The strap broke when doing a curl, my fist hit my lip, leaving a at lip.Funny, but dangerous, it could have been my throat."
5,Great Quality Product,"This is a great exercise tool that you can take anywhere. I travel a lot for work, and this is an excellent way to get in a quick workout if you aren't near a gym. I highly recommend it."
4,Good product,Excellent product. Very heavy as described. Good grip too. I use these for exercising when I'm mobile on my work. Make good hotel-home workouts.Only complaint I have is it has this very heavy rubber smell (and if you touch any part of it you will smell like rubber for a couple of hours)
5,The resistance is pretty high!,"I originally bought a very light resistance band to use with my P90X workout. After completing my first 90 days, I needed an upgrade to the band. The best method way to work on back muscles is to use a pull up bar. Although the band isn't as effective as a pull up bar, this one does the job for what it is. Would be a good buy for someone who don't want to break their door frame."
5,Great Stuff!!,"These are great for a complete home workout. I order Red, Blue and Purple.I go to the Gym too. Days when I don't have time for Gym, or I'm Traveling, I use these for my workout and get a good pump.Items were delivered fast and in great Condition. Would Definitely recommend.Stay Fit!! Stay Alive!!"
5,Great product,"I purchased this exercise band after having rotator cuff surgery and I'd finished up my physical therapy.It worked great, and I continue to use it several times a week. Not only are my shoulders getting stronger, but a side benefit is that my abdomen is becoming much stronger as well as my back muscles.You do have to put the time into the exercises, but that's no biggie. It doesn't take that much time to tone up at all."
4,"Great band, very durable","I've been using this and the purple band for the past few months, and they work great. Both are very durable and have held up well. The door attachment works as expected."
3,not as good as I expected,"The tube is good, but I found the handles are too small, not very comfortable in my hands."
5,As expected,It is just as I expected. My friend has one and I just need to get one my self. I like to use it when i wake up for a feel good stretch.
1,Handles are floppy,"This seems to be the same as the ES 499R in yellow. Both have floppy handles. There are a couple of ways to get around the floppy handles. One is to use popsicle sticks jammed into the handle, suggested by someone who bought the ES 499R. Another is to use dowels. 9/16"" must be the perfect size. 5/8"" is impossible; 1/2"" is too small and the dowels don't stay put.If you can sew and want to go to the trouble, you can get some webbing and a green xertube. Take the solid handle off the green one, cut the handle on the yellow one, switch handles, and use the extra webbing to repair the handles on the yellow xertube.At this point, I don't know anything about the durability of this xertube."
5,Great exercise tube!,"My wife ordered this product to work out with on her ankles. She has a very weak left ankle (due to an injury), and tends to trip a lot. This item works great to strengthen her muscles surrounding her ankles. I have noticed an improvement in her stride with just a few weeks of exercise. Seems to be just what she needed."
5,Works well...especially when no gym,"My husband and I bought this cord (Blue, Heavy) to help us keep toned while living abroad for a year in an underdeveloped country where there was no access to gym equipment. We used it quite regularly and could work different muscles depending on how we used it. It was effective for even building up muscle. Definitely recommend for working out while traveling/on the road."
2,too stiff for me,"this product is good, but this one was too stiff for me.. i am 5'6"" and it doesn't work well... i bought the green one and it's perfect.."
4,A good band and the door attachment works well,"It's listed as very heavy and I think that's a little misleading, but it's a sturdy band. The door attachement is excellent."
3,"Exercise Band OK, but not great","This Exercise Band is OK but could be a lot better with a few simple improvements. The handles need to be a little bigger with more padding. Additionally, the door attachment ball (which holds the band to a door frame) definitely needs to be bigger. It's too small and occasionally slips through and can cause an injury. With these few simple improvements, this band would be rated 5 stars."
2,not so much,"Suppose to be heavy duty, but really the resisitance is more on the ""mild"" side,also there are 2 pressed metal pieces that help hold the handles on and one has come loose already (after a months use)I had to take some pliers and press them back together- I didnt pay much for this and you get what you pay for- wouldnt recommend"
5,"Great product, great buying experience!",Product arrived much sooner than we thought and was exactly what we ordered! Great first time experience with amazon!
1,Product broke within days.,The handle tore apart from the band after 10 - 20 uses. The metal grommet that connects the band to the handle had a sharp edge that sawed through the handle in no time. The sharp grommet was then catapulted directly at me under the tension of the band.
5,Good workout for all types,This is a great workout tool for every body. It is total customizable for easy to hard. I recommend it to any one looking for a no hassle workout that can be done almost anywhere.
5,"SPRI Xertube Resistance Band w/ Door Attachment (Red, Medium)",I use this exercise tubing at least 3 times a week. I've had it for over a year and it gets a lot of use. There are no signs of wear as of yet. Very durable. A great buy! Would highly recommend!
4,Does the job,"It's fine. Does the job, but the handles hurt my hands. There is no cushion, it's just plastic."
4,A fun read!,"Thsi is a good crime thriller.The characters are interesting andwell-drawn(DeNafria and Pavlik are great-let's see more of them!).The prose is realistic.It's well-written,fast-paced andsuspenseful.Not for the squeamish,but good fun for thrilleraddicts."
2,"Title is best part, unfortunately...","400 pounds is good, but doesn't inspire any fear from me: I've battled guys who push much more weight than that. The plot is rich on wiseguy and cop prose, but terribly disjointed. And Mr. Stella is probably a liberal anti-gun dink with no real knowledge of firearms: I don't think a bullet in either "".9mm"" or "".25mm"" is going to hurt anybody. Stick to Elmore Leonard."
3,Helpful,"The book lays out different points of view and different goals that are or can be relevant in distributions of property. Although done in a very simple way, it is nonetheless helpful to pull one out of one's own tunnel vision on the issue."
5,Some serious MUSIC WITH ATTITUDE,"To anyobdy looking forward to your average band that plays the same cliche riff... don't even bother. Any pop fans to i would consider skipp this band... Mixing a sound of memorable bass lines with a very innovative voice, the ultimate product is a very hard punch in ur face of originality... These guys are very original... to compare them i would probably say way more thecnical KOrn (era debut ""KORN"") with no rap with a melodic voice, and whisper a la Deftones. Heavy moments a la sepultura and Will Haven.... Attention this is not nu metal... if u wanna put this in a style put this in a hybridmelody with distortion as the background sound."
3,One problem...,"I like the way the watch looks and it is fully featured. My main complaint, is that the buttons are really sensitive. Half the time I look at my watch it says 4:00 AM (which is the time I have my alarm set to). The Orange button on the front is what toggles this, so anything that touches it switches to the alarm mode. This has become really annoying"
3,Deceptive Title Descriptor,"So the watch is exactly what I wanted, except it was sized for a male wrist. The item is listed as midsize, but if you actually read the watch information, it states the band size is ""unisex"" and the product description states that the watch is ""for men and women.""Any watch sized for both genders is way too big for my wrist. My understanding is MIDSIZE is meant for women/smaller wrists. I really wanted an s-shape Nike watch (with a high lap count) to conform to my wrist vs. one of the Nike Imara watches.Unfortunately, because I did not read the watch details thoroughly enough, I am having to return this watch at my own expense.Overall, 5 stars for the watch if you have a larger wrist, 1 star for a deceptive title."
5,Great watch!,"My dad wanted this watch for working out and playing sports after he saw it at Dicks Sporting Goods. Well, I bought it on Amazon for the third of the price and he's been enjoying it ever since. He love it!"
4,Nice and simple,This watch is effective and simple to use. It's perfect for timing your runs. It has many other features that can be used if needed.
4,"Great text for first-timers. Clear, with lots of cases.","Better than their 6th edition, with appropriate updates and improved chapter organization. I've used this title for four years in my intro course and the students love it."
5,I love it,I got the book in very good condition. It was delivered in a timely manner. Thanks very much.
3,Didn't fit like OEM,"My brakes are quieter, but they didn't fit like OEM. Could only use them on one side. To be honest it really wasn't worth it. I would have been fine without shims on my 91 toyota pickup. Wish I could find OEM fit shims."
5,Great Pads,"These pads are smooth with no noise, very little brake dust as well. Highly reccomended. Used on my 2005 Avalanche."
3,Tokico BZ3099 wrong flange nut shipped,"Struts look great, the only problem is Tokico sent one flange nut that was the wrong threads. One was correct the other wrongNow what?"
5,THE BEST AP BIO PREP...,"I got this book along with my other AP subject books thinking I would use them throughout the year as a supplement. Well, the AP BIO one is the only one I ended up using and it has helped me TREMENDOUSLY! My teacher knows what is on the AP exam and although her classes don't really reflect that, her tests do and I know for sure if I had just read my textbook, I would've failed all the tests. Reading the concise yet informative chapters in this review guide is the best way to prepare for the tests AND for the exam because Barron's makes it easy to understand! I would recommend this to everyone...not just for the exam but also as a supplement during the year!"
4,Very Helpful,This book was so helpful for me. I bought it for summer review and it was SO worth it. Unlike text books it gets right to the point and it was very easy to use and read. I haven't tooken my IB test yet but I know I will use this book for studying!
5,Got my money's worth on the first job,"This book was a huge help as I decided whether to go after freelancing full time and decided how to do that without getting sucked into the current market that pressures you to charge next to nothing. Lewis succinctly lays out a clear strategy for pricing. More importantly, her tips enabled me to negotiate terms (not just pricing but deadlines, story length, etc.), which allowed me to submit bids with confidence that I was neither undercharging nor overcharging. It helped me define my selling proposition and helped me realize there are clients willing to pay reasonable fees. I also gained confidence to walk away from jobs that were unprofitable or that did not advance my business goals. I ended up getting hired for a full-time writing gig, but I'd go back to freelancing in a heartbeat with confidence."
4,Fantastico!,"I simply have to sit and wonder what would've been of El Lupo if he would've been more original with the music.He's got the talent to sing well and the right emotions to express in his songs.What bothers me is how he was put forth as the masculine version of Cuban singer La Lupe.What bothers me even more is how some of the songs on this record sounds quite similar to some of La Lupe's!I honestly don't blame La Lupe for feeling a bit offended of this whole fiasco.Dare I say it that El Lupo for me is like the tropical version of Juan Gabriel. Good feeling and a good voice.Too bad this is how he'll be remembered because he could've given so much more if the emphasis was more on letting him try something a bit more original.All in all, if you're able to look past all that then this is a worthwhile record to get."
1,Odd Texture and Taste,These are not particularly sour and the texture on your tongue is like chalk. There isn't any nutritional information for calorie and sugar content. So bad that I won't even try to give them away. I wouldn't want to ruin a child's Halloween!
5,Great Book,"I bought this book because we are making a trip to some caves with my teenagers, and even that we are not going to Chauvet, it explained us very well about prehistoric life and art. Would totally recomend it. It is a very easy way to learn about a theme that if not well explained can be difficult for the kids to understand as it was too long ago."
2,A cheap knife,"This is a pretty cheap knife. I needed to add something as a filler item and this knife was the right price. Not a very nice knife, but it would probably still cut something up pretty good."
5,Faithful to the original story,"The script is virtually verbatim faithful to the original story ""the Signalman"" by Charles Dickens. Dickens had a flair for telling ghost stories in a charming way. The acting is outstanding. There is no music or special effects to assist a weak plot or poor acting. The actors are terrific and the plot is terrific. Dickens sympathized with people in humble vocations and here the movie manages to cause one to feel for the signalman who is haunted by a specter. The specter portends two horrible events, and on the third occasion portends the death of the signalman himself. It wasn't out of morbid sentiment that Dickens made this his ending, but it serves his heartfelt sentiment for those kind souls who were born into misfortune, were caste into misfortune by evil personages, or, like here, who squandered it through some series of hapless bad choices. And here is the secret of Dicken's charming storytelling."
2,the worst book i have ever read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book is very inaccurate that is my main complaint, I would not recommend it to someone who wants an exciting mystery. For example the queen of England would not spend hundreds of pounds on a maid of honor's dress! I also doubt she, a thirty six year old woman and queen of England would be best friends with a thirteen-year-old kid even though she is a lady. But the end is a little more interesting, but not exciting. On a scale of one to ten, ten being my favorite book one being the worst book I have ever read it would be a two or a three. I have read much better books but I also have read much worse books so is very low on my list of good books. This book is in my opinion rather boring and is not my taste but someone else might like it."
5,Great memories,"I have not watched the second movie on this double feature. I have watched Back To The Beach, my reason for purchase. It played very clear, and arrived very quickly. So glad I purchased."
5,good old days,"I enjoyed the movies very much, reminds me of when i was a teenager its a good movie just to kick back and enjoy as most of their movies were."
1,Too dark to read,"I never return items, but this is unusable. I can hardly read the display. I attempted to adjust the contrast setting, but it had no noticeable effect.I had a triax and love it. just dont get the black on black."
2,"Nice watch, hard to see what time it is.","The watch is great, fits fine, lots of great features but the black background and the grey numbers make it very difficult to read especially if you were running!"
2,Bland,"I wish I had liked this CD more, but I'm afraid that overall I found it boring. I think part of the problem is the decision to show how all the various artists from all over the world shared a common tradition. I think the CD would probably have interested me more if it had showcased the differences between them rather than the similarities, because after a while it all started to sound alike. Perhaps orthodoxy extends to music too. The artists seemed to be following orthodox tempos, orthodox rhythms, orthodox intervals and progressions. I found all the selections tasteful and subdued. I've now listened to it four or five times, but I don't think I'm ever going to warm up to it."
1,"Fake or just worthless, your choice.","I don't know whether I received a fake or if, as some have speculated, the cologne has been reformulated to be weaker. 5 sprays last maybe an hour. No projection at all, can't even tell that I have it on unless I'm smelling right where it was sprayed. I kept it past the return date thinking that maybe my nose just wasn't that sensitive to it but no one else can tell that I'm wearing it either. Packaging looked real. Came in the metal can, bottle looks legit. Cologne just doesn't last. Sorry Amazon, last time I buy cologne through you. $60 mistake."
2,Fragrance patent you can find cheaper,"The fragrance patent for Jean Paul Gaultier ""Le Male"" is actually the same as ""Cuba"" by Paris for a fraction of the cost. Just an fyi...."
1,Disappointed with fragrance,"Non-returnable, so if you do not like the fragrance or are allergic to it, you are stuck with an expensive paper weight. I would give it zero stars if this were a choice. I disliked it very much. My advice is to sample it somewhere before you order from Amazon."
2,Love it or hate it.,"Women must love this fragrance for it to have so many five-star reviews. I am actually sickened by the smell of it. The primary notes are chlorine, waxy vanilla candle, and a spice rack. It seriously makes me smell like I just finished three hours of swim practice.The longevity and projection are very strong, which doesn't really help when you don't like the scent. I personally think this should be classified as a chemical warfare agent and should not be used by anyone.The product design is awful and seems marketed towards females and gay males. I don't need a teal glass statuette of a male torso anywhere in my bathroom.The only tolerable excuse for wearing this scent is upon the requests of females."
2,meh,"Well, I bought this stuff after I heard it smelled unique and amazing. It does smell unique that is for sure.Some responses I have received:""You smell like syrup.""""You smell like cinnamon bread.""""You smell like the partner (a 60 yr old grizzly adams man).""""What's that cinnamon smell?""""Did you bring in pillsbury rolls?""I have not received one good comment unless you think smelling like food is a good comment.Will be trying something new very soon."
3,Its a replica,"This cologne is not really the real jean paul gaultier but its a replica of it. Which who ever that did the replica, did it well. I own myself a bottle le male but it was almost over so i decided to come to amazon to get one. It was 55 dollars which was not bad at all compared to the one i bought at macys 85dollars. Basically, the cane did not have a serial number but the bottle did, which was odd. The writting of Gaultier on the back of the bottle was completely different from the original da i own. The smell is almost the same but it doesnt last couple hours but the real ""le male"" does.And to finish, If you plan to buy it from amazon llc, remember that you can not return this item because they know it is a replica."
5,Such A Great Scent,"I placed an order with (Sephora) and with each order you get free samples, one of the samples was LeMale cologne.The smell of it is amazing, very sexy scent.It is not musky and smells clean and fresh but manly at the same time.For Valentines day I purchased the full size bottle of LeMale for mt husband and he was very happy, he loved thesample and was surprised!He loves the cologne and he normally is not a cologne wearer."
1,Not the same,"I've read all the complaints about this being a fake but have since come to find out what the real problem is. It's not Amazon. Today I just got back from returning a $85 bottle of Gaultier to Nordstrom's. The reason why was because it just didn't smell the same to me. I have been wearing Gaultier (my fav cologne) for more than 12 years. I think they may have changed the ingredients or something. After I returned the cologne at Nordstrom's I went straight to Macy's since they're both in Pentagon City Mall. I used the tester bottle and sprayed some of the Gaultier. To my dismay, it wasn't the same smell that I have come to enjoy for the past 12 plus years. I'm going to find a way to send my complaint straight to the manufacturer as soon as I get finished with this. I suggest we all do the same."
3,jean paul gaultier,The product was good but at the sametime it didnt give me that wow smell that i was looking to get from it
4,good condition,"I ordered it on-line, just because I had it before and I know how it smells, otherwise I would never buy a perfume on-line without knowing how it smells. The box and everything came in very good condition, and the size it looked even bigger that I was expecting."
5,xxxx,I Love it!!! This is the best Cologne ever!!! I get headaches from most perfumes and colognes... but not this kind. The price was great and it makes my hubby smell amazing!!!
2,A little suspicious,Well i got this cologne about 3 weeks ago and everything seemed legit at first but then i realized there was no product code on the can and the one that as on the bottle had been scratched off so it was a little fishy. i honestly don't get the same longevity and projection i get from the department store le males. it still smells like it but i feel that i payed for a watered down version of le male. I was extremely surprised since i bought it from Amazon so i thought i was in the clear for scams.
5,most compliments ever!,"ok so im not exactly brad pitt but i consistantly get compliments from random women (grocery store, gas stations, restaurants) about how good this cologne smells and they want to know what it is and where to get it for their boyfriend, husband, etc... not only can you save tons of $ on amazon but the shipping rocks too. you cannot go wrong with le male. bought a bottle for my girlfriends scent challenged brother for Christmas and he said he got compliments that night when he wore it to a party. if you want to attract women buy le male."
5,early arrival,"my husband has wanted this colonge for a while, and i have had a hard time finding it. Amazon had it in stock, ordered it, and it came about 4 days early. My husband loves it."
1,Damaged Bottle,"What a disappointment. When this was opened - which is was a birthday gift for a very special friend, I was so embarassed. The bottle top was in pieces and the one part- collar was bent so I could not put it back together. When one spends this kind of money on a cologne purchase, it should be a given it arrive intact and ready to use out of the box. Will all fragerence/cologne purchases from Amazon now need to come with ""ASSEMBLY REQUIRED"". The sad part is I can't return it due to Fed/State laws. That stinks!Jeanie"
5,Great Cologne,A friend told me about this one and I like the way it smells. I would definitely rate this up there with Calvin Klein. It last all day long with just a little use.
4,Smells great.,This is probably in my top 3 of my cologne collection. Smells great and someone always comments on how good I smell when I wear it. Definitely worth owning and worth replacing when it runs out.
1,pathetic knockoff,"this isnt jean paul gaultier. i have been using it since 2005 i know what it smells like. the bottle cap has scores on it from tampering, and the spray cap that was rolling around in the box doesnt fit properly, besides the fact that it leaked into the box and smelled up the box-so it wasnt even completely full. i am surprised because amazon usually doesnt pull this crap. even someone who never used jean paul gaultier would know something was up with this amateurish attempt at theivery. i will get my money back or i will go to small claims in santa monica, its as simple as that."
1,Don't Buy,I hastily gave this a five-star rating when i received one in the mail before use. This might be a fake. You are not allowed to return it even if you feel dissatisfied after first use. I'll never buy any cologne from Amazon again.
1,Broken,I just received this and its smashed in the metal tin in comes in and leaked all over the box and looks like it had been days because its dried on. Im upset and there isnt a place to request a replacement it says I can't return it because its liquid but nothing about a refund or anything. I just want someone to get it touch with me and get my money back.
2,Eh,Smells different than i remember. Wife didnt like the smell either. Would return if i could. Dissapointed with my purchase.
4,good,"excellent aroma that produces this perfume without but nothing to say, is very good. thank you very much. grateful for jean paul"
5,Heaven in a bottle.,I purchased this amazing cologne for my husband for the first time last Christmas 2011. Omg! When my husband puts it on I feel like jumping all over him. It has a scent that gets me everytime. It's truly amazing. If you like your man to smell strong yet sexual this is defenatly the scent you want to purchase.
3,More change,"Yep, I love the Plan, too. It's not really that surprising that Travis would want to do something different with his solo work. Not much to say, really, just that these songs are a lot more unassuming, low-fi, quiet and plainly poppy than most Dismemberment Plan fans might expect. His wit and irreverence are still in place, though. Sure doesn't feel like a home run (was it intended to be?), but I'll play it every now and then. It has the same kind of playful, quirky spirit that the first McCartney solo album had."
2,All hype but fail to deliver,"I have been told Gordon Merrick is a really good writer. I agree to a certain extent because the author successfully injected sensuality and descriptive scenery into this book.The pace of the book, on the other hand, was slow and at various times, I lost interest in continue my reading because the plot repeated itself and it therfore became predictable. The pace quickened a bit in the last few chapters and the plot thickened, it was only then readers felt more eager to find out what happened to the son, the mother, the lover and the father. Unfortunately, it's a bit too late to rescue the whole book because readers had been bored to tears before they could read to the end.Had the author cut out a few chapters and held the storyline tighter, it would have been a perfect read. There was so much potential to this book, I wish it could be better so that I would keep this book for a second read."
3,Cool model/toy but has problems!,"This model replica/toy is highly detailed for its size and took well over an hour to assemble. Visually it does justice to the famed anime show. I was very disappointed to find out though that the electronics (lights and sounds) did not work -- I tried several different batteries thinking there was something wrong with them but to no avail. I actually bought this new in box from a seller on Ebay but I know it was not their fault for the electronics not working. Hopefully there might be an easy fix or something else I forgot to switch on...but until then it's definitely not worth over $100 (luckily I did get a good deal for around that price). Make sure you ask the seller to test it first before you buy it or he/she ships it out. Oh yeah, being highly detailed with a lot of small parts, this replica is very delicate and definitely is not for kids!!!"
4,Worth a read although Finney has an irritating style,"If you've seen the 1950's film version of this book then you know the story although the ending is different. Finneys idea is one of the classics of science fiction and is just as terrifying and fresh today as it was 40 years ago. However, Invasion of the Body snatchers is difficult to read because of Finneys unusual writing style. Finney seems to write both in the past and present at the same time which is very confusing.Women also play a very traditional role in the story: making breakfast, being loyal to their men and fainting. This would be fine if the book had not been updated in the late 80's as it would be a product, and reflection, of the 1950's. However set, as the book now is, in fall 1976 the stereotyped women are very irritating.Despite these shortcomings the book is worth a read as one of SF's classics and I prefer Finneys ending to the 1950's film."
3,"GREAT animation, but the script was really lacking.","The premise of this movie was amazing-the story of Jesus told through animals that were in the stable and then there when they crucified him. They could have done so much with it and really didn't. The animation was beautiful in my opinion. I really enjoyed the last 30 minutes or so of the movie when everything came together ( I even shed a tear or two) , but a lot of it before that was a little tiresome."
2,Ok,It was an ok movie but it switched emotions too fast in my opinion for children. It could have been better if there was slower transitions between happy and sad and scared and happy again.
2,pretty cheap quality,"the second day i had this thing the wood peice that holds the strings taunt broke off, due to a bad glue job. After i super glued it back on i have had no problems"
4,Good Uke needs know how.,This is a good Uke for the price. It does need some work right out of the box though. If you tighten the tuning pegs this will hold the tune. As with all ukes the strings need to strech out. So you will be tuning it a bit the first few days. Other than that its a great instrument I've had a lot of fun learning how to play it. Not as intuitive as guitar but it makes some cool chords.
5,GREAT CD,"This cd is the best I have heard in awhile. I listen to it everyday. The line-up of artist is the greatest. They have all levels of music. From the sultry jazz to the hip hop. I have to give it to Angie Stone, Melky Sedeck, MeSchell N'deochello, Terri, and Curtis Hall for the most compelling songs on the cd. This is a cd where you don't have to skip tracks. So sit back and listen."
4,Excellent Watch For The Money,This is the third one of these I have owned in the last 10 years. They have come from different sources but are identical. Mine take a real beating and do get scratched up after a while.The metal hanger came loose on the last one but I just took it to the shop and banged it closed with a hammer. The compass is not very useful but I don't use it anyway. I also found the battery a bit tricky to change. Overall it serves my purposes well and if I have to buy a new one every 4 or 5 years that's fine.
5,love it,"is everything that was described love it, my sweetie works on equipment so he cannot wear a watch and he says this is perfect."
2,Tastes ok but has bits of shells,"The taste is good, but I found myself biting down on small bits of lobster shells more often than acceptable. This made me not want to finish my bowl of soup."
2,Too watery,"It is ok soup, but I expected more, as I love lobster bisque and tried so many different kinds in different places. This one is very watery and I could not find any lobster there. I guess it is ok for the price, but I would NEVER buy this brand of the lobster bisque again."
3,It's good for canned soup.,"For canned soup, it hits the spot decently. There's definitely some lobster flavor and small chunks in it. However, the whole thing tastes a little on the fishy side. If I was served this in a restaraunt I think I'd walk out."
2,As far as canned soups go,"As far as canned soups go this is ok. I was disappointed with the texture, extra unexpected bits (shell pieces) and overall quality. Having been spoiled by living in Maine for 20 years before relocating to the south, I tried different brands of canned bisque. I have come to the realization that Lobster Bisque is best when made fresh."
1,Bad tasting soup,"This is one of the worse tasting soups I've ever eaten. I hated it, and now I have a full case. It tastes bitter to me, and my husband wouldn't even try it. Only my cat was trying to reach it on the counter!"
3,Lobster Tomalley=health risk,"I advise you to do your own web search to determine how the health risk could affect you. The tomally functions as the lobster's liver and pancreas. However, even in the cold Scottish waters, dioxin and other harmful agents have been present and there are warnings for the general public. I was disappointed to discover this information, so I only ordered the mushroom and seafood flavors."
1,Unreadable and unworkable.,"I thought I'd bought a slick little GPS. Unfortunately, it would not lock onto a satellite. Tech support had me ""reset"" the unit and it worked briefly before making uncommanded switches to Comm 1, disabling navigation. While it was working, it was unable to compute simple nav problems. ""Roads do not appear to connect"" was the mantra. I also could see that the comprehensive nav data base did not reflect changes to a major local highway, several years old. To top it off, the screen is totally unreadable in sunlight and barely readable in a car. I'm an experienced lover of GPS(auto & jet aircraft), but had to return this box for a refund."
1,decent hardware but software and tech support suck,"I bought the PIN100 because it was a fairly affordable system. However, it seems like you get what you pay for. The hardware is ok, except for the tiny SD card that doesn't even hold the maps of a single state. The SmartST V2 software on the other hand has lots of shortcomings.One of the problems is that you cannot back up your data files. That means when the battery dies, you loose everything. You need to enter all you destinations again. The only thing worse than that fact is the attitude of their tech support. Their answer was: ""Unfortunately this is not a feature offered on the PDA version of SmartST .. sorry for the inconvenience. Keep that PDA charged!"".Another thing that sucks is that they don't offer any upgrade to version 3, which fixes most problems. If you want it, you have to pay full prize. I don't understand why they still sell the PIN100 with such a low-capacity SD card and their old crappy SmartST V2 software."
1,Not worth buying it unless it comes with SmartST V3 software,The SmartST V2 software that comes with this unit really sucks and doesn't have much features. The next version seems to have them but costs $100. They should have given it cheaper for current users for upgrade atleast.
2,Not User Friendly,You have to input your address search twice to get this unit to make it work; there have been a few times it will not find the address that you may be looking for in its database.If you try to run both the navigation software and all the other database software it seems to slow down its processing speed.If you ever lose battery power completely you will have to reload the navigation software all over again! I do NOT particularly recommend this unit (even though I own one!)
1,This thing totally sucks !!!,"Horrible software - very hard to enter addresses. Lets say you're looking for restaurants, you'll need to enter a 'Area'. So you enter a city - it will bring up several options with the same city name. You don't know which to choose. It cannot serach for POIs based on the current location.Worst gizmo investment I ever made."
1,navman pin100,"I completely feel disappointed about this product. First it took at least 3 minute to locate GPS satellite. This product can direct you to the destination you selected and only to the street but not to the house number. Many time this product brought me 2miles off the house number. By the way, the address is not US format which made you feel very annoying to select right address. I recommand to return for refund if you can. I have sent questions to this company but got a strange reply."
4,"Good product, but the software still lacks.","This product is great. The software still lacks some features. The maps aren't that detailed. Microsoft streets and trips 2003 work great with it. I agree with the previous reviews about entering an address. It takes some time, nothing like Microsoft. The 3d imaging are awesome. Overall, it's a good product and hope to see more software enhancements in the future."
1,Mine Quit working also,"My Model IDM-9520 worked great for about two movies. Now it is all I can do to get thru one movie. It will freeze after about 10-15 min of run time. Only way to recover from this is to shut down and try and reload the movie(which does not always work). Great price, but definatly not worth the aggravation."
1,2 of these died in less than 24 hours,Warning. This product is named INITIAL becuase it only works initially! We bought 2 of these for our kids for Christmas. Both worked all day yesterday (about 3 DVDs watched on each). Both units will not load a DVD today. 1 unit quit working first thing this morning and one quit this afternoon. I'm going to try again and hope that I got 2 lemons and their replacements will be okay.
1,Don't BUY,"I agree with one of the previous posts. Do not buy an Initial Dvd player. I bought mine at the end of November for a road trip. It worked great. We used it a few more times since then, but recently noticed the screen would suddenly go out. Today, I tried to power it up using both the car adapter and the regular plug and nothing happened. My husband tried to power it up and still nothing. So after only 6 months I have to replace my portable dvd player."
2,"Very ""moody"" player","I bought this for my son when we go on long car/plane trips. We have had it for about 7 months and it has been ""moody"" since day 1. It works when it wants to work and it skips when it wants to skip. Some movies play fine and have minimal skipping, but other movies skip every few minutes. I have tried cleaning the discs and as well as the player and it still skips. It is almost impossible to watch a complete movie on this device. However, it does keep my son happy on trips so I guess I got what I wanted. The skipping doesn't seem to bother my son who is so happy just to be watching a movie although it would really bother me. So think twice about buying this if you are someone who gets annoyed easily....or else you will throw it out the window."
1,Don't be Fooled,"I bought this because of the price, and got what I payed for. It worked for three movies and froze up, then would not load anything after that. Thnking it was a lemon, I returned it only exchanged it for a second one, only to have it happen again after five movies played.Finally, I exchanged it for an APEX for the same price, and have not had a moments trouble for 6 months.Sure the price is good, but you can get so much more for your money."
1,Don't buy it,"Same as the others, it worked for 3 days and then stopped working, it would freeze in the middle of a movie, we upgraded to the Audiovox 7 inch and are much happier."
1,"If it sounds too good to be true, then it probibly is.","The audio/video quality on this little guy is great. However, here's where Initial Technologies rips you off. The disk mechanism only lasts for two days. Save up for a Sony, Tashiba, Philips, JVC, or Panasonic. RCAs only last for a few months. They also have great audio/vidio quality, but very poor disk mechanisms. Note that amazon.com currently does not stock portable DVD players by Sony, Philips, or JVC. I don't remember seeing many Tashiba portable DVD players either. Amazon.com does have a good selection in many other catagories, but not portable DVD players."
3,Good Calipers for Low Budget,"The Slim Guide calipers are a decent alternative to the Lange or other, higher end calipers. While not quite as accurate, you will get a similar reading on this $20 version as you do on the $150-$300 calipers, as long as you are a reliable, experienced tester.While I recommend spending the extra money for the best calipers that produce the most accurate results, these aren't bad for someone just starting out."
4,Most accurate way to measure body fat percentage,the skinfold caliper is one of the closest you can ever get to an accurate measure of your body fat percentage.. all the other electronic devices at gyms do not really work.
5,Great product!!!!,This product was better then I expected. I am looking forward to purchasing other products from this vender.
2,Pinch pinch pinch,"Using calipers to measure your persentage body fat turns out to be a very inaccurate method if you're not an experienced pincher. The first time my husband gathered a skinfold for the tricep measurement and pinched with the caliper jaws, I was wondering whether he was getting back at me for something! Furthermore, the measurements are rather erratic even though I try my best to measure according to the booklet. I think I will rather use it for punishment than for measuring my fat!"
5,Great Product and Price!!!,"This product was delivered in a timely fashion, and is as described. It is made of plastic, but is very durable. Comes with an instruction manual that makes taking measurements very easy. Definitely recommend."
4,Insect Trust - self-titled (Ascension),"Originally released in 1968, as until fairly recent, I've vaguely ever heard of this two-album folk / art rock ensemble. Tunes here that did it for me were ""Miss City Fun"" (with it's stunning & strong female vocals), the seven-minute heartfelt ""Special Rider Blues"", the well-played folk gem ""Morning Song"" and the beautiful ""Going Home"". Wanted to make sure and mention that a couple of this lp's CD reissue's tracks that stood out to me were the upbeat ""Been Here And Gone, So Soon"" and ""Declaration Of Independence"" (great flute work). Might pull in fans of Spirit, Fairport Convention, Holy Modal Rounders and possibly some Amon Duul II or Gong followers."
1,A change for the worst,"Due to merengue becoming such a force in music, Fania recurred to new sound to try to fight back. Unfortunately, they turned to a disco-ish sound as they did with ""Delicate and Jumpy"" and other numerous albums during 5 or 6 years. Social Change does incorporate some jazz elements such as piano and soft horns, and I actually enjoy jazz (specially latin jazz)but, this album to me is a miserable failure in many aspects. As I said earlier, its sound is too reminiscent of disco and not even Gato Balbieri could save this album. I would definitely stay away from this one as this is not the usual Fania."
2,Extremely partisan hatchet job,While I learned some new and interesting facts about the vice-president the overall tone of the book was highly offputting. It is clear that this was a hatchet job by an extreme partisan. This is NOT a real biography. I will continue to await a serious biography of this important political figure.
1,"How about giving us a review, Mr. Tom Bombadil ""Jedi""","I didn't read the book, but Tom Bombadil ""Jedi"", neither did you. If you wish to comment on a book you read, write a review about the BOOK. If you have a political comment, go to the proper website to write about it there."
4,Color of Welfare,"The Color of Welfare does an excellent job of tracing the evolution of the U.S. welfare state. Quadagno explores the major programs of the welfare system. The main conclusion is that racism was the major factor in the development of policies designed to help those in need. Quadagno chronicles the political games and their impact on the services to the poor. Each major program or department responsible for the distribution of welfare benefits is explored and critiqued. Overall, a good source of background knowledge of the maze of the programs and benefits that make up the welfare system."
5,one of the best authors in the world to date,"I love all her work and the effort that this author has put into giving women the strength and courage to face their problems with knowledge and wisdom. Any of you women out there that want knowledge on the psychological dynamics of groups and relationships give her a try. This is for men too, after all the goal is for humanity to be united under respect, understanding, empathy, appreciation and love."
2,Dearth of Math Problems. Look Elsewhere.,"I was a loyal princeton review customer when I bought this book. Back when I took my SAT in high school, I used almost every prep book. PR was the best by far.With the GRE, I decided to trust PR for my prep again. The vocab is fantastic, as always, but you could probably do better with their little book, Word Smart for the GRE. The math review, on the other hand, leaves something to be desired. There are way too few problems and the practice exercies and tests were far too easy. The test is much harder. You are probably better off getting the book that ETS puts out, Practicing to Take the GRE General Test.The book is heavy on fluff (that you can probably find on the GRE website) and thin on substance.Best of luck."
2,Cracking the GRE Chemistry test--2nd edition,"Don't buy this book!I have the 2nd edition (the edition prior to the 2005), and it is full of obvious errors, in both the study section and the answer key! If you use this as your study aid, you will learn to do things incorrectly. The Princeton Review needs to proofread their study guides before publishing them. This study guide is a disservice to chemistry applicants everywhere."
2,don't even bother,"ok... don't even bother studying for GRE's. waste of time. really. when you register to take the test, they send you a cd with sample test. look at that to get an idea of the format and type of questions. that is good enough. don't even bother studying the vocabulary either. hardly any of the words will appear and you will forget all of them by the test day anyways and none of them will be remembered later on in life. Also, the words they ask in the exam- noone even uses! so it's not even a useful life skill. and if you do end up using the words you learn in the GRE book, nooone will understand you, which defeats the whole purpose of communication. ok that's it. just be well rested, sharp and awake. you'll do better that way:) there are better ways to spend time."
5,GRE is Greeeaat,"I love this book, It is the answer to my prays. It presents the material in a way that is very easy to understanding. It gives an example of a problem and then shows the steps to solve the problem."
4,Great to have around,I keep bettas and sometimes if you forget about the water changes they can get sick with a variety of diseases having maracyn around and using the correct doses can definitely help the life of your fish
4,Works For Me,"I have to admit that I don't own a lot of the OM series, but the few that I have I am in love with. On this set, these songs stand out: (in no particular order)Jazzanova - Let Your Heart Be FreeKaskade - MaybeAmp Fiddler - I Believe In You (done up by the infamous Bugz in the Attic, oh yeah!)Kaskade - Steppin Out (Chillout Mix)Harlem Zip Code - Where Will You Go (I really love this hip hop beats backing a 'lounge' singer)The song I least liked is the last one by Lornalee, 'Tu Es Le Seul'. Just wasn't feelin' it.These are my personal favs and I think the whole cd is very good. I recommend this as a buy."
4,Revealing and entertaining,I've seen these bands in concert but never thought about how touring may effet their loved ones. This is an interesting/entertaining look at how being an parent can be the best thing that can ever happen to you.
5,Awesome movie,Totally recommend this to everyone. My tattooed punk rocker husband especially liked it since we just had our son and this movie was really relatable to him. Good movie
5,Awesome movie about fatherhood,"Whether you like punk music or are a parent or just love really good documentaries, this movie made me laugh and cry and absolutely made me look at punk rockers in another light"
5,Wow,This film was great! I can honestly say I was smiling the entire time I was watching it. It was a feel good documentary that gave incredible understanding what these musicians lives are like. I feel like I have learned some insight on parenthood. The featured artists were so lovable. I cannot say enough about this film. It is definitely worth the price. I wish I could give more stars.
5,Brilliant movie! A must see for anyone who appreciates punk rock.,"Pre-ordered this and received it yesterday. If you are a die hard Pennywise fan I STRONGLY recommend this along with Jim Lindberg's book Punk Rock Dad. I got a little teary eyed and managed to laugh my face off. You don't have to be a die hard punk rock fan to enjoy it. Other band members are from Rise Against, Rancid, NOFX, Black Flag, Adolescents, Vandals, Blink 182 & even Tony Hawk. Really enjoyed seeing this point of view of their lives. Great soundtrack of course too ;)."
5,Interesting movie about punk band members/skate boarders who are now fathers,This movie follows some well know punk band members and boarders as they juggle being a father while maintain their individual personalities.
4,Sentimental.,"This was actually a lot more touching than I thought it would be...it has the fun little moments you would expect and a good bit of musical substance, but there are some pretty personal moments in here, too. Definitely worth a look for anyone with a good taste in music and in interest in the behind the scenes ;)."
4,I can see some STARZ,"Made in USA in 1999, Serial# DCC-0015-CD, Playing Time 69:27Formed after the breakup of STARZ, HELLCATS' first output was an EP (available as a 2-on-1 with STARZ' P**s Party). Soon afterwards, their first full-length album (called here ""Hellcats II"") came out.Is the music original? No. Is Richie Ranno the best guitarist on the planet? Don't think so. Is it a masterpiece of production? Nope. BUT THEY ROCK!This disc contains all 9 tracks from the album (though ""Without You"" has been edited by about 15 seconds), and loaded with 8 bonus tracks, as catchy(if not more) as the rest of the regular album. From the opening notes of the CD, ""Hold"" grabs your attention: good hooks, simple and raw, basic but solid in your face rock and roll, and the only track with keyboards.I like STARZ; I like HELLCATS; I like RRG; it's american rock that makes you feel good; you just want to pick up a guitar and jam with the guys in the band. Maybe I'm just a wanna-be-rocker!"
4,What a good dance song,"I remember this song coming out around Halloween and I loved it. I played it at every party I went to, even when it wasn't Halloween. Unfortunately I lost the album years ago and was never able to find it again. I'm glad that it's not lost, so why isn't this on CD? Hint."
1,Save your money,"This 2-pack movie DVD was a disappointment. Poor Dudley Moore suffered through these cheesy 80's clunkers. You're not going to find the best of him here. For that, save your money and look up anything by ""Derek & Clive"" or the original ""Bedazzled"" along with Peter Cook. That's when Dudley was shining at his comedic best."
3,I love this movie but...,"Crazy People was an awesome movie! I remember watching it back in the 90s and loved all the silly ads they came up with, THIS version of the movie cut out some of my favorite ads and I'm a bit ticked off about it. I bought this version thinking it would be the same but the Hummer ad was no where to be seen. Now I am wondering if I'll have to go find an old VHS copy to get the original comedy in full."
5,Great Fun! Dudley Moore at his best.,"My purchase of this DVD was mainly for the film, ""Crazy People"". It has been a family favourite for years. In fact, when family members are in the car together and someone spots a Volvo it immediately elicits...""Buy a Volvo, They're Boxy But Good"" from the movie.Best Defense was a new one for me but still quite enjoyable."
5,If you are a Dudley Moore fan these are for you!,Crazy People is the best! I'm a Dudley Moore fan and that is why I bought this because it's a great deal for the 2 movies!
3,shorty63,"It is an ""ok"" supplement to the book. It does provide extra practice for the student and the teacher to use. However, it would be more helpful if there were answers provided so the student knows if they are working the problems correctly."
3,NO ANSWER KEY!!!,"For the price, Can't beat. Nice content, nice problems, BUT NO ANSWER TO CHECK. Very disappointed because the site didn't said so. Cannot believe this and I have to return. Other than the answer problem, it's great for a three star."
5,Prentice Hall Mathematics: Geometry.,"Very good book,fast service. My grandson is very glad to have this book, the first one we ordered never came. Thank you for you great service."
3,Downloaded Video does not have menu!,Be careful if you are planning on downloading the video because you do not get the option to choose your work out. You will have the 45 minute workout but that is it. The sections to show you how to use the chair are at the end if you need it.The video is okay. The stretching felt good and it is a nice way to start the day. Definitely not a workout.
4,Peaceful pregnancy,"This is a great workout video for pregnant woman who needs a moment to connect with her baby. It relaxes all your muscle and calms you down, especially helpful if you have trouble relaxing. It's important to relax yourself during pregnancy. I alternate this exercise with 10 min solution- prenatal Pilate. I love the balance it gives me."
3,wrong color shown on the photo,"Those who are considering to purchase this product should keep in mind that the product is actually dark in color, not light, as shown on the photo. Also, when I received the order, the wood was chipped on one of the ""hands,"" so the quality is not the best."
2,Keep your books clean,"the book was in good condition like the owner stated. Little bent corners, no highlighting. Except they did not say that it must have gone through a mud puddle and it was not cleaned very well. It had pieces of dirt and grass stuck in the creases along with mud smears on the beginning pages."
3,Interesting but Lacking.,This is not a book but a tiny essay.This man's research is incomplete and most of what he says is based on superstition and lack of observation but he has a point. Since the dawn of mankind fasting has been used as a tool to purify the organism and that remains true to this day. His fruit diet is not a healthy way to live but it works when applied once or twice a year to keep the system in check.
3,Look For Better Choice,"Fasting can be very healing for the body... there are different types of fasts. Most common are water fast, juice fasts, and some eating of veggies or fruits. This book however, isn't that helpful in information on fasting and the benefits for the body. An internet search on fasting will provide more information on fasting, the impact on the body, the healing benefits. Or you can get other books on fasting that will be more helpful. The important thing is that fasting can be so healing for us... it is worth learning about and finding the best way for you."
2,not the best translation,"For some time, I used this English translation in a course I teach in translation. It was never satisfactory, but for a long time it was the only one available. Now there is a new one, skillfully and thoughtfully translated by Rosemary Lloyd and published by Oxford. (Also offered by Amazon; check the list.) I would recommend this one over the Cassandra edition. David A. Powell"
5,Fascinating book and excellent translation,"This book is excellent for those who want to be able to read the poetry of the VIth Dalai Lama in clear and simple english. However what is especially good about this translation is that the poetry does not lose its haunting beauty in translation. Also this book offers a fascinating overview of the VIth Dalai Lamas life and times placing the poems in context. Explanatry notes are also offered for each poem, which assist with understanding the more obscure verses. All in all this is an excellent book that I highly recommend!"
3,Different,"This thriller is a difficult book to review. It starts off with our main character being asked to take over the just recently vacated position of judge. Apparently, the previous judge was murdered. Tim did not get his position without a price and the price is that he has to ""vote"" a certain way in certain cases.This does not sit well with Tim and he enlists the help of a former lover to help him take down the whole thing.The storyline is great and the plot is logical and keeps you interested, but there was something about the whole tone of the book that just turned me off. I think its the writing style. The whole book felt like it was written in a standoff, once removed voice. The whole writing style felt stilted to me. It is difficult to explain, but I just felt as though the author was writing this book in the third person (even though it is only partly like that).A good read, but could have been deeper."
5,Diamond in the Rough,"This album is strictly one of a kind. I had the original vinyl when it first came out and played it until the needle wouldn't stay in the groove anymore. What a thrill it's out on CD! Especially check out ""Stone Fox Chase"" an amazing bluegrass/African drum dance groove. You won't believe it's over 30 years old. As an owner of several thousand pieces of vinyl and CDs, I put this one in my top 10."
3,Still available as of June 2012,"Up-tempo banjo-pop, good musicians, mostly instrumentals.If you are not looking for a ""collectible"" this is still available as a CD-R on CDbaby for 20 bucks plus their excessive shipping fees."
4,Read Acts 10 if you think Paul was on the roof.,SKETCHES OF JEWISH SOCIAL LIFE and other classic works by Alfred Edersheim have gone out of copyright and are available for free online if you can't afford to buy here.
5,This book is concise and a wealth of bibliography.,"This is a collection of articles about the history, meaning and development of the liturgy of the Roman Church. But, this book is not limited to the interests of only Roman catholics. This book appeals to all denominations interested in Christian worship and its developement."
2,Power cables do not work well,The power constantly cuts off if you barely move the player. It only worked for about 2 weeks.
2,Useful in one way...,"I agree with the general opinion of those commenting on this book...I just purchased a new F5 and picked up this book at the register (it was shrink wrapped for obvious reasons). It is nothing more then a rewrite of the user manual, pure and simple. However, my wife has been showing a growing interest in photography and read this book cover to cover (where she never would have read the users manual) and benefited from it. It has a non-manual style and as such did have value to someone who traditionally won't or doesn't read manuals, but should. No value (or none I found) personally, but my wife did, by default, actually read a manual end to end ;-)"
3,Nikon F5,"General opinion and not really an review. I think this book is nothing more than a well packaged manual. In fact, I don't see anything more than what I can get from the provided manual."
1,Rip-off,"You'll know what a rip-off really means once you've bought this book and read it. A revised edition is imperative, probably written by somebody like Moose Peterson. The guide book on the F90X written by him was excellent. I hope the revised edition will be made available at a highly discounted rate to those who bought the original edition."
2,not really appropriate for the caliber of F5 users,"This would be a good reference book for the early wealthy amateur who bought a camera far beyond their capabilities. No photographer who can really take advantage of what the F5 has to offer would learn anything new by reading this book. Then again, if you own a lesser camera and want to drool on the extra features of the F5, this book may be your perfect match!"
2,Contac,I was disappointed in the product. I'm used to having Contac being 12-hour relief. This one was only 4 hours. The description for the product did not indicate the time length.
4,REMEMBER ME,If you are a Lesley Pearse fan you will love this book!Captivating from beginning to end its a must read for all her fans.
3,I waited anxiously,I am still reading it and as soon as i finish i will definetely purchase another one!
5,I read my husband's book!,"My heart went out to these boys who perservered against such odds. This book is a life lesson that tells us what the human spirit is capable of when a dream is within its grasp. Woody Falgoux writes with creative enthusiasm about these talented giants, and the reader gets to know each one on a personal level. Their dream becomes ours, and you can't put the book down."
4,A bittersweet story of dreams,The story of ten undrafted rookies turning up to the New Orleans Saints training camp of 2000 makes for a good read. The author follows their trails and tribulations and documents their despair at times.The individuals involved are generally people one can admire in their commitment to the sport and the sacrifices that they are prepare to make to achieve the near impossible dream of playing for the NFL.The author doesn't shirk his writing duties to gloss over various issues he encounters and this makes for a better read than some books which are a little too full of praise for everyone involved.Easy to read and enjoyable.
3,Huw Lloyd Langton - 'Chain Reaction' (Allegro),"As much as I tried to thoroughly enjoy this solo effort by the on-again and off-again Hawkwind guitarist, I simply didn't get much out of it as I might have expected. Don't get me wrong for 'Chain Reaction' is decent. Personally, I liked his 'On The Move...Plus' and 'Night Air' CD's better (see my review of both). Some of the tracks here like ""Sleep Easy"", the title cut ""Chain Reaction"" and ""5 To 4"" offers some fine playing and such, but I'm afraid this disc is just too bluesy for me. According to the liner notes, only two players appear on this CD, Huw Lloyd-Langton - guitar & vocals with John Clark - drums & vocals. Hear it for yourself and you might get more out of it than I did."
3,It's okay....,"After reading the reviews on the page for this page, I decided to see one for myself at a local CompUSA. The design is great, small and trendy, but it does have several drawbacks.The notebook sleve, as others have already mentioned, is layered with a thin piece of felt. While it provides a nice and fuzzy place for the notebook, it is thin and suspect to easy ripping.Second, the backpack straps on this bag are very unpadded and make the backpack rest on the upper back. Depending on how you like to wear backpacks, this may impact your like or dislike of the prodduct.Lastly, the bag is small. This is not a bag a student can carry wtih all his or her boosk inside. It's made for a notebook and some accessories, with maybe a couple files or small books. For something similar to this but with more space for textbooks, you may want to look at the Amazon.com Messenger Bag."
5,Best Laptop plus Bag ever,"I have many laptop bags and this one is the best for traveling on planes (as well as most anywhere else). It is the one bag that is made to easily slip under the seat in front of you. The three ways to carry it are fantastic, especially as a backpack. It is comfortable and convenient to get the straps out. f you want to look less kid-like or hiker-like going to a meeting, use the shoulder strap or handle. Best of all, when on a trip and want some R&R, dump out all of your work paraphenalia, and your laptop, and use it as a terrific backpack. I couldn't be more pleased with it."
2,"Great design, but ""fragile""","I bought this product because I'm impressed with the feature it has, and as a customer support engineer I need the computer case that has a professional look at the customer place but should be comfortable enough to carry on the street. Most of the time I carry it as a backpack. But it's not tough as it should be. It last only 1 month and the inner side between the padded computer compartment began to tear. Because it has a lifetime warranty, I went back to the shop and got a new one. After a month plus again the inner side (I will say it as a weakness) is starting to tear and then I will go back to the shop to replace it."
2,"Good looking, comfortable, holds lotsastuff, but too fragile","This is a good-priced, cool-looking, spacious, comfortable to carry bag. It converts to a backpack and the shoulder strap and handle are super padded.Bad news: I went through two of these in six months, the second very nicely provided as a replacement for the first by Kensington for free. They both ripped out at one of the outer seams in the main non-padded compartment. I have a haul of a commute via bus and NYC subway and the bag got shoved around a lot. The exposed seams tend to snag on any available sharp surface and rip out.Be nice to it and this could be a good bag, but if you need a bag that can be abused, stay away."
2,"A great design, but ""fragile""","I bought this product because I'm impressed with the feature it has, and as a customer support engineer I need the computer case that has a professional look at the customer place but should be comfortable enough to carry on the street. Most of the time I carry it as a backpack. But it's not tough as it should be. It last only 1 month and the inner side between the padded computer compartment began to tear. Because it has a lifetime warranty, I went back to the shop and got a new one. After a month plus the inner side (I will say it as a weakness) starting to tear again and then I will go back to the shop to replace it."
3,Brown trim attractive but wears off.,Everything is great about this bag except the brown trim wears off rapidly - leaving it still functional but shabby looking.
4,Great bag at a good price,"I purchased this bag for my son for Christmas; he is a database analyst for world COM and takes his laptop everywhere. This bag is snappy looking and just the right size for a laptop, and accessories."
5,"Excellent, excellent, excellent","What a great book. Gary Smith isn't a writer, he is a poet. His articles are something to be savored, not skimmed. Each and every word has a purpose. In today's world of ""blurbs"" it is refreshing to read a book by someone who has honed his craft so superbly you never want to finish reading the book. He's not a sportswriter, he's a writer of human nature. By far the best book of collected articles I have ever read."
5,Best tool made!,"I travel and teach doll and animal making, so I have always had to bring several tools with me for bending and cutting wire armatures. This tool does it all in just a ""flip"".This is the second one I have had, so now I keep one in my travel box all the time, and one in my studio.This tool is well made and a joy to use."
2,Handy but not durable,"They are incredibly handy, especially the small ones with needle nose and side cutters. Unfortunately I broke the small ones cutting the wire in a dryer vent, they just aren't built to be very durable. There does not appear to be any warranty information on them either."
2,Not worth the cover price: not even worth the Amazon price.,"Tyler Volk, I'm sure, had a good idea when he started to write this book. But i think it got lost along the way. He appears to be a brilliant man, with excellent credentials and positions at presitigous universities, but somehow, authoring isn't his forte.It's sectioned off by shape, really. The book examines why things are. For example: why is a leaf flat. The answer: the shape offers the most surface area for light absorbtion in contrast to volume.But while this sounds solidly proven, and it would be interesting to hear a further analysis of nature's chosen shapes and other things: It's too hypothetical for me, and not enough established thought.I pass this judgement about halfway through the book, which i'm just barely making progress in, becuase it doesn't make me want to pick it up later when i have to put it down and do something else. It can't hold my interest.One would do better buying something else."
2,Not worth my time or money ...,"Volk is a case of a PhD who may be intelligent yet lacks the ability to write effectively. I learned very little from this book, and when one does come upon some intriguing information his writing style and thought sequences are so convoluted that the entire text is rendered useless. I couldn't even finish the last chapter due to sheer boredom..."
3,So What?,"I initially found this book intriguing, but after a while I became quite bored with it. So there are many things in the world that are round, flat, tubular, bordered, etc., and these can be metaphors for other things. Ok, so what? I kept waiting for the author to make his point, but the descriptions just went on and on.This book may have some value as a source of pretext for meditation or creativity exercises, or those seeking material for artistic collages. There are some short passages that were evocative. But overall I didn't get much from this to justify the time I spent reading it."
4,Great enterainment for kids!,"The kids really like playing this game! The boards and chips are made with a thick cardboard, so they will last a long time. The DVD is easy to use, and the only criticism I have is that it slowly changes the numbers, but you can choose to change them quicker by using the remote. The slower number calling is for the younger kids, but even my 5 year old doesn't take as long as they give. You can play standard, blackout or pattern bingo, so it is very versatile. Also, if the kids don't know numbers, they use the characters and color coding, so my 3 year old plays along too! You can also easily review what was called already and there are clips of their favorite shows about 1 - 2 times a game (they can be skipped if you don't want to watch them) followed by a wild space (choose a number in a certain row). A friend's child came over, and begged his mom to get this game for him (5 years old). Great game!"
4,We like to play this on rainy nights...,The kids have fun with us playing this DVD Bingo game when we are forced indoors by weather. My kids are 3 and 6 and let me state that they do not yet own the video game boxes that their older peers own. You know which ones I am referring to so consider that other kids may find this a bit lame in comparison but for the price it has been decent family entertainment.
2,I don't like it,"Even the second book sent to me was damaged, but I kept it because I fiqured that they all must be. I threw away the jacket because it was so badly damaged. You should let us know if the books you have in stock are damaged so that we can judge for ourselves whether or not we want to buy them."
2,Panoramic story squashed into a little box,"I have to admit disapointment in this movie. I did not realise it was edited from a much longer mini series. Whoever cut this, should hang their head in shame for I'm sure the original edition was much more worthy of praise. This film was ruined by shambolic editing. Their was too much going on over a long period of time. It could not be crammed into 130 mins. Arn and loved one was going through trials and tribulations at 100 mph. The makers of this film should have done the entire mini series on DVD - that, I'm told, is over 5 hours long. It would have been much more gripping - of this I'm certain."
3,Five Hours Cut Into Two,"This was a movie that felt designed to be epic, but it left me wanting more. As it turns out, this movie was originally filmed as two 2.5-hour movies, not this 2 hour version. That explains why many characters felt woefully underdeveloped and why the plot sometimes left me scratching my head.The acting is good, and the plot is intriguing. The battle scenes, particularly the final one, leave much to be desired in terms of realism. Additionally, too many modern phrases make their way into a movie set in the 12th century.Overall, I enjoyed this as a light action film, but I would have loved to see what the production team did in the original two movies, rather than this abridged version."
5,Excellent Film! Best of the Year!,"This film was very well made and written! The cinematography was also excellent! I highly recommend this film to anyone who is interested in films about the Crusades. An action movie with a meaningful love story as it's foundation. Sensitive moment, High Action Battlefield scenes, good writing and plausible story...It has everything we want! Excellent and intelligent Date-Movie for you and your girl! Now I'm interested in the book!"
3,"Good, but not great.","The film looks great. Lots of large sets and scenery. Story line, Typical Crusades yarn but centered around an unfortunate romance. The film drags after 45 minutes. The yawns begin at about 40 minutes, but then the excitement returns with battles, followed by a few more yawns, then the ending. Wow!"
3,"very far away from ""Kingdom of heaven'","it is an ""ok"" movie, made with little budget.so don't expect too much for the final result and for sure it is nothing to be compared to ""kingdom of Heaven"""
1,.ARN,"All the language is not in english and you have to read what they are saying.This makes it hard to follow the movie and able to keep up with it.I would like to get one that all the language is in English.I know they are because ones that only speak English, I rented one from Red Box before I bought this one from you.I would like one in English only."
2,arn,i think it would be a great movie except almost all of it is subtitles i wish when people give reviews they would mention it because i do not like movies you have to read the story
1,It is NOT in English,"A rather interesting film, but the soundtrack is in at least six different languages. English is spoken for maybe 5 minutes of the film. I personally don't care to be deceived by a description on Amazon that says it is an English language film. The conscept of the film isn't bad, but it is the typical Euro-Trash, ""Art"" film that lacks much in the way of entertainment and is long on being a piece of ART."
1,not likeable,"disappointed about this movie. Read the cover of it and it sounds good. The only part I liked is when it ended. To many different languages and I don't speak Dutch, Norwegian, French and others. To hard to keep track of what is going on while reading subtitles"
1,Less than 1/2 of a film...,"I just got through watching this film on Netflix and came to Amazon to check the reviews because there were so many ""back & forths"" time wise and location wise in the film, I had trouble following the plot.As I read the reviews, I found this was cut down from 6 hours to a little more than 2.I was going to buy the blu-ray until I read the reviews.It's very disapointing that Amazon is so sneaky in its discription of the film. I feel if Amazon was honest, nobody would buy this."
2,Only the last fighting scene is good. The love between the two main characters is abrupt,"I rented the international version of this film.Only the last fighting scene is good. It's exciting, fierce, and on a large scale. All the others are so brief that I can't feel any thing.The love between the two main characters is so abrupt that it does not stir up my emotion at all.The only good thing about this movie is it successfully portrays Arn's courage and compassion. He fought on even though he fatally wounded. He spared his enemies' lives when he had the chance to kill them.According to ""Cannucklehead Film Addict"", one of the other reviewers, this movie was a TV mini series. This international version is about two-third shorter than the original. No wonder, the scenes showing the love between 2 main characters are so short. What a waste!"
3,ok at best,Was ok but product description clearly states English when it is in Sweedish with English sub titles
4,Collector's Edition in Australia and New Zealand,After hiring Arn The Knight Templar it was disappointing as I could see that this was a much longer movie. It turn out to be two movies. I would not purchase it as it was disjointed. I have always wanted to see the whole thing. Well you would not believe but down under they have just release a 2 disc bonus 60 minutes extended version. It looks like it is the two films that was release in Scandinavia as each disc as a distinct movie on them that follow on from each other. It was great to watch these two movies and see the whole story. If and when this set is release in you zone or you have a multi zone player Get It as it is a good story well told.
3,Good for what it is........,"Sure, there are better movies out there on this subject, but for this releasei found the acting, the action and everything else worthy of a view.And because of what the main character did,,, he brought sweeden peace for years.Good, and ill watch it again."
4,Three's a charm,"My three year old daughter was over the moon when she unwrapped her Panda family Zoo.The toy is typical playmobil quality (good) and classic habitat construction, simple in this case.The larger/parental figures articulate well and can be nicely manipulated by my little girl. She enjoys placing them in realistic poses high in the included trees. The baby panda is quite small and that is the only negative that bears mentioning. That and the fact that the trees are standard playmobil and not some realistic bamboo forest that would've been more accurate zoologically, and therefore more educationally beneficial. Enjoy, and play along with your child whenever possible."
4,Price Gouger!!!!!,Great toy but it's always a shame to see a company so outrageously jack up the prices on a discontinued yet very popular toy.
5,A great quick reference in Anesthesiology,"This a great quick review, suitable for medical students interested in Anesthesiology, as well as Residents and House-officers. It offers clear, concise information and guidlines in an easy to use format. It will be most helpful for those in need of a quick reference of anesthesia protocols and procedures. It is not detailed enough to serve as a primary text, but is more than adequate for a quick review, or as a pocket refernce. I have found it to be the best pocket reference currently available and recommend it strongly. Its only weakness is that the section on pediatric Anesthesia could use an update, but it is valuable none the less."
1,Does anyone know the inside dimensions of this case?,Does anyone know the inside dimensions of the Kensington Deluxe Notebook Traveler?
2,Too short.,This video was too short and it lacked Israeli content. The clips seem dated and pieced poorly. Never the less I'm still buying the whole series.
3,Good for older computer.,"I'm using it in conjunction with an ATI Radeon HD4350 for a lighter gaming experience. Plays decently with 2.5gb of ram, and the videos aren't too bad either. More for work than play though. Celeron D's are just cheaper P4s, but I'd prefer a P4 over this any day."
4,Scalp Massager,This massager makes your scalp feel great... Feels like someone washing you hair... that kind of tingling... I definitely recommend this.
4,Headache Helper,"I purchsed this to massage my scalp when I have a headache. ANYONE WITH FIBROMYALGIA SHOULD BUY THIS IF THEY GET HEADACHES, Other than Migrains.It helps relax the muscles of the scalp, especially in the lower hairline,that is hard to reach with other pain relieving devices(IE-TENS UNIT).JBH"
1,Ineffective massager,"Great idea, but doesn't perform. The fingers touch a small portion of head instead of whole head and it's difficult to move around and easy to get poked in the eyes/ears. Now it just sits in a corner now as a dust collector. A nice hairbrush would be more effective and easier to use."
5,came quick and feels great,Product came quick and it feels wonderful! Who knew the head could feels so great with such little effort
4,Faaaaantastic!,For something so cheap it sure brings a lot of smiles! Anytime my boyfriend or I use it we're stopped in our tracks. Great buy!
1,Not so good :(,"My husband wanted one of these for Christmas so I ordered one for him. I have had a demo done in the mall a while back and it was much nicer than this one. The tips aren't round and smooth, they are kind of flat which scratches the head more than anything. It hasn't been used again."
2,"buy the original tingler, this is an imitation one","A friend of mine had a tingler, I thought they would be all the same. This works okay but it's not as good the original tingler. I think the prongs are too long it doesn't give you the chills like the other tingler."
1,The ends were rough and scratchy,"I tried one of these contraptions in Argentina and it was fabulous---didn't buy it there but thought I would buy one now. The massage balls on the ends were rough and scratchy, not comfortable, it felt like it was pulling your hair and tearing at your scalp. Save your money!"
