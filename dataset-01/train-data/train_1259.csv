1,Hello!?,"A very bias movie favoring Al Jazeera, a known supporter of terrorism. It is a shame that we have to commit so many good soldiers, Airmen, Sailors and Marines to defend other nations from their own criminals. What a waste of Great Americans. God Bless America! And then to waste time watching this!"
1,"name of this movie should have been named GEE"" ZEERA",when i bought movie thought i would see more than one arab biased anti american news media.......
2,watch and learn,"I recommend you watch Control Room so that you can be aware of of how manipulative the media can be (when it makes documatries like these). It is as biased as Al Jazeera itself35% sensationalist45% Lies or mistruths9% Truth11% Somebody with an English accent boring the cameraman.to be fair, there is a tiny bit of truth buried under the crap, lies, and sensationalist propaganda. It reminds us of how big of a cultural issue Iraqi Freedom is, and shows some of the weak points in US cultural awareness.If you have to watch some ultra leftist propaganda, this one is at least more educational than anything Michael Moore ever put out. It shows what al jazeera is about, and embodies their bias while pretending to be a cross between National Geographic and Fast Food Nation."
3,A very good documentary,"Most of the negative reviews seem to be about Al Jazeera itself, not this documentary. However you may feel about the news network, this documentary is an excellent peek behind the scenes."
3,Iraq War: The Propaganda Circle,"Samir Khader offers a provacative and exceptionally insightful interpretation of Al Jazeera's journalist's perspective of the Iraq War. The film is an historical documentary that fills in many of the ""blanks"" that exist with coverage of the Iraq war from pro-American government propaganda ""consumer rates driven"" media bias. Near the end of the film Khader reminds viewers that ""History tells us that human beings have short memories. History is written by the victors. People like victory, they don't like justifications."""
3,Nothing new here...,"I watched this DVD last night and had high expectations. I thought it would be very interesting to see these two news organizations critically examined. In this, I wasn't at all disappointed however, the information presented was really just a summary of all the things that everyone already knows and questions. I found my attention wandering about halfway through!That said, there were little interesting tidbits, such as when participants in the documentary take specific stories and analyze them for accuracy, propaganda, etc. But overall, I did not think the movie presented anything new or thought-provoking."
4,I'm really amazed,I've read 6 or 7 of the latest reviews by customers. I'm actually amazed that they thought they could comment on Al Jazeera based on what they saw in this film. I thought the film was quite interesting but we barely see ANY footage of that network's actual programming! The only thing we do see is the interview with an American extremist over the telephone. And the anchor CRITICIZES the guy who lined up the interview since it was a ridiculous waste of airtime.I recommend this dvd. But for the humanizing of the Al Jazeera employees and the Centcom spokesman. NOT for the experience of seeing the programming of Al Jazeera. If you want to get a sense of that and don't speak Arabic check out their web-site. Then tell me you think they are good journalists or not. CNN does a much better job of unbiased reporting than Jazeera. And FOX? Well it's probably the Western equivalent!
2,overrated,"This book has some nice tips, but is overpriced and does not have enough real world examples for my taste."
5,Beautiful,"I like to rate movies myself to help my friends and family. I have seen alot of movies and out of all 400+ movies I have seen I have given only two movies five stars and this is one of them. lets start out with the music the music is one of the best sountracks I have ever heard. It is in the same class as Tianic and Lord of the rings. The only way I can describe the violin music in this movie is magnificent. The Story is Wonderful one of friendship, love, and the durability of both of them; even through war. as the two friends build a plane to reach an tower out in the distance. I will admit if you are not careful you might get confused by the movies plot seeing that it has to deal a little bit with paralelle universes it is better than it sounds. This is one of those movies that once you see it you'll wish that you had seen it earlier. It does not matter if you like anime or not this is one movie you should see."
2,The Place Promised...but not fulfilled.,"The movie had great artwork and a score that can only be described as awesome, but these were muddied by the fact that the storyline was obscure and uninteresting. As a love story it failed in establishing a repoir between its main characters and as a story of war it failed in providing action scenes. As a scifi movie it left you wondering if maybe the science was left out in favor of the fiction. I give it two stars. One for the art, one for the music."
4,"Good, but not the best...","Being a HUGE Studio Ghibli fan I found this film recommended and decided to give it a try. It's a beautiful animation! The details are gorgeous. Visually speaking this movie is a 5 star. I took 1 star away though for the storyline itself. It is choppy and confusing and leaves the viewer questioning what it's all about really. You get the jest, but it could have been done better. Definitly watch for it's beauty, but don't expect a lot from the storyline itself."
3,"Art was beautiful, but I just couldn't take the story...","*This is Johanna Rosen's daughter, mind you*I was incredibly eager to see this movie after seeing art for it everywhere, including Newtype USA. I will admit that the art for this movie is gorgeous, but the story was... for certain tastes only. It was partly confusing, boring (I literally cried, it was so bad), and I struggled to finish the picture. It really depends on your taste as to whether you enjoy the story. If you have the opportunity, there is an extended trailer included in the extras- check that out, it's basically the entire movie in less that five minutes. The voice acting was also very well done for both Japanese and English versions of the film.3 stars- because the art is worth it."
3,The story ruins it,"Beautiful artwork in this movie. Every frame is a masterpiece. But I just couldn't get past the story. It bored me to tears. I tried, oh how I tried, but I had to turn it off at around the halfway point."
2,Saccharin Introverted Pubescent Drivel with Pictures,"OK lets list some anime conventions; insipid male leads with about as much personality as a bowl of rice, all the female characters are snivelling drips, banal supporting cast, glorious childhood memories, some promise or other that needs fulfilment and dialogue that would make a Furby wince etc etc. Behold ""The Place Promised in our Early Days"" delivering each in spades. The animation is very well done but is ""over done"" with every scene seeped in sepias, moonlight etc which I found soon got tiresome. The sci-fi plot is a strange mix of quantum mechanical dream state mumbo jumbo and parallel universes; which while rather silly (sorry all you parapsychologists) is at least quasi-interesting. The musak is dreadful fluffy garbage. I think this would have made a good silent animated short. If you want to watch a five star anime rent ""Night on the Galactic Railroad""."
4,A different world...,"Japan has been divided into two after World War Two. On the Union side is a strange tower that seems to cross or reach across the barriers of the worlds. Three children start out with dreams of exploring it and as they grow old, grow up, it seems that even while they go off course everything they do will bring them back to the tower. With one in a coma and a new world war about to start they must trigger a change that may save them and their world. Or smash it to pieces. All based on one promise made earlier in their relationship.Characters and artwork was great, but pacing needs a lot of help. A solid, emotional, story of friendship, trust and love."
3,New world kosher vs. old world kosher,"An interesting view point, if not tragically flawed. The author attempts to apply ancient jewish dietary regulations to the current monotheistic religion, that is referred to as Christianity. This doesn't work for Jack. Jack finds the work boring, and after reading, has an intense craving for bacon."
2,Initial Seal Wax Stamp,Very disappointed in this. I sent for the letter L. The loops of the letter are so tiny and I kept moving it around to see if I had it right side up. It was intended as a gift but I went out and bought a different one. The size of the whole item was good and I liked the wood handle.
1,Don't waste your money! HORRIBLE....,"Well, ain't nothing like the original soundtrack with Nell, Ken, Andre, Armelia and Charlaine!No soul, no ""pop"", no snap!"
2,Cheap grommets,"""Rustproof grommets"" means plastic. The manufacturer's description says ""Solid Brass Grommets every 18-Inch Around Hem and at Every Corner"". Not true. They are plastic and the spacing is not 18 inches. They are randomly spaced, varying from 20"" to 32"". These grommets are not secured well and can easily be pulled out. Some are not completely within the hem, so these can be pulled out with your fingers because the bottom of the grommet is in the thicker hem while the upper part is in the single layer fabric. The corner grommets are very good. I got 10 years out of my previous tarp with brass grommets, used as a boat cover on an ""A"" frame. I'll be lucky to get 2 years out of this one."
5,Vegan Natural Choice,"Vegan. Natural. From Norway. Savory thin crispbread. Very mild chili flavor with a more prominent garlic flavor note. Two airtight packages per box. Wafers are the size of half of the front of the package standing upwards, comparable to a graham cracker. 20 Kcal per wafer. Low fat. About half the thickness of a saltine, but stronger. Very enjoyable with chili or soup or for savory appetizers. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews for more great choices. Check out ""Vegan Grocery Favorites"" and ""Vegan Grocery Top Ten"" in Listmania. Your ""helpful"" votes count and will be greatly appreciated to benefit the search of others. Thank you."
2,Sitting in the Warehouse?,"I like these crackers, and the price is right through Amazon. I am really dissatisfied with the fact that I received 12 boxes of these crackers in early February, and they have an expiration date in April. When I've bought them in the store, the expiration date is at least a year off."
3,"And yet another ""End of the World"" movie.","Ever get the feeling that someone just makes movies like this to break our sanity? Then again, did you ever get the feeling your child was a spawn of pure evil? A wealthy business man learns the hard way his own son is the Anti-Christ who plans to rule to world. Grim from start to finish, don't expect a happy ending in this dark tale of murder, sex and power gone completely mad."
2,"Not necessarily the best chords, or the easiest","I give it two stars for being affordable, and for the fact that some of the chord formations are indeed the correct basic patterns. But several of the suggested chords are pointlessly hard to play, and don't really sound all that good anyway. The overarching problem with this book is that it only encourages players to use chord formations involving a range of, usually, three frets, as opposed to the first seven--which is actually easier, and results in much fuller and cleaner sounding chords. For that matter, bar chords on the mandolin are never going to sound as clear as open chords, but you'd never know it from looking at this resource. It may not be a total washout, but buyer, beware. A rare misstep from the Mel Bay catalogue."
5,A Great Read!,"While this book was quick and easy, it supplied me with many laughs and an enjoyable read. Alice is a hilarious protagonist, along with other funny characters like Lester, Aunt Sal and Patrick. Once again, I was greatly impressed with Naylor's fine work."
5,Alice all grown up!!,"This is a really good book if you are 12 , 13 or 11.. bucause it talks about grownig up.Alice gets a physical and she is worried about what is going to happen when she is there. read this book it is good!!!by: sassy12"
4,Excellent Jungian Interpretation,"This is one of the finest examples of Jungian interpretation of the Bible. It combines contemporary Biblical criticism with profound psychological interpretation. Father and daughter analysts contribute two essays: Yehezikel Kluger's gives the book its title and Nomi Kluger-Nash writes from a more personal perspective about the figure of Naomi. Jungian interpretations are often wildly ahistorical, but the authors are familiar with a wide range of Biblical scholarship and can deal with the text in the original Hebrew. Their only fault is to retain too much of the outdated theories about pre-Biblical matriarchy, characteristic of Jungian works."
3,"Not their best, but still good.","I admit, of their first five albums, this is probably the weakest. But, their weakest is another bands best, right? The hit from this was ""Someday?"", but the title track and ""Ghost Of A Texas Ladies' Man"" are pretty strong too. I also like ""A Long Time Ago"" and ""I Wanna Be Your Friend Again"", and ""Coeurs Jumeaux"" is a beautiful song done in French. Plus it ends with a ""James Brown"" cover. So, although this might not be the best pick for newcomers, it's essential to the fanatic, and overall pretty good."
3,Good album,Very good album. Glad I got it. I've always wanted this album. It came with two ticket stubs from past concerts.
3,Not a Bad Effort here by Janette and Co. + Tom Petersson for Cheap Trick in a good video,"I was A BIT LEARY of this relaese after what TomPetersson was forced to by his ex- in the horrific""Tom Petersson and Another Language"" (sold exactly323 copies of the 10,000 pressed - vinyl only, in'84), but I like it better that C.B.'s last one.By the way, Trick fans - Tom still lives in L.A.,the home of my beloved L.A. Clippers! Good Efforthere. Tom did well on the Bass here - then why'dhe do so mediocorely on Woke Up With A Monster?"
2,Disappointing purchase,The handle broke off on my husband's first overseas trip. The quality of this bag is below my expectations.
5,Nut review,"It was easy to order the product. The product was a reasonable cost. It was delivered in a timely basis, and the product was correct - the first time."
1,GREEDY! GRDDY! GREEDY!,Regardless of how good is the second season I refuse to buy split seasons into volumes! We sould all show the network how unhappy we are from this greedy decision despite of the the fact that the second season was very good.
2,Something weird is here.,"Like the others said, he sang very ""cold"" ,not meaning to me, not emotion.Besides his voice ,I didn't liked it.I own the Heavely voices DVD,and this guy doesn't transmite that ""Magic"" in the stage..But,the music is great."
1,truly terrible,"A tedious, tiresome, terrible book. Mallory is completely unlikeable and I just couldn't find a reason to care less about her. She does not elicit interest, empathy or sympathy. Where did her interest in oliver tree and the WWII murder come from anyway??? The story was bogged by technical details about magic tricks. At one point I found myself wishing that there were explanatory illustrations so I could figure out what was supposed to be happening. The magicians were equally as tedious. By the end I couldn't care less who had killed whom for what reason. My only goal was to just get the thing finished and shelved in a dark, forgotten corner where it belongs."
2,Dissapointed,"I was disappointed in this book. It was like an earlier novel rather than a continuation. Carol O'connell is my one of my favorite authors, but this book was hard to finish. I'm looking forward to more, though."
5,Great,Another great Mallory book. Thank you. I have enjoyed every one of them and pass them on to a special friend who has the same taste in books.
4,Knowing When to Leave,"I haven't read Shell Game (just giving it 4 stars so as not to skew the average rating; about 4.5 right now). But I have read all the other Mallory books. At the end of Stone Angel, I was convinced (no, I KNEW) that the series was complete. The narrative arc of Mallory's personal mystery which O'Connell had carefully constructed and which spanned the books, had come to rest. I was devastated at the thought that there would be no more Mallaries but entirely satisfied at the resolution.Sometimes authors should know when to leave."
2,A book I found hard to pick up,"I've read all of the Carol O'Connell books featuring Mallory, etc. Having always had an interest in magic, I thought this would be a great read. ""Tedious"" is the word many other reviewers have used and I agree. I really lost interest in how and why Louisa had been killed 60 years before and which of the magicians were guilty then and now for the present murder(s). Thank goodness it was not the first O'Connell book I have read. Not up to the standard of those great books that preceded it."
2,I only finished it because I had nothing else to read!,"This book really deserves only 1 star but out of respect for the truly wonderful series that suffers a letdown with this book, I give it 2. Doesn't the NYPD have anything better to do with what are purported to be two of its best officers? Did Mallory get a message from outer space nudging her to investigate a World War II death? Like other readers I expected a Mallory who was at least slightly affected by the action in the previous book. But no, she is the same amoral machine we previously encountered. Her supporters have become her apologists and even they are beginning to have doublt about her. Is there a direction to this series or just a series of non connected police stories? Instead of wasting a book on this slight story, why not a short, short story--that's all the plot content allows. I will hope for better from the next Mallory."
5,"""O'Connell Rates 5 Stars Again""","""Shell Game"" may not be quite up to the standards of ""Stone Angel,"" but any Carol O'Connell book is better that almost any other author's. Mallory returns to the NYPD to solve the perplexing murder of an elderly magician, and back with her are her cohorts in crime--Charles and Riker. Great entertaiment!"
3,Disappointed,"I am disappointed in The Shell Game. I feel it is too slow, wordy and going over same dialogue with all characters; it's got so I don't care about any of the people. It is a chore to read. I liked all of the other book about Malory, but this one is a chore to finish; IF I do."
2,Not as good as I expected,"I really like this series and was disappointed in this book. The mystery never captured my interest in the way that her other books have. If I were not interested in the characters, I may have put the book down."
1,Disappointment,"I have read all the previous Mallory books and found this one to be very disappointing. Too much unnecessary (and boring) detail about magic props and equipment and not enough attention to the story itself. At several points, interesting activities were abruptly cut off and there was no follow-up later to tell the reader what happened. This was a very slow-moving, plodding book. Not at all what I have come to expect from this author and definitely not up to the quality and interest of the previous books. It was a struggle to wade through it to the finish."
1,Not worth it,"I bought this to use after I had my daughter. I had a rough labor and recovery so I wanted to take it easy. But this was to easy. I was bored and not at all ""worked out"". I never broke a sweat or drew a labored breath. Instead I started using the power 90 dvds. Perhaps the DVD was meant for new moms who weren't working otu prior to baby arriving."
4,it is great for new moms...,"this dvd was great. at first i was iffy... she was repetitive on the ""what to do with baby"" instructions, but if you look beyond this it's a great video. I thought the exercises looked extremely easy, until i did them. i did the dvd yesterday, and i'm sore today. a good feeling! i'm looking forward to doing her total fitness also."
1,Do not buy,I bought this video so I could work out with my 2 month old baby and was very disappointed. The instructor uses a ball and not an infant to do the exercises and it doesn't really work with an infant. It wasn't very challenging of a work out either.
3,"great, but a bit lacking","Though it's a nice workout to do with your baby, JNL doesn't show you how to hold your baby. It would've been helpful if she included a baby for part of her routine so you can see how to hold your own baby while doing the workout.On the plus side, I do the workout when my baby girl is fussy and she's usually asleep half way thru the workout. :) I really gott thank JNL for that. :)"
4,A book from my childhood.,"I have a copy of this book from Scholastic Press dated 1963. I remember reading it and rereading it as a child. Each time I read it I understood more of the sacrifice it took for Hannah and Jethro to give up their comfortable home in England for the uncertainty of America. The plums did indeed hang high for this couple. They endured homelessness, poverty, hunger and the death of a child in their quest to live the American dream. Read this book and experience the lives of people who could have been our immigrant ancestors."
4,Warner's,"One of the few bras you can get that are still padding free, underwire, front fasten. The closures are sturdy and hold up well. They don't come un-fastened like other types of front fasten closures."
1,Not pleased,I ordered one (1) Warner's Bra 1218-BLK-36C and received two (2). I only wanted one (1) - was this taken off the total Amazon Gift Certificate???Kindly advise the balance on the gift certificate.
5,Warner Bra,"I have worn this bra for over 25 years, I can no longer find it in the stores. When searching for it online I never thought I would find it on amazon. I purchased 3 bras, and I will continue buying them as long as I can find them. I love the front closure, the underwire and the look and feel of the bra."
1,NO SUPPORT!!,I SPENT 500.00 ON THIS GREAT NAILER ONLY TO FIND OUT YOU CAN'T GET ANY NAILS FOR IT ANYWHERE. NOT EVEN FROM HITACHI!!!!!!!!!! WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?? AMAZON IS STILL CURRENTLY SELLING THEM YET THEY DON'T HAVE A CLUE AS TO WHERE TO GET ANY NAILS FOR IT. I GUESS I'LL JUST USE IT AS A HAMMER AND BEAT THE NAILS IN
3,"Good tool, some misunderstanding about nails","This tool is as good as any other Bostich... which is pretty good, especially at the very reasonable prices they go for used. The issue raised about the nails relates to the 21 degree angle of the magazine; almost every other manufacturer - and other Bostich models - use a 16 degree slant. If you have a reliable supplier of nail coils, go for it. If not, or if you plan to be on the road a lot and hunting supplies in strange places, getting something a bit easier to feed might be smart."
3,I had problems with this one...,"Well, much like many of the other reviewers, I had read Katherine and was very excited when this one came in the mail. I was disappointed, however, in the last third or so of the book. The first two-thirds were promising, containing much of what I love about historical fiction, but after that, I seriously wanted to give up. The characters were getting flatter and flatter and the story line itself 'jumped the shark' - so to speak. Save your money..."
5,Awesome story!,"This is an excellent book: a historical novel, well-researched, of an unusual time period. The characters are based on real people, and the story is compelling. It might appear to be a cheap paperback, but ignore that; novels often have deep truths hidden in them. I thought about this book a lot after I read it."
4,Do not flash your headlights in San Jose!,"I frequently receive urgent warnings from from friends and colleagues via e-mail. They always provide me with crucial information, e.g. do not use your cell phone near a gas pump (the pump will explode); do not open certain e-mail messages (your drive will be wiped); and of course - do not flash your headlights in San Jose (you will be murdered to facilitate a gang initiation). Thanks to the works of Brunvand, I amaze and mystify my friends by my ability to recognize these electronic urban legends. This book carries on the urban legend tradition of the author's other works: ""The Mexican Pet"", ""Curses! Broiled Again"", for example . I recommend this new book without reservation. You too can become an urban legend spotter."
5,A Beautiful Book,"If a Dolphin Were a Fish is an enchanting book about a dolphin who imagines what it would be like to be other creatures. The artwork is beautiful, and the imaginative way that other animals' features are incorporated into Delphina's body is creative and delightful.Art teachers, elementary classroom teachers, and others who work with children will find this an excellent resource. Comparing and contrasting the various animals' features and habitats, predicting which choice Delphina will make next, deciding whether she'll eventually be happy with her own status...are just a few of the thinking/discussion topics that this book presents. I love this book, and recommend it highly for children of all ages!"
4,Delightful!,"A dolphin named Delfina wonders how life would be if she were another different animal. This story teaches about dolphins by explaining why Delfina can't be a turtle, a bird, or many other animals, while giving simple information about each animal.Certain fun for children and a solid tool for teachers with extra information and teaching aids in the back.I love the colored pencil illustrations in this book, my favorite being Delfina as a turtle. Envision a small dolphin with a turtle shell and spots.Writer and illustrator both work for Sea World Orlando in the Education Department. The book has dual lessons: One deals with the science of dolphins and the comparison animals. Hopefully children will also learn that by design, we are best at being ourselves.Armchair Interview says this book is, ""In a word: delightful."""
5,If A Dolphin Were a Fish,"This delightful book thrilled my neighbor's daughter,Kira. I bought it as a birthday gift, but it's such a great book, I had to give it to her now.The story is adorable and the illustrations are beautiful. Kira doesn't notice this, but the thing I like about the book is the educational value. The reader is learning while enjoying the story, as Delfina imagines herself as other sea creatures and how her body would be different.Not only are the illustrations beautiful, but they are funny as well. The way the dolphin's form is combined with other sea creatures is hilarious and surprisingly, graceful. You'll need to check out the sea turtle w/the dolphin head to see how that's possible!Overall, this book is jampacked w/education and entertainment and I highly reccomend it for the children in your life as well as your inner child."
2,Met my wife( she was wearing this shirt),"Unfortunately, this shirt can be a little misleading. I was in a club with a couple of pals and saw a gorgeous woman out on the floor doing the Macarena. Instinctively, I sprinklered my way over to her and gave her that look of, ""I know"". She received my advances very well, and we left holding hands. I thought I was the luckiest guy in the world, so I asked her to marry me. We got married in the forest, and released a cadre of swallows to signify our union.Our wedding night, which was set to be the best night of my night, turned out to be a huge disappointment. I wanted her to keep the swallows t-shirt on, to show our love of swallows, and that was when she dropped the bomb... she doesn't like swallows. I was horrified to realize that I had just made the biggest mistake of my life by marrying a woman who hated my beloved birds.I give this shirt a 2/5 because I'm now in a horrible divorce."
5,The BEST Survivor to date.,"I had missed the first season of Survivor, but decided to catch the second game to see what all the hype was about. I was pleasantly surprised and instantly got hooked on the show! From bad girl Jerri to hunk Colby to catty Jeff to the hilarious Mad Dog, this show was the best!Unfortunately it was followed by horrible game set in Africa and it was all downhill from there."
3,Just don't look at the cover...,"This was an enjoyable season. However if i am reviewing this product then there is something i should mention...I bought this season on DVD because I had not watched it when it was on TV. I didn't know who the winner was. Unfortunatly, the front cover of each case has pictures of the people voted out in those episodes! And even if you manage to not look at the cover, the menus on the DVDs themselves all show who is voted off in each episode. This DVD set is impossible to watch without being spoiled. It's enough to make you wish you'd downloaded them illegally instead. Good job CBS!"
4,slow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THis package took forever it takes over the range in days it tells you but is a really really good season overall!!!!!!!!!!
1,"Loads of Stories, lack of content","EVA, the ... creating wealth starts of in a nice pace laying some of the ground work to why companies should move to an EVA view on their business performance. However, after a chapter or so one might expect that the book shifts its focus to showing how to implement EVA in a real life organization. It is especially in this area that the books seriously lacks content. The numbers of all the SternStewart clients look great but not a single ""How-to-EVA"" step can be found in the book. The book stops after the sales pitch and expects the reader to contact SternStewart to take it from there. It is for this reason that I do not feel any economic value added from this book, and do not recommend others to lock up any capital or effort into this book.Bottom line: nice concept, no content"
1,Buying this book is buying a sales brochure.,"I purchased this book hoping to understand EVA and how to apply it to my stock investments. This book is nothing more than a sales brochure for Stern Stewart. It has some examples of some companies that have prospered using EVA. However, it doesn't tell you how to calculate EVA or how to apply it to your business model. It is a redundant book that continuously says ""EVA is better than GAAP earnings, look at what happened at this company."" I strongly suggest you pass and apply your money elsewhere if you want to understand EVA."
4,Great Book for Deciding to Go Further,"Ehrbar's book is criticized properly as a ""sales brochure"", but it also came in handy as a primer to the subject of EVA and as a tool to decide whether or not to tackle G. Bennet Stewart's tome ""The Quest for Value"". This book will either get you hooked on the concept, or will push you away. If you get hooked, Stewart's book rounds out the knowledge to implement. I believe that they have found the measurement that correlates the value of the business -- classically found through good cash flow analysis -- with management performance. EVA defines success if used properly."
2,Glossy sales brochure - not a useful book!,"This book is an excellent testament to Stern Stewart and EVA. It sings loudly the praises of EVA and the wonderful accomplishments of Stern Stewart. Coincidentally it suggests that Stern Stewart are available for consultancy!The principle of EVA appears sound, but this book is poor at attempting to illustrate how to practically use it. It is also very biased towards EVA and dead-set against all other tools."
1,reviewers pls be more truthful,"how could someone give it a five stars rating when in fact there is nothing in this book that really tell you much about eva except the fact that it improves company performance, not the how and why,"
3,Gold Toe anklets,The Gold toe anklets are adequate. I did not find them to be as nice to wear as the previous Gold Toe anklets that I have had. They are not as soft and warm feeling.
3,one problem,the plastic tie that you put in to attach the three pairs of stockings leaves a hole. I have to throw away a number of socks to get enough good ones.
3,Acceptable,"The fabric is quite thin. But I tend to be very gentle with my socks. So I probably won't have issues with holes. Also the elastic isn't stretchy enough. When I pull them on the top feels tight and thin without enough stretch, which I find annoying. So I'm concerned that I might break some of the stitching and then have them fall down. But there is a nice amount of room in the toe area, which is reinforced. And they look nice. So they are decent for the price, but I don't plan to buy more."
2,Reading a script = LAME,"The lecturer fails miserably at keeping the listener's attention. I can't believe the people at West who produce Sum & Substance did not provide guidance like ""Rule 1: DO NOT READ A SCRIPT."" If a Sum & Substance CD set is available for a class I am taking, I buy it. I've purchased all the 1L CDs and more. The lecturer occasionally misreads typos in his own script. Awful! LAME! If you buy these, just know that you are going to be listening to a robot recite a very exhaustive IP outline. You will have to work to learn from these CDs. This compilation is a D+/C- compared to the other works like the contract, crim-law, and Constitutional law CDs which are all very good."
5,Outstanding,"I am totally satisfied with the promptness of the service, and the quality thereof as well. I look forward to doing business with you again in the not too distant future. Thanks for all."
4,Excellent guide,"Though a little more focused on rituals rather than stories (compared with what I would appreciate), ""Praying With Celtic Holy Women"" is a most effective outline of the role these women played within early Irish Christianity.The book gives a good, if not detailed, outline of the lives of about eighteen women saints from the fifth, sixth and seventh centuries, showing how they rose to the status they did, and what they taught very effectively. We see very clearly what kind of spiritual life these women lived and the values they considered important, as well as some interesting prayers for these women (the authors are nuns).The introductory part of the book is rather repetitive but nonetheless does fit the purpose of the work, showing how pre-Christian Celtic society gave women a status they have rarely obtained in the history of civilised society.Because it contains some hard-to-find information, this is a worthy resource even if not all of it is new."
5,Good Research,"This book was very well researched. There is nothing worse than getting to the end of a book with a lot of information in it only to find that there is nothing backing that information up. This book was a very interesting read, it talked of the Civil War politics in a more interesting way than most books."
2,old news,"this book wasn't that good.. in fact it isn't just good.the topic has been covered before and, to me, it was like i was reading those portions again only drawn out. there was nothing new to the story or even the way the author told it. i regret having bought the book and not sure i would recommend it even for someone to check out, free, at a library."
4,A Good Piece of Textbook,"This book is a very good textbook which outlines all essentials and principles of transport planning and policy, with examples and illustration. There is one minor de-merit which the book is too concentrate on United Kingdom situation. However, I would still say that this book is very useful for students who need to understand the transportation and traffice engineering principles."
4,"Beautiful photography, I didn't want it to end!","If you love travel, get this DVD. The photography and computer graphics/simulations are fabulous. With its emphasis on the archaeology of Santorini and Athens, the only reason for not giving this DVD 5 stars is that it doesn't show enough of Greece. The video is over waaaay too soon. I wanted it to go on for another hour or two. Also, the music is beautiful and really makes you feel you are there."
3,Beautiful but disappointing,"If you just want visual impressions, the typical IMAX excellence in photography will be pleasing. But the ""secrets of the past"" aspect jumps around in time and never really tells a coherent story."
2,NOT WMVHD,"Bought this DVD on the basis that it was a High Definition DVD using Microsoft's WMVHD technology i.e like the other IMAX titles such as Amazon, The Living Sea etc. Those titles ship with two disks - one standard, and one PC only (high definition) version. This Greece title is just a single, standard definition DVD. Nothing special. This lower quality title costs the same as the higher quality IMAX titles. Be v. careful of what you are buying. If you receive two disks, then you're ok...."
4,Great product! Very interesting!,Very informative. Great scenes. Learned alot of Greek History. Loved it!!!
3,A little disappointing,"I have to agree with the reviewers who found this DVD to be somewhat limiting.There are some great CGI reconstructions of the Parthenon as it existed in ancient times. However, except for that, much of this DVD focuses on modern Greece. Much of it is little more than a travelogue.The photography is beautiful, but, there was little footage of the ancient Greek structures for which most people seek out documentaries on Greece.In all, I would not again pay the price for this DVD. It's worth watching if you can view it on a one-time basis, economically, through rental.Greece: Secrets of the Past (IMAX)"
2,pretty but shallow,"The cinematography is beautiful and the sound track is pretty. The film for me, however, did not provide enough material to make it worth paying to rent. I guess I should not have expected a lot from a video this short but I had opened to see more of the Bronze Age. The narrative also provided little in the way of depth to the subject. I cannot recommend this video."
1,There are better works out there,"As the editorial reviews point out, this work falls short on solutions and those offered can be cataloged as 'naive.' Still, it IS a work of photojournalism, so its purpose is mostly limited to that of bearing witness. As the author of two guidebooks on Guatemala, I was contacted by the author requesting that I include this work in the list of suggested reading at the end of my books. Given that it's out of print in the U.S. and I think there are better options for understanding Guatemala's human rights tragedies, I have to refrain from recommending it. Also, I take issue with people who write the only one-star review of your product (it averages 4 stars)Moon Guatemala (Moon Handbooks)while simultaneously asking you to endorse theirs."
4,Great Play,"I am not a huge fan of Neil Simon. In general, I find his work to be a bit obvious and overblown, however ""Lost in Yonkers"" was a major exception. This is a funny, sad, smart, interesting and ultimately satisfying play.The characters are very nuanced and the dialogue is consistently sharp. I would love to see a production of this play as I'm sure it's even better live on the stage."
2,Fine if you like Neil Simon,"Start with a colorful group of Jewish characters, add a desperate financial situation, throw in some unfullfilled dreams and a couple old resentments, and wackiness ensues...The play has some laughs, but most are at the expense of the humanity of the characters. The action seems to be driven more by Simon's attempt to make the characters ""colorful"" rather than to pursue deeper meaning. For example, Aunt Gert's overly-contrived speech impediment, introduced early for a cheap laugh, grows tiresome when she has extended lines in the second half. She is not a person -- she's ""neurotic character B.""I listened to the play on CD. Perhaps the director felt that forced accents and overacting were necessary for an audio recording, but I found the lack of subtlety grating. If you don't already like other work by Neil Simon, I don't think this will change your mind."
3,misunderstood,I thought this book was dumb. It never had a plot or a big punc to it. I needed there to be some more action to it.
4,A now under-appreciated band from a time full of them.,"The Buzzcocks are still waiting for their recognition. With their newest CD, Modern released just last year, pete shelley, and co. really want to entertain you. And this CD will do just that. If you are into bands like the Jam and the Damned, you'll appreciate this CD. Its a culmination of their works from the height of punk, with songs to grab you, and make you listen throughout. The only problem is, sometimes, its just too much of a good thing, and the songs start to sound the same. Songs like the first two tracks, which were also their first two singles, orgasm addict, and what do i get are super, and there are more songs with that intensity on the album, but with 25 tracks on the album, its almost too much of a good thing. A worthy buy if youre into late 70s punk, you should already own it if you've been a fan."
2,Ever Heard of Sound Quality,"I am by no means a hardcore audiophile who complains of sound quality all the time. I picked this album up without reading reviews because I thought it would be a no-brainer. It had a ton of the songs I loved and some new ones I hadn't heard. Yet, when I popped it into my player, what came out was not the music I remembered. I felt like I was listening to the Buzzcocks play inside a tin shed wrapped in cardboard. Not sure which album you should buy if you love the Buzzcocks, but I am giving mine away and looking for a new one."
2,NOT TO GREAT,"I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY WERE ""POWER POP"". NOT THE CASE AT ALL. OUT OF 25 TRACKS ABOUT 3 OF THEM ARE DESCENT AND THE REST ARE JUST GARBAGE. CRAPPY DOLLAR STORE SOUND, STUPID IMMATURE LYRICS, AND SOME OF THE MOST DRAWN OUT AVERAGE SOUNDING GENERIC GUITAR RIFFS MAKE UP THIS ALBUM, WHICH PROVES THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE 25 TRACKS AND 80 MINUTES OF MUSIC DOSENT MEAN YOU HAVE A HIT . I DID HOWEVER ENJOY TRACKS 9, 17 AND 23, BUT FOR 12 DOLLARS, ITS NOT WORTH IT AT ALL. RISK ARREST AND JUST DOWNLOAD THE 3 DECENT TRACKS ON KAZAA, CUZ THE REST IS GARBAGE."
3,"flawless, but way too expensive for little memory","People can make multi-gig thumb flash drives now that are available for less than the price of this thing. you can get a multi-gig hard drive for your PC for less. Since the hard drive is detachable, this thing is almost redundant. It is simply way too expensive for so little memory."
4,For all you people with a life out there...,"Ok, first off just wanted to say that this is a little over priced for the amount of memory it gives you being the reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. For all you people with a life out there and aren't spoiled and/or rich (meaning you didn't get the platinum system) this is perfect. You can save around 20+ games and still use Xbox live. If your a hard core gamer and download all that stuff from Xbox live this isn't what you want. I, myself bought the core system which comes with no memory unit and bought this to save myself some money. I have 12 games saved on the memory unit and Xbox live and still have 44MB left. (10 MB are used for formatting). All I do is play my games and play on Xbox live. THERE IS NO NEED FOR A 20 OR 120 GB MEMORY FOR THE CASUAL GAMER."
1,"There's only ONE reason to buy this. Otherwise, don't waste your money.","The only reason to buy this is if you ABSOLUTELY HAVE to transport your xBox Live account back and forth to a friend's xBox 360. ...And even then there's really no point since most online games allow you to log into your friend's xBox Live guest account for online play.If you're getting it just to save games, seriously, DON'T waste your money. For just over twice the price of this 64m card you can buy theXbox 360 20GB Hard Driveadd on. That's 2x the cost for 312x the size!! And, with the HDD you can download free content, demos, levels, etc...Total waste of money. I can't believe I ever thought I ""needed"" it."
3,"Not too bad, a little too small","The 64mb XBOX 360 memory unit was just what I needed to save my Tiger Woods 07 game so I could play over at a buddy's house without having to lug my entire 360 around. It's useful, handy, and it comes with a plastic storage case. All in all, I am pleased."
4,360 Memory Unit,"This is a good product if you need to take your live account, or other game save, to your friend's house. It is a little pricey for only being 64 megabytes, but it gets the job done."
3,surved its purpose,the only problem i had with it was when it got shocked by my hand in the winter it would not work anymore
4,Only about 50MB available,Seems like a big chunk that goes to other stuff... but does everything else as advertised. Might have waited to buy the bigger one if I'd known it was coming out in the near future (which it might).
3,It's Memory Unit - Whoopie!,"I bought so I could shuttle my Xbox Live account between different consoles. This ain't a game, why am I being asked to review it like one? Why does Microsoft make me buy a proprietary memory unit when they could make it possible to use a USB thumb drive? Only one answer; GREED."
3,Buy the Hard Drive,I have the core and had to buy the memory card but quickly bought the Hard drive as I realized I wouldnt have enough space for my games.
3,I have yet to use it,"I bought this item maily as a backup medium for some of my profiles & games on my 360, but as of date have yet to use!"
1,Spend $60 more for the 20gb harddrive!!!!!!!!!!!,"This memory card is not worth the money. If you bought the core 360, then you should just buy the harddrive. The memory card only holds gamesaves. The harddrive holds gamesaves, photos, music, and videos. Get more out of your Xbox 360 by adding games and media."
4,Great Buy!,"Never in a million years did I expect to buy a mower online, however, I am glad I did. I am very satisfied with this unit. The 20HP engine is rugged and you will spend much more for a 20HP elsewhere, believe me, I looked. Cuts and turns well. Just added gas and it was an immediate start. Shipping was 100% free and delivered within the quoted time frame and came in a wooden crate for protection. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that the unit has a low-back seat and doesn't mow in reverse. But for the price, I'm not going to complain about that. As for the Tecumseh engine vs a Briggs & Stratton, I had a push mower equipped with a 4HP Tecumseh engine that outlasted two B&S push mowers. Maybe luck, but I have had no issues in the past with Tecumseh."
3,Cheap Mower,Mower has very good engine but frame itself is very cheaply made. What a shame that they went to the expense of putting a very nice engine on it but really cut corners when it came to the body. Cutting height is easy to adjust and level but it does not come with any deck wheels so it scalps the yard quite a bit. I would not purchase this mower again. Instead would go with the Husqvarna mower of comparable size.
1,Don't expect a level cut,"I've owned this tractor for 4 years now. Each time I use it, I am reminded of just what a disappointment it is and what a crappy cut it gives. After the first year I moth- balled it and bought a 30 year old John Deere to cut my lawn. What a difference. The old Johnny finally died so I'm back to the Yard Machine and it's still the disappointment that I remembered it being. Gotta love the 20 horse engine, but the weak frame flexes so much that it's impossible to get a level cut. The only adjustment I can find is on the left front of the deck and I have it as low as possible. This severely limits deck height adjustments and it still scalps on the right side when making a left turn. Way too much frame flex. I've gone as far as placing a brick on the left side of the deck in an attempt to get a level cut...to no avail. I think this mower has been discontinued, but if you happen to come across a used one for sale.......DON'T BUY IT !!! You'll be disappointed."
1,downfall on riding lawnmowers,"The Yard Machine I bought from WalMart looked great ran great the first 2 times I cut my yard, after that it started eating the belts up the sissor clutch system would hang up against the inside frame work and you would have to kick the clutch several times to get it unhunge. the clutch system is the worst I've ever seen a defect in design from get go. but the 20 horse power tucumseh twin v engine is a perfect engine which I removed 3 months after I purchesed the mower,I'm saveing it in my shed to put on a different frame with a better clutch design, but never a yard machine again ,but a tecumseh engine I'll always count on. there tough dependable and reliable.A hydrlic clutch system would have been a perfect combo with the tecumseh engine its a shame they didnt think of that, and a pto on the rear of the lawn mower would have made it flawless to bad the designers didnt think ahead there sales would have jumped thru the roof . Yours Truly Mark Willard of Wilmer Ala."
5,"""Vassar""",I found this a really great item. People can learn alot from this outstanding fiddler!I highly recommend this item.
4,For a first-time visitor...this is a god-send.,"Even if you have never camped before, it will hold your hand for the entire experience....There's also a companion video available, useful to people who have never camped before."
4,great southern rock,"This album is better than the second one they did.I found this cd to be very good ,the other one i didnt.If you like good rock and roll ,pick this one up."
2,Very Traditional - Kinda boring,"I got this because of the colorful pictures on the cover and thought that my 3yr old would enjoy it. All the pages have almost the exact same picture on it, with a different animal in the same phrase on every page. It was ok for the first 3 pages, then I couldnt see going through the whole farm for this one. I ended up going to a different book because it was wayyyy too redundant. I know the song is, but i would expect better illustation."
1,Confused,"Being a teenager from Maine I was intrigued to discover a story that it close to all of our hearts - discovering ourselves and falling in love with the first girl that shows us the slightest bit of attention. However, imagine my horror when after the first page I discoverd that this book was nothing more than than ill thought out imature example of someone who obviosuly dreams about such things but clealry spends too much time playing the latest Sony Playstation game."
2,Not for Beginners,"I have been a Civil engineering Instructor for the past five years and have used this text also. The text is quite handy for the intermediate to advanced level of Civil Engineeering students. This text should not be used for the beginner due to it's higher level of content. If this is to be used for the introductory level, the instructor should have a copy only and use it a guide. More students in the introductory phase wash out after reading a few chapters."
2,Bedtime for Gil,"See Gil. See Gil run apple. See Gil get fired. Poor Gil.This book has some interesting observations about apple culture, and a couple lessons for tech managers, but it's also full of self-congratulatory prose, with an occasional good dollop of self-pity. It's also written at around a 4th grade level - there were lots of opportunities for deeper analysis of what happened at apple, why Gil's strategies for turning the place around might have worked or might have failed, NeXT vs Be, and how apple changed as an organization. Unfortunately, Amelio and his co-author never delve into the details."
5,The corporate equivalent of Richard Nixon's memoirs,"The most accurate description of Amelio's tenure at Apple was his own observation on page 213: ""I often think how wasteful it is that those with real capabilities should doubt their abilities, while bunglers seem so damn sure of themselves."" Since the entire saga lacks a sense of irony or any shred of introspection it will serve just fine as his epitaph. The book deserves a solid 10 as a reminder of why management gets a bad name."
2,Desperate for Approval?...No. Just Seeking extra cash,"There's little that can be said about apple that has not been said already, from a darling of the computer industry, the ""cool""computer company, the education market cornerer to abroken hearted corporation without stamina to go on.... Reading trough the lines of this book you realize how commited is the writer to selling you the idea that he was like Julius Caesar surrounded by traitors and not understood by his friends. Rather, he comes across as a uncaring, intelligent person that does not realize on time that he's dealing with human beings, that the money is not going to last forever and that there's a strong reason for adminting your mistakes and that is not to repeat them."
1,The Gilbert Principle... how not to be a CEO,Pathetic. Ameilio's business accumen can be summed up by my one take away from this book - Only he could drive the company he controls to pay hunderds of Millions of Dollars to another firm to institute a hostile take over.
5,Ready for takeoff,"Gil Amelio was the pilot of an F-16 fighter jet for National Semiconductor. The Apple board asked if he would rather fly their business plane instead. Amelio, an experienced pilot, often thought the guages didn't read correctly, but kept flying anyway. 500 days later they pulled the plug. It was only a flight simulator."
4,Apple Made a Big Mistake,"After reading this book, I came to a conclusion that Apple made a big mistake by getting rid of Amelio. The truth is, they could be a lot further along than they are, even today, had they not have made the descision to oust him from his post after only a year and a half. The book is written very well, and is a book that you can get through, and understand easily. There were not many typos that I noticed in the book. This is a must read for Apple fans, Windows fans, and businessmen alike."
2,Kind of boring,"Amelio, even after 500 days of service, did not know about Apple. I find this book not exciting, and it failed to point out Apple's real issues: market share.How funny that Steve Jobs also fails to bring Apple back. About three years after, the production of Macintosh is still a little higher or lower than 4 million units. Compare it to the world PC production of 100 million+ units, this is poor.Apple's worst days are yet to come."
3,"Great if you want to know more about Apple, Gil not a CEO","This is really interesting for anyone who wants to know more about Apple, or life inside a fast moving technology company from a slow moving author. Book does not read well, and Gil spends lots of time moaning and pontificating. Clearly the guy is no CEO and is very nieve about high technology companies, despite his record of 'turn-arounds'."
3,Interesting but...,"An interesting read but I found it fascinating that Amelio seemed to blame everybody but himself. His statements about Steve Jobs at the end collapse into pettiness, especially about Jobs driving the ""biggest, most expensive Mercedes."" Who cares, Steve has saved Apple, something Gill could not do."
2,No wonder Amelio only lasted 500 days,"Amelio shows why his reign over Apple was a failure. His technical knowledge is shown to be severely lacking with several major gaffes in terminology (megahertz vs megabits) and at the same time, insults his former engineers by saying *they* didn't get it.the book is somewhat interesting if you can get by the pompousness of Amelio."
2,Preaching without practicing,"Amelio seems to have a disconnect between his criticisms of Apple's employees and his own actions as CEO. He identifies lack of follow-through as a key problem in Apple's culture, but details numerous occasions when he gave directions (orders?) but did nothing to assure that they were carried out. He discusses his choice of a second-in-command in a very detached fashion, yet one of the key jobs of any CEO is to select and direct competent subordinates. By his own admission, his choice for COO was a disaster, yet Amelio elevated him and left him in place. For a very different approach to turn-around management, readers might want to consider Gordon Bethune's ""From Worst to First"". It details a successful turnaround by an executive with both vision and hands-on command of how things actually work in organizations. Amelio seemed to lack both."
1,Forget the issues: it's poorly-written drivel.,"There's a lot of debate as to how realistic Amelio's opinions, expectations, and statements are, and I'm sure that many of the reviewers here have fine points. My issue, though, is that the computer community should be embarrassed by this book--not because of the content, but because we can accept this hack job (no pun intended) of a book. I don't think an editor even saw it from across the room: I've never seen a book published by a major house that was this poorly written. It's one trite comment after another. The Shakespeare analogy at the beginning is both pretentious and horrifying, and portends what is a truly terribly-written book. I found it almost unreadable."
2,What a Nice Guy I am!,"I found the book to be, how can I say this, ONE SIDED. Thisguy, if you can believe all that's here, is really one hell of a niceguy, a great manager and a natural victim at big bad Job's hands. If you don't buy that then you must believe, as I do, that this guy is one of those people who got so far and then got blown away when he really needed to deliver and prove his worth. Too much 'aren't I great', 'I've been really hard done' by and 'I told you so' stuff in here for my liking. I read the book all the way through but had to force myself really. END"
1,"Inaccurate, Biased and Self Glorifying","Amelio's spin control is quite amusing and it's ironical how most readers fall for it. Anyone who knows Apple well would be able to see what a onesided, inaccurate and extremly misleading story this is. It's nearly as if the truth doesn't matter in the book and it's sad to see someone who's supposedly done so well in American industry stoop so low. Added to that most of Amelio's ""successes"" in the book weren't really his own and unlike Jobs who at least acknowledges the key engineers and Apple folk who really make the succeses Gil prefers to keep all the credit to himself.It's a fast paced, once sided, misleading read."
3,Super Bad Indeed!,"I like this album. I bought it when it first came out way back in '82. Sounds sort of dated now, but jams like ""Lightfootin"", ""Il Macquiage Lady"", ""Get You Into Our Love"" and ""There's No Stopping Us"" are upbeat and danceable and could have been good singles back in the day, given a chance. It's a shame they had to score a hit with a Motown cover, and a near hit with a safe ballad ""All The Man I Need"". Lot's of good stuff to be found here."
2,Questionable Clamping Power,"It clamps snug to a bench, and does not move, however the working clamp is not impressing me so far. I've tried clamping several things, from copper pipes clamped lightly to solid steel tool bits clamped with maximum force, and no matter how lightly or tightly I clamp things down, the working piece seems to move around in the direction of the openings. The whole thing is painted a glossy orange, including the clamp jaws, so maybe I need to sand that down. It's like the jaws need to be knurled or something to give it grip. Perhaps the intent of this small vise is to use it for delicate items, and the smooth surface helps things from being damaged, but so far I'm using this for tools and other heavy duty things, so I would appreciate some better gripping power.I may edit my review if I decide to sand the jaw faces and they start to grip better, but right now I'm not terribly impressed."
4,Nice Vise,"It's a pretty nice clamp and it does what it is supposed to do. Seems solidly built with little lash in the moving parts. Jaws are neither textured nor ground flat -- just a painted, cast finish which seems a little bit cheap. Otherwise it's a nice unit!"
5,Great Little Vise!,"I have used Pony pope clamps for many years so I wasn't surprised at the quality of this little vise. Screw and guides are nice and tight and for small projects, this is hard to beat. It is certainly worth the money and works perfectly for small projects."
4,Helpful size and good price.,Just the right size and weight for what I need. I can make jigs for it to allow using at different angles and orientations. Very pleased.
5,Great music from a legend!,"I wasn't sure how much I'd like his spiritual music since I was a big fan of his early recordings on Original Rolling Stone. With the first listen, I was impressed and pleased! For a 75 year old man to still play guitar this well is something to appreciate. I totally agree with the previous review by ""Front Porch Sitter"" and could not describe it any better. --- NOTE: If you are a serious fan, please seek out ""Robert Wilkins/Tom Dickson/Allen Shaw - Memphis Blues 1928-35"" on Document Records. Although it has been reported that this CD contains only the same tracks as ""Original Rolling Stone"", it is incorrect. There are 3 tracks that are NOT on that CD and is definitely worth having!"
4,Great product,"I love the product, it works great. Easy to start, runs great. For wet leaves, I remove the screen. It probably doesn't mulch as fine without it, but it doesn't clog either. The instructions say that it does not ship with oil. This is not true. It ships with some oil, but not enough to operate it. Don't be fooled by seeing oil on the dip stick. You need to put in 19 oz of oil before starting. Otherwise the engine will lock up and you'll have to have a short block installed."
4,RELIABILITY,"Theses things are tried and true.You can always count on a c- clamp.I know that lately all kinds of new clamps have sprouted everywhere and a lot of them are great but, there will always be room in my tool chest for c-clamps. Their uses are endless. These are well made and of good quality and should last you forever.I do recommend them highly. Now get out there and clamp something."
3,"Valid points, but a bit of a Rant.","The main problem with this book is its obvious anti-Christian bias. Sometimes it's almost a rant rather than an essay. Too bad, because the underlying facts are mostly true. Had this book been written in a more scholarly manner by a more dispassionate scholar, it would be more trustworthy and therefore more valuable. Of course, it may be that it was written in the style of the time (quite some time ago). Certainly interesting."
1,Many inaccuracies,"I want to begin by saying that I am an atheist. However, I was born into a Hindu family. Many of the similarities that the author draws between Krishna and Jesus are wrong. Mia or Maya was not Krishna's mother, no one was claiming that Krishna was born of a virgin, etc. Most of all, he was not crucified, much less crucified alongside thieves. The story goes that Krishna was shot in the foot by an arrow. I only know about the story of Krishna because I have a Hindu background and I havent read the part about Indra yet. However, I'm not going to read anymore, the author has lost all credibility with me."
1,"As Funny as a Chick Tract, perfect for smug self-satisfied loosers","If you are a fuming democrat or liberal, and if obvious substitutional humor tickles your funny bone, then this is the book for you. An example of what is on offer here: the cover features a cartoon of George W. Bush, caricatured as a gorilla, in a head shot pose of Rodin's ""The Thinker.""Yuck yuck yuck!Stay tuned for my own edition on former President Clinton modeled on author David Martin's guidelines. The cover will feature a picture of Clinton modeled on the Pompeiian House of the Vettii's portrait of Priapus weighing his prodigous member.As Jack Chick would say, ""Haw-Hawwwwwww."""
5,The little one loves it!,This was for my 6 year old and she loves it. Loves pacman and she can easily play it for hours!
5,Excellent game!,"I really like this game. I have played it over 100 times already, and I have beaten it alot of times. It is so much better than Super Mario 64 DS because the controls are way easier. I also like the graphics because they remind me of Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie. I also like the fact that you can unlock the original Pac-Man arcade game. I have played it, and it brings back a few memories. Overall, I think that this is a fun game, and it is definitely a must-have for your DS collection. I hope that they come out with a sequel to this game because I think that would be cool."
1,Quick delivery put the postage was steep,The hat was a cheap price - but the delivery fee was way too much! The item was disappointing too - this was really just a costum hat that would fit a child and not an adult. I ended up using another hat to complete my outfit.
4,Good,"This is a big nice ice pack and lays like a blanket of cold. You will need a towel when using it, because being so large, it draws a lot of water conensation."
5,"Cold Pack - Oversize. Purchased at Amazon,",The cold pack arrived in excellent condition and was exactly as advertised. I use it every day and I have no complaints.
1,"Only good for 2 months, then its trash.","These blue vinyl models only last a couple of months & then leak.Spend a dollar more & get ColPaC's black Polyurethane models that are ""Designed for heavy clinical use""."
2,"""Under Par"" is more like it","Under Review is actually ""Under Par"" since the great songs we know and love are only snippets and they are never played in their entirety. The interviews are not going to tell you anything you don't already know from reading the Johnny Rogan book ""The Severed Alliance"" (yes, I know, the one Moz wants us to boycott), or from looking at any Smiths fan site. I feel ripped off, but maybe you will watch the Smiths collection of videos ""The Complete Picture"" and save money and time by skipping this offering. It should also be noted that this is an unofficial dvd, and hopefully Moz and Marr didn't approve of this second rate documentary. I am almost a completist so I think it is my job to share that the best part of the dvd is the quiz on Smiths trivia toward the end-I scored an 18 of 25-I'm sure you can do better!"
4,Excellent storytelling and musicianship,"So I was in the music store, trying to find something new, and I came across Stan Ridgway. I knew next to nothing about him, and the only track I recognized by title was Mexican Radio. It's now one of my favorite discs; a definite Desert Island pick for me. Stan's music is an acquired taste; extremely quirky but with excellent production values and a host of well-crafted song-stories. Reminds me of, in a way, the way Lou Reed and Tom Verlaine don't sing as much as narrate the stories they tell. A great sense of humor... I love the sad-sack storylines contained in the songs Can't Complain, Overlords, Peg & Pete & Me, and I Wanna Be a Boss. Lonely Town is a great ballad-type song... for him, at least. I have this disc with me for every long road-trip."
4,Good overview of a unique artist,"I don't actually own this collection but, having most or all of Stan's solo stuff, I think this is actually a pretty good overview or introduction to his stuff, though it would have been even better if it had ""Big Dumb Town"". After his third album, things became much more spotty and this picks out some of the best from his work. If you want more after this I'd start with Mosquitos, then the Big Heat, and go from there."
5,QUIRKY GENIUS,"Stan is the man when it comes to unique songwriting. It's a strange mixture of storytelling, new wave,western music, marching drums and everything else thrown in. Two songs are from his former band, Wall of Voodoo, and one features an ex-Police bandmember. This is a must buy!"
5,I love this CD,This is a great CD and I love listening to it. I would recommend it to any one who likes alternative music.
3,a partial genius,"There really are not enough good tracks on here to make it worth buying unless you are a fan. For ""Mexican Radio"" alone it was worth it for me but now you can dowlaod it, I have since sold the CD itself. That's pretty much it as far as killer tracks."
4,Pretty Good,"I thought that they were an excellent group. I heard them at Fun in the Son 1999 in Ocean City, New Jersey. I bought both this CD and their second CD, titled ""Still Waters"". I also got their signatures on the CDs and a poster. I would recommend this music not primarily as Christian, but simply as good music."
4,floor finish,"This product make my cherry hardwood floors look like new. I had a very large rug in my family room for years, after replacing it with a smaller rug the hardwood had a lighter color. After applying the Bruce finish, it all blended in. But be very careful because you cannot go back over a place or you will have a mess. You have to apply very evenly the first time."
2,Nowhere near as good as the first one,"I was very disappointed with the collection. The first volume of City Lounge was interesting and eclectic. This one is almost half full of rap and or hip/hop songs (not my favorites), most of which are not any good. The songs of other types are in general uninteresting. There are a few here and there that are at least ""listenable"", and a couple that I even like, but for the most part it is not worth it. In fact, there is one song that was on the first volume! That is just lazy. Overall this was a waste of money. I'm not going to bother with buying the third collection now, as this one has soured me on the whole idea."
4,It's good,4 stars because it's not the greatest omglolwtf amazingI would pay .... $25 for it. It's that good.I buy a rediculous amount of CDs... and going above $13 is rare for me
4,Good introduction to this outstanding innovative band,"Marillion have been a long time favorite band of mine - so this review will be biased. This album is good for those who want to sample some of Marillion's best tunes. If you like rich, challenging melodies contrasted against a backdrop of variations then this album is worth buying. If you like this - try ""Misplaced Childhood"", ""Brave"" and the latest release ""Radiation"" . ""This Strange Engine"", ""Seasons End"" and ""Fugazzi"" are all 4 star efforts. If you like Marillion, other suggested listening: - Simple Minds (""Real Life"", Sparkle in the rain"") - Yes (""Fragile"", ""Close to the Edge"") - Styx (""Paradise Theater"") - Peter Gabriel (""So"") - Genisis (earlier material) - Alan Parsons (""Tales of Mystery and Imagination"", ""Eye in the sky"", ""Stereotomy"")"
5,Wow!,"The best CD that Marillion ever put out. Yes, it is made of their greatest with both singers, Fish and H, but this CD blew me away. ""Sympathy"" was a great way to end the recording."
4,A GOOD LITTLE COMPRESSOR,"THIS IS A GOOD COMPRESSOR FOR THE HOMEOWNER/DIY-ER WHO WANTS THE POWER TO RUN NAIL GUNS, BUT DOESN'T NEED THE SIZE REQUIRED BY A PRO. I HAVE USED MINE TO RUN A CONSTRUCTION NAILER (PORTER-CABLE FR-350), A COIL-ROOFING NAILER (BOSTICH), ALONG WITH OTHER TOOLS. THE 5.8 GALLON TANK MANAGED TO KEEP UP WITH ME AS LONG AS I DIDN'T RAPID-FIRE TOO MANY TIMES. A GOOD VALUE ESPECIALLY WHEN BUYING THE PACKAGE DEAL (COMPRESSOR,NAILER,HOSE). DOWN-SIDE: ITS AWKWARD TO CARRY, THE WHEELS DON'T ROLL VERY WELL ACROSS THE YARD, AND THE SINGLE FOOT DESIGN HAS A HABIT OF SINKING INTO THE DIRT. ( NONE OF WHICH MATTERS IF YOU LEAVE IT IN THE GARAGE AND ADD EXTRA AIRHOSE INSTEAD.)"
3,This is not what you might expect!,"Still the great songs from their previous album ""Red Sonic Underwear"",a milestone in industrial-metal,hammering in my head,this record was a big disappointment for me.Not that the songs are bad but they lack the agression and power of ""RSU"" which is fascinating from the beginning to the end.""PLP 3""is not zeroes,but it's definitely not ones!!!"
2,Great First 2 Months -- Then Not So Good,"Initially I thought this was an awsome product as it worked flawlessly. I was able to setup several different on and off settings for each weekday and weekend days. After the first 2 months I notice all the display locations were completely on so you couldn't read anything; until it was unpluged and it worked fine again. I reset it back to default, reconfigured all the settings and plugged it back in. Once again every display item was on so you couldn't read anything. It wasn't really a big deal since it was still working. Then after a couple more months it stopped turning things on and off. Now it's completely useless. I did get several good months out of this unit but I was expecting years..."
1,stopped working,Had this thing for a month and noticed it started turning my appliance on and off at different times after three weeks. I attempted to reset it but the display is missing elements in and i cannot see the days of the week i want to set. I have contacted the company for a return because no return info came with the unit.
1,Short Lived Product,"I have tried with two, guess I'm a slow learner. The first one worked well for three months then scrambled images appeared and it developed a personality of it's own. The second one had it own way from the first like it does not understand AM or PM settings."
1,Not to happen with the timer,"I bought two woods 59377 timers, not too hard to program but after a few days one of them lost the settings. So I reprogrammed and a few days later it lost the settings again screen would just blink. Sent it back and got a new one now the other one is doing the same thing. Will be sending this one back also. I bought a brinks and it seems to be holding settings.Not recommended!"
1,Not worth the price,"I purchased this timer because it had two outlets. The first one I received was faulty, the display did not activate and there was no way to start/set it.The replacement I received after I returned it lasted exactly one day....again, the display went into default mode and I was unable to reset anything.When I unplugged the timer from the outlet I noticed a rattling sound inside, as if something inside had popped (fuse?). There is also a 'dimple' on the side of the unit that I did not notice earlier.Concerned that maybe my outlet was the problem I had my local electrician test it (no problem), then plugged in another timer and have had no problem since.Most likely there is a flaw in the electrical wiring inside the Woods timer.The Woods timer is going back to Amazon - again. This time for a refund."
1,Received a dud.,"I received this timer and the lcd had a display on it. I put it away for a week and now it won't even work. No lcd display. Battery doesn't ""charge"" and it doesn't even turn on. Piece of crap product."
3,Great when it works.,"I got one of these with the purchase of a Super Feeder cat feeder. It's easy to program and works well. I've had it for over 2 years with no problems. If they were all like this, I would very highly recommend the item.However, I bought another one for my fish tank and it arrived in DOA condition. The screen on the item was all blacked out (All 8's on the display) and nothing worked. I have asked Amazon for a replacement, so we'll see if the 2nd one works.**Update - the 2nd one works fine**"
1,electronic controller quit working,this timer is too complicated to program. after 6 months it stopped timing completely and just left the light on.
1,failure within months after purchase,I purchased four of the Woods digital timers. I returned one unit immediately to Amazon and received a credit for the purchase price. I programmed the other three and used them to turn on and off small table lights. Within a year all three of these timers failed. The warranty period is one year.Other digital timers have lasted for years which is what I expected from the Woods considering the price of $17.00 each.
1,Terrible product!,I bought two of these and both have completely failed with in months or days. Woods does not care one bit about the problem. Read all the bad reviews. They just quit working for no reason. Dont trust these one bit with your house!! Why would Woods even sell these is my question??
1,Broke after only 3 weeks....,"Yup, I second everyone else's statements. Don't bother buying this darned thing, it just is not worth your money or time."
1,Only work for one year,"This product works fine, but only for about one year. After that, it dies. Just like other reviewers say, I see 8888.88 on the screen. It means it is not working anymore.I reprogrammed it. Then it went 8888 again after couple days. Repeat the process.It is not hard to program. Really. But why bother if it works only for one year?I should have read the reviews before buying it."
3,"Woods 59377 Digital 7-Day Lamp/Appliance Timer with 2 Outlets, Up to 8 On/Off Settings per day and Battery Back Up",It works as advertised but it could use to be improved when it comes to programing - if you dont program all 8 setting it won't operate properly so read the directions carefully and program all 8 on off settings even if they are all the same.
1,Never worked,"Straight out of the box, this timer never worked. I couldn't even set the time, much less program it to do anything. Absolutely useless."
2,"Tough to program, poor life span","As others have stated, the programming is a little tough, the ""manual"" button requires a bit of attention to get right. I used this to switch a block heater (12.5 Amps) for a diesel car. It sat in an unheated garage to perform this duty. Failure mode started with loss of display elements, then loss of programming and finally completely unreadable, garbled display. Failure was less than 3 years."
1,"Two worked for 5 months, then they both bust","I bought three of these gadgets in June 2011, and immediately began using two of them. After around five months, one stopped working, and a week later the other one. On both occasions the gadgets were opened and I found that part of the circuit board was darkened, as if burnt. So much for ""heavy duty"". All they had been doing was, in two separate houses that run solely on solar energy, turn the refrigerator on in the morning and off at night. And they weren't put to this use all of the five months --only when the days had been cloudy and we doubted there'd be enough electricity in the solar batteries to last the night while the fridge was on. And these are small fridges, more like the minibars in dorms or hotel rooms, that consume less than an amp per hour. I'm really disappointed. The third one is still in storage, I've been wondering whether to use it or not."
1,Disappointed item,"I bought two timers,this Timer is very bad set-up and not clear informations,and the woods Timer is clear,easy set-up.I tried to set 2 hours,but not working as i want,just for christmas lamps and tree,don't need for down or dusk??Then i threw it to the trash.I have to bought 2 more WOODS Timers."
1,DO NOT BUY,I purchased 10 of these. It looks fantastic but the display quickly fades out and becomes unusable. Each one has since stopped working altogether. A terrible piece of technology.
1,Negative Star,I bought this to use on an appliance. I unpacked it looked at it's features and was VERY impressed. I ended up NEVER using it. About 9 months later I found a use for it. I plugged it in and it DIDN'T work. I know that it is my fault for not testing it when I first received but several of the other reviews stated similar stories. I looked for a warranty but found nothing. Do yourself a favor and pass.
2,"No instructions, doesn't work.","I ordered this because I need a 15 amp unit with versatile programming. The unit arrived in a sealed package, but no instructions. After an hour of trying to program it (and having it spontaneously reset every few minutes), I concluded that the unit was defective and am returning it. I'm now guessing the unit was bad and returned then shipped again."
2,Needlessly complex,"This is a basically functional product, but ridiculously complex. You get it to start and stop an electric device. It has scads of other useless functional and a LENGTHY programming time. Blah. Get a simpler one."
1,Worst product ever,This junk does not work. What more is there to say. Only the biggest mooncalf will buy this product after reading this review.
1,Fried after 3 months,"I purchased this outlet timer based on the previous review and was VERY happy when I received it. It had all the features I wanted:1. two grounded outlets2. room so when it is plugged into a 2-plug outlet, you can still usethe second outlet.3. very easy to program4. battery backup (we have frequent power outages)5. quiet operation (the mechanical ones I find quite loud).In my searching, there is nothing else on the market that has these features. I also purchased one of the cheaper,non-grounded Woods models.Everything worked beautifully until our last power outage. I noticedthe lights did not turn off. I pulled the timer out and it was fried.When I shook it, black carbon came out and it rattled. For the record,I don't think we had a surge as no other electronics in the house hadany problems, including two computers. It could be that I just boughta lemon. The other Woods outlet is working fine."
2,One out of Three,"Just ordered 3 of these timers for my children's TV's. One has worked properly right out of the package , but the other two will not set and activate properly. I have to manually add time to the TV timer to allow the TV to ever come up. The programming option will not work properly."
1,Dead on arrival,"How can they ship a product that is completely dead? When plug in to outlet, nothing happen. The quality control for this company is really bad."
1,Did not last long,"I used this outlet for about a week and it fried. Its display is all completely lit up and the buttons are useful. I've tried resetting it, removing batteries, etc. and nothing helps."
3,Didn't last,"Even though tis timer is rated for high wattage, it didn't last very long. I found the controls very combersome as well."
3,Hopefully will be good,Unfortunately I recieved a defective unit.....rma process easy and fast. Recently reordered the same thing and am hoping for better luck this time. Timer has great features and a good price...if I can get one that works!
4,Great Timer,Got this to monitor my coffee pot. Works Great. Coffees ready when I get up in the morning and I don't have to worry about shutting it off an hour later. Would give it a 5 but it would have been nice if I could set each outlet for a different time. Easy to set.
2,Not a good timer,"I have had this timer for less than a month, in use every day and it just stopped working. The internal rechargable battery stopped working. Don't buy it- quality is not good!"
2,Worked pretty good at first...,"Despite some of the negative reviews on Amazon, I took a chance and ordered this a few weeks ago. I used it to turn my espresso machine on ~30 minutes before waking up. It worked nice for 3 weeks, today it stopped working. All the LCD lights are stuck on.I should mention that there was loose parts rattling around in it since I opened it new. After it stopped working today, I opened the thing up today to see what it was, there was 2-3 loose rubber parts that fell right out. Also some black powder residue was inside it."
2,Item Broke after one week,"I am sending this back for a refund. Worked great for a week. Then, I went to unplug it and switch to another outlet and it stopped working. I am thinking about getting another and seeing if that one works, as it is a cool product if it works, but will probably look for something else similar that has better reviews. Disappointing."
5,Fantastic Timer for a Low Price,"I purchased two of these digital timers to replace a couple of old mechanical timers. I did not like having every day be the same schedule. I wanted the pond waterfall on more during the weekends then during the week. This digital timer made it easy to do, and since it has two outlets, it can handle a pond pump and a UV filter. The programing was very easy and since it has battery backup, your settings will not go away during a power outage.I just ordered two more so I can replace another pair of old mechanical timers."
4,Woods Digital Timer Setup,"We are using this on all the coffee makers in our building to shut off the heaters at night and weekends. The manual override allows for use if needed during off hours.Woods 59377 Digital 7-Day Lamp/Appliance Timer with 2 Outlets, Up to 8 On/Off Settings per day and Battery Back UpThe setup options are great.We used the M-F as we are only occupied 7am to 5pm M-F.This shuts of the water heaters in the coffee makes and any burners that are on.We used to burn up a pot or two every month."
3,Works or Did,Product works great. Have had no issues with it. It looks complicated but it's actually easy to set up and use. Update - After using this product for a few months it stopped working and I had to replace it.
1,dead on arrival,"I purchased this timer and kept it unopened for a few months and then tried to use it when my old Stanley died. It is dead. No LCD readout, even after being plugged in overnight, pushing reset button, etc. Poor troubleshooting info, no mention of customer service number, website, or warrantly in enclosed manual. You take a risk if you buy this. I bought it for the ""rechargeable backup battery,"" which is nonreplaceable and nonfunctioning. It looks to be straight from China with little effort to help the customer with info. Shame. Look elsewhere unless you feel lucky. What is with all these electronic timers?"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"The first timer I received failed to turn a lamp on and off even though I was able to program the timer. I received a replacement that worked for about 18 months, then failed in the same way."
4,Very useful and cheaper online!,This item arrived quickly. It arrived in excellent condition. It worked exactly like it was supposed to. The item met a special need very well. Thank you Amazon for having it.
2,Filled a need but didn't last.,"I got this to run some small fans to circulate the AC when I was at home and turn off while I was at work. The timer worked well and was easy enough to program. After about a year I moved and was going to use this timer with some lamps. When I went to program it I noticed that the display only works when it is not plugged in. When it was the display would change so that you would have to lay on the floor to read it and it would still be hard to read. I loved the fact you could override this and then it would take over timing when a set point time arrived, but the poor display made determining which mode your were in(override ON, timer ON, override OFF, timer OFF) made using impossible."
1,Another Defective Woods Timer,"Like a number of reports from other reviewers, mine was defective out of the box. I will return it, though I don't know if I will exchange for the same model. I didn't like the way you have to crane your neck sideways to see the display when it's plugged in, and even with craning the neck it's almost impossible to see the display properly. You don't realize that from the photo - that it's so awkwardly designed."
1,save your money,Bought 3 of these units and all were dead in 15 months. Of course warranty is 12 months.Give credit to Woods as they responded to my e-mail immediately but units were out of warranty.Was great while they lasted.
3,If the worst they can say is that it ends too soon...,"A far different read than I expected. I was immediately engaged by the characters, and read it straight through in one sitting. To my surprise, I found the plot to be quite unpredictable. I would tend to agree that it ends too soon, but only from desire of continuing my involvement with the characters, not as a literary criticism. The character of the mother of the ""monster"" was the soul of the book - vividly realized with great insight and compassion. A poignant commentary on humanity... don't judge this one by appearance."
4,Just as expected,"Tent was just as expected, no issues with good quality. Good sized and sets up very quickly (5min). My kids 5yrs and 11mo have been using it everyday for several weeks with no issues. The included back pack is also of good quality and my daughter now uses it for school. I would recommend this product."
4,The tent is great; the extras are cheaply made,"We purchased this tent set for my 3-year old daughter. She LOVES princesses and loves to sleep in this tent in her bedroom. The tent itself is very cute, sturdy, and simple to put up and take down. The sleeping bag is a big hit with our daughter, and is just fine for sleeping indoors (we have not tried it outdoors). The backpack that came along with it fell apart quite quickly - the zipper's edge has frayed and the side pockets have ripped. The water bottle is not dishwasher safe, which is not as fun for Mom when the bottle has been sitting with juice in it for awhile. However, we didn't buy this for the backpack or water bottle, we bought it for the tent. The tent has been great and has made our daughter happy."
5,A Christmas Day Hit!,"This was not on my 3 yr. old daughter's Christmas list, but because she's very much into the princess stuff this year, I thought this would be fun. This has turned out to be the year's best gift. My daughter LOVES it and I do too for the value! It is her own little ""nook"". I can fit inside comfortably to play with her, she is able to zip and unzip it easily and it's so easy to put up. She also enjoys the sleeping bag, full-sized backpack and water bottle. Santa was ""right on"" with this one!!"
2,"Kids love it, but poor quality","Our 2 daughters love camping out (indoors), but the first time we set it up, one of the poles snapped. I've worked with tents for a long time, so I know that I did not bend it beyond it's initial design."
3,"Great tent, bad tent poles","My daughter loves her tent...but after two nights 4 of the tent poles have broken. I'm now faced with finding replacement poles (another errand to run, but of course our daughter is worth it)."
4,Diseny Princess Camping Kit,"I bought this Camping set for my daughters 3rd birthday! She LOVES it! The tent, sleeping bag and backpack are great! The compass and water bottle are cheap, but no matter the tent is well made and the sleeping bag and backpack are too! Perfect for a wild 3 year old! She was thrilled when she opened the box and now all her friends want a Princess Tent too! The tent is good for inside and out, I can set it up by myself, and to take it down is very easy as well! Great buy at $40!!!"
2,Not very sturdy,"Tent is very cute but not very sturdy. A friend of my daughters (3 years old) lost her balance and just barely fell on it and one of the wooden rods broke and now the tent won't sit level on the ground. Also, there were no instructions as to how to put it together. Wouldn't buy this one if I could do it all over again."
4,Disney Princess Complete Kids Camping Kit,"My daughter loves to play with all of the items included. A little on the cheap side, but she doesn't care so I don't either. It will last as long as she's still interested in it."
3,Don't get what's in picture/description,"It does not come with a water bottle and full sized backpack, like pictured and written in the description. Mine came with a pink flashlight instead of the water bottle. The so-called back pack is more of a sack with a drawstring. It's a gift for my niece so I haven't seen it all in person yet. I'm wondering how it all fit into the little box they sent it in, though. We'll see how it goes."
3,Disney Princess Complete Kids Camping Kit,"I purchased theDisney Princess Complete Kids Camping Kiton August 11th for my granddaughter's birthday on October 4th. Several weeks after she received it, the zipper on the backpack broke. Since it is now past the 60 days, I cannot return it for a replacement. I really only want a replacement of the backpack, since the rest of the set is not broken and she loves it. A little 4 year old would certainly love to receive a replacement for her backpack."
4,A Must for Mississippi John Hurt Fans!,"You get an up close and personal view of Mr. Hurt on Memorial Anthology. Many of the tracks were recorded in a relaxed, small audience venue and convey a warmth missing from other Hurt recordings. Guitar work is mesmerizing as always. There is an interview included in the anthology which gives the listener a greater understanding of Mr. Hurt, his times and his music."
2,10 karat looks better,"I don't know anything about gold, so maybe this is typical, or maybe it is some kind of discoloration.Whatever the cause, every time I see the 14 karat version of this pen in a store, it looks halfway like copper. You can see some difference on the Cross website, although their stock image actually looks better than the real thing.Both the higher-content 18 karat pens AND the lower 10 karat models look more like gold. If you want a ""gold"" pen, I would save some money and get the cheaper 10 karat model. It's a little paler than the 18 karat, but it still looks like gold."
3,C-Clamp,"according to the picture,I thought I was getting a deep c-clamp. Instead I recieved a regular c-clamp. Not what I had ordered, but it did manage to the job I bought it for. Picture is very decieving."
2,Not for those with Milk Allergy,"Ms. Zukin's book is probably an invaluable resource for those who cannot tolerate lactose, but those of us who are allergic to milk protein will find dangerous information in this book.She lists as ""dairy-free"" products which clearly contain milk (Wendy's bread sticks contail ""skim milk""; their hamburger buns contain ""sodium caseinate""). These are not items that have changed over the years; my dairy-allergic son has never been able to eat Wendy's buns,and he's nearly 13 years old.The recipes are fairly good, though I get irked by reading ""milk substitute"" in them - I'd rather see the brand name of the product she used (soy milk tastes very different from rice milk, for instance).With this book, as with every packaged food product, you must read carefully and be certain the food she mentions is safe. You can't take her word for it. The title, therefore, is quite misleading.I won't buy another book written by this author."
1,"Working hard, or hardly working?","I, too own the Betty Crocker Cookbook, and I, too, am capable of a simple search & replace string for phrases. It seems to me that the author simply took recipies from established cookbooks, and replaced every instance of the word ""butter"" with ""milk-free margerine"", the word ""milk"" with ""milk-free milk substitute"", and ""cream"" with the words ""non-dairy richwhip"". With a remarkable lack of knowledge about the difference between lactose intolerance and actual non-dairy living, she approaches the reader with what were probably good intentions, but merely comes off as misinformed. This book is fine if you are lactose intolerant. However, if you are truly trying to live diary-free, give it a miss. Also, if you're frugal, just take a pencil to your battered copy of Betty Crocker, and sub out the ingredients yourself. Maybe a publisher will buy your work, too."
4,A very thorough book about all aspects of living dairy free,"As the mother of a three year old daughter with both milk and egg allergies, I found this book was extremely helpful with all aspects of living milk free. It includes sections on infants and children, shopping and eating out as well as supplying addresses for some of the better known fast food chains who will send you updated information on which of their products are dairy free. The recipes are great and even include some that are egg free. I personally used egg replacer(found in health food stores) and a teaspoon of arrowroot(for firmness) in some of her baking recipes and most came out very good. The only problem with including products that are dairy free is that manufactures frequently change recipes and I would not want anyone to buy somethi ng from these lists thinking they are dairy free when they may not still be."
1,Disappointing,"I purchased this in hopes of getting more recipe ideas that call for no dairy products, or at least the option to use them or not (like topping things w/cheese). I was sorely disappointed to receive this book and realize very quickly that it's nothing more than a bunch of normal recipes I could've found in any book, but just says to use ""dairy free milk/cheese/sour cream substitute,"" etc. Useless. I didn't need a recipe book to tell me that. I know I have those options. But there are plenty of recipes out there that don't call for any ingredients w/dairy, or use oil, shortening, etc. as substitutes. I was hoping the recipe book had done that legwork and I could just enjoy trying some new things. Not so. Waste of money."
2,Too much margarine!!,"If you are looking for a dairy-free cookbook that does not rely on the use of margarine, this is NOT the one you should buy!I was very disappointed to find that a huge number of recipes in this book require the use of margarine. Margarine contains unhealthy hydrogenated trans-fats, and it is extremely bad for you. It is not something I want to be putting into my body, and I am a bit surprised that Ms. Zukin would choose this as a butter substitute.There are other substitutes (such as unrefined coconut fat) that are much healthier. Unfortunately, I do not have the time or patience to experiment with replacing margarine with coconut fat in so many of her recipes.I have yet to find a dairy-free cookbook that provides a healthy butter substitute."
4,works but I believe there are better,"I have had this little guy for almost 3 years now, always served me well but lately the dripping increased so much that I have to hold it away from me so that I don't get wet. Other than that, it does its job very good."
2,noz,"there is a position in my nelson nozzle that unfortunaly doesn't works. it is the soaker position. the wather doesn't comes trough .this is bad, becouse it's too dificoutl to change it, since i live in Brasil. the others positions works ok. it is made for a male hand, it is hard to use for a long time, with my female hands."
2,Description of item incorrect,"Contrary to how this item is described, there are no 'safety straps to secure the solid back to wheelchair', with no way to attach cushion to the wheelchair, the cushion would not stay in place, and would be a constant source of frustration; I returned the one I had ordered."
5,Every Arizona Citizen Should Read This Book,"This book contains a very interesting history of Arizona, and an explanation of the rights of Arizona citizens under the constitution. It clearly explains the often confusing processes of initiative, referendum, and recall and also details the layout and powers of each governmental branch. The whole book is in an easy to understand, conversational tone. If you want more information on something she talks about, she provides endnotes with explanations and sources. Every citizen of Arizona should have a copy of the book to read and consult. The book is concise, interesting, and just long enough to tell you almost everything you want to know about Arizona's government."
3,Not enough for the Arizona test!,"This book was amazingly well written and easy to follow. I enjoyed learning more about the Arizona government. However, I don't think that it was enough to study for the Arizona Constitution test for teacher certification."
5,More than enough,"Although Rock the Boat was eventually chosen as the second single from Aaliyah's self-titled album, she was able to shoot a video for More Than a Woman and perform it live on shows like The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Regis & Kelly, and The View. Trading in Timbaland's trademark futuristic/unique beats for a more glossy pop sheen, but still rooted in R&B. Baby Girl asks a man to choose her as his girl and that ""we can be like Bonnie and Clyde/I'll be by your side"" over a revved up backdrop. Excellent choice for a third single that perfectly sums up how the fans felt about Aaliyah."
5,Forever More Than A Woman,This is a great song.Aaliyah proves that she is more than a woman on her final CD.Her legacy will forever live on through her beautiful music.
5,The Subtlety of Plaid,"I highly recommend this book to anyone. From start to finish, the story grabs you and doesn't let go for a second. The author presents the characters in such a way that you can't help but to feel their every emotion. I simply couldn't put it down and look forward to the author's next arrival. An excellent read!"
2,Very Disappointed,"I have been a huge Darrell Evans fan since I first started listening to his music back in 1999, so I was very excited when I learned he had a new CD coming out. Naturally, I bought it right away. Needless to say, I was very disappointed with this CD. The songs did not capture me like previous Darrell Evans CD's had. Often, music has to grow on me, so I tried playing the CD a number of times, but it didn't get any better. The songs on this CD just don't seem to have the same kind of inspiration many of his earlier songs have. The production of the CD is not very good either.If you are looking for a Darrell Evans CD, I would highly recommend either ""Let the River Flow"" or ""Freedom"". Those are both awesome albums. So, my recommendation is to not waste your money on this CD."
5,Seriously picky about my pens,"I love these pens. They are fast and smooth-flowing, and you can't beat the price. I use them to write in my Moleskine journal and the thickness of the ink is perfect for the heft of the paper; it doesn't bleed through but is dark enough to be taken seriously when I read back on what I've written in the past. One pen will take me through almost an entire large journal from cover to cover."
3,I thought they were click pens.,I thought they were click pens. ... .. ... .... .... ... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... ...
3,good for the price,it has great style but it gets caught on stuff and then it will bend out of shape. it is pretty easy to bend back but it won't last long.
5,A must have for your Sony Camcorder,"This kit has everything you need to carry your camcorder around. The NP-FP71 battery alone could easily cost you more than $50 (which is the price for this kit) if you buy from elsewhere, and you even get the case and strap from this kit. I'd receommend this to anyone who owns a Sony camcorder that takes the NP-FP71 battery. It's definitely worth the money.Also, if you want to buy a spare battery, definitely go with the OEM one (which is the one included in this kit). Don't ever waste your money on the generic one. I bought a generic one at first to save some money, but later on found out it's almost unusable and regretted about it."
4,Good Purchase,The price through Amazon was great & it arrived sooner than expected. It fit the DCR-SR40 camera and the accessories needed for being on the go.
4,Sonly Accessory Kit for SR40 Camcorder,Case is minimal but servicable. Extended battery is excellent. Would be perfect if kit included 12 volt car (lighter) power cable.
1,Dont buy this product,"this product is a total non-sense.you might think you get 3 - bag, strap and battery for less price.if you want to buy a battery or a bag buy them seperately.the battery is tooooo big to fit and use in a small handy cam like DCR HC 36. the battery will fit into the camera, true i am not saying no. my finger will also easily fit into my car's charger port, i can not put my finger inside, right ? ? ?we want to buy a compact cam and we can not put such a huge battery on it, spoils the look and disturbs the camera operation.this obsctructs the record button - this is the main issue with this battery. you can not press the record button freely as u can do when u fit the default battery for the cam.i would advice buyers not to buy this product, instead buy a small battery for standby purposes."
5,A REAL PAGE_TURNER,"t was an act of vengeance, but Chad McClintock finally knew how to get even with his father. He'd seduce the young copper-haired beauty who was about to become his stepmother! Kristy Donovan was nothing but a fortune hunter anyway, and he had no qualms about carrying her off to an isolated cabin in the woods. But Chad was not prepared for the fiesty young woman whose flashing green eyes turned his angry passion into helpless desire. And even as Kristy cursed her arrogant captor, she warned to his sensual touch."
2,not for new ground,"This will wreck you if you only use it once a year! I am 5ft 11in 185 pounds. On new ground, I could fight this sucker for about 10 minutes before I had to stop, wringing wet with sweat, and rest. Any time it was tilling, it was bucking and jerking my arms out of their sockets while I am cussing it like a sailor! After the ground was thorougly tilled, it was fine for keeping weeds down if you used it more often than once a month. Perhaps all tillers are like this but the lesson I have learned over the years concerning small engines (a lesson I ignored -- to my own regret) is this: Pay the extra money and buy Honda. Honda seems to invest their time and money into engineering so their products do what they are desinged to do for a long time rather than investing in advertising to make their stuff last long enough to sell."
5,Great combo,Nice to have 3 good family movies on one dvd.Enjoy the holiday movies all year round.Well worth the money.
4,Great Family movies,"Enjoyed no sex, violence, bad language & fun in these movies. There is no real reference to why we really have Christmas, but if you want a movie that is safe for family-these work."
5,Hoilday movie,my family and I really enjoyed christmas.We enjoyed the movies will be able to enjoy them for years to come.
2,average stuff,"i bought this CD based on the great review on this page. also, i read some journals from HongKong also rated this CD very good. However, after listened to it for five times carefully w/o any preconceived notion, i have to say this is at best an average CD, in terms of writing, arranging and the general production. lara is a great singer no doubt but her music lacks power, passion and emotions. being a great fan of latin pop, i get much more powerful stuff from artists like alejandro sanz, cristian castro. the best track on this CD is ""rio"" yet it failed to deliver the intensity of rio. sorry about that.disappointment."
1,Be aware,"This is a Persian Wedding Reception Music CD....I am so thankful that I looked it up on another site, since there was no information on here about any of the songs. So unless you like this sort of music, then I suggest that you move on."
5,great stuff,"nice smell, rich feel to the lather. don't need much, especially since i put it on top of a bunch of coconut oil! good price and no hunting the stores for this staple."
3,widescreen?,the dvd was full frame that i got. the very same one that is pictured. i'm just wondering did i get the wrong aspect ratio because the case said WIDESCREEN? have other people had this problem or am i wrong about something? over all an excellent movie.
1,Pass it by,"In a word: boring. I love Christopher Lee, and would watch him in nearly anything, but this was just a boring film. Slow. Tedious. And the image quality isn't very good either. If this was the best available print of the film to transfer to DVD, I'm not sure I would have bothered. Washed out, poor contrast, and just not pleasant to look at. Pass this one up - I wish I had."
4,We know how to do it,"On Dread Zeppelin's third album, they go for a big change of pace. They still play songs in a combined Elvis/Zeppelin/reggae style, but this time they are mostly playing disco songs. The results are a lot of fun. I really get a kick out of this album. The songs are played with a reggae beat, but they will throw in a Zeppelin riff or an Elvis line. This album is not for everybody, but it is for me."
3,"Tortelvis disappears during the disco era, just like life?","This is an interesting experiment. Buttboy becomes the frontman (Gary B.I.B.B.) on this one and the Zep/Reggae/Elvis formula is applied to disco music. The best results occur in ""Jive Talkin'"", which melds the original tune with Zep's ""D'yer Maker"" and of course, the reggae feel and Elvis-style vocals. Buttboy proves a somewhat capable imitation, but there is truly only one Tortelvis. If his presence were on this album, it would have been a bit livelier I think. This album is a bit spotty at times (see ""Night Fever"") where the collision of the four styles feels a little clumsy, but is still an interesting idea. The experimentation of applying the DZ formula to songs that come from places *outside* of the formula would prove to be more fruitful with later efforts, (""Unchained Melody"", and ""Brick Houses of the Holy"" for examples) but the idea is a good one."
4,Solid record from a solid band,"As if an Elvis/Zeppelin/reggae combo wasn't weird enough, they went ahead and added disco to the mix on this one. Oh, and they have a new singer: Tortelvis goes on temporary hiatus, and is replaced by Gary B.I.B.B. No matter. The boys hammer everything into shape, and the results are pretty good. There's only one actual Zeppelin song on here (""Ramble On""), but they use plenty of Zep riffs throughout the other songs. The entire first half is killer, particularly ""Night Fever"" and ""Jungle Boogie"". The second half kinda drags, but it's not terrible. It appears this cd is no longer in print, which is a shame."
3,a little different,"Ok a friend of mine got me this because we both had different taste in music. the only other guy I knew who loved to sit and listen to Tom Waits. But he bought me this, he had been following the band for years. How many bands that has a lead singing being an Elvis impersonaitor could pull off covering zeppelin reggae style. It will make you laugh but they really nail it. I think its worth a listen or two."
3,All the King's Things,The book arrived on time and in the exact condition that was described. It was interesting to see all the things this woman had collected. I was expecting more content but it was mostly just pictures. All in all it was an ok purchase.
4,Museum Management,"The authors go into great detail discussing museum personnel, museum operations, and the financial realities of museum management. The extensive discussions and actual case studies that have been contributed by various professionals from museums, demonstrate the implementation of the management techniques discussed in the book.Throughout the book the authors explain their criteria for effective museum management by asking a series of questions that allow for reflection on current management practices. The book was created as the guide book for a certificate class in museum management."
4,Expand and Personalize the Traditional Mysteries,Brother Philip Armstrong offers some simple suggestions on how we might vary the mysteries of the rosary and expand them to include more of scripture and more from our own experience. He cites his own rosary prayers inspired by the African culture in Ghana and praying over the lives of those buried in the Holy Cross cemetery. His basis for expanding the conventional mysteries is the Pope's recent addition of the luminous mysteries. This work is filled with ideas and examples of possibilities for fashioning mysteries that are personally significant and spiritually enriching. This would be an excellent source book for faith-sharing groups.
2,Hello Kittys Animation Vol 4,Because the movie was poor quality almost all white You could hardly see it on the Television. it was very very light.
3,Gel moves away from bottom,It did not have enough cushioning for me. The gel moved away from the area that needed the cushioning. Product should be twice as thick or have compartments to restrain gel.
2,"Not enough padding, but in good condition.","The stadium gel seat was definitely smaller than I expected it to be. There also wasn't much padding, but it was delivered quickly and in good condition. I would probably recommend this product to a child, young teenager, or someone short and petite. If you want a small gel seat without a lot of padding, this product is right for you."
4,A Technician's review of the SKWOOSH Gel Seat,"I purchased the Skwoosh because I'm a copier technician. I have to sometimes kneel and/or sit on linoleum floors which hurts me without a cushion. I'm of thin build, I need extra padding. The Skwoosh is not as thick or comfortable as I would have liked. Even though it serves my needs well. I can fold the Skwoosh in half so it supports my knee when I'm kneeling on the floor, or when I put it away in my napsack. I also like that it has handles for easy handling. I would recommend this product to others. This product also caught my eye because of the reasonable price."
3,Simply ok - better than nothing at all...,"On the plus side: small, fits in my purse, better than nothing at all.On the minus side: not very thick, moves around (probably because of the fabric).I sat on this for an entire season of high school girls basketball-having never missed a game. Most of the stadiums/gyms (if you can even call them that) in our area are 50+ years old and have those horrible wooden bleachers. It took the edge off of my bum becoming numb. Would look for something a bit more padded for next season."
1,Disappointed,"Returned the seats as they are no better than the old fashioned ones - non gel - stadium seats we have been using for years. Perhaps expectations were unrealistic.If you need cushions, these may be as good as any and they are lightweight and somewhat weather proof otherwise, stick with what you have and save some money."
3,Review SKWOOSH Gel Seat,"Nice and compact, great for travel. I used these in a stadium with hard plastic seats and they could have provided a little more comfort, however we were sitting for long periods of time."
1,Junk,I tried to return this item and the return feature wouldn't work. I ordered it for my 78 year old Mother and if there's any gel in it they must have used an eyedropper to install it.
2,Made for people with built-in padding,Purchased this for NASCAR race and couldn't figure out if it was better to have little cushion for both cheeks or fair cushion for 1 cheek.
2,"handy, but doesn't provide any cushion","The item was received the next day and really looked great! Sturdy, easy to clean, convenient handle, fit easily into my back pack. It was even rather benign in that nobody really noticed me pulling it out along with books and notebooks and plopping it onto my chair at university, all of these are great, if you don't actually need a cushion between your buttocks and a hard surface which this does not provide. It also lifts you just enough to allow the front edge of the seat to cut into the backs of your thighs. Not only was it no help, it made things a bit worse. I do not recommend it for anyone except for those who can be fooled by the placebo effect."
3,"Good, but not great","This stands well apart from other incarnations of Harlock that I have seen. Harlock is not the same broody, mono-syllabic hero he is in the other series'. He's more personable in this one, and it didn't sit right with in all honesty. He even moves a lot more, rather than being like a statue that occasionally comes to life - which in the past created an incredible tension whenever he was present. Also the premise is a little bit difficult to swallow, even for anime..Positives - the artwork is brilliant. The very evocative nouveau style is even more pronounced here and it works well to create an air of mythology. The music is fantastic, lending seriousness, tension and grandeur to the production. Brilliant work there, no doubt about it - even though my personal preference is for the more scaled-back score from Arcadia of My Youth, with it's Robotech-esque haunting melodies."
2,Didn't impress me,"Let me put this blatantly. This anime was boring. I almost fell asleep watching the first four episodes.The plot didn't attract me. The animation isn't all that great, and it has a hardly better picture then the VHS. There is literally about 30 seconds of action, and the action that is shown is dull.I don't know, maybe I don't like it because I don't get Matsumoto's works(this is the first one I've seen). I recommend this as a rental instead of a buy."
2,"Slow, contrived plot","The plot is slow, and quite contrived. Some of the CG (mainly Harlock's ship) looks very out of place. They should have stuck to one style. The opening episode's plot's is left hanging.The in movie navigation starts with the opening sequence for every episode and the scene breaks don't put you at the continuation story - must resort to fast forward.Overall a very mediocre DVD."
5,The ultimate in delightful perversion,"I was new to Genitorturers, having only heard them on the Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines soundtrack, and decided to give them a shot; they certainly lived up to my gothic sensabilities.It's dark and hard hitting, with throaty lyrics and penetrating bass lines. The subject matter of the album covers every aspect of sexual liberation, from bdsm to masturbation; more that enough perversion for your inner deviant. The stage is set from begining to end for exploration and discovery of primal urges.120 Days of Genitorture has spun a significant amount in my cd player, and is an album I could listen to 'till my ears bleed; no wonder they recieve an honorable mention in the Tzimisce clan book. Genitorturers shatter preconcieved notions one song at a time."
4,This CD kind of scared me...but in a good way.,"Yeah, well, it did kind of scare me. But, like I said, it wasn't a negative experience...really, it was rather alluring. I'm not sure what I would classify the music as...I wouldn't say it was punk or metal or whatever else, but I can make one general assessment about it: it was damn erotic. I've never heard anything that DARKLY sensuous in all my aural escapades (with, perhaps, the exception of much of Die Form's work.) Gen really gets you to think and to question...not only the way you express yourself sexually, but also intellectually. She proved to me to be an acutely intelligent and thoughtful woman. That's a sexy thing. After all, what's more attractive than a woman with a fierce libido AND a fierce mind?"
4,"Rip, rip, destroy... music for violent / sensuous strippers","A fantastic solid album (at least the first seven songs). Sexy, mean, chunky, and tight are the best descriptive words I can find, but if you know what I sayin' and like what it means,YOU SHOULD OWN THIS CD(the second half of the cd is well tolerated). This cd is second only to an unforgettable live show."
3,Commentary?,Is there any commentary on this disc like Strahan's from the last Giants Super Bowl? I might get it if there were something like that.
5,superbowl 46,Picture quality is great much better than the DVD worth the money. It was like watching it live in high definition.
4,Great but............,Game video was exactly what I expected - I was used to the abreviated format from the Road to XLII. I loved seeing all the playoff games in addition to the Superbowl but also would have liked to see the last two games of the season (vs. Jets and Cowboys) which were key to the Giants playoff run.
3,NO NFC EAST TITLE GAME?,"""The Road to Super Bowl XLII"" included the Week 17 loss to the Patriots. How many times are you going to watch that one? So why would ""The Road to Super Bowl XLVI"" not include the Week 17 game against Dallas for the NFC East title? And if they really wanted to do it right, they would have included the Week 16 game against the Jets as it was an elimination game. No need to pay full price for this set. I'll wait for a used copy."
3,Disappointing picture quality on DVD's,"Picture quality is noticeably below HD broadcast quality- I regret not paying extra for the Bluray version.My other grievance is minor- the final score is on the main menu screen- we know who wins the games obviously, but for those that don't have the scores memorized, it'd be more fun to have that little bit of rediscovery."
2,No Jets or Cowboys games?,"I agree with other posts - the Jets game could be included, the Cowboys game SHOULD be included. At that point, every game was a must win ""playoff"". Really surprised to hear these games won't be included - let's hope they reconsider. I'd even spring for a ""Deluxe"" edition that included the Jets and Cowboys games"
1,MAJOR FAIL BY NFL FLIMS,"I'm a DIE HARD NY Giants fan and this set I couldn't wait to be released. However, having this set only contain the playoff games is an EPIC FAIL! The Giants had to win the last two games of the season. This run began with the 99 yard catch and run by Victor Cruz against the Jets. Then a do or die sunday night match up against the cowboys for the NFC East title. How both of those games are not included in this set is ridiculous. I'm sure someone will end up picking this up for me but I'm not spending my money on this set!"
3,Lifted Up by Angels,"I'm probably the only person to rate this book under four stars, but it just wasn't up to Lurlene Mc Daniel's usual standard. Most of the book focuses around Leah and Ethan's romance and the sudden sad ending just seems contrived. I found it almost boring in places. The third and final book of this trilogy is better, but Angels Watching Over Me is definetly the best and also unluckily the shortest. This trilogy could easily have been just two books, taking just a little from this book to lengthen the first,which seemed to end far too fast. if you liked the first book, prepare for a disappointment."
4,Lifted Up by Angels,"Such a great book. This book tells you how love sometimes makes youact. How if people or teenagers fall in love would do each other. Ifyou love a great story with love and sadness added in it, this is the book for you! END"
1,"Guess what, someone dies!","This book was horribele, extremely predictable, and borring!!! Wow, someone dies again, what a surprise! If your going to be reading her books you should know that someone dies in almost everyone of them. The book was so bad and trashily written also. Stuped details were put in and two-year-old language was used. I personaly think that Ms. McDaniel has a problem with death because that is all she writes about. All of the books are the same!!! DO NOT READ THEM"
5,I loved it!!,"I think the book was very good!! I think that Ethan and Leah make a very good couple. Only, I think that Ethans dad was just a little harsh even for his reasons!! I think that they should stay together."
4,world encyclopedia of tanks,this was a great purchase just for the pictures alone. not to much detail on tanks but has some tanks i was unfamiliar with. definetly should be added to any military history library
3,"Great Clamp, BUT THE SHIPPING","Great Clamp - using them for boatbuilding. Well made, and an advantage that they don't rust or lose their paint like the Jet and other painted clamps. Need 20 more, but for $40 worth of clamps, they would charge over $90 for shipping. Headed to home depot now."
2,"Pretty, but not necessary.","I purchased this deck and theSavage Worlds Explorers Edition (S2P10010)at the same time, in preparation to play in a friend's campaign. Being unfamiliar with the SW system, I was under the impression that this specific deck was required for game play, possibly having text and rules for game use. I was wrong, through no fault of the cards or SW, which is a great system. They are pretty to look at, with interesting character illustrations ,but their large size makes them a bit hard to shuffle and deal. As much as I enjoy supporting the game industry with my dollar, in hindsight, I could have just bought a deck of dollar-store playing cards and been fine. I ended up giving them to my GM anyways, and he was happy, so, there you go."
3,Cheap and holds things together,"Its a c clamp. Its not the nicest one, the threads are a bit sticky, but it works. I ordered quite a few of these- amazon shipped each one in its own 8x10"" box! What a waste! I'll get them local next time."
1,Thump AT-8 800,Is it Really 800 watts Dual SubWoofers? or is it a 800 watt subwoofer box enclosure?Please explain would like to know.
1,This is not what I expected,"This item is not what I was expecting ,it 's so small and can't even take the power of my 2000 watts amplifier,if there's anyway I can return it for bigger one that will take 2000 watts,please let me know and I will be glade to do that.even if I 'll'd add more money,I willThanks in appreciation."
1,Way too small,DONT BE FOOLED I wouldn't even call these subwoofers they are so small I laughed my a** off when I got them please don't waste your money unless your not wanting anything powerful just something to add a little bass and emphasis on the little then don't buy these
4,Thump Sub Woofer with Tweeters,"This one certainly saves space(if space is your main concern). My car(Dodge Stealth) has little trunk to spare anything so this box comes handy. It has some sort of deep bass but does not have a punch to it. If you are looking just a bass to add to your stereo, this will definitely do the job.I hook it up to my 1000 Watts Amp and 50x4 Power Acoustic DVD/Stereo and it sounds great. I like it. Note: all Sub-woofer with a type of Tweeters on it won't create a punch...If looking a punchy bass, don't get this one."
4,Good but Can Be improved,"This product at first sounded really distorted and i felt embarrassed showing anyone that i had these subs hooked up in my 4Runner. Then i realized why they sounded so bad. The ""ported"" enclosure did not have enough cubic volume to actually be made ported. I sealed the port holes up with 3/4 MDF and although it may look funny it actually sounds great and hits hard!"
2,Not 18/10,"Although The flatware is nice looking... I bought these because they claimed it was 18/10 stainless steel, what I received was 18/0. Be aware."
2,"Nice, but not as advertised...","Like the other reviewer, I ordered these and was disappointed to find they are not 18/10. Nice looking set, but not the quality I expected."
4,Good product,"Been using the product for three months. No complaints from a 23 yr old living with his best friend (22) and younger brother (20) so you know we put these silverware pieces thru hell and back. I'd order them again, and again!"
3,not impressed,"I too would agree that this did not at all seem like a christian film. It swore, used the Lord's name in vain, and even included a sexual crime in it. Not a christian film. I had let my kids watch thinking it would be appropriate. big mistake. Also the ending left me hanging and not at all satisfied with the ""explanation"""
3,Movie subtitle,The movie is a great movie. Problem was that the subtitle trailed after the scene. Confusing when you are reading while listening to a dialogue that did not match.
2,did not like the last few minutes,The movie was okay for a cold winter afternoon when you cannot get out and do anything outside. The whole movie is dedicated to whether Daniel is or is not her father. We get some information from a paternity test. Then he says something in a bar. And finally Daniel says something else toward the end. I think I understand what he said but I would not bet on it. Could have been made clearer.
2,Disappointing and Poorly Made,"The acting, script, and production quality of this movie are mediocre at best. I also didn't like the fact that the movie contains profanity, which I wasn't expecting in a movie that's supposed to be a family friendly movie. Plus, the plot falls apart in a couple spots. Just not a very good movie."
3,Just so-so,"Ace of Base does a good job with their remake of Bananarama's 80's hit ""Cruel Summer."" Many of the songs on this CD are very reminiscient of ABBA and have a very 70's feel to them. This CD is definitely not their best, but it is a good CD that I would recommend if you are in the mood for some mindless fun."
3,It is a Cruel Joke,"Flowers is another masterpiece by one of the best pop group ever. Arista, AOB's recording company in the US, amazingly found a way to release an awful version of Flowers in the US. They should have called it Cruel Joke, rather than Cruel Summer. The album is missing a few songs from the original version, and many songs are much weaker remakes. It seems like Arista is doing everything possible to doom AOB's success in the US. You should definitely buy European versions of AOB cds."
5,"this is great, Flowers is even better!","the only way Ace of Base could top the american releas is with the euro-beat of Flowers...it spins real tight!Ace of Base never disapoints. play an Ace of Base song, and the crowd goes wild! i spin at the Pump House, so I should know.I'd advice you to get this kickin' record!"
3,"Not bad CD, but there's a better edition.","This album isn't bad at all, but I recomend ""Flowers"", which is the European edition of ""Cruel summer"". Flowers has a better version of Cruel summer and Travel to romantis. Don't buy this one, buy Flowers."
2,Not Bad,"Sorry to say that it wasnt as good as the other AoB Cd's. It was a disappointment for me. I hope they get another CD, before their popularity goes down the drain.. go aob!!"
3,I was expecting more......,This CD is not what I expected it to be. I was hoping for a lot more. Don't get me wrong. I love Ace of Base. They're some catchy songs on here like Cruel Summer but it's just not something I could listen to a lot. After a few listens some of the songs get older a lot faster than some of their older work.
1,Disappointment,"I think they never released anything as good as their first Cd (""happy nation"" european version). This one is not even mediocre. The only song that cathced me was ""life is a flower"" (which is ""whenever you near me"" in american version). BOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!"
1,They're Old News.,"Honestly, since Ace of Base started I have hated their music. I don't understand how they got a lable.. I took my chances and listened to the CD, and didn't like it one bit of a bit.. Save your money and go buy Britney Spears or Ricky Martin- or something.."
2,"Well, What Can I Say?","Well what can I say? I'm really sorry to say that ""Cruel Summer"" is a dissapointing album. I only really like 2 songs, Cruel Summer and Whenever Your Near Me. It seems, Ace Of Base has really gone down ever since the flop of their second album The Bridge."
2,pretty much a disappointment...,"the first two albums they came out with were excellent!!! so i thought i'd just buy the third one w/out even listening to it first (thats what i did with the second one, and i thought it was great) but the third one was a total bummer, none of the songs on it had catchy tunes...at all. it really disappointed me. all i can say is dont waste your money on this album, buy the first and second ones..i garantee you, you will not regret it!!! :)"
2,Almost intolerable,"I was a huge Ace of Base fan back in the day. I remember loving both 'The Sign' and 'The Bridge' and listening to them all the time when I was about 10 or 11. Recently, wanting to feel nostalgic, I got copies of 'The Sign' and 'The Bridge' as well as 'Cruel Summer'. I'd never listened to the the third album, besides the title track. Listening to 'The Sign' and 'The Bridge' again proved to be a great experience, not only because of the nostalgia but because they were still pretty good albums in my mind, even after not hearing them in about a decade. Cruel Summer, on the other hand, is horrid.The overall theme of this album is very disco, and sometimes even has a doo wop feel (a very caucasian-sounding doo wop, mind you). The album has spots that are more dance-y and poppy and are not too terrible, but they are still pretty drab. This album was very disappointing to me."
3,This is not that great...,"Cruel Summer is a good CD for those who just wanna listen to some AoB-music, but more serious fans should go for the European version, titled Flowers, because it has some great songs that are not included on Cruel Summer. Take out a few extra dollars and get Flowers! I bought Flowers and I didn't regret it, and you won't either."
3,Not the best...,I think that this CD is not the best they have made. It is just not the bouncy poppy stuff they used to write. I only liked some of the songs. It was no that good. The verion of every time it rains is way better on the greatest hits album.
5,One of the best CD's!,I am a fabulous fan of Ace of Base. I adored this CD! This album is definatly different than their past ones! I highly recommend it!
4,"ACE OF BASE-CRUEL SUMMER, 1998 ARISTA RECORDS","""Cruel Summer"" the smash hit theme of 1998's summer, peaking at a whoppinh No.10 on Billboard' Hot 100, after a 3 year, no record break. The song ""Cruel Summer"" is a remake of a popular 1980's all-girl group from England, Bananarama, whom's version peaked at No.17, in Canada. Their follow-up, Whenever You're Near Me, is a remake of their own Euro-smash single, Life Is A Flower. Other highlights on this album include: Everytime It Rains, their next single to be released in America. Don't Go Away, a nice songm which I could see as being released as a single. Always Have, Always Will, their current hit in England, & Travel To Romantis, their current Euro-smash. Linn steps down from lead vocalist, and let's Jenny sing her heart out, WOW! Jenny's beauty and talent is unbelieveaable, same as Linn's shouldn't there be a rule against that?"
5,Ace of Base Rules!!!!,"How do you follow up two albums that I enjoyed?? With a third, of course.This cd is so incredible, every song fills with different emotions and reactions. Cecilia is awesome and really enjoy the bonus Cruel Summer track. At first, I was disappointed because how can a group redo this Bananrama song; but, they did it quite nicely and I actually am liking it more than the original. I also love Toyko Girl and Travlin to Romantis...this is the rockin' cd of the season."
2,Very disappointing,"This CD was very very disappointing. I loved their first two CD's, but when I bought this one without listening to it first, I immediately thought of a hundred things I should have done with my $13. The songs just weren't very good. I noticed that they didn't write some of the songs on this CD. They shouldn't try to sing other people's music. It just didn't work. They should definitely stay away from ballads. There were only about two or three decent songs, and I honestly tried to listen to this CD a few times, hoping that it would catch on, but it didn't.What happened to the blond chick? I noticed she was fuzzed out in all the pictures. Just wondering."
5,This is Their Best CD!,"This CD Is really not what you would expect from Ace of Base. Living in Europe and now owning bother versions of the album, I can see how they have adapted it for the US Market. Everytime it Rains is a beautiful 5 minutes of music, very deep song with a lot of meaning. I also like Whenever You're Near Me, which has re-written words form the hit in Europe, Life is A Flower. Also a few songs on this album are different to the versions on the European release, but I urge all Ace of Base fans to get hold of this album. It is never out of my CD Player at the moment and won't be for some months."
5,The songs are inprinted into my head!!!,The CD is realy worth the price you may havet to pay. The songs on it are so good that you will listin to them over and over again and youl never get sick of them. Highly recomend it!!!
1,Why destroy music!,"I regret having purchased this album on the grounds that this particular release has been so chopped up and tampered with that I feel that I'm not getting the true output of my favorite group. Some really fine songs have been excluded here evident from the European version of this album, FLOWERS. On what basis is this decided and by whom?Why the hell do this in the first place?"
5,"""Christian"" music that's actually Christian?","In an industry filled with bands spewing ""positive role model rock"" and where you can listen to an entire album without ever discerning a Chrsitian worldview, this album succeeds where so many fail: it is challenging musically as well as lyrically. Solid song writing balanced with honest lyrics filled with Scripture references and allusions. If you're tired of CCM acts simply rehashing last year's ""secular"" fads or hiding their faith to try and make it big, this is the album for you. Even several years later it is still challenging."
4,"Good, not great","This certainly is not Midnight Oil's best album, but perhaps it pales only because of close exposure to the brilliance that preceded it: ""Diesel and Dust."" Sound is too slick and ""digital"" but there are some outstanding songs here. ""Blue Sky Mine,"" ""Forgotten Years,"" ""Stars of Warburton"" all spectacular. Get it, don't worship it."
1,Not what I expected,"This audio CD was not ""Blue Sky Mining"" as shown, it was a CD with only two songs on it, with Blue Sky Mine being one of the songs.The cover was completely different from what was shown."
3,"Okay, but I like Diesel and Dust and Earth and Sun and Moon better",Diesel and Dust and Earth and Sun and Moon are better. I listen to those two more often. This one is still worth having for a change of pace when listening to them (Midnight Oil) though.
2,Rather detached gloomy music,"I really don't have a favorite on here. It's a nice slice of 90's Folk-Rock, but let's face it I get tired of political rock after awhile. I mean it's good to have if we plan on making changes for the better, and sticking to it. I believe Midnight Oil has struck a nerve here, but it's not conveyed too well."
4,Great stuff,"It's often tempting to purchase a ""best of"" but this doesn't always work. Midnight Oil is a case in point. With many artists: Beatles, Pink Floyd, etc. an arbitrary sampling of various albums leaves one without a real feel for that artist's musical style at the time. Imagine ""Dark Side of the Moon"" or ""Abbey Road"" all chopped to pieces on some greatest hits CD and you get my drift. Blue Sky Mining is a keeper because it really captures the band at their musical and (as always) political best. Everyone knows the hits, but, speaking of the Beatles, my favorite is Stars of Warburton: sort of a Television meets Revolver. I'd give it 5 stars but a couple songs aren't for me; that said, it's still a better sampling of Midnight Oil than any greatest hits collection I've heard and certainly one of their strongest efforts. If you like the band, get this CD"
4,To Petar Vodogaz,"Petar, ""10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 "" was not Midnight Oil's debut album, that would be 1978's ""Midnight Oil""."
5,MacBook Pro Battery Exchange Program,"I have had this machine since March. It always ran hot so much that you had to cover your legs when using it. The battery began to give me real trouble at the same time Apple announced its battery exchange program. Once I figured out how to read the battery serial number(I had to remove it and blow it up via the copier by 200%!) and even then it took me a while to figure out the final four characters, I called Apple, was told to use the web site, entered the info at about 3:00P.M. and received the replacement battery the next day by 1:00P.M. Called DHL at 1:30P.M. to pick up the old one and they were there by 3:30P.M. to return it to Apple. Excellent response and I wonder if Bill and his buddies would even consider matching that. Oh, by the way, the machine ain't bad either."
5,Paraffin Therapy,"Heats up very slowly which makes it impractical for the casual user. Hot wax is clever gimmmick. I think water works just as well. This product is well made. It perfoms as it should and is sized for big feet(I have size 12). If you are convinced that you need wax on your feet and you have a lot of time to use the product, I recommend it."
4,Wonderfully odd tales from the same city,"The best way to read this book is to know nothing about it beforehand. Maupin has crafted a creepily odd and seductive psychological mystery that needs to tap into your sense of innocence and surprise; it is what you must bring to the read. At more than one point I was caught up with the ""Wow!"" of the plot. Maupin manages to mix the inventive and the autobiographical in a way that lends resonance to both elements, and if his emotional nakedness does not unsettle you, the strangeness of the story will pull you in."
5,just perfect,"I cannot come close to describing how much I loved this book. Having thoroughly enjoyed the series ""Tales of the City,"" I was very eager to read more of Maupin. Let me assure you I wasn't let down for a minute.This book tells the story of Gabriel Noone and his search for meaning in the midst of a break up with his partner and reaching his mid fifties. Without giving to much away, the story takes us on a journey into what Gabriel needs and wants in his life, whether real or a dream. The longing, pain and love that is felt in each word had me openly weeping at times, laughing out loud and cursing the characters.Like all good things the story comes to its only conclusion, but like a diner of Chinese food, when your done your totally satisfied; fifteen minutes later your wanting more. I am still wanting and missing Gabriel and his life and dreams."
3,"Welcome Back, Mr. Maupin!","Althought ""The Night Listener"" is not Armmistead Maupin's best work, it is still an enetertaining novel. Maybe I am biased because I am so happy to see and read a new Maupin novel. (The nod to ""Tales of the City"" in this book was a nice welcomed touch) The entire time I read this novel I couldn't see or think of anyone else but Armistead as Gabriel Noone. My problems with the novel are legit-the novel gives a few twists but not enough turns as a successful mystery. I recommend to all readers to read the beginning of the novel again when you finsih to get a true sense of the circular motion of the book. All and all Armistead never fails to grab the reader with with his words that can capture a feeling, a mood or atmposphere-brillantly!"
2,big let down,"The book had a fast paced momentum throughout that concluded with...nothing but a big let down! I am aware that the story was told from a true occurence, however this does not mean the story is worth retelling. I am very shocked at all the good praise for this novel. Do yourself a favor and do not read this book. It will leave you left wanting more of something that will never deliver."
2,maudlin maupin,I was looking forward to Maupin's new book enough to shell out the $$ for the hardcover instead of waiting for the paperback. Big mistake. Read his earlier works and go to the library for this one. Two stars because l. i finished it 2. rare flashes of his usual wit and observations.
2,disappointing...found myself skipping to the end...,"Since I have read all his other books, I was greatly disappointed in this one.. Started off great and I couldn't wait to the next time I had a chance to read some more and then it went flat... confusion about the truth of the boy's identy..really lost a great chance to deal with the boys story. Hope the next one is better..I certainly will wait for the paperback and not buy the hardcopy."
2,The Night Listener,"I really didn't get what the rave reviews were about. Never read Maupin's books and probably never will again if this book is typical of his writing. I found it a mundane, self-indulgent rant describing in all-too-great-length the main character's personal hurt of losing his lover and his all-too-improbable relationship with a young boy. I never got a sense of why these two characters would ever have enough in common to become friends. I skipped through most of the trite, trying conversations between the main character and his father, his accountant and most of all the thirteen year old boy. I did like the story of the jeweled elephant though."
3,About what you'd expect,"Yes, it's a page turner. And a guilty pleasure. If you liked ""The Magician's Tale,"" you'll like this too. But don't expect anything especially profound. Maupin passes up the opportunity to reflect on the culture of voyeurism and Kinderfeindlichkeit that provides his story's context and makes his story ""work."" San Francisco quirkiness is also conspicuously absent; gay protagonists might as well be proud citizens of Charlotte, North Carolina."
3,Just Not Sure,"I don't know. I love Maupins books, Tales etc and Maybe the Moon, but I can't decide about this one. I found the beginning slow, the last two thirds so fantastic I was late for work and constantly tired, and then the last couple of pages...odd. Bizare. (His PA being Anna from the Tales made me giggle though!!) If you're a Maupin fan - give it a go. If you're not and your expectations weren't as stupidly high as mine - go for it cos on its own its an excellent book - I think because I waited so long for it I was under welmed."
2,A big disappointment after a long wait,"Okay, so I didn't expect him to return to the folks at Barbary Lane (but it would have been great). I just wasn't ready for this thinly disguished memoir and mess of an unsolved mystery. The author was not ready for his close-up Mr. DeMille! His sycophantic friends and ex-lovers should have told him to write a memoir (or a diary it seems), or write real fiction with an original mystery. I am sad and sorry to pan this book as I will always love Armistead Maupin for the pleasure he gave me in the series. Go back to storytelling please."
1,Pathetic,"Not only was Gabriel exceedingly boring, repetitive and pathetic I never CARED about his character. MaupinsI kept thinking, ok yes I already know this about this or that character why do I need to be told again. Get on with it. When I read the end of this book I wanted to throw the book out the window! The book had a good premise but it got lost in the muddle."
2,What's it all about?,"I loved all of Maupin's previous books. This I can'tmake sense of. I have no idea what he is writing about.Unfortunately, it cost me $14.00 to find out. Oh, well."
1,REALLY?,"I am a hetero, married ,middle-aged female, who has never read one of Mr. Maupin's books. Being an adoptive mom, the description on the back caught my attention. I have to say that his constant reference to homosexual acts and behaviors turned me off the book and I didn't get past the first 1/4 of the book before I put it down and didn't pick it up again. so much for judging a book by its cover."
1,I feel dirty now,"This book is about a writer who splits up with his long-term boyfriend, becomes depressed, and then becomes friends with a young boy (I think 10? 12? I don't remember) over the phone who was abused and used in a kiddy porn ring by his parents before escaping only to learn he had AIDs and writing a book on it. Except as the book goes on, it becomes questionable whether the kid actually exists.All well and good, but what really makes the book stand out isn't the storyline. Noooo. It's the slashy overtones where there REALLY REALLY SQUICKILY SHOULDN'T BE ANY! I should NOT get the idea that this abused kid is this middle-aged author's fantasy. No, no, NO.I felt dirty after reading this. I felt even more dirty after finding out via wikipedia that the author based it on a real life experience of it.This is a scary scary man, and makes me want a long long bath."
3,lots of unanswered questions,"Armistead Maupin is among my favorite writers, and if you enjoy his style and his wry take on the world, tis book is worth reading.But I have to say, I couldn't accept the mystery at the core of the story. I MUST have missed something -- and I hope someone will tel me if I did -- but as soon as Gabe met Pete and the questions began about Pete's identity, I thought: This story could hardly have gone unnoticed by the newspapers. Even if Pete testified in camera, *somebody* would have seen him. How could this possibly be a mystery?With that nagging at me, I couldn't enjoy the book fully. The writing, yes. The plot, no."
4,Stop Looking for a Concrete Resolution,"I finished The Night Listener yesterday and believe it to be a very good read. I am perplexed by some reviewers' desire for things to be neatly wrapped up and to have the mystery solved.PLEASE! This novel is about a journey and how some things simply do not end, but change and evolve. Relax and let yourself change and evolve as well. Pick up the book and share Maupin's journey. Hopefully this won't sound too cliche, but you will laugh and cry."
4,"A Fast, Fun, Revealing Read","This is Maupin's first work in years, and while it's hard not to suspect autobiographical undercurrents - or surface currents, really - this does not distract from the overall result. If you are a Maupin fan, you already own it - but if you don't, you should. If you haven't read Maupin before, this is an excellent choice for a start (although, Tales of the City is the classic choice).Maupin keeps the story moving nicely, while keeping the daily, human events in the story. Many of his asides ground the story in a reality that anyone from the Bay Area would recognize. His relationships between the characters are both simple and complex, unlikely and relistic ... dichotomous.I haven't laughed with Maupin like this for a few books now. Let us hope he continues writing at this level or better."
4,"A different Maupin, but intriguing","I discovered Maupin by accident and thoroughly enjoy his writing. The Tales books are a joy and I have always been puzzled that they are relegated to ""lesbian studies"" rather than simple fiction where anyone might find and enjoy his work. This book, however, is very specifically and clearly about a gay character, rather than a mix of generally facinating out-of-the-mainstream characters. Some of the details about the gay lifestyle made me uncomfortable, but the story was an interesting one that I enjoyed. It did seem a little drawn out by the end, but it was so well written, I kept going anyway. I am a devoted Maupin reader. Although this lacked some of the flavor I enjoyed in earlier works, I found new things to enjoy. I could have done without some of the sexual details, but it was a minor annoyance overcome by a facinating story. I'll be waiting with anticipation for the next novel."
4,love it!!!!!!!!!,"this is such a great book! i was moved and bewildered by the story. in fact, i had to reread it to get some further understanding, i will most likely read it over and over again. its that good! i had to go out and get a few of maupins other books, which are wonderful as well."
4,Riveting and memorable,"I only bought this book as I couldn't find anything else of interest before going on a long flight and having loved the Tales of the City series decided to give this a try. Needless to say I didn't get any sleep on that trip until I'd turned the last page. It was a riveting read and I really enjoyed it. It will also stay with me for a long time, especially the part where Jess first speaks to Pete and what he suspects (don't want to spoil the surprise). The only problems I had with it were the constant similarities with Maupin's own life and the ambiguity of the ending. Call me old fashioned, but it just turned a bit wishy-washy at the end. Nevertheless, a great book, and should be read by a huge audience."
2,Perhaps his other works are better...,"I can't deny that The Night Listener is engaging and easy to relate to. What I liked most is the way Gabriel describes the pain of losing a lover and falling into a depression. It's not easy to stick to him, but Maupin's depiction of the loss is very accurate. However, the whole story about Pete and his relationship with Gabriel is unrealistic and creepy. We virtually cannot see the emotional scars that Pete carries due to his years of suffering. Perhaps the writer has tried to give us a clue, after all, we never know if Pete is really himself. But the fact that after a few phone calls, Gabriel and Pete are calling themselves father and son, made me feel very uneasy. Also, the subplot involving Gabriel and his father is cliched and boring."
2,"Not believable, except in parts","I found this book to be a fun read, but it's not a ""masterpiece"" or a ""triumph."" Even by Maupin's ""Tale of the City"" standards, this is a strangely unsatisfying novel. I thought the storyline itself was confusing and did not really lead much of anywhere. I was fascinated with this book more as a document of Maupin's self-indulgence than as an act of fictional creativity.I would have liked to see a novel that spent more time with Noone's breakup with his long-time lover, Jess. The dynamics of Noone's heartbreak in the context of seeing a lover move from almost certain death to a completely different plane are handled wonderfully, but it would have been preferable to see this story moved to the forefront and the hokey 13-year-old-as-counselor gimmick moved to the background. The novel that Maupin really should have written, unfortunately, is not what we get."
1,"a weak story, poorly told","Maupin, with his ""Tales of the City"" series and ""Maybe the Moon,"" established himself as a storyteller of high order. That makes this current book an even greater disappointment. A book that cannot decide what it wants to be, it is full of one-dimensional or incomprehensible characters that move around within the rambling plot without reason or cause or much to like about them. The plot ""twists"" are mostly unnecessary or inane, and one is left feeling that Maupin owes us a refund or a real book."
3,Intriguing Story but lacks any unexpected turns,"The overall story and concept of this book was very interesting but as a whole lacked some depth and real character as a whole. The characters were loosey based on real people in the author's life, but I just feel like he didn't mold them into anything that was all the interesting. IN short, the book has turned me off to the idea of watching the movie, but I don't regret the time I spent going through it. Accept for the graphic gay love scenes...I'm not against people living their lives the way they please, but just with I had some warning for some of the descriptions of what went on."
1,Yikes,"This is one of the worst books by a real writer I have ever read. Of course, there are books by people who really can not write and their books are simply unreadable. And there are books by accomplished authors who just dialed it in to meet a deadline. Then there is this mess. The entire storyline involving Pete was simply ridiculous -- there are absolutely NO PUBLIC RECORDS, NO PUBLICITY of the criminal conviction of child porn parents! Every element was contrived -- dialogue, relationships, plot. Yikes."
5,Beautiful book and a great reminder how inspirational Haanel is as a writer,"I usually judge a book by how many quotes I underline in a book. This book has too many to count and it was a true pleasure to read on my kindle. This is the type of book you can keep going back to for years and learn something new every time you open it up. Wisdom, relevance and uplifting, this book is well worth your time."
5,Rollins Band did not disappoint,"Nor did I expect them to. They've never let me down before. This is music to get into. Rollins Band has a sound and feel so rare that too many bands are unlistenable. This is a record to put on and turn up the stereo. Pick this one up if you like rock and roll. By the way, don't skip around on this cd...you'll get lost and lose so much."
1,Ripped off again,"Rollins once said he wouldn't stick around to get boring like all his heroes. Well, he did. He also said about 5 years ago that he would retire from music completly in a couple of years. If only.After the disastrous Come in and Burn, the lacklustre Get some go again, comes this profoundly weak effort. I have now bought 3 Rollins album that I will play very rarely. If only he had retired after Weight instead of allowing us to see his rapid and sorry decline into bloated corporate rock."
4,Cool,"This album rocks, its nice to see Rollins out there trying again.Not his best work of all time, but the world is a better place with new music from Henry and the gang occasionally. Check out the track, Your Number is One. Also, some more ""funky"" and jazzy aspects on this record. Though it does feel rushed at times (in terms of putting it together)."
4,"Nice album, Henry!","I just picked up this cd & have listened to it a couple of times already. Pretty heavy duty rock & roll from the Rollins Band. Definitely worthy of purchase! If you like the rock music, Hank & the boys rarely disappoint!"
5,San Jose Silicon Valley Book Correction,"This really isn't a review, just a note to let you know that I, Dana L. Grover, am the featured photographer for the new ""San Jose Silicon Valley: Innovative Vision, Entrepreneurial Spirit"" book, not one of the editors. If you would like to correct that on your on-line information, I wouldn't mind a bit.Oh, it's a pretty good book, too. Especially the photos!"
4,Great Live,I saw these dudes live in concert and they rocked the house. Get the CD now and don't ask questions.
2,it gets old,"i heard c.t.c. and i thought 'this is awesome!' so i went to the store and bought it. when i brought it home i realized it wasn't what i thought it would be. 'c.t.c.' is by far the best song, and 'lonely guy' is a very convincing james brown impression, but other then that, they all start to sound the same."
4,Blood Heroine,"Although this is not the last word in modern drama, the play included in this book is quite interesting. I am a theatre director interested in Grand Guignol Dramas and, even though I did not LOVE the play, it is most certainly a great excercise for actors, as well as for directors, since the play presents a very intriguing character. It is a ruthless character, yet the audience must love her dearly. It's a very fine line to work there, therefore a great challenge. It's strange, the poems and specially the play affected me in a peculiar way: I was not cray about the text, but it was intriguing and challenging. I guess the best way to know it is to stage it and see what comes out. For theatre lovers it is a very peculair reading. Join the Blood Countess crusade if you dare!"
5,Must read for any serious business person,"Jeffrey Williams takes an new approach to analyzing competitive forces based on the new concept of economic time. This allows insight into how to manage and compete within different industries, or, within different divisions of a company. I found the insights to be unique, and extraordinarily valuable to me as an entrepreneur in the high tech industry."
4,Penguin,"This is a wonderful conversation piece. It works as stated, and is really fun to use. Very good to look at as well. Gave it as a gift to a person who collects penguin items and found this to be one of the most unique in the collection."
1,Bought two - neither worked,No instructions were included; must be so simple they aren't needed!Well we couldn't get it to work and the person who received the other one couldn't get it to work either.They are both in the garbage now. A total waste.
5,an inspiring album,"This is an important album as it documents a segment of sample-based music that should take a space in music history alongside the politically and socially relevant compositions of Public Enemy and KRS-ONE. In the early 90s, when most so-called ""alternative"" and ""punk"" music had dozed off into an apolitical stupor, Consolidated was one of the most intriguing bands. They invited debate with live audiences and passed mics around -- probably the only real innovation in live rock in decades. Their political focus was well-documented. But most often overlooked by the squeamish white press was the fact that the instrumental aspect of Consolidated's music is accomplished and exhilarating. In their heyday, no one was indifferent to Consolidated. With the latest Bush administration, their early 90s music has, sadly, become equally relevant in 2002."
3,Play Less Audience.,"Ah, Consolidated. Difficult to find a more ernest bunch of gigaPC ""rappers."" I agree with their message and enjoy their music, but history has left them hanging. I now find listening to their albums provokes some humor at their oh-so-serious attempt to make their audience do something other than buy CD's.This album has too many tracks of the audience complaining to listen to straight through. It is a good evidence of the necessity of programmable CD players - or mix tapes. ""Tool And Die"" and ""Infomodities '92"" are fine industrial rap, but the real reason for this disk of shiny plastic is ""You Suck."" Technically, it's not even Consolidated - it's credited to ""The Yeastie Girls."" Never before has there been a better sex-positive song... Admittedly, a small segment of recorded music, but my hat is off to you. Bravo."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"Gospel Blues is my favorite music genre, and I consider Reverend Gary Davis to be the godfather. However these supposed sessions made at the Apostolic Studio are not his best, despite the glowing review in the liner notes. Many of the songs should be classified as outtakes, with the reverend coughing or talking in the background. I was hoping to get some of his better gospel songs, but Harlem Street Singer is a better choice than this. There is some good harmonica work here, but it not enough to call this quality work."
3,Not AP material,"If you are taking Physics B, buy a Physics B book. If you are taking the C test, buy a C book. But please, don't rely on this book to study. This book does not qualify as a study guide. The questions are way too easy compared with actual AP questions, and though the explanations are clear, the material does not go deep enough into the subject. Especially the section on Fluids. The B test goes A LOT more into detail.It is only good as a starter. Do the book before starting the course, that way you will have a fair idea of what the topics are about. The book is very readable and fairly easy to understand. But please, don't use it as a study guide."
3,not real great,"Dont get me wrong, these guys are musically talented. It's just that all of their music sounds the same, and the same as everybody else. They dont have a real diffenent sound, and their songs are kinda hard to get into. Still not a bad CD though if you're into the really mellow stuff."
2,"""Our Daily Walk"" (D02) Christian Focus Publications # ISBN 1 85792 048 1, published ""93"" reprined 98 & 02","Not a ""highly"" educated individual, but if you decide to read this make sure you have a dictionary along side you.Not sure, but could this author enjoy hearing himself, too wordy!This publication did not receive accurate proof reading. All ""Z's"" are S's to start, beyond this there are many, many more errors throughout.Each year my wife and I choose a new daily reading book. There were times that we simply wanted to give up reading and reread another instead.Cheetah"
4,lens cap,good coverdon't drop it too many times or the insides will come apart. good cover despite this
5,I like this for some strange reason,"I remember hearing this song late at night on my car radio a few years ago. I liked its dreamy, smooth and romantic qualities.The structure of the song is a little unusual and it features synthesizers and a piano - used in a very beguiling way. Donna Lewis has a very light and attractive voice. I am not sure if she has done very much since this song was released.Nice to hear this one from time to time!"
4,Excellent CD--even better live!!,"The first time I heard of this band was when they opened for Sting on his ""Ten Summoner's Tales"" tour back in '93. All I can say is ""WOW""!! I am a huge Sting fan but I was so impressed with Dada that instead of buying Sting's CD, I went to the music store the next day and bought ""Puzzle"". What a great CD! With one or two exceptions, I love every song--especially ""Dorina"" for its excellent guitar work, and ""Moon"" for its emotion. I would highly recommend this CD to anybody, but if you want to know how good Dada really is, you have to see them live."
1,what do you see in this???,"This has to be one of the most plastic, weird bands i've ever heard. It's Hasslhoff-esque in that I understand how people in Eastern European nations that don't speak english could like it but, my gawd, is this CD bad!! ""Dizz Knee Land"" became a radio hit, i think, because people thought it was meant to be ironic and funny, but after listening to the rest of the album, i'm not so sure. if you're in some group therapy program where you aren't supposed to listen to anything but gloss because it might make you emotional, or you can't get enough Better Than Ezra B-side rejects, then this album is for you."
4,BUY IT!,"DADA is without a doubt the most under-rated band in the history of rocknroll. Hitting their stride at the same time that Grunge Rock was emerging, these journeymen rockers have been ignored except by a small following of loyal fans. Their first two CDs. ""Puzzle"" & ""American Highway Flower"" are clearly their best work. If you like searing guitar solos, tight drumming, and great 3-part harmonies the BUY THIS CD..."
5,Revisited,"I had this album many years ago. Decided to get it again and re fell in love with it. Great tone, songwriting, and skillful playing."
4,"guitar virtuosity, songwriting diversity, and harmonies!","Puzzle is a must-have for anyone interested in strong rock-pop songwriting, blazing yet refined guitar licks, and hummable harmonies. One of the best albums of the 90s; keeps finding its way back into my player."
2,Not too helpful...Sorry,"I got this book based on the description and the reviews written. I found the book to be something easy to just flip through although I tried to read page for page, it was just not too insightful. The stories were good to read, and the checklist/info at the end of each chapter was good. The only thing I did not like was the Bible/Christian perspective of the book. It does not allow all readers to relate to. Some of the suggested advice was to ACCEPT GOD? The author should have atleast indicated where some of the perspective was geared towards. Not every one is Christian, and not every can relate to the bible or a cheating minister as a husband =("
3,Good Book for the Single and Married Gal!,"This is a good book for the single gal who wants to avoid the pain of a wrong relationship and for the married gal who needs to figure out how to survive the pain of a man that is not honoring her because of his wounding. Seller delivered product on time and the price was right!This book has been recommended by counselors. The only thing I did not like is that the chapter on ""The Angry Man"" did not include enough about the verbal abuser...-S"
2,Too Religious!,"I ordered this book because I was interested to read about methods to steer clear of unhealthy relationships, and maybe gain some introspection as to why people choose the partners that they do. What I got instead was a super religious-slanted take on how to choose a partner who is ""Godly."" None of the reviews that I read mentioned anything about this book teaching people how to choose ""Godly"" partners or to date in a Christian-like manner. I felt like I was reading a self-help book on how to become a good Christian, especially given the incessant quotes of Bible scriptures. Nothing at all what the title implies! I skipped over most of the book, and if I could return it, I definitely would."
4,This disc is a 50/50 proposition.,"I'm a huge Bob Hope fan. I have many of his films on tape and DVD. ""My Favorite Brunette"" was always one of my favorite Bob Hope films. I have an old tape version of ""Brunette"" that he personally signed for me many years ago. After reading reviews of how great Morengo Films did with this DVD, I readily bought this disc. I was really excited about the prospect of a ""Brunette"" transfer that would finally be better than the cruddy verison I have on tape or the copy I taped off of The Disney Channel. I can't say how disappointed I was in ""Brunette"" on this DVD. I swear the film must have been run through a dust bowl before it was transferred. My Disney Channel copy was ten times better, so either a better print exists somewhere or Disney spent time and money making their copy much cleaner. Makes me wonder how much worse the other DVD releases are of ""Brunette."" ""Bali"" was just fine on this DVD. Oh well, at least I don't need to rewind a tape."
2,Daniel J. Filice was right,"I bought the DVD on the recommendation of the person who blessed Marengo Films. She must have been in their employ. The print from which my old Goodtimes tape of ""My Favorite Brunette"" was made was much cleaner. It's the one I'll keep."
2,"Good movie, poor conversion to dvd","This is a couple of good movies that document humor from another day and age. However, the production quality of the DVD leaves much to be desired. The audio track seems to be complete but the video track appears to have many holes in it which are filled by showing peices of the movie twice."
3,Just ok,"I bought this vise to re-grip golf clubs mainly. I bolted the vise down and tightened the swivel and everything looked great. However, I noticed that the swivel would not tighten completely. The swivel base still moves about half an inch when tugged in either direction. Besides that the vise works great for holding objects in place. It's definitely for light duty use. I can still use it for re-gripping clubs and sharpening lawn mower blades, but that's about all I use it for. You will need 3/8 bolts, washers and four nuts to install. (about 5 bucks at a hardware store). Hope this review helps."
5,The Blind Watchmaker,"Not an easy book to read, but well worth the effort. Understanding the evidence and arguments for evolution requires effort and thought, whereas believing in invisible and untestable gods is easy, which is why most people choose the latter. Dawkins explains clearly why evolution is the best, indeed the only rational explanation for life as it exists on Earth (other than the FSM, of course. Arrrr!)"
4,Your second primer on evolution.,"His stuff may overlap a bit. The chapter on biomorphs I already read elsewhere. Otherwise this was a very good read, using easy examples and analogies to get across basic aspects of evolution that most people probably aren't aware of."
4,"a skilful presentation, but ...","The arguments in the book are skilfully and persuasively presented, but they are also somewhat superficial. They appear much less convincing in the light of some scholarly critiques which have recently appeared, such as Michael Behe's ""Darwin's Black Box"", or the less well known but more comprehensive and very incisive ""Not By Chance"" by Lee Spetner, ISBN 1-880582-24-4 (Behe presents only one argument - irreducible complexity). Those who are already emotionally committed to darwinism will accept Dawkin's ideas uncritically, but the more objective reader will benefit from reading the two critiques together with ""Blind Watchmaker"". It's more stimulating, more educational and more fun to grapple with the arguments from both sides."
3,Not for dummies!,"Many of the reviewers say how much they gained from this book. I didn't. I took college biology, but this book was way over my head. I skimmed a lot of the book, because the content was way too deep for me. I'm sure Dawkins is a brilliant biology scholar, but this book looks like a phD thesis to me. If you're into coadaptive genotypes, biochemical pathways, and episolon myoglobins, this could be the book for you."
5,the origin of idiots,"...Dawkins never claims his ""biomorphs"" to bebiological, their sole purpose is to show how small changes over aperiod of time can make huge changes in the end product; no more, noless. He turns trees (yes, just the shapes) into grasshoppers, and dragon flies, and satelites (yes, satelites, which are never claimed to be biological). His ""quasi-biological forms"" (see the forms?) do an excellent job of making his point, and you shall never convince this 'skeptic' otherwise."
1,Tribal Science at its best!,"This is a must read for all science fiction buffs! There is no real science in this whole book. It is pure non-sense!A simple question for Dr. Dawkins, who actually believes in spontaneous generation.Sir, ""The Empirical Science of the CELL:""1. All living things are composed of one or more cells.2. The cell is the basic unit of structure and function of all living things.3. Cells only come from other existing cells.Now Dr. Dawkins, please explain me how evolutionism can account for cell theory.Please respond to the following: You need to explain how we get the information system (DNA) and the language system of the DNA code to interpret it..How do you get the first DNA information and how does it increase from the so-called (unproven and imaginary) 'proto-cell' to human?Please explains this using real empirical science!"
2,Science should not be a dogma,The heart of Dawkins argument is fundamentalism. It is dogma. It is narrow mindedness. It is everything science should not be. This book is all about a materialists faith. There is a depth to reality and to the evolutionary story which Dawkins does not approach. Instead the book describes a very shallow perspective. So be it.
2,What of the Humans?,"The evidence of natural selection, variation of the species driven by genetic diversity and the survival of the fittest is irrefutable.But blind chance? Every component of an eco-system, all flora and fauna, both contribute to and are dependent on the eco-system it finds itself in. Except, of course, for humanity.We need as much from our eco-system as any species, yet we contribute nothing. Why would that be?We were put here on purpose. Isn't it obvious?"
4,Crushed the argument from Design,"This book mightily challenges the Argument from Design - attacking the unexamined premise that design implies a Designer. Dawkins shows how exquisitely complex and fine-tuned biological structures arise from non-random moving about in genome space under the discipline of natural selection. Throughout, we have Dawkins fine, clear writing, although at times he does seem to be flogging a dead horse.My favorite by Dawkins is still The Selfish Gene, but this is probably more accessible to the general reader.Warning: if you believe in God because of the Argument from Design, then either your dogma or your intellectual integrity won't survive this book."
3,Okay for beginners but...,"May be an appropriate book for someone who wants to get introduced to Darwinism, or for someone who wants to convince others into the theory of evolution. However, anyone familiarwith the idea should find this rather boring, especially compared with his two phenomenal preceding works"
3,General in Content,"This is a good book for the general public, but for those with a four year degree in Biology or who are well read in the life sciences, it is not particularily stimulating. It does well covering the basics of biological evolution, and it affectively addresses the conventional creationist arguments, but I don't think this book demonstrates in the end what it seeks to establish.I strongly recommend another book by Richard Dawkins, ""The Selfish Gene"", a book which presents a very useful paradigm for viewing the biological world."
3,Don't suppress Spirituality,"After having been engrossed in books about spirituality, purpose and deeper perspectives on reality - books such as ""Living Buddha, Living Christ"" and ""Breath you are Alive"" both by Thich Nhat Hanh, and ""Conversations with God"" by Neale Donald Walsch - I came across the reviews below for the Blind Watchmaker. What a turn around. Bitterness, arguing, denying human spirituality, denying purpose, dogma. Open your eyes. There is more to reality than materialism. There is more to science than Richard Dawkins."
4,"AFTER READING, THINK ABOUT THIS....","So if your like me, you read this book because you are either trying to disprove creationism or looking for a way to mold religious beliefs in God and the facts that science prove.Ive had very few chances to discuss the following idea with hard core Darwinist, but I think it is still a valid comment. I would love to hear from anyone who has refutations to it, please email them to Suprfreaky@hotmail.com. Here is my idea...If you look at the extremes of either argument, you believe that there is absolutly no God and no Creator and that everything is based on pure chance and evolution through science. On the opposite extreme you dont believe anything science has proven, you believe compeltly in what your religion tells you and take the story of Adam and Eve competly literal. How about grey area...God used sciece to create the world which was the only option for things to work."
3,Antiproof,"By the principles Dawkins describes, there was little point in him writing the program atall. By their application it is probable, naysay, definate that at some point in the future, on a computer somewhere, the program will write itself. The key flaw being that although that COULD be construed as supporting evidence; someone somewhere made the computer.3 stars for effort... o_O and because i have to give a rating"
2,Open your minds,"""The Blind Watchmaker"" is a nice bit of propaganda for the so-called open minded materialists. Chaos, complexity, self-organization and the deeper ecology of evolutionary processes are the way forward for evolutionary science. Why isn't any of this covered in Dawkins' book?"
2,"Nice try, but philosophy isn't the same thing as science.","Richard Dawkins has written a brilliantly written, highly informative, and woefully mistaken defense of non-teleological Darwinism. I notice that I am in the minority in giving him a low rating; don't worry, guys, I HAVE read the book! Dawkins does a great job of explication, *assuming* that his ideas of evolutionary continuity and the efficacy of mindless processes to produce organized complexity are correct. However, that is a pretty big assumption. Michael Behe has given some of Dawkins' more egregious examples a badly needed skewering in his new book, _Darwin's Black Box_ (Interestingly enough, many people seem to think that Dawkins has pre-refuted Behe. I find this belief to be unconvincing, as will most people who have *actually read* DBB, as opposed to the unfavorable reviews.) For an intelligent presentation of ""the other side"", I would recommend that fair-minded readers give Behe a hearing"
5,Evolution - watchmaker of life,"Evolution does not attempt to achieve a certain design, or even certain features, but depends largely on the chance of circumstances. The reference to making watches is an answer to William Paley's argument of last century. Paley noted that if we were to find a watch, we could not say that it randomly came together, much like a rock. The complexity of a watch, and the fact that its parts all function together, indicates that it had a designer. The analogy with lifeforms is thus obvious, ie, how could such complex entities come together randomly. The watch must have had a watchmaker, and similarly, life must have also had a designer. Dawkins argues that the watchmaker of life is evolution, ie, a blind process that does not attempt to specifically create any particular design."
4,A good description of how natural selection works,"If you are interested in the idea of creationism and Darwin's theory of evolution, you will probably find this book of interest.In my opinion, Richard Dawkins does an excellent job of countering some of the ideas and beliefs of creationism by describing, in understandable terms, why Darwin's theory of evolution does not require the assumption of a supreme being to explain the incredible complexity and diversity of life on our planet.To me, Dawkins builds his case for Darwin's theory in the same way that evolution itself works: in small incremental steps, showing how extremely complex biological entities, like the human eye, oould have evolved over long periods of time without requiring the assistance of the ""master"" watchmaker postulated by 18th century theologian William Paley.As Dawkins states in the first chapter of his book, the ""watchmaker"" is the process of natural selection itself."
5,A Good Introduction To and Defense of Evolution,"This book is another fine effort by Richard Dawkins to explain how the complexity of life can be explained by evolution including natural selection. He uses his usual detailed, but laymen type of explanation to explore how various attributes of animals (and man) have come about.The books closing chapters deal with some of the other theories that exist to try to explain the diversity of life. He does not take a highbrow approach. He explains the core beliefs and concepts of the theories and then using their own words, shows how they can not explain it as well as the theory of evolution can.I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in a good discussion of evolution. You will not find an atheist arguing here. You will find a scientist who knows his field and wants you to understand it as well."
3,I haven't read the book...but some thoughts,"I used to be an athiest. If one sticks to the definition of a deist, I guess I am still an Athiest. I think I believe in god, albeit a different type of god than what whan usually means when one uses the word. No i don't believe in A big man in the sky, but there is an intelligence to the universe, an intelligence that is present in us, in ""evolution"", in everything. I just realize that I do not have the words to say what I think I may know. I do know that in a way, he is right. There is no watchmaker to the the universe...the universe makes itself. You just have to know how to look."
1,Spoken like a true fundie kid,"Your choices are two: a seeing or blind watchmaker who made up his mind to bring about all that we see. The only doubt is: God or me? If it was I who self-evolved, God is a lie that is absolved from any merit in life's affair. We all inherit: we're God's software.From one kid to another, one fundie to another (fundie Creationists are only outdone by fundie evolutionists): public schools need choice for students and parents to choose, not a monolithic monopoly. I.D. belongs in my classroom I hope before my 14th birthday."
3,Ponderously informative,"I am a true believer in evolution. I am. But this book is very dense and hard to get through. And I understand what he is talking about! Dawkins, while a gifted thinker, is unfortunately not a gifted writer. Perhaps I am too harsh, perhaps it is the material he is trying to explain, but while there are a few flashes of clarity within its pages, overall it is difficult to digest. I kept hoping there was a Cliff's Notes version somewhere that could succintly summarize what he was trying to say. Maybe he could collaborate with a more graceful and engaging scribe to explain things."
1,Why the evidence reveals how he reads the evidence,"Reading this book shows how far some will go with 'just-so' stories and hypothetical 'explanations' that substitute for expositions of what really happened. Having a plausible, Occam's Razor sort of alibi for every miraculous emergence that cannot be rationally explained without CreatorGodWhoCares doesn't make evolution really so; it's 'just so'.The question begging to be answered at book's end is: given that one chooses to believe all we observe arose from evolution, where did evolution itself come from? Dawkins admits evolution evolves, so please tell us why the evidence reveals not Creation ex nihilo, but Creation ex creatio? All the apparent design is blind, dumb, mindless designation imposed coincidentally on our evolved brains to notice that all the apparent design needs a rational explanation or explaining away?Poof! Everything nested solo from scratch?If so, think, Braille, think: there is a catch -Can we deny First Hatcher given hatch?"
1,fundamentally flawed,"For a through examination of the essential phenomena attempted to be explained in this book, read Not by Chance, by Massachusetts Institute of Technology doctorate Lee M. Spetner. By his exhaustive knowledge of Information Theory he fundamentally erodes the foundation of the premise of Dawkins's efforts, as well as the core ""mechanics"" of all mechanistic evolution. Data at the genetic information level cannot and does not arise out of nothing; the mechanism of random mutation, directed by Natural Selection, is fully inadequate as a machine for the generation of this information. Dawkins has still failed to provide a legitimate functional source theory for the origin of it.Unless someone in the near future can produce a scientifically viable source and mechanism for the origin and generation of this information, the grand sweep of evolution will be left swept into the recycling bin of the developing fields of modern science."
1,THEORY WORSHIP,"Nothing like a little theory-worship via natural darwinology to spice up the competition with Genesisology.Made for enjoyable reading the same way Aesop's Fables amuse.Amusing thinking process by Dawkins & disciples: E=mc2E is Evolution, m is material world, c is credulity.Evolution creates material world ONLY IF credulity is squared as your religious constant in the atheistic equation. Amen.Thanks to the author for making his article of faith and religious belief system he worships by evident to all."
2,fatih for faith,I tried hard to read this book as an intelligent challenge to my faith - only to find that Dawkin's arguements require a leap of faith also- something about how irrational he is about religion - seems to dump his scientific mind and operate on raw emotion - sometimes something more like hate at times.The man has something to say - but he really should stick with the things that he can talk about intelligently rather than straying off into a rant.
5,Evolution made poetic,"This is truly a fine book. The ease with which he explains complex evolutionary concepts is a wonder to behold. Few biologists will take the subject's guiding principle to it's logical conclusion, but Dawkins does. There are those who call him arrogant, and so he is. It is important to note however that he has much to be arrogant about. It is the success of biology in explaining our origins, and much about who we are that I think most repells certain kinds of readers. There are those who would prefer more mystery, something more supernatural about us. And it really irks people when a scientist, with utterly compelling evidence to the contrary comes along and says, ""Wait a minute, look here, maybe there is something wrong with our cherished cosmologies, and mythologies that needs fixing."" Such an approach quite plainly puts the responsiblity of changing our cherished notions in our lap."
5,A profoundly good read.,"+AH4-Richard Dawkins well deserves his numerous accolades. Without doubt he is among the most imaginative, lucid and thought provoking science popularizers alive. In ""The Blind Watchmaker"" Dawkins elegantly and convincingly does away with popular misconceptions about evolution, most particularly the misconception that evolution is all about overcoming astronomically improbable odds in a single leap. If Dawkins can be faulted for anything it is for his overly+AH4-+AH4- gentlemanly handling of his less than gentlemanly (and, often, less than scholarly) attackers+AH4-"
3,Not what I expected,"The book is not bad, it is just not what I expected. It seemed like it was written for followers. Quite technical for the casual reader. I was looking for more justification for evolution over ""intelligent design."" It is in there but not for a casual reader."
4,"Excellent biology, Biased theology","Except for the atheist bias, Dawkins book is one of the best explanations of Darwinian evolution written to date. For a non-biologist, the book may be a bit difficult to understand and the small print certainly does not make the reading any easier.The clarity of the explanation of cumulutive change over time through natural selection as the cause of the diversity of life on Earth is a wonderful testimony to Dawkins expertise. Because of the bias against religion, the argument for abiogensis is unconvincing. If it were not for this flaw, I would have rated the book five stars, as it is extremely well written. Dawkins writes with his usual systematic logic and well organized thought. If you are new to Dawkins, I would start out with River Out of Eden, instead of this book, as it is not so technically based."
4,Readable and believable anti-creationist text,"Dawkins presents a convincing argument with vivid examples. He focuses on the wondrous results of cumulative evolution.Despite the later chapters that discuss controversies that are of little interest to the general public, this book makes fascinating reading for the laymen in evolutionary biology.Anyone who occasionally finds him/herself having supper with creationists and wants to spar will benefit from reading this. It clarifies much of what we ""think"" we know of Darwinian theories."
1,None are so blind as they who will not see,"A watch cannot be made blind; the blind cannot be made to watch.Therefore the world is designed, not dumb willy-nilly hopscotch."
1,blind faith in brute forces of dumb selectivity,"I actually read the book. Like good sci-fi, interesting but fictitious in its premises and conclusions. Even if natural selection mechanism is not statistically equivalent to chanciness, to endorse the notion that a pimple on some primitive creature migrated or gravitated or transmogrified to today's sophisticated eye (in matching colored pairs, mind you) takes more faith than accepting Genesis as eyewitness account of Someone Who was there In the Beginning.This book is not just about The Blind Watchmaker. It is about Blind Faith in Brute Forces of Dumb Selectivity unintelligently creating intelligence. Life as we know it emerged from pre-life as we don't know it? Pre-life emerged from ... chance? Or is it pre-chance?"
1,Dying Theory,"This book still clings to the dying theory of Darwin's Natural Selection hypothesis!! Then Dawkin's tries to apologize by stating that even if it were not so, Darwin's is still the best way to go!! Icreditable logic!! I did enjoy reading the book to see how his mind works. He needs to go to Amazon.com and pick out a good adventure tale to read."
5,Following Scientific Principles,"I'm not going to pontificate or enter the fray of debunking creationism. Like the scientific tradition that he admirably represents, Dawkins exhibits clarity and parsimony in his defense of Darwinism. The interested reader - with some concentration - will learn much about the nuances of Darwinian theory, critical thinking, and modern biology. Reading ""The Blind Watchmaker"" is an excellent use of your time.Oh, and check your dogma at the door."
5,Great Book,"Very, very solid book. Definitely worth my time and money. Great ideas and concepts. Really accessible but not extremely easy-reading (sometimes you actually have to think, but I see that as an upside, not a problem).Some digressions are too digressive.It is also a shame that some pages were unavoidably dedicated to debunking some very silly criticism of Neo-Darwinism. However, as I said, it was unavoidable and at least they will give you additional arguments if you happen to find someone who actually believes that the universe is 6.000 years old and things like that."
4,Why did he re-write it and call it Climbing Mount Improbable?,"I read this and some of his more recent books. His more recent books are excellent: very well written, entertaining, and cogent.Watchmaker is my least favorite Dawkins book [so far]. In a few places, it is sloppy and unconvincing, although the thesis is right on the mark and almost speaks for itself to anyone with an appropriate technical background.I haven't read Climbing Mount Improbable but I would guess that it is much better. Why else would he have re-written the same book ten years later?"
4,Bats who see in color and much more,"While I did find myself feeling the sense of awe and intellectual stimulation that I get from good science writing in many of this books pages, it wasn't the instant page-turner of a book like 'The Selfish Gene'. In fact I read this book right after the aforementioned book. The Selfish Gene is a hard book to live up to. Having said that, some sections of this book give you that sense of awe at the biological world that Dr. Dawkins is so good at presenting. Reading passages of this book to some of my scientist, but sadly religious friends around the campfire, found them quite interested as well."
2,Caught up in the discussions of the day,"While the point Dawkins makes is obviously right and a good point, he frequently looses himself in endless repetition of the same argument, and many of the chapters serve to refute discussions of the day or more frequently discussions of the early days of Darwinism.I read the 2006 edition cover to cover and had hoped that he would update this with some of the more interesting questions - how genes get expressed, more modern knowledge of embryology, but found that the latest edition does not share the insights gained in the last 30 years. Also, some of his arguments refuting other theories are so thin, that a highschool student could prick them in a hour (look for his arguments on mutationism, there full of obvious nonsense).That is unfortunate, since the core premise, that Darwin was right about natural selection is so important that is deserves a passionate plea. But it also deserves a plea that is better made and more up to date with today's knowledge."
2,Fervently religious,"Dr. Dawkins is as fervent in his religion (humanism) as any religious person I know. I'm skeptical of anyone who seems to think he's smarter than God. (Yes, I know he doesn't believe in God.)He writes himself a computer simulation program that tells him that ""Yes, evolution the way you envision it really could happen"". Surprise, surprise."
5,Blew my mind,This book really got me into science. It is a fantastic read and really helped me understand who natural selection works.
1,Poorly Organized - Poorly Written,"This is one of the worst books I have read on this subject. The author ignores a plethora of scientific material, almost as if it doesn't exist. He makes assertions that are either poorly substantiated or provides no definitive support whatsoever! I would definitely not recommend this book for anyone wanting a balanced discussion on the subject of Intelligent Design and evolution."
1,Where is the evidence?,"In this book you can't tell where the science ends and where religion begins. Dawkins has done a good job of blending them into one another as an attempt to justify his materialistic worldview. While reading this book I kept wondering, where is this Evidence of Evolution that Reveals a Universe Without Design? I kept looking for the evidence but never found it. Dawkins uses misdirection and fancy wording but fails to offer any proof for his blind watchmaker theory.Read this book carefully and look at the evidence for yourself. Then judge whether or not the evidence supports the authors conclusion. Dawkins, very sneaky, doesn't examine what complexity is or how it could have arisen by random mutatons. Moreover, he doesn't even examine the statistical probability of his theory. But yet wants to convince the reader that life could evolve without outside help. The message is convincing, but lacks any evidence to support it."
1,Duhhh,"So let's see: Richard Dawkins's computer can generate interesting 'biomorphs' IF IT'S PROPERLY PROGRAMMED, and a roomful of monkeys can type out 'Methinks it is a weasel' by repeated typing IF AN INTELLIGENT HUMAN BEING MONITORS THE PROCESS AND RETAINS THE CORRECT LETTERS. And this is supposed to demonstrate the Watchmaker's *blindness*? Cuh-monnnnnn."
1,The Argument For Design,"It is not a stretch of the imagination to claim that scientific evidencesupports the idea of a design in Nature. The real argument is not overthe presence of design but over the source of the design. Is it the random, ignorant, process of mutation and natural selection esposed byDawkin`s or the work of an Intelligent Designer.After a full assessmentof Dawkin`s book, I opt for the latter.I find it remarkable how oftenthe creativity we find in nature is so similar to human design-albeit,Nature`s are usually more exquisite , optimal, or efficient."
2,Creation and Modeling,"For the skeptics of the Biomorph experiments:When you try to model a system, you always have to intervene to define the parameters of the model! With nature, the parameters are defined by the physical world (melting point of water etc...) In a computer model, these parameters have to somehow be defined by human intervention. This is the ""creation"" that is taking place and it doesn't detract from the validity of the rest of the experiment. (Of course the rest of the experiment MAY be flawed, but then this would be a different issue.)"
2,"Nice try, but philosophy isn't the same thing as science.","Richard Dawkins has written a brilliantly written and woefully mistaken defense of non-teleological Darwinism. I notice that I am in the minority in giving him a low rating; don't worry, guys, I HAVE read the book! Dawkins does a great job of explication, *assuming* that his ideas of evolutionary continuity and the efficacy of mindless processes to produce organized complexity are correct. However, that is a pretty big assumption.Michael Behe has given some of Dawkins' more egregious examples a badly needed skewering in his new book, _Darwin's Black Box_ (Interestingly enough, many people seem to think that Dawkins has pre-refuted Behe. I find this belief to be unconvincing, as will most people who have *actually read* DBB, as opposed to the unfavorable reviews.) For an intelligent presentation of ""the other side"", I would recommend that fair-minded readers give Behe a hearing"
2,"Exhaustive, and exhausting","This book discusses the arguements in favor of the theory of evolution, and is persuasive, IF you can get through it. If you can think in 9 dimensions (instead of 4), you can probably get through this without problems. I can't, but I still slogged through it, in spite of the fact that I didn't know what he was talking about.In summary, if you're a genius, especially in mathematics, you can probably follow this. If not, get ""Letter to A Christian Nation""."
3,Tasted Okay,"It is very much like white rice that is why the fiber content is very low. This rice would be great for someone to ease in to eating real brown rice. I prefer real brown rice because it's chewy and nutty. The price is not that great, I can get organic brown rice at a local health food store for $1.99/LB and I don't have to buy a large quanity."
2,Not so great,The pen seems to be good. But the major issue is usability. The entire pen is chrome...it is very difficult to grip the pen as a result while writing. I have bought it ...but do not use it
2,Difficult to use,I agree with the other reviewer. The part of the pen that you grip when writing is slippery chrome. This makes writing with the pen difficult and uncomfortable.
5,mr music man . 100% responsable.,"exelente envio , mr music man , estoy muy agradecido por su envio fue rapido ,, siga asi exito!!!!!!!"
2,Disappointed,Very disappointed with this tree. Way out of true making it almost dangerous to use. Requires a large shim to keep it from rocking.
4,Content,"A solid well made weight tree at a reasonable price. Easy to assemble, I would definately purchase a second one."
3,"OK book, but could use more information","This book is pretty good for those who have very little or no knowledge on the subject of back pain. However, it offers very little to anyone who has studied the subject with some effort. I was hoping for some new insights on treating my own back pain when I purchased this book and got virtually no new information to help my situation."
5,Great Imagery,I used this book for a project in school. Amazing pictures and very intelligent passages about the founding of Witchcraft and associated events. The Salem Witch Trials are nicely noted and I used the bulk of it for my research paper.
4,Cool,"I am not a satanist or a warlock or anything, but I do think this book is really interesting because it has a lot of very weird little-known facts about not just witchcraft but ancient history, literature, fairies, and paranormal experiences. Fun just to browse through. It also has great pictures."
3,Not enough power,"Though it seems so blow enough air. It doesn't do a very good job, I had to go over areas on the bike quite a few times to get the area dry. It left the bike with a lot of water spots. I had to later go over with a rag to get ride of them."
3,Good but predictable,"I thought this was a pretty good book. I am not one for Harlequin, so taking on this book was new to me. It was okai, though, and it really got to the heart of the main character's soul. A little slow, but it is worth reading a short book like that. Very relaxing still."
4,good buy,"I use the Makita grinder of this same size a lot at work, but when I decided to buy my own for use in my shop I bought this Hitachi model. Honestly I only bought the Hitachi because it was cheaper, but now that I've put some miles on it I like it as much or more than the Makita. The Hitachi has a better locking slide power button and feels more powerful. The only negatives are that it is slightly heavier than the Makita and that it sounds a little rough on the shutdown. Oh yes the lock button for changing discs is an excellent idea that works well. If you plan to use the machine as a sander,as I often do, the Makita sanding pad, discs, and lock nut fit this machine."
4,i coriander,this is a great story about a girl who's mother dies father go to jail for helping the king escape for exile and helping a boy about her age not be killed . i hope will enjoy this book as much as i do.
4,Couldn't put it down!,"I loved this book so much that I stayed up till 3am to finish it even though I had work the next day. I couldn't put it down. My only complaint is that the ending was kind of rushed and felt unfinished. I wish there had been some info on what became of the grandfather and fairy stepsister after the queen was gone. And I wish there had been a bit more development on the prince. But still, it is a fabulous book."
4,"Beautiful Writing, Captivating Story","Nine-year-old Coriander's world is happy, carefree, and wonderful. When she begins to get glimpses of another world, she does not think it extraordinary, and her happiness reaches its peak when she is given a pair of beautiful silver shoes. So when Coriander's world is plunged into turmoil, she is unprepared- unprepared, but brave enough to face what lies ahead, even when the future holds Maud Leggs, Arise Fell, and Queen Rosmore. To make matters worse, Coriander can no longer rely on her father to straighten everything out, as he has been accused of helping King Charles II to escape from England.Sally Gardner's writing is beautiful and flawless; her descriptions enchanting. She has painted a beautiful portrait of London in the mid-1600s, and her fantasy will spark the imagination of every reader.See the rest of my reviews at www.mrsmagooreads.blogspot.com."
3,Beautiful but somehow lacking,"I had high hopes for this book. The pictures, on its cover, chapter titles and section titles, gave me such a boost that I didn't mind to buy the hardcover edition.However, despite the very interesting start, I felt a little bored from the center part. The prince part did wake me up but just until they met problem about living in both worlds. Too vague and I didn't feel the story really ended."
4,"Entertaining, but has holes","I will say that I really enjoyed this book. It is simple, light-hearted, and it is a fast read. As an adult though, I do have to agree with the previous reviews. The flow was a bit staggered, their were unrealistic reactions to certain events, and there were areas that were just a bit confusing. I.E.: Were we told that the King and Queen were in a second marriage and that the king had a daughter of his own? Coriander seems to figure this out pretty quickly, but exactly how she did it with the little information that she had (she sees a picture): I just don't know.If I were a child/young adult I don't think I would have noticed these things. You become very wrapped-up in Coriander's life and you do want to see how it all pans out. Which it does do VERY quickly! It's a Cinderella story with a few more twists and turns and a bit of historical reference as well. And the cover is beautiful. :)"
5,Miss Tina...The Legend,"Tina Turner is one of the most amazing people that have ever graced the planet Earth. And this concert is proof. Capturing all the attitude of her ""Twenty Four Seven Tour"", after one viewing you'll have ""Tina Fever"" for a lifetime.The songs that are presented are just a fine selection to showcase Tina's prowess. Some of her hits are missing(in fact nothing from her amazing ""Wildest Dreams"" album is sung), but nevermind that. This is Tina giving a show the way it should be.The bonus interview footage is very similar to the footage on her ""Wildest Dreams Tour"" video and DVD. It showed Miss Tina backstage, onstage, and offstage. It is fun and any Tina fan will throughly enjoy it.This is one concert DVD that is sure to heat up your nights. If you didn't see Tina live, or just want to re-live that glory that is Tina, then don't pass this one up."
1,YOUR HEAD WILL SPIN!!!,"I got dizzy trying to watch this crazy video. I guess it was edited in the current style, with no shot held more than 10 seconds (most held for less time than that!) Perhaps I am unusual that I like to watch a performer perform, and I believe that a performance builds. This dvd is so disjointed, with rapid cuts from Tina to frenetic audience members to other dancers to overhead shots of the entire stadium, that it's impossible to take in."
3,I can bearly hear Tina's voice,"Great show! Excellent artist!But the DVD sound really makes me disappointed. Tina's voice is almost ""buried"" in the loudness. One must try very hard to be able to hear her singing."
3,"good songs, bad dvd",Tina is a great performer and I could have enjoyed the DVD if only the quality was better. It looks like a VHS copy of a VHS to a DVD. I don't know how they could have messed it up so bad. Very immature recording.
4,Fan,"Ms. Turner is a once in a lifetime performer, the quality of this video is pretty good, and of course the songs, and dancers are great."
3,A Great Concert Ruined by Lousy Video Editing.,"This is an excellent Tina Turner concert that was absolutely ruined by the worst video editing I have ever seen. The video keeps changing from Tina's front to back, to the audience, a full shot of the stadium, the dancers and does not stay on any one for more than a few seconds! Enough already, I'm getting dizzy!But if you turn off the TV and just listen to the music, this is DVD is absolutely wonderful! Tina is great, the songs are great, and the sonic is just wonderful!"
2,A good concert but piss poor transfer to DVD,I'm afraid that this one is a doozy. Her Amsterdam concert was more 'live' than this one. This one looked 'gimicky' and though Tina had a lot of energy i could hardly hear her voice. Whoever mixed this recording needs to have his/her ears checked.The thing of good value to me was the extra features ... but then you do not buy a DVD for the extras if you've been promised that the 'show' is great.i am disappointed in the DVD but that 'set-up' looked kinda funky.
2,Horrible audio,"This dvd is of poor quality, the audio is horrible, you can't hear her words to the song over the audience. Would not recommend."
2,Tina Turner is the Best,I grew up with Tina Turner. She is one of the best. I have had the opportunity to see her in person about 4 times. Having this video brings all the great times right in my living room.Doug
5,Tina is Fabulous!,I first saw this performance on a PBS special and taped it on my DVR but just had to get a copy of my own so I can see if in the years to come. Tina is getting better with age. I also love her dancers and vocal back-up group!A Fan from Hawaii
2,Poor sound quality!,"I am not rating this disc 2 stars because of Turner's performance. She gives an excellent show. What upsets me is that the sound quality of this DVD could and should be much better. If this is the way DVD sound is going to go than I wish the times of good old laserdiscs would come back. Just listen to the DTS laserdisc of Tina Turner live in Amsterdam (or the Dolby digital version) and you will get the point. They give a feeling that you are in the crowd. Of course, if you have never experienced these laserdiscs and come from crappy VHS, then you will enjoy this. High end audiophiles with a decent home theater however will be very disappointed."
1,So-called Rose Oil,We ordered this rose oil as we have in the past but this shipment smelled like a wet cat. I sent it back but they said it was not defective and charged me a restocking fee and the postage which amounted to 30% of the cost. This is NOT a good company to deal with. I see now it is not stocked. . . which proves that it was defective.
1,Cheap,"Aside from the bamboo, everything else was synthetic. Most of the parts should be made of leather. The stitching started coming undone after my first practice. For the money, I'd stick with shinai from ebogu."
5,This is Bride at its best.,"The Jesus Experience is from the first song to the very last, hard. People who love hard rock, plus a spiritual slap straight into the face in every song will love this one."
2,Disappointed,"I'm not a hard core Bride fan so that may be why I am disappointed in this cd. The first five tracts are good, but the rest is not worth listening too. It doesn't even sound like Dale on the vocals."
4,Pretty good.,"The cd is pretty good. Lovely Feet is really awesome, but some of the other songs are slightly boring- such as Wavy Gravy. If you're into Christian music and want to listen to something a little bit different, you should try this cd."
1,"Please stop singing in public places, my ears can't take it.",This is ultimately the best band that I have ever heard in my whole life. Too bad that I am deaf.
3,Too General,The book tries to cover too much with little detail. The information on my 40 HP Outboard did not match the electrical or fuel system. Pay the extra money and get the service manual for your Outboard.
3,OK for the Basics,"This manual is better than no manual at all. However, if detail and completeness are required you had better step up and buy the factory service manaul at 3x the cost. If you are the casual mechanic this manual will probably serve you well."
3,Not as in-depth as I had hoped,"I have a Seloc manual for my Evinrude and am very pleased with it's content. However, for some reason, this Merc manual isn't as in-depth as the E-Rude manual.Case in point: I needed to replace the prop shaft on my Merc, but the manual doesn't contain any information on lower unit disassembly; the E-Rude manual does.The only lower unit coverage in this book is basic maintenance. Nothing more.The powerhead section seems to be quite complete and the wiring diagrams are nice, but again . . . no lower unit info!!!"
4,Good manual at a great price,This manual doesn't cover everything in finite detail but it is thorough enough that you will be able to figure out the rest. It was good enough for me to replace the water pump and seals in my 175HP Merc Lower unit with no previous experience with boat motors.
4,A very usefull handbook,"Not too much details but if you have a little clue of what you're messing with, it will help a lot!"
3,Ahhh it's okay.,"I purchased these Dean's plugs because a lot of people in the hobby world swear by them. I'm gonna have to differ.If you're running a heavy duty ESC.. anything over 80amps, with a 6 cell or larger battery... the gauge of the wire is just too large making it very difficult to solder. Also my other biggest problem with Deans is the exposed connectors. If you happen to put the Male plug on the battery side... you're in for a very big shocking surprise when they touch metal. Say you disconnect them and the battery and those exposed male leads make contact with the skids.....Other then that.. these connectors do the job."
5,"Good, inexpensive plugs",Comes with everything you need to convert a battery and an aeg to deans. So much better conductivity so more efficient power to your gun and better performance.
5,excelent upgrade for an airsoft gun,I got these so that i could but them on my airsoft gun. they increased the rate of fire some what but most noticeably they decreased the reaction time of when i pull the trigger and when it shoots.
1,"Disappointing amount of info...don't bother buying it, you'll get more from google","I was very disappointed with this download. It's basically just an interview that was written up in the Mississippi Business Journal. It only has 981 words, most of which was the interviewee's quotes. No real content and definitely not worth $5.95. Save yourself the trouble and just google the topic, you'll get more and it'll be free."
5,I'm unable to forget this book,I read this book about 5 years ago and scenes from it still crop up in my mind out of the blue for no reason. I can't explain this. I guess it's one of the best books I've ever read.
2,Highschool English Essay,"Unfortunately I think I might have read a different book that the other glowing reviews. I'm not going to write anything long because I dont feel like it, but, the protagonist of the book learns nothing by the end of the book, and his murders are fueled by his hate for his father.Pass this up if you know whats good for you."
2,Save your money,"I purchased this book due to the eighteen 5 star reviews. And I disagree with them. This novel was horribly amateurish and simply written. It read like it was written by a high schooler. Although the idea behind the story wasn't bad, it was not executed well. It was like watching a bad movie, but after investing the time, I felt like I had to see it to the end. The only things positive I can write are that it was an easy read and the very ending was haunting. Not good enough reasons to waste your time reading this book."
5,Blackburn -- He Kills People -- You'll Like Him,"I swiped that title from the blurb on the jacket of the British edition. This is the novel AMERICAN PSYCHO could've been if the author of that hound could write. Jimmy Blackburn is a serial killer, and very often the reader will be cheering for Blackburn. It's a marvelous work of black humor and makes one re-examine one's belief in the solidity of civilization."
3,Dubious on facts,"It should not be assumed that this is a film biography of Wagner. It is just a film and like most films it allows itself more leverage to mutate the facts than any legit biography can possibly allow itself. It's a veneer beautiful in its setting and this is where its true art lies which makes it worth watching. Wagner's character was far more complicated than Tony Palmer's somewhat monolithic portrayal. Supporting characters like Nietzsche are also affected by its simplicity. It is worth watching in the sense that Amadeus is worth watching namely as a scenic, costume and music fest only. In comparison, Amadeus amounts to character assassination whereas Burton's portrayal of Wagner is very much one sided and hyperbolized. In short, this film is far less biography than highly enhanced entertainment. Nevertheless, Richard Burton's exceptional performance is one reason I still like to watch it."
2,"A disappointing waste of talent, great music, and scenery","I was extremely disappointed in this DVD set. Other reviewers have expressed some of the technical shortcomings. Given the stellar cast and the compelling story line, I expected a much more polished and engaging production. For me, this DVD shares some of the problems with Wagner's works -- flashes of brilliance surrounded by hours of repetition and tedium."
2,Burton's great but a travesty about Wagner,"Burton is magnificent as Wagner. He should have won an award - not for his portrayal but for his being able to keep a straight face speaking this purple prose, drivel of a script. Anyone who thinks this is about Wagner needs to read a biography or gain some taste. The script is a horrible mess of incredibly bad writing. The music is good even though it is ""conducted"" by Solti, a grossly over-rated conductor who was good in the big, splashy moments but totally lost otherwise. Enjoy Burton but don't take this as a biography of Wagner."
3,Terrible transfer/editing,"I agree with nearly all of your reviews, as I too, saw the originals on VHS and in the theatre. Shame on you, Kultur! With such glorious music, 5-star acting and profound mythological/philosophical references, artfully put together by the brilliant Tony Palmer, we are instead given a spliced, disjointed and frustrating facsimile. Wagner's life and work really constitutes an epic or legend, whatever his politics - his characters being parts of ourselves. As a devoted Wagnerite, I had to have this set, and if it weren't for the acting and the scenery, the terrible interior lighting and lengthy focuses on the composer's revolutionary past, would have driven me mad. Somehow this all seemed woven together in the original, and chopped up by Kultur. Sound is poor too...but as it's Richard Burton at his best, and because practically every one of the world's REAL actors, many deceased,are really enjoying themselves,it's worth buying."
1,the broken souls,"This was a disappointment as it was also printed under the title THE GARDEN OF VIPERS. If I had known that, I would not have purchased this book as I already have The Garden of Vipers (which is a good book)."
2,Reads Like A Textbook,"If you enjoy reading college textbooks, then you'll love this one. Although it's well-written with many illustrations/diagrams, facts and definitions, I didn't find any pleasure reading it. Fresh Water lacked anecdotes, humor, interesting point-of-views etc....just a DRY, BLAND and extremely objective view of the cycles, forms and uses of water. However, Fresh Water would be excellent reference material."
4,"Review of book ""The Mountain of the Women""",Book was in excellent condition and is a great read and a fascinating revelation into the life of the famous Irish singer - Liam Clancy.
4,Schmaltzing Matilda,"Liam Clancy is an exceptional performer, an accomplished actor, and to many minds (including my own) the most gifted folk singer on record. He has also led a thrilling, fortunate, and apparently fulfilling life, and his new book is, despite its technical flaws, a fascinating work that will delight fans and moreover should be required reading for any conscientious Irish performer...."
5,AN IRISH MEMOIR WORTH READING !,"Liam Clancy is an Irishman that is talented in the arts like so many of the Irish. His story starts as a young man in Ireland and stays in that country 'til he is an adult and then takes place in the USA, but always returns to his birthplace. His trials are many and it is really interesting to learn of his ups and downs and how his life straightens out without any particular planning on his part. Success just happens and thank goodness it does. A grand read and well worth your while."
3,Seriously?,"Shout sure knows how to get blood out of a turnip. There are about half a dozen ""timeless"" episodes on this set, but not near what I'd hoped. I'll be skipping this one and sticking with my season sets. It's a pity, because I'm sure had there been more of the better ""timeless"" episodes (""They Shoot Fat Women, Don't They?"" ""The Beauty Contest,"" ""Design House,"" ""The Emperor's New Nose,"" ""Blame It On New Orleans""...so many better episodes they could have chosen...this would have sold much better.I was planning on buying over two dozen copies of this had the episode selection been better. Sure, that's not a ton of money, but I'm sure I wasn't the only one."
4,"If you like westerns you are due to read ""DEVIL'S DUE""","Ralph Cotton has written another pretty good western. New people with funny sounding names are in this one. Quick Charlie Sims, Twojack Roth and Steelhead Radner to name a few. I did not like the two men who were really women. Which two----read to find out. This will hold your attention and has a lot of action. The ending is fantastic. Would never have thought of it ending the way it did. It is well worth reading the book for the last few pages."
1,"Hunk of Junk! Cheap ""Littermaid"" for those not wanting to pay $100","This is a hunk of junk. I had a fully automatic Littermaid and this ""one-step"" is just a cheap knock-off of the original. If you don't constantly run over there and step on it so it scoops the litter it gets jammed up whenever it tries to scoop more than one bathroom usage. This is for people who have heard great things about Littermaids from their friends and family so they want one but don't want to pay $100. Think Littermaid's going to have a lot of disgruntled customers. All this is is a cat box with a rake that you step-on to trigger it to move, why is it even $40+? Should be less than $20 tops."
2,LITTER MESS,"NOT AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. NOT MUCH POWER, SO WON'T CLEAN AND DUMP IF THERE IS EVEN A MODERATE AMT. OF CLUMPS. DOESN'T REACH NEAR THE BOTTOM, SO I ALWAYS STILL HAVE TO SCOOP IT MYSELF."
2,littermaid one step litterbox...disappointing,"I have always had a self cleaning litter box for my previous cats, and just loved them. This was my first LitterMaid and I am very disappointed. The rake does not go to the bottom of the tray and misses half the clumps, which I have to scoop out myself.I have tried to repeat and still I end up scooping, very disappointing. I called them, but they said there was nothing they could do. What good is the warrenty!! I will be calling them again!"
1,Hot Garbage,This box is terrible. I got it after my original littermaid died. (My old modle lasted about 6yrs) This one was a real piece of junk. You cannot take the waste recepticle out without it snapping and spraying waste all over. The rake gets stuck constantly and mine broke after about a month in a place that you CANNOT fix. Don't waste your money.
5,Excellent!,"I love brown rice, and this is superb. The only rice I like better is wild rice. YUM to both."
3,Not for the little guys,"We bought this book thinking it it would help small online merchants, but the ""Merchant"" in the title is misleading. It is written more for large organizations that are having a complete website developed custom for them, not for the little guys trying to get going. Also, hundreds of new ecommerce programs have been developed since this book was written which this book does not cover. And the information is outdated, such as it is no longer necessary to open a merchant account directly with your bank, or process your own credit cards on your website, as we later found out. There are companies and resellers who take care of all that for you, even including security.If you are going to start out with a big business like Amazon or Yahoo you might find the background information useful, but most businesses start out with just one or two people trying to learn everything. If you are small entrepeneurs like us, look for something more specific."
5,*****GREAT BOOK!*****,A must have book if you're starting or already have an online business. I have earmarked almost every page in this book...need I say more?
1,Want create a generic Fortune 500 version of the web....,"I don't think they intended wrong, but this book isn't really about the being a successful ecommerce merchant. It's about being a corporate voiced merchant without listening to your customers. I was extremely disappointed in the copy I got, luckily it was free.You want to be online and really participate, go buy Cluetrain or Gonzo Marketing. Then hire a good webperson to help you make it happen."
2,Not for me,"Book felt like a sequence of contrived situations which forced the characters to deliver soliloquies to each other based on their various views. The issues the author was trying to nut out are undeniably serious, but felt cheapened by his heavy handed technique. I'm sure other people would love it, but not my thing."
2,tough to read,"I found the writing very stilted, with painful metaphors and laughably unrealistic dialog. That was unfortunate since the plot was actually fairly interesting."
4,A fun read,"The story line centers on a rumor that excites people eventhough both parties have been dead for over two decades. However, tohis credit Robert S. Levinson turns that rumor into an interesting who-done-it that makes the plot more than just a one-line tale. The lead characters are an intriguing duo, especially their off-kilter relationship that seems to fit Hollywood.. Mr. Levinson pulls out the sensationalism most readers try to hide, but makes it feel respectable.Harriet Klausner"
1,Bulwar-Lytton entry,This is the first book I have read in which the entire manuscript should have been entered in the Bulwar-Lytton bad writing contest. It would be a runaway winner!
5,One of the Heavenly Voices,"This CD will raise your consciousness! Every cut is very good and some are spectacular. I can play it over and over without getting tired of it and wake up in the morning days later with one of the songs playing in my head.I'm not a fan of opera per se, but Giorgia shows what a classically trained voice can do with pop tunes and some inspirational songs like ""Piece of Heaven,"" and ""A rose among thorns.""I would never have heard of her but for a promotional CD sent with ""Celtic Woman, Deluxe."" Highly recommended."
5,"Heavenly, Romantic, Beautiful","Soothing to the soul, romantic and the voice of an angel!Giorgia sings with a wonderful voice range, yet seemingly effortless. It is as if she is personally conversing with you. She will tenderly grab your attention and your heart. Maybe her style could be thought of as a pleasant mixture between the best of opera and classical, with a contemporary touch.""Your Love"" expresses to me her beauty and excellence of voice. What an introduction to the CD! ""Peace of Heaven"" sends a divine atmosphere. ""A Rose among Thorns"" is so melodically soothing to the soul. My favorite is ""Campi d'Oro"" - tender, romantic. ""Volero"" concludes the songs - it leaves me with feelings of flying through the heavens without a care in the world.Don't just take my word on Giorgia, check her CD out for yourself. You'll be glad you did!"
3,Not as good as I had hoped for,"She has a beautiful voice but not much else to brag about. The songs are okey but nothing mega. I was looking for somebody like Sarah Brightman or Emma Shapplin, Not even close."
1,Elite?,"I don't see what's so great about West Point. I expected that standards would be higher. This is just like any old college with a little boot camp thrown in. Even a Rolling Stone writer can't disguise that this is an increasingly irrelevant institution, out of touch with the times, and a waste of taxpayer money. If this is a $250,000 education, then I've got some great deals on hammers and toilet seats for you."
4,How they do it,Take American kids and turn them into leaders. This is not the West Point you think you know. Fascinating and comforting. You will be hooked and looking to the end of the book for any info on those you meet.
5,A MUST READ!!,"This book may be the best book I have ever read. I will make the most Army hating person, want to stand up and go to West Point. The stories of these cadets were truly inspiring, and you could see how ppl from all walks of life came together."
5,A Truly Wonderful Book,"This is a fabulous book. Lipsky succeeds in humanizing the Army by spotlighting the members of West Point classes 1998 to 2002. While this book is about West Point, it is told by focusing on the stories of individual cadets, and the cadets Lipsky follows through the arc of the story are compelling and fascinating people. You cannot read this book and not come away awed by the strength of their character. I was truly inspired by the young men and women Lipsky describes that choose to test themselves with 4 years at West Point and then service to their country in the military. Honor, valor, strength of character, intelligence...these cadets have them in spades. This is a fascinating portrait of a world most people never learn about, let alone experience. I can't recommend this book enough. And finally, thanks to all members of our armed forces for putting their lives at risk to protect our country."
3,Good stories but writing style detracts from the substance,"I think ""Absolutely American"" could have been so much more, but fell short. I am so glad that David Lipsky recorded the stories of the cadets, West Point History, and the instructors for all of us to read. Unfortunately, Lipsky's writing style is disjointed and detracts from the compelling stories. His chapters jump back and forth, and try to cover the experiences of too many cadets at once. I wish that Lipsky had stuck with a few key cadets, and not inserted so many other anecdotes because it made his work difficult to follow. I can't exactly pinpoint why Lipsky's writing style falls short of paying the stories justice--perhaps it's almost to MTVish (i.e jumping back and forth.) However, I believe that David Lipsky does give the public a better, clearer idea of what it means to be a cadet at West Point. It's worth the read for the substance, but certainly not the style.My favorite story was of Don ""Whitey"" Herzog and his career choices."
2,Eh!,"This book is getting a great buildup, so I got hold of one to read during these lazy days of summer. Great for falling asleep on the beach. What a disappointment, for me, anyway. Mr. Lipsky is a good writer, but it is not the right subject for him."
2,Huge Holes In Story,"The author had unlimited access but tells a very unbalanced story.My main issue is (like Thucydides20) that the academics are totally ignored. That is such a huge part of life at the Point, as various grads have told me.Also, the regular Honor Code scandals is another point ignored in the book. The book talks about the Honor Code with a ""see no evil"" mentality. Yet every 10-15 years, regular as clockwork, there is a cheating scandal related to that code.While we are at it, there is very little written about the teachers. It is a shame Lipsky chose not to spend any time with them.I also had major problems with the format of the book, it jumps around way too much. Just when you are starting to get a feel for a cadet, you are jerked away from that person.I have spent a lot of time at the Point and have great affection for the institution and its people. It is a shame that given unlimited access, Lipsky did such a poor job."
2,Absolutely America Format,"This day and age, you would think that most books on tape are CD's - this was a cassette and I did not discover it until after opening the package - made it most difficult to listen to, considering the car did not come equipped with a cassette tape player - too new a car!!!"
1,Boring And Unimportant,"This book sounded like it would be interesting and important, but instead, I found it to be boring and unimportant. There are a lot of other negative impressions I got out of this, but, the main one was that it was very, very, slow, uninteresting, and boring."
1,DISAPPOINTING,THIS BOOK WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING. I COULDN'T WAIT TO READ IT AS I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FASCINATED WITH WEST POINT. LIPSKY'S WRITING IS CHOPPY AT BEST. I GOT MORE OUT OF THE LONG GREY LINE THAN I DID THIS POORLY WRITTEN BOOK. ...
4,Not too bad!,"SAS is the British version of the US Army's Delta Force, not the Green Berets or the Rangers. (Delta is actually based after the British SAS) Despite some minor mistakes I think this is still a pretty good book."
2,Huah,"I was anxious to read a book taking off on the Al Pacinno theme from his very successful movie Scent of a Woman. After finishing the first fifty pages of Absolutely American of which I was all excited, HUAH, and all it stands for, was no longer to be found. It was a letdown. I found the overall theme of the book to be very weak in holding my interest and the pages seemed filled with the daily trivia of army life in the non-combat arena."
5,Great Book!,"David Lipsky really has given those of us outside of the military an idea of what life is like within the walls of West Point. Illustrating good and bad, it gives, without social commentary, great descriptions of the struggles that cadets go through and helps show why West Point is one of the finest institutions of higher learning in the United States. I thought that places where students are placed through true trials and tribulations, where character is tested and developed, where academics are taught with idealistic fervor by professors who have real-world international experience no longer existed. It puts our Harvards and Yales to shame, actually, and shows why so many of America's best and brightest come from West Point. Interesting, inciteful, and often humerous."
3,TOO small for my house.,"I think this maybe my own fault, this item sure looked alot more sturdy over the internet than it did when I got it. When I received it I thought they had sent me an electric cord reel instead of a waterhose reel. As I am learning from other internet purchases you might want to take out a ruler and get an idea as in this case 1/2"" in a hose is not as big as it appears maybe w/ tlc it might last a yr. but not in my yard I gave mine to a new neighbor who needed a hose but only had a postage stamp of a yard to water. The plastic reel it self,once you added water to hose didn't look like it would actually be able to be rolled back in i'll have to check w/ the neighbor and see."
5,New Country Fan,I'm 62 and decided to become a country music fan. Getting Miranda's album for $5 was great (since I'm on a fixed income more like broken income after the Great Bush Recession). Love all the tunes on here. She's got the classic country sound.
5,Great CD,"I don't buy too many cd's anymore. With Ol' Waylon and Johnny Cash gone, there is nothing much out there on the Country radio waves that pleases my ears. I like something different. When I saw Miranda Lambert singing ""Kerosene"" on the Country Music Awards a couple of years ago, I said ""Who is that?"" That is sure different. I bought that cd & was very impressed. Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is just as good if not better. I'm not saying that Miranda Lambert will be other Waylon or Johnny Cash, but you could say she takes one step over the line. Singing and writing songs like ""Kerosene"", ""Crazy Ex-Girlfriend"" and ""Gunpowder & Lead"" reminds me a little of Johnny Cash's ""Delia's Gone"". CMT wouldn't air that video because of the contents. Shame on them! Johnny got them back. Emmy's right & left! That's another thing that I like about Miranda, she writes most of her own songs. Buy the album, you won't be sorry."
3,Thanks,CD came quickly and in great condition. I didn't like it as much as i thought I would though. Seller was great though. Thank you!
3,"OK, but too much technology.","The songs on this album are good and I like the singer's voice, but there is such extensive use of pitch-correction circuitry, constantly pulling Lambert's voice onto the correct note, that it sounds to me like a robot is singing. I listened last night with a musician friend and we were constantly wincing at the overuse of processing until we finally took the CD out of the player.Maybe this is something non-musicians will not notice, but it ruined the album for me. If Lambert is having trouble hitting the right notes, perhaps she should practice a little instead of hooking up a machine to ""correct"" her problem."
2,Less bad language,"Her music would be really good if she would not use the bad language in her songs. I know she is not the only artist who uses bad language, but what does that accomplish? A truly good writer could come up with descriptive words that do not use this language. Nashville....clean up your act! We need more writers like Josh Turner and Randy Travis."
2,Dissapointed,"Compaired to Miranda's last CD which was perfect in my opinion, this one was way below what we all know she can produce. My hope is that she is not a one hit wonder and she returns to the quality of her last CD."
2,"Maybe, But Not Yet","At 24 years old, Miranda's tracks sound like a 14-year-old's. Kasey Chambers she ain't. Might be able to give a good delivery on a recording when she's 34 years old...but not yet."
5,AWESOME!,Miranda Lambert is one of the few female country artists I really enjoy. I typically find myself enjoying the male voices of country music but she is truely great. I love this CD and I think anyone who loves country music will enjoy it too. She's a down-home country girl with a story to tell and a great voice to tell it with!
4,Works very well for me,"Selected this drive after driving self crazy(er) researching drives. Use it with XP and Win 98 with no problems at all (98 did require drivers; also it shows up as two HDs on that [FAT file 32G limitation. No biggie]).Both use USB port for power. No other cords needed.(I do plug it directly into the puter, not into a hub.)Summing up:It's small and quick and slick and built like a brick.And if I wanted to drag my data with me, I would hardly know it was in my bag. In its included case.So: I'm very happy."
1,USB port broke after 3 weeks,This is a very sleek unit that offers a wonderful functional experience -- while it's working. I loved it until I noticed that the USB port was broken and rattling around inside the unit. Now it's a paperweight. I am waiting for a reply from IOGEAR on how they intend to repair it.I will write another review based on this experience. But I can say in all honesty that the product is fragile in design and probably shouldn't be carried around even in a laptop bag.
1,a disaster one month at a time,"Upon receipt it was dead, after a mixture of e-mailes and phone calls it was determined I needed to use 2 USB cables to power the drive. Since I only have 2 on my laptop, I cant print from the drive. after transfering 10 gig of pictures and 13 gig of mp3's the unit failed the next month. Again emails and phone calls determined my laptop did not have enough power to run the drive. The solution was an AC adapter.....great for a ""portable USB drive"" They said an AC adaptor would be sent...no adapter after 4 weeks now. I tried the drive on 4 other DESKTOPS, plenty of USB power, but no luck. I have lost so much information, pictures, and music and now no emails refering to my ""service number"" are being answered at all.A total lack of customer servive AND knolage of their own product. Think long and hard before dealing with Iogear!!"
3,It is not that bad.,"I bought one similar 20G external HD in 2004.At first it worked fine, later it showed the same problems as mentioned in previous posts by other people. There was noise from the i/o operation and it was painfully slow.Sometimes just cannot open any folder.I returned it twice and got it back without any change and without any explanations except a sheet saying nothing was wrong.Later I figured out that for some desktops if I plugged the usb cable to the back panel, then those problems disappeared. So I guess there was not enough power to run it with the front panel usb ports (usually for mouse and keyboard, and mostly usb 1.0), and the usb ports of labtops.Conclusion:1, poor design since it won't work with all usb ports.2, poor interaction with customer, no detail explainations."
1,Avoid this product if you care about your data!,"I bought this portable hard-drive to back-up my important files. Three months later the USB connection broke and now I can't access my files. COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!I guess I need a back-up for my back-up. This is a piece of junk. I cannot describe how disappointed I am at this product. I will never, ever, buy an IOGEAR product again."
1,IOgear ION,"I had a great deal of trouble with this drive. Almost from the beginning, even smallish (5 - 20Mb) digital photo files would become corrupted when they were copied from the main hard disk to this volume. I tried using it with a few different brands of computers, and found it to be generally unreliable as a means of backup. The actual disk inside the unit has since failed completely. In my opinion, this thing was a real piece of trash."
1,PLEASE DON'T BUY ... it is garbage,"PRODUCT SUCKS SO DO THE TECH. SUPPORT. It doesn't work properly with all laptops. ( Dell Inspiron 8600). Error message : Exceeded Power supply limit for the USB HUb. If you call tech support. THEY ARE ARROGANT AND NOT AT ALL HELPFUL. I have another WD passort HDD 120 GB. It is fantastic, works great!!! and it is cheap too."
4,Decent workout - will make you sweat!,This workout is good. Love the energy of Jennifer Lee. Her story is definitely inspirational. Pretty intense though in parts for someone who is just starting a workout routine.
5,Great fun for two players,"This is a lot of fun for two players. Generally most games I've found require at least 3-5 players, and have stripped-down, not-quite-as-fun rules for two players. This game is designed well for two players. There is no combat between the players, only cooperative and competitive play. The individual boards and various pieces make it quite easy to keep track of the various resources in the game. The game has a tutorial that seems confusing at first, but quickly gets you up to speed on how to play the game.A word of warning: The game says it's around 1-2 hours, but I honestly think that unless you're extremely competitive to get the victory points, the game will take much longer than that. That would be my only complaint: you need seriously competitive players to make the game go by quicker.Overall, a fun and involved game. I can see my wife and I playing this game a lot."
5,One of the best adaptations,This game is a great two player adaptation of a Catan style game. Way better than the card game. Comes with a really easy start-up guide. Can't say enough about it.
3,Really Loooong Two player Catan,"Starship Catan has some of the features of all the Catans- resources, upgrades, trading, but it is very different from the other Catan games. The game board and sequence are interesting and unlike the other Catans and the absolute need to buy resources cheap and sell them high is unique among Catan games. Unfortunately, it is easy to run out of things to build and very slow to get victory points. The game says it takes 60 minutes, but the three times we played it were each easily two hours. I'm not sure how I would fix it, but if you are looking for a two player Catan game I recommend the Settlers of Catan Card Game and it's terrific expansion set or the two player directions included with the Traders and Barbarians Expansion of the Classic Catan game."
5,Lots of little pieces!,"It takes awhile to set up the game itself, much like all the other Catan games, but this one is pretty neat looking, visually. We've only played it twice so far. I have a 5 month old, so all the little pieces were very noticible to me. It helps to pick up the boosters and lasers straight up, instead of at an angle like a puzzle piece. It seems to be fun! We'll keep playing to really get the rules down. I was thinking this was the other space game from Catan, but it works because this one is only for two players. (They apparently aren't manufacturing the other game currently.)"
3,Not as good as other Catan games,"We are big fans of Settlers, Cities and Knights, and getting into Traders and Barbarians. It's usually just 2 of us playing (2 players each), so we were excited about Starship Catan. But it has so many little pieces and ways to arrange the cards, the setup is kind of a drag. And the premise is not as intuitive or compelling as Settlers. We've only played it twice in the several months we've owned it.I think on the scale of strategic board games for two, it might rate pretty high. But I'd rather manage 2 players at Settlers than deal with this game."
4,"Adorable and quality video, but wish there was more content.","Our family of cat lovers has watched the show on Animal Planet and are hooked on watching these adorable kittens antics. Though we loved what we saw on the video, we purchased this video expecting more than just the one ""episode."" We were hoping for an entire season of shows. Very happy with the content, just wish there was more of it!"
5,Just too cute for words!,If you love cats you will love this DVD - but - warning - don't get so involved in the DVD that you rush out and buy yourself another kitten! You don't need another kitten! Just enjoy the DVD and hug your old cat.
1,EZ Starter air burush kit,"I was very disappointed when I got my Ez started air brush kit it doesn't look like it does in the picture, it is not as good quality as it shows in the picture and it doesn't have the important features that an artist needs, it is very cheap looking. The picture is very deceiving."
4,Godd beginner airbrush,"This airbrush is sturdy and works well. It's a good tool to learn the fundimentals of airbrush artwork. It comes with a thin black plastic hose that seems to never loose its curled up state. So it's a little annoying. I wish it came with a more flexible hose. Also, better instructions would be good. There is a ""canned air"" adapter that is not identified and it took me a long time to figure out what the heck it was!"
2,junk,"do not buy this gun. it wouldn't pull the paint up through the gun. couldn't get it to work, and broke it trying!!!!"
4,One of the Better Live Albums,"While these may not be some of the best recordings of the Oil's music, its still a must have for Oils fans. You can definitely feel the frenetic energy in the music that Oils shows have become so famous for. Its also a pretty good mix of both old and new stuff, ranging from their first album, ""Powderworks"", to what at the time was their latest, ""Stars of Warburton"". It also includes an extra track - a fantastic version of ""Burnie"". Very nice! The album is a little rough around the edges but its a lot of fun to listen to and the energy is contagious."
1,A BUNCH OF JUNK TUNES AND RECORDINGS,"I BOUGHT THIS CD YEARS AGO FROM A CD CLUB, MAN AM I SORRY.ANYTHING OVER $4.00 FOR THIS ""CUT"" IS TOO MUCH"
4,A book on general VoIP,"This book is a non-technical book on VoIP that explains to the reader what VoIP is and why companies and individuals can benefit from it. It talks about cost saving using VoIP. In my opinion there are 2 benefits from VoIP: cost saving and (extra data-voice) features. The author could have written a bit more about (extra possible convergence) features. If you want a technical book for implementing VoIP, there are others more suited to your needs. The gateway part discussed in another review can be found (theoretically, not practically) in Voice over the packet network from Wright. Mr. Kelly's book was to the point, concise and comprehensable. An excellent primer. The review using a lot of abbreviations and technical terms was not to the point, since it just sums some terms whose meaning can be looked up on for instance wikipedia. The basic function of these terms is discussed in general in this book. (The reviewer sums a lot of Voice codecs for instance.)"
3,VOIP for the Management,"This book is focused on the key elements of telephony and the migration to VOIP - primarily as a cost saving measure. The first 2/3 of the book deal with the VOIP technology - as an adjunct to and eventual replacement for traditional (legacy) telephony. By the 2/3 point, the author is talking about cost analysis, benefits and justification.I would more likely title this book ""VOIP for management"". This is not a put-down or insult, as the book's primary objective is to educate the mostly non-technical person on what VOIP is, and how it might best fit into an existing picture, and one moving forward.Being primarily technical myself, this book was good as a preliminary introduction to a subject that I wasn't familiar with - but I immediately moved on to the O'Reilly books on the subject - ""Switching to VOIP"" by Ted Wallingford and ""Asterisk"" (Leif Madsen, et al). Someone who is responsible for managing such a transition would find it much more useful than I did."
3,Cassette version used,Some value for everyone. Half of the information is only appropriate for a professional speaker. I will not listen a second time.
1,"earplugs, please?","They've completely butchered not only a classic Kansas song, but also my all-time favorite Radiohead song. If you can't write your own music, the least you could do is not recreate songs that don't need recreated to begin with. Some things are definitely better untouched.. or unsung in this case."
2,Didn't BLOW me away with their mediocre vocals....,"These ""opera"" singers sound so much better singing more contemporary/pop style vs. the full-on classical...not they are horrible singers, but you know when you hear a vocal that is just nearly there but still isn't? Most of the track is JUST Ok. Period. If I had known this I would never had wasted my money on this CD. :("
1,Sick!,"Unless, you like seeing the bodies of savagely murdered children or a documentary made by two sick individuals that think three child murderers should be let free, nobody should bother with this rotten film. I was sickened by the police footage that the so-called filmmakers used showing the mutilated bodies of three eight year olds. I was horrified with the titling with crosses in the Os like this is some cheap horror movie. I was digusted with how the filmmakers, apprently gleefully, show child murderers cavorting and primping for the camera. If that's not enough the two filmmaker losers chose to use the favorite music of the convicted killers for the music of their ""film."" The propagandist filmmakers not happy enough with their obvious disgust with the parents of the victims and their Christian religion tried to help create evidence to skew the trial in favor of the murderers! This whole film is just plain grotesque. There is no excuse for it."
4,Riveting!,"Riveting, yes. But I don't agree with those viewers and reviewers who express conviction that there was a gross miscarriage of justice; that the three boys found guilty of the murders are in fact innocent. To be sure, they may well be; ""Paradise Lost"" certainly offers one ample cause to have reasonable doubt. It's important to note, however, that the juries didn't render their verdicts based on the documentary, but on the evidence presented at the trials. While I'm inclined to believe that the boys aren't guilty, that inclination is based on the documentary. It's impossible to know with certainty what verdict I would have rendered had I been a juror at one of the trials. And the same is true of everyone who's expressed a definite judgment(usually in favor of innocence) after viewing the indisputably excellent ""Paradise Lost""."
5,Kangaroo Court,"Think the Salem Witch Trials are a relic of some bygone era of religious zealotry? There are plenty of areas in the present U.S.A that would make Salem proud. Watch ""Paradise Lost"" and witness a justice system built on evidence and reason crumble under the weight of runaway religious hysteria. ""Paradise Lost"" should be required viewing at every high school in the country."
4,Mind boggling,"I first learned about the West Memphis Three when I was working promotions for an album being produced to raise money for their defense effort, after doing some reading I learned of the HBO documentary on this case, and after watching this I was just in a state of shock on how our justice system worked. Since then they have been release, but for anyone that wants an education on the dark side of justice pick up a copy of this and give it a watch."
4,WM3,"I missed this series on HBO but friends had told me how shocking and thought provoking it was. When I saw it on Amazon, I knew I had to have it. Wow. Very well done."
4,Paradise Lost - The documentary,"I saw a blurb about this case on one of my true crime shows a while back. It sparked my interest to find out more. This is an amazing documentation, absolutely frightening and sickening at the same time. But after watching it, I am wondering what happened to these boys? Where are they at in their lives now? A new doc would be interesting I think."
5,Fantastic movie about a real life tradegy,this movie was really interesting. it really hooked me into the story. after viewing i really felt for the families of the children as well as the accused for the lack of a real trial. i suggest this movie to anyone.
5,Absolutely stupendous/disturbing/John Mark Byers is Guilty,"This is by far the best purchase that I have ever made. I knew a lot about the case even before i saw the documentary and it even solidified my confidence in the innocence of Damien, Jason, and Jessie even more after watching the Testimony of Dale Griffis (The mail order doctor. John mark byers is full of crap and because of that he would make an excellent actor in hollywood."
5,Super Film!,"A documentary at its best. This film will leave you questioning our justice system, along with the outcome. A must see movie portaying crime so real. FREE THE WEST MEMPHIS THREE!"
3,"Captivating Film, But it ignores many facts...","This film is a documentary of an incredible triple murder case of three eight year old boys. This film takes the viewer through the trials and convictions of three teenagers. Unfortunately, this movie is all that many people will ever see regarding these murders, and this movie is very biased toward the convicted murderers. Fiber matches linking two of the convicted murderers to the dead boys are glossed over. ...The worst omission, however, was that of a necklace with blood, DNA matched to the murderer on death row as well as two of the victims, found in Echols' trailer. The case is sensational, but this movie is not objective. Read the book, ""The Blood of Innocents,"" in addition to watching this movie to get a more complte view of the case."
1,paradise lost dvd critique,I saw this documentary on HBO and thought it was terrific. It really showed the Justice system at work. I therefore decided that I would like to purchase a copy of this documentary on DVD. I went to Amazon.com and found that Imports.com was selling this DVD. When I received it I played it and couldn't believe the poor quality of it. It was grainy and was in Zoom size setting. The picture was so big that it really didn't fit the frame. It was like watching a movie on an old TV set that was in bad shape. I e-mailed Imports.com with my concerns and they did not respond at all. All I can think is that they get this criticism alot!
3,Very Gripping,"I believe this first film was very gripping. The entire case itself is fascinating , but for the whole truth I think anyone who has seen the first one should see part 2, and if after viewing the second one they still believe that those three teenage (now adults) boys are still guilty then they obviously need to do more research on the case because there is no physical evidence to link these boys to the murders infact there is overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Those guys were convicted based on the clothes they wore, the books they read, and the music they listened to..."
5,Totally Shocking,"This is a true story! Three Young boys from West Memphis, Arkansas are on death row, charged with capitol murder of 3 little boys with absolutly no evidence! They were found guilty soley on the type of music that they listen too and that they wore black clothes. This is a must see. Your heart will go out to these boys and their family."
5,Very important documentary! Great fast and easy service!,"This seller was top notch and this documentary is very important, because it reveals the ugly under belly of our justice system when a proper defense can not be afforded. This is the second time I've purchased these titles, because my previous copies were stolen in a home burglary, but I wanted another copy to have and watch with my wife, who has only just now seen the horrific story.Free the West Memphis Three!"
5,Awesome Handbook!,"Definitely recommended...This quick reference guide is well-laid out and has quite a bit of useful (as well as interesting) information.Not only do you get a lot of information that is easy to understand, but the photos are fantastic as well!I have had my second rabbit for nearly a year now and this is one of the best resources I've found yet."
4,"Great if you need the music, but not necessarily the words..","This book is definitely a must-have if you require the notes to play the tunes. However, if you're only trying to figure out the lyrics, the best way to go about this is to play the ""South Park: BLU DVD"" with the English subtitles on (or captions on if you have it on VHS). Then you can sing along with the movie! Neat, huh? Unfortunately, there's no 'bouncing ball' to follow when the kids do break into song, but hey, you can't have everything!'Late"
2,It's a DVD-R,They don't tell you that this is a DVD-R and it looks like it was recorded at home. Very poor quality.
1,"boring, very boring","This is one lame movie. There is a small amount of nudity. Poor acting. Again, it's a lame movie."
1,I actually had high hopes for high hopes for this movie...,"I rented this movie with my buddies one night cuz it had a hot chick on the front and looked hilariously bad. It turned out to be bad in a bad way. It's a really boring movie that makes you laugh at how stupid it is for the first five minutes, but then just makes you either bored or uncomfortable. The multiple rapings were extremely disturbing and gross. The end is kinda funny but it doesn't make up for how horrid the rest of it is. Despite the fact that Jan Mackenzie is a total hottie, its an awful, awful film."
2,"Found it a really low budjet, low class movie .","This was a very low budjet, low class movie with no known actors or actresses, just family members; the leading lady of this movie always seems to be without her clothes & her husband in real life is the rapist in this."
5,"A fantastic, factual account on rastafari.",I found this work to be one of the most complete on the study of the the Rastafarian movement.The information is well presented and is cohesive and highly informaive. This work is ideal for the new convert or anyone who wants a thorough examination of the faith. I highly recommend it.
3,The Farmer's Wife,I know there have been several versions of this story. I went back a little too far and got a silent movie. My mistake. I would rather have chosen the version made in about 1940.
5,"Chicken is ""little"" no more","As a lover of chicken recipes and collectibles, I believe I have found the perfect book. I've enjoyed every recipe I've tried and can't wait for the lavender in my garden to bloom so I can try the Honey and Lavender Baked Chicken Leg recipe.I found the history of chicken information Ms. Arnaud provides in the book to be absolutely charming."
2,THERE IS NO WAY TO CONTACT THE SELLER,"I am completly dissatisfied with this pourchase. It is nice pen, however, there are no gel refills that fit the pen. My husband only uses the roller ball pens. There is no way to contact the seller through Amazon and on the invoice that was provided in the package had no contact information at all, just my info. Now I am stuck with a pen that will never be used. To top it off I went to Marshalls last week I saw the same exact pen for $10. I paid $30 something for it. I will never buy anything from this seller ever again."
4,Very powerful antenna but delicate with a retro look,"Bought the antenna after purchasing a D ling Rangebooster N desktop adapter DWA-542 (which is lightning fast but has an unstable connection-so beware). This little antenna performs as advertized. As a matter of fact, I can pick up signals 3-4 houses down and from across the street! The only disadvantage that I can think of is that it has a delicate feel to it (I hid it from the kids by placing it in behind the monitor) and that it looks like one of the old style TV antennas (reto look). If you can put up with this I don't think you are going to find a more powerful wireless antenna on the market. The price is also very reasonable (I paid over $50 for the Rangebooster N desktop adapter)."
1,dead usless,"do not buy this product. its a fakedose not kill virus. it pretends it kill itthen the customer service of stop zilla and the tech support of stopzilla is rude as hell making demands or elsethen I get pissed. and yell at them about paying for my computer. paying for my taxes and paying for my pay role,.are you paying for that??? Then I hang up I called 3 times on each department what a waste of time and moneyDo not think Norton is a better buy? think again.Norton dose not work. instead delete files that is not allowed to delete. then windows dose not boot up.I gone though two brand names that cannot do a darn thing rightno use talking to Norton about it. its wasting my time."
4,very nice,"It is very easy to install, also like that it can move to the sides if need too, the only thing I would say that I did not like is once the tv is mounted and you tilt it down the screws to secure is not easy to acces."
1,Boring,"I didn't care for this game at all. The fighting was tedious, and grew old after one minute. i didn't care if I could get better armor or weapons. It was like a bad boxing game with gladiators instead. If you want fun, check out God of War or Shadow of the Colossus."
2,Good but flawed,"I have to agree with the previous review in that this is a badly censored game, although it's still highly playable. You can take a few paths in the games and fight literally hundreds of battles, there is alot of different weapons and armour to collect, although it is really cheap, you can get mostly any weapon/armour on your second day.I've never played the Japanese version but I imagine it would be much more satifying without the changes. Still worth playing though, but it does feel as if things have been changed when they shoud't have. Just my opinion."
1,Great game ruined by censorship and dumbing down.,"Colosseum WAS a great game in the Japanese version, you could fight many great battles and save up for very expensive but powerful armor. You could also hack the limbs of people including decapitaion.All of this has gone now.The American version has incredibly cheap armor and items ruining the point of saving up to get that high level armor or weapon. You cannot inflict limb severing damage even if you hit someones bare neck with a huge attack.A dreadful shame that this game has been so literally butchered. Get the Japanese version if you can."
4,"Colosseum is fun, but not great","Colosseum is a game i picked up at blockbuster for 7 bucks. when i played it, i fell in love with the game,but noticed some flaws. it had great combat, good voilence effects, great weapon variety, but that is about it. you play as a glatiator who fights for his freedom. as you win fights, you become more popular and gain better living conditions. you need to train every other day and hone your abilities, then the next day,fight. the game is highly repetitive, but nevertheless, fun-willh09"
3,Good though not their best work,"Over The Rhine is a band that crosses many boundaries. They are Americana mixed with bar room jazz and a bit of country while having a splash of Louisiana sultry. This is one of their earlier efforts and while worth of purchase as part of a collection, would best be passed over in favor of Eve, Amateur Shortwave Radio, or Besides if you are looking for a sampling of their early years. Their early years featured Ric Hordinski on guitar who, for those who do not know of him, is quite accomplished. Their early sound has a wonderful blend of guitar, synth, excellent writing, and of course, the angelic voice of Karin Bergquist. This is a band I would recommend to anyone with refined musical taste. This is not a garage band. This is a professional group of musicians trying to make the music that only they could put together."
4,Positive Crankcase Valve for Ranger,"Does what it's supposed to, doesn't complain about it; best traits for car parts. Puts the seat down, picks up after itself, and does the dishes on occasion. Oh wait, it's a car part so it doesn't do any of that. Still works tho."
2,Buyer Beware,"Considering the date this was recorded I was expecting a somewhat flat sound, maybe even some surface noise etc. But this is merely a recording lifted direct from the movie itself, including all the interrupting dialogue and sound effects (where the music fades in the back ground). It is not as another review states, tracks preceded by a bit of introductory dialogue. All the delicious underscoring leading into the wondrous musical numbers that I heard faintly in the movie I now can also here FAINTLY in this Cd. As with other 'lifted' soundtracks on the market the sound suffers from being so removed from the original source elements. The result is crackly, muffles music that dare not be played too loud. This was disappointing as Membran is usually top notch with their soundtrack offerings. I don't like to leave negative reviews, but sometimes more complete product info is helpful, as I would certainly not have bought this if I had known. My advice is to get the movie instead."
2,Straight Leg? I don't think so,"I can never find jeans to fit, but these fit in the waist and behind very well. But their idea of straight leg and my idea of straight leg are 2 different things. Instead of hugging the leg and tapering all the way to the ankle like ""straight leg"" would imply, they are about 2 inches wider than my thigh and stay that way all the way down. I suppose if I were 30 years younger that could work, but I'm not, and it doesn't. Guess it's off to my zShop for these!"
2,jeans review,"size was misleading. after having tried on the jeans locally, I purchased these jeans at a great price but the same size was very tight. I like the jeans but wiery of buying online"
1,This Music Sux Ass,"he tricked me i thought i was getting a good album, but instead got sum trash that sounded like it was made on an african slave boat, f**k kilo...he is a no good filthy broke ex-con!! Oh yea, how that moped scooter doin on gas???"
5,The greatest recording of this opera,"An opera-loving friend of mine counts this recording as the finest ever made of Massenet's Manon. He wrote: ""If you don't mind ""historic"" monaural sound, the 1929 recording with Rogatchewsky and Feraldy, conducted by Elie Cohen, has both superb vocalism and a wonderful sense of atmosphere about it."""
4,Pocket Adventures!,"We're about to order The Iceland Wyrm, so this review is for the series overall so far as we've encountered it. As the first reviewer noted, this series is not (yet) prominent in the U.S. and we found The Dragon Star entirely by accident in Ireland on a recent visit. It's FABULOUS!! In the tradition of the 'pick-your-own' sorts of adventures, it provides a great whopping adventure with fine good humor. Mr. Steer has a good ear for a kid's tale and an excellent sense of twists of fate. It's been rated a double-thumbs up in our house by no less than 5 boys of ages 5 to 7 and an equal hearty rating by the adults who read it out loud. Did you enjoy Dr. Drake's straightforward dragon-taming books? Then you'll enjoy this series' twists and turns and further exploits of the SASD."
5,The self-taught communicator,"For anyone who enjoys the process of writing and speaking, this book is a great treat. Lincoln carefully selected words for their mental and emotional impact. And he seems to have gotten better every year. Very inspiring!"
3,Misshapened Free Association,"Somewhere in The Gift Horse by Hildegard Knef there is a story struggling to be told. Unfortunately, as a result of the author's free associating, the lack of a firm editorial hand, or a somewhat inept translator (David Anthony Palastanga), it doesn't emerge successfully. Knef meanders back and forth through her life, ignoring pedestrian chronology, resorting to unedited journal notes at times, and imposing a brain dump onto the poor reader. This is too bad as her life is an impressive story. It's a shame."
4,much cooler now,"The battery insulation kit has worked well, my battery is in back by the firewall a very hot area, also by exhaust manifold. Idiot design that kills batteries from Ford. The material keeps battery much cooler which will extend its life. Heat is the killer of batteries."
4,Nice - Functional Sculpting Wheel,"I agree with the other reviewers. This is a great wheel; ball bearings sound solid and the wheel rotates smoothly. My only addition would be that the picture of the item is not what the wheel looks like (at least mine does not). The dimensions are correct but the Formica with the stone look on top is deceptive. My surfaces were a dark grey, both on top and below. Though my wheel does not look as nice as the one pictured on the site, I give it 4 stars for performance."
3,Toby,Ok but I have heard better but his sound and presentation are fairly good so I have rated him OK
5,Toby Keith 10,This is a great dvd for any one who likes Toby Keith. We enjoy being able to see & hear the songs & really puts you in a good mood.
5,''Left my wife weak in the knees',My wife is a huge Toby Keith fan so when I saw this DVD was available at Amazon I jumped on it. She loved it. All you Toby Keith fans should check this one out.
2,This is not a CD,"While I love Toby Keith and all these songs, I was looking for a CD of his music, not a DVD that doesn't work in my car etc. It would've been nice to know these are just music videos."
3,Strange career move.......,"I recently bought the collection by Juice. This is the second attempt at re-recording past hits. I honestly do not see the point at doing them again..... New material is always more welcomed in my opinion. I have been a fan of Juice Newton since the early days, and I have to say that this is the first cd that I have been disappointed with. Juice is not the problem here. She is in great voice as always. The songs are great songs. The production is the problem. Also, I noticed this collection is by Madacy. Their collections are usually at best mediocre. All of the recordings sound like demos. Juice is still my favorite female artist. I just hope that she will return soon with new material. Her new look is great, and It would be nice to see her get the recognition she so much deserves in the music industry. I know she still has some incredible recordings to deliver."
1,Poor Product,"A lot of problems with Philips Plasma TV's, Customer service is even worse.I would stay away from this company and it's products...."
5,A suffocating Bass Rococo,Tchaikovsky's Rococo is the most important piece in this CD. The slow variations make you believe that this piece should have been written for bass but not cello. Badila's Bottesini maybe isn't the best recording. But his Rococo is unparalleled.
3,fast fast fast,another example of technique over musicianship. Not the best recordings of the Bottesini works. See Furtok's CD for a better performance.
2,Don't expect much...,"First off let me admit that the Horror genre is not a favorite of mine. I do, however, try to read a variety of works from various genres to stay well rounded. This book was a real disappointment to me personally. I found the whole thing fanciful and unbelievable. From the dog that should have been cast for a Lassie remake (What Lassie? Uncle Frank has fallen down an old mineshaft and we need approximately fifteen feet of rope to free him. Is that what you are trying to tell us, boy?) to the little girl who sounds way too much like an adult trying to imitate a small child and failing miserably, I found the book difficult to believe.I would only recommend this book (I have not read anything else by Carlene Thompson) if you have the ability to put aside serious unrealistic elements and can enjoy a book only for the sum of its parts, not the parts themselves."
3,don't close your eyes,i have read most of this author's books and i have to say i was a little dissappointed.
3,Long-winded and a minor disappointment,This was my second Thompson book and felt it was neverending. The ending was somewhat disappointing and I was glad to finally finish the darn thing!
4,"Solid, enjoyable mystery","I had never read this author but was intrigued by the cover and synopsis. Looking for a light book to take on vacation, I took a chance. I found it to be a very compelling and suspenseful book. This author has quite a talent for scaring the daylights out of you without bogging you down with a lot of graphic violence. I figured out who the killer was fairly early, but I always do; so I don't hold that against the author. She did a great job of hiding her villain. I would have liked to see a little more romance between Natalie and the sherriff but was glad that Ms. Thompson doesn't feel the need to include gratuitous sex in her novels. I would definitely recommend this book to those who enjoy this genre. I was intrigued enough to seek out some of her other novels."
5,Don't Close Your Eyes Book,"Excellent book, suspenseful, a definite page turner. This book is among the many well written books by Carlene Thompson. She has become my favorite author as she satisfies my strong desire for intrigue, along with a bit of romance. All of her books keep me guessing until the end. Her portrayal of characters make them come to life for the reader. Received in perfect condition, and quick and easy transaction."
5,Very well written and compelling,"I liked 8 or 9 of Carlene Thompsons novels. Was really disappointed with ""If you ever tell"" and ""Since you've been gone"", found both books very confusing with too many characters.If you want to give Thompson a chance, start with ""All fall down"". I think it's even better than her first book ""Black for Remembrance"", because it creates such a great atmosphere.""The way you look tonight"" and ""In the Event of my Death"" are excellent.""Don't close your eyes"" is very well written.""If she should die"" has a very slow beginning, but after almost 100 pages it picks up and develops a humorous relationship between the main character, Christine Ireland, and the new sheriff which really cracked me up.""Last Whisper"" was very thrilling and recommendable.""Share no Secrets"" and ""Last seen alive"" are not bad, but not among her better ones.I still need to read ""You can run"", so I cannot say anything about that one."
1,Cingular 2125 is the Worst cell phone I ever had it,"It is useless. Spend you money on a better phone. The manual sent with the phone doesn't explain anything. You cannot hear the phone ringing, the volume is very low and you cannot increase."
4,good nutrition lesson,This is a good book for people who need to learn good nutrition basics. Easy and fun to read and very easy to understand. I especially liked the brand recomendations.
5,"simple, EZ, & easy to read","The book gives me a weight loss PLAN. Not, some crazy diet. A easy to understand guide (not diet) to lose weight and keep it off. She outlines the way to eat & lose weight. The author is smart but uses simple words, ideas, and a plan. This is not some flimsy paperback. She hits the nail on the head. My wife read the book & says ""I have already lost pounds"" by eating by the plan. ( she will not tell me the number of pounds???)"
2,I am missing soemthing with the Jane Austen comparison!,"What do these 3 whiny selfish sisters have to do with Austen's classis sparkling comedy of manners? Mrs. Bennett was neither cold nor bullying of her brood of British daughters? The characters in Pride and Prejudice are likable unlike this horror. I was delighted to pick this up, but it turned out to be so disappointing.The sisters and their mother, ""Doc"". are so thinly drawn. The author labels each one and we never see beyond that. The mother was so exaggerated she could never garner any sympathy. The men from the father to the assorted husband/boyfriend/fiance types were also like paper dolls, nothing was there. I never cared about these people.If you want a book about marriage and sister, reread Jane Austen!"
2,Jane Austen comparisons are unfounded!,"I couldn't even finish this slow-moving, drab, dull book. I tried to, really I did, but I realized I had already wasted way too much precious time on it already! Needless to say, I would NOT recommend this book to anyone."
3,Good not great,"Compared to their other albums, Shape of Time is is pretty ho hum. It sounds to electronic. aIt doesn't have the mystic smooth earthy tones many of their other releases are famous for. Its OK but not Oldmans best effort."
2,Not a complete waste of time but almost,"First thing I did was to look under the ""Mercury"" entry to check the author's credentials. Not a single reference to the mind or the intellect. Enough said...... a really basic alchemic piece of ""green language"" that had been undecyphered by the author.And the list of errors and crucial missed definitions goes on and on and on."
4,another good one out of print...,....easy-to-use dictionarylike reference book on alchemical symbolism. Pick it up if you see it somewhere. Not hugely comprehensive but a good quick resource.
2,"Dense and opaque, but with some interesting parts.","I gather from reading this book that the author has developed and previously published some theoretical or psychological model for analyzing religions. In this volume, he applies his analytical approach to the question of whether Freemasonry is a religion, which seems appropriate enough given Freemasonry's ritual and esoteric content. His explanation of his model and its jargon is even more impenetrable than the jargon itself. His discussion of his results suffers accordingly. The book becomes a bit more worthwhile in discussing why men join the fraternity (at least in England where his research was done), why they stay, who they are, what they get out of it, and what they do behind those closed doors. His unsurprising conclusion, as near as I can tell, is the same answer you would get by asking any random Freemason whether the fraternity was a religion.(This book was originally published in hardcover under the title ""Who's Afraid of Freemasons?""."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!,"Without doubt this is the worst book I have ever read on any subject. It actually hurt to read the entire thing. I've been a Freemason for 17 years and I've never read anything so confusing and nonsensical in my Masonic life. The author's title makes the reader believe that perhaps the author will be attempting to answer the title question, but in fact, that question is never even addressed. So much time is spent trying to explain the author's theory on religion and make the author look good, that no space is left for the him to address his title question, and thus the work suffers greatly. The editor of this books should lose his job it is so poorly done, and Mr. Piatigorsky should be reevaluated in his professorship. I was sorely disappointed with this book and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. In fact, I would recommend people avoid it as though it had the Plague."
2,There are better books on the subject,"Judging by the title I thought this was going to be a book trying to debunk the conspiratorial viewpoint many have about Freemasonry. Its actually a mix of mainstream Masonic history and blue lodge level Masonic ""secret"" rituals, symbology and oaths with the authors spin and opinions on them. Overall most of this book is boring but you get some decent history and some of their so called ""secrets"" but there is nothing in this that hasn't been presented better in other books."
5,k/v is the best,"This workout stacks up to every k/v workout - the cardio is low impact, meaning you will get a harder workout by making your moves bigger - and the strength portions continue to challenge me as I increase the amount of weight I'm using. BUT what I LOVE about karen is that her transitions are so natural, her movements are total body movements, nothing ""jerky"" or ""bouncy."" Her instruction is absolutely the best I've found, she tells you exactly how to get the MOST out of every move ... and the epitome of every Karen Voight workout is a deep muscle stretch at the end that makes it all worth it. This is a good workout - it's not as challenging as Energy Sprint, but it's challenging in a different way. This is a great total workout that requires only some free weights and good shoes."
5,One of the only videos you will need!,"The trouble with most videos these days (yoga, pilates, etc) is that there isn't enough cardio, so all that beautiful muscle could stay hidden a layer of fat! And many of the videos that claim to be ""cardio"" are only about 25 minutes long.My first Karen Voight video was 'Your Personal Best' (w/ Elle McPherson) and I really liked the circuit training approach. She carries that through into this video. Circuit training is great because just when you're about to collapse, it's time to stop and do weights. This is an excellent intermediate workout!"
5,Very Pleased with this DVD!,"Karen Voight is fantastic. I used to work out to Your Personal Best Workout when I was in college and loved her video. I had forgotten how easy she is to follow and and simply complex the moves are. Great work out! I love that I can choose a short or long workout and if I'm really short on time, I can just do cardio. Definitely purchase this one!"
5,excellent and effective workout,"this is a terrific workout - it is effective and i can always get myself to do it. on days i am tired i take it down a notch by just not giving it my all, and on days when I really want a workout its easy to make myself sweat if I want with this routine."
4,Excellent total body workout video for the week when we have less time and less energy.,This is an excellent 45 min only total body workout and it's great and efficient. It's fun and you will get the sweat and workout you need! I love doing this video during the week when I might not have the same energy and motivation then on the week-end.
2,Surprisingly dissapointing,"This is not the best Karen has done. First of all, the music is horrendous. The workout itself is okay, not anything to write home about. I like The Firm much better. Will be sticking with that.."
5,Great beginner to intermediate workout!,"Karen is great. I've never done aerobics, jazzercise, etc., because I hate all those fluff-chicks whooping and yelling. Karen does not chatter, just gives the cues and some hints. All her movements are very controlled. It never felt bouncy and dancey, a good thing! She adds a few hops here and there, but if that's too much impact, just bounce and don't let your feet leave the floor. Being new to all this, I worked up a good sweat! The ab portion is an absolute killer. I love that I can jump around between circuits and that I only need hand weights. Just starting a new workout, I didn't want to invest too much. And you don't need much room for this workout, either. I do half of the workouts one day and the other half the next to stretch it out so I don't get bored. I couldn't make out much of the music, just a continuous beat in the background. Or maybe I was just concentrating more on the moves. Enjoy."
5,New to Karen Voight,"I've heard of Karen Voight for years, but never got around to doing one of her videos. One day when I was in the store I came across this video and got it.The next day I did the video and loved it. Karen it great at cuing and isn't annoying like a lot fitness instructors. She explains the moves and doesn't bore you with useless chat. It's also a great video for people who have bad knees like myself. You can increase the intensity by using heavier weights or lower it by not adding on additional moves.It also has a varity of combonations on the DVD. You can chose to do the whole circut, double circut, just cardio, or just toning. Which is great for the days I don't feel like working for 45 mins or when I need more of workout I can do that as well.If you have never tried a Karen Voight video before I suggests getting this one."
2,Owners of Sleek Pysique Beware!,"As far as the workout goes, it's good. It gets your heart going and tones your muscles. My problem is with the honesty of re-packaging the exact same workout and selling it under two seperate titles! There is no indication given in the descriptin of the two DVD's that they contain the same footage and I bought this one thinking I was getting a ""new"" workout...a change. I guess Karen Voight needed the money. Too bad she lost my trust."
4,Burn and Firm,Great workout! The time flies by. I have many Karen Voight work outs. They are all worth having. She is instructional and inspiring. Buy it!!
3,Not her best workout,"I dislike having to give Karen Voight a negative review, but ... the music was really, really bad; actually, the music is pretty much always bad (except in Cardio Circuit Training), but she's such a super instructor, and the workouts are so well thought out, that I don't notice. That's not the case with the music behind Burn & Firm. To be completely fair, this workout is perfectly well-rounded for 30 minutes, with intense bursts of high rep weights and interval cardio segments (only four, though). I just didn't have fun doing it! Her other tapes are wonderful, i.e. Energy Sprint, Cardio Ciruit Training (fun step routines), and Personal Best. All in all, Karen Voight rocks!"
3,fair,"This workout is as advertised but the aerobics are quite high impact and the production set could use improving.One feels as though many muscles are being worked, but none quite thoroughly enough to actually ""do "" anything.I like Ms Voight's personality and teaching style and she certainly has the physique to die for but the production quality and style of the workouts are mediocre.I prefer both the Firm and Cathe,having found that Ms Voights tapes sit gathering dust as there are better tapes out there."
3,"Great toning sections, harder-to-follow cardio","I liked the idea of circuit training with this DVD. The toning sections were easy-to-follow and thorough. However, the cardio sections were hard-to-follow, especially if you were not very coordinated like me! Worth the value though for what I paid."
3,A bit complicated,"I love workout dvd's and I use them 5-6 times a week. This one is the most difficult to follow that I have. It keeps me interested, though, because I have to concentrate so hard to try to keep up with the intricate sequences she uses during the cardio segments. The first time I did this, I felt like I didn't get a great cardio workout because I kept getting lost with her intricate steps. Granted, I am not the most coordinated person and have never been a dancer. Maybe someone with a little background in dance would keep up better than me. As I have continued to use the dvd, though, I know the moves a bit better, so I do like it because it is quite varied and keeps me interested. Not my favorite workout dvd, but a good one to have if you're like me and do dvd's on a regular basis. It's definitely different than anything else I have."
5,Awesome workout!!,I am a huge Karen Voight fan. This workout is awesome and it never gets old. Just when you need a break from one circuit it changes to another. I would highly recommend this video. It is a good beginner to intermediate video.
3,fun but not too challenging,"I thought I was an beginer/inter. when I bought this Dvd but I feel like the 45min circut workout wasn't hard enough for me. I haven't worked out to a vidoe for 6+ mo. I work out with free weighs (3lbs) and do basic leg exrcises, nothing hard. It is the next day and my arms are a little sore but that's it. I want to loose body fat I don't feel like my heart rate was up long enough to do that effectly. After I was done I felt like I could go on and do it all over again. I wish that the cardio was a little more intence. I was hoping for something that would challenge me more. However, I had a lot of fun doing this dvd so I will probably just do the cardio when I don't have time to do anything else."
3,"Good Workout, Hard To Follow","I love Karen Voight for her laid back (not annoyingly perky) personality and her excellent cuing, but some of the routines were insane! As soon as I got into the groove of a combo, she'd keep adding on to it until it was impossible to follow! I'd either keep doing the basic combo or turn the damn thing off b/c I was so frustrated. The weight lifting segment is effective and the ab workout is killer! The stretching segment was ridiculous if you're not extremely flexible. Overall good, but definately not for beginners."
3,Not for serious weight work-out,"I actually have this tape and have done it a few times. I wouldn't recommend it for a serious workout. Not heavy enough weight is used and the set and music wasn't anything I like either. I would recommend instead the newest ""The Firm"" tapes which you can ""up"" the weight on as you improve. I have numerous Firm tapes and rotate them regularly. You absolutely have to use heavier weights as the weight becomes easier or your body will adjust and quit making improvements. You have to get out of your comfort zone if you want to reshape your body!"
3,Buy the Combo Instead,"The rountines are easy to follow and worth the purchase, but save yourself some money and buy Sleek Physique instead. Sleek Physique includes the material from this DVD plus the material from Yoga Focus (yoga strength and stretch) and is only nominally more expensive."
2,not a great potency,"Red Marine Algae is good for virus type things. I was on a hunt for the best price/best quality and I didn't find it here. So far Swanson's is the best quality/best price. Swanson has a relationship with the Japanese and I think they have an ""in"" for better products from there."
4,good for your immune system,I had a cold/allergy for a long time but decided to try red marine algae: right now I don't even remember that I had cold.This plant makes miracles.
1,No impovement,"I have been taking the red marine algae for 1 month daily per instructions, there is no improvement or relief from the herpes virus breakouts. The shipping cost was much as the product with NO results, don't waste your money!"
4,This CD has a great variety!,"Every time I pick a CD to play, this one comes to mind first! The variety of the songs is fantastic, and all of them with a lively ""steppin'"" beat! It includes alot of my favorite country dance tunes, and some that I hadn't heard before, but I'm sure glad I have now! This is great music if you're doing housework, walking, anything where you need to feel energized. But don't expect to sit still with this in your player!"
4,A must for old engines,Good product. A lot of information about all motor details. Maintenance and repair can be done properly. Texts are well explained.
5,I Love It,I have not opened this product as of yet but I viewed it on TV and liked it so much that I bought it. I have never seen or heard of the Christmas in Boston one so will have to watch that soon. I absolutely adored Snowglobe
4,Liked,I liked this dvd. It was a family dvd and a family would definitely enjoy it. Good for all ages.
3,"Great Movies, Terrible DVD Quality","I purchased this DVD because I love the movies, but the quality of the picture was terrible! The video looked grainy, I couldn't get the picture to adjust to the screen right, and the colors were off. It was definitely not HD quality like I am used to seeing on ABC Family. I played them on my brand new blu-ray player which has played other DVDs just fine, so I don't think the quality was because of the player I used. I was disappointed with the DVD and think it was cheaply made."
2,Huh....I have a collection very similar to this......,"I have a Christmas video collection very similar to this, except the titles are ""Santa's Making Babies""/""Christmas Orgy in Boston"" and ""Look at my Huge Snowglobes"". My buddy Sgt ""old as dirt"" Mikey from Germany recommended them to me, as he is a Christmas movie freak. I have a feeling ol Sgt Mikey is yanking our chain with his review---we all know what he's really watching down in the that man cave amidst his Zagnut bars, Diet Rite colas and his lotions......"
4,"Really, Really Good","Ok, to be honest, I thought the whole Dragonlance series started to go downhill with The Second Generation, and especially Dragons of Summer Flame. But the War of Souls trillogy was quite good and now this first novel in the Dark Desciple series is beginning to make me remember why I loved the whole Dragonlance world to begin with.The charactors are typical Weis, that is to say, memorable and believable. The plot is somewhat darker than you might be used to, but it is well written and generally moves the story along at a nice pace.If you are a fan of the Dragonlance setting, you will no doubt enjoy this book. New charactors are great and it's nice to see some of the other 'minor' gods becoming more and more a part of the world. I am looking foreward to the next book and I absolutely recommend this book. It is well worth your time."
3,Too many syntax errors,"While I love the story, I found the amount of textual errors to be distracting. Really need to fire the proofreaders on this one. I sincerely hope the next book is better."
4,Pretty good so far...,"I am still in the process of reading this book, and I think its a pretty good read so far. I have just discovered the Dragonlance books and will definitely read the others. It's different, the things that struck me the most were the bits of humor tossed in there that seemed out of place and didn't quite fit the fantasy theme; another thing was how commonplace Weis made the gods seem, they weren't very 'godlike' at all. The relationship between Mina and the death god was interesting, it seemed kinda odd though, how she just went straight to serving another dark god, I'll keep reading and see how the story turns out....."
3,I agree with the reviewer...,"... who wanted to give this book 2 1/2 stars!This is an okay book if you need a quick non-taxing fantasy fix before bedtime - and therein lies the problem: it reads just as quickly as it seems to have been written!The characters are flat and unengaging except for Mina who is outright annoying. She has apparently escaped from her Takhisis-experience unchanged and unscathed - no, I take that back! She must have taken one too many hits to the head because she throws in her lot with yet another dark deity. Or maybe she's just stupid.This could have been an interesting book if it had at least explored the dynamics between Chemosh and Mina and truly developed their relationship. He supposedly falls in love with her, but as I see it, she is just a sex slave, without will or personality. I don't understand how any god could find that attractive.Oh well, I guess this whole effort is mostly about the authors being attracted by the God of Money!"
3,Not one of the best DL Books,"Firstly I must say I'm not an native English Speaker. I enjoy reading Fantasy Literature and read almost every book by MW and TH in the Dragonlance Setting (also some other books from the same setting). I enjoy the writing style of Margaret Weis because it is fluent and let you immerse yourself in the story.I must say, I agree with the ""Sex Zombies"" review. This book is clearly not about the stories of heroism, valor, sacrifice and magic. It has more an Forgotten Realms feeling and the frequent interaction between characters and gods make the appereance of the gods an usual event.Still I can recommend this a book as an nice Summer reading. You won't regret reading this book, if you don't expect much from it."
4,Good book,"The book itself starts off slow and the main reasoning for that is because it must lay the foundation for the rest of the story arc which will take place in Amber and Iron as well as Amber and Blood. I found this book absolutely enthralling because it further expands on Mina as a character that you can loathe or love. After the defeat of Tahksis in the War of Souls, Mina turns to Chemosh. The main reasoning for this is because she wants to fill the void that has been left by Tahksis and we all know Chemosh as a tricky and capricious god. I find the active roles that the other gods are playing to be exciting as well as refreshing. In all previous books the gods never took a real active role in shaping the world, simply because there was no need to with mortals doing all the shaping for them. Because of Tahksis' betrayal, that has all been changed. Now they work together with mortals to rebuild their world that the Dragon Overlords ruined."
5,Dragonlance told by the best,"Once again Margaret Weis continues to weave a wonderful web on the world of Krynn, picking up where she left off in ""Dragons of a Vanished Moon"" while introducing a whole new set of characters as well. Just as in all her books, she writes an ending to the book that just makes you wish you had the next volume already at hand!"
1,Disappointing....so far,"I just returned to reading anything ""Dragonlance"" after a long departure and selected this to start. I'm disappointed to say the least. I'm only a hundred or so pages into it and hope I can finish. But, there is nothing happening. Nothing that makes me want to pick it up. Not like I remembered from earlier series when I couldn't wait for the next volume. Here's hoping it gets better."
5,long live Dragonlance,"Well, after waiting the last 2 months for this book to be released, I finished it. I told myself I was going to read it slowly...not a chance. I found the book to be excellent, it takes on a different angle than the other ones. Without giving too much away, it appears that the Gods are the main plot. You'll find yourself cheering for one person, and then it shifts to another.... it definately keeps you from putting it down. There is one moment in the book, that made my face light up.. and that was one of the best characters to have along....... a kender.. and of course this one isn't a 'typical' kender either... Thanks MargaretThe only bad thing I have to say, is... waiting another year for the 2nd one to arrive"
5,a great addition,I was skepticall about this book for a long time and then I finally decided to give it a try.I am very glad that I gave this book a chance.I have read many reviews about it and alot of people seem to think this book is boring and unfulfilling.I know everyone it titled to there opinion but this is a story you need to learn how to read between the lines.Just open your imaginations and you will find this book as wonderfull as I do.I have yet to be dissapointed by any book in the Dragonlance series.
4,"Author, Darrien Lee Calls This Story....EYE OPENING!","Michael Holmes brings to his readers the in and outs of the dangers our law enforcement officers face every day. It shows how easily your life can spiral out of control from a chain of unfortunate and unexpected events. If you think if couldn't happen to you, you're wrong. Michael's story had me living this story as I read it. I felt the anxiety, the fear and sadness that surrounded him. This is a must read, for Michael is an exceptional man with an exceptional story to tell. Of the souls who was caught up in the enticing world of fast money, Michael was not only lucky, but blessed. Don't think it can't happen to you. THIS IS A MUST READ! Keep up the good work Michael!"
4,Interesting Reading,"I truly enjoyed this book. Although I had many questions but after meeting and listening to the author at the Circle of Friends Book Club meeting, I was begin to understand why some of things that happen and how careful he was in changing some things, but able to give a true account of what happen. Very good book, a good read and it's based on a true story I applaud Mr. Holmes for the courage to tell his story. Any men or women in law enforcement this is a must read. Continue writing Mr. Holmes I look forward to your next book and please don't forget the COF II Book Club Atlanta, Ga. We are truly grateful you took time of your busy schedule to share your story with us."
3,Not what I thought I purchased- I got less,"The game itself is fine, but I thought it would come in the case with the instruction booklet, as I paid full price for it. The game card insert only, was sent, wrapped in plastic and stuck in an envelope. No outer casing and no booklet. I was anxious to get the game, so I kept it and figured it out myself, but I don't think I'd buy from this seller again, as a result."
4,Pretty decent case.,"This case does what it is supposed to do: protect the camera. It has a velcro tie-down strap which would work with various camera sizes. It also has a section to store accessories (such as a spare battery, memory card, or cable). Well worth the price."
2,functional but...,"I got this case for my kodak easy share camera, it's a little big and the camera slides around inside a little bit. Also, there's a storage compartment that I've been keeping a dust rag in to wipe the screen and it always gets loose and is floating around with my camera, I'm afraid to put the charger or anything hard in there because I don't want to scratch the finish."
2,Way Too Big -- What's the Point?,"I got a Kodak V603 'ultra portable', extra light, extra slim, POCKET SIZED camera because I wanted to do exactly that -- put it in my pocket to shoot pics on the fly and not lug around extra girth.So um..what exactly is the point of getting this camera case that is literally 3 times bigger in every dimension than the camera itself?It's an attractive case but WAY too big and bulky.My Creative Zen 30GB MP3 player case (also bought on Amazon) or even my T-Mobile Wing case fits my Kodak V603 camera better than this camera case.This seems to be a typical quandary for ultra-portable digicam owners i.e. finding a case that fits perfectly and maintains the integrity and portabilitty of your original purchase (that would be the camera).My advice is to get resourceful and 'repurpose' cases designed for other products.I think for now that is your best bet."
4,Works well,"works well for the Kodak M863, it isn't too small and it is large enough to keep extra memory cards or batteries. It is too big to put in a pocket but works fine to put in your purse."
3,Larger than what I expected,"I'm a little disappointed in the size of this case. I really wanted something smaller, its too bulky for my purse. I do use it in my beach bag and it provides good protection from sand and other things floating around in my beach bag but I don't care for the size of it for my every day purse."
4,Substantiated Conspiracy Theory,"The book was the proper length for the evidence put forth, although the final chapters were somewhat repetitive. Excellent description of the JN-25 system. This title belongs on the shelf of any historian interested in the US entry into WWII. That JN-25 had been read by the British had appeared previously, notably in the book ""And I Was There"" by Admiral Layton and have been ignored by mainstream historians. ""Betrayal"" forces the reader to reconsider the manipulations of the British whose conduct was clearly cost US lives. Continued British lying and secrecy surrounding the issue indicates that England wishes to wait for the WWII generation to quietly pass from the scene before they come clean."
4,Introduction to Superconducting Accelerator Magnets,"The book is an excellent introduction into the rather special field of superconducting accelerator magnets. All key aspects of NbTi dipole and quadrupole magnets are described by experts with practical experience.Starting with an introduction into low temperature superconductivity and accelerator physics the book describes NbTi superconductor manufacturing, magnetic field calculations including persistent current effects, cryogenic implications of superconducting magnets, magnet manufacturing and the measuring techniques to verify magnet performance. For the experts the book also contains some useful tables on material properties relevant for the manufacturing and operation of superconducting magnets.In summary the book presents a lot of useful information in a very concise and easy to understand way. The book is highly recommended."
3,Overdramatic,"The film is simply over the top. For a drama, the characters are two dimensional. For an action film, the action is shown mostly through editing. What happened to the good ole Jet Li days where actions were full framed and crisp."
3,Epic stretches of tedium between the battles.,"Beautifully made with some fine action sequences and good performances. Unfortunately, it becomes tedious for epic stretches between the battles."
4,The Warlords,"The Warlords was everything one would expcet from Jet Lee, Andy Lau,and Takeshi Kaneshiro,film, but I would have liked the option to have viewed it in the English language as I am visually impaired and trying to keep up with the subtitles without having to go back was a bit much."
3,OK Movie,This movie was OK but nothing compared to other classic eastern war films like Red Cliff. The acting was good but the story drags a bit and is not really engaging.
4,Its a good movie,I enjoyed watching Warlords and Jet Li never disappoints when it comes to Kung Fu fights and battle field tactics.A great around film and one that I would recommend. Side bonus it is in English no subtitles needed.
4,One of the better later Jet Li films,This ranks up with Hero and Fearless. Its actually a little better than both of those in some spots a little slow here and there but really a good movie. You will be amazed with it.
3,scenes and action decent,"I liked the scenes, the sets, the costumes, the action sequences, etc. The story line suffers a little bit because of translation. I am fine with subtitles, but I think they suck the story down a bit and pull out some of the emotion that is surely there in the original language film. If I spoke the native language or if this were redone in english I would likely rate it higher."
3,Decent movie,Overall I was not as impressed as I thought I would be. It was much slower than I thought it would be. To the point of boring at times. Still a good movie though.
2,A sleeper for sure,"I came with hi hopes and even expectations of a quality martial arts film. It wasn't even close. it's just a slow moving, non engaging movie which, if one cared enough, would notice the plot didn't make much sense. Save your money."
3,The Warlords or how to doublecross your brothers and win.,"DVD arrived as advertised with no marks or blemishes with no skipping.Lots of Jet Li sword fighting as expected and he was magnificant as always, but the ending was questionable since Jet Li double-crossed his two ""brothers"" for political power; this was something I did not expect in a Jet Li movie."
3,So so,"Too many characters, not well developed, and too many ""events"" leading to each one being too short and not well developed. Action scenes are so so."
3,The Warlords,This movie shows Jet Li in a very different image. His image is that of a power hungry soldier that will do whatever it takes to get to the top. His desire for a woman that befriended him at the beginning of the movie is all through the movie and even though she is already with someone else he doesn't care. The ending is unexpected. All in all this movie was ok.
3,Less than memorable,"Video and audio quality good. Movie is in English and dubbed. However, it just doesn't grab you. High on action however if you like this sort of story."
4,Jet Li much older but actually better,"I would have preferred the Chinese with English subtitles. The dubbing was surprisingly good. well, as for content, I thought this film told a very interesting tale of human nature- loyalty and betrayal, love and war. Not the typical good and evil dichotomy, as people are too complex to be just good and evil. It wasnt as bloody as I thought."
5,Worth watching,"This movie drew me in far more than I expected. Well acted, good character development and with a coherent plot. Thumbs up!This was my first try with Amazon's Digital movie rental and I will definitely be doing this again. Watched it on my laptop via Wi-fi in a motel room."
2,disappointing on many levels,"I thought this movie would be good because Jet Li is in it, but this was not the case. Not much martial arts here. the story was not very interesting. Regardless, you won't believe any reviews until you see it yourself so get ready to waste your time."
1,Dosent work,I tried this model for a long time. The blade consistantly veared off to one side cutting the pill 75% - 25% with the 25% side be crushed to poweder. i would give less than 1 star if i could.
1,A HOLLOW PUMPKIN,"I rented this one knowing well it probably would be a B movie but I expected it to at least be entertaining even in a bad way.I was sadly mistaken.The movie started bad and ended bad and you know you have stretched beyound anyones reason when the fat man gets a weapon out of his truck that happens to be a machine gun LMAO.It was at that moment that it could have gone camp and been a B classic but they went the way of bad cut gore scenes.Heck even when the girl is running through the woods she has a cheap video camera spotlight on her.I bursted out laughing on that one.And her country twang was so over the top it was insulting.If you want to make a good B movie at least make it entertaining.This one was not.I give a B for the cover art,but an F for the movie.His candle was blown out long before his first kill."
4,Killer B horror filck with lots of death scenes,"My girlfriend brought a screener home last night from BB video where she works and we watched it together. She would not let me go the whole movie. That's what I'm talking about. I got on Amazon today to order it and decided to comment. I lost count as to how many get the axe after about 12. There is one scene that is especially wicked involving a girl jogging and a guy driving a truck, that's all I'm gonna say because I do not wanna ruin it for you. I'm kind of disappointed that the monster on the cover looks different from the one in the movie but the one in the film looks better so that's okay. Me and Melissa give it 2 thumbs up. If you did not like this movie, then go get your head examined and get over it!"
1,jack-o-lantern,"I have seen some low budget movies before some okay others not so good. but this one really pushes the limit of bad b no sorry c movies. this story has been done before there were some okay scenes, but lets be honest the acting was terrible and the movie failed to scare me on any level."
3,A very clever film indeed.,This was a very clever endeavor in fimmaking. I am a student of film and this is a cool independent horror film. After reading the other reviews here on Amazon I can only say that I enjoyed it and that is all that matters to me. I abhore those small minded people who trash other people's good work. Just watch the film and judge for yourself. It's a fun thrill ride.
3,Finally another scary Halloween movie,"Finally another scary movie set during Halloween, and of course it was put out by Lions gate. I had the pleasure of renting it and watching it on my off day today after reading about it here on Amazon. I was pretty happy with the movie except for the Reverend character. The bad Guy Poley was funny, and the monster was neat. I jumped a few times, and was impressed by the venge murders. It is for sure a B movie but it is a good one. I bought jack O a few years back and that was okay too, but I like this one better."
2,Indie horror fanatic,"Well I can't say I love this film but I refuse to say I hate it it because I don't. It has some really good death scenes. The acting is fair, but it is an enjoyable film, and fun to watch. I am a huge Indie horror fan and I can tell by these Amazon reviews who are indie fans and who are mainstream horror nerds. For you main streamers, open up your mind.Larry"
2,The trailer makes it look good...,"Ugh. This movie is bad! After seeing the trailer, I was so excited to see it. The trailer is AWESOME! That is the only good thing about this. First of all, some of it was done with hand-held cameras, which is not necessarily bad. The sound effects are terrible. The acting stinks, as usual. This movie doesn't have much to do with a car accident, like the back says. The guy who plays Jack is cute, but slow. I got this at Hollywood Video, it was in the ""3 for $30"" section, now I know why."
3,Great film for Halloween,"I rented Jack O lantern today and found it to be a relly creative film with lots of scary scenes, and some very shocking killing scenes. I would not recommend this for kids, as the killing scenes are pretty graphic, one in particular. The acting is pretty good, and the music is great. The effects are really cool and the monster is different from anything I've ever seen. I figured he would be some scarecrow, but he is actually pretty cool looking. Be aware though that this is not a big budget horror film it is obviously an indie horror flick, but those are my favorites. I have seen some really bad Indie horror films in the past couple of years, but I was quite happy with this one. I guess I will buy it one day when the price comes down and add it to my hundreds of other horror DVD's.Don"
5,A Nice Collection,"The only reason I bought this book was for the short story in the back, ""Just Another Dragon Slaying"", which can't be found anywhere else. It's basically a short story that continues the adventures of Lylene and Weiland after The Conjurer Princess. However, I really like this collection of the stories. It's nicely bound, I like the cover art, and it's handy to have all three tales together in one convenient tome. The stories themselves are intriguing. I particularly love The Conjurer Princess and have read it over and over. My only complaint is that there aren't more stories about these characters out there."
4,Worth adding to your collection,"I suppose I'm a die-hard George Harrison fan because I do love this album. This may not be the best review because it comes from a very personal place within me, and doesn't reflect a true musical critique. This album takes me back to a strange, dark and searching time in my ""wonder years"". After all, what is an album but a bookmark in the soundtrack of our lives."
3,"Dark Horse ""Shows""","While not the best album by Mr. Harrison (hey, ya gotta show some respect), it certainly makes more since to me now than it did when I first listened to it while in high school. I'm glad I bought the album on CD and gave it another listen, as it is worth the time and dough. Go for it."
2,"C'mon, get real - this is a bad album.","If this album wasn't by an ex-Beatle it would have quickly been relegated to the dust bin. There are exactly three songs on this that are tolerable - Hari's On Tour(no vocal!-good) - Simply Shady, and Dark Horse. The cover of Bye Bye Love is one of the most pathetic covers I have ever heard. Maya Love is boring, and Ding Dong is just about as dumb as the song title implies. A real misfire for Geroge on this one."
2,Bringing Down The Horse,"Dark Horse was a quickly put together release to coincide with George Harrison's 1974 world tour. The album has a the feeling rushed and couple it with the fact that Mr. Harrison's voice was more or less shot. He smartly opens up with a solid instrumental ""Hari's On Tour (Express)"" which is a sprightly number but songs like an awful version of ""Bye, Bye Love"", ""Maya Love"", ""So Sad"" and ""Is It He"" are just not that great. Despite the overall weakness of the album a couple of songs stand out including the sublime title track and ""Ding Dong, Ding Dong"" which is a great holiday song. The album was yet another top ten effort, but it failed to spawn any top ten singles."
2,"""Dark Hoarse""","George Harrison's 1974 rush-release suffers from his obvious laryngitis - surely he could have waited until a full recovery. Not surprisingly, the best track on ""Dark Horse"" is the opening instrumental, ""Hari's on Tour."" Despite the impeccable musicianship, George's shredded voice ruins everything from the title song to an unnecessary remake of ""Bye Bye Love."" The world's finest digital remastering cannot salvage Harrison's weakest album."
4,Great one from George.,"This is a fabulous album, even though it was critically panned when it first came out. Sure, it's not ""All Things Must Pass"" or ""Taxman"", but then, if you were expecting that from George, you missed the message in this album's title track! Great songs on here, especially ""Simply Shady"", ""So Sad"", and his post-Pattie venting in his cover of ""Bye Bye Love"". It took me awhile at first to appreciate it, simply because I was more accustomed to earlier George works, but I'm so glad that I purchased this CD."
4,Dark Horse,"It took me a long of time before I really enjoyed this album. I was slightly upset at first. However, it grew on me and I rate it highly. It was an interesting time for George - his wife, Patti, had ran off with Eric Clapton, and so he has a go at him in 'Bye, Bye love'. His clear depression runs through this album. A particularly good album if you want to hear George at his most desperate. A true feeling of vulnerability shines through on this album."
3,His Throat was Horse,"Why George decide to record this album during a bout with the flu is a mystery. His Voice is absolutely terrible on this album.The only decent song on this album is Dark Horse, and even that plays on way too long. This album marked the beginning of George's struggle to produce quality music and revealed that he would never be able to equal the success of Lennon and Mccartney as he strived for many years to accomplish."
2,Not Very Good,You'd have to be a huge Harrison fan to like this one.The title track is enough to give it two stars. The rest is garbage.
4,"Solid, but not stellar","Who cares that it was not so graciously received by professional critics when it first came out... If you are a Harrison fan, you will want this cd. If you are interested because of his unfortunate passing, this is not the place to start (go for the gusts and get 'All things must pass'!). Once you have been hooked, then come back to this cd for the four or five great songs and the other ok songs. Though his voice is a little rough sounding on 'Dark Horse', it is the best song on here. 'Maya Love' and 'Sad Song' are also top notch. Hopefully, his cd's will get a remastering and bonus track treatment and where are those Traveling Wilbury cd's!!!!"
3,"Dark Horse, a sleeper, 3.5 stars","This album has been criticized over the years, largely because of the terrible condition of George's voice, but most of the songs are quite solid. The backing musicians are stellar as usual with Clapton, etc. too. The only song here that isn't that great is the uninteresting Far East Man. You can also ignore the review on this page that says ""he would never be able to equal the success of Lennon and Mccartney"". That person really needs a dose of All Things Must Pass as soon as possible."
3,An uneven album with some really good songs.,"Okay, my two cents.Dark Horse was the first solo George Harrison album that I bought. Out of the nine songs, my favorites - by far - were Dark Horse and It Is He. I also really liked Haris On Tour, So Sad, and Ding Dong Ding Dong. I hope all five tracks eventually make it to the inevitible box set. IMHO, the other four songs are pretty weak making the overall album uneven as a whole. However, I recommend that every Harrison fan check it out and make up their own mind.The Harrison albums that I would recommend are All Things Must Pass, Cloud 9, and ""George Harrison"". I'd also recommend Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1. I never checked out Live In Japan, but I've recently read some good reviews and list of songs looks pretty solid."
3,mixed bag,"I'll avoid the Dark Hoarse pun. Oh well, I couldn't resist. But seriously, the other reviews pretty much tell the story with one glaring omission. Simply Shady is a GREAT SONG.His voice even works well on that one.P.S. So Sad is not a bad cut, but i'm not sure why he jumps in and out of tense though."
5,the Best Money investment,"This album is not typical Eddie Money. He fills this album with outstanding Carribean sounds and a live feel of being there. I am typically not an Eddie Money fan but this album is in my top 10 favorite live albums (which include Jimmy Buffet's ""Feeding Frenzy"". Unplug-It In will definitely be overlooked by most but will be a gem for the one who doesn't pass it by."
4,Cycle Battery,"Battery worked, althought it is not the exact size and posts looked diffrent,with some modification worked, I have 2005 Klr 650."
3,Good,"I own four of Tierney's coloring books. The Empire Fashions book is well drawn in terms of the clothing, but the people's proportions, especially the women, seem a bit off. I like the addition of pages of hairstyles and accessories, and the two page spread with the drawing of Napoleon crowning Josephine is good as it gives historical perspective to the book."
2,There are better books on the market,"This is a rather shallow view of the development of Aer Lingus, looking mainly at the management side with little to no coverage of the engineering developments that made the growth of a world-class airline possible in a small country like Ireland. . My father-in-law spent his 45 year career with Aer Lingus (finishing in senior management) and also found the book disappointing."
2,Dissapointing,"This is nothing compared to their EP, which was great by the way. Songs lack of inventive, arrangements and feeling... maybe a couple of songs are to be rescued, but no more."
2,I spit on Americans! Ptooey!,"Do You Know Who You Are by Texas is the Reason: sub-par. Their mindless indulgences into the spiritless world of pop cheese befuddles me. Sure, the melodies are flowing, and the work is melancholy, but it seems so verily contrived. Dave said once to ""eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die."" Texas is the Reason has not shown me a real grasp upon this concept, and this concept is indeed the key to life! They are not jubilant, yet when they are sad, they are not speaking about real issues. They tend to repeat themselves many times in a droning manner which will entrance only the lowest form of humankind. To all those viewers out there with half a brain, check out such foreign bands as: Scorpions, The Verve, and Cibo Matto. Oscar de la Hoya would make a fine addition as well. Thank you for your time."
1,not relevant in 2005...,"back in the day i remember my friends babbling about this band called texas is the reason, but i never gave them a chance for some reason. so i did today, and i am extremely disappointed. someone said this band sounds like further seems forever and all those other new pop punk bands, but i would say it sounds like a high school band trying to sound like the current pop punk trend.the recording and production quality is considerably poor as well, dont waste your money kids...just turn mtv back on and let them make your music choices for you."
5,The best emo-core cd of all time.,Texas is the Reason could possibly be the best emo band ever. They definetly set the mark for bands such as Elliot and Jazz June. They add a touch of hard core to extremely emotional and heartfelt lyrics. It is sad this is their only cd. But Elliot has helped add to the genre texas helped begin.
3,typical pop-punk emoish record,"although this is by no stretch of the imagination a bad record, it just doesn't offer anything all that new or interesting. the drummer is very good, and although i can see how the guitar/bass interaction and the lead singer's voice could be appealing to some, after listening to the record in its entirety all i could think was that it was fairly repititive and not that musically challenging or interesting (not than every cd has to be musically challenging, but there are better places to look if you like bands in the same genre, like 764-HERO, built to spill, death cab for cutie, and many many others). nonetheless, there are some catchy tracks and this record might be worth the while if you need another catchy cd."
2,You will not find GPS in here,"The Sailor's Word Book: The Classic Source for Over 14,000 Nautical and Naval TermsCheck the date of publication before you buy this book. It was written in the 1800's and this is not apparent in the blurb about the book."
5,Legendary,"In this short book, the supremely intelligent Rene Guenon manages to crystallize some of the most fundamental ailments of modern society. He is neither afraid to examine from a traditionalist viewpoint all recent intellectual ""developments"" in science along with the callow, bigoted perceptions of modern philosophy, nor does he shy away from criticizing democracy and the notions of socio-political ""progress,"" or the diluted and comical nature of modern religion. Consistency and holistic understanding are Guenon's hallmarks, and he demonstrates it well with this succinct volume.This work is genuine treasure for all those capable of fully comprehending reality and naturally find themselves alone and at odds with contemporary civilization. Serves as a good introduction to the general orientations of authentic traditionalist thought. Guenon expands on this work significantly in its companion volume, The Reign of Quantity."
4,a good little introduction to the free will debates,"I found this book to be a useful introduction to the free will debates. One character is a compatiblist, the other a hard determinist, and the other an indeterminist-free willist. While the free-willist's position sometimes seems to be presented as a rather weak position (perhaps it's difficult not to do this!), this book will very much help the introductory student see the forest for the trees in the free will debate. This would be a good text to read before plunging into primary articles on the topic. It's an entertaining book, the arguments are explicit, and there's very little fluff or irrelevant banter."
2,poor spud,Did not care for these potatoes they were to sloppy and tasted un potato like. won't buy again.
5,Want to free your mind?,"Thomas Henry Huxley wrote in 1860, ""Extinguished theologians lie about the cradle of every science as the strangled snakes beside that of Hercules; and history records that whenever science and orthodoxy have been fairly opposed, the latter has been forced to retire from the lists, bleeding and crushed if not annihilated; scotched, if not slain."" This remarkable book documents this history. The author is respectful but painstakingly thorough. Page after page one will read of the idiocies propagated by Christian theologians and their inevitable refutation by advancing scientific knowledge. This book should be read by everyone, especially those remnants of the middle ages who still believe the Bible is a reliable guide to the study of nature."
4,Kraftwerk in Surround,"I saw Kraftwerk on their recent USA tour, and this DVD brought it all back, and better. The surround mix wasn't part of the US tour, at least in Seattle. The mix is even. I hate crowd noise during the music on most live albums, but this is minimal. The occasional surround effects aren't overdone, either. The best part of the show is the clean projections behind the quartet, and on this DVD they are edited in, so you get the clean graphics on your screen. I only wish this was available on blu-ray so the graphic parts were sharper. Highly recommended if you like Kraftwerk and have a surround system."
2,Joke?!?!?!?!?!?,Their music is amazing as always.The video? Are you joking? It is completely unnecessary. I'm glad I had never gone to any of their shows.
5,Excellent!!!!!!!!!,After seeing them live At The Rivera this is just as good if not better.Well worth the price. SEHR GUT !
3,Ignoring contemporary Tajik script is incorrect,"The authores should definitely get a credit for writiing a book on such a rare language as Tajik. However, I am not sure what to think about the script used throughout the book. It is not clear what script Cyrilllic, Romance or Arabic will be used for this language in the future. However, even if the Romance alphabet is approved for use, it will probably look different from what is presented by the authors. I doubt that digraphs like GH, KH, SH, and ZH will be in use. We also do not know how the Tajik are going to use the Romance alphabet to present their vowels. So, ignoring the modern Tajik alphabet lowers the value of this book. E.g., what if the reader finds an authentic Tajik sentence ? Then, knowing all the words and grammar, will not help figure out what it is about. So, I believe that the authors should have given a table presenting contemporary Tajik script at least for references."
1,terrible,"Absolutely useless. Does not even use the alphabet of the country to which it refers, even though most visitors to Tajikistan would probably know some Russian. The dictionary part is so short that it has virtually none of the words that one might see on a sign or come across in daily life. What use is a phrase book without a decent accompanying dictionary? How can one form sentences without knowing any vocabulary? I certainly hope that a real Tajik-English-Tajik dictionary is written soon."
5,A Fun Read,Legends of Nevermore County could be anywhere in the world. Ms. Bradford has captured the essence of small towns and the sometimes odd people that live there. I will always remember Mother Goody asthe person who can always fix things that just don't go right. I also think that Summer Island has the potential for a great movie.
1,Definitely a Pass,"I can't recommend this novel. It's stuck somewhere between being for kids and being for adults and doesn't know what to do with itself. The storylines and general feeling is suitable for kids, but the level of writing is overly detailed for them. The characters are too one-dimensional to be of any entertainment. I couldn't identify with any of them. The environments are very cliched mystical Grimm brothers kind of stuff. The writer is in love with the sound of her own voice and just goes on and on sometimes."
2,"The book was interest, but contained many inaccuracies.","The book contains many interesting tidbits on famous dead movie stars, but it full of glaring mistakes. For example, in one section on William Randolph Hearst his wife is named as Millicent. However, in the section on Marion Davies his wife is named Pheobe, who is actually his mother. I have found inaccurate dates and locations. One paragraph will contradict another. The amount of errors makes the whole book suspect. Also, directions to some of the stars final resting places is detailed and others not all. For a serious Thantologist, I would only recommend this book for entertainment value."
4,Final Curtain a book for those who loved and love the movies,"In reading Final Curtain I found myself back in the Hollywood of yesteryear with those famous names and people who made HOLLYWOOD and its movies great. I enjoyed the book immensely,Final Curtain is not just a book about death and gravestones, but about the people who gave and used their various talents to entertain."
3,A so-so book,"This book has some good stories in it but as far as grave hunting goes, it's not very complete. It's okay to have for entertainment but not as a reference book."
5,You'll never go back to white rice,"A huge difference in flavor and texture versus the plain supermarket brands. Yes, it costs a little more but still less than pre-prepared rice mixes. Try this ""mexican"" recipe.2 Cups rice, 1 tbs Olive Oil, brown rice in skillet2 Cups water, 1 Tomato, 1/2 Onion, 1 clove garlic, 1 tbs Chicken bullion, tps salt, chop up in blender to rough texture.Add blender mix plus additional 2 1/2 cups water, 1/4 red wine to browned rice.Cover simmer until water absorbed."
1,"Dull read, laden with acronyms","The plot of TARGET ACQUIRED sounded interesting--the reason I bought the book--and another author probably could've pulled it off. It is about the testing of 'Tiger', a revolutionary UAV(Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) for the government under The Patriot Act. The technical team has a traitor in its midst, and you can guess the rest. Acronyms abound in this book to the point of distraction. There's so many that I doubt this entire page would hold them all. Makes for boring reading. In addition,the prose is choppy at best, the characters paper cut-outs, and the conclusion was rushed. I wanted to quit halfway through, but decided to finish it, thinking I would find a reason why the book was published. A real stinker here."
3,A good book to check out of the library,"The book is touching, I'll give Ann Imbrie that, but really, she doesn't have enough material to warrent a full length book. Because she lacks many facts, she invents what she doesn't know and does a good job doing it, but the book should be marketed as such i.e. it is really about her feelings and reminisces of her dead friend, not what happened to her. An excellent book to borrow from a friend, check out from the library, or purchase used, but i wouldn't pay full price for it."
5,I feel like I knew Lee,"I have never read a book so poetically written. I wish I had known Lee. I am sorry she is gone. My favorite part was the comparison with the ""Weegee"" photograph and Lee's own childhood ""eyes."" The part that made me smile, because I have seen it, is the comparison with Detroit and Windsor. Anyway, if you are planning to buy this book, do so, it is a thought provoking and beautifully written book. I am so glad I read it. Thank you Ann Imbrie, very much."
3,Ite was just OK,"Though I could use the breaker, it did not fit the CH panel as well as I had hped. The marking on the breaker stated that it was for a CHT panel, not just a CH panel as advertised."
1,"Crappy, crappy, crappy manual, website","It's supposed to be a universal remote. Guess what - no list of TV codes in the manual, no list anywhere on the XBox website - I've just wasted a ton of time looking. We've managed to program it - slow tedious painful code search - but this is ridiculous!"
2,Fuhgettaboutit,"If you need a remote to turn on the tele and run the 360, this will do. But it won't operate a DVR, DVD, VCR or cable box. If you're really keen on it, I'll sell you mine."
5,xbox,"its simple, you can use your controler to do most of the fuctions this remote can do but, it takes a lot more time. Same differance with highspeed and dialup. If you have dont mind taking a little longer to get things done then use the controler. personally, I like my 360 remote!"
3,"""Universal"" is a misnomer, good for movies on the Xbox 360","I should have read up on this remote a little more before purchasing it. I guess ""universal"" means something different to me. What you get is a great remote for watching DVD's, Downloaded Zune Marketplace videos, media center videos, or Netflix videos on the Xbox. What you don't get is a remote that does anything for a basic sound system and does nothing but the very basics (on/off, volume) for most televisions. Also, the remote requires a direct line of sight to the Xbox 360 to work at all. I was disappointed, but it is pretty cheap and it does do great with the Xbox so I can't take away more than 2 stars."
3,numbers rubbed off the buttons,"this works ok with my Xbox, TV and media center. My complaints are:1. the numbers and letters have rubbed off the buttons! I had to memorize them. what cheap-o design. would it have killed them to embed the ink into the plastic?2. it seems kind of slow when adjusting the volume (compared to my other remote, which does it fast)3. the range could be better. I have to be right in front of the tv to get it to work, I can't be off to the side, even if I'm only about 6 feet away.4. it will turn my tv off, but not on."
3,"Works but not ""universal""","I purchased this remote since we started using our Xbox 360 as a Windows 7 Media Extender. It is light, buttons are easy to press and nicely spaced. Buttons are back-lit as well. For a basic remote, it works. However, it will control ONLY your TV and XBOX. It will not control any other A/V accessories, which these days, should be a requirement. If we start using the Xbox for the Media Center function extensively, this remote will probably get replaced with a more advanced remote.(For people with a more advanced A/V setup, consider the Logitech Harmony Advanced Universal Remote For Xbox 360 instead. It is more pricey but will control everything under the sun.)"
4,As advertised,"Its a well made remote that works without any problems at all. Not too much to say; its overpriced since its proprietary, but its great for watching DVDs, etc, on your xbox."
3,Good for its price,"Usually Xbox accessories are a little pricey. However, this one seems to do the job and the price is very good.Only problem I had was programming it to work with the TV (to do most functions).I think the manufacturer should include the TV codes with the product; it would make it a little more easy to setup."
2,Hope you have good aim,"The remote will not work if you have any obstructions within the direct line of sight between yourself and the console's IR sensor. My 360 is set up near the floor and I can't use the remote from my bed less than six feet away.As another reviewer mentioned, this is due to the poor design of the console itself, not necessarily with the remote. But it's still disappointing. Given the Xbox 360 branding, you'd expect the remote to work at least as well as the controllers, but that's too much to ask in this case.It does work with my TV flawlessly, but that's not exactly the point..."
3,xbox 360 remote....meh,"I received this remote with my hd-dvd player, its a good looking remote and it will also control the 360 dashboard but it has a major flaw. I alomost have to be directly in front of my 360 for this thing to work, if I'm off at an angle, any kind of angle I have to hold my arm out to get more in line with the 360 to make it work..pretty lame"
2,only universal for a little while,after a couple weeks my remote lost the ability to switch between TV and xbox control. My neighbor had the same remote and his had the same problem but I do not know how long his lasted before losing TV control.payed extra for a Universal remote and basically got an elongated xbox dashboard controller
5,love it,"this remote is great for anyone who wants to watch movies from their pc or dvds on their xbox 360. like the xbox 360 controller, it is very sturdy and very comfortable. i have had it for 2 months now and is working as good as the day i got it."
3,Another controller,Classic remote that does all the job . Navigate in menu or watch DVD...Not required if you have a dvd player
3,Nice to have but....,"I thought having it was going to be more convienent but honestly I haven't used it all that much. Its one of those ""I think I could really use it"" but after having it... not so much. Save your $ and just use your controller that came with your xbox..."
4,Great,"I purchased this remote because im replacing my cable with Netflix and Hulu Plus for the most part, and I hate using the controller as a remote. So I bought the Xbox 360 Universal Remote and being that this one was used didn't matter. I got the remote and its in great condition and works perfectly. Although if you have a White-Westernhouse TV the code doesn't work but you can use Eltrcoband instead and worked perfectly."
4,Priceless if... but could be better,"This remote is priceless, if... you play media through your xBox 360. If you only play games, and the occasional DVD; not worth it. If you have all your media on your computer, or network, and stream it, or Netflix through your xBox, then this is ridiculously(!!!) better than trying to navigate using the original controller.That being said, the shape of this remote is not at all ergonomic, nor does it fit nicely into my remote caddy, and it lacks the ability to control more than just your tv and xBox (no other components, like a receiver). So it will set you free on the one hand, and frustrate the hell out of you on the other. Definitely worth it if it's on sale, though."
4,fine product.,"works perfectly fine. came with batteries, but without any original packaging. didn't come with any sort of manual, either."
3,On the Fence.,"I purchased it with the intent of using my xbox connected to my MacMini running Windows7 & Media Center so that I can watch TV and DVR'ed programs on my TV. I figured I would use my XBox as the Infrared to control it and so I purchased this remote. I bought it specifically for the Windows Media Center button in the middle that turns on the Xbox and loads WMC in one click. It works. However, the XBox fan is too loud to hear the TV (not a flaw of the remote). I also find that when I fast fwd through the commercials, hitting it once is too slow, but hitting it twice sends me to the point well into the show and so I have to rewind. Because of these issues, I haven't fully migrated to watching tv solely through the Xbox w/ the remote. I'm thinking of now purchasing an USB IR & Remote that will plug directly into my MacMini instead and skip the XBox."
4,xbox360 remote,It looks just like it was shown in the picture. The remote works fine the only thing i don't like about it is you have to point it directly at the xbox360 or it wont work..But that isn't the sellers fault.
4,Good for a Simple Remote for Both TV and 360,"Its not complicated. Although you do need to get to the 'net to get the codes for the tv, but otherwise its great! Not a bad price either!"
2,looks good..but its not really worth the money on this one..,"this is a nice deluxe remote for the 360..its backlit but thats about it..nothing really new here..if you were ""lucky"" to get a 360 fully loaded version..you have the limited edition remote that came with it.. trust me, its all that you need..and half of the buttons you dont even need to use mostly just for the dvd functions"
4,great product!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I GOT THE REMOTE FOR CHRISTMAS , AND I LOVE IT, IT DOES WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO. THE ONLY COMPLAINTS I HAVE IS IT IS A LITTLE ANNOYING TRYING TOI FIND THE TV CODES, YOU JUST HAVE TO GO TO THE WEBSITE GIVIEN AND SEARCH ALL AROUND UNTIL YOU FIND THE RIGHT PAGE , AND THE REMOTE DOSEN'T USE THE SAME WIRELESS SYSTEM ASS THE CONTROLLERS SO YOU DO HAVE TO HAVE THE REMOTE POINTING PRETTY MUCH AT THE XBOX, BUT I HAVN'T HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH DISTANCE OR ANYTHING ELSE, I HAVE ONLY USED IT FOR NETFLIX SO FAR, BUT THAT IS THE ONLY REASON I WANTED IT, AND I HAVE TO SAY IT WORKS GREAT FOR XBOX AND MY TV. I'M VERY SATISFIED!!!"
3,xbox 360 remote,I havent used this yet as its for hubby for christmas but im sure he will be happy he can now watch dvds on his xbox but the shipping was great---Came fast
2,No good for me.,"Buttons are very sensitive and numbers get repeated almost constantly, which makes it practically useless as a remote for my TV."
1,Worthless,"I really don't like the remote. It's range sucks straight of the package. My couch is only 12 feet away from the 360 and I have to get 4 feet closer just to use the dang thing. I have to hit the buttons multiple times for it to get the reaction I want. Finally to top it all off, It works with nothing else I own, not my TV, DVD, Surrond sound set, Nothing. Save your money and just by another controller, they do every thing that this does. Totally totally worthless."
1,"Junk, may be counterfeit",Crapped out 30 days after warranty expiration. Pisses me off. Dealer sells juh-unk! So unimpressed i'll be sure to buy replacement elsewhere.
3,Handy but Lacking,"Found out the hard way that this doesn't support Olevia televisions. It's a nice remote with good functions for media on Xbox, but universal just doesn't seem like the right word..."
4,Functional Media Center Device,The remote operates as expected. Greatly simplifies watching Media Center and Netflix content through the Xbox 360. There is no reason not to purchase this device if you need a media remote control.
3,It's ok,"This remote works fantastic with my xbox but i could not get it programmed for my TV. I have an older Sony and the codes provided did not work. When i tried the manual way of clicking through, i spent a half an hour and gave up. I just control volume with another remote."
4,Great! Except...,"The remote is intuitive and easy to use. Well labeled and more convenience than using your game controller for watching movies. The only improvement that I see is either glow-in-the-dark buttons or a longer backlight. On mine, the buttons only light up for a second or two which is not long enough to find that one button I never use.Bottom line - recommended controller, but get used to where the buttons are if you watch movies in the dark like I do."
4,XBox 360 Remote Control,"Does what its supposed to do. We got it to make watching Netflix instant movies on the XBox more convenient. The remote gives you better ""pause"", ""stop"" and""play"" control than with the game controller. Well worth the $20. Only drawback: You have to aim the remote DIRECTLY at the XBox for it to work... if you are even slightly off it does not work. All in all, we are glad we got it."
4,Works great for Netflix,"I recommend this remote if you want an easier way to use Netflix than using a regular controller, or if you use your 360 as your primary DVD player. Don't get this if you want something that will control extra devices though; it will control your 360 and your TV only."
4,works okay,"This remote works well with the xbox360, but it has a very limited reach with its remote sensor. I thought it would be more like the controllers and it didn't matter where you pointed them or where your xbox is located. This has to be pointed directly at the xbox and i mean it has to be aimed right at the xbox sensor and you cant be too far away. If your xbox is behind your tv like mine was then you will have to move it for this to be useful. Plus the remote only works for your tv and is very limited in what it does for that. Everything it does for the xbox is good."
2,Beware: IR--not RF--remote,"Unlike all of the Xbox remotes, this does not use RF (radio) to connect to the console. Because it is infrared, it only works if you can point it directly at your console, or get lucky with it bouncing off the walls. Unfortunately this changes my plans for how to lay out the room."
2,Not a Universal remote,"This remote works fine to control an XBox;however, it will not control a new Vizio TV. I tried both specific codes provided by Vizio as well as the ""try everything"" option on the remote. I did find one setting that would control volumn on the TV, but none would change channels nor inputs. If your goal is to have only one remote to control your TV and xBox -- this is not it!"
2,Spend some money,This is serviceable but a very dumb remote. You are better off getting a logictech harmony if you have the money. I don't know why with four wireless controllers the remote couldn't rely on that tech rather than having a clear line of sight and IR.
3,I works,"This thing works well enough, although I would much rather it be Bluetooth than infrared. This is a Xbox licensed product, but I don't like it a whole lot.the edges are too round for it to sit at any kind of slope and the buttons interact with my laptop (my laptop has windows media center with an infrared receiver on the front of itI would only recommend this if you want to have Xbox only stuff"
2,"Looks good, but.....","This remote looks really nice, especially if you like the look of the Xbox 360, as it mirrors the sleek design of the console. It has buttons that can control your Xbox dashboard and while I haven't yet linked my console with my PC, there is a button to access your Windows Media Center right on the remote. This remote is hardly universal however, it will only control your Xbox 360 and your TV. If you have any other components such as a VCR or a seperate DVD player, it will not control these. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, there seems to be no input button to switch from watching TV to gaming. I even called Xbox technical support to see if I was missing something, and apparently there just isn't a button for that. This means that I would still have to keep several other remotes around just to have all the functions I need. Overall, a nice looking remote, but falls short. I will be taking mine back to the store."
1,These are REFURBISHED remotes - NOT NEW!!!,"I liked getting this in the ""frustration-free"" packaging until I realized there was NO Microsoft documentation AT ALL with it. Some xeroxed instructions and that's it. That means NO WARRANTY for these controllers. Plus if you look at the back under the light you'll see some minor marks/scratches.Maybe a 90 day warranty really is no big deal. Maybe some marks don't matter either.It would be honest however, to properly sell this as refurbished so you can decide if $10 plus $3 shipping for these used units is a good deal next to the brand new $19.99 models.I figured the price was too good to be true and it was - I'll probably keep it but the seller is simply dishonest by not mentioning this on Amazon.Be aware of this before you buy."
2,Works fine with my HDTV; not so good with XBox,"This remote works fine with my HDTV but doesn't seem to work well with the XBox. It doesn't come with trouble shooting information. If anyone has detailed operating instructions, please send them along."
2,Ergonomic mess,"Remote feels very solid and seems to be made of high quality plastic. Media Center launcher button and dedicated ""Live TV""/""Guide"" buttons are nice. Biggest issue is how long the remote is, and it's wedge shape. Going from play/pause to volume is basically a 2-handed operation. If you try to slide your hand down the remote slides back up b/c it's heavy and plastic is slick, and because of it's wedge shape. Going back and forth between xbox mode and TV mode is also a carpal-tunnel excercise.I went back to my old TV remote and just use this remote for DVD/Media Center operations now."
2,Thanks for the crappy remote Bill Gates.,"Its really not that bad. I am just a little bitter about spending 26 dollars it, and now the button text is wearing off QUICK. I hate that! Theres no programmable feature like Nyko's and the reception is nothing like the 360's controller. But it is a remote, it matches the 360, and it does work all the time."
5,Super product,This is a great universal remote. It controls your tv settings with a little programming and your dvd settings without any programming. One of the nicest features is the all the buttons on the remote light up. This makes it easy to find what feature you want even in the dark where I watch the majority of my dvd's.
3,XBOX 360 Remote Control,I bought this remote to make using the XBOX 360 as a DVD player much easier than with a game controller. It's excellent so don't hesitate to get one.Xbox 360 Universal Media Remote
4,Good for consolidation...,"I bought this to basically consolidate the remotes into one remote for DVD watching.This remote does just that... nothing more. So, if you're looking for newer features or something that this remote offers that the console controller does not, do not buy.It basically works with the TV and the XBox360. So, it's not universal in terms of a surround sound system, other dvd players, etc..."
4,Nice Product,Has very nice features with this. Lighted buttons are visible and bright in the dark. Simple and very user friendly. It's perfect for me. The only downside is you have to go online to get tv codes so you can set up remote. Works like a charm.
3,Poor signal strength,You really have to point this at the xbox or other devices to get it to work. No obstructions or distance are acceptable. I don't use it anymore.
4,Basic - but very reliable,"This is the older 1st pty remote put out by Microsoft. and hasn't changed since 2007. There is some functionality the remote is missing like frame by frame pause progression, but that's more a fault of Xbox 360's inability to support frame by frame on video playback than any fault of the remote.This is the second I purchased rather than a newer version and that's because the remote is so sturdy and reliable. The last one I had lasted 6 years and I only had to replace it, because the output had begun to fail.All in all this remote is a great value, and stands up to years of normal wear and tear."
5,Best Magazine on Earth,"I've been a reader of SFX for a few years, and I'm happy to say that it's never let me down. It is consistently outstanding and with it's shiny new redesign, it's not only the coolest looking magazine out there but it's also the best publication for celebrating and navigating all things geek. With a team of extraordinarily talented and passionate writers on board, SFX will keep you up-to-date with all of your favourite sci-fi/fantasy shows, writers, directors, comics, and conventions with entertaining and brilliantly written reviews, interviews, columns, and more. If you love SF/fantasy and horror, then this is the magazine for you! Simply put, SFX is frakkin' awesome. As a geek, I'm so grateful to have found it. So say we all!Sfx"
4,A good product.,"I like it, it works. I'm not sure what the rare-earth magnets are all about, but it's *not& so you can stick it to the side of steel while leveling."
5,Very cool and Very Cute,"Summary: Well made synthetic socks in a repeating pattern across all three pairs across the set.Review: These socks have pocketbooks and cute shoes on the pairs, which have the same pattern, but a different background color. I wore them with the same background color, but my teen wore them in all sorts of crazy combinations. Like all such socks, a few were eaten by the God of the Dryer, which demands a sacrifice of socks, especially ones that have a pattern which needs to be matched. So now the teen wears them, and loves them,. They've held up almost three years, and the remaining ones look almost new.I heartily endorse them, but suggest that you appease your Dryer Gods before purchasing them, and make sure that you pin the pair together before washing. Just in Case, anyway."
3,Cool to use,"I purchased this salt after hearing about my sister's trip to Haiwaii. The salt is fine, and I like it, but it cost me almost twice that amount to ship it to me in NY so I was not a fan. I will be suing it sparingly and be on the search for it in specialty stores. The price was right BEFORE I actually saw the shipping price."
3,An ok salt,"I'm a newbie to exotic salts but I thought I would try this because of the reviews. What a disappointment. To me and my family it just tastes like kosher salt. Yes the black is a novelty, but is it worth the price? I can use kosher salt, which is about the same size, and save a lot of money."
4,Beautiful black salt,I bought two of these containers to give as gifts so I cannot comment on flavor. The containers themselves are very attractive and sturdy and the black salt is very striking. I didn't give 5 stars because there is some empty space in the container (about half in inch from the top). It makes it look like it wasn't filled properly. I weighed it and the salt with the container is 193g (6 oz is equal to 170g) so it's definitely full. I realize I'm just being nit-picky but appearances mattered to me since I'm presenting it to someone else as a gift.
2,"Interesting product, but not highly recommended","The black salt seems a little bit mouisture. When you are seasoning in you dish or pan, the black colour may spread over.""Although not as popular as the traditional red alaea salt, hawaiian black sea salt, or lava salt, is a dramatic, glossy black sea salt. The unique color comes from lava, which adds minerals and activated charcoal which results in a sulfuric aroma and earthy flavor.hawaiian black sea salt is used both as a finishing salt and a roasting salt. It is often used as a coating on fish to help preserve both flavor and moisture as it bakes.suggested uses:Delicious on all types of seafoods, especially shellfish such as clams, mussels or scallops."" - By www.faeriesfinest.com"

1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,"I read the good reviews of Wart Wonder and figured I would give this a try. I wanted to get rid of this wart on my leg. What harm could it do? I have sensitive skin so I try to be careful of what I put on my skin. I had to stop use on day three (I should have stopped on day one) because my leg got a bad, what I thought was a rash. After going to the doctor he informed me that the ""creosote"" that Wart Wonder contains BURNED my skin. Thanks Wart Wonder! I don't just still have the wart but now I also have a burn mark that will most likely leave a scar. DO NOT BUY WART WONDER!"
4,ECCO Men's Neo Basic Slip-on,The shoes took about 3 weeks to break in..but they now feel great. They look pretty good too.
3,A little snug,"While this is a very nice looking shoe for the price, it seems to run a little small. I typically bounce between a 14/15 based on the brand of shoe, so since ordering online picked up the shoe labeled (15 / 15.5) which I thought would give me plenty of room.... It is wearable but very tight on the feet. I'm hoping it will stretch out over time.I would recommend if purchasing this shoe to go +1 on the size."
3,Relevant but dated,"Very good empirical material from the early stages of the market. The book is dated though since it has not been updated post the great increase in the size of markets. New classes of distressed coporates (telecoms & possibly future current dotcoms ?), new markets (Japan/Asia), new value extraction methods (CBOs) etc. which have materialised in the past few years need to be addressed as well, both in terms of market developments and further empirical evidence."
3,Good but dated,"When I looked at the publication date above it said: ""Paperback - 248 pages 2 edition (February 1999). In fact this book was actually published in 1991, making it 10 years old. If you were reading this book in say 1992 or 1993 it would be really relevant, but not in 2001. The basic information still remains useful and interesting, but the data summaries that date from 1989 are just not relevant anymore. ... I probaly would not have bought this book and would have looked for something fresher."
3,Doesn't help with spider veins,"I've tried so many creams for my spider veins, but none helped. I guess I have to return to sclerotherapy."
2,not good,"I didn't read the Ingredients and found this product contain Mineral oil which can clog your pores. The Vitimin E it claims to have is 18th on the list.. my bad for not reading this first. Mineral oil is basically a petro oil, which is something that can make your car run in certain forms. It does not allow your skin to breath.."
2,NIGHT CREAM,CANNOT TELL THAT THIS PRODUCT HAS ANY AFFECT ON MY SKIN AT ALL. IHAVE USED IT NOW FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS. IT DOES HAVE A BURNING SENSATION SO THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE DOING SOMETHING???
2,I wouldn't buy them again,"I was so excited to get this product....and I was so disappointed after using it.My issues with it are 1. you have to push it way down your back so the strap doesn't show at your neck. So it doesn't work with v-neck and that type of shirt. 2. After wearing all day, it made my skin raw where the straps were hitting.Definitely would not buy again. And if I had kept the orignal wrapping, I would return them."
2,hard to use,"this product worked somewhat, it is hard to use. Hard to put on and feels tight when worn."
1,Wouldn't Recommend,This makes your straps very tight and uncomfortable even after loosening them. I also had to have someone else put it on for me as I couldn't do it myself. These will sit in my junk draw.
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,"I read the reviews on these and thought I'd found the answer to falling bra straps -- at last. These things are only good if you have someone to help you get dressed in the morning. If not, you can only hook them on at the top of the straps, thus pulling the straps so close to your neck that you can see the straps in the neck opening of your top in the front. A waste of money as far as I'm concerned. Unless, of course, you're planning to wear a turtleneck, which just doesn't work for me in the summer in Massachusetts."
4,Works great,"This product works great for concealing bra straps, but does make the bra a little more uncomfortable. These strap accessories spend more time in the dresser drawer than they get used."
1,It's hard to get on and there was PEN INK all over them.,I would not reccomens this idem. They are nearly impossible to get on and there was PEN INK or something of the sort all over them. Needless to say I did not see it at first and it ruined me brand new $40.00 nursing bra.
2,Strapper Bra Accessory,"I didn't like this item. It seemed like a great and helpful idea, but when I got it (which I got it really fast, so points for that!), I tried it out immediately, and it was so dorky! At first I couldn't even figure out how to put it on my bra straps; finally I got it to work, but it was so far up my straps that it was uncomfortable! I got this product to wear my regular bras with my halter tops, but when I tried it with one of my tops, it still showed my straps plus you could totally see the clip on my back because it was so high up! Then I realized I was putting it on wrong, so I tried it exactly as shown and described on the packaging and I never could figure out how to make it work, as it kept falling off. This product was cheap though, so you get what you pay for as they say. Easier to find a bra already designed for halter tops I think."
1,not working,"Hopes dashed. only way I could get it to work is to turn it sideways. then the shoulder straps on my bra get pulled into a halter configuration & show in the neckline of a v-neck tee. Now I know why there's no pic of the front view. Considering there is approximately 10 cents worth of plastic in the 2 clips, that's quite a profit, especially for an item that doesn't work. Don't waste your money."
4,They do the job...,"This 3-pack does the job, but are much more flimsy that I anticipated. I do not know if they are poorly made or just not what I was expecting..."
3,"It works, but it's not comfortable!","It works, and it does the trick when I want to wear my little white dress and not have the straps show in the back, and it does something for the cleavage. It's a pain to get on though, especially if you are not terrible flexible (can you touch between your shoulderblades reaching over your shoulder?) And it's not particularly comfortable to wear. So for the price it's a good deal, it works, but I'd rather spend the extra money and buy a convertible bra!I purchased a strap with a flat hook closure that pulls teh straps together closer without the drama and uncomfortable-ness of the ""Strapper"" and am very pleased! My straps no longer show and I still feel comfortable in a cute litte summer dress!"
3,Work good,"These bra clips work very well if you use them correctly- I have a hard time with that. If you are new to using bra clips it can be very difficult to set these up by yourself so a little help may be needed. A common mistake is keeping your straps as tight as you normally have them. When using bra clips you do need the straps a little looser than you would wear your bra. To get that ""lift"" you always read about the clip would have to be moved down toward the bra band. These clips are fairly hard to use but work well.3 Stars because:-Hard to use-Come in 3 colors-Work well when you figure them out"
4,Just what it should be,"The Strapper did just what it is supposed to do. I did have to ask my husband to help me put it on, if I put it on before I tried to put my bra on, it would just pop out, but once it was on, it was perfect. It kept me from having to buy a special bra for a dress I wear only a few times a year. I'm very pleased with it."
1,Not So Good,"You have to be a contortionist to use this product. I returned it, but it slipped out of the box to ""who knows where"" (my credit loss). Therefore, did not get my credit. So, if you order & return, put them in a padded envelope so they don't get lost & you receive your credit."
3,"Good, But Not Great","The Paragons had a great doo wop sound but this CD doesn't offer enoughof their music. This CD contains 14 tracks. I highly recommend that youcheck out the CD ""The Very Best Of The Paragons: Florence"", whichcontains all 14 of these tracks plus 14 others. For not much more incost, it's a great bargain! You are invited to check out my review ofthat CD, as well."
1,Confusion! Two Groups With the Same Name!,"Watch Out! There were 2 groups named ""The Paragons"", the Brooklyn based doo-wop band and the Jamaican ska and rock-steady band starring John Holt. This album is from the lesser-known Brooklyn group."
3,Good reference but a struggle to read,"Concepts are not well conveyed in later chapters...have to reread to get what he is try to get at. I own a cherokee but found Cleared for Takeoff, a ""cessna book"", easier to read. The information is very good but could be explained in simpler terms. If you fly a high wing use the Cessna book and cd's....if you fly a low wing this is a good reference but sometimes tough reading."
2,Not Really Complete,"I have read two of this author's books, and both books have a common trait.They start out great for the first two chapters, but starting in the 3rd chapter - and getting worse with each progressive chapter, the author's writing becomes labored, incomplete, and ... well.... kinda boring.It's like he becomes bored with writing, or maybe gets in a hurry to complete the project.This makes reading through to the end of the book a laborious chore.As for complete - far from it!He omits important subjects that are on the written exam for the private pilot's license.Sometimes his writing is just maddening.For instance - he mentioned the segmented circle for checking wind, and there is even a nice illustration - but no explanation of how to read it what all the markings mean.I will not read any more books by this author.Nor can I recommend them to others."
5,Very good pre-flight-training book,"Read this book to whet your appetite before starting flight training. Great information, great tips that you'll carry with you once you start flying."
3,Kelsey could never marry a man like Serle,"From the back cover:Serle Falconer had hurt her father-led him to financial ruin-anddestroyed her parents' marriage. In Japan to visit her father, Kelsey lost no time in finding Mr. Falconer and telling him what a swine she thought he was. So he couldn't seriously want to marry her. The marriage proposal, sent by a go-betwen in the traditional Japanese style, was nothing more than a cruel practical joke designed to pay her back for insulting him. Angered, Kelsey decided two could play that game. Maybe she'd just call his bluff and accept his proposal...."
4,"Good price, good CD",Pop this CD in your player and you wont be dissapointed. The higher paced tracks in 1-4 truly are great. Shadow is a gem that thankfully most radio stations haven't touched.The only beef I have with this CD is the slower songs just dont seem to fit well with the rest of the CD your fault can be the exception. The band opted to put in a slightly slower version of beautiful night which takes away some of the power the CD offers to fans IMO (esp for me a big toadies fan).For Toadies fans this CD will definately be worth the 10 bucks. Most of the tracks resonate an old toadies feel.
2,Disappointed,I don't understand where they went a rye but somehow todd did. I am a die-hard Toadies fan I mean I love that band so I assumed I would love his new band Burden Brothers. But to my amazement I hated most of this album it is too soft for me and sounds way too pop rock radio compliant. Bring back your Toadies rawness and this band will be alright.
4,Burden Brothers Rock,"This album remains in constant rotation in my CD changer. If you're a fan of Toadies, then you'll enjoy Todd Lewis' vocals and lyrics. The album isn't as heavy as the Toadies, but it's still fantastic and I like each and every song on it. It's not filled with the pomp and cirumstance of most CD's released these days. It's just good rock!"
3,Well its...,"Kinda good and kinda bad.First the good. This album brings some bang with a bluesy sound, some cool guitar riffs, and an above average garage/blues/rock musicianship. It is simple and great music for a new guitarist or easy listenin while having a bar B que.The bad. The singer repeats himself way to often, it gets annoying."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"Other reviews are written, most probably, by Toadies fans. As a newbie to this band, but certainly no means to music, this has to be one of the absolute WORST recordings I have ever heard. Saying people who like the White Stripes 'Elephant' may also like this will be in for a very rude awakening - there is simply no comparison between the savvy simplicity of the guitar/drum duo of the Stripes and the overblown histrionics of the Burden Brothers. The musicianship is completely overblown in the Name of ROCK and the lyrics are the most insipid, moronic goop since the Carpenters. In fact, I would rather listen to the Carpenters. I can't decide whether to throw this cd away or simply use it as a coaster. I'm certainly glad I bought this on sale, it is just not worth the money and time lost."
1,"Good Lord, this is bad.","I certainly realize that different people have different tastes, but this CD is really, really bad. The sound of the band is quite outdated and the lyrics are so simple its almost offensive. ('Come on down, I want to meet you, I want to meet you, I want to meet you, ALLLLLL!'..blech) The only song I could listen to all the way through was ""Beautiful Night"" and even that one had the early 90s yelling part which almost ruined it for me. But if you enjoy totally thoughtless lyrics and singers yelling over simple loud music, this cd is for you."
3,Better than I expected,"This movie was better than I anticipated for an indy film. Cover looked like kid's video game. Was surprised by acting and drama in the film about vet with self esteem/money/love issues. Some echoes of ""Twilight"" with the speed and strength of a few of the characters, but not too sci fi-ish. More a conspiracy thriller with romantic overtones."
2,Small & Poorly Framed,"It is small, although it divulges the size in the description. Mine was also poorly framed...there was white space unevenly between the actual poster and the frame. It didn't look like a matte because it was uneven."
5,Mesmerizing!,"I have had this CD for a few years now and it is one of my favorites that gets played over and over. I first heard it in a store,and as I stood there,between the aisles of books, I drifted into a peaceful serene place,visually and energetically, and knew I wanted to be able to go there again and again with the help of this beautiful music. If you absolutely adore the twilight time of the day,like I do, than this is for you. Peaceful, calming , beautiful..you won't be sorry. Enjoy"
4,User friendly for travelers,"If you want to learn Spanish for travel to Spain, this is a very useful product. Contrary to the previous review, the English speaking woman has a standard midwestern American speaking voice and the Spanish speaking man is easy to understand. They cover phrases useful for the traveler, but you do need to use it with the book, which covers all kinds of modern day phrases for many situations, including some elementary grammar so you can personalize your sentences. Especially useful are sections covering different Spanish dialects including Basque and Galacian. Even if you don't attempt to actually speak these dialects, having a reference to road & other signs will be useful if you travel in these areas. The book is very compact and easily fits in a pocket or purse."
5,Excellent resource to be used in several ways.,"Non only is this helpful for church marquees, but can be used in all type of bulletins, newsletters and various other publications.Great for ""thought for the day"" at work or at school.Highly recommend!"
5,Louis L'Amour is One of The Best Writers,"Although most of his stories take place in the Old West, they could take place anywhere, as they are primarily about people and how they relate (or don't) to each other. The settings are authentic, though, and L'Amour is one of the very best storytellers we have had.In the Westerns genre, he is the best, in my opinion, even better than Zane Grey and Max Brand."
4,Unusual Louis L'Amour book,"Gives a good mixture of a character that is new to the west, but is able to put skills learned in the ""city"" to enabling him to do well in the ""West"". As usual, a very consise difference between ""good"" and ""evil"" with a bit of life philosophy thrown into the mix."
4,Follow along,"Well, this fellow sure had a hard time at the start of his life, but Louis L'Amour helps him out. Glad the good guy always wins."
4,It could only last for so long,"This supergroup of sorts (members of No Escape, Rorschach, Die 116, Deadguy, and the list goes on and on and on...) puts down one of the most intense albums of the year. Non-stop brutality, an equal mix of punk rock, hardcore, and metal. With the amount of tension/intensity involved, it might not be too much of a surprise that the band only lasted one demo, one LP, and one 7"". The world might have blown up had they continued. Guitarist Keith Huckins was the first to go, returning back to the east coast. K.I.G. tried to continue, but without Huckins, it would never have been the same. Last I heard, drummer Andrew Gormley joined Today Is The Day."
2,not happy,"this cd is scratched.was not happy with it,two songs on the cd sound bad.i gave it to my friend she wanted it."
4,Tracy Lawrence is the BEST,"Tracy Lawrence is the one who turned me on to country music with his wonderful voice and lyrics. This album is great with ""If the World Had a Front Porch"" and the duet with John Anderson about the ""Hillbilly with a Heartache"" is wonderfully funny. Hopefully Tracy Lawrence will be around for a long time."
1,pig in a poke,Why would anybody want to buy and download anything that doesn't have a description even from its own publisher?
4,If you own horses you should have this book.,Everyone with horses should know basic hoof care. This book will not teach you how to trim or shoe a horse but will give you a good understanding of what your farrier is doing.
5,Song Listings,"Was there ever an Anthology, Vol. 2 for this great group?1. The Weight2. Chest Fever3. I Shall Be Released4. Rag Mama Rag5. The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down6. Up On Cripple Creek7. King Harvest (Has Surely Come)8. Stage Fright9. The Shape I'm In10. Daniel And the Sacred HarpAmazon, you really need to figure out how people can do a search on ""The Band"" without coming up with thousands of suggestions!"
5,Product does everything i purchased it to do.,"I bought the Zinc Citrate to help with my immune system, personally i take two (2) tablets each morning. I have been around people that have the flu and do work outside in all weather rain, snow, and everything else; along with balanced diet I believe this has helped to make my system strong enough to withstand whatever comes my way."
2,this item made me sick,"I took this item because Dr. Oz said its good for allergies but when I took it, it made me soo sick that I couldn't do anything for a month. My toliet was my best friend, and I couldn't stay outside the restroom for long. It gotten soo bad that I went to the doctor and had to get anti-bacterial pills. It is best to stay away from this product.In spite of this terrible ordeal, the experience of others with this product may not be as horrid as mines, but lets just talk about what has happened to me. If you have this product, use with caution or don't use it at all. Whatever we put in your body can help or harm us. We shouldn't gamble with our health.Here is a word of advice;Always ask your doctor before you take any suggestion or supplement base on any television show. So that, you will not experience the hardship I have endured when using this product.Take care Amazon shoppers and Merry Christmas. Please enjoy this new year which is coming soon."
1,only for the uneducated,this movie was very boring and had few facts! more about some spirit space family than about quantum physics! very disappointing! i shut it off 30 minutes into it. Don't waste your time
2,Music too loud - Can't hear comentary,"I typically find this information extremly interesting; however, the background music is so loud that you cannot hear the comentary.I find this to be a common problem with several type of these products.My advice it to read the reviews. Some may be able to overlook but I was not."
2,A dissapointment,"I bought this DVD based on positive reviews, however I personally feel it doesn't live up to expectations of a 2008 film. The DVD mentions reincarnation and past life memories, near death experiences, etc. However, it MENTIONS them, but does not SHOW any evidence, even anecdotal. There are LOTS of cases of past life memories in children, lots of cases of psychic abilities, lots of cases of near death experiences, etc., but this DVD does not interview any of them. The DVD is as it is. What it is however is just a 'story' with no 'characters.'"
3,Back ground music too loud.,"I am sure it was a great DVD. However, the back ground music was so loud that it made it difficult to hear the dialog. I constantly had to turn the volume up and down in order to try understanding the words. Otherwise, it was probably wonderful. I wish their was more understand when it come to people over 60 and 70 years of age, we like to learn also.Dee Rankin, Lexington, NC"
3,"More science, less mystical would have been better!","I love Don Miguel, Fred and Edgar but unfortunately, the females on this DVD offset the scientific data by perpetuating those worn-out memes based on mythology, mysticism and the occult. Too bad the MEN couldn't have launched a production on their own, by themselves, without all that contradictory stuff. Why are people afraid to let go of the past and embrace what quantum particle physics can teach us? There are some golden nuggets in this film that I will attempt to edit out so I can save them and replay them because they are valid and valuable information that needs to be shared but without all that other mystical nonsense."
1,"Vengaboys, think about what you do!","Vengaboys is always saying that they want that the world takes them seriously and they will be biggest pop-band on this Earth. HOW CAN ANYONE TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY if the lyrics are like this? ""Sha la la la la... Sha la la in the morning... Sha la la la la... Sha la la just for you!"" Even babies listen to more grown up music than this! Don't bother! I believe that Vengaboys will soon quit singing these ridiculous songs."
1,A Disappointment!,"I was so excited when I finally got this machine in the mail, but my excitement soon faded. This unit started giving me trouble within a day of using it. It would constantly lock up and would not respond to the buttons on the front panel or the remote. When I tried to do what the manual said to do in cases like these, nothing happened, and when I called technical support for help - they were USELESS. The last straw was when I popped a DVD in the tray and the machine would not play it AND it would not release it. I ended up returning it and getting another brand. Stay away from this machine."
1,DAEWOO IS KOREAN WORD FOR CRAP,Worst piece of electronics I ever purchased. Started acting up almost immediately. Hit rewind and machine shuts down and ejects tape. BUYER BEWARE!!!!
5,"this isn't sometime sunday, but it still jams!","Mikee the x-singer of sometime sunday fronts Tragedy Ann. His vocals are still raspy, but not hardcore. There music really hard. I like sometime sunday better, but these guys still kick butt. There are a few songs with plenty of emotion. Overall the album is really hard and slow. There are a couple songs that are slow and borring. as an overall the album is really good, and it's fun to jam to."
3,"Masterful perfromances, uneven and sometimes shoddy engineering","This set features some truly great performances by the legendary pianist Wilhelm Backhaus. Some of the performances have good sound, but the engineering is very uneven -- sometimes atrocious even on fifties recordings -- and editing is at best indelicate. Poor sound quality costs the set two stars (perhaps should cost three), but at this price one can stand some throwaway material, and it is still not a bad purchase. Backhaus deserves more thoughtful treatment, however."
3,Disappointed...But not with Johnny Cash,"As a keen country fan I had trawled the internet for Johnny Cash's comedy stuff.... Chicken in Black etc......If you want these tracks then don't buy this albumThey're simply NOT on it !!!!It's a good album none the less, but for some reason Amazon include these tracks on their listing.They also list them on another album namely:-"" Bigger than Life Collection""Guess What they're not included here either !If you want these tracks buy: -""A Boy named Sue and other Story Songs"""
4,Charmingly illustrated,"""A City Is"" is a collection of poems about life in New York City throughout the year. Some are charming and resonate well, even with non-city dwellers; others are very New York City-centric. All, however, are just the right length for reading to pre-schoolers.Melanie Hope Greenberg's illustrations have a joyful playfulness that seems to mark her work, and I just love it. She was an excellent choice of illustrator for this book because she can make all the poems in this collection relatable to everyone."
4,Great Story for Kids in the City,"A City Is, is a great story for young children in New York City. While the poems are fun and quick reads, the lack of a plot might make it difficult for some children to follow along. Nevertheless, any child from Manhattan will have seen many of the illustrations. It will be easy for any of these urban children to relate to the story, and they will probably want to share many of their own memories. The changing seasons, diversity, poetry, and city scapes make this book appropriate for a variety of classroom lessons, while the mother and son spread through out the book make it a great bedtime story for families."
5,Awesome,If you liked firefly you will like the movie. Still am hoping to see another movie or the show start up again.
3,Doesn't follow the beauty of the show but it does a decent job.,"If you loved the show, you definitely has to watch this! It's not as good as the show but it does a decent job."
5,Does a good job of tying up some loose ends. AND Agreat movie as a stand alone.,After the untimely demise of the Firefly series this was a really welcome bit of closure.Plus this movie stands alone as a bit of entertainment. Seeing the entire Firefly series makes it betterBUT it is not absolutely needed.
2,"Work well, mirrors cannot be folded after installation","These are a really good idea, but they keep the mirror from folding in. The first trip through the car wash after installation caused one to pop off and be lost. Neat idea, poor execution."
5,Two Thumbs Up!,"The book was a real mind opener for my family and me. It explains how communism is still a threat to America and the plan to divide and conquer. Ask yourself this question. Is America divided? Liberal versus Conservative? Was this by design; or, did it just happen? This book explains by fact and not speculation how indeed it is a carefully crafted plan that is being played out today. A polarized America leaves herself at risk and now Islamic extremists are set to take advantage of this vulnerability. There is still hope though; the author leaves us with a plan to bring us back together. The plan is strikingly simple yet right on target. This book is a must read!!"
2,Dull,"This movie had poor acting, very low budget, and I was bored with the story line. I fell asleep before the movie was over."
1,HORRIBLE!,Do not buy! I regret that I paid $1.00 at Red Box to rent it. This movie was a waste of good talent.
1,Waste of Time,"I made the mistake of seeing this at a theater and regretted it. This movie was so bad me and my date heard someone snoring in the audience. The jokes in the movie were very lame and the plot left alot to be desired. Me and my date had no idea of where this movie was going. During the movie we saw people gather their things and leave, which is what we did shortly later. This movie should have went straight to DVD in the first place, but even that is too good for this waste of time."
1,Suck,"Do not waste your time on this movie, I could not even finish it. I passed it on to my mother and she did not finish it as well."
2,Not that great,Needed something to do to kill time and I decided to watch because of the names in the movie. I remembered seeing the previews on TV and I missed it in the movie theaters. I walked away disappointed and feeling like it should have been so much better. I'm sad this wasn't a better movie--I'm not even sure how it made it to movie theaters.
1,NOT A GOOD MOVIE AT ALL******!!!!,"Very Disappointed! I am a movie Queen! I love Zoe Saldana! But the movie and the characters did not fit at all! It was crazy!! you couldn't tell if one of the guys were having a threesome or wanting a threesome with the other guy girlfriend!It just kept you really confused, it had no certain plot, they were just doing different things! I hate they put my girl Zoe in this pile of mess! So upset I took a chance on this movie! Wish I could get my $16 back."
3,love a movie,this one was fair....not as good as I thought it would be from the previews...the story was weak and I have to say the acting was just fair I have seen some of these actors/actress in other roles where the acting was much better.
5,"A must to see, and add to your movie library","This is a great family story about a family that all had their own agenda's but with the aid of the youngest, the family is brought together to rescue Christmas and find the happiniess as a family, that was missing. Heart warming performances and a well acted movie of the kind that need to be found more often. I added this to my movie library, and enjoy it. If you don't own this one, you should at least rent it, to see why you should buy it."
5,the night before the night before Christmas,I like movie becouse the hole family could watch it. my hole family in enjoyed watching the movie . It shows that you can belive in things . Thair was no bad words in it like most of the movie that are out thair.
3,"Clean Family Fare, a Tad Slow","Another Hallmark Christmas movie with plenty of the right elements but somewhat uninspired.Santa crashes and loses his memory. He takes up residence at a disjointed, not really in the spirit of Christmas, family led by the ever watchable Jennifer Beals. His chief elf(not from 'Elf'), nicely played by Jordan Prentice, works with the family to try to help Santa get it together in time for you know what.The family is too tied up in their work and own affairs to appreciate the meaning of the season and each other. Finding their way to togetherness in mildly amusing ways is the predictable nature of this made for TV flick.Our kids liked the reindeer but were quick to say, ""That's not how Santa really is."" Perhaps his slight accent, lack of more jolliness(of course, he did lose his memory) and lack of more rotundness dampened their review.It's clean and well meaning but not super funny or novel. I'd say enjoy it for what it is. Merry Christmas!"
4,A Very Different Christmas Story.,What would you do if a man dressed as Santa Clause fell off the roof and awakened with amnesia? This family had some very real challenges in trying to establish the man's identity.
5,Christmas Movie Fan,I purchased this movie for myself to enjoy for the christmas season!! This movie is enjoyable for the whole family!!
1,DEFECTIVE GARBAGE,"In less than 2 years and with limited use, we had the same ""red blinking light of death"" where it will not power on, just like several others have described."
1,Two failures in 2 years... don't buy this tv.,"Bought this product in April 2007. Within 2 months, the main board failed and was replaced under warranty. In March 2009, I got what is starting to become known as the red blinks of death. The TV wouldn't turn on. The tech told me that Philips manufactured the device with a resistor of the wrong resistance and they are aware of the issue but won't issue a recall or offer to repair. With parts and labor, this cost several hundred dollars. I won't buy another Philips TV."
1,Phillips 37in Ambilight,"I purchased this TV in Dec 06 at a retail store. Like many other's I have had the same problem. The TV will no longer power on and shows a flashing red light. The unit wasn't used heavily but still managed to give up after the warranty, I was lucky enough to purchase the extended warranty but go figure seems like a lot of these units fail from other reviews. When I searched it is true, this is a common problem. Great picture, Ambilight was very cool, but too bad it doesn't work."
1,RIP Dec 06 - Mar 08,"I bought this TV back in December of 06 and it just died March 08! I was watching TV one night and the next day it would not turn on, I would just get a flashing red light. I am told its a faulty signal board or power board. I see other people have had the same problem after the same amount of time of owning the TV. I am not sure if its even worth repairing.....I would not recommend this TV."
4,*edit (5 years later) AMBILIGHT ROCKS,"Its been 5 years no problems - i leave it on alot even through the night alot. It busted today - smells like smoke and turned off. Its been a good 5 years, no issues except the crappy sound (but i have surround sound) I'm gunna miss ya AMBILIGHT - old friend Jan 2007 - Feb 2012Original post:I'm totally obessed with ambilight. i love it.had the tv for almost 2 months now...dont know about the overheating thing people talk about.baseball games with ambilight is so nice..the green field goes all behind the tv......1 major fault is the SOUND. It is really bad. Really bad. Your going to need surround sound. I play dvds on my PS2 and i have to bring the sound up to around 95 out of 100."
3,disapointed,"It would be nice if you could post the samples to the songs of this cd so that shoppers can hear what the songs are like.I've been looking for the song ""ven junto a mi"" by Claudio and I finally find it and I can't even hear a portion of the song.Very disapointing!"
1,too big,Forget the 7/16ths mentioned. This wrench is a FULL half inch. If it were 7/16ths it would have worked for the 3/8 bed bolt that I have. I emailed the seller and got no reply. I returned the bed wrench AND THEY ARE STILL RUNNING A CREDIT CARD CHARGE AGAINST ME. TERRIBLE PEOPLE.
4,"It's good, but the tomato and spinach flavors aren't very strong.","Riceselect makes a really nice couscous. This variety is quite good and does present well on a plate. That same tri-color effect, however, may be off-putting to picky (young) eaters who might otherwise have thought it was just little bitty pasta balls (and eat them all up). Can you tell one of our family ""littles"" refused to even try it? I honestly feel that couscous is best when paired with veggies of any kind. I've used canned and frozen vegetables as well as fresh. There's little to no added nutritional value to this variety over the traditional style and there is nothing like the extra boost you get from using real food instead of ""flavors"". It is pretty though, so it does make an attractive salad. If you're a carb lover, couscous has a fairly low GI, making it an entry on the allowable foods list for diabetics. Also, try the organic varieties that Riceselect offers - they are scrumptious!"
3,Ultra Plug male,Product is what it is and does what it does. It's a good price for what you get. Not much more you can say about a very simple item.
1,highway robbery,This doesn't work on my video and I live in Europe! :(I'm utterly gutted as one cannot return purchases once they are opened. From what planet is that? Are we a magician or something that we can conclude whether purchases will work or not without opening?!!!!
1,"""Cannot Play This Format""....","I have two Region-A/1 bluray players.I bought my first player from U.S.A.and bought one more from sony in South Korea.But both player couldn't play this title.I saw the same message when I played ""Girls Aloud - Bluray"" bought from Amazon.Maybe, these titles are imported from U.K. using region code : B/2."
1,No image at all,"I thought the four previous reviews were fluke but I was wrong and they were right. DON'T BUY THIS DISK AT ALL, and spare yourself a trip to the post office and the hassle of having to return it. Just too bad no one cares, I would still love to own a Hi Def live video of Keane."
3,Okay for me,"the audio and video quality could be better...it is just okay for me. I did like the angle shots and closeups though, these were good..."
5,Rockstar Energy,This energy drink keeps me moving. When working Third shift it is so hard to keep the mind awake. Rockstar gives the boost my body needs with all the Vitamins and the kick of a Cola!
3,Good Energy. Baaaaddd Taste (Blegh!),"So I'm a big fan of Rock Star Energy Drinks . . .Well . .Let me specify . .I'm a big fan of the Original Rock Star Energy Drink (Citrus-flavored). Why? Because it pumps me up AND it tastes wonderful. This, Double-Energy crud, may pump me up even more (which is not exactly the best thing when I'm just about to go to class),but it tastes awful . .It tastes like that horrible cough medicine that was given to you as a kid. ... Yes . . . It's THAT bad . . .So,unless you REALLY need the energy, I'd suggest sticking to the original . . ."
1,The worst shipping company,"they shipped it to me i give them that, but i got 18 of 24 cans and 8 was busted so very crappy shipping and rip off"
2,Interesting performances of unknown concertos,Giuseppe Martucci flourished in the second part of the 19th century and was one of very few Italian composers of symphonic music during that period. His two piano concertos are played well by Jeffrey Swann. The orchestra of Montpelier (France) sounds rather provincial in these performances. Massimo de Bernart's conducting is servicable. Recommended to those who love late romantic concertos.N. A. Peppas
5,The song never grows old,"I have the original 45 for the song Ramaya. When I play it for friends, they usually laugh and say ""Where the heck did you get THAT?"" After the joking around is done, they find themselves humming the song later. It's a catchy tune. I can't believe they've released it on CD. If they ever come out with it, I will surely buy it. Listen to it once and you will be HOOKED! If you remember the fun you had with the popular old Herman's Hermits numbers, you'll love Afric Simone on Ramaya. It's pure fun!"
4,Buena novela,"Es una buena novela. Bien escrita como todo lo de Follet, sin ser la mejor, vale la pena leerla...Siempre entretenido."
3,5-STAR MEN WITH 1-STAR WOMEN,"Zip3's review pretty much says it all. The men were heroes and the women were zeroes, although Honey was more(barely)likeable than Misty. And while ten-year age differences work in historicals, they don't hold up well in contemporaries. Supposedly, these two sisters came from a privileged background, yet they acted more like escapees from Dogpatch. The Morgan-Misty story was particularly painful. I've enjoyed Lori Foster's other efforts like TOO MUCH TEMPTATION and THE WINSTON BROTHERS, but save your money on this one."
2,The worst,"This is definitly the worst in the entire Bond series. This is only a remake of Thunderball and they did a [bad] job of it. It didn't even have that circle at the very beginning when 007 turns around and shoots and then blood comes down (you have to know what I mean if you've seen another 007 flick other than this one). Plus they didn't have a scene before the theme song. Thunderball is much better. The acting I suppose is OK, and some of the action was enjoyable. Those are the only reasons I gave it an extra star. But this doesen't even belong in the 007 series. Don't buy this. Buy Octopussy (realeased the same year, 1983) instead."
1,Never Say Never Again.,"It was a great disappointment. My husband and I are avid Bond fans and have collected all the James Bond films with two exceptions: the newest one, Skyfall, not in DVD form yet and Never Say Never Again. After looking in all available local stores, decided to try Amazon and was delighted to find it. It was right before Christmas and since it didn't arrive in time, I typed and laminated the tittle, placed in a gift wrapped box and gave to husband for Christmas. An IOU. On New Years Eve, we got the DVD, sat down to watch it, full of happy expectations and it would not play. We did not know about ""Regions"". We bought it from Amazon or an Amazon approved vendor and didn't expect to buy a bootleg item. We were very unhappy. I returned it, of course, and we are still looking for Never Say Never Again, thought not on line. We have always been pleased with Amazon so we'll continue shopping there but will be a little more careful."
3,Well worth the watching,"Excellent enemy in this film, and Connery although being 53 in this film pulls it off. It's something to see a 53 year old Bond with a 30 year old Basinger, but it the movie works, and well worth watching in its totality. Basically, a fun movie and easy to follow."
4,dvd,This went well with the rest of our collection that i bought my husband for xmas this year thank you
5,As Good as I Expected,Here we are at the end of 2012. I noted that scenes missing comments were from 10 and 12 years ago. The copy that I just watched is complete. Good quality. The only thing I wonder about is the opening titles. But of course this is not EON. I am glad I bought it. I wanted all of them. (Including Niven's Casino Royale) Five stars for meeting expectations.
4,Still a Bond film...,"Though not officially part of the James Bond series, and even though it is a rough update of ""Thunderball"", your 007 collection isn't complete without it. It is currently overpriced to buy on DVD or bluray, as it is out of circulation, but it was well priced to buy through Amazon for instant movies. I watched it in HD through my Xbox 360 on my big screen TV. It ran perfectly. I was happy to see this option as there is no way I was going to overpay for a physical copy. If the price comes back down, I would still buy one though to complete my Bond collection."
3,Well this is not the best Bond movie. But then not every Bond movie can be the best Bond movie.,"It's good though, despite the mixed reviews. I also found it interesting to see Kim Basinger when she was thirty years old. Being an (ex) scholar on nuclear weapons made me giggle not a little for the awkward procedures and handling of the nukes... but heck it's a movie!A bit sad at the end of the movie to hear Connery, while kissing Kim Basinger, replying ""Never again!"" when an emissary of his boss asks him to go back to work as the service is not the same without him. Well so it was the final appearance of the best Bond ever!Missing at the beginning is the traditional gun barrel sequence, as this is (the only one) not produced by Eon Productions."
3,Remake better than Thunderball -- but...,"While this remake of Thunderball is better in story development and action than the original, it lacks the technical genius of the Broccoli films. Kim Basinger can't act, can't dance, and is having a bad hair day throughout the movie. On the other hand Barbara Carrera is one of the great Bond villians. More importantly, like they said way back in the sixties -- Sean Connery IS James Bond and that's never changed."
4,"A good action flick starring ""THE"" James Bond.","As a Bond ""freak"", I'll watch (almost) any 007 flick once. Although NEVER is an obvious remake of THUNDERBALL, how can anyone miss seeing Sean Connery one last {?} time in the role he perfected. As always, the Bond girls are delicious, and the villans are , well, really nasty {I think I dated Fatima Blush in a previous lifetime}.My only regret is that the video is not currently available; with a copy Ireally could NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN."
3,Why make Thunderball again?,"When I seen this movie for the first time I wondered why all of a sudden he(Sean Connery) wants to do another 007 movie? This movie I liked because I thought it had a better planning than the orignal Thunderball but he should have done one on his own and not make a remake. And Sean, never say never again."
2,Thunderball Knockoff,"The Never Say Never Again movies is a knockoff of the better Bond movie Thunderball. In this one SPECTRE steals necular bombs and holds the world hostage (as always) and Bond Save the world (again). It includes A M that is 30 years younger than Robert Brown, and A Q that (I think) also played in the Hunchback of Notre Dame. Overall if you want to get this movie, Save your money and get Thunderball! Afterall It isn't really a true bond Movie."
4,007 is always fun,"Yes, I know it is a remake of Thunderball. The improvements in color, and style are worth the investment. Great addation to my 007's."
4,This movie is a lot of fun - Lots of Unfair reviews,"I had a great time watching Connery playing Bond again. Good action, good humor. Sexy, dangerous girls and a terrific villian played by Klaus. Anyone who loves Connery wil love this movie. Ignore the naysayers who are probably mostlyGeneration X'ers."
4,Good Product - Great Price,I have always been a James Bond fan especially the ones with Sean Connery. I was happy with the way this particular one was converted to Bluray. It was very well done.
3,The return of Sean Connery as Bond,"It was good to finally have a clean, crisp copy of this unique piece of Bond paraphernalia. The commentary was enlightening & the extras so-so but well worth having in the collection. This is a work often jealously overlooked because it was not part of the franchise per se. If you're a Connery as Bond fan then its a must."
2,Not that good...,"I was really disappointed by this movie. In my opinion, it is the worst James Bond movie ever made. It is a remake of an earlier Sean Connery movie, Thunderball, which is a far, far superior 007 movie. This movie has an overall bland feeling to it because no one really seemed to care when making it. Connery was great as James Bond in the 1960s, but in this movie, he is much too old for the part. And since the movie was not made by MGM/UA, you don't get the usual actors portraying Q or M. I really don't think I'll watch this movie again. Stick with the original Sean Connery or Roger Moore James Bond movies."
2,Great movie....lousy blu-ray master,"So it's a non-canon movie....it was my 2nd favorite, behind Goldfinger. To heck with the purists. It has Sean Connery.My comments are focused on the lousy video quality for a blu-ray movie. It's really no better than my standard DVD copy. The master copy must be somewhat lousy, or the technician was an amateur. I swear I could have done a better job myself at creating the conversion. If I'd known that---I wouldn't have spent my $23.95 on this copy.But at least this one doesn't suffer the Samsung BD-P1200 no-play bug."
3,the film quality is not so good,"the movie is good itself, but the dvd quality is not. Maybe it is too old, needed to be remastered."
1,An Entire Scene Is MISSING from this DVD,"Did anyone out there who bought this DVD or reviewed it take the time to watch it? There is an entire scene missing from it!After James Bond crashes the formal gala affair and leaves the doorman in the coatroom, the film jumps directly to the video duel between Largo and Bond. The scene in between is missing. That scene is where Bond surprises Domino. She had previously seen him at the health spa where he gave her a rub down, she thinking he was a member of the staff. The scene that is missing is where Bond introduces himself to her and she stumbles over her lines ordering a ""Bloody Mary with plenty of Worchester sauce.""For that significant omission I can not recommend this DVD. Also, other than the trailer there are no extras on this DVD. The aesthetic qualities of this film speak for themselves."
1,Never Buy This Version Of Never Say Never Again,"If you haven't bought this DVD yet,don,t. If you have,return it.There is over 4 minutes missing from this presentation which makes no sense at this point in the story.It absolutly ruins the enjoyment of the movie.The people responsible for the transfer to DVD were lazy and unprofessional.Don't accept this.Let MGM know we won't buy inferior product.If everyone returns this movie they may take more care in the future."
3,Missing Scenes On DVD,"The video transfer to DVD was fine, however, between chapters 19 and 20 there are a number of contiguous scenes missing. All the missing scenes are during the Charity Ball Sequence. From the scene where Bond leaves the Security Man in the closet holding the cigarette case to the scene where Bond, Domino and Largo are entering the Game for the big play-off scene. The initial scene between Largo and Bond is missing. Once bought you must email mgm requesting a replacement, which you will get after you return the original disk to them. This disk is still being sold online - and there is no current way to tell if the disk has the missing scenes."
3,"Not a ""real"" Bond movie, but still entertaining.","This is the remake of ""Thunderball"", the Bond story that Danjaq and Eon didn't own the film rights to. So because it was made by another company, it doesn't have the classical Bond opening, the James Bond theme or the usual actors in the parts of M, Q and Moneypenny. In other words, it doesn't quite have the Bond ""feeling"". But it's still an entertaining action-adventure. Sean Connery still knows how to play James Bond and Klaus Maria Brandauer is very good as the villain. I can recommend it"
3,"Should Connery have said ""never again""?","In 1983, right when Roger Moore had been welcome as 007 to audiences, the word was out: ""Sean Connery IS James Bond in: Never Say Never Again"". But this film leaves a question: should Connery have said ""never again""?This film is basically a remake of 1965's ""Thunderball"". It was based on a story by Jack Whittingham, Kevin McClory and Ian Fleming, as was Thunderball, and it tells of two hijacked warheads and how the evil Maximillian Largo (originally Emilio) hides them. Okay, I might have confused you, but this film will occasionally leave you confused. It's alright, but doesn't really have the adventurous feeling of the other James Bond films.This was my first DVD, and it was a good one to begin with. It has the general DVD stuff: feature presentation, interactive menus, and a theatrical trailer, plus scene selections. That's about all this DVD has to offer. Oh well! The picture is good, and the sound is OK/good. Out of 5: 3.8"
3,Never but again ?,"When Sean Connery Left his role of james bond after diamonds are forever, he say ""Never Say Never Again"". But Nobody is perfect so he accept in 1983 to make a new james bond movie which is in fact a remake of the fourth james bond ""Thunderball"". The film is good, like the actors, but the problem is that this movie is not made by EON productions (the producters of all james bond movies), that mean that there is no james bond music, no Q, no gunbarrel, no good song etc... If had to choose between Never Say Never Again or Octopussy (the official bond in 83) i will choose this last, because there is ll the ingredient of a bond movie. But if you are a james bond fan like me, you must see this movie, because Sir Sean Connery is in, and this is the big point of this film. ENJOY !"
1,(james bond fan & collector) NEVER WATCH IT AGAIN,"This flim is awful its the worst sean connery bond flim ever made.Its not realy a proper Bond flim. Instead of calling it Never Say Never Again it should be renamed Never Watch It Again. Its suposed to be a remake of Thunderball, but its not its nothing like Thunderball.It's that terrible it should not realy get one star."
3,ho-hum bond,"not one of my favorite bond flicks - and i consider myself a fan. an interesting cast with carerra being the most fun. starting with the name (fatima blush) and ending with a pair of smoking shoes.for those of you haven't seen this, it's a remake of thunderball. names have been changed (but not very much) and the locale is in some different places. the producers wanted to make a bond flick, but only had the rights to thunderball.since it wasn't part of the normal producing team, you notice the missing elements - the biggest being the lack of the monty norman james bond theme. a lot of the music is somewhat cheesey as are many of the special effects. not quite sure why they made this film - other than the opportunity to watch a noticeably older, huffing and puffing connery try to prove that he's still an action hero (sorry folks, he isn't).probably worth it for the die-hard fans, but i place this up there with those other bonds that haven't aged as well as some of the others."
3,Region 2,"The movie itself is good enough. What I didn't understand was that Region 2 means that it's from another country and cannot play on my DVD player, but it can play on my computer after I adjust the settings."
3,Sean Connery's last Bond flick,"This is the last and final film with Sean Connery as James Bond. He's aged a bit but there's nothing wrong with that. The script is not top notch. A little on the cheesy side. There are some scenes under water which look alot like Thunderball. Thunderball was still much better than this. If you're a big James Bond fan then you should get this. If you're a casual fan then maybe this is not for you. Hard to say. I did enjoy it, it just wasn't as good as other James Bond films. Like I think the best James Bond ever would have to be ""You Only Live Twice"". Then comes From Russia with Love, then second is Thunderball, Then third favorite was Goldfinger, then Dr. No. The worst was Timothy Dalton. The two films he made were so poorly written and poorly performed that I have to wonder, what went wrong? This is an adequate bond film and is worth giving a look at."
3,Blu Rays don't work on older DVDs,"I should have known it, but bought it in a hurry for a gift.It should be made clear in the product description part."
1,Never Say Never Again DVD PAL format.,"Unfortunately, when the DVD was ordered the Region 2 format did not mean anything to me. On receipt I realized the format was PAL not NTSC which means the DVD is for playing in Europe not the USA. The seller should not be allowed to advertise a PAL format product in the USA."
1,This Moive Stinks,The resons this moive stinks 1. Sean Connery is way to old.2.This is not like TunderBall shusss. So I gave This moive 1 star. BEWARE JAMES BOND FANS.
2,Ever saiy never again,"A bad movie, with a good james bond 007. This remake is not a real bond movie, there is not the original bond cast and makers. Sean Connery and Bernie Casey are the only good actors in this movie."
1,"I Never want to see ""Never Say Never Again"" again.","From the dreadful opening, showing Sean Connery's age, to the lack of gunbarrel intro, THIS IS NOT BOND. There is a reason that this is not considered to be an actual 007 film, and the abscence of Bond's theme music shows it. This is more like a B-reel to Thunderball (using old character names, plots and locations). Very weak."
1,"never say ""i wanna see this movie""","never say never is almost as bad as on her majestys secret service.this poor attempt to remake thunderball is awful,no gun barrel scene in which all bond movies start out.they talk about bond being old,a diffrent m,moneypenny,and q.blofeld is diffrent too.see thunderball."
1,The Fake Bond,"There are two problems with ""Never Say Never Again."" The first is that it is a bad movie. The acting (including Connery) is sub-par, and the action leaves something to be desired. However, the main problem is that this is a cheap knock-off James Bond movie. A remake of ""Thunderball,"" the fourth film installment, ""Never Say Never Again"" is not released through United Artists, and was not produced by Albert Broccoli or his company, EON Productions. A true Bond fan knows this, and any interested party will notice the absence of 007 trademarks such as the gun-barrel opening and the truly artistic title sequence. In fact, ""Never Say Never Again"" was released as competition for ""Octopussy,"" the 13th 007 flick, in 1983. So, plain and simple, if you want a good version of the story, buy the orgional ""Thunderball."""
2,The film is better than this DVD shows!,"As this is review number 124 I didn't care to read everyone's opinion regarding this movie. Overall I think it's a decent film, leaning further to the campy style than Connery had in his previous Bond films. I own a widescreen video and the widescreen dvd. I kept the video for one good reason:THE DVD VERSION IS EDITED!When Bond enters the casino after disposing of the tubby bouncer with a cigarette case (or bomb with a tino gyroscope) the entire scene where he meets Domino (playing Centapede) is gone! As is the following scene where he buys her a drink (another ""Hard or soft?"" moment), as is the next scene when Largo meets Bond and invites him to play Domination with him! This entire sequence is cut! Why? I don't know. Maybe Atari objected.If you insist on buying every James Bond dvd, by all means, buy it. But be warned: you're not seeing the entire movie!"
2,NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN,"Bond, not at his best. There are a few scenes worth watching, but overall it is a bit boring. It was nice to see Connery in the role that he made famous however the villan was dull,the musical score was awful, and the gadgets lame. Also the DVD version is missing about 15 minutes of the movie (when Bond enters the casino and subdues the doorman it skips right to the video game scene and deletes the entire first meeting between Bond and Largo). Stick with the Broccoli/Saltzman Bond for first rate action and adventure."
4,GREAT MOVIE!,"It has a stupid title. but honestly I think its better than the origional Thunderball. Actually its a remake of it. Kim Basinger did a wonderful job as ""Domino"". I liked how the director toyed with the fact that James Bond is older than he was in the 60's. It all together turned out to be a wild, thrilling, action packed Connery film."
1,You should be ashamed!,"It's missing a chapter, you be allowed to sell this for $66.00. Get a conscience!! Where are your ethics. SHAMEFUL"
2,"sadly....""Stirred not shaken""","By no means a great bond movie....but not a complete flop either, I had to have it for the series (sigh!)...but will I watch it again...probably not. An adequate digital transfer, okay sound....but not a scratch on the real Bond franchise"
3,Connery Shines,"This film is flawed in many respects. It's too long, the action sequences seem to drag on with little tension, and the soundtrack is depressing. Given these flaws how can the film succeed? Answer: Sean Connery. Connery brings warmth (Bond has mellowed some with age) and wit to the Bond character who is facing middle-age and the late Cold War era. He is also helped by an excellent supporting cast."
1,Dumb and Dumber Actresses,"Whether by direction or lack of script, these two women are terrible in this movie. I know its camp but man, this was bad. At least I could have laughed through it."
4,good movie,"i learned some new things about james bond and its beginings that i didnt know before i saw this movie, i reccomend this movis for any james bond fan."
1,the worst Bond ever!,"this had to have been the absolutely dumbest 007 film i have seen! The cast was pleasing but the original movie, THUNDERBALL, was tens of hundreds of times better! the intro was tickling but not innovative enough. The cool suaveness Sean Connery had in the earlier films was not apparent. All in all, this was a weak attempt to update one of the best 007 films in history, which of course was ""Thunderball"""
1,Uhh...Okay?,"I have just recently just started watching the Bond movies. Goldfinger, The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, etc. This is supposed to be a remake of the Bond Classic Thunderball. I prefer Thunderball much more than this. I wanted this movie to end since the first scene. This was almost like an Austin Powers movie. I prefer the other Bond competition that year, Octopussy. Here's a list what's different from Thunderball...THUNDERBALL Locations: 75% Nassau, 2% Bahamas, 3% France, & 20% of the South of England.NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN Locations: 10% Nassau, 2% Bahamas, 3% MI6 Training Area, 15% Africa.THUNDERBALL Villian: Age - 50 (Eyepatch)NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN: Age - 35 (Both Eyes)THUNDERBALL: ***1/2NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN: BOMB (thank god this wasn't an official bond)"
2,Um...,"I have no idea why they even spent the money to shoot this film. Sean Connery is a great actor, but he was too old for this role. It's a forgettable remake of Thunderball (which was a good movie) that had me falling asleep. James Bond doesn't have grey hair. The older Sean Connery movies were the best, but you should pass this one up."
1,Should not have been made,"I got depressed while watching this picture because I missed the quality of the previous Bonds which were made by producer Cubby Broccoli and EON productions. Missing are a teaser in the beginning and afterwards a catchy tune sung by a big name singer while the credits role. There are no clever quips said by Bond. The scenery is boring. The only good thing I can say about this picture is the first rate cast - Sean Connery, Max Von Sydow, Klaus Maria Brandauer, and for the girls, Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera - who played an excellent villainess and deserved better. It would have been interesting to see all those actors in an EON production."
3,a genuinely medicore re-make (with the same bond!),"I am sure that there was some bizarre legal reason why they had to re-use the plot of Thunderball -even with the same names - for Connery's return. While I grew up on Connery's Bond and think he is by far the best (just like 60s rock is the best!!), it is beyond me why they couldn't come up with something more original for his swan song. Roger Moore just could NEVER measure up to Connery, who is a wonderful actor, believable yet under-stated, and always adding creative detail. Unfortunately, this is so tightly scripted and directed that little of Connery's creativity comes through. The result is a plodding re-hash, really exactly the same story, just updated with suitably nubile younger women. (Bassinger and Carrera are indeed wonderful and alluring, and Connery isn't awful, but he alks through this rather indifferently). It is just that I had hoped for much much more."
4,Very like Thunderball but still great,I think connery looks a bit old but he stills makes a great performance i really enjoyed the bike chase. If you like bond get it if you dont get it anyway.
1,PAST HIS PRIME,come on people sure its the return of the original and best bond but he was way past his prime even in diamonds are forever..and there isnt no fight scene or gun battle at the end but a video game battle wtf is that..this isnt an offical bond film and it shows..
1,Let's get the facts straight,"The movie was released by Warner Brothers, not MGM. I work for MGM and frankly our operators are tired of hearing complaints about the dvd version being bad when we had nothing to do with it....."
1,boring,a stupid movie i used to like sean connery but this movie i hate him in this movie the dont show the gun barrel the song is (crummy) and is weird and thunderball is better than never say never again
2,Why was this movie made?,"It took me a while, not being a rabid Bond fan, to realize that this was a re-make of Thunderball. Ok, Sean Connery starred in the excellent film, Thunderball. So, some director pulls him out of mothballs to make another ""bond"" film. Ok, WHY REMAKE A FILM SEAN ALREADY STARRED IN? It makes no sense at all. They didn't even change the plot or the character's names. When hollywood rips off shakespeare plots like ""hamlet"" at least they change names and add/remove stuff. If Sean was to make one last bond film, why couldn't they pick a film he never made, like a Roger Moore bond flick, or a new plot entirely? This movie is senseless and stupid. The only redeeming points are seeing Kimmie basinger in her hot outfits, and seeing her underwater in scuba gear. Also, there is a scene where she is to be sold off as a white slave, that's interesting to contemplate, as the arab creepy guys count out their coins to purchase her! Forget this movie, and go get Thunderball."
3,Never say never again,This movie is not recognised as a James Bond film. But it is a great movie as it slots into all the other James Bond films. ENJOY
1,BAD!!!!!!!!!,"OKAY, WHATS GOING ON HERE! HUMM, LETS SEE, WE HAVE ABSOLUTLY NO ORIGINAL ACTORS OF THE NORMAL CHARACTERS LIKE Q AND M, DOESN'T EVEN START WITH THE GUN BARREL, HAS A STORY THATS BEEN USED PROBABLY 100 TIMES ALLREADY AND A BOND THAT JUST CAN'T CUT IT ANNYMORE! THE ONLY SLIGHT GOOD PART TO THIS WAS THE FACT THAT SEAN SONERY WAS IN IT! THATS IT! IF YOU'R A BOND FAN, TRUST ME, YOU DONT NEED THIS ONE IN YOU'R COLLECTION!"
1,(james bond fan & collector) NEVER WATCH IT AGAIN,"This flim is awful its the worst sean connery bond flim ever made.Its not realy a proper Bond flim. Instead of calling it Never Say Never Again it should be renamed Never Watch It Again. Its suposed to be a remake of Thunderball, but its not its nothing like Thunderball."
2,Mediocre production,"A mediocre movie. The production values are poor, the lighting looks like a TV soap opera, Sean Connery phones in a flat performance, Barbara Carrera is laughable, the story jumps around, barely hanging together. I give Kim Basinger credit for delivering a fairly dignified performance in the midst of disaster; Edward Fox, who is capable of a good dramatic performance, and whom I typically like, plays M as a clown.I'm content to own a copy, because it was the only Bond I didn't already have, but I don't know whether I'll ever bother to watch it again."
2,bland!,"To begin, I'd like to state I love Connery's 007 in the 60's.But the 80's weren't good to him. He really looks out of shape in this film. I'll take Moore 'Octopussy' anyday over this. The DVD I watched INCLUDES the deleted scene everyone's been stinkin' about in these reviews. On the positive side, I quite enjoyed seeing the CENTIPIDE arcade machine in its original form. Yes, I'm an 80's geek!"
2,Superspy Supertoupe,"Bond meets old age, Sean Connery deserves an award for the Worst hairpiece in cinema history, really, I think he has a dead chiwawa on his head. This film was released to try and rival the then sitting Bond Roger Moore and it lost dismally. Never a serious rival to Moore, Connery sends himself up in rather unnecessary style, rather reminiscant of Roger Moore in the Cannonball Run. This by the way is a remake of THUNDERBALL, the only Bond script Kevin McCleary owns the rights to. And wait for it there are plans to remake this. Again with Sean Connery, assumedly now in a nursing home, Bond fans everywhere unite...DONT DO IT KEVIN!"
2,Sorry James,"Say Never Again Sean Connery on making a Bond movie without the right directors. It was most crappy Bond movie I ever seen. And I love Sean Connery as James Bond . 'Never Say Never Again ', is 2 thumbs down . Sorry Sir James."
2,Poor Remake,"Sean Connery still has its charm, but he seems more like the aging high school football hero who has to live in the memory of his past glory. This film is a remake of the 1965 Bond film Thunderball. The original movie was much better in every way. The music in this film is very poor, the acting is mediocre and quite honestly the movie is way too long and dull. The changes made in the script don't help it, but rather hurt it. It is worth a passing glance if only to make you appreciate his other Bond films."
4,One of the best James Bonds,"I think this James Bond movie is one of the best in the collection. I have this at my house in VHS, but I am getting this movie on DVD when it comes out to complete my DVD collection of James Bond."
3,To the chap who's not sure who released this film,"Although the first release was WB, the DVD and the errors contained on it are a product of MGM. Quite infact, two links into the MGM.com site revealed the disc for sale. Unfortunatley, they are somewhat confused as to who is responsible over there as well. As a film it may be lacking in some departments, but the least we can do is get the opportunity to see it in its entirety."
1,Very Sloppily Produced Disc,"Never Say Never Again is not one of the worst Bond films, but its simply mediocre and of the standard of all the Bond movies produced after their glory days of the 60 and 70's. However the worst aspect of the DVD version is not the film itself but the lack of quality control that went into making this DVD edition. Unexcusable is the fact that the makers of this DVD couldn't even bother to include the entire film on this disc! There is at least one large missing scene (i.e., just before the 'domination game' section of the film in the casino) and there may be others. Given this and the lack of any extras (save a trailer) makes this a disc to avoid. My advice to fans is to pass up on this edition and wait for a more definitive version in the future."
3,blu ray was done poorly,"Unfortunately this decent bond movie was not cleaned up for blu ray release , unlike the other bond movies out on blu ray. There is dirt and scratches present and they could have cleaned these up easily. There is no excuse for this. The colors are not vibrant , but they were not shot on the best of film as I have read. So the color issue is a minor one, it's the damn scratches and dirt. That's not ACCEPTABLE on blu ray. As for the movie, many hate this one as it's a remake of 'thunderball"", I don't , It was a hit movie back then in the 80's because it's a decent movie. This has no missing scenes at least. And AMAZON needs to seperated blu ray and dvd releases. But they won't and it's lame. But what can you do? I would give the blu ray 2 stars alone, but the movie is enjoyable still and Deserves more stars so I settled on three stars."
4,Doesn't take itself too seriously.,"...which is much more than I can say about the vast majority of the Brosnan Bonds -- which is unfortunate as Pierce had such a great sense of humor in Remington Steele. Never Say Never again does not have any of the trappings of the Ken Adam/John Barry masterpieces, but if you just accept it for what it is, and follow Connery's lead, it's pretty fun!And there are some fabulous things in the film. Klaus Maria Brandauer gives one of the best performances ever as a Bond villain, and his torture-laden video game is brilliant. Some of the location work is excellent, as is the final set. Barabara Carrerra and Bond have a fabulous last scene together. Wrap it all up in a mega-camp theme song and Connery winking at the camera... you just gotta roll with it."
1,Neither a comedy nor an action,"The film was far below expectations. Connery was too old and compare to his natural Bond movies he was a pale old Bond who wasn't in style at all. Largo's character was also a wrong choice- the actor was too mild and comic for Largo, especially ugly was a scene where Bond and Largo played a computer-game: instead of showing ""serious"" Bond making high bets on casino , the scene seemed to be made for kids who enjoy computers. I even don't understand if the film was a plage, comedy or did the producers really want to produce a cheap action where just a name Bond sells high profits. Rowan ""Bean"" Atkinson didn't also fit to his part. Finally, the good thing is that the movie I call Connery's worst is not officially listed as a Bond movie."
1,Displeased,I was very dispaleased with the item I order on line. When I received the tape it was loose in the case as if it was broken. The tape does not work in my cd player or any other cd player. I have ordered from you before but this is the first time this has ever happen to me.
3,not for me,"I found out I don't really like ""gospel"". I like the contemporary christian music much better. Nothing wrong with the quality of the cd or the music though - it's just not my style."
3,WWF Wrestling's Fan Favourite Matches,This video has almost everybody who was competing in the WWF in 1992. Matches include a great six-man tag team match with the Undertaker and the Legion of Doom taking on the Beverly Brothers and the Mountie. The Macho Man versus the Berzerker.

3,IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,"I like R. and Jay....but with this album they could have came out stronger. Tracks 13 and 7 are vintage R.Kelly and Jay Z but as you try to get a feel for the project you feel like they're trying to recreate ""Fiesta"" all over again and like the saying goes you can never go back. All and all, a solid project but I know they could have done better."
2,...,"I like Jay-Z, and R kelly can be good ..., but this is awful and made strictly for the money and reflects the music industry's current state......in dire needs of originality."
1,[Yuck]!,"There aren't many Rap albums that are so bland and unlistenable like this failed collaboration project really is. Both of the artists who were involved in this flop are talented, too bad none of it is shown on this CD. Every song is just totally awful. Avoid this album. If you like Jay Z, Get ""The Blueprint"" or ""Hard Knock Life"" instead. For R.Kelly, brushing aside the legal problem, get ""12 Play"" and ""T2.com"" instead. ""Best Of Both Worlds"" is just [bad]. Jay Z and R. Kelly are both better than this! End of story!"
1,THE WORST ALBUM OF THE YEAR.,This pile of crap deserved to flop because it was made just to make more money off of jay z fans.All the songs sound the same and the beats are lame.Only mindless jay z fans would purchase such an awful cd.STAY AWAY FROM THIS GARBAGE!!!
4,HIP HOP MEETS R N B,"THE COLLABO WAS GREAT AND WELL ACCCEPTED...MANY MAY THINK ITS NOT CLASSIC BUT ACCUALLY, IT IS...WHY? FIGURE IT OUT... THE TITLE EXPLAINS IT ALL.BEST OF BOTH WORLDS"
2,Don't be fooled,"This comes from a fan who has followed R. Kelly since Public Announcement and Jay-Z since Reasonable Doubt. What should have been a legendary collaboration -- an album full of breathtaking beats and innovative lyrics -- instead turned into a rehash of everything that's bad about hip-hop: recycled lyrics, the same preproduced beats and the obligatory references to Cristal, Money and the irresistable pull of the female anatomy. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one."
1,Best of both worlds? Yeah right!,"This is hardly even close to showing off the best that either Jay Z or R. Kelly can offer with their talents. This CD was rightfully shunned upon it's release and Kelly's legal troubles killed this albums sales but even had that not happened, this album was destined to flop anyway because practically, all of these songs are just plain crud to the get go. Avoid this CD. There's nothing good at all on here."
1,Disappointed...,"...First of all the beats are just booty. Yep you got it right, they [stink]. Big Time. This is unusual because Jay-Z usually doesn't rock over just a straight unlistenable beat; but sad to say that they have maybe two decent beats on the whole album. This is bad.Second of all they have basically one producer team ; Trackmasters...yep the same ones who brought you the excellent Fiesta RMX. But they produce garbage tracks on this album and to make it even worse each track sounds alike...The rapping on the other hand is vintage Jay-Z. Nice rhymes here & there but can get boring at times. R. Kelly's singing is pretty tight throughout as well even though he uses about the same flow on the whole cd. Devin The Dude breathes some life into the album on [P***Y], the only gem on the album....I wouldn't recommend this to even the die hard fans of Jay-Z and R. Kelly. I'm trying to save you money, I am not hating..."
3,I expected more,"R. Kelly and Jay-Z, both at the top of their respected fields in music collaborate to make the Best of Both Worlds. I think my expectations were too high for this. I was expecting to be wowed, but instead I just heard an average album. Jay-Z's vocals are somewhat lacking and R Kelly doesn't seem to be interested. There are some definite gems on this album though, those being ""Get this Money"", ""Take you home with Me"", ""Shorty"", ""Green Light"", and a few others. But the rest of the tracks, along with the gems didn't seem to hold my attention as long as i thought. Maybe they'll both give it another go and make a best of both worlds part 2. While this album is decent enough, there's nothing spectacular.Don't believe Amy Linden and her drubbing of this album. I don't know where they get these writers for these reviews. This album was not a total flop, it just didn't live up to the potential."
2,The Worse of Both Worlds,This album was nothing what I had in mind.There was a lot of bad things in the cd....Also it has to little tracks.The reasons that this cd got two stars was because I respect both of the artist and that I liked Get This Money.Don't waste your money like I did.If you want to get an album get the BLUEPRINT by Jayz.
2,Worst Of Both Worlds,"This CD is not what I expected only notable tracks are ""Take You Home With Me A.K.A Body"" or ""Get This Money"".... Both of these artist haves more potential than This............. Holla."
5,Nas who?,Jay Z and Nas tear it up on this album. Jigga and R Kelly are seriously the best of both worlds. Fantastic album--5 Stars~~
3,Good But Not Good!!!,"This is a good album of production....very good.....but lyrics and some songs jut don't connect. Sometimes Jay and R.Kelly have a good chemistry together.I am a huge Jay-Z fan..I think the guy is awesome.....well besides the fact of Blueprint 2...but that's another story!!!R.Kelly is awesome by himself that song Ignition Remix is off the chain!!! R.Kelly is still goin to make hits even with the recent events.Overall, like I said a good album of production....rhymes and vocals are okay...but the chemistry is way off. I think it's at most worth a listen!!! Peace Folks!!!"
4,"These are two truly great artists,R & J. ...HATERS !.","This album is hot. Is a Party and dance club music all the way (for the exception of track #13). Obviously R.Kelly and Jay-Z are two in a million. BUY IT, NOW!. Its good!."
4,Genius,Jay Z and R Kelly combine on 12 of the hottest tracks this year. The style of Jay Z and R Kelly together make this album HOT. If you like both these artists and R&b and Rap music. Buy this album. You wont stop listening to it. ITS HOT!!!
2,Jay-Z/R. Kelly - The Best of Both Worlds,"This album was doomed from the start. First, R. Kelly's sex scandal prompted Def Jam and Jive (both labels for this album) to cease promotion for this album and take the artists' photos off of the album cover. Second, this album wasn't very good anyway. Neither artist was in the studio with each other while recording, Jay-Z spread himself thin over these tracks, R. Kelly didn't inspire with his half-singing, half-rapping style, and production by the Trackmasters made everything sound like the remix to ""Fiesta"". The only good songs on here were ""P***y"" (with Devin the Dude's verse added at the last minute) and ""Honey"" but R. Kelly's part on these tracks ruined everything. Both artists made this album the worst of all worlds combined. For a better ""Best of Both Worlds"" album, see R&B chanteuse Davina's 1998 album."
4,Talented brothers,"Too bad these two cant work together. Whatever their issues are/were, they could have made a lot of money doing more colabos! Great beats and skills/writing talents. Oh well....I am still enjoying this one and Unfinished business CD."
2,Jay Z is good on this R.Kelly is not,"This is really one of the top 10 Most hyped rap Cds of all time.It was a massive flop because of the R.Kelly scandel.The Best songs on here are Best of Both Worlds-""Body""-It aint Personal-""Streets""-Naked-Somebody's Girl.I heard these two are going to do another album.This album has many lazy beats plus R.Kelly sounds like he does now.Naked that song he comes through and a few others he does to.Put this album down as-awwLyrics-7/10 Production-5/10 X Factor-3/10 Classic-5/10 Replay-4Total=4.5 out of 10 Fingers -Next-"
5,Great Product,"I used this wall mount for my 42"" LG Tv and it worked great. Very easy to install...took about half an hour. I would have another person there to help you mount the TV though because it did get a little awkward trying to put the TV up by myself. Overall a very good product at a very good price."
4,Good Product At A Great Price,"First off, I want to talk about the misleading picture. If you basically remove everything inside the outer frame, that's what the newer version looks like. Having said that, I wouldn't be put off as it's still very strong and can more than cope with today's LCD TVs weighing around 50-60 pounds. Mounting is very easy and comes with a vast assortment of bolts and fixings to meet almost every design out there (providing they stick to Vesa guidelines). Overall, a great product, which does the same job similar mounts offer for at least twice the price, but I do want to dock one star though for the misleading picture and the fact it looked as though the box had already been opened. Reading a previous reviewer, I was wondering if I was getting someone else's castoffs."
2,"It's ""OK""","The good,Includes screws and brackets for a bajillion TV types. Rudimentary installation is fairly easy. Fairly inexpensive.The bad:Poor instructions. Unable to tighten mounting brackets due to their proximity to the wall. Advertised for 50"" displays, but the wall mounted sheet metal is so thin it 'barely' holds my 46"" plasma. Wall screws need to be higher quality steel so the the recessed Phillips receptacle doesn't strip so easily (they are hex screws, so you can use a hex driver when you strip the Phillips).Overall:Once you get it into place, it stays put. So be careful/conservative with the TV weight, and take precautions with the installation, and it should do you well."
4,"Excellent value, but I still had to buy screws","This is an excellent wall mount and a great value. Very sturdy. Why pay more? Just be sure to find the CENTER of your wall studs and you should be fine. The packaging includes many, many screws for a variety of TVs, but the ones provided for my Samsung 46"" LCD were too long (!?). Fortunately, I had read of the issue in someone else's review so I was somewhat informed. I went to a hardware store and got the right, shorter screws - just be sure to avoid the cheaper zinc and find hardened steel screws."
4,Panasonic TH-50PX60U Wall Mount,I received the wall mount promptly and had to call the mfg since my Plasma was not on their list. The most important part of the wall mount is locating and marking the 2 studs to be used. The instructions were adequate but I did need to ask their support person which bolts should be used for my TV since they have quite a few nuts & bolts to accomodate various TVs but they do not tell you which ones to use for your specific TV. I also took advantage of the tilt feature and it took two people to mount the Plasma on the mount. All in all I was very happy about this purchase and would certaintly recommend this for my type of TV. It sure beats paying >$250 for a Panasonic mount.
5,"Easy install, works great!","I used this wall mount to hang a 50 inch Samsung plasma (93 pounds). The wall bracket was very easy to install, and they include the proper hardware for every television imaginable. The brackets were also easy to add to the TV and then you just place it on the wall mount. Because the TV was so large that I was installing, I needed an extension on my cordless screwdriver to tighten the screws on the bottom once hanging on the wall, but that's only related to the size of the TV, just something to keep in mind when you're at the point in the install."
5,works,"i hung off of this thing and did pulls ups on it before putting my 50"" plasma on it. it didn't even flinch. i'm convinced that thousands of years after i'm dead and gone that mount will still be there holding up the tv without any problem. i have no idea why anyone would pay for the more expensive mounts."
4,Well worth the price.,This wallmount is sturdy and very easy to install. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the appearance. It is not as streamlined looking as the mounts costing over twice as much. But since it's hidden by the TV that's a moot point. I didn't have any problems with the supplied hardware. If you drill properly sized pilot holes in the studs and use a little soap to lube the threads the lags work fine. All-in-all a very good buy.
3,Peerless Wall Mount,"Good product, easy to install. I haven't mounted a TV yet but I'm sure it can handle it. One negative: the instructions say you could do a more secure mounting by mounting on 3 studs, but there are no centered holes to fit screws through. I already had the wall opened doing some remodeling, so I was able to get around this by cross-connecting 2x4's between the two 16"" on center studs, and adding a couple more lag bolts for more security."
5,great value,i was very impressed with this product. the craftsmenship and the amount of included hardware made this product very easy to install. plus the fact that its quite a bit cheaper then anything at best buy made this product a must have for my new tv
4,Great Mount,This mount is perfect for my 42 Aquos. Mounting is easy. Directions where clear . This is very well built. Tighting the tilt down might be hard for people with huge hands.
5,Tilting Wall Mount for LCD,"Simple to install. Solid build. Relatively low profile (I don't think you can get around some offset with the cable runs and the necessary tilt). I used this on my Samsung 40"" LCD and am very pleased with the combo as it freed up space on my console and gives a clean look to the wall mount."
4,Good price and very solid.,"The price and free shipping was a plus. I don't think it will take the average person less than 30 minutes like most reviews will have you believing. You can definitely have it done in less than a hour. I did not feel comfortable with the short screws provided for my Samsung lcd, but so far so good."
2,"After installed, my panasonic plasma is dead","1) The product came with missing part. It did not have a little wrench as stated in the picture2) It seemed that the upper hook and bottom cannot snapped on perfectly.3) It provided lot of crews for different type of TV. Only M6 crews fit my plasma. After installed, turned on the TV, my plasma dead and I found out the bottom of my plasma has a little crack. I researched online, people said that because of the TV mount caused the stress on the screen to crack. Now I am hesitance to hang my other new Samsung LCD with this mount. :-("
5,Worked as described,"I have a 46"" Samsung tv that we mounted with this, easily mounted, worked as described."
3,"Easy to use, but check your TV first","I have a LG 47LC7DF 47"" LCD HDTV, and this mount was not big enough. I installed everything, so I know that it was easy to install, and seems sturdy enough, but the Wall bracket is only 31.5"" long. So, measure your screw holes on the back of your TV, and give at least a 1"" margin for brackets. Mine was 33"", so I did not realize until I tried to put the TV up. I hope this helps."
4,Peerless Wall Mount,"Works great for our 32"" LCD TV however since the product is made for a range of sizes, 32"" - 50"" the hardware shows a bit more than I would like behind our 32"" TV. My handy husband put the hardware together and though the directions were not as straighforward and clear as he would have liked, he put it together without too much trouble."
4,Straight forward mounting. Holds the TV up!!!,"The mounting process is fairly straight forward. I had a little bit of trouble getting the mounting screws into the wall using a 18.6V Ryobi drill even after drilling a pilot hole. After several hours, I finally got the screws all the way in and my TV is still on the wall 3 weeks later.Once on the wall, cables are a bit tight to access, but doable if you tile the tv all the way up."
4,Has worked great for us,We bought this set about a year ago. Easy set up. Great picture quality. I bought this one after researching this stuff a lot. Moved into a new house and bought this plasma and two other LCD TVs all from Amazon. As usual they were great.
1,It's not like what you see on here,"I bought this based on many +ve reviews and the product image. But to my bitter surprise when I received today it looks like a photo frame. You can compare this to cheaper $29.99 brands. Peerless saved lots of money by using less steel, but the product cost itself is not reduced. I am returning it!"
1,Not what is shown,"The wall mount may be a good product, but what they sell is not what is shown. This can be misleading advertising, and this is making me more cautious of amazon as time goes on."
1,cant use,"Cant even give a fair review due to lack of receiving a TV to be able to use the product in the first place. It has been sitting in a corner still in the box, so if you really want a review here it is, ""It works GREAT as a door stop""."
4,Check your wall before purchasing...,"The mount is good, but make sure to check your wall/stud location before you order. This unit is designed to mount to 2 studs. One of my studs was in the middle of the wall so the tv would be off-center. I should have purchased a unit that spans 3 studs. I was able to make this one work with a little craftiness.Mount itself is very sturdy and well made. It gets 4 stars rather than 5 because my kit was missing 4 washers and a little screw driver that the instructions said should come with it. I had to make a trip to home depot for the washers."
3,Great for the Price,The nuts and bolts were very well marked and it was very easy to set it up for my television. Their website allows you to check if your TV will work with their mount. I checked on mine and recommend doing so. The bolts can strip easily if you have to make a change like I did -- my own doing. Other than that my TV hangs and looks great on the wall.
4,"Nice Wall Mount, but the instruction gave me an incorrect screw size for my TV","I purchased the wall mount with my brand new Toshiba 47HL167.The instruction on the web recommand using size 6M for screw. But, the TV takes a 8M. Lucky the wall mount came with may types of screws. I would give this wall mount a five stars if they had my TV screw label correctly."
4,good mount,This mount was easy to install. It came with all hardware needed and the directions were good. Great price compared to mounts in stores. If i need another mount I will get another peerless.
4,"Simple, works well","I used this to mount a Samsung LN40A550 to my wall - as high on the wall as could get it. The literature states 15 deg of tilt, but there are two ways of tilting it: (1) is by friction so you can just pull it to the desired location. The second is a series of holes with a screw that you can use to lock it at a particular tilt. So, if you combine the two you can get up to 30 degrees of tilt. The main thing stopping the tilt is that the bottom of the screen will touch the wall (actually, it is usually the cable connections which touch the wall first. In my case, I placed 2x2 blocks between the wall unit and the wall so the back of it sticks an additional 1 1/2 inches away from the wall. This lets me get a bit more tilt on the tv.I would recommend becoming familiar with exactly how the tilt mechanism works before you place this on the wall. Mine was quite stiff and I had to remove it from the wall to verify how it worked before I was confident I was not breaking anything."
