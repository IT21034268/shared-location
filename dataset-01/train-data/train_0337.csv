1,Don't Buy These Sheets!,"I bought these sheets a few months ago and they have already started to pill. They are now very uncomfortable. I was not very satisfied when I first received them because they felt thin and more like a tee shirt than cotton sheets, but now I am very unsatisfied because they have not held up at all."
4,soft enough,"nice set, nice color, it's been served my bed witough any problem. after few times of wash, color did not fade away and still looks nice. good quality product"
3,Not as soft as we were hoping,"The sheets are decent quality but, not nearly as smooth, soft cotton quality as we were hoping or have in other sheet sets."
1,Pillow-cases ripped in first wash,"The sheets slept very hot, so I didn't use them for more than a couple of days. When I went to wash them, one of the pillow-cases ripped."
1,Piling,After 1 month of use these sheets started piling. At 600TC I would have expected these to be much softer. Overall very disappointed. I will not be buying this brand again.
3,OK Not Great,"I am convinced these will be durable, long lasting sheets. However, they lack the softness I expected from a thread count this high."
4,Renaissance 600 thread count sheets,These are very high quality sheets. You can't beat the price! Very comfortable to sleep on.
4,"Very bright, high quality sheets","I bought these sheets thinking they would be a lighter sage green as shown in the pictures, but they're actually a BRIGHT pea green... not horrible, but a little more ""Emerald City"" than I was hoping for. :-)They are quite large... we put the fitted sheet over our deep pillowtop mattress AND a featherbed--- and it's still kinda loose. But the fabric is thick and seems fairly durable. We haven't washed them yet, but I'm kinda hoping they shrink a bit b/c the top of my bed looks a little too ""billowy"" for my preferences..."
3,"Great price, but color loss (?)","I bought these sheets in wheat blue, and they were a super deal... but with just two washings (WITHOUT USING BLEACH), there seem to be an inordinate number of areas where the color seems to be fading/bleaching out.Perhaps these aren't supposed to be laundered like regular sheets (gentle cycle in washer, regular heat cycle), but I do find it odd that the color seems to be falling out in shades.Wondering if anyone else is experiencing this, or am I going mad?If they are indeed prone to bleaching as I am finding out with my set, I'd have to weigh this factor against their thread count and texture (nice and soft, smooth). Hence, the three.:-)"
1,Disapointed,"I've only owned these sheets for two weeks and they are already headed toward the trash. We loved them when we first received them, but now they are starting to show wear and form bumps all over. Very disapointing."
3,Teal looks Gray...,"It's an above average product. Better than Walmart products, but I wasn't too impressed with its feel or quality. The most disappointing aspect of my purchase was its color. I know what ""teal"" color looks like, but this one is closer to gray than teal..."
2,Detaied info not correct,"I doubled checked the product info. and low and behold it's not what it states.The fitted sheet cannot fit a 10"" deep mattress. It said the pockets are 16"" deep,and it doesn't fit very well. We also found that the flat sheet has a flaw in the stitching but it was discovered too late. If you buy this product open the package and check it before use."
1,worthless in less than 3 months,"These sheets were great when they arrived, I was happy with the color, and they were really soft. I rotate between them and another set of sheets each week, so these were actually only used about 6 weeks (6 washings) before the fitted sheet was pilled so bad that it became rough and uncomfortable. The color also became very patchy and spotted after a few washings. I would not buy this brand again, or recommend it to anyone."
2,Actual color did not match image on website,"I ordered the sheets based on the image on the listing which made it look like a light shade of brown. The actual sheets that arrived (the color name was ""Cafe"") were a darker brown with a gold/yellowish hue to them and i was very disappointed. I never opened the package to check the quality of the material...they seemed very nice, i was just disappointed by the color and ended up returning them."
3,"Sheets, good enough","These sheets were as expected, except for the color. We ordered the set listed as Teal. The color received is grey, with no hint of blue as shown in the illustration."
1,Not as it appears.,"The sheets feel nice and are functional. Yay... But they are more golden than mocha. Either they switched it on us and didn't tell us or the company has a very bad photographer working for them. Either way it just isn't worth the effort of shipping them back and going through that hassle, so whatever. Buying things online is always a risk."
2,Queen sheets,"These sheets seemed to be awesome at first use. After sleeping on them, however, there is significant pilling after only a short use. I loved them when I bought them, but now feel otherwise. I would not recommend these sheets."
3,Ok,"These are heavy sheets that seem like they will last awhile, but they are a little stiff, like they need ironed or something. Not as soft as I expected."
3,I guess I'll keep it.,"The sheets are ok, but the color is NOT what you see in the order description. The description says ""Cafe"" and you see tan or ""cafe-ish"" color sheets with a little darker color pillow cases. The set I received were more like ""gold"" or ""mango"". The reason I'm keeping them is because they do match our bedspread and I'm too lazy to go through the hassle of returning them. Next time I'll get them at the store where I can see them.I'm a bit disappointed. I really liked the color in the description."
3,Nice sheets but the color is off,"These are nice and comfortable sheets, but seem a little wrinkled and the color is not what I was expecting. The sheets are more of a gold color than a ""cafe"" color. We still use them since they are covered by our comforter."
3,\teal is not grey! \,"The color was a big disappointment, but the quality of the material for the cost was a great value."
3,Sheets were ok,"Sheets are nice, thick... I washed them and somehow the entire set came out with stains on them and I have no idea what from. So I was irritated with that...don't know if it was something in the washer/dryer, but sheets are good."
2,packaging,"did not come in original package, but seemed to be opened and not by us. The sheets still do not fit the bed."
5,nice quality,"My wife and I are very pleased with the Renaissance 600 thread count Sateen King Set. The sheets are very comfortable and after washing they seem to be durable. We are happy with both the Ivory and the Cafe sets. They are heavier than I thought they would be but, are still soft and comfortable."
1,Color is NOT ivory,I recently received these sheets and as soon as I opened the box I could tell that the sheets weren't the color in the description or in the picture on Amazon. I ordered the ivory queen-size sheet set and what I received (though it says ivory on the package) is more like beige or tan. My understanding has always been that ivory is off-white but this is at least 2-3 shades darker than that. I'll be sending these back.
5,Renaissance 600 sheet set,BEAUTIFUL! DURABLE! COMFORTABLE!!It was a reat price as well!Will order more for the other beds in my home.GREAT PRODUCT!
3,Everyday type of sheet,"THe sheet is OK- not excellent, just ok- what really annoyed me is that it came dirty and even when I washed it, the stain remained- would not recommend it if you are looking for soomething special- be ready to have a super powerful iron as it requires plenty of ironing after washing"
1,Scratchy sheets,These sheets are awful. They are very scratchy and not comfortable at all. Disappointing since I've bought Renaissance sheets in the past and been happy with them. I will not be buying these again.
1,"Not Soft, Cheap Feeling, And Received Sheets with Large Hole in the Middle Of Sheets","The title says it all in a concise manner. Sateen sheets are intended to be soft to the touch and are very dissimilar to the sateen sheets my friend purchased in a bedding store. After feeling the coarse rough-feeling nature I quickly noticed a large 3cm x 3cm (large) hole in the middle of the main bedding sheet through it's folded portion - meaning numerous large holes in different areas.Although there are many products I purchase on Amazon that are worth their price, these are no more impressive than most of the 400-thread cotton sheets I considered purchasing in the store. Perhaps, these sheets are vastly more comfortable to the touch after washing, but they certainly are not a bargain for the quality upon initial opinion.I hope your purchase experience was/is better."
2,Not very soft!,"I was really hoping for some soft sheets. These aren't very soft. I washed them 10 times trying to get them soft enough to sleep on. They are a tad better, but not near as soft as I would like. Hopefully they will get softer with time, because I already threw away the packaging or I would have returned them."
4,Surprisingly high quality!,"I have to admit that for 40 bucks on sale I wasn't expecting much. My bed is extra, extra deep and has been impossible to find sheets for, so I took a chance. The quality seems to be very high, the color is perfect for what I needed and the pockets are deep enough for the bed. I would definitely buy more of these."
1,"welcome to the future, where your bed becomes not only a place to sleep, but also exfoliates your skin.","these sheets are terrible, you might as well buy the $20 ikea sheets. 100% cotton?, sure maybe, sateen weave? definitely not....save your money cause this isn't a steal"
1,CHEAP QUALITY,"...AFTER A FEW WASH, IT LOOKS LIKE A 100 YEAR OLD GRANDMOTHER! !THE QUALITY IS SO BAD ...SO .. SO CHEAP, IT DOSENT FIT MY KING SIZE BED, I USE VERY LOW HEAT ..STILL"
1,"Not ""sateen"" but heavy and like sandpaper.","I'm disappointed in the sheet set. Yes, they are well made and fit my King nicely. However, to me, ""Sateen"" means soft and silky sheets, especially with a 600 thread count. The set is not soft on the skin and feels more like sandpaper. I am going to try washing & drying them a dozen times to get to the ""sateen"" stage."
2,Scratchy,Got these and when I opened I thought they were a bit rough. Washed and then washed again. I feel like I am back to my college days when I wasn't concerned about thread count and got the cute sheets. Swear these feel like a 200 thread count sheet. I like the color and hope they soften more with washings.
4,Not too shabby,"-the color was as described and had a nice, subtle sheen to it-the fabric seemed a little on the thin side which makes me concerned that it will start ""pilling"" after 4-5 washes"
3,"Not bad, not great","I've had these sheets for about a month now and they have started pearling in some spots. They're also not quite soft. Not great, not bad. You get what you pay for."
3,Not soft,These sheet feel more like 200 thread count. They are stiff and they make a lot of rustling noises when shifting around in the bed--not bad except when they are right next to your ear.
1,What happened to the sound? (Updated),"Like the other reviewers, I love Ormandy's performance and would give it five stars, were it not compromised by the remastered sound, which has an artificial sounding ""reverb"" I don't recall hearing in past releases. It sabotages this release, and I wouldn't buy it for that reason. Too bad since the original Philadelphia sound was magnificent.Updated 22 December 2011: Since I reviewed that C, I l've listened to the same (presumably) recording on another, 2009 CD release on Sony Classics to compare. I've gone back and forth several times and I'll swear I hear a distinctly better sound on the newer release, compared to this one. Instruments sound more forward and clearer and the former reverb is gone, or is much less. FOR THAT VERSION (Sony B0000027BD) I ENTHUSIASTICALLY GIVE 5 STARS! I'm so happy I can now recommend this version to all my friends! (-:"
4,No chorus,"This is an excellent recording with only one exception: there is no choral accompaniment in the Waltz of the Snoflakes. This reallly annoyed me, as this is an excerpt that is usually omitted in highlighted recordings. Otherwise, great classic recording."
4,Good Book but not as discribed,"The book itself is great however it was described as in good condition however I would have said it was in ok condition. The cover was dog eared, spine was cracked so would have to say not as described."
2,disappointed...,"If you were a fan of Umphrey's McGee on Anchor Drops, then don't buy this CD! I was thoroughly disappointed. UM has substituted their unbelievable songwriting and musicianship skills for writing, compared to Anchor Drops, bland pop songs. Granted, compared to the rest of the pop and pop/rock out today, it is great, but compared to their old material, it is very watered down. There are a couple of good songs, and each musician throws out a few impressive licks, but, overall, I was very disappointed and hope that Umphrey's decides to go back to what they do best...making good music!"
5,5 stars is no joke,"I bought this album knowing little about Umphrey's, a couple friends mentioned them to me but I have yet to see them live (this will change). I heard a clip of 'Women, Wine and Song' and said I had to have this song on CD. After getting it, it turns out that as good as that song is it is probably my 6th or 7th favorite on this album. The songs seem to grow on you the more you listen to them as well, far superior in the studio as far as lyrics and musicianship to their other jam band brothers. All of the 5 star reviews are not just fanatics trying to hype their band this album is for real. Highlights include Liquid, Nemo, Passing, Intentions Clear, Rocker, Words, WW&S. In other words the whole album is great. Highly recommended for anyone desperately looking for good music in this day and age."
3,Safe enough,"McGee's strained studio technicalities started feeling more cohesive here, compensating what would usually be overwritten quirkiness with more sensitive sophistications and selfless simplicities, if still not able to truly combine these opposing forces convincingly."
3,Some Good Some Not,"Do 3 or 4 really good songs make a good album, not this time. I don't know if the other songs were weak or they all needed more of the same style from song to song. The Bottom Half(their newest)is much stronger."
5,This is the best cd in the world,"I love this CD! i listen to it over and over and over! even tho it's really different than what me or my friends normally listen to, i really enjoyed it. i want to play guitar just like anthony."
1,"""gradual"" wake-up is anything but","This seems like a serviceable unit in other respects, but the gradual wake-up feature starts at a loud level and becomes excruciating (at least for me). The reason I purchased this clock was so that I could have an alarm go off without waking my wife. That's just not possible with this unit. Otherwise seemed OK, but not useful for me so I returned it."
1,Problem with Auto-dimmer,"Although I like this clock, there is a defect with auto-dimming feature, which gradually causes it to dim completely at night. I've returned and bought 3 different times and they all have this problem. Also, if alarm sounds and no one is home, it will continue to beep forever.I do like the big buttons and the big display."
1,Horrible reception,"I bought this clock radio for the large display (nice) and supposedly good reception. The reception is awful, and I cannot tune into two of my favorite stations, which my husband is able to get on his bedside radio. I have tried everything: moving the radio, placing it on a stack of books, gentley moving the tuner. Nothing works. I do not recommend this radio."
2,This alarm made me late for work today,"The reason I'm looking at alarm clocks today is because this one let me down. I've had it for 4 years, and it stopped working today. I set my alarm, and it just didn't go off. I checked, rechecked - no, it's not set to PM instead of AM - it's a faulty clock. Very strange.The 'forward' time set button stopped working two weeks ago - now it can only be set in reverse. ""Not a big deal,"" I thought, ""as long as the alarm still works.""I've grown to assume that consumer electronics have a finite lifespan, so this was really no surprise. Then I mentioned it to a co-worker, and he said he's had the same alarm clock since 1988. My parents have had the same alarm clock since 1981.Anyway, if you want to buy an alarm clock every 4 years, this should be your top choice. If not, look elsewhere."
2,Don't buy this clock,"Another dissatisfied customer. The auto-dimmer fades out completely at night and the regular display is so bright that it wakes me up at night. Also while the gradual volume increase on the alarm feature technically works, it starts off pretty load to begin with, jarring me out of sleep. Looks like I need to find a new alarm clock..."
1,stinks,"The dimmer problem identified by other reviewer is a real problem, but the REAL problem is the arrangement of buttons on the top of the clock ... the OFF button is just to the left of the SNOOZE bar and both are pushbuttons (different sizes, but same type of mechanism), meaning it is far to easy too actually shut the alarm off rather than getting a 9 minute reprieve. This is a horrible design - and the designer ought to be fired. I've actually been assigned the task (by the wife) to go get a new clock."
4,"A Unique Perspective, Generally Interesting","This book is a collection of short essays on Brazil. I found at least half to be quite interesting, though I probably skimmed about a quarter of them. Many of the essays frequently give a first hand account of life as a small farmer, favela resident or fisherman in Brazil. These essays capture and explain to the English reader the hopes, values and experiences of actual Brazilians. Most English readers gain their understanding of Brazil only second hand through academics or journalists. This book offers a fresh, reality based perspective on Brazil for English readers who haven't learned about Brazil outside of academia, the New York Times, or the beaches of Rio."
2,"A basic, informative guide","Color photos and discriptions of a broad range of birds and covers basic bird health, training, care, breeding and housing. Helpful for choosing a bird, but not a complete resource."
3,Good but not good enough,I liked this book because it had a lot of info but and neat bird breeds. But when I was looking for some info on a VERY common bird it wasn't there. If you just want the general info this is great but not if your'e looking for what kind of bird is right for you. And some of the info is out of date. it says you should use grit and you SHOULD NOT USE GRIT WITH YOU BIRDS!
3,Good Movie,"I saw the movie on DVD that day and i checked out the release date here it says 2001, i was shocked Cos Sunny looks straight out of his ZIDDI days(1997) and Chunky and Naseer look younger Then i read the trivia which says the film had started in 1995 and had to have Sunny in a guest role which was extended and the film was sold as Sunny's film which led to a fight and the delay which showsThe movie is trite which was sold as Sunny's films post GHAYAL It has a mega loud and annoying Chunky Pandey who wears purple suits and orange pants It has Naseeruddin Shah doing nonsense and getting old in scenes(is it just me who noticed his white hair in some scenes) Sunny Deol is his usual self Neelam makes an appearance after HSSH where she was a side actress here she pairs with Sunny after the tripe VISHNU DEVAA(1992)"
5,Play does not date at all.,"a great play by a wonderful playwright; see also both film versions, the one with David Niven and the one with Alan Bates"
2,A disappointment,"I bought this book for my 18-month old. The illustrations and colors are not too engaging to me, and my daughter is actually scared of the book! Perhaps the story is too packed with sound effects to be read aloud. It actually sounds a bit annoying. The book is now tucked away in a closet somewhere."
5,So Can You!,"Mr. Brown Can Moo!Can You?Dr. SeussThis is a book of sounds. It helps beginning readers learn to sound out words. When I was working on words with my oldest daughter, I soon found the my second daughter was also reading the words.Before you know it the children have learned all the sounds along with Mr. Brown.I highly recommend this book for young readers.Jill Ammon Vanderwood, authorThrough the RugThrough The Rug: Follow That Dog (Through the Rug)"
5,A Wonderful Book for Babies,My 8 mo old daughter LOVES this book. I have never seen her react to any of her books like she does to this one. She laughs and giggles the entire time as the noises are wonderful and the pictures are great too. I am sure we will read this book over and over again!
3,Okay as a baby book,"This little board book, like the others in the Dr. Seuss collection, is abbreviated, but it's fine for young babies. For toddlers and older, though, the full-length, non-cardboard versions are much more interesting."
5,First book to make my son laugh,"This book is so much fun. My son laughed for the first time at the funny sounds Mr. Brown can do - in particular he thought the Buzz Buzz was pretty funny - each time, another sound catches his interest. I love to read it to him to hear his cute chuckles - he is only 5 months!"
5,Weird Noises Mr. Brown Can Do,"Mr. Brown Can Moo! Can You? is a great book. It's funny because Mr. Brown makes a lot of funny noises such as ""a cow, bee, horse, roster, owl, whisper like a butterfly, a cat slurping, hippo, and a goldfish kiss."" Mr. Brown can also make other noises. He can make the sound of a ""cork pop, squeaky shoes, rain, train, horn, clock, door knock, egg sizzling, thunder, and lightning. Everybody will like this book because it has great noises."
3,Mr. Brown Can Moo ! Can You!,The book Mr. Brown Can Moo Can You is a good book if you wana learn. Its about Mr. Brown wanting you to make funny noises and repeating them. This books lesson is the take your time and listen to everything around you. I think the age level is for kids about 3-5. The book was ok its wasnt the greatest little kids book but it was fun to read to little kids.They enjoy it.
5,Wonderful,My 17 month old loves this book! Her grandfather even taught her to make the popping noise like Mr. Brown. It is so precious. A must have in your little ones library.
5,Great book for infants,I started to read this book to my twin boys at about the age of 6 months. Out of all the books I read to them (which is a lot) this is their absolute favorite. It gets their attention and keeps it throughout the whole book which is very hard at this age. They are 9 1/2 months now and I still have not found another book that they like as much as this one!
5,"Mother of 2, this has passed down the generations","This was my favorite book as a small child, it was my son's favorite book when he was a toddler (he's now 11), and now my daughter is 19 months-and, yep, she adores it! She has entered the 'mimicking' phase, so she loves hearing me make all those sounds, and then she copies Mom, er, 'Mr. Brown', and we giggle through every page. This book has made a bigger impression than 'Pat the Bunny' or 'Goodnight Moon' in our house!"
5,"Great book! can be either funny or relaxing,","This was my son's first book in English, and at 11 months, after 5 months of listening to it, he still can't have enough of it. Lately he started making some of the sounds (the rooster's cock-a-doodle-DOOO! and the owl's hoo hoo hoo hoo are his favorites), so I figured he also learned something in the process.love it. go buy it now."
5,A favorite in our house!,"My son got this book from grandma when he was a little over a year old. It was an automatic favorite! It starts with ""Oh the wonderful sounds Mr. Brown can do. He can sound like a cow. He can go moo moo."" It has pictures that are engaging for their simplicity and a rhyme that is flowing but varied so it doen't get boring. My son loved learning the noises and now he says them along with me when I read. I've even caught him looking at this book and saying the noises to himself. He's now 2 and we still read this one often (and I have it memorized). I highly recommend this book. I just don't know how you couldn't like it!"
2,"Fun reading, but not very sturdy","I have bought several of the Dr. Suess Bright and Early Board Books, and they simply don't stand up to the abuse a toddler dishes out. None of the other board books we own have fallen apart the way these have."
3,3 star because it was the book I needed and it came fast.,The book was not clean and the spine was damaged. Rice was up in the spine so when I held it open to read to the kids it all fell out on the floor. It appeared that the pages were torn from the spine than glue together because they didn't open properly. I needed the book for my lessons or it would have went back.
3,not visually engaging,I read this to my 1 yr old daughter.The sounds are fun and she enjoys them. She generally gets hooked to all other colorful books I read to her but not this one. The cartoon in the book is not exactly what you would expect to find in a book for toddlers. Its rather what you would find in a comic but what else could you expect for the price.I read the book and she keeps looking at me. Its nice to have that kind of attention from a 1 yr old but now I just make those noises and dont need the book anymore.
4,Classic book,"I had this book when I was a child so I when I was looking for book for my 10mth old son, I thought of this book first. It's colourfull, fun & very sturdy."
5,Great book for babies...,"I started reading this book to my daughter at 2 months. She loves the funny sounds I make while reading. Now that she is 3 months old, she can appreciate the colorful illustrations. This book is just the right length to hold a baby's attention. Also, this book is small, ideal for packing and to take on trips."
2,A Terrible Version,"Be warned! These ""Board Books"" are not the same as the original versions of the Dr. Seuss classics, but are instead slightly changed versions of the same stories. The normal Dr. Seuss books flow extremely well, provide interesting stories, and have beautiful cadence. These ""Board Books"" illustrate very effectively why there was only one Dr. Seuss -- basically, the modifications that have been made to the stories make them much less compelling and educational. In particular, the rhyming is never as good, and the meter is non-existent. I will grant that the ""Board Book"" style is much more durable, as our child has torn a number of the classic Mr. Brown pages. That having been said, I would still encourage you to buy the classic version of Mr. Brown instead of this one; its ISBN number is 0394806220."
4,"Great book, but the full version is better...","My toddler LOVES this book...she always says ""where Mr Brown go?"". However, this board book is a shorter version than the full book. For younger kids that's good for their attention span, but there are a lot more rhymes in the full book."
3,It's ok.,"It's ok, but nothing great. My child enjoys more the pictures than rhymes. The thing that I really like about this book is the format: convenient for babies and toddlers to hold in their hands."
5,Great First Dr Suess book!,Very entertaining and short Dr Suess book. My 3 year old loves it. She can't sit still for the longer books.
2,New book with Marker on the front!!?!?,"First let me start by saying I love this story, I specifically went out of my way to find it for my son. The story its self deserves a 5 star rating but how in the world did I end up with a new never opened book with Marker on the front of it. Its green and I am very upset with this. I will update my review if this is rectified but right now I am NOT HAPPY."
5,Wonderful Book,I purchased this book for my granddaughter who is 2 years old. It is a fun book to read and she loves it.
1,I expected much better sound.,"I expected much better sound, even for the price. I bought a Philips Boom Box for my other son for less. That one sound sooooo much better! This RCA sounds like it's coming thru a tin can. Extremely disappointed!"
3,RCA a disappointment.,"I purchased this product because I wanted a 3-in-1 player for the kitchen. CD's sound great; the radio is just OK; but the corker was the sound for the tapes. Ugh! They are so muffled with this machine that you can't understand any words. There is no tone adjustment. Forget the talking books! Did I get a lemon? I sure wish I could find out who to talk to! I could have paid less with a different brand. I thought it was ""safe"" to buy RCA before actually hearing it. Buyer beware!"
2,Purchased only because there's nothing better,"I've read the reviews for a few different bathtub crayons and really would have liked to bought the endangered species crayons which are one entire crayon and triangular and easy to hang on to. However, in multiple reviews for that product it was stated that those fall part after the first bath. So, I opted for these instead. And they are useful for multiple baths but it should be known that they break easily and the crayon, which is only about 1/4 the size of an actual crayon, falls out of the cheap plastic holder."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!,"Idea is great...writes/draws well...but is ABSURDLY hard to clean!!! It just smears and smears...its like trying to clean wax with water....doesn't work! It will come off after you SCRUB, and I mean SCRUB the tub. But come on....that is ridiculous. Very disappointed. I'm sticking with the markers."
1,Not worth it,"The crayon is in a plastic tube, which makes it seem more durable, but my 20-month old son quickly figured out how to raise and lower the crayon, then would try to write on the tub and the crayon would immediately break. He'd raise it higher and it'd break again. They lasted through 2 baths. The crayon is way too soft and it's too easy to raise and lower the crayon."
4,Great bathtub crayons!,"I got these to keep my son entertained in the tub--and he loves them! he also loves to line them up on the edge of the tub and make a ""choo-choo train,"" so they double as another toy for him. He loves to draw, and color in the tub. It also helps him work on his colors, and I'll draw shapes and letters, so sometimes it's a preschool lesson, too.Double the fun--I have a couple crayons in the shower--my husband and I have running games of hangman going, too.It cleans up easy--aside from the hangman, we wipe everything off with a washcloth as soon as bathtime is over.We just bought our second set--our first set lasted for at least four months."
2,Disappointed,"There is very little crayon to these. They are mostly plastic holder (which is useless once the crayon is gone though I suppose you could use them for real crayons since they are the same size)! They also disintegrate too easily in water and fall out of the plastic holders quite easily as well as get pushed back. Some of the colors work better than others but overall they give good color.When my little brother was a kid, we had Crayola bath crayons and they were big fat ones with no plastic holder. I didn't realize upon buying these that they would be the way they are. I expected more from Crayola than this! Very disappointed in this product!!!!"
3,Somewhat fragile,"I really like this type of product. Drawing pictures, letters, and numbers at bath time is fun and educational. I think the TaDoodles bathtub crayons have better primary colors and they have grips which are easier for 2-year-olds to hold. These crayons instead have more of a pastel selection which is not as bold on the tiles of our bath tub wall. Also, the tip of the first crayon I tried broke under almost no pressure at all. I took much greater care with subsequent crayons."
4,They Work Very Well!,"Great bath crayons! Work well, last long & great colors! Oh, and Super Amazon Seller!"
3,Difficult To Clean Up,"My son loved drawing with the crayons in the bathtub, however, the marks are very difficult to clean off the tub afterwards. You have to scrub them off immediatly because if you let it set for any length of time, the marks may never come off."
1,PRICE GOUGING!,"This sells for $6 on crayolastore dot comIt is disgusting how Amazon allows merchants to overprice children's toys on their site!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The current Amazon merchant price of over $20 then PLUS SHIPPING COSTS, is absolutely ridiculous."
2,Difficult to remove from the tub,"I had a hard time removing this from the tub and had to use a Magic Eraser sponge and then Soft Scrub with bleach. Our tub is about 15 years old but I didn't expect that to be considered an 'older tub' like the warning says. I don't want to worry about bath crayons staining the tub or anything else (like clothes or towels). Also, if the crayon sits in the water (like while your child is using another crayon) it will disintegrate a bit.I would prefer bath crayons that are made from soap."
2,Just not sturdy enough,"We got these crayons to replace the Alex brand that our little guy liked. We thought we would try Crayola because the Alex brand fell apart before they were used up. Unfortunately, the Crayola are worse for this. They are thinner and crumble easier with less pressure. The casing is an issue as well because the ends have a square hole at the bottom that our son would shove the top of another crayon in, thus trapping the tip and grinding it into crumbs. The Alex brand do not have this design flaw either."
4,Great bathtime fun!,"My son loves these crayons. He writes on the tiles and the tub. They seem to hold up well, even when left in water. The downside is if you wait to clean them off, they do stain. They are harder to get out of grout than I anticipated but it just takes some bleach, a stiff brush and elbow grease. Very pleased!"
2,Gooey,"We have tried 2 different versions of crayola bathtub crayons, and while this one lasts longer on the tub, IT LASTS LONGER ON THE TUB. We had to scrub to get it off, and even resorted to a magic eraser to get it off. The 'cheaper' version washes off with water and hand rubbing."
1,Would not buy again,"We're usually pretty happy with Crayola products, but don't waste your money on these crayons. On first use, several of the crayons fell out of their plastic holders. The crayons are also super-soft and if they're under water too long, they basically disintegrate and crumble (wouldn't be a problem, maybe, if they didn't keep falling out of their holders!). Clean up has not been an issue as I've not had the problem with them staining my tub that others have reported."
2,Seriously I'm reviewing crayons!,"I came to Amazon to look to replace my current tub crayons; these ones. They are a smaller skinny crayon inside of a round plastic holder. I don't like that they fall out of the holders easily and the wax part itself is too easily forced back into the outer tube and this obviously frustrates my kids. The part that frustrates me the most is that the inside wax part is so thin that it easily goes down my tub drain and gets stuck. I just completed a surgical procedure on the drain to get it to flow again. Other than that, they clean off well enough."
3,Great idea...but...,"Love the concept ofthis toy, drawing in the tub is awesome! However we've been using these for a while now and they break off easily. Sometimes the little clicker thing to push the crayon up sticks too. Also, can someone explain to me the reason behind a white crayon? you an't do anythgin with it, especially since most ubs are white. it is a waste to include it in there.Otherwise this is a good toy, I will buy again becase my son likes it, but just uinderstand that it is not a perfect toy."
2,Not what i expected,I was super excited to get these bath crayons for my daughter. She loves to color and she loves to bath. It was the perfect combination. She LOVED them. Entertained her so much! BUT i hate them. They are washable and wash right out but they leave the water dark. When I drained her bathtub the first time there was a black line where the water level was. It wouldn't just wash off. I had to get my AJAX bleach and scrub the crap out of it to get rid of the black line. Everytime she uses them it's a process to get the tub white again. Other then that she loves them and they last okay. I wouldn't recommend them unless you really REALLY love to clean.
3,Great for kids not so great for parents,My child loved playing with these crayons in the bath. She would spend a lot more time in the bath and be much happier. The only drawback is that you spend a lot more time cleaning the drawings off the walls and floors.
5,ich schreibe gern mit diesen Markers,"tons of fun. my nephew loves these things it helps get him into the tub at night and i like drawing with them too,our upstairs bathroom is usually colored up"
1,WILL NOT WASH OFF PORCELAIN!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!,"My 5 year old loves to draw, so we were so excited to get these bathtub crayons. The first night he used them, he drew on the tiles on the wall around the bathtub. After his bath I went to remove the crayon from the tiles, and it was not easy, it took a lot of elbow grease. Tonight, he drew under the water on the porcelain tub itself, AND IT WILL NOT COME OFF. First I tried spraying Clorox Green Works and rubbing it with a rag. That had no effect, so I tried spraying it with Krud Kutter and scrubbing it with a large scouring tool. IT STILL WON""T COME OFF!!!!! In the morning I'm going to have to contact Crayola and see if they can think of something to get this off our bathtub. But these ""bathtub"" crayons are going in the trash and I will never buy them again!"
3,beware,I think these were meant to be used on tile tub/showers. My fiberglass walls are now stained. Cannot remove color.
2,Too Hard to Clean Up,"My grandson loves these crayons, but I won't buy them again. They are really hard to clean off the tub. I needed to use cleanser to get the crayon off. Get the tub markers instead - they just rinse off when you are done."
3,Don't leave on for very long,"Cool idea, I use them to write down ideas that come to me in the shower (Hey don't judge). They cannot be left in the shower, as they begin deteriorating (melting), I guess I like hot showers. Don't leave the crayon on the shower walls for very long (over a day), it takes some scrubbing to get all the color off."
1,Not a serious work - a terrible mess,"Really rather a shame. Might have been quite an interesting work if it hadn't taken the by now utterly tired ""it's an elitist institution of my god I hate it"" track. Everyone knows that modernism is polemical and complex. This makes it extraordinarily interesting and exciting, but like every other form of modernism, its complexity opens it up to the rage of the slaves who scream the empty phrase ""elitist"" while failing to evaluate judicially the object under consideration (here a state funded institute for new music and musical research). One can only consider this work: a failure."
1,This is a worthless album.,"I am an Alice connoisseur, I've heard all his recordings, even his early '80's imports. A Fistful of Alice is worse than the imports, I can handle them. This is for the non-Alice fans that think he put out his best music in the late '80's. If one wishes to hear the real Alice live, I suggest they buy The Alice Cooper Show 1971. If one wishes to hear ""heavy metal Alice"" with other ""stars"" from the eighties, I suppose this would be the album. I gave it one star because that is as low as they let me go. I give it Zero stars."
4,Great live Alice,"This album is just plain fun. Whether you're a devoted fan of Alice Cooper or just a casual one, you should enjoy these fine live versions of some of his best songs.True, ""Fistful Of Alice"" is too short, missing out on such classics as ""Under My Wheels"" and ""No More Mr Nice Guy"", but it's also very reasonably priced, and it's hard to fault what is here: Tight, focused live renditions of ""School's Out"", ""I'm Eighteen"", ""Elected"", ""Poison"", ""Lost In America"" and many more. The sound is very good, and unlike some hard rock albums, the band is gritty but restrained and they don't resort to long, pointless and eventually tedious instrumental breaks or wild solos.Alice Cooper's vocals are raw and powerful, and he has never sounded better. This is great stuff."
4,A Great live recording,"What a great live recording. I went to an Alice Cooper concert here in Rio a few years ago (probably 1996) an I was impressed by the energy he puts in it. It was a lot better than the Megadeth concert the same day. That energy is all in this live recording, even in the slow tracks."
4,One of the best live CDs you can buy.,"With the exception of Rob Zombie's painful rendition of Feed My Frankenstein, every song is beautifully performed. Alice's vocals are flawless, and he sings the songs just like he did in the studio versions (unlike most artists, who sing the harder parts of a song an octave lower, or something like that). New life is brought into some of his older songs which, due to the technology, sounded somewhat thin when first recorded."
4,A Great Live Effort,"There are some reviews on here that aren't so flattering regarding this great album. Well, let me be the first to tell you they must be listening to the wrong album. I can only agree that it should have been two discs because he has so much material and that he should've had more new songs instead of the old stanbys, but to say it is without energy and give it a substandard rating is way off. At least he threw in a few songs he rarely does live (""Clones"", and ""Teenage Lament""). The club atmosphere is perfect and the performace is energetic and in your face. It is better that The Alice Cooper Show by far. It is like two different artists. For a good rockin' time you should buy this import version. The US release is a good time too, but a shorter show."
4,Helpful little book,"This book is helpful and to the point. It is a good reference when you are stuck with starting your paper, and really helps with the bibliography. I didn't know how my professor wanted the title page, so I looked at what they recommended in this book and that's what I did. I also didn't know how to add e-mails, websites, etc... to a bibliography, or should I say ""Works Cited""."
2,"Useful, for hard to read and understand","This book was part of our mandatory purchases for the school year. While I can see why it would be very useful to some, it is very hard to read and understand, even for an Honors English students such as myself. I find myself getting frustrated when reading the word of the book, many because it shows very advanced, college level work that I always think I must copy (the style). While this book was meant to help my classmates and I with research papers, it only makes it more confusing and harder to learn Modern Language Association style."
3,Pretty But Somewhat Superficial,"This is a very pretty book and very well photographed. The choice of houses, however, left something to be desired and the writeups on the houses themselves were thin and more akin to a puffy decorator magazine than any kind of detailed study. The book also had utterly no floorplan sketches for any of the homes, which is really almost mandatory for an architecture book. Some of the houses selected were not of any particular merit nor were they even old. Most of the write-ups on the various houses had almost nothing to say about the architectural detail and history nor any kind of regional or sub-regional analysis. Some photos were selected obviously because they were ""pretty"" but had utterly nothing to do with Pennsylvania -- the New England chest on the back cover is a good example. It's a nice book to flip through but don't expect great depth."
2,Stone Houses and It's Inaccuracies,"While beautifully photographed it excludes many fine Bucks County homes and is rife with errors in the description of some of the areas in the Thompson - Neely House as well as misidentified antiques in other houses. As a historic guide at the Thompson-Neely House for 25 years as well as having lived there at various times, I know that the first addition consisted of two rooms on each floor not one as stated and in one photo a beautiful fireplace has been relocated to the second floor from the first.This is a fine decorative coffee table book but should never be used for any type of reference."
1,inadequate,"I found it nice but inadequate, since actually useful information was small part of the lot, from an architectural point of view."
1,Not the answer I was looking for.,"If you like dirty dishes, then this detergent is for you. I truly am not exaggerating when I say that my dishes came out dirtier than when they went in. This leaves a yucky film on all the dishes. No actual food removing occurred with the use of this product. I tried and tried for two weeks - now I've given up and purchased Cascade Complete. My dishes sparkle again, and more important, they are CLEAN. I have tried all of the ""natural"" detergents I can find. Until one actually works, I'll have to stay with the tried and true."
3,Provocative,"While I found a few of her assumptions giant leaps of faith, and the examination of Nietzsche's writings overly-long, this was a very provocative and informative book that made me question many ""truths"" society takes for granted.I am now reading two more of her books which I hope fill in some gaps and flesh out more of her theories."
5,Very valuable reading,"This book, along with Drama of the Gifted Child, is one of Miller's best. It provides tremendous insights into the family lives and traumas of Nietzsche, Hitler, Stalin and others. Her insights into the hidden or unrecognized abuses that go on in families are tremendous--but not everyone can accept what she writes, because it requires some painful recognitions about our own family lives."
5,18 Holiday Songs for the Little Ones,Released in 2006 for the holidays this is a new set of songs in the Baby Einstein series. 18 well loved classics.
4,The Wife Likes It,"I picked this up after seeing Susan in ""The Roswell Movie"" and in total, it's a well-executed singer/ songwriter acoustic thing with a little fiddle and percussion. No surprises there. Relaxing to listen to, sometimes more singing than actual songs, if you get my meaning. Standouts are ""The Roswell Incident"" narrative and ""Great Day."""
3,A lot of extra words...,"This book has a lot of unneeded words, and it kind of clutters my mind. I know the book can't change, but that's just my opinion about it. The Scarlet Letter has an interesting plot line, but it starts out slow. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a romantic adventure and a challenging text."
5,Loved it,I read this book in high school and loved it. I don't know why but I did. I always read ahead of the class.
4,Old Classic,Fun to read again to see how I feel about it now. Read this for the first time many many years ago.
2,Stop! Read Lindbeck!,"Vanhoozer tries to appropriate George Lindbeck's cultural-linguistic approach for biblicists via what he calls a ""canonical-linguistic"" approach. Basically, he claims the Bible has a logic of usage and thus a system of habituating consistent meanings internal to itself, before it is socialized into ecclesial life. Historically this is highly problematic, given that the Bible's content and orthodox meaning were determined by the Church over several centuries (50AD-400ish, if not later). If you don't believe that last sentence then you will probably love Vanhoozer's book. If you're looking for something a bit more intellectually satisfying then you should probably skip Vanhoozer's qualifications of Lindbeck and go read Lindbeck's ""The Nature of Doctrine"" yourself. On the plus side, Vanhoozer displays more or less sophisticated dealings with many post-modern theorists that do not get dealt with by many of Vanhoozer's colleagues, and that should be applauded."
3,Great Movie! Bad Transfer to DVD!,"Again, Warner Brothers has butchered a great movie by giving us a Standard Version format, modified to fit our TV screen, rather than providing the original Widescreen theatrical format! Would someone please tell me why they do this? Warner Bros previously botched the transfer to DVD of another great movie, ""Chariots of Fire,"" by doing the same thing. Whoever is making these decisions at Warner's needs to understand that we (I believe most of us) want the original picture when we buy a DVD, not a Pan-and-Scan or Standardized Version. The least they could do is provide Widescreen on one side and Standard on the other -- what countless studios have done already. I still give it 3 stars....even THEY couldn't destroy this great movie entirely."
2,BEWARE! THIS DVD ISN'T WIDESCREEN!,"Dear Film Company Jackasses,Surely you know we already hate you for your greed - Why do you add insult to injury by taking fine films like ""The Great Santini"" and cutting them to Full Screen?Yet another fine film marred, no doubt, by some big company's desire to cut corners. Burn, Hollywood, burn!"
4,Still a good movie,"This is still a really good movie, even after more than 20 years. Remove the uniforms, and the plot could speak to a number of families. Still don't understand why the box shows an F-4 with Navy markings instead of Marine."
1,Don't Buy It Til It Comes Out in the Widscreen Format,The reviews that said: Good Film Bad Transfer are Right. Don't buy it until they do it right. I don't know why studios insist on doing this. I think it saves them money because they can use the old VCR transfers directly on the DVD. They make enough money on old stock to do it right.
4,"Strong story, strong acting",A very true-to-life depiction of a military family struggling to live a normal life under the heavy influence of a militeristic father. Robert Duval gives a dynamite performance and Blythe Danner of the long-suffering wife.
1,Would have been great if in English,"All in Japanesse, so I had to return it and can not locate another one. it was a Christmas gift."
4,Duvall is Great,"Robert Duvall makes this movie great. What an emotional story!A lot of intelligence to this film, and it is well worth your while. :)"
3,"Duvall got the ink, though O'keefe shines","The great Santini has becoem,for many the performance that put R Duvall on the board in big lights. The story[based on another typically great pat Conroy story] tells of a Marine flier post war,now taking clear aim at his children. The competition between he and his older son{okeefe in what should have been a career making performance]is painful to watch,to feel to identify with. The basketball game is one of the most uncomfortable moments I have ever had in a movie theatre. Duvall is superb,though I think his uber overberaing father in too over the top[the end,heroic,is a cop out]. The lovely Blythe Danner is excellent{as always},though it is Duvalls show. This same year Donald Southerland played a very different father in Ordinary people,a far more nuanced interesting role[for which he was not nominated for an academy award.unlike Duvall }Watching these two movies is quite ineteresting,though comparisons are odious.A good,though not great film."
3,Falls short,"Robert Duvall is great. There is no questioning his supremacy among all actors. One of his greatest roles was that of a looney marine in Apocalypse Now. I don't know if Apocalyse precedes or follows the great Santini. However, if it precedes, then Santini is a poor exploitation of a great character for Duvall.This movie portrays an extremely demanding and unforgiving father of four kids. It shows Duvall's character's strengths of leadership and drive are his greatest weaknesses when transferred to his private family life.The movie is very sentimental and has moments of trajedy and requisite humor. However, it fails to really push Duvall's character to the greatness he deserves. In the end, it is just a bland sort of family movie."
5,"Before there was Top Gun, there was The Great Santini","This movie depicts life as seen through the eyes of a military family. A heart warming, humorous and heartbreaking tale of how a wife must cope with her disciplined Marine Aviator, the way he disciplines their own children and her struggle to allow them all to grow.The scene when Ben turns 18 and accompanies his `ol man to the Officer's Club for his first drink is a classic! You'll laugh, you'll cry...and if you're not a military brat, you'll always wonder why."
5,DVD of The Great Santini,"Since I am on a reading kick of Pat Conroy's novels, after I finished this book, I wanted to see the movie while everything was still fresh in my mind. Having exhausted local resources to find this video, I checked out Amazon, found a used DVD, ordered it and it was in my home within a few days! Although it was not ""brand new"",its quality was wonderful and it cost me less than $20.00!"
5,Stanley Plane: A History And Descriptive Inventory - Sellens,"Alvin Sellens is the author for ""go to references"" on almost all types of older or antique woorkworking planes. This book ""The Stanley Plane: A History And Descriptive Inventory"" is a must for all collectors or those individuals interested in the history of woodworking and using old tools that made America the country it is. For one to understand what our early woodworking industry was about this is one of the books that should be ready reference. Great book, easy read, and reference."
2,"Big on hype, doesn't really work very well","For the voiceover artist, one of the problems is popping our ""p's,"" so we try every type of wind screen, store bought or hand made, to cut down on the plosives. I thought this screen would be a good idea, but it is metal, and so if you speak into it at just the wrong angle, you get a metallic-sounding recording. It is also dense, so my already very soft voice barely moves the meter when I speak through it. So my $30 piece of equipment is bent back from the microphone, still attached, but never to be used again. I think you'd do better to put a heavy cotton sock over your microphone."
4,Very durable,This popper stopper is very sturdy & seems like it can last a lifetime. It is actually a lot more heavy duty than it looks.
1,"Great, as always","I am a huge Danny Gatton fan and own a great deal of his recorded work. This CD is excellent as is everything I have from this incredible soul, from his CDs to his instructional DVDs. One minor point however; the last track on this CD certainly sounds like ""Melancholy Serenade"" as opposed to ""Harlem Nocturne"". Both great, but mislabled on this recording. Recommended highly."
3,Nothing special,"I got this for my 92 Sonoma because it was the only one I could find that didnt ""bump out"". Installed great. Perfect fit. Wish it had a CD pocket."
5,Sweet Soca sounds!,Classica SOCA!!!!! This is songs of my dear childhood. Everything was so innocent and rude at the same time. Once you start this album up... you can't help but dancing!
4,TO HIGH,GOOD MUSIC AND SINGERS BUT NOT WORTH $72.00 UNLESS THEY COME TO THE HOUSE TO SING IN PERSON. THEY GOT TO BE CRAZY AND WHO BUYS IT IS EVEN CRAZIER
4,Cute!,"I think I got into Blythe dolls after seeing so many of clothes and accessories made for them on etsy.com. I bought this book to get some ideas on how to dress up my dolls and I just thought it was so cute! Some of the outfits are really great and a few are just out there. Overall, this is a great book to flip through. I gave it 4 stars because I think it would be really cool if they showed us the process of creating the looks for these dolls."
5,I LOVE this book!!!,"This is the first Blythe book I have had, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I just love it! The pictures are so great and so unique..I have looked through it about 50 times already and each time I find something new. Its fab!"
2,What's the hype?,"I got hooked on photos of these dolls a few months ago and had heard all the talk about this book. Naturally,I wanted to see how all this Blythe mania started so I made the mistake of ordering the book instead of taking a trip to my local bookstore to have a look at it before buying. Had I done that....I would never have bought the book. Want to see some fabulous photos of these incredible dolls? Check out Flickr. They are much better than those in the book. Sorry Gina, wasn't impressed."
2,"Long, long trip to nothing.","I found this book incredibly slow and lacking any kind of real action that Mr. Bond was known for in his earlier books. This books story line was interesting, but in the end nothing really happens. I really enjoyed Bond's Vortex, Red Phoenix, etc., but this First Team series dosen't come close to comparing to the action and page turning excitement those books gave you. I don't know if hes just ""lending"" his name to Jim DeFelice's books or not, but I can't recommend this particular series to anyone."
2,Couldn't Finish It,I love Bond's books but this one just bogged down about halfway through. Not compelling at all. I couldn't force myself to finish it.
2,Not a classic. Just campy fun.,"This is not a mystery. It is a snapshot of the sixties, when the ""longhairs"" loved classical music, and the cool kids were learning to boogey. And when squares were bemoaning the beginnings of the youth revolution."
3,not news for a psychology major,i thought this book had good points that would be useful to parents who don't have psychology background - there are many references to various types of positive reinforcement and conflict resolution that would be helpful.
4,So glad RCA still makes it !,"I got mine as a gift and loved it. The style, features and ability topick a track to wake up to. I lost it in our house fire, have been searching on here 2 nights. Thank God I didn't give up, I found thesame one I had and am going to buy it.other than the small knob to tune in stations, I have no complaints.never had a problem. A big plus for me is the large easy to use volumecontrol right in front. Instead of hunting on the side for a little thing. Make the tuner knob a little larger and it's perfect.Oh yes, the adjustable snooze minutes is also a must, and great."
1,save your money,"This CD clock radio is well set up with easy to use buttons and controls. It's too bad it is so poorly built. The CD alarm feature stopped working in less than a month. The CD player is very noisy and makes scraping noises. The unit is well designed but is very disappointing from a quality standpoint. It makes me wonder about all RCA products now. It certainly makes me wonder why RCA would put such a poor quality product on the market. Apparently, they have little concern for quality. Don't let the nice appearance of the product fool you. It is not worth your hard earned money."
2,great clock radio but bad CD player,"this thing had all the features I was looking for, but after using the cd player I noticed that a significant portion of my CDs would start scraping against the plastic sides due to poor design. while it didn't damage the CDs, it was quite irritating to hear that scraping noise. the sound isn't very good either, but that's to be expected of clock radio cd players."
2,"Great Design, Poor Quality","I used the CD wake up for less than a week and it stopped working. It wouldn't even play a CD by just pressing the play button. I returned it and will not purchase this brand of CD clock radio again, even though I REALLY liked everything else about this clock."
3,The CD function doesn't work,"This is an excellent clock radio with great sound and plenty of buttons to fool with.We've never been able to get the CD function to work.The buttons are so complex, you can't figure how to set it to wake up.Setting the time is ALSO next to impossible, but when you get it, it works great."
1,Wake up to disappointment,"Do not buy this if you are planning to wake up to CDs or play CDs in your bedroom. It must be made with cheap optics because every CD plays as if it is scratched. All other functions work fine, but for the price, it should play flawlessly. Also, it is difficult to tune stations with the analog tuner. Your money is better spent on another product."
2,"Good Radio/Alarm, with some defects","My Mom and Dad bought this radio for their bedroom.When we first got it, it worked great!But, sometimes, the CD Player won't even play, or will play some tracks, and not others. (The CD Player will only work when it wants to.)The Tuner tunes in fine in Stereo Sound.I like it, but I'm thinking of returning it!"
3,"Not Bad For The Money, But...","I bought this two and 1/2 years ago to tide me over while I decided on a new CD stereo unit. It functioned very well as an alarm and as a radio, but from the beginning I had trouble with the CD player - at first, it would sort of stick, so some CD's would have to be manually loaded three or four times before it would play (so forget waking up to a CD).Now I am shopping for a new clock radio because over the past 2 1/2 years it has stopped playing CDs at all, the radio only works if it's in just the right spot, and the alarms are no longer dependable. This happened gradually, over time, not all at once. Not a bad unit for the cheap price - realistically, you could replace it every couple years - but I'm now shopping for something I can depend on a little longer - I'll probably go with the new Sony CD clock radio, also available here at Target online."
2,"Looks good and sounds good, when it works",I recently bought this alarm clock liking the features but the negatives quickly overpowered the positives. First off the cd playing function was not great. I would wake up to it trying to load the disk rather then play it. And the wake to a certain track just never worked. However the one thing that I despised was when I'd hit snooze it would flash the track
2,Where is the NAP function? Did you find it?,"I'm a bit lost with this clock. I bought it for the NAP feature as I loved the one on my previous clock. Low and behold, the manual does not even mention the feature, let alone how to set it. The box has the NAP function shown on the front, the RCA website shows the NAP function in the specs sheet, but the online manual is missing those instructions. I have been waiting over two weeks for a response from RCA.com. This weekend, it's back to the store with this one."
1,"IF,YOU WERE GOING TO BUY IT, YOU CAN'T ANYMORE!!!","YOU SHOULDEN'T BUY IT. IT BROKE AFTER ABOUT TWO MONTHS. SOMETIMES, THE DISPLAY WOULD SAY ""ERRR"" INSTED OF ""CD TR"" DON'T BUY IT!!!"
2,Many features....but cheap electronics.....,"You don't need to wait for your CD to wake you up, the mechanical drive of the CD will get you out of bed before thethe music even starts. Way to loud CD mechanism.The most annoying thing is it makes buzzing noises whan the CD of radio is on with the volume turned down. It has a really bad amp obviously.I took the first one back and got another one to make sure it was just not this one that buzzed, and the new one not only buzzed, but it would not read my burned CD's.On the plus side, it is one of the few CD Stereo clock radio's that has a dimmer switch on the LED's, so you won't be making hand puppets on the wall from the display."
2,Not worth diminishing the RCA name,"We have owned two of these clock radios. The first one broke within 30 days of owning it (CD just stopped working). We got a replacement, and that one broke within a few months. ... I would strongly warn you against the purchase of this unit. While the clock features all work well, the CD end of the unit is just horrible."
2,"The ""I'm not ready"" camera","I just returned this camera after two weeks of usage. It was *much* worse than my last Pentax point & shoot. The autofocus on this camera is terrible--I probably missed 10 Christmas and son's birthday pictures because the autofocus claimed it couldn't focus. (In darker areas, it uses a dinky white light to try to focus with. It didn't work well.) The zoom is also slow and jerky. And the worst part is the huge delay between the time you push the shutter and it taking the picture. I missed several other photos because the camera took a picture after the action had ended. The flash reach and recharge time was also poor, though all the new point and shoots seem to take a long time to recharge the flash.We just replaced this camera with a Pentax IQZoom 120SW. Better zoom, better autofocus, shorter shutter delay with about the same size and weight."
5,Great little analog camera,"I wasn't pleasantly surprised with this camera,despite the awful reviews. I didn't buy it on Amazon, but was able to obtain this little wonder machine second hand. It takes great panoramic photos and sharp snapshots like a rangefinder. It is a great backup to digital."
3,Easy to use with average results,"Overall an average camera. I would expect more from a trusted name like Nikon. At times, photos come out over-exposed. Generally, images are sharp and clear. Camera is light-weight and very easy to operate. Camera must be held still to get the sharpest photos. Sometimes daylight shots come out grainy. A good camera if your expectations are not too high."
5,Great Salsa,Beyond a doubt the best salsa you can buy. I wish stores would carry it. Years ago walmart had it and they quite stocking it. I check for this salsa in every grocery store I go to.
4,Keith is Back 4.5 stars,"This cd titled Just Me isn't better then Make It Last but I really enjoyed the slow and mature tones. Keith stayed on top of his game by making the bedroom booms a success. My top five is as follows:1. ""Me and My Girl""2. ""Butterscotch""3. ""Love you Better""- featuring Keyshia Cole4. ""What's A Man To Do""5. ""Just Wanna Sex You"""
5,He's back .......and stronger than ever,"All I got to say is that Keith Sweat did the dayum thing with this cd. I love this cd. It has me grooving and swaying and singing along with him. I think this is one of his best cd's in a long time. If you love Keith, you will love this one!"
5,SEXY IS BACK,THIS IS AN EXCELLENT CD. KEITH SWEAT IS A MUSICAL GENIUS OF LOVE. HE BOUGHT SEXY BACK REAL STRONG. A MUST HAVE...GINA
2,Not the best Keith Sweet.,"I was really excited when I saw this album was out. I purchased it immediately. I was anticipating classic Keith Sweat with a modern swing. He will be in concert in my area soon and I wanted my CD in hand! However, I have not been impressed. I have not been able to listen to an entire song. His voice has changed dramatically and the producers just grabbed some beats off the back shelf and dusted them off.This album has received strong reviews. But if you really want to know if the album is good, listen to the samples. They will help you decide. I wish I would have done this first. Since I can't get my money back, I am glad the CD was on sale.One thing is for sure, Keith still looks great! I am still a fan, just not a fan of this particular album."
5,Long Time Coming,Thanks Keith. This is a nice album. I am a true Keith Sweat fan from way back and this is one of his best CDs.
2,sans plus,"keith sweat mme si il est très bon vocalement , cette album n'est pas trés bien certain certain titre son génial; mais Keith sweat nous a produit des albums plus que sa,SA s'écoute après au gout de chaque un ."
5,just me,i luv this album regard the haters who dont like it i every track is off the hook on the real he's back wit a new bangin cd if your a keith sweat fan then this album is for you thats all we played in my house growing up was keith sweat all the greats my mom is a huge fan of him tight album.
5,Happy go lucky reminder of pre-war Paris,"This is a delightful album that belongs in the collection of anyone who imagines Paris before World War II, or who thrills at the smile of Maurice Chevalier. It is worth it just to hear Trenet's recording of ""Boum."" If you bought Adam Gopnick's book, ""Paris to the Moon"" you will particularly enjoy this album. Play this on a Saturday afternoon during a wine-filled lunch."
4,:),"hehe....now...this reminds me of the great village of french that still resist (asterix and his gang)....against all the odds of the english language music empire comes this italian that lives in germany and puts down his ideas in his native language....for some it would sound old fashioned in many cases, but than again he manages to blend everything....mambo, tango, jazz, blues and tarantella in a very surprising way....for me a discovered treasure....and i believe also for all of the italian or ""world"" music lovers....all you rockers forget about it!!"
3,smokey,"Nice collection of vinicio's best songs.My favourite is che cosse l'amore.Lyrics are absolutely fantastic,he is a true italian poet.Love his voice and love the music.Some songs are totally depressing though.Good Cd i am happy to have it in my collection."
2,I think he should change the title,"I also had a hard time with all the boasting ""stories"" about his life in general.I found myself wanting better definitions and ways to make the affirmations work.I was a little disappointed with this book. Although it was entertaining."
3,Good Introduction,"I thought that this was a good introduction to affirmations; however, I enjoyed his book ""The Trick to Money is Having Some"" more. Still, I recommend this book."
5,Well built utility cart,The cart came with easy to follow instructions. Had it together in no time and ready to use. Its sturdy and should work well for hauling what is needed. I am using it for the food bank supplies at our church and makes transporting packed groceries very easy.
4,U.S. Army artists in WWI,More than half the book is biographical materials on the individual artists and text regarding their involvement with the army. Actual reproductions of art work are fewer than I would have liked but are of good quality.
2,Enneagram Movie and Video Guide :,"I found this book to be disappointing. Some of the film examples were old or, perhaps, personal preferences, not examples most people would be familiar with. I do not think I'd purchase this if I had been able to skim more than a few pages."
3,Code has plenty of errors.,I was impressed by author's style in the begining chapters but I gave up after chapter 3 as I could not get the code to work. I could compile the BookBean EJB but I get plenty of errors(for the client code) even after following the instructions verbatim.What's the fun reading the book when you can't run the code?I hope author puts an errata on his website.
5,BDP at their best,"I wish this were available on DVD. There are some phenomenal performances on this tape. In my mind this is 'pure' hip-hop with all the glory the art form deserves-- vitality, connection with the audience, showmanship without resorting to glamour or shock value for anything. This material seems as vital to hip-hop as Charlie Parker or Miles Davis are to jazz. The little handheld-camera bits with Kris talking are pretty funny too."
5,Incredible discovery!,"Gabor Gado is a native of Hungary living in France. He plays the guitar in a wonderful way mixing tendencies from the modal music of his country with today's most innovative jazz. He is extremely creative in his approach and really deserves to be better known! His quartet plays wonderfully all around and gives here one of his best performances (along with ""Unknown Kingdom"" which was his next release). Matthieu Donarier plays the tenor sax, Sebastien Boisseau the double bass and Joe Quitzke the drums. Highly recommended! A must have!"
4,For word lovers out there,I love words--their meaning and their etymologies--so this is a great book for those of us who like to read and research. I especially enjoy how Michael Quinion starts off with the myth of the origin of a word then goes on to tell you the reality.
4,Not comfortable to read,"The text of this book is informative and entertaining, but the physical production of this book is not good. It looks as though they reduced the size of perhaps an original hardback book, including the type size, making for a sleazy cheap-feeling paperback. The font is a bit too small and light for comfortable reading, and the quality of the paper seems really poor with a yellow cast. Ordinarily I like paperbacks because they are lightweight and easy to hold. But I find this book to be physically annoying to read."
3,An interesting read,"This book is an interesting read, but not one that can lead to or even help toward to mastery of the subject (etymology). It does discuss method to some degree, but could benefit from more depth of coverage."
4,"Like the film, it invokes a meditative, strange desert mood",The music is repetitive (like all soundtracks) and very meditative. It is beautiful and strange and otherworldly. If you enjoyed the stunning visuals and spiritual mood of the film this soundtrack is mesmerizing.
2,Gullible,"The word gullible comes to mind. As in, this is a true story. Yeah right! Without it being true, this book is a waste of time. The situations that ""our hero"" gets into as the ""story"" evolves just keep getting more and more unbelievable. Maybe the author, Fiennes is beyond reproach in the UK, but I think he has done a bad job of pulling the wool over our eyes in trying to pass off soso fiction as truth."
3,SOMETIMES LESS IS MORE...,"This CD could have used some serious editing, to avoid having a great talent sound like a third rate lounge act. Some of the material is seriously dated and mediocre. Not even Charles Aznavour could save a track such as ""You Let Yourself Go"". Still, there are some absolute gems on this CD, sung as only Mr. Aznavour can. Tracks such as ""Yesterday When I Was Young"", ""She"", ""After Loving You"", ""Ave Maria"", ""La Baraka"", and ""A Blue like the Blue of Your Eyes"" make this CD worth having in one's collection."
3,Get the French recordings,"I have to agree with those who'd suggest getting the original French recordings of these and other Aznavour pieces. On a few tracks, like ""Old-Fashioned Way,"" of course, he's tremendous and the recording just drips with style, but on other tracks he sounds forced, drawn-out, as if someone is clipping his toenails while he's being recorded, or as if he's wearing a shirt collar that's too small. I hadn't been familiar with Aznavour's work, but have since dabbled with the French-language material he's done over the years and found them to be much more representative of this giant French star. Get this one for completeness, but get the French material to really hear what this legend can do."
3,you've never heard Aznavour until...,"... you hear him sing in spanish. believe it or not, the spanish versions of his hits sound even better than the french originals!"
5,"i really wanted the version in french, lovely, tender,","i love anything this man sings, but i thought this was in french, my wife said at least now you know what he said. i am 62, and have a love of his music since i was in french morrocco for 3 years in the 60's"
3,A little treasure,"I took the opportunity to watch this during the 2011 SF International Film Festival. This is a well acted character study about a seriously depressed 20 something who develops a bond with a teenager.The chemistry between Gerwig and Alexander is credible and the story never strains to push them into a romantic tryst. I was also impressed by the Delaware setting. Too many movies want to stick with NYC/LA or other big cities, while ignoring the rest of the country.I'm looking forward to revisting this one on DVD"
1,Don't waste your money!!!!!,I bought this from walmart and couldn't even believe the first 3 pages of the book! I have decided it is NOT appropriate for my teen and plan to return it to WM and recommend that they remove it from their shelves!!
1,Hearing the story.,"I had high expetations for this book, but unfortunatly, it was very disappointing. It feels like you're being told about something from someone who was there, not like you are actually there like good books make you feel.Nothing interesting happens until the middle/end and even then it only looks at that one thing. Basically, this book was a real let down & if you're going to read it, get it from the library first."
2,Wasted potential,"The potential that this book could have is so high. It's a great concept - and something that its audience can relate to. However, it barely scratches the surface of the potential that the format could have. Although it feels a bit realistic, it almost feels like there's too much energy focused on the ""plot"", and not enough on, you know, what people actually talk about over IM.The ending feels rushed - not everything gets completely resolved, and it almost feels like a deux ex machina. Not a very good book."
2,i guess it is good....,"i would give this book a 2/5 because it is very boring at some parts... but it is okay, i guess. my friend loved it and told me to read it, and i did. i wasn't... like... dying for a sequal or something, but it is good. i thought it was really cool how all the pages are instant massages, especially since i like to im. anyway, it swears in it a lot so if you are a younger person, i suggest you dont read it. it is an OKAY book if you want to read it."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"As a librarian, I try to read reviews before ordering books to place in our high school. I was intrigued with the description of this book's format (Instant Messaging between friends). All reviews praised the book's uniqueness and its insight on the lives of three high school girls, however, this is not a book I will be putting on the shelf. The profanity throughout the book was unnecessary. I would have a difficult time justifying it to an irate parent who might complain about the explicit language. In addition to the language, the plot of the book was slow. The conflicts of each character did not fully surface until the last 40 pages of the book. I will be donating this book to our public library. It has SOME merit but it is not a battle I choose to fight with the school board if this book were ever challenged."
1,Wouldn't suggest reading this book,I got this book for a masters course on adolescent literature... let me begin by saying I would NOT recommend buying this book. The whole book is about 3 young girls having a conversation and at times is quite risque. For what is supposed to be a young adult novel some of the subject matter belongs at a college reading level... though the writing itself is that for a 6th grade audience. Terrible book! I've read many young adult novels (for career purposes) and have enjoyed most of them... this however is not the case with this book!
2,Gag me with a spoon :-(,"I've had many serendipitous discoveries in the library, and quite a few were pleasant surprises. For some reason (probably random selection) the local library had pulled ttyl from the shelves and propped it up for display. The cover is cutish and the inside cover description sounded different so checked it out.The first few pages start off OK but quickly degenerate. For one thing, it's not very realistic. Even if you're really quick with your thumbs no one is going to type such verbose IM/SMS/text messages. And don't HS girls have other topics besides boys and creepy old teachers and sex? Maybe the author did develop the characters deeper than that, but I don't know because after about 25 pages I chose to use my time reading more worthy material. To each his own, I guess."
1,Even AIM-bots know this is a bad idea.,"TheQD: So what do you think of this book ""TTYL?""SmarterChild: I don't really have any thoughts about this book ttyl.TheQD: do you not find it demeaning?SmarterChild: Sometimes.TheQD: Do you think it will kill us all?SmarterChild: Nah, I don't think so. Maybe, though.TheQD: Yeah... maybe...SmarterChild: Maybe not.TheQD: No, maybe yesSmarterChild: OK. Fine.Imagine wading through a whole book of that. Don't just think of yourself, though, think of the poor, exploited AIM-bots. Think of the English language. Think of America. Think of Freedom.Not buying this book is a not buying this book for our future, for America, for democracy."
3,Good for Tweens,"I thought this was an interesting concept, as the entire book is written in the form of instant text messages.There are three voices, best friends, Zoe, Angela and Maddie. Each has a different font for ease of reading (you don't even need to look at the screen names, even though they are there), each of the characters has a distinct voice and brings a different set of values and attributes to the story.It is set in high school and revolves around the things you'd expect it to, kids being crap to each other, popularity, boys and friendship.It was a quick read, not a bad one for me (as an adult) and probably a really good one for a tween; it reminded me of what it was like to be that age (15), I guess that is indicative of its success in setting the tone."
2,so like obviously...,"The author typed 'you' as 'you' when she wrote it, and went through Fin&Replace and replaced all 'you's with ""u"". I can see she's making an effort to give the book a real IM-feel, but nobody really uses 'u' and 'ur' and '2' for 'too'. That's just strange. I agree, nobody talks like that. no, not even teenagers. It's a misrepresentation of over half the teenage community. As easy and fun it would be for me to believe that all teenagers girls like to talk about are sex, boys, bars, and gossip, I don't. The pink contemporary style cover isn't what it looks like."
5,"LOL , with a dose of serious empowerment","In TTYL, Myracle puts a cyper-spin on the classic epistolary novel. Who knew such a compelling (and ultimately touching) story could be told entirely through IM messages? And while Myracle is often laugh-out-loud funny (LOL), ultimately the book encourages some very serious virtues: loyalty, self-confidence, and integrity."
4,Bye girl! TTYL!,"This book takes place on IM. The characters are Angla(Snow Angel), Zoe(zoegirl), and Maddie(madmaddie). They are all starting high school and begining to like and go out with somw guys. I would recomnd this book for ages 12 and older because it has sexual cooments and it has very bad words that kids who are not mature enough to haddle the book. Another thng is about it is that is that it has some very werid things like one of the girls goes out with a teacher."
1,What is our world coming to?,"I want to know if I read the same book as the people who gave this thing 5 stars. Reading TTYL made me want to break down in tears. Is that how society truly views teenage girls? As a sophomore in high school, trust me on this, no middle/jr/high school female acts like that. The whole book basically made it seem as if all we're interested in is boys, sex, and boys. I was deeply disappointed in the fact that the author was promoting this. Although, I have more issues with the publisher who thought this one was a winner. And I don't believe anyone on this planet, or the next, types like that.Do yourself a favor, and don't even bother reading TTYL. You've much better things to do with your time, like watching the grass grow."
1,Sex and The City For Kids (without good writing),"Just picked up this winner in the Young Adults section of Border's for my about to turn thirteen year old daughter. As defined in the book description the target audience is 13-17. At least the creators of Sex and The City target their show to adults and don't enter it in this category. However the subject matter and crude descriptiveness in this book could have found it's way onto that show. If you don't believe me, pick it up at the store and see if you would be willing to read pages 10-11 aloud to a group of junior high girls'.(although doing so would probably subject you to arrest) It's bad enough the pressures on young girls' to be sexualized everywhere they look, but it would be nice if we could turn them loose in the literature for kid's; especially when the book jacket tells us of the author's credentials in writing for young people. Perhaps Larry Flynt might have a place for Ms. Myracle in his Letter's to the editor section."
1,NOT TWEEN READ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My daughter said that she saw someone at camp reading this book and she wanted it.She not a big reader, so when she says she wants a book I buy it. This books appearance makes it look like a young reader book- I thought it was odd that it was in the young adult section; however it had some cussing it in- no big deal to me. To cut to the chase here and what I think is a big deal - about 10 pages in my 12 yr old daughter asked me ""What's this word?"" It was ""ejaculate"", I then read on a few lines - It was talking about a girl acting like a whore at a party and that she squirts when she comes.I'm writing this as a warning to any parent of a tween that wants to read this and you are not prepared to deal with the questions this book will arise."
5,Awesome book,"I really enjoyed this book. It's about three girls and their friendship. It's told entirely in the format of instant messages.Even though I graduated high school 12 years ago (eek!) and have never instant-messaged (I prefer email), I totally related to this story. The three girls are Maddie, who's kind of a rebel; Zoe, a ""people-pleasing straight-A student""; and Angela, a flower-child romantic.The fluctuations and in-fights in the girls' relationship are very real, as is the affection they show for each other. Their travails with boys are lovingly detailed. Angela has to get over a boy who cruelly dumps her, while Maddie is rejected by a ""popular"" friend outside their circle. Zoe has to fend off a young teacher's advances, but she likes him back...or does she?Read TTYL, you won't regret it."
3,Quick read - kids will enjoy,"My daughters read this book and found it a quick read and enjoyable. I read it and found it of little interest, however I could understand how the day to day drama of a few teenagers might appeal to some teens and preteens. I found little objectionable material or topics.This is not a must read, however it might make a nice gift since it will very likely be read.This author's other books, specifically L8R is an ""R"" rated book and should be avoided."
4,"Not a classic, but it may have its place","First, a warning. I am an older teacher who read this because I sometimes teach a college class in adolescent lit. I appreciate the author was able to tell a whole story through I.M. and associated devices. Wasn't the first novel in English ""Pamela"" a series of letters? I was surprised the plot was pretty good. It reminded me of ""Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants."" Many parents will find the language and subject matter edgier than they would like. I read this title checked out of the library and someone had started to underline all the ""dirty"" words and then had given up. My assumption is that the publisher aimed it at girls buying it for themselves and not parents or teachers buying it for them. Boys will find very little of interest here unless they are doing research about the opposition camp. This is not a classic, but if it keeps girls reading and encourages them to move to other titles, that's ok."
4,A three tracked Roller Coaster,"The book was over all a very gripping one! The entire book is written as if the reader is reading a conversation on an instant messenger program. With that, many acronyms commonly used when two people instant message each other are used, and those that are strict about English and grammar might be irritated with how the book is written. The plot was intriguing, despite the played out storyline of three best friends with different personalities, and their personalities tear them apart. When reading the book, the way that is is written keeps it engrossing. Plus, each of the girl's characters were nicely developed and it is very easy to grow attached to them. In general, the book can be described as a three tracked roller coaster looping around each other to make a good read for readers."
3,Maybe we won't TTYL,"Oh my, what a book. I will start out by saying that this book is definitely not for children. There is alot of inappropriate content on almost every page. It was like it was teaching kids to talk junk and saying it was okay. No, it's not. I have to say, though, it was actually a pretty decent book other than the profanity and disturbing content. Some of the conversations were hysterical, which really brought out the light in the book. But, I do suggest that you should at least be in junior high to read this series. Sixth or seventh grade at the least. (: -Bookworm12"
1,omg lyk ttyl is teh kewlness!!11eleventy1!!q,"... Please. I understand why some people like this book, as IMing is really, really popular, but a whole book written like this? ...I found out about in seventh grade, and was like 'wtf?' I tried it. I thought at the time it was... okay... Boring at times, and it really leaned on the stereotype that the only thing teenage girls talk about are boys, boys, and oh! look! more boys. But I was cool with that at the time. I finished it in an hour then returned it, forgetting about it.A year later. I've become obsessed with the internet, and been plunged into the world of fanfiction, where netspeak is dominant, and lovers of the original works work bitterly to defend their beloved canon. I re-read this. And the tears fall.I've no problem with IMing. I love it. Just... don't put it in books."
2,Corny,"This book was very corny. I dont know, maybe I am too old to read it, i am 14, maybe this is for littler kids. I thought it was really unrealistic and all the drama that goes on in the book doesn't really go on like that! I would not recommend it."
1,Yeah. Uhh...,"It's books like this that are going to ultimately cause the gradual crumbling down of the English language as readers become more and more illiterate, using letters instead of words, and smiley faces instead of written, explained emotions.As a writer, I believe censorship is wrong and believe in art and free expression and all this. This may be one of those books that would merit bringing back book burnings."
1,Inappropriate,"Selling sex to kids- that's all that this irresponsible author is doing. Don't waste your money, or your kid's brain cells."
5,Complete and Comprehensive,"I found this book to be one of the most comprehensive books on this subject I have read. I appreciated the way in which the information was presented - both in terms of the way it was organized, but also the way it made complex ideas easy to understand. Dorothy Siegel. Credit Manager. Fast Memory Inc."
4,Compelling portrayal of Theresienstadt,"Theresienstadt was not an extermination camp, but that does not mean the inmates in this camp had it easy. Starvation was rampant, as was disease, and the Nazis used Terezin (as it was also known) as a ""model"" camp, deceiving people into believing that the Jews were not so badly treated after all, the worst deception being perpetrated in front of the Red Cross when they visited the camp during the war. Many of the inmates were eventually selected for deportation to the death camps, including women and children. The most interesting aspect of this film (for me) was the rare archival film footage of the camp and its inmates. There is also footage of German propaganda films of the period. Included is compelling testimony by survivors of the camp. Recommended."
1,Tiem line Error,"Have not read the book, but in the brief review the date 1941 was given for the Red Cross visit. The actual date was June 1944. In 1941 the camp was just being converted to a concentration camp and there were pratically no prisoners at that time so naturally the Red Cross would not find any intolerable conditions as existed in fact in 1944. These facts are irrefutable. I know because I am a survivor of Theresienstad."
3,Holocaust: Theresienstadt,"Too repetative. It became boring, especially for such an important reminder of evil in our world. I can't say that I would recommend it to anyone."
5,great for our small child and a basement door,"We have a door to the basement that opens into the stairwell. This leaves the knob about a foot too high for our child to reach. I installed this knob handle with a short loop of ribbon. Now our child can easily open the door. It doesn't come with the ribbon, so be prepared to add one yourself.Installing it was very easy. Just a philips screwdriver. The instruction diagram isn't entirely clear on where to install the foam strip. It does inside the lip edge of the ring. This lets the ring grip the back side of the doorknob. Other than that it was a breeze to install."
2,Feels Unsafe,"Three major complaints.1. Screws provided extend beyond back of handle about 3/4"" when used on a residential door knob. This provides a sharp set of edges on the open screw that can and did catch on the whorls of finger resulting in torn skin if knob is grabbed instead of the handle. Needs to have screw that is 3/4"" shorter than ones supplied which I changed.2. Due to use of soft foam as the anti slip material between handle and knob, the handle rotates on door knob if door locked and screws not tightend down extremely tight.3. Lastly, the large area around knob and the flex of handle gives unit a flimsy feel, causing wife saying it feels unsafe to her so I was forced to remove.But of alll the other options available it is the cheapest one I found on the web.. So buy and install shorter screws, 1"" to 1 1/4"" 1/4""-20 Phillips head screws and tighten it up and it works fine (for my neighbor who broke both wrists)."
5,Simply Fantastic,"This CD was a complete impulse buy after seeing this band in concert (and meeting them before and after the show) in Nebraska and to my relief, my impulse was right on in buying this CD. I absolutely LOVED their show and this CD is a great reminder of the greatest time I have ever had with my girl friends on a girl's night out. This is what music is all about. It is pop-rock with an alternative, edgy feel. Good music and I LOVE ""Hey Luv"". It has to be my favorite of songs."
3,Too Many Details Make for a BORING Read,"First off, this book is well researched and a good read until you get to the ""World Leader"" part of the book. Even though that is the part that talks about the Cuban Missile Crisis, it is sketched out beforehand. By the time I got to the ""World Leader"" part of the book, I felt like it was a chore to read; something that had to be done! I highly recomend Robert Dallek's ""An Unfinished Life"" instead of this one because Dallek's book flows at a much faster pace and is easily the best JFK book out there!"
2,Over rated,"This game is frustrating and will make you want to bust your TV, if not your Playstation. Say what!, the only way to advance is to get first place? Okay, after time and time again, once you know the courese and can probably race it blind folded you can get it. You ever play Driver? Remeber the very last level when you drive the president and these black cars are constantly ramming you? Think of how that made you feel. You will get that same feeling when you place this game."
2,good at the time,"This game was good at the time it was made, but there r better street racing games. If u want a good MC game then get MC 3 DUB edition."
5,Best racer ever.,"When I first popped this game into the PS2, my jaw dropped. I played for 5 hours straight in 1 sitting, and im not a very big gamer. It has everything Gran Turismo 3 has, but it has a much bigger fun element. Not buying this game should be considered the 8th Deadly Sin."
1,Midnight club 2 : review of order,"for this Game it is a great game for racers alike but...as far as the order is concerned:the person whom I ordered it from gave me a faulty item: it did not work nor was it even playable..it LOOKED like it was described but dont let it fool you. it didnt work..it wasnt even worth my time to go pawn it off...next time... be up front to your customers.have a great night, God bless you."
4,This game is the nizzle fashizzle,"This game is off the hook. You will love this game. Race others and kick a$$ and also get your a$$kicked. There are no cons in this game is excellent. I you buy this game I must tell you that when you are on the Paris track you actually feel like you are in Paris. You alsom pass real places that are in Paris like the ""Vasusha Vecoke"" I know I have been to Paris. Same for La and Tokyo nad Los Angeles.The night setting gets you all in the mood. With choices to choose for music for Jewl to 50cent. you will absolutly love it. The interductoion was amazing. Like I said this game is the nizzle fashizzle"
3,Pretty Cool,"If it were not for the addition of motorcycles to this second edition this game would be a waste of time. Midnight Club 2 does a pretty good job with the motorcycles as far as handling and what not. Another good game if you like bikes is Speed Kings, not very well known but the things you can do on the bikes in Speed Kings is too much fun, wheelies, stoppies, and numerous others. I'm not sure why this game is still half a bill but whatever..."
1,good for its time,this is the worst racing game ever. it may have been goo din 2001 but by todays standerds its horrible. gta is so much better. the entire game is very dark worse than any ive seen . dont buy this - despite its good rep.
1,This Game S-U-C-K-S,"The reason I am saying this game sucks is because after at least 1-4 months I quit playing this. I have not played this game for more than over 2 months, last time I played this game was probably in May.Good:NONEBad:Poor Voice ActingYou are not able to customize your carsFor those of you who plan on buying this game, do not, because this game really sucks."
2,This is a really dumb game.,"Don't let young kids play this game. Street racing is pretty fun, with all the turns and so on. But when there are people walking in the street you're racing on, then hit them it turns out to be a pretty dumb game.Your racing around a corner and wham! What just hit the windsheild!? You can't even slow down in time to miss the poor little person in the road.This is how the game works, you find a racer in a city, flash your brights, follow the racer around the city trying to miss the people walking on the street and the side walks, you follow to the next big race (6 cars), you race, hitting people with your car, turn a corner, hit more people, race on a freeway, take an exit, turn a corner, hit more people, and do the same thing over and over again.This game is just plain stupid.Try something like GT3 or 4X4 EVO, these are ""clean"" racing games.Game Wizard"
1,If I could give it a 0 i would!,"This was the worst game I have ever played. I am an avid gamer with some of the best records known in gaming history, and I will tell you, all my fellow gamers out there, that this has to be the most pointless, stupid and boring game that has ever existed on this planet. Not to mention the graphics .... Don't waste your money on it- it's not worth it. Rather spend it on GTA Vice City- way better use of your money folks. Outie."
5,BEST RACING GAME EVER!!![.],"I didn't like Midnight Club 1 too much. Then my friend told me that Midnight Club II was better. I went to the store and brought it. I loved it. It's way better than the first one. The graphics are real good. There are different game modes to choose from, like Career Mode, Online Play, and Capture The Flag. There are 3 places in the game: L.A., Paris, and Tokyo. This game is fun because you can also jump from high places and land hard. You can also boost up a little by using the NOS. The NOS waists though. The cars are the tightest thing in the game. You have to unlock the cars and motorcycles by winning races in career mode. Every time you unlock a new car, that car has a certain skill that the rest of the cars don't. For example, the Jersey XS, which I unlocked by beating the champ of L.A., has 2-Wheel Driving. You can also change the colors of the cars. I would recommend this game to anyone. Go to the store and buy Midnight Club II now."
4,the BEST Racing Game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"when it comes to illegal racing, MC2 has got it all! I wish you could customize your car, but its still looooaaads of fun. Need for Speed Underground is OK, but it's not too realistic (except for customization). In MC2, the nitrous boost actually gives you a boost, and you're also free from restricting ""boundaries"" (the red & white striped walls). Best racing game ever. Period."
3,good game,"This is a good game. I find it hard, though. But the graphics are amazing, the streets are cool, and the cars are great looking. The cheats don't work for the career mode. Here are the pros and consProsAmazing graphicsAwesome carsGreat streetsConsThe charactersDifficultCheats don't work for the Career Mode"
5,THIS GAME ROCKS!!!!!!,"This game is a very fun game. The cars are so cool and everythingis realistic! It would of been cooler if they had a hummer in it.Here are the things that are good and bad about it.Good,1.There are tons of cool and realistic cars in it.2.I like the missles and guns in it.3.Much better than Test drive for PS2.Bad,1.The game is fun but after awhile your just like, I don't feel like playing right now. But after a day when you play again it gets better. And then it does it like that, over and over.2.If you are at a cool place thats hard to finf like a boat and you by accident fall off, they put you back to where you startedoff.Over all this is a GREAT GAME!!!!!"
5,Online play is awesome!,"...online play... it's unbelievable!! Framerate is great, and I haven't seen any hiccups during play so far. Get some practice before you join online or you'll get wasted."
4,Great music,This is the first CD that I got of this band and it is an enjoyable listen. SHANE is a great heartfelt tune. I love the guitar work of Barret who channels a Pink Floyd sound. Nolan is also present on keys...that should make anyone want to purchase this.
5,THE BEST PENDRAGON ALBUM,"If you've never listened anything about Pendragon, this album is the beST beginning. Almost all songs are espectacular, The Voyager , And We'll Go Hunting Deer , Shane , Back In The Spotlight , Prayer, Sister Bluebird , Queen Of Hearts: The Last Waltz are wonderful. I bought WINDOW OF LIFE - BONUS TRACK (excellent too), BELIEVE and THE MASQUERADE OVERTURE. All of them are great, but THE WORLD and WINDOW OF LIFE are 5 stars."
4,COMPLETE 'FALLEN DREAMS AND ANGELS' CD INCLUDED WITH TOFF RECORDS VERSION!!,FYI: I just wanted to let the purchaser know! Rock on!
2,Not as great as the others,"I bought this as a follow-up to the same authors' book, ""Life in a Drop of Water"", which was excellent. It had the full attention of my 3 and 4 year olds, and they still retain much of the information in that book a year later. This book was not at all similar in style as that book, and lost their (and my) interest rather quickly. I will try this again with them when they are older."
3,Item Great ! SHIPPING on the EXPENSIVE side.,"I absolutely love these !The product was very good & fresh,but the shipping was on the expensive side."
4,sweet tooth,bought these for my husband sister for christmas because she likes them. tasted a couple. they are good. i don't eat much sugar so they were a little to sweet to me.
2,"Haribo gummi candy raspberries, 5-lb bag","I was so excited to find these online for such a great price. I rarely write reviews but after biting into one of these all I can say is ""yuk!"" For some reason I thought these were like those tasty little raspberries you pick upat the Cracker Barrel. They are definately not! Hope the rest of the family isnt as picky as I am :-("
1,Not the same product that I remembered tasting...,"I didn't like them at all. WAY TOO SWEET! They're not as gummy and chewy as you'd expect from Haribo. I didn't taste a whole lot of raspberry flavor either; maybe I'd had better ones. Originally, I thought there were the same gummies I received at Christmas from a friend who's living in Europe; but boy, was I disappointed. My husband and kids didn't like them; my husband then brought the candies to work - they weren't a hit either. I tried to give the candies away and nobody wanted them. I read the other reviews before I bought these and except for 1 review, all the other customers seemed to love these. Well, good for you if you love them; we definitely don't enjoy them at all."
3,So-so,"I don't really like candy but I absolutely LOVE Jelly Belly Raspberries and Blackberries. I found these when I was getting ready to order and, based on the other reviews, thought I'd give them a try instead. Mistake. They are okay, but the non-parallels (sp?) are chalky tasting and the fruit is too sweet and slightly chemical tasting. I have 5 pounds now to go through. Luckily my daughter is not overly particular."
2,Not great,"Package was opened during shipping. Bag is a brittle cellophane that was splitting while removing from box. Candy itself too sweet, slightly stale, had a grainy sugary texture, and the jelly inside was not as smooth and flavorful as it should be."
1,"Candy great, packaging and Amazon's handling abysmal",We are scheduled to receive a bag of Raspberry gummis once a month. Today we received the candy for the second time with the bag slit and the candy throughout the box. The box contained other items. It was evident that whoever packed the box knew the bag was slit and tried to conceal it by putting it upside down and thus guaranteeing that all the candy was contaminated.
3,Disappointed,The candy pieces were bigger than expected. The black pieces were not very tasty and there was more of them than the red pieces. Will not order them again.
5,Wonderful,"Great CandyMy husband LOVES these. We can sometimes find them at one store around here and in only in the bulk candy, they are usually hard and just not goodThese were great, fresh and quite enjoyable :) Ty"
5,Best candy from childhood,This candy is great! Huge bag - will last awhile. The kind you remember from childhood.
1,chemical taste -- ewww!,"I'm a big fan of many gummi candies -- especially the Jelly Belly version of this product, but it can be expensive and harder to find. I thought I would give this brand a try -- BUT WHAT A MISTAKE!!! The candy is giant, the ""seeds"" are waxy balls, and the gel inside has no flavor at all. The red ones especially have a chemical taste. Amazon issued a refund and I'm throwing these away. Save your $$$ for the real thing!"
5,Love this Candy!,"When I recieved it, I couldn't believe the amount of candy I purchased for the reasonable price. Very yummy."
1,too beady,"i didn't like this product at all and ended up tossing it. the soft inner part of the candy tasted really good but the hard, beady outer part was a headache. i ended up having to peel/scrape all the outer beady thingies off the candies just to get to the soft, jelly/gummy part of the candy. in the end it was just not worth the effort so i took it as a loss and threw it all away. since every person is an individual and has their own tastes, if you want to give it a try go for it. as for me and my opinion, i didn't like these candies at all as long as those outer beady thingies were on them. by-the-way, the beady thingies had no raspberry fruity taste to them, only the inner gummy part had flavor. the beady parts just had a sweet, flavorless taste."
1,sad,"I ordered this item which came in a flat rate USPS box. I got an Identical box from another vendor. My purchase from Online Candy Store was $29 with $35 shipping. The identical flat rate box from another vendor was $9.80 shipping. There is something seriously wrong with this kind of service. NOT WORTH THE PRICE, DO NOT RECOMMEND ORDERING FROM THIS SITE. If I had not given this as a gift, I would have returned it."
1,Hate it!,"I thought it was nasty, you shouldn't rely too much on reviews, which I mistakenly did. If you're looking for to sweet candy with a lot of texture and a gummy inside then this might be for you. My advice is to buy a smaller bag to try it out, or you'll be stuck with candy you don't want. It's either a like or dislike.Haribo Gummi Candy, Raspberries, 5-Pound Bag"
4,too cool! they are Great!!,"took about 9 days to come. they were in great shape in the bag. dont like that they rope you into buying two bags to get the free shipping. making your purchace $28 for two bags. they are soft and chewey. and dont stick to your teeth. they are the Real Rasberry candies you remember!! I used them for valentines favors in cute little celephane baggies, they looked very cute. im very happy with the purchace, however the sour cherries were a dissapointment."
5,Raspberry addict,"I was so glad to find these raspberry candies available on Amazon. They are rarely found in any stores near me. They have always been a favorite of mine. I suck off the little dots and then chew the jelly center, a double treat! They came quickly and I will definitely order them again. Thanks Amazon"
5,I love these candies!,"These candies are my favorite! I am so glad I found them and can buy them in bulk, although they didn't last very long in my house! I am looking forward to my next shipment."
3,Not a Reference Work,"Authors of non-fiction books who don't provide an index should be taken out and shot. Jerry Vermilye deserves no better. Great Italian Films may be useful as a coffee table decoration, but that's about all. Look elsewhere if you're seeking rich analysis."
1,beware of this buggy software,"I bought this to pulish a small book with a home business. It may say ""pro"" in the title, but even an amateur user would find this software a nightmare. I might as well have thrown my money in the street for the good this software did me. There are numerous, frustrating bugs. It would appear that this software was not very well tested before it's release. Even the download patch solves none of the problems with this poor piece of software. I have migrated to Adobe, and advise all potential buyers to beware of this software. In my opinion, this software isn't worth the plastic disc it comes on."
1,city that never sleeps - replublic pictures home video -,"I am sure this is a fine film. But I received a ""bad tape"", which was promoted as ""new"". In fact it was new and it was in its original sealed wrapping. However it was a ""bad tape"". The clue should have been that I paid only $5 or $6 for a ""new"" VHS Tape. The other clue was that it was from ""Republic Pictures Home Video"". I don't remember who I ordered it from. But if you see this film promoted as ""new"" at that ""low"" price and it is from ""Republic Pictures Home Video. Buyer beware.Jim E"
1,Pointless Rambling,This book is more about the self absorbed author than Peru or the Inca. Hugh Thompson's idea of exploring seems more like pointless wandering. I would certainly not recommend this book to anyone
5,Best Alias Novel,Awesome non-stop thriller that was suspenseful enough to have you holding your breath in the great characters' time of dispare!!!!
2,Has nothing to add to the discussion about body image,"I don't know what the purpose of this film was other than to re-establish the obvious fact that gay men are visually oriented and there is a large subsection of gay men who place their looks above everything else. In the film, we meet a lot of them. Most of them aren't really that attractive but they are self-confident, muscular, trendy and semi well-maintained. And several of them (at least three who were interviewed) are porn stars, although only one of them is identified as such. So, the subjects are maybe not exactly representative of the greater gay male population. We also meet some outcasts (bears, goths) who bravely defy the stereotypical images and live to tell about it. But the ""hot"" guys all seem kind of dumb and not self-aware. What is the documentary trying to say about these men? I really have no idea. It offers no healthy alternative and no new perspectives on the culture of body image. It's as superficial as its subjects."
2,As shallow as the subjects,"This ridiculous film takes the first 45 minutes to make this point: Attractive people get more attention and strokes.Duh. I think we all know that. In the entire film, there's about five minutes of actual discussion and analysis of why many gay men are body-obsessed and why so many don't put an effort into doing something more meaningful with their lives than looking good.So the film is pretty much a waste of time - if you watch it for eye candy, you'll probably be disappointed, as the guys are not as hot as they think they are. If you watch it to gain some insight, you'll be sorely disappointed."
4,good value,I felt this was a good price for this replacement motor and fan. Service was excellent! The only thing I would suggest for those installing this fan motor is the addition of rubber washers at the mounting bolts. I felt mine was a little too noisy due to possible imbalance of the fan. I reinstalled using rubber washers and that made a significant difference.
3,Dirty motor,"I have a 681-A/681F-A fan which has the fan blade on the opposite side of the housing from the motor. My fan was barely turning. I decided to take it apart to see if I could reverse it (to look like the BP27). During the process I cleaned all the junk that had accumulated on the motor. I plugged it in and it ran fine but made a terrible whine. I then put a dab of grease on the shaft at each end where it contacts the housing. One I did that, the motor ran like new again. Suggest cleaning before replacing."
5,Perfect!,"I bought this replacement motor for a Nautilis N678-C and it works great......very low sound, only took about 10 minutes to install. Great purchase, and much cheaper than buying an entire new unit."
4,Solid Replacement Part,Had no problems installing this replacement motor and fan combo in my unit. The entire job took less than 15 minutes. There doesn't seem to be much difference between the old motor and this new one. Performance is as expected. It runs like the old one before it died. Cheap and easy solution.
4,Works like the original,"This replacement fan motor bolts right in and works like the original, and slapping it in is a lot easier than replacing the whole unit. If your original is making a ton of noise, this is a cheap/easy fix.Don't expect miracles--it won't be as quiet as a good modern vent fan."
4,BP27 Fan Motor/Wheel,This motor/wheel is not an exact replacement for Nutone fan/light model 668N. I later found out that the part number 53709000 is correct. I don't know if there is a Broan number for it or not. I was able to make the Broan BP27 work for my 668N but it was a pain. Verify the correct replacement part with Nutone rather than trusting a Google search.
3,some Christmas joy here,"I purchased cd when first released many years ago,and i like the music and singer but not the overall feel of the cd. Manchester is certainly one of my all time favorite artist, and i do play the cd at least once every year. I believe the arrangements are what has always been my issue w the cd. I really like uptempo holiday music and for the most part i find the selection done in jazz and maybe some blues. Melissa does bring me joy maybe just not all of the songs here. I have tickets to see her in late feb 2012 in Las Vegas and i know for certain, she will bring me much joy and i am looking very forward to this."
3,Not much Fun,"My daughter has had this item for about 3-4 months now and still does not care for it. It's great to be able to carry it around, but provides extremely little fun.Whether it be next to the Doll House, or out and about, it still won't catch her interest.She will use the girl that comes with it, but other than that, the rest is not used."
5,The king of southern food does it again.,"After virtually wearing out the pages of Marvin Woods' first book, I came across this one and immediately snatched it up. Once again, Mr. Woods brings fourth classically elegant dishes of the south with a more modern flair. These dishes are the sort that not only offer down home flavor to any meal, but will offer the romanticism of the old South. Any guest at your home will be thrilled to be treated to these regional specialties. You need not be a professional cook to be successful with these dishes, following the directions will yield wonderful results that will have you and your guests harkening back to the spanish moss mansions of the deep south. Buy this book, you wont be disappointed."
1,Motorcycle Maintenance Textbook,The book was too general. I bought it for scooter repair and it covered very little. It's more of a general reference book. I sent it back.
5,Definately an album you should buy!,"I never intended to buy this album, I just listened to it in the shop waiting for a friend. What can I say? After just 3 minutes I bought it and it remains one of the best albums in my collection. Before listening in the shop, I'd never heard of Me One and since have not heard anything more. This is full of such laid back music that can be listened to loud by itself or just in the background to provide a calming mood. Like other reviews I think this album was grossly under-promoted in the UK. Great because it means radio stations are not overplaying it, bad because so many people don't know it exists. Definately an album that everyone should have in their collection, I REALLY recommend this!"
4,trial and error,the book is nice but the amazon price was more than the marked price! how did that happen?
5,Nice system for the money,"We got this mainly for playing CD's and tapesfor the kids. For the money, it's nice soundingand easy to operate."
5,One of the best CDs I have ever heard,"This CD is fantastic. After buying it, I became one of Lisa Stansfield's fan. If you liked the remixes taken from Ray of Light, you're gonna love this CD."
5,LISA--NEVER GONNA FALL!,"THIS CD HAS MANY OF THE HITS BY THE POWERFUL VOICE OF MS STANSFIELD--TREMENDOUS MIXES--SUCH AS I'M LEAVIN(HIT #1 BILLBOARD CLUB CHARTS 4/11/1998)ALSO NEVER,NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP#1 ON 10/25/1997--PEOPLE HOLD ON-#1 ON 4/5/1997 AND THE JUNIOR VASQUEZ MIX --NEVER GONNA FALL#1 BILLBOARD CLUB CHARTS ON 12/27/1997--WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR? A CD FULL OF ENERGY AND DANCING TUNES...LISA STANSFIELD WILL ALWAYS BE A TRUE DIVA IN THE MUSIC WORLD!"
2,Bad quality,"I saw the other person's review and still decided to give it a try. But she is definitely right: it only worth $5, or maybe less! One of the baskets is already broken prior to receive and woven badly. The only thing I like is the liner, which makes the basket looks much nicer. I think it not worth to return so just keep it. But I won't buy this brand anymore."
3,Item is good as long as on super discount,"I got these for 80% off for the price I couldn't beat it. But the quality isn't good at all, the liner is fine but the basket pieces are constantly breaking off. I wanted to use these for my 12 month old's small toys in his playroom to keep on the floor for his easy access but I have to closely supervise him to be aware of pieces coming free."
1,Bad Movie,The only good thing about this movie was the guy taking a shower. But even that wasn't that hot because he was showering in his underwear. Who does that?
4,The Brotherhood 3: Young Demons,"this one is ok, if you like to get scared then you will love this dvd"
1,Brotherhood 3-Young Demons,"I was very disappointed in this installment. I liked the first 2 versions but found this dull and boring. Endless scenes of walking down corridors waiting for something to happen... Also, there was no character development so you have nothing invested in any of the roles or actors."
4,It Was both Good and Bad,"I have seen all three Brotherhood movies, and I own a copy of each. I love DeCoteau's films and understand that they are ment to be B movies from the start, thats part of the fun afterall. Actor Kristopher Turner (who played Lex) was outstanding, and deserves nothing but credit for his contribution to the movie; hopefully he will be back in some of Director DeCoteau's films.Unfortunately, this movie did have some drawbacks, most notably the long drawn out chase seens through the high school, and the lightening in the background got old after awhile too. Most of the actors did a so-so job in their roles, the worst job coming from Ramses (Lex's brother.) Despite some really bad flaws in this third take of the Brotherhood series, I still liked it."
2,Oh Brother,"A TOTAL waste of time.Unless you have absolutely nothing else to do, this film is a collossal waste of time. No scares, not even remotely scarey moments.If you have seen the BROTHERHOOD II, then this is where this trashy series gets worse.Nice settings, not a scarey film. But it has a good idea at its core.However this film is more vacuous than anything Troma could dream up."
1,Surprisingly Not Satisfied,"Unlike other Mezlan shoes I've purchased, this shoe is made of cheap leather. It was on sale from just over $200.00 to $75.00. I know why now. The Mezlan Carmichaels are far superior to these shoes. I would definitely not recommend them."
2,They don't fit any of my bottles,"I am very disappointed in this product. These nipples don't fit any of my Medela, Evenflo, Avent, or Similac bottles. Totally worthless purchase. After having ordered these, I found out that they cost less at Babies'r'us. I do not recommend this product."
1,bleh.,I was looking for the silicone fast flow but these were cheaper and on amazon prime. They weren't as fast and latex always seems dirty to me! Just not for me! Got here in great time though!
1,defective nipples,"these are the only nipples that my exclusively breast fed baby would take. i ended up purchasing a whole cartload (20 to be exact) b/c she recently was diagnosed w/ thrush and i was told to ""resterilize"" in between feedings - only latex doesn't allow for that so we use it one day and then throw it away. we were wondering why she would only take 1-2oz throughout the day at each feeding when i was at work, tho normally she downs 6-7oz. in less than 10mins, until i read the one star review here and decided to take a second look at the nipples. imagine my surprise when only 2 of the 20 indeed had a fast flow, and the rest were slow! i tried to use a needle to increase the hole but didn't really work - very disappointed since i'm pretty much tied to this product since my daughter refuses all other types. i'm going to try the silicone one with her tomorrow to see if she takes it - hoping for a miracle!"
2,Mine were defective,I ended up returning these since they were defective. I noticed that my 6 month old was eating much slower with these so I tested them. Turns out these were slower than some of my slow nipples that I already had. Typically I Playtex has fairly good products so I don't know if I just ended up with a bad batch.
4,Only nipple my baby will take,"My 6-month-old baby has been using these nipples since he was about 3 months old, and they are the only nipples he will take. They fit Playtex drop-ins or VentAire bottles. I breastfeed, and I've had no problem going between breast and bottle with these nipples. My baby much prefers the latex nipples over the silicon ones with the same shape.I gave this product 4 stars because of the eight nipples I purchased, one was faulty - very little liquid would come out."
1,Faulty Nipples,"My daughter is close to 5 months of age and we wanted to get the fast flow nipples. We placed an order for these nipples based on the excellent reviews. However, these nipples are much slower than the medium flow nipples we have. My daughter took double the time to finish up the same amount of formula. And yes, I tried a couple of times and actually felt very sorry for the little one because she had to keep trying so hard to get her food! This might have been an isolated case of manufacturing defect, but it did happen."
5,Worth the wait.,"From the two CD set of a live ""Lamb"" show in LA to the disks of other rarities and live performances this box set is everything you would expect and more. The quality of the recordings from concerts in the 70's is excellent. A simple reminder of how progressive Genesis was. Hearing Peter sing these songs live is so sweet."
4,"good, not excellent","I love Genesis, particularly with Peter Gabriel singing lead vocals.Therefore, Genesis Archive vol.1: 1967-1975 was a must have for me. The studio version of The Lamb is one of my favorite albums of all time. The live Lamb(cds 1 and 2 of this 4 cd box set box set) is just as wonderful. The beautiful, sometimes mystical, thought provoking lyrics(which were typical for all Genesis albums during the Peter Gabriel era)coupled with the amazing sounds generated by the rest of the group equal music that is simply incredible. Cd 3 contained a lot of good, old Genesis both live and studio. Cd 4 is the reason that I gave this box set 4 stars instead of 5. While it's kind of nice to hear Genesis in their embryonic phase, cd 4 could have been a lot more gratifying if more live music from the Genesis\ Gabriel era had been utilized. However, despite the shortcomings of cd 4, this box set is worth buying, especially if you can get it at a discounted price."
5,It was a great show!,"I was at the Shrine Auditorium the night this Genesis show was recorded. It was the only show of their's I ever attended but then, after Peter Gabriel left the band, I could never really see the point in going to another one. It was known throughout my circle of friends and fellow Genesis zealots that the show had been recorded and none of us could figure out why the performance was never released, not that we lost sleep over it but still... Anyway, a cultural wrong of cosmic proportions has been righted and it's a wonderful thing that this performance is at last available. It's both a fine performance and recording and not to be missed by fans of the ""real"" Genesis. If you were ever at one of their shows then you'll want it for it's ""memory candy"" value. If not, you'll still want it because it's just plain bitchen!"
5,Well worth the purchase,"Disk one and two are the complete Lamb Lies Down on Broadway concert with only the final song, IT, not orginal. Disk three has some great songs and is worth the price of admission alone. Disk four is a collection of never released and b-side songs. Very good sound quality for 1970's recording, very clean and quite. A must have for all Genesis fans."
5,Compelling Rock Theater,"Though surprising that they chose the Shrine show considering there are plenty of good recordings of The lamb lies down on Broadway, the remastering and overdubs make for a great show that reminds listeners, who are mostly hardcore fans, why this band was really something special and probably not appreciated fully by the masses. For me, DISCS 1 & 2 are why I bought this set. DISC 3 has a lot of great live material representing the great tracks from the FOXTROT and SELLING ENGLAND BY THE POUND albums. DISC 4 is from the vaults and there are many treats."
2,What a rip off !,"Well the cost of this is one issue. But if we as consumers where treated better thet the first two discs which are ""The Lamb"" Live should have been released as a stand alone. The tunes are great it is the packaging that stinks."
4,Special,"This is a treat, a very speical package with many favorites of old Genesis. My favorite is the live stuff from Selling England By The Pound tour. But the whole package is worth the price."
4,Touching film on the lives of street kids,"A variation on Hector Babenco's great 'Pixote', this follows the same themeof abandoned street kids in (in this case Morocco as opposed to Latin America),being played by real street kids.But ""Ali"" is much less gritty and naturalistic in style, if not story.Beautiful widescreen photography, some playful animated moments, and aslightly less despairing feel (although it's still pretty dark).A young street boy is killed, and his friends try to figure out how toget him properly buried, while fending off attacks from the localstreet gang, finding the boy's mother, etc.Very well acted for the most part, and has it's share of touching,heartbreaking moments. But it also feels manipulative and 'moviesh' atothers. Certainly a good film, if not quite at the amazing level of it'sancestors."
2,Fleas - not the best.,"There are two different types of Adams Flea and Tick Mist. this one is the organic version, and does not work as well as the other type. We have had a terrible flea problem this winter, and I bought this to replace the empty bottle of the non-organic version we had. I would count up to 100 dead fleas falling off our jack russell. But with this, I'm just not getting the same numbers. I would save my money and buy the really potent stuff."
3,seemed to work at first...,"i researched this product on several sites before buying and i was really hoping it would work wonders since i couldnt afford frontline for both cat and dog at the time. on first use she had pretty immediate relief and i was relieved as well. unfortunately, it hardly worked through the night. someone somewhere had stated that it deters fleas, but doesn't necessarily kill them, or vice versa, which i guess makes sense considering how cheap it was. for it to work at all it has to be used pretty much everyday and i don't think you are supposed to use it everyday. i guess if frontline is failing you, you can use this as a back up, but by itself it doesn't cut it unfortunately. plus, the smell is borderline toxic. but for 10 bucks, it's worth a shot."
4,Flea Genocide,"This stuff works pretty good better than another I tried and I even sprayed some around the house. I do think it's annoying to apply to the cat but it does work, another thing I do not like is after that the cat can't really lick itself... When it tries to it makes a funny face because of the nasty taste.. this will last for some time... But it works!"
1,Dont use!!!,"I used this spray on my sons cat as regular preventive care. It was the first time we had used this brand and the smell of the spray was very strong. After spraying the cat he was drooling very badly (though the container says this is not a cause for concern) he was very lethargic, and couldn't seem to control his bladder. Even after washing it off him with Dawn dishsoap (recommended by the vet) he has continued to fight for his life the past couple of days. We don't know if he will pull thru or not, the vet says we just have to wait and see. Please don't use this on your animals, it isn't worth the risk of killing them."
4,Ribbons West Series,I thoroughly enjoyed the series. I would recommend the series to anyone who has read Tracie Peterson in the past.
2,Keeps light out but too thick,"This mask does a good job of keeping light out, but is not for people who like to sleep on their side. The mask is so thick that you can't find a comfortable position."
4,Economical pump,"This pump works great for my 700 gallon pond with stream and waterfall. I removed the filter screen and used a 1.25"" sump hose to connect it to a larger filter. At this price I'd be happy if it only lasted a couple of years. My last Sunterra pump was a 550gph in a smaller pond and it was still running after 6 years use, at which point I sold the property."
3,Qualified approval,"Pumps well,but the filter needs to be cleaned frequently. Unfortunately, I am uncertain as to whether the filter is inadequate or whether my Koi pond just needs more filtering equipment than I currently have."
2,Won't buy again!,"My wife bought the Sunterra two pond kit for me two years ago from Costco. After I installed it, the pump froze up within 3 months. I had to run out and buy a pump from Lowe's to keep the fish alive. A call to Sunterra got me a replacement pump which did the same thing 4 months later. A second call to them resulted in another replacement pump which quit working after about a year. Their pumps are garbage made in China. Go figure! The pump I bought as an emergency answer from Lowe's is still working after more than two years. The Sunterra rep told me that they were changing pump manufacturers but never offered a third replacement."
3,Really uncomfortable.,"I was going to buy these off Amazon but happened to see them in a store. I tried them on and although they look great on, they were also uncomfortably stiff and hard. The sole is not padded at all and being so chunky my feet hurt just from walking around in them in the store. On the other hand, if your feet can take that kind of treatment, by all means get this stylish pair."
5,Great melody rock! Buy it!,"This is absolutely the best album what Andy Mccoy has made after break up of Hanoi Rocks (1980-1985, one of the greatest bands in the world. Was role model band for Guns'n Roses, Manic Street Preachers...).Great guitar solos and compositions in this album. Some people may think Andy is not the best vocalist. Maybe. But at least there is right feeling! And his beatiful girlfriend sings also here.There is 14 songs in this album. Maybe only two or three of them are not so good. Others are great or ultimate great. That kind of level is very rare."
4,Nice story,Great story line. Good read...only wish that it was a better ending....more closure. Over all really good book. A must read for any good historical read lover.
4,Good read.,This was a free book I decided to give a try and was pleasantly surprised to find it was a good read. The author did a good job with the time period and the character development. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys this type of romance and adventure.
4,A good read,"The characters are very human, fallible and damaged. Cheryl draws you in nicely, and with plenty of twists and turns she keeps you involved."
5,Sweet Serenity,basically I use this music to sleep and to relax when I've had a hard day. it is totally worth it to look into other albums as well
5,Beautiful Music to mediate to!,I received this suggestion to listen to this from a friend and it was more than I expected in really relaxing your mind.
5,SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Relaxing,"All of the Liquid Mind CDs are excellent. They can take a hectic day, week, or even a hectic moment and place you in such a serene atmosphere. You cannot go wrong in purchasing any or all of the Liquid Mind Series. I now have all of them."
5,Incredibly relaxing and peaceful,"When I'm uptight after a rough day, I can tune into this CD and become peaceful and relaxed again. Even the dog falls asleep!!! The music lulls me into a wonderful state of being, centered and at peace. This CD was recommended to me by the medium I see - he oftentimes plays it during sessions and it adds to the ambience of the moment. I find myself transported to a better state of mind through this CD. I recommend it."
5,Wonderful,What a moment of stillness and light. This work recharges your soul. Liquid Mind is one of the best.
2,UNHAPPY LISTENER,"When I purchasesd this CD judging from the cover and name: Liquid Mind V:Serenity, I thought I would be getting a relaxing collection of music, probably suitable for an infant to hear. What a mistake I made! This CD was totally disappointing. There really were no 'songs', and what sounds were emitted were barren and not pleasing to the ear."
1,Do not waste your money,"At first glance, this is a PDA but in fact the calendar is for displaying the date and time only. It is said in the box that it is compatible with several MS-Outlook but in fact it requires three transformations to synchronize the contacts agenda between the PC and the PDA. The PDF manual supplies a minimum of information abut how it operates and it is necessary to download html file from ... to find out what can be done. It looks like a PDA, but many functions are incomplete and very unfriendly. I think I have wasted my money."
2,Old time iron on,"The shirt is bright and colorful. However, the design was the old fashion heat applied graphic which requires special care and cracks very easily. I was very disappointed in this product. I was surprised that Amazon would put such a poor product in their line up."
5,Reviewing the Juan Mendoza CD,I really enjoyed this CD with Juan Mendoza. It has most of the songs that I was looking for. The sound and quality were wonderful even though the songs and music were recorded a long time ago. It sounds as if they were recorded this year. I'm very pleased with it.
3,So Loud!,"This is a sweet toy, but for something that is supposed to be a bedtime nightlight for kids, it is way too loud! Pablo sings a nice little song, but there should be a volume control."
5,awesome bedtime pal!,I got this item for a great price and my 3 yr old loves it and takes it to bed with him every night. Great buy for the money.
1,Don't buy it unless you have glue!,"Product arrived quickly but 1/2 of the stones were laying in the bottom of the bag. Contacted company and they issued me a credit for the full purchase price and shipping. We glued the stones on and it is OK, but it's not what I'd call a high quality product."
4,Pink Rubberized Crystal Cover,This is the second time I have purchased this product. The rubberized feel is nice when holding the phone. The only bad thing about it is that over time the coating starts to come off in little pieces. The little diamonds are very sparkly and cute. I would still recommend this product to someone.
3,No mounting tabs....,Got this item and there weren't any mounting tabes that mount to the factory locations for the radio. Fashioned some out of an old set of brackets I had laying around the garage...Other then that...it is what it is...Wish I would have gone with the flat panel version instead of the one that has the bump-out.
4,Focused On Riding,This book was a pleasure to read is the type of book for the good and keen equestrian. Having trained with the authors the book opens up a new door to the equestrian sport as well as an instuctional learning device. This book deserves the whole 4 stars
4,Grows on me with each listen,"I put off buying this CD for a very long time. Wanted an album with Pape that was more than just one or two tracks, so finally bought it. Agree with paolo that it sounds like Berg orchestrated by Mahler. It also sounds like 'early Schoenberg' (Verklarte Nacht). I am grateful it doesn't sound anything like I would expect Rammstein to sound. It took a number of listens (maybe 10) to get where I really liked it. At the moment I don't want to listen to anything else. Rene Pape does not disappoint."
2,Not Quite What I Thought It Would Be...,"I am a huge Rammstein fan. I have all of their albums and I gladly support them. When I heard about this tribute or compilation, I had an image in my mind of what I hoped it would be. I have bought other tribute albums to bands such as, The String Tribute to Tool, and I enjoyed that very much because it stayed to the notes and almost direct parallel to the music itself. This album, Mein Herz Brennt, disappointed me. I thought it would be a classical approach to Rammstein, staying with the notes and almost exact parallel to their songs. The female vocalist does not fit for their songs. You can also barely hear the music over the vocals. It was a great try by the composer, but it just doesn't sound right. I don't recommend this album for any Rammstein fan, unless they really want to dish out +$30 to be disappointed."
1,Not very good,The first is definately the best. This book was horrible. I didn't care that much for the first and I was anxiously awaiting this second part. The ending to this one was terrible. It was pointless and very unrealistic.
5,The Best Friend 2-The Best Book Too!,"Even though I didn't read The Best Friend, I got the picture. The Best Friend 2 was the first Fear Street I had ever read. Now I'm hooked on Fear Street! The book was kinda confusing. But it was the best (my opinion)! Thank you R.L. Stine for your bloody, exciting, suspenseful, and frightning series!"
2,Not as good as the first!,"I really liked the original Best Friend and I love Fear Street books, but this book just didn't cut it. It definitely didnt scare me and at first, the plot seemed very predictable, but then I got confused when Honey was Becca.. and Becca was Honey.. very confusing. I read that R.L. Stine had a contest to see which reader's idea for this book he liked best. Well, he should've just used his own magic on this. A CHEAP, UNREADABLE STORY. PLEASE, DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY."
2,Pretty Much A Disappointment,"I didn't like this sequel very much. The first one was much better; R.L. Stine should have left it alone. The first part was ok and pretty creepy, but after that it turned out like most of the other Fear Street books: predictable, boring, a little too gory and hardly scary. I won't tell you the ending, but it follows the typical Fear Street theme: It's always the person you least suspect. You can write to me and complain or send me death threats, I don't care. I just didn't like this book."
3,Not a good book,This book is kinda confusing when Honey is Becka in the beggining. I also didn't get at the end...how did lilah know to call the police? I also didn't get why Trish was so mad everyone knows Honey did it! She was uninvited and she pushed her down the stairs. This Fear Street Book doesn't cut it....i think RL stine can do better
4,R.L.Stine if you're reading this...,"Then I think it's awesome how you had a contest like this one, letting young readers such as myself use their imaginations and actually have a shot at writing a book worthy of being on the same shelf as your other masterpieces! I think this book was good considering you didn't write it! I mean, a lot of people didn't like this book because they were expecting something as original and creative as your first one and like all your other amazing stories. But I, for one, think that this book was good overall. Very different. I love all your books, I've read almost all of them--My mother won't buy me anymore at the moment because she says I have to finish the ones I have first--and they're all excellent! Cheers to you! I recommend this book!"
3,The first one was WAY BETTER!!,"This was not what I expected. The start of it was odd, but when it came to the part that it was actually Honey pretending to be Becka, then it became interesting, but as it went on, it just didnt make sense. It was cool to know the actual story behind Honey and why she went after Becka in the first place.The part about Trish just was abit too bizarre. The ending sucked BADLY!!! R.L. Stine must have either wrote this book in a matter of days or was just having a bad day. Eek."
3,Pretty cool,"I liked finding out what really happened between Becka and Honey, and finding out what happened to make Honey a psycho. Overall, it was pretty cool."
4,Great,"I liked this book, but I think that they kill to many people. Also in the first one you were more anxious to know the end. I really enjoyed this book"
4,"""Gently"" definitely is a keeper","My first reaction to it was mild disappointment (except for immediate favorable reactions towards ""Some Cats Know"" and ""Does He Love You?""). I had never heard Liza's voice quite so, well, ""throaty."" However, after seeing her perform this material in concert, the CD began to grow on me. She really does adapt a different singing style--it's a kick to see her segue from her belting numbers like ""Some People"" into the ""Gently"" stuff. Now this disc is one of my favorites. I agree with the poster who sez she should have taken home Grammy for this project; I believe that year was the last Grammy lumped both male and female pop vocalists into one category (Tony Bennett beat her out for the trophy)."
3,Decent covers but not her best effort,"Great song selection but the album's concept seems a bit disjointed. There were a few treats for the audiophile, though. She sings a duet with Johnny Mathis which opens the disc. Great opener.A huge surprise and decent remake is her duet with Donna Summer on ""Does He Love You."" Actually, the remake of this originally country songs is quite good, giving it new life. You almost fell the passion within both singers and the struggle betweeen the two of them.The Donna Summer duet was the only reason for my buying this CD and I don't regret it at all.I would suggest that you buy this CD with reservations."
3,DONNA SUMMER BLOWS LIZA AWAY!!!!!!!!!,ALL THREE STARS ARE FOR 'DOES HE LOVE YOU' THE ONLY SONG WORTH HEARING MORE THAN ONCE ON THIS WONDERFUL DIVA'S ALBUM. DONNA SOUNDS BETTER THAN EVER AND COMPLETLY STEALS THE SONG. LIZA NEEDS TO GET BACK WITH THE PET SHOP BOYS FOR ANOTHER ALBUM. THEY UNDERSTAND DIVA.
1,looks nice but non-functioning,I liked the visual appearance of the timer. I liked the magnetic back. But the alarm occasionally rings when I set it. I can't count on it to actually ring. I went out of my way to get after seeing it at a friend's house. And it doesn't even work!
1,"poorly designed, poorly made, just bad","we received this timer as a wedding gift. after using for a week or so the timer stopped working when hanging on the refrigerator. however, we found that it would still work when sitting on the counter... so we used it like that for about a year, just couldn't stand the idea of throwing it away...then finally a tiny plastic piece that holds it together broke...don't buy this item. it is poorly designed and poorly made."
1,"looks nice, performs poorly","magnet falls off pretty quickly, and the timer itself starts to wear pretty quickly as well, soon you have to turn past 15 minutes to start and it rings at weird times."
2,Broke after a short while...,"like the other reviewer, I loved the design and the fact that I could attach it to my magnetic knife holder on my wall. As soon as I took it out of its package my kids got a hold of it, dropped it, and the plastic piece holding together the two halves of the timer cracked. I kept using it, very very cautiously for a few more months until it broke completely. Very cheeply made."
4,definitly the queens of noise!,"This album was released in 1976,yet it still sounds as fresh as when i first got this on 8-track!!!..This release was panned because of Kim Fowleys presentation of them as sex objects and not as serious musicians!...""Cherry Bomb""still ROCKS!!. SO much so, that Joan Jett resurrected it for glorious result for a misspent youth and Cherie and Marie Currie did the same on one of there releases!!..The CD is sonically glorious!!my favorite track is the longest track..""Dead End Justice""...I waited for this to be released for soooo long!!!..and i am truly estatic that all there music has been released on CD!!..it's about time!!next purchase??..QUEENS OF NOISE!!.."
4,Nostalgic Music,"I don't want to date myself, but when I was in high school, the Runaways were so cool! These hot chicks playing Rock-N-Roll! I had this album on vinyl & wanted to duplicate it on CD. An excellent example of mid-70's Rock!"
5,ONE OF THE GREATEST ALBUMS EVER MADE,I HAD THIS ALBUM ON VINYL WHEN I WAS A YOUNGER MAN I LOVED IT THEN AND STILL LOVE IT TODAY THE RUNAWAYS WERE A GREAT BAND AND WERE AHEAD OF THEIR TIME IT IS A SHAME THEY DIDNT LAST MY ADVICE TO ANYONE WHO LIKES STRAIGHT TO THE POINT HARD ROCK GET THIS ALBUM THEY TOLD IT HOW IT WAS.
5,Comfortable Racing Seat,Great product intalled pretty easy in my 92' camaro just had to cut a small slit in it to make it fit but fit really well. There really comfortable to especially cause I have a bad back.
4,Still Scary After All These Years,"""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" is the science fiction tale that has inspired at least three movies. It explores the classic paranoid thought that everybody else is not what they seem and takes it to the ultimate paranoid conclusion: they're all out to get you.Parts of the book have become a little dated (doctors make house calls, operators still get on the line with people making phone calls), but this is not science fiction that relies on gizmos and technology. This book is driven by the terror of friends and neighbors being replaced by emotionless pod people. I can think of very few science fiction novels from the 1950s that have held up this well.Fifty years later ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" is still a fast-paced, interesting read. And just so you know, none of the movies ends quite like the original story."
5,Always works for me,Not sure I understand why but each time I read this book great things happen to me. If you are open minded with some faith it may help you too.
5,Gratitude for what you have is the master key of prosperity,"According to Fillmore, the Divine is always ready to give. It has no choice in the matter; it must give, for that is its nature. It is ever the same, constant, abundant, freely circulating and available. Turn the great energy of your thinking toward ""plenty:"" ideas, and you will have plenty, regardless of what men about you are saying or doing. The Divine is persuaded and directed by intelligence. If you find yourself low of funds, Fillmore says, praise and bless whatever you have and imagine it growing larger. Talk only of prosperity and it will become your reality. Don't simply ask God for riches. Instead, like Solomon, the richest man of his age, ask for wisdom, for ideas. There is something very comforting and inspiring about Prosperity. It is the book to read when you feel overwhelmed by your financial problems, as it shows you that ultimately, the source of all wealth is immaterial.[...]"
1,Please don't get involved in a Cult.,"This is one of the manuscripts for a cult. Please do not get involved. If you do not think it is a cult please do the following to find out: 1. Pray, 2. Read your Bible 3. Ask other people. Take care and may God lead you to the truth."
5,Prosperity by charles Fillmore,I have heard of this author but never read his work before.This book is great. It is loaded with information that is of value because it deals with the moral values in our lives as much as giving fundamental guidelines to work towards prosperity. I believe he wrote the book from his own inner knowledge and experience.
4,A Quiet Force,"The fourth full-length release from this little-known Norvegian outfit defies attempts at categorization once again. It seemed very straightforward at first and almost a regression from their previous record (""A Blessing In Disguise""), but it has grown on me a lot since then. There is quite a bit of delightful complexity hiding under the seemingly prosaic riffs and catchy choruses. Not in the same league as ""Light Of Day, Day Of Darkness"", but realistically, that was a once-in-a-lifetime album, and trying to recreate it would be pointless. ""Green Carnation"" is moving on and growing, I'm so glad their music makes it to the States, maybe they can play ProgPower one of these days. Major props to Jim Raggi and LOTFP for exposing this band to US listeners."
2,Wrong MP3 version?,"From the cover, it looks like the MP3 version is the movie soundtrack, which you should avoid at all costs, in favor of either the original Broadway cast album or the 1996 Nathan Lane revival."
1,Wrong Book Sent,"Amazon sent us issue #7 instead of #2, which broke my little girl's heart. We had to return the book and buy the correct copy from e-bay."
2,Hardcover edition a horrible buy.,"The hardcover edition of this dictionary is awful. The binding is originally constructed, with tight pages that cracked my edition beyond repair on the second day.The dictionary itself is exceptionally good, making for easy reference. A paperback edition would be ideal.This dictionary is also mediocre for referencing technical terms."
5,Fabulous Fables,"Delightful,tuneful,charming.You don't have to be a kid to love these Fables.But if you are, you'll have a great listening time. Let your folks enjoy them too.Consider this a rave."
5,TOP OF THE HEAP,"This is a must if you want to hear the best of ""Jerry Herman"".The score is so unbelievablely fantastic that even with aflawed ""book"" is something, once heard you want to see, whetherstaged as a concert or the complete musical. The songs provethat ""Jerry Herman"", like ""Irving Berlin"" have been blamed forwriting simply songs, easily written. This show proves criticswrong...........and if songs being memorable is a bad thing,lets hear more! A Masterpiece!"
5,lucky,"I picked up this book at my local library for no particular reason. I'd never read a war memoir before, but I had taught English in China. This was an extremely well written book, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in China, WWII, the life of a spy, or a good story.I came in with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised."
2,A letdown,"I was very excited to read this book on the plane to Beijing, but it was a big letdown. I have great respect for all who served the U.S. in the military, but as an exciting wartime spy book, Journey to Peking, is not very interesting. Also, the author portrays the Chinese he comes in contact with as shallow fools, and that got old for me real quick."
4,It's all about style,"I bought this set because of the stainless steel interior and aluminum core. Now, as I use these pots I realize I love how the handles feel, and how nice they look. The pots conduct heat well, and look great."
3,disappointed,"After throwing away teflon pans and missing the control of a gas range, I decided to buy a nice set of pans. I have had my multiclad for about three months and am disappointed. The insides of the pans scratch so easily. I try to use bamboo stirrers primarily but the insides are still scratched up already. They are also hard to clean. They get a film on them even after scrubbing. However, my biggest disapointment is in their conduction. I don't notice they cook any better than the cheap pans I had before. Initially I liked the pans, I even gave one as a gift. Now I wished I wouldn't have. I would rather have a new set of Revereware. They don't scratch inside, are dishwasher safe, I find them easier to clean as you can use tougher abrasives, conduct heat just as well, and would have saved me a bundle of money. I would have gladly spent more money on a set that would have met my expectations."
5,A treasure trove of musical gems from Estonia,"I especially enjoyed the works by Lemba, Eller and Raid. The Lemba symphony is of a Brahmsian character, warm and lyrical and full of interesting musical ideas. The symphony by Raid is quite striking and original in its design, having the same rugged, bracing, outdoorsy feel you get in the music of E. J. Moeran and Jan Sibelius. I am surprised this composer is not better known. The opening movement of Heino Eller's Five Pieces is drop dead gorgeous, with lush string writing and the same plaintive, wistful harmonic language you find in Grieg. You won't be disappointed with this treasure trove of Estonian gems!"
4,A pleasant discovery,This is a small treasury of music that's not played often --beautiful melodies from seldom heard composers.
5,My ALL TIME favorite Christie...,"Among those 75 novels of Christie that I've read, this is surely my ALL TIME FAVORITE. The Egypt background was absolutely appealing. And the plot was engaging till the end. Even if you're such a big fan of Poirot and Miss Marple, don't you dare miss this one. It would bring you to such a different world, where the devil lies within the beauty."
4,Egyptian Mystery,This different from most of Agatha Christie's mysteries. It starts off a little slow. It was worth it once the first murder occurs.
3,Average.,"This was a light and enjoyable read. However, it seemed to be populated by a cast of Englishmen who just happened to be living in Ancient Egypt. I feel that it could have been much more interesting if Ms. Christie had made the effort to create more believable characters."
2,Not her best,"This book allows Christie to draw on her considerable archaeological knowledge based on her experiences on digs with her archaeologist (second) husband. The setting is an intriguing change from her usual. However, I found the plotting in this one to be a little thin. I rarely figure out Christie's culprits in advance, but I saw right through this one. Read it for an interesting change of pace, but don't expect to be deceived."
1,Not worth a listen,"It's wrong. The British accent in the Egyptian setting doesn't work. The story is long and tedious. The protagonist learns nothing during the entire book and in the end it all has to be explained to her, like a child. I am sorry I purchased this item, and the reviews I glanced at made it sound so intriguing. In fact, it is dull. I am a HUGE Christie fan, and I'd say she deserves a miss once in a while. This is a big miss."
5,Excellent respirator/mask!,"This works as advertised! I used it to filter greenhouse pollen and it kept my allergies from blowing up and the respirator made me able to tolerate being in a hot greenhouse with a mask on! When I run out, I will buy more. The company I purchased it from got it to me very quickly, as well."
5,The Wild Berry Book is the book to buy! A+++,If you are looking for a book to buy that has great color and depth in each picture and you really want to know what berries your about to pick if they are poison or not......this is the book to buy.....it's not like a lot of books that have pencil sketches of a berry...what a joke those are when so many berries look a like! This book is GREAT! You won't be sorry!Thank you Lee's Books in St. Paul MN for such a beautiful book and fast order!
3,"Disappointing, bland P&P music","With all the great dance music in the BBC's fabulous production of P&P, you'd think this would be a great CD. Unfortunately, and suprisingly, none of the dance music is included! Instead, the entire CD is the background music used throughout the series which, after a very little while, all sounds pretty much the same. This is very tame, fairly bland fare -- may be OK as background music for a tea party, but otherwise not worth the effort, or price."
4,Beautifully composed music but very similar,"When watching the movie, the music sets the mood perfectly, the piano is excellent in both the movie and the cd. What I found though, if you listen to the cd, many songs sound the same, well renditions of one of the main themes. I was disappointed with the piano summarys, because it cut out most of the songs for that portion of the movie--such as piano summary for chapter 3, where Darcy and Eliza danced, there is about a 10 second ""summary"" of it and only with piano, though it was so beautifully done in the movie. The music is perfect though for when you don't have the movie and crave to see it, you can recall many scenes from the cd, and it is nice to listen to when doing something else.Be careful when buying it, because it is an import and costs more, though it is a really nice cd, it can get extremely repetitive."
4,A great delight-almost,"Like all the reviewers, I too was ecstatic when I received this CD in the mail. I listened to it that very day, and I loved it. But I was disappointed when some of the score from the film was not on the CD, like ""Mr. Beveridge's Maggot"" (the scene where Darcy and Lizzy dance) and ""Grimstock."" These are important pieces, and I wished they had been included. Nevertheless, this CD is still wonderful, and a definite must for Jane Austen fans everywhere."
3,"Pleasant, but somewhat lacking.","This is a pleasant soundtrack, but I was very disappointed in the ""dance montage"". I was expecting to hear all of the dance music, including (especially) the tune that Darcy and Miss Bennet danced to. However, that particular track was less than a minute of okay music. It wasn't my favorite. If I want to hear all the dance music, I guess I can watch the DVD."
4,Just what I wanted!,"I am very pleased with this soundtrack, the music is beautiful. The reason I gave it a 4 is because it is somewhat repetative."
5,"A ""Must Have"" for P & P Lovers","If you watch Pride & Prejudice and love music, you really need to have this CD. It is so beautifully done. It will bring back every memory of every scene. Remember when Mr. Darcy studies Elizabeth with that loving look in his eyes at Pemberly while she plays the piano with his sister? When you hear the music, you will get goose bumps as it brings back that memory to you. I highly recommend this CD to all P & P lovers."
5,Worthy of Austen!,"The music was a perfect accompaniment to the wonderful screenplay of this production of Jane Austen's most popular and well-known novel. Listening to the samples made me get out my set of the videos of the A&E production and view the entire production for the millionth time. Thanks, Amazon, for this great feature on your site."
4,"A bit cyclic, but still pleasant",The music is very inviting and smooth. But I cannot help but feel a bit sick of that same piano tune that is randomly thrown in throughout the playlist. I would have liked more variety. Still a wonderful buy for those who loved the miniseries.
5,I can never get enough.,"I absolutely loved the A&E version of Pride and Prejudice. So I was so happy to get this CD. And as I expected, it's great! Starting, of course, with Colin Firth on the cover. The music is a variety of moods. And the CD has 24 tracks! I love it."
2,Expected more,The book is not very visual except for the quiz at the end of five chapters. More radiograph figures adjacent to descriptions are needed. It doesn't help that the cost of the book was dropped by $17 after I bought it. Also there's no Index.
5,Heaven,"This garlicky salami is the best salami I've ever had. Tangy, succulent, GARLICKY, peppery.Item arrived quickly, was packaged well, and was of good quality.I will definitely be using this vendor again with no reservations."
2,manufacturer seems skimpy,"the product is good, material is good, but the manufacturer tried to save by making cylinder blocks by cutting holes in rectangular ( cuboid ) blocks. In other words most rectangular blocks have holes in them.nonetheless, my kids love it... does not hurt if they hurl 'em at others.2nd issue is that the number of blocks are a little less.. 20 more would have been worth the price."
2,Good AM - Bad FM,"The FM tuner is pretty insensitive, but the sound quality is OK if you live near a strong FM signal.However, the AM tuner is quite good.Unfortunately, I'm primarily an FM fan and will be looking for another radio.ALso, after owning this for about 3 months, there appears to be a short in the headphone cord."
3,Good but minor annoyances.,"Very directional reception on weaker stations - if you turn a corner, the sound fades. Tuning/memory buttons are over sensitive. Too easy to actuate by accidental movement when walking or jogging. Can be very annoying to have to stop and reset. But on the whole I've had a lot of good use from it."
1,complete garbage,Radio worked great for a couple weeks and then stopped working all together. Minimal use at office and it is already broken. This is a complete waste of money.
1,bad product,I bought one of these to listen to the baseball games while at work. It quit working after about 2 weeks. Not good quality!
4,A nice little radio for the money.,"I got this radio to use while riding my bike. I wanted something small with an electronic tuner so I wouldn't have to worry about bumping it and losing the station.The radio is very compact and fits nicely in my jacket pocket. The tuner is easy to use and well laid out. It allows you to set presets for am/fm and easily move through them with a single button press.The reception is pretty good, and keeps most stations tuned in even while riding at 60 mph. I would have liked to have a bass boost option on it, but even without it the sounds is acceptable."
2,"Good for beginners, but nothing more...","This book did not provide me with the information that I wanted. There were no scales given, just examples to play along with. For those looking to get into slide, I'd recommend Fretboard roadmaps, simply because it offers so much more, like scales, thorough explanations of examples and practice tracks to improvise with. Bottom line, skip this book and go straight for Fretboard roadmaps."
3,"Phelps is amazing, but this is his poorest effort","The first Phelps solo cd was amazing in a mid tempo, somber rock way, and the 2nd Phelps solo cd was amazing in an orchestrated way, but this one falls flat with bad production. Buy one of his first 2 cds or Libertine by Silkworm to hear Joel's best work. He's a master of the sad, melodramatic, belted out vocal, though it doesn't show here."
1,Loved it until it broke!,"The camera worked fine for 3 months, then I could not get the pics into my PC. The problem is the cameras' USB cable port or some internal connector issue. After 90 days you have a PARTS ONLY WARRANTY. Labor costs $90 (plus S&H). My palmcorder also broke recently ($200.00) so I am now finished with Panasonic. Good features,but low manufacturing quality."
4,Very nice bargain at 2012 prices,"For what this camera is selling for on the used market it's a bargain. It is simple to use, takes good pictures, has a lithium battery, uses an SD card and these are all things positive.On the so so side I find the view finder off to the left awkward but could get used to it especially if you are left eye dominant. The camera body is a little on the small side which gives you about a two finger grip. My other Pani is the FZ47which has room for a three fingered grip and it has a center mounted viewfinder.If you can't afford the FZ47 then this is a good value on the used market. Or if you want a smaller version then this is agood choice.Recommended"
4,It is a funny book.,Freckle Juice By:Judy BlumeThis book is about a boy named Andrew who wants freckles like his friend Nicky he counted them and he has 86 of them but all Andrew had was to warts.Than a few days later a girl in his class named Sharon said I hear you want Freckles I have a secret Recipe for Freckle Juice. But Sharon said only if you give me 50Cents and that was a hole week of allowance. So the next day they switched it said . If you want to find out what the Recipe said Read Freckle Juice. By Richard
3,Freckle Juice,"Freckle Juice by Judy Blume is a good book. It is about a boy named Andrew who wanted freckles like Nicky a kid in his class. A girl named Sharon said ""I have a secret recipe, but it costs 50 cents"". That is Andrew's allowance for 5 weeks. When Andrew got to school he got it and then he ran home to read it. It said to put in vinegar, mustard, olive oil, and more. I hope you like the book as I did that is why I gave it 3 stars.The EndKelly Hubbard"
4,Recipe for Freckles,"Andrew wants freckles like Nicky Lane--especially around his neck and ears--so his mom can't tell if he needs to wash or not. But even though Nicky tells him he has to be born with them, he believes smart-aleck Sharon who has a secret recipe for getting freckles--for fifty cents. Well, Andrew can't resist this offer. And so starts his freckle-getting adventure.The Creative Teacher: Activities for Language Arts (Grades 4 through 8 and Up)"
3,freckley,"This book was kind of cute, but there was nothing really outstanding about it. It would be good for a kid who didn't like his mother washing and inspecting his face."
3,good book,"My daughter suggested I get this book. She had read it as a child and remembered how much she liked this author. I was disappointed in the presentation. I was expecting a hard back book and this was paper. It seemed ""cheap"" in appearance. However, my grandson liked it and that is all that really matters. Thank you."
5,Freckle Juice,"Freckle Juice was a great book to read.I enjoyed reading this book because I like funny books.My brother and mother loved this book because it was a very creative book.My dad has never read this book.I want to read this book agian because I love this book so much I would want to read a gazillion times more!!One day I might have freckles.Some of my friends have them.I hope I get to write a story about freckles.THE ENDBy:Emily DeRouen Lake Charles,LA8 years old"
5,The greatest book in the whole world!,I think it was really good because Andrew didn't even have to put the recipe in his pocket.I hope other children read this book because it was halaryuse!Nicky has tons of freckles but Andrew wants the same amount as Nicky.Andrew want's freckles because he doesn't want to wash his neck every morning and be late for school.This is my favorite book!
4,Freckle Juice,"Did you ever want something you couldn&#65533;t have? Andrew Marcus, an elementary school student, wants freckles but he can&#65533;t get them. Andrew is a main character in the book called Freckle Juice written by Judy Blume.Freckle Juice was a funny book. It just shows how far someone will go for something they want. Something you really envy about someone else they may not want for themselves. Judy Blume puts it good on paper. You should like yourself for who you are. This is a must read book.Judy Blume has written many novels. Besides many number one bestsellers her work has been translated into twenty-something languages. Judy has inspired many young readers. She is hardworking and her work proves that."
4,Freckle Juice,Cute book for my 8 yr old granddaughter.Very fast reading.Judy Blume is a great childrens writer. We look forward toreading her books
4,"Crisp , very interesting, great plots, gr8 language","This is a great collection of short stories, snapshots of lives of ordinary, but of course unique people struggling to move forward in life. The use of language is masterful. Although I am not a writer, I am somehow envious of Cohen for the clarity and color of his wit and writing.I really liked this book and plan to buy Cohen's other books."
1,not what i expected,"This was recieved very quickly, but appeared to be bigger then what i was online. Dont be fooled this cookie cutter cuts cookies aboit the size of a quarter. I would not have purchased this item had I known it was this small."
4,Doggie Biscuits for our Pups,Actually made doggie biscuits using spent grain after making a homebrew. They are the perfect size for our dachshunds but because of the size you have to cut a LOT to get a batch of treats!
3,alright.,"This product was alright for what it is, unfortunately I ordered the big one and recieved the small one. Returning it for the 0.99 wasnt worth it. So i found one at a store instead. Thanks anyway."
1,Not as shown,"This product's picture was bigger than the actual product! It says cookie cutter, so I figured it would bee the size of an actual normal cookie! No dimensions were listed and the pic looked actual size, but really the product is the size of half my finger!...and I have small fingers! Not even bite sized cookies, so they came out not even shaped like a bone and looked like a mis-shapened squiggle! Not cool"
4,Dog bone,This is Great for making my own dog treats. Could be a bit bigger though. My dog appreciates me buying it!
1,"BUYER BEWARE!! ""R"" Rated version cuts 10 minutes","Extremely disappointed. The DVD I received was a terribly hacked/edited version of the original. It's 10 minutes shorter (1:24 vs 1:34). It was obvious from the opening shower scene that this ""version"" was horribly edited. This is simply NOT the type of film that plays well when the sexploitative parts have been removed, since it's essentially a sexploitative genre film to begin with."
1,Ilsa The Wicked Warden,I expected to see the original version (uncut). Instead I got a watered down version of a great movie. Tell me how to order to the original uncut version and you will have a satisfied customer.
2,seems to be edited version,as some other reviewers have said the cheesey flix versions of the ilsa series are edited i personaly own she wolf of the ss wicked warden and harem keeper of the oil sheiks put out by anchor bay witch are uncut and also have the star dyanne thorne doing commentary for all 3 movies you're better off getting those instead although on amazon they seem over priced
3,This is disturbing???,"Really give this 2.5 stars, Only 3 for Ilsa's impressive set of...well, you know. I read a number of reviews prior to viewing this as to being rather disturbing (i.e., violence, rape, cannibalism). The film I saw from Cheezy Flicks must have been edited. The most disturbing scene in this movie is when Ilsa gets the girls together w/a bunch of horny convicts for a little non-consensual party, however, it was not really all that disturbing, the camera never stayed in one spot and you do not see much of anything. Definitely not like ""I Spit On Your Grave, ""Last House On the Left"" or the original ""Straw Dogs"". The violence was more suggestive than graphic. The cannibalism was lame (consisting of stock footage(probably stolen from ""Wild Kingdom"")of lions and/or tigers eating their animal prey). On the plus side, there is a lot of nudity. And Ilsa, being the deviant she is, is quite hot."
3,Want to shock friends and family? Show them these.,"The Ilsa series is pure schlock and shock cinema. PLOT SUMMARY FOR ALL 3 MOVIES: Ilsa is always an evil warden in charge of abused, naked woman in a harem, Nazi death camp or secret prison. Lots of nudity and perverted torture scenes fill each movie. She Wolf Of The SS is the sickest of the 3 films. Not much to get worked up about (unless watching women boiled alive, tortured with an electric vibrator or men being (...) is your thing). WIcked Warden is a bit (...) as it mostly involves lesbians wrestling in the shower and sexually tormenting each other. Harem Keeper is more of the same. Hope this review helps you decide if this box set is for you."
3,WELL DONE YUCK,"Ho boy, what to say about this? I admit to viewing this and the original Ilse movie out of curiosity...well, my curiosity has been satisfied. Of the two movies, this one is more everything. It's sexier, it has much more girl/girl doings, and it has longer sickening torture scenes in it. And the gross out ending should satisfy all who enjoy such things. The scary part is the fact that this is clearly meant to be entertainment, and that there are people who will be entertained by it.I would dearly like to give this a one star rating...goodness knows I'm not likely to be recommending it to anyone. I even hesitate to let anyone know I've seen it. However, I am not one to pass moral judgments. Privately, I feel this movie should never have been made, but I don't have the right to decide what other people are able to see. So, I will allow it three stars, but with the warning to all that this is absolutely a gross out cult film."
2,I wish I hadn't bought this...,"... I wish I'd just rented it instead. It started out kind of erotic, but got gruesome toward the end --- and I mean REALLY GRUESOME!!! I like women-in-prison flicks, but only for the eroticism. This one wasn't really erotic. It was just bad."
4,hte best of series,"this is another of the women in prison videos ,with a ton of nudity not much plot ,but out of all the illsa videos ,if you dont get a laugh ,or so out of this one ,you must be dead"
2,Even as an exploitation film it failed,"Theres not much good to say about ""Ilsa the Wicked Warden""even Dyanna Thorne is awful in it, instead of showing herbeautiful blond hair, Jess Franco in all his absurdity diesit read, and turns the movie into one of these 70'sporn like black exploitations film where all the girls aretaking hot showers and doing each other. Now dont get mewrong, most people will watch that, but the rest of thefilm is a bit of a mess.There is some inguenity at the beginning, we see a girlescaping a guard, and we get a wild goose chase buteventually she is caught and thrown into the tortureprison system where Ilsa (Thorne).The ending though while laughable is typical of a Francofilm where the harassing abusing enemy gets eaten to shreds.Even for Ilsa fans though, the movie is a disappointment."
5,Great baroque albumAAA+++,This is a must buy if you like classical music.Has the hard too find op (la follia) on this 2 cd set.
2,Careful with this stuff,"Although Speedstick is a trusted brand it has given me severe rashes everytime I use it. I thought musk was a safe sent to use and for a while my body could handle that specific formula but when I changed to a different scent of deoderant my skin became discolored, irritated and broken. Even when the slightest amount is applied it stings my skin. I no longer use this product for such reason."
1,This CD Is Wack To The Ultimate Max!,"Maaann! How can anybody give this CD more than one star? It actually deserves ZERO stars. The Sugababes cut and paste material from other artists and try to pass it on for their own. Adina Howard came out with ""Freak Like Me"" in 1995 and the Sugababes' remake of it was atrocious. ""Blue"" sounds too similiar to Aaliyah's song ""What If."" C'mon now! Y'all need to stop playing! Heaven forbid these wenches torture the United States with even more terrible music! They're not original and their vocals are generic. If you listen to the Sugababes, be sure that you'll get diabetes. Hooollllaaa!"
3,Intriguing concept album,"Of course, not all the songs are perfect, but the casting of Linda Eder as Marguerite was. She makes as charismatic a leading lady here as she did on the Jekyll and Hyde albums. I'm glad that the casting of Percy and Chauvelin changed, because, although the performers had great voices (particularly Chuck Wagner), they didn't seem to fit their roles. The early stage of this highly entertaining musical is fun to listen to, if only to see the development of the piece as the composers went along. There are a few tracks on here that I prefer to the later Broadway versions, most notably the title song. The orchestration of ""Into the Fire"" is more stirring, too, especially the ending."
5,My absolute favorite CD of the moment!!!,"I bought both the concept and the OBC version at the same time because I listened through the headphones at the store and knew immediately that I liked some things better about each one of them. Since listening to them both many, many times - I love going on record (no pun) saying that my FAVORITE is the Linda Eder recording. Somehow it speaks more clearly to my heart (and weakens me in the knees). I love the theater, but especially musicals and this is my FAVORITE of the moment. I will be seeing the Broadway show in June and I'm sure I will love it, but I will miss ""There Never Was a Time."""
2,A Good Concept in Need of Refinement,"It's a good thing changes were made to the score of ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" before it opened on Broadway. The concept recording has its moments, but overall there's not much worth listening to. Chuck Wagner is in great voice, though he is not foppish enough to play Percy. Linda Eder, a stellar singer, is unable to convince the listener that she is doing anything other than signing -- there is no emotion or depth to her performance. Her French in ""Storybook"" is particularly bad. Dave Clemmons is also disappointing as Chauvelin, and Peabo Bryson's duet with Ms. Eder would be more at home on the Top 40 List (which it acyually made)."
5,It's a keeper,"This recording is incredible. I do not own the OSV but I know it's can't possibly be beter than this one. The entire cast is remarkable. Linda has a beautiful voice and I never tier of hearing it. Chuck Wagner is just phenomenal. He has the amazing ability to make you feel so many emotions with his beautiful voice. The song ""Into the Fire"" really shows his incredible talents. This is definitely a CD not to miss!"
4,A sane opinion,"The reviews you will generally see of this CD will compare it to the OBC. These reviewers will swear by the OBC and how ideal the cast was... Poppycock. This CD is better for several reasons. First of all, Doug Sills (the broadway Percy) is a great performer and all but he is about one tenth the singer that Chuck Wagner is. Moreover, this CD benefits from the presence of Dave Clemmons, a veteran musical star. The one thing that is annoying about this recording is the presence of Linda ""Streisand"" Eder. Since the original concept album was completely dominated by her, her usually grating immitation of Babs can become a real headache."
1,What became of Terrence V. Mann?,"This was my first musical adventure with the Scarlet Pimpernel - hadn't even heard any of the music prior to this year. The quality of the CD is excellent, the style of music (especially Marguerite's) unexpected - and the absence of Terrence Mann in the role of Chauvelin exceedingly disappointing. The actor who replaces him is perfect, just not the one I'd been hoping for. With CDs (including ""The Scarlet Pimpernel: Encore"") readily available - why aren't there any existing videos or DVDs of it available? As a Pimpernel novel/movie?now CD fan ever since high schoolFrench classes, I'd like to see how a musical handled the action!"
4,Highly readable - reviewed by Danita Switzer,"Don't be intimidated by the subject matter. Harmon's style of writing is straightforward, clear, and accessible. I found many of his ideas extremely unique. I recommend this!"
4,I wonder why she's not more popular than she is!,"An excellent novel about the coming of age of 3 children and their destinies. Although the plot is not entirely unique, Ms. Wurts has a knack of vividly portraying her characters that makes us love them. This is even more evident in her more recent series, the Wars of Light and Shadow. In any case, the adventures of Jaric and Taen inspire hope and keep us in suspense, and this remarkably talented author manages to create a world without too much of the dreary detail that encumbers many other epic fantasies. A fresh and vivid tale that inspires the imagination. (Ms. Wurts' apparent fondness of the ocean is rather a distinguishing trait of her works, don't you think?)."
4,"Compelling, original Story","Excellent story about the Stormwarden who is falsely accused and arrested due to a plot of an arch rival. Interesting twist in the story. Anxious moments while the Stormwarden has to rely on the help of a almost useless boy and a young semi crippled girl, whilst facing so many enemies. When you reach the end you just have to rush off and find book 2, with out delay to find out what happens next. Very Compelling. Excellent writer."
2,"Whoa, big difference between reading as a teen and as an adult","I read these books years ago (the three books in the Cycle of Fire) and when I saw them at my local Half-Price Books I picked them up again. I remember them as containing a good story in a believable world structure, if a bit too demon-ish at times (reminiscent of Tolkien).Well, upon this most current reading, I am noticing that the books are mostly narrative, with very little dialogue. So much is explained in narrative that I found myself glossing over large swaths of explanations until I could either get to the parts about Emien (none of the other characters engaged me emotionally, except perhaps the Captain-Kirk-like Kielmark), or until I reached a patch of dialogue. This made it an almost tedious read.I'm halfway through book 2, ""Keeper of the Keys,"" and I'm finding the same problem there. Too much narrative, not enough dialogue, not enough character development to really make me care. I may not bother finishing the series."
3,What kind of magic is that??!?!?,"OK, I liked this book as well as the whole trilogy. The plot was solid (even if there was a little too much sailing), the characters were interesting, and the story moved along pretty good. That being said, this has to be THE WORST explanation of magic in any story I've ever read!Magic coming from a crashed spaceship whose AI implants living crystals into your body is about the lamest idea I have ever read. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Fun, but HARD","This is a really fun game!! But some of the questions are hard! When our relitives came to our house for Christmas, it took them probably at least several hours and at least two times starting over before they finally got it. I think the questions are aimed at kids that are about 10, 11. But still, this is a fun game. I would recommened it!"
4,Is That Your Final Answer?,"Great for kids & adults. The Kids Edition brings you easier questions and more trivia for kids. Unlike the other versions, you answer questions about Music, Movies, Sports, Science, History, Games and more! Climb up the ladder of alot of $$$.Rating Who Wants To Be A Millionaire: Kids EditionQuestions 10/10The questions are great for kids everywhere!Value 7/10The value is a little on the low side but still worth the money!Graphics and Design 10/10The design is great and it's colors are just like on TV!The only reason that it lost a star is the annoying voice. It says the same thing on the same questions. Buy this for your Regis fan kid!!!"
5,What iv'e been waiting for,"I love all of the millionair games, but they are just to hard. this should be better because the questions should be easier and made for kids."
4,A game for a range of ages,"This game is extrememly popular in my house (kids 2, 5, 7, 10) with both the kids and their grandparents. The whole gang will hang out by the computer and work as teams."
3,Bosworth as a 'bad-guy',"A good watch, and Brian Bosworth as a 'bad guy'. Dean Cain is excellent in a movie with a better plot than expected. I truely enjoyed this movie,and Bosworth does a good job with his character. But the movie is Dean Cain's. A definte buy, and one you can watch over and over."
2,Could have been better.,"The best acting job in the whole movie, was Dean Cain himself. The telling of his back story could have been more detailed. It tended to be a bit disjointed in some areas. The action was pretty good though."
4,Explosive and Challenging,"The movie starts off as confusing,but it gets easier to understand,after 30 minutes.Dean Cain's character was an innocent dupe who gets caught up by mistake in a drug trade gone wrong.After being chased down through out the movie by the drug lord and being accused of knowing too much,when he doesn't know what Phase IV is until catching on to the operation,as being an experiment gone wrong.He finally goes to the police and his Journal professor,with the evidence,only to find out he got in deeper than needed and must solve a murder indirectly to stop the operation,and uncover a shady secret."
3,okay film,"This was an okay movie, plot was interesting, Dean Cain was a good actor as usual, but the whole thing didn't exactly set my foot a tapping. I think the topic of drug companies running amok is an interesting topic, but could have been dealt with more deeply. B movie. I like to see Dean Cain in any film, I think he's a fine actor, who is underappreciated."
1,This is not what it seems.,"One reviewer wrote the review about the ""Super Ants""....this is not that movie.This movie staring Dean Cain bites big time, unless you like movies about chases....there are several car chases, car chasing man, man chasing man, helicopter chasing car....Get the point?The plot is strained through out the movie in dribbles... if you can make it through the endless sceens showing actors walking around doing nothing,walking or staring blankly (probably wondering if this movie will ever be over).*** Fast forward special***"
4,Saw it on Cable and wanted it my collection,I am a big fan of Dean Cain and saw this movie on a cable channel and wanted to have it in my collection. Dean Cain does a wonderful job in this movie and the plot is reasonable and puts you on the edge of your seat.
1,onkyo,The glove was the product send not onkyo stereo TX-8011 black I just dont under stand why they send me glove
1,"This product is not a Receiver, it is a pair of gloves","Until this ad for a Onkyo Receiver is fixed, it is an ad for a pair of gloves and the written description is not what you will get. I called the seller, got my money back and shipping costs to boot, so I do recommend this seller, Tool King, out of the Denver area as a seller you might like to do business with, but tools or gloves would be the product you might want to seek. Good seller, bad ad."
1,I do not even recieve it,"If there is negative star, I will give it minus five stars because I did not receive this ONKYO Stereo Receiver at all. I was cheated."
1,"WARNING, BEWARE OF DEFECTIVE GLOVES!!!","THESE GLOVES WERE DOA! ONKYO I HAVE BEEN A LOYAL CUSTOMER, AND WAS JUST LOOKING FOR DECENT STEREO GLOVES FOR THE INEVITABLE STATIC STORM HITTING THE EAST COAST CHRISTMAS DAY...LOOKS LIKE I'LL HAVE TO HIT BB'S MONEY-DRAINING B&M TODAY TO FIND GLOVES THAT CAN GET SOME SORT OF RECEPTION."
5,Great product!,This is the best Glove/receiver that I have ever used. If I even hold up one finger every channel comes in crystal clear. The reception is even decent with my hands in my pockets. You can increase the volume just by pointing to one of the speakers. Great product! Keep it up Onkyo.
1,Save your money!,"What a waste of money! I was so excited for my daughter to use this product. What a disappointment when there were 2 holes in the top ring when opened. We inflated anyway so she could atleast try it out, she showed very little interest. Needless to say we boxed it up and are taking it back. I expected much more for $40! p.s. The product got 1 star because I had to chose atleast that."
3,No problems with holes for me,Wow. very suprised at the negative reviews. I guess I was lucky. No holes. I bought it for my 1 year old and had to constantly chase my 8 and 10 year old out of it!! It really doesnt bounce though. My daughter doesnt really like it. Should have put that 40 bucks in the college fund!!
1,"""Hole""y Bouncer, Batman!!","This unit had holes all over it when it was removed from the box. The interesting point is that the holes where not punctures, but instead they were where the seams were not sealed to hold the air along the sides. Unit was totally full of leaks from this situation. Shipped back to Amazon, and have not received credit yet though. Ordered a bounce house which uses a blower instead. ** Advice to evryone loking to buy a bounce unit.. get the fabric ones with a blower or you will be fighting holes in these cheap plastic units forever!"
4,Great as a ball pit,"I read the poor reviews, but decided to buy anyway since it was not that expensive. My kids (4, 2 and 6mo) love this product and it is holding up fine after almost 2 months of use. My kids are pretty rough with it as well... they drag it all over the basement, flip it over to use as a cave, jump on it when it is flipped over, etc. A little air has come out of it, but I haven't had to fill it up at all yet. We use it more as a ball pit, rather than a jumper. Although the kids do jump in it. I think this is great as a ball pit, since there is enough room in the bottom of it so that the balls don't just roll out. (We have 200 balls in there, but it could use/hold 100-200 more)Overall, very happy with it and would recommend."
1,Popped the first day,"My husband inflated it and was extra careful not to overinflate it but it still popped before the kids even had a chnace to try it. they were so disappointed:( this has now happened twice!!!!! fyi, the first one we inflated and it deflated within days (slow leak). what a waste! it is so heavy that it would cost $20 to mail it back for a replacement. don't bother."
1,Never got to use it!,"If rating a ""no star"" was possible, that's what it really deserves. I bought this for my two year old twin boys and as I was inflating it - with a handpump - it blew at the seams! Beyond patching! Unfortunately they never even knew that they had it. I would not buy it again because of the quality of the product. How can kids be safe jumping on something that blows out when being pumped by a hand pump??? That's like blowing it up by mouth!"
1,HUGE disappointment,"My 29 month old LOVED this for the whole two days that it held it's air. On the third day, we went to play only to find it deflated. It was a huge hassle to get all of the air out in order to send it back. I wouldn't waste my time."
1,Yet another leaker,"We too, had the joy of trying to explain why a gift from Santa had a hole in it. Now, the kids are so attached to the idea of having it, we had to call all over trying to find a replacement since Target put them on clearance. We've finally located 1 but we're having to drive a ways to buy it. I guess the fact that the price is down will make it worth the effort if we're lucky to find one without a hole! :-("
1,Jump-o-leaks,"Had 3 leaks all in the seams! Could not patch correctly even after waiting the ""30 mins."" to re-infalte like the directions stated. My son was extremely upset. From other reviews, it sounds like there is a 50/50 chance of getting a good product."
1,Flat Christmas,"I'm very dissappointed with this product. My husband and I inflated this on Christmas eve to surprise our 2 young children and heard several leaks. We spent almost an hour trying to patch the holes. Of course, Christmas morning the entire top section had de-flated. We came up with a story about Santa's reindeers horns poking the trampoline and causing it to go flat. This piece of junk is going back tomorrow!"
3,"great fun, but lacks durability","We purchased this product for our daughter's second birthday, going against a number of the reviews I read. My older children had the larger jumpolene when they were little, and it was a lot of fun. Since we only have one small child now, I was looking for something that had the same ability but could take up a little less space. The first jump-o-gym had to be returned since it started to deflate in less than a month. We exchanged it for a new one. The new one lasted less than two weeks, and we decided to return that one too. The product is fun, but it is a bit expensive to be ""disposable"". I intend to purchase the larger jump-o-lene once we get our money back."
3,Good quality....but for smaller kids,"My son isn't into it quite as much as I thought he would be. He prefers it upside down so he can make it into a fort. But it was easy to blow up (used the neighbors air compressor)...took about 5 minutes total. And it seems durable, although heavier children leaning or throwing themselves against the edge can tip it over. My advise is to use this for younger (2-4), slightly less rambunctious children, and get a full size regular tramp with a net for older ones. (5 and up)"
5,Hours of Enjoyment!,"I bought this item last Christmas for my 4 year old and two year old! We are lucky enough to have a large playroom in our house so we used it all winter and I decided to leave it inside for rainy day fun. We even put a sheet over the top and the girls use it as a fort! It di take a little while to blow up with a hand pump, but it was well worth the wait. I never would have expected it to last as long as it has for the money we spent! But it was so worth it!!!"
3,"""Ups and Downs""","I like the product and it is made well and looks as it is pictured, but, it should definitly be purchased for kids 3 and over. My foster kids are 18 months and 2 1/2 and they love the product, but they all BITE holes in it. I have patched holes and it's about to the point where I am going to have to take it down and get rid if it. I basically wasted the money I spent. Sorry! I would definitly recommend it for older children than mine, it could be a great purchase for them."
2,clearance,I got this on clearance like 2 years ago. I new it would not hold up. I had many kids on it because I do home daycare. My rule was only 3 kids at a time. The bigger kids could only go on 2 at a time. It got 3 holes which I patched. They even took naps in it. I must of had It for about 6 months and only keep it up for like a week at a time. My problem was it was hard to store. I had to leave it inflated some and pushed it in back of my closet. Finaly one of the big kid did a big belly flop on it and popped the seem. No way was that fixable. If I ever find it on clearance again I would buy it but not for what they are asking for it. Not worth it if it will break in a couple of months.
1,junk and they didn't want to take it back,We got this with some other accessories to go with it and even before we blew it up I saw there were holes on it. I tried patching it but nothing worked. Next day 2 out of 3 compartments were deflated. I have contacted the manufacturer and they told me there is nothing they can do because the item is discontinued and they don't take returns. So there goes my close to $100 gift in the garbage can because it was on the way and collecting all kind of bugs.
5,Great toy,"I bough this jumper over 2 years ago. It's not too expensive, and has held up to 2 kids (2 and 4) We put it in the living room on rainy days, and put it up at birthday partys. I have had no problems."
5,Excelent presentaion,"I like it very much and arrived on time, the paper is excellent an the book excellent nothing more to say, adssdkj"
1,Not happy yet,"I was sent the audio book of Eragon in a timely manner, however, it came in Spanish when I ordered English. I returned the item with a note explaining the circumstances and requesting to get it in English, however I still have not heard back regarding this matter. It has been quite a few weeks. Overall, I am getting a bit annoyed at the lack of cooperation in receiving the material I ordered and paid for."
3,"Worth the read, but nothing too special","I read Doomsday Warrior and fell into the trap, reading the other 25 or so to follow. They are good enough to read, but definately more pulp than literature. If you like the futuristic doomsday setting complete with mutants, evil agents from other defunct societies, sex, and fast-paced battle you will enjoy the read, otherwise don't even think about it. Pretty run of the mill as postwar books go, but some highpoints. This type of book is more for the high-schooler than anyone else."
3,alot of fast paced action,"I actually read #3 and #4 before I read the first 2 and I was hooked after that. Its a futuristic battle of good vs evit and it will keep you entrapped until the last page and leave you begging for more. The only problems I had with these books are 1) The Rock can do just about anything except kill the ultimate evil, Col Killov. and 2)Rock gets captured and escapes in just about every book."
4,Excellent Product for Small Fountains,"Excellent product for a small yard fountain such as the one I installed. The water reservoir I created was 4'x 4' x 1' with a small pocket for the pump. It worked out ok and a nice looking fountain. It was a good thing the sun was out, this product is PVC and I used the sun to warm the liner before it would conform to the shape I needed. Just keep in mind this product is only 20 mil thick, most coy ponds use 45 mil fish safe EPDM liner material. So, I don't think I would use this product for a coy pond unless I had the ok of an expert. Almost forgot, I measured the liner, like to know if I got what I paid for, and the width was 4"" short of 8' and the length was dead-on at 10'. Interesting!"
4,Excellent product nicely packaged,"This is a must have product for many different things, we used this as a liner in our front yard for a drainage application, it worked perfectly, saved us a lot of money and were planning on installing three small ponds so we hope to have a nice review for those in the near future."
3,"It was OK, but...","I was very pleased at first to discover the hardback cover version. I was looking for inexpensive children's books to pair with stuffed animals to be given to other children as gifts for a literacy program. This book was a perfect match. When I opened it and found crayola scribbling on some of the pages, I was disappointed. The price was right [1-cent], but S&H was $3.99, making it not only a $4.00 disappointment but worthless. Returning it would have been silly, especially since that involved additional S&H. I believe I have used this seller before with better results. This time was disappointing."
2,Fine until the zoom broke,"My Nikon Lite Touch 140 was fine until the zoom broke shortly after the 1-year warranty expired. I take care of my camera, so it was not my fault. The $70 bill was disappointing. A little latter the cord snagged a corner and tore open a metal cover, so again I had it repaired at my expense."
1,What a disappointment,"After owning an Olympus Stylus for 6 years, we decided to ""upgrade"" to the Nikon 140. Wow, were we surprised at the low quality. The camera ikons blinked inappropriately and the pictures came out worse than I ever imagined. The auto focus feature for up close photos looked like the people were hiding behind clouds.We are now going to try the Minolta 160. They seem to have more features as well."
3,Happy but disappointed at the same time,"I bought this Nikon 140ED as a graduation gift for my cousin. The camera is nice and light. Pictures come out nice and clear. It doesn't come with a camera bag, which is rather inconvenient, but that is trivial. Overall, I'm minutely satisfied with the camera. However, I do have a couple disappointments. It doesn't take multiple shots that well. We tried to take 2 or three pictures one after the other, and nothing happens. The camera refuses to take a second picture. We try waiting several seconds, but it is still unresponsive. Another feature of the camera that disappointed me is the flash. The distance of the flash is not as great as I expected it to be. ... For the NIKON name and quality, and that price, the camera usability and flash should exceed those of lesser brands and quality."
2,I would never buy a nikon again,"13 months after I purchased this camera, it froze up.Would cost $147 to repair. The manuel suggest a new a battery,which didnt do any good. Camera was never dropped or mis-handled. When it was working it took great pictures. But 13months!!!!"
2,Disappointed!!!,"I was excited to get this and ordered 2 sets!!! Unfortunately, the red is bright and has more of a pop online. When I got it in person, the red looks dull. Unhappy. have returned it and looking for other pattern and colour!"
3,As mentioned in Monty Python's Cheese Shop skit,"As mentioned in Monty Python's Cheese Shop skit ""Well, I was, uh, sitting in the public library on Thurmon Street just now, skimming through Rogue Herries by Hugh Walpole, and I suddenly came over all peckish."""
4,2001 Mazda Duel Sport,Works like Oem. Dont make mistake thinking the more shocks cost the better they are. I went through 2 other sets of shocks before getting these the cheapest ones. The sensatrac were to stiff and hard and rebounds. Gabriel Ultra truck shock was so very hard twice as bad as sensatrac. The cheaper u buy the more like normal like OEM it will ride. Theres not really better just harder.
1,Shock absorber would not work on truck.,I did not like this product because it had an attachment on one end that would not allow me to attach it to my Mazda b2200 truck. I paid for it but was unable to use it. Not one of Amazon's proud moments !!!!!!
2,"Great photos, inane captions. Other books are better.","It's hard to look at these beautiful photographs and not read the captions, since the captions take up a whole page opposite the photo. I like both Don and Fred, think they're amusing fellows. I can't imagine why they didn't make the captions more entertaining or enlightening, instead of sophomoric or irrelevant. Who cares that Don went back to the truck for a pack of cigarettes while Fred took a photo? Does this enhance your enjoyment one iota? Bless the Wee One, this is a major disappointment. Almost but not quite worth it for the pictures, you won't want to leave this lying around on the coffee table when your in-laws or children are around. (Or anyone with an ounce of intelligence.) All the shilling in the world won't make this a memorable experience. Pick up another photographer's book and enjoy it more"
2,not so great,Nothing exceptional about this book. Photos average. No story and ceratainly not humorous. Would not recommend to anyone for any reason
2,Pro-Am,"The photographs are composed well, but suffer from oversaturation and grain, especially in the sky areas. Complaining that Imus is crude is like complaining that Florida is hot and humid. The text is still funny, but the insults too repetitive."
3,An amusing diversion,I have been reading Arizona Highways. This is an amusing diversion. But I'm back on the road again.
1,"Two Guys, a Big Mouth, and Going too Far....","I never cared for Don Imus. His views and radio talk were all based on insulting other people, no matter who they were. So this book is as hollow as the man who wrote it. Today, with Don Imus having been fired from radio, after saying one bad thing too many, I can at last say that the whole country have at last seen the man for what he was and said ""Enough, Be Gone Now."""
2,not well tailored,"disappointed with fit for me . sleeves , body , shoulders not seem to match in size. it a sloppy shirt. i like the material though. i would not recommend this shirt."
4,Oveall a good buy,"My 2 year-old received this as a gift for his birthday. He really enjoys it, but my 16 month-old has liked it better so far. When he was first learning to walk, he enjoyed pushing it around, and both of them like sitting on it and pushing the buttons that play the music. I haven't seen them sit on it and scoot around much, but they still have had a lot of fun with it."
3,"Plane is great, but does fail....","We have had this plane almost 6 months now and after going through lots & lots of re-charge on the batteries the throttle has stopped working(after only one month), only one of the LEDs work, and last but not least it really doesn't hold up too well when it comes to all the moving parts. However, I must admit it is a hit with my 18 month old AND his friends. Everyone wants to ride the airplane...and crash it! I just wish it was more durable with the electronic parts."
2,I wish it worked,Unfortunately this plane doesn't work. The bear doesn't go up & down - the propeller doesn't spin - the gear shift doesn't make its' sound. The company was gracious enough to give me a full refund though. I've seen ones that work and they're great.
5,Dan Fogelberg,This CD was in great shape. There are 2 songs on the CD that bring back so many wonderful memories. I have been trying to find the CD for a long time now. Thanks Amazon
5,LOVE THIS ALBUM,"This is a cd my mother used to listen to when I was younger. It brings back so many memories. My husband and I are taking our 3 year old to see Dan perform in 2003, and I can't wait for my daughter to hear this excellent musician!"
5,Great but not complete by far,"Dan Fogelberg has been releasing wonderful albums for almost 30 years now, and this collection of ""greatest hits"" dates back to 1982, i.e. it only spans the first ten years of his extraordinary career. I highly recommend you get the 4-CD boxset ""Portrait"" instead - which includes all of the songs on the album (in some cases remixed or in even better live versions). ""Greatest Hits"" is a wonderful introduction to the timeless music of Dan Fogelberg and will leave you wanting for more, so go for the ""big"" Portrait collection straight away."
3,Entertaining Story,"The movie has an excellent story line, but there are some disconnects like the Jack's relationship with Mallika Sherawat. Also, the bad guy is ""injected"" into the story halfway through, without any prior mention.The ending is weak -- the biggest disappointment."
2,Jane under wraps,"Half of this disc consists of Columbia 78 RPM tracks from 1947-1951. Unfortunately, the audio reprocessing is so poor that Jane sounds as if she is singing with a towel wrapped around her head! This greatly detracts from listening enjoyment. Subsequent tracks from early '50's vinyl sources are not as bad, but I'd label this ""for completists only."" Look for the current legit reissue of Jane's ""Let's Put Out The Lights"" album from which eight of the tracks on this semi-bootleg were taken."
2,"A second to ""Jane Under Wraps""","The reviewer who wrote that review is precisely correct. Sepia records has done us a great service by preserving many great albums. Sadly, this isn't one. The sound is very poor on about 1/2 the tracks."
4,Rare,"It never relly impress, exept the fantastic ""I belive in god"", but the musical visions and landscapes Nigel Kennedy opens up in this record, is new landmark. It is prog rock!"
4,Absorbing and solid,"Composer Terry Plumeri manages to create an interesting, atmospheric score for what turned out to be the final film of the ""Death Wish"" series. The music works superbly in the movie and remains a satisfying listening experience on it's own; this cd would likely be better remembered (and still in print) if it didn't follow the brilliant first soundtrack by Herbie Hancock and the fascinating ""Death Wish 2"" by Jimmy Page. ""Death Wish 5"" doesn't sound anything like those earlier soundtracks and still holds up extremely well.Plumeri deserves recognition and high marks for this work and the cd is recommended."
1,"Next time, at least get a REAL fan to proofread your BOOTLEG TRASH!!","I was just about to.............but then upon closer inspection, I realized there were a bunch of people that were duped into buying this as an authentic item. They were all selling this on a very very well known auction website. Anyways, honestley If you are going to bootleg leg something even if its old VH1's video clips, atleast don't have the temerity to list all the information on the back of the case with one single ERROR. IT PIPES OF PEACE......not pipes of SPACE. Also for the time period they covered they excluded the videos O'uest Di Soeil & Put it there,(which is one of my favorites, by the way). Save your money on this,if you want the real thing your going to have to wait for Macca to release the whole load as a compilation DVD one day. Till then you'll just have to do what the Japanese do, Laser disc collect."
1,A fraud,"Only Astro has any credibilty of the reviewers here.Read the reviews of the ""other writers."" They all penned their ""other reviews"" on the same day, and they were written by a PR firm, not a real fan."
1,They must be kidding,"Who are they trying to fool -- kindergarten kids? EMI/Capitol/Parlophone wouldn't revisit a 1987 greatest hits package and include videos from the ""Flaming Pie"" years. And the typos -- ""Back In The Eggs?"" Come on, if you want to fool people, you need to do a little research and know how to spell titles correctly.I recommend buying the legitimate, professional and crystal-clear ""The McCartney Years"" 3-DVD set instead.The McCartney Years"
3,it does what is says,"It does what it says it does, but you cannot make a mistake there is no way to correct it by going back and changing a stroke if you accidently put one more or one less on the score keeper. Like I said it does what it says, it keeps scores for up to four players named players 1-4 ( no names input) and keeps score up to 18 holes; that's it. You're better off purchasing one of the $40.00 or up ones, thy are more forgiving (can correct mistakes) you can also save games, save courses, and save player names, add yardage and so forth, this one you can only keep score, but you get what you pay for."
3,"Great Deo, but false advertising","Well the deo works as it should but the product description was misleading. I only received a single stick whereas it says ""Pack of 6""."
4,"Not all natural, but no aluminum, no dyes, no artificial fragrance","This might be meant for men, but I'm not a man and I use it. :)I don't want to use anything with aluminum. Even the all-natural ""mineral"" stuff is 100% alum, which defeats the purpose. So, I went to the store and looked at all the deodorants. All had artificial colors and scents except this one. It does have a scent, but it's natural and very mild (I don't smell whiffs of it during the day). It's not 'manly' or 'womanly.' It works, but you still might perspire because of the lack of aluminum crud.As for the all-natural non-alum deodorants and anti-perspirants which are available (Tom's, Kiss My Face, Jason, etc.), they simply don't work for me. They seem nice but I perspire even more, and body odor becomes a problem (which is isn't with the Speed Stick).I don't give it 5 stars because it contains propylene glycol. I'd still rather have that than aluminum."
1,Beware: New Formula,Speed Stick changed their product and it no longer works more than a few hours.Useless.
5,You too can be stink free,"I've been using Speed Stick deodorant regular for years. It is effective at killing stink. It has a nice smell when you apply it. The smell is not overpowering and it is not noticeable after a few minutes (I have smell sensitivity). This product does not stain clothes or leave any marks. I tried Tom's and Trader Joe's natural deodorant but neither of those worked and I could smell my own BO long before the day was over. While I like to buy products that have no animal testing, I draw the line with BO and use my Speed Stick deodorant. It's great for men or women and it's inexpensive."
5,Smells good!,"I love the way this deodorant smells... so much that after CVS stopped carrying it, I made my boyfriend order it from here!"
5,Great price for deodorant,Had a hard time finding it in the stores. Was glad to get it on here and at that price. Will do it again when my hubby runs out.
3,If only it lasted longer...,"This is the best-smelling, least-irritating deodorant product I have ever used. Unfortunately the tradeoff for me is that it only lasts a few hours. If you perspire little, and tend to get irritation from strong deodorant, this might be the perfect product for you. If you perspire a lot (like me), and have to be around people a lot during the day (like me), you'll probably want to find something stronger."
1,Very bad,This Cd is really bad. I bought it to use for choreographing Swan Lake Ballet and it's just awful. I just couldn't use any of the tracks. It sounds muffled. Don't waste you money it sounds terrible.
5,The Best Swan Lake!,"In my opinion, the greatest of Tchaikovsky's three ballets is ""Le Lac des Cynges (Swan Lake)"" (Op. 20). This ballet is the longest and the most interesting, exhilirating, and beautiful music he has ever written.This recording of Swan Lake is the best one I've heard so far. This recording has excellent sound quality, the cymbals are loud, and the echoing effect is perfect. If you are a ballet fan like me, you will like--no--love this recording of Swan Lake. The speed is perfect, not too fast, and not too slow. I think that this recording would make an excellent addition to anyone's ballet collection."
4,The best rendition,"I enjoyed this cd because all the other ""complete versions"" had parts missing. To my big surprise, this also has a big cut in it concerning the music for the black swan. I was, to say the least, a bit taken aback because of this, but comparing the time on these discs, this version surpasses any other in length so I guess I'm satisfied as well as miffed. This rendition is clear, crisp, and moves at a the correct pace a very good recording. You can't beat it for the price that its being sold for."
5,Great mower,"Awesome mulching mower... Delivery was delayed by nearly a week due to a UPS error, so my lawn had gone two weeks without a cut during a period of a lot of rain. One pass and the grass was cut and mulched, no lines, no residual clumps. We were very impressed!"
3,Its a model,"This is a very detailed and through MODEL KIT! Notice that this is a model kit ad not a toy, I'd recommend it for a cllector of some sort. Also, be careful, some peices are more fragil than others."
4,Not sure about this one,"I own ""Aesthetics of Change"" and a few other Keeney titles. I've read each of them numerous times. I've been a fan of Keeney since the day I cracked open my Dad's copy of ""Aesthetics of Change"" years ago. Reading Keeney's books tends to be very enlightening.That said, I'm not sure about ""Everyday Soul"". It's a fascinating read, for sure, but it is quite off-base from Keeney's more ""scientific"" works. Granted, this isn't a psychology book...I'm well aware of that. With all of Keeney's other books that I've read, I've been enlightened with new understanding that has a real impact on my life, so when ""Everyday Soul"" assumed the stance that understanding is an obstacle to spirituality, I was a bit disappointed.I'm still giving this book 4 stars because there are plenty of typical Keeney bits of wisdom sprinkled throughout, and my own expectations lead to the disappointment I felt."
3,Not so best of...,"I love switchblade symphony, so don't get me wrong... I just want to make it known that this is a sort of ""best of"" cd. The songs come from their 3 cds which are all still available, and have far better recordings than this one. Nothing new or spectacular here, and it would be a pity to pass up any of the earlier cds for this one."
2,Remote will not work for LED color change cube,"This remote may work well for the other iHome systems;however, we bought it because it was recommended on the website that it was frequently bought with the iHome LED color changing cube. When we tried it, it wouldn't work. I called the iHome customer support center and they claimed that there is not a remote for the iHome LED color changing system. So I am going to return it for a refund. I cannot review the remote's capabilities since it wouldn't work for this iHome we have. I just wanted to let others know that they shouldn't buy any remote for the LED iHome color changing cube because there really isn't a remote for it."
4,This cute little remote works good for me!,"I use this remote in my bedroom with my Ihome docking station/alarm clock IH4P and it works great. I can play my Ipod with a touch of the button, change the song or adjust the volume. The snooze button on my remote is used to adjust the background base.When you have to change the battery make sure it is a cr2032 or 3v and that the logo of the button battery facing towards the bottom of the remote. The battery used in the remote is the same as the backup clock used in the Ihome product so I suggest buying a few sets so you won't have to worry about your alarm or remote going out. Enjoy!"
1,Incompatibility of this product,"Bought this to go together with the Impod clock radio docking station for my grandaughter because it was suggested on the Amazon site that they be purchased together. Unfortunately, they are not compatible and wont work together Amazon should update their site."
1,Remote does not work with the cube,I ordered this product because Amazon mentioned that this remote was often purchased with the cube. I should have done more research because if I would have I would have read that the cube does not have a remote that works with it. Do your research before you purchase. Not really sure if the remote works because it does not work with the speaker I purchased it for. The one star rating is more for Amazon than for the remote itself.
1,"NOT WORTH IT, might as well get up yourself...","I bought this remote for my iH5 version. It claims to just work when you get it, but I seemed to be having some trouble. After checking the battery and making sure it was all set, I was still confused as to why it wouldn't work. There were no helpful reviews online either. Turns out, according to some instructions (NOT INCLUDED!!!) you have to aim it at the grill on the right hand side. This only works if you are within about 6 inches from it, and even then it's SOOOOO particular, it's like it's a tiny dot you have to find for the iHome to respond. If you really wanna press it 100 times before you get that longer distance assistance, go ahead. Otherwise, you might as well get up and change it yourself because the remote won't do it for you. Definitely not worth the money, would not recommend."
1,Unadvertised feature (bad),"You won't find this documented anywhere, but apparently this remote only works when the iHome is plugged in and powered. If you are unplugged and running off the battery it does not work. I assumed this was a defect and contacted iHome customer support. I was told that was expected behavior. Nice. I was really hoping to remote-enable the iHome on the patio but that dream is dead.This remote generally worthless for my intended use."
2,Rarely works,I honestly have to have the remote 3 inches away from the device in order for it to work.
1,Wrong item,I ordered this item from Amazon but got iHR5 instead. I notified Amazon and they promptly issued a return auth and processed getting the correct item to me. I then received another iHR5. Amazon concluded that they could not fill my order and issued a refund. I don't know if they have this item or not.
2,I Need Help!!',I bought this remote because it stated on Amazon that it wad frequently bought with the ihome that I purchased but when I received it . The remote didn't work with my ihome but it works with my friend ihome system. how is that even possible? Is there a way to sync the remote to my iPod. I'm confused and need help
1,Never worked!,"This item is junk! Never worked straight out the box, even went out and bought new batteries! I would definitely not recommend this product for purchase."
1,Check on it before you buy,It just doesn't work on my iHome. I inadvertently threw mine out with the packing from a cross country move. This one clearly is the wrong one for my model. I would have returned it if I hadn't thrown out the packaging. I didn't see anything on the amazon site about which models this works with. I guess I will just throw it out. I wouldn't have given it any stars but I was forced to.
1,Don't advertise with a product it doesn't go with!,This product is advertised as a companion product to the iHome cube. Guess what? It doesn't work with the iHome cube. What a waste of time and money.
4,basic fluid power,"I purchased a used book, it is in very good condition for the price. It is a great reference tool. Thanks"
3,cute but LOUD,"this is a neat little bedtime doll. uniqua sings a sweet little lullaby to sherman the worman, but she sings it loudly. you can only turn it on and off, no volume control. i tried taking the unit out to put something over the speaker, but part that emits the sound isn't in the same part of the doll as the battery pack is.neat doll for a backyardigans fan, but not for bedtime. our doll also did not come with the hat pictured, but it was purchased from a store, not amazon so it is possible that ours was a different style or the hat was removed while it was in the store."
4,"Romantic 'popular' songs by Kiri, particularly for women","Kiri's voice is so remarkable she can even sing 'country' (Pieces of April). Her timing and expression of a David Foster song (The Best of Me) would compete with Celine Dion anytime. The only weakness in the album (and it is considerable) is with her collaborator, Malcolm McNeill. However popular he may be 'at home', his voice is so overshadowed by hers that it is difficult to listen to them together. Fortunately, she does many 'solo', so the album is still great, especially if a 'remote' is handy. Unfortunately, it seems to be difficult, if not impossible, to obtain this CD now, so Kiri as a 'pop' singer will likely leave that stage to Celine or Barbra. I loved it though, so covet my rare copy."
1,Broke In Five Minutes!,I bought this disc for my three year old for Christmas. He tossed it around for five minutes then the edges tore open. I couldn't believe it! It took longer to inflate than it did to break. Big dissapointment.
1,Hover Disc,"This product was not what I expected. The material is not durabel, the ring around the plastic came out, plus it's quite expensive for those people that would have to buy a tank of helium to fill the hover disc. I think it's not worth the price, cuase it does not last to long before it breaks. My 3 year old son only played with it just few hours before it broke bad product it needs to be improved. :("
3,Oh Well!,This gave me a good idea and I used it but the materials were too rigid. A heavier and softer material would have been much better.
2,Poor quality control,"I'll bet this comes from China, or at least I hope its not American made. One of the main side supports was not measured properly when drilled. I was able to compensate by pulling out my own drill, and I guess those extra holes will drain it?! Be prepared when you go to put it together. I was also amazed at the condition of the box when delivered. I was shocked that the items inside were not damaged."
4,Yard Cart,"Love it. Received this item in about 2 weeks, and was delivered by truck, which they were kind enough to put in the backyard for me. The cart was easy to put together, and is a perfect size for all the branches and debris from our yard. Perfect!"
4,Something different!,"I actually watched the soap on their website [...] and I really like it. I'm not a soap fan myself but this one is different. Fresh, fast pace, good acting and real life problems. The plot is very interesting you never bored.I suggest this product to people, I,m gonna buy it myself."
5,Intec GameCube Wireless Mini Controller - 2-pk.,"Bought this unit for my Grandson. I dont play. I watched him use the system right out of the box,{after he installed 2x2 AA Bats. I must say i was impressed at how agile and skilled he was playing Maden Football. The wireless was clean and unclutered. The best part was the price from Amazon Partner,fulfillment solutions. Highly Recomend! Hope this helps future buyers."
5,These work Great,"I bought these to go with my sons WII. I had previously purchase 4 controllers from gamepro and gamecrazy 2 from each. All of them fell apart, by this I mean buttons wouldn't work and the joystick portion started coming loose on all 4 of the others. My son has been using these for a while now and we have not had a single problem. Only thing I noticed was that when putting new batteries in the controller you have to make sure the two wire pins dont get bent. But this is easily fixed and not a problem at all considering the quality of the overall controller compared to the previous ones we have had.UPDATE:8/24/09 They Lasted about a year but Both controllers have finally made it to the trash. I contribute this mainly to my sons extremely heavy abuse, by this I mean he is always dropping them on the floor"
2,Poems for Paula,"Fred Morgan's second to last book is, like all his other books, dedicated to his wife and co-editor of The Hudson Review, Paula Dietz. But this book more than the others is a tribute to his love for his wife. That being said, most of the poems in this collection are pretty weak. The only one I found any interesting was the opening poem. If you want to pick up a collection of Morgan's poetry, go with his latest collection, The Abiding One."
5,Confessions of a spy,"Very interesting book, highly recommended for people that enjoy to learn more about non-fictional international intelligence affairs. Should also teach intelligence agencies how to prevent moles within their own organizations."
3,Confessions of a spy,"Interesting but quite wordy. So many names, details ranks and unlikable characters to keep track of that I eventually turned off. I found it difficult to relate with any great interest."
4,Good read,"I read Spy Handler a while back and really enjoyed that. This book was obviously a little more intimate because it was mostly written based off of interviews with those who were directly involved with the case, as well as Ames himself. Definitely gives a very good play by play of the 9 years Ames spied for the KGB as he describes in his own words what made him do what he did, how he did it and how he went from rags to riches in what seemed like overnight. Aside from getting a good idea of how deplorable this man was the real individual you learn to despise in this whole dispicable story is his 2nd wife Rosario. Very easy to root against this woman as she comes off to be even more repulsive than Ames. Overall, some parts were a little slow but if you really want to know the actual story behind this countries most notorious and damaging spy I would say this is a must read!"
1,Okuma never more,"If you buy this reel and you will have to service it, sooner than later, especially before the first use. You will have to upgrade the drag washers and service it at least three times a year. So the money you spend servicing it you can buy a Shimano that is better. In the end you get what you pay for, i am using my titus as a door weight."
2,Toastmaster Toaster,"Made of very light plastic contruction and weighing in at 2 1/2 lbs, this toaster shouts ""cheap"". The toaster does toast well and evenly. The side supports are spring loaded and keep the bread centered. The darkness adjust knob is adjustable from 1 - 5. However, I don't understand the designers of this adjustment since I use a setting of ""1.5"" to get nice brown toast. Makes you wonder what a setting of ""5"" would do. I have not used the defrost or reheat settings. The bagel setting turns off the inside elements for one sided toasting. A major problem: the slots are too shallow. large bagels and standard loaf bread slices do not go all the way down, leaving a small but noticable light edge along the top. If I had to do it over, I would buy a different model."
1,Bad toaster!,"I bought this as a gift for my father. It did not work from the beginning. No matter what we tried, the toaster would not brown evenly. I had to call customer support to get a new one. Hopefully, the replacement will work better."
1,terrible toaster,"Does not toast bread consistently--burns part of toast while other part is hardly toasted. Handle broke after about 1 month's of use. Even before the handle broke, it would often not put the toast down-- handle had to be pushed over and over again. Don't buy this toaster!"
2,A mixed cruise,"The gorgeous music is ruined by godAWFUL dialoguesequences that make you press the MUTE button.Why did the presenters do this?? The big chorusnumbers are wonderful. It's a mixed bag. For sheermusic, find another CD."
2,Defective disc.,"I received this item on July 27, 2005. I played it on my portable CD player and found out that Disc 2 of the set was defective. It kept on skipping on my CD player. So, I returned it for a refund."
1,Armenian Needle Lace/ Knotted Lace,"This book is written about Armenia Needle lace as well as a brief overview of Armenian history. Instructions are given for basic needlelace, specific pattern stitches along with patterns and pictures showing the finished lace work.Outstanding book on a very interesting ancient lace makeing method. Easy to understand, easy to follow."
5,The Best Brady Soundtrack Ever!,"If you love both of the Brady Bunch movies then you'll absolutely love this one. Even though there aren't many songs, they are all good. You don't have to worry about what song it on because no matter what you'll like it. A must-have for all Brady fanatics!"
3,Decent soundtrack.....,"Picked this up for the Davy Jones movie version of Girl....not bad otherwise....the actors talking bit parts between tracks was a little distracting , but it is a soundtrack, so know that going into it.. there are some nice tracks for everyone"
4,For every Brady fan's collection.,"I liked the new versions of the old songs from the show. Plus, the rest of the music is classic!"
3,"Not bad, but...","The disk itself is exactly what I wanted - I use my bike to commute every day, and even pants straps don't always keep my pants (or socks) out of the chain.The weak point is the plastic mounting ""bolt"" - it's so soft that the hole for the hex nut was completely shredded by the time I had the bolt mostly mounted. As a result, if I want to take the disk off I'm going to have a very hard time."
1,Pure Crap,"The description of this product is very misleading. The manufacturer does not tell you all of the tools required to install this schlocky device. If you are not mechanically inclined and do not feel like taking apart your entire pedal, do not purchase this piece of unsightly plastic."
1,Its ok,Well the Emerson Personal AM/FM Radio HR2001 was ok if you want a low cost radio but has poor reception and the battery door can come loose if the unit is jaring around. I would suggest using another pair of ear/head phones than the ear phones supplied. Other than that the radio is decent and works verry good.
1,Keep your money,"Would not even give this a one star except that I have no choice in the selection for this reveiw format. This is easily the worste radio I have ever purchased. Did not even pick up major market stations, in a major metropolitan area, within less than 10 miles from the tower, outside, on a clear day, without loosing the station. Save yourself the trouble of purchasing and then returning this one and try a better radio."
2,Not really worth it.,"Although this player was compact and the sound was decent, the battery life was just awful and it was useless within two months. This radio wasn't manhandled. It's my office radio and doesn't leave my desk. For some reason, if I let this sit without use for a week to two weeks, the battery got completely drained. Now the ""lock"" feature is permanently on and won't disengage. Do yourself a favor and buy something else."
1,You Get What You Pay For...,"I purchased this walkman when I needed something cheap to take on walks and runs with me. What I got was something cheap that sits in a drawer.I live in a large, metropolitan area and I could only get two or three of the radio stations I get in my car, house, etc. It would spontaneously stop working, and sometimes would not start again, even after removing and replacing the batteries.Sadly, I cannot think of a situation or person for whom this would be a good purchase. Please save your money, or spend a few more dollars to get a walkman that works."
2,It works....,"Had to exchange my first one as the FM band stopped working after a week. Target changed it with no questions, this one worked fine, reception is OK were the signal is good, don't expect much out of town.I have found that batteries seem to run down even when it's not on, so if you go a couple of weeks between uses, you will either need take them out or keep a new set handy, not good.As other reviewer have said, it's OK, but your probably better off spending a bit more on a Sony."
3,Not so hot...,"I live in a little, out-in-the-woods town. One a good day, with a strong radio, we can get upwards of about ten radio stations. Fifteen if you don't mind static. This little radio works great, but not if you live where I live! In my trips to bigger towns reception was great. In my town (I intended to use it while walking/joggin) I only could tune into one or two stations. It didn't last too long, but by then I was ready to buy a bigger radio. All in all, great for the amount you pay, and perfect for a child as a present. Not great if you intend to actually use it a lot."
1,Emerson Personal Radio,"This radio is terrible. It is very difficult to get reception in the health club, which I can accept. But even running outdoors I have difficulty picking up signals. It's small, which is nice, but it doesn't work very well."
1,Too Easy,"If you buy this for the nostalgic game play, be prepared to be disappointed. It's nearly impossible to get anything but the highest spot. To make it more difficult, I've reversed wood holding the rods in place, there by increasing the slope. This change can be done with little effort, though I don't think it will last very long unless you drill out a recessed area for the screw heads like the product was intended to be put together.Even with this modification, I've found that you'll still want to prop the back up by a half inch to increase the difficulty."
3,Improvement??,"Our parents have an older version of this game so we thought the kids would enjoy having one. The new one we received is so easy it is ridiculous-there is no challenge. I'm not sure if we got a defective one or if it was made to be easier, regardless it was a huge disappointment. God forbid things be hard to do-the kids might actually learn patience and perseverence."
5,Hubbys toy,Men can be so hard to buy for. This game has been a blast to play. My husband loves it and so do the kids when they get a turn.
2,missing ball,"Ball was not in pakage, so can't play with it. Kids are not happy, not how we wanted Chrsitmas to start."
5,Gift,"I didn't personally play with this, but it was well received by the recipient.. It was also well recieved by everyone else in the house...everybody wanted a turn trying to beat the game!"
3,"Fun game, doubt it will hold up too long.","This classic game is still a classic. We have had it for two months and it is still performing. The screws that hold the ends on require frequent tightening which is no big deal. I can see the ends breaking off sometime soon though due to ""normal kid play""."
4,Great stringing kit,"I prefer soft mesh for my sticks, but the kits are almost impossible to find now. It's pretty easy to restring this kit...youtube has some excellent tutorial videos if you need help with it. The sticker looks great on your car. Break-in period on the dura mesh is a little long for my taste, but it's way less than a traditional pocket."
4,STX Duramesh,"This mesh is one of the best types I have experimented with. Being a guy who likes no whip, but a very high pocket in his stick, this took me literally 10 minutes to string up. I threw with it, and it worked great. It isn't the best mesh I have ever used (Marc Mesh), but it is certainly STX's top of the line mesh, and is as the name implies, very durable to weather. I recommend this mesh to everyone who plays the sport and needs a new string job."
4,rerecordings,an entertaining collection of rerecordings by orginal artists most of them live.an excellent value to be located in a used CD bend.
4,Strange album cover -- good music,"When I first heard ""Sleeping with Open Eyes"" on the radio years back, I could tell just from this one song that this band were intelligent, wise, and talented. I was not disappointed when I brought the CD home. Every single song on this disc is relatively good and should be given a chance by the public. What you get here are 13 intelligent, tuneful songs that mix folk and rock without being pretentious about it. The intellect that underscores this album is more basic than the kind that's flaunted in an attempt to get critical praise and ""indie"" popularity. This album should have had more attention given to it."
4,possibilities,"Not bad, it has some possibilities. There are some decent songs here, Sleeping with Open Eyes being one of them. Worth a chance."
5,The only food I give my cats!,"My cats have been on Hill's Science Diet since they came home as kittens. This food is great and keeps them very healthy, it's what the vet has always recommended and I've stuck with for my cats. I get the big bag because it's easier to store it in a large air-tight container near their food and not have to worry about buying food every other week or so. So glad to see this on Amazon Prime now, I used to have to go out of my way to speciality pet stores just to get it as places like PetCo out here don't always carry it.EDIT/UPDATE: My oldest cat is turning 6 this year and my younger one will be 4 later this year. Both are still very healthy, active, and not overweight."
5,Best Catfood,"My cat is picky. He also gets an upset stomach over other varieties of cat food. However, Science diet adult optimal works best. It was used at the shelter we bought him and he loves it and this big bag, as long as it is put in a Gallon sized tupperware type container is about half price of any pet food store."
1,DON'T TRUST THEM WITH YOUR ANIMALS LIFE,"My 19 1/2 year has ate Science Diet all her life, they changed the food she always ate and now she won't eat. I wrote them and they wrote me back basically letting me know they DO NOT CARE ABOUT MY CAT it is all about the money to them!!!"
4,grommet problem,"I love the way the pot cooks the food fast, well and evenly. I am concerned about the grommets holding the handle to the pot itself leaking a white residue."
5,My First Review Ever,"I have been a customer of [...] for years and I've never posted a review. I've purchased books, CDs, DVDs, software, electronics, cameras, and even bakeware. I've never complained and surely don't intend to start now.I am also not a classical music expert, just a fan. I know there is some debate among Dvorak fans regarding conductors. Some say Kubelik; some say Kertesz. For the symphonies, I settled on Kertesz, (Dvorák: The Symphonies), and I love it.But when it came to Dvorak's dances, Szell's leadership of the Cleveland Orchestra beats both other conductors, hands down. I just love listening to it.In my opinion, the dances are much more lively and colorful compared to the more stale and march direction of Kubelik and Kertesz.For all classsical music buffs, this CD is a must for your collection."
4,Sonic treasures of the historical memory!,"The renowned figure of Georges Szell has always been regarded a better accompanist conductor (His overwhelming collaboration with Casadesus in the set of Mozart's piano concertos or his renowned job with Fleisher in both Brahms and Beethoven piano Concertos), for instance, rather than soloist conductor.Nevertheless, his egregious baton legated for the posterity some remarkable recordings. And this is truly, one of his most notable ones.If it's certain these dances lack the vibrant histamine conferred by Talich with the Czech Philharmonic, we could affirm the Cleveland was probably who sounded idiomatically closer than any other American Orchestra, during the kingdom of his baton (I make this judgment before the arrival of the Boston with Rafael Kubelik since the seventies) .Whereas, these performances are since its release cult recordings that must not be absent from your collection . These are major items of the historical memory."
4,For Devotees and Novices,"My copy of this CD has ""traveled"" several times, as I've loaned it out to friends who want to dip their toes into the pool of classical music. The usual result after hearing the Slavonic Dances is, they're hooked, and they buy their own copies, then move on to larger works such as symphonies and concertos.Dvorak wrote some great large-scale works for orchestra, notably the incredible cello concerto, but I think that, like Grieg, he was at his best in small-scale gems like these, with their delightful mix of moods and tempos. No. 2, the dumka in E minor, is my favorite, but they all have their merits.I've heard other recordings of the Dances, and none of them are bad, but I'm partial to this delightful rendition by Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra, as it has made ""true believers"" out of people who thought they would never like classical music."
3,Nice sound but didn't last,"Really wanted a lanyard headphone for my mp3 player. Neck strap and earbuds in one piece and less wires. This product is exactly what I needed. Lightweight and the sound quality was just fine. The silicone earbuds come in three sizes so the bud was simple to get the correct fit. Though it was made for another brand of mp3 player, attaching the lanyard to my iriver mp3 player was simple using the RING. Would have rated this product 4 stars.Unfortunately, I got only 2 weeks of listening from it! Now the earbuds crackle so badly and cut in and out so I will have to dump the ones I have. The wire that connects to the mp3 is finicky and must be at just the right angle. If it gets bumped, no sound.If you get this product, use a pipe cleaner or electrical tape or some other method to hold the wire in a fixed position from day one so there would be no ""wear"" on the wire. Wish I had."
2,Lasted less than two months,"I bought the headphones with lanyard for light use at work. I did not hang my ipod from the lanyard (so no extra weight pulling on the cords). It worked pretty well, although the movement of the wires against my clothing was fairly loud. Still worth the trade off, except the sound completely died in one of the earbuds after less than 2 months of use. Very disappointing."
5,A Fascinating View of a Small-Town Japan,"If one desires to learn more about various aspects of small-town Japan during the early twentieth century, this is a definite buy.Every account given in the book is easy to read, interesting, and paints a vivid picture of how life was around a century ago. I found that I was wanting the book to be much longer as I learned so much from the stories and was thoroughly entertained. Subjects ranging from the work of a tofu-merchant to the rarity of shorts are covered so a wide range of information is available. Overall, I highly recommend this book."
5,Magnífico Glenn Gould!!,Estas versiones de estos pequeños preludios fugas y fuguettas que Bach compuso cuando trabajaba al servicio del príncipe Leopold de Anhalt-Cöthen son realmente maravillosas por su perfección y simplicidad de forma.Gould nos regala una versión magistral de estas obras con su singular digitación y especialísima interpretación. Simplemente hermoso.
4,Sturdy case.,"I think this case is great for the Kid Tough camera. I like that it teaches my son that things should be put away safely, and as tough as the camera is, it should still be protected because it is important to him. It makes it easier to put it on a shelf or bring it with, protecting from dust, dirt, etc. However, I took one star off of my rating because rather than a handle, it has a small tab. When trying to teach my son to keep his camera safe to take it with us, it works against me because he cannot easily hold on to it. Because the camera is a good size, it usually means he uses both hand to hold it. Not convenient or practical. Fisher Price should add a common sense handle!"
4,A Piano with feelings,"I love piano music and if you like it too, you can't miss this album. This were my first aproach to Raul DiBlasio and because I'm Latin (Mexican), I found my self pretty familiar with the tracks in it. Must of them are music from Mexico as South America, and also has a few music from Bebbu Silvetti (Piano), which is so far my favorite.The album has no songs, only piano (instrumental) music. But, other albums has tracks with songs. However, you don't buy the album because you expect to someones sings. So, the piano music is good enough just to buy it."
5,These rotors are NOT coated,"Product description is in error. These are the 121 series rotors and they are NOT coated--E or otherwise. The 120 series rotors appear to be the same as these except that they ARE coated, but cost more."
4,For big time Paula fans only,"If you are a true Paula Deen fan as I am, you will buy this book regardless. I don't think this one is near as good as her other cookbooks. There are alot of recipes provided by friends and peers, and a few repeats from previous cookbooks. And seems like several are more exotic than her normal downhome type of things. I always liked Paula's older recipes cause chances are you already had most of the ingredients already in the pantry. I know it would be hard for her to keep coming up with original recipes given her schedule, but I'd give my eye teeth for another book of solely Paula and her family's recipes of good old southern cooking.If you watch Paula on tv and are looking for a good sampling of her work, pick up The Lady & Sons Savannah Country Cookbookor Just Desserts and you'll turn to it time and time again. For true die-hard fans who already own the other three, you'll enjoy the intros and witty comments made by Paula throughout the book."
3,Paula Please Stick To Your Family's Recipes,"I liked this book but, as was stated earlier I wish she would stick to her original recipes instead of finding friends to come up with recipes to fill her cook book so she will have enough to be able to publish it. Paula's cooking has a distinctive personality and taste where as her friends recipes you never know what you are going to end up with. Paula please stick with your recipes. I am from the south and that is the only cooking I have known and to put other recipes in your book in my opinion takes away from the character of the book."
4,Great menu suggestions,This book provides great menus for a variety of entertaining. The recipes are easy to use and are food that is familiar to everyone - nothing so exotic that you have to go to a speciality store to buy it.
2,unreliable,"I have made five recipes from this book so far and have found it to be rather unreliable. The Spicy Tomato Soup required double the amount of chili as called for; The All Day Mushrooms needed salt--not included in the recipe or instructions; The Chicken Divan was heavy, thick, too rich, too processed and too salty (I added no salt). The Marinated Tomatoes and Green Chili Corn Muffins were the only recipes that turned out perfectly according to the ingredients lists and instructions. Somebody failed to test these recipes properly before publication, or that is my best guess. I haven't bought any of her other books, but hold higher hopes for Paula without her friends."
1,Very Disappointed,"I purchased this book, and I was extremely disappointed...It states to get a lot of already made foods, and also to use chik filet chicken in recipes...There are some recipes that can be found on the foodnetwork site...I don't really understand the idea behind the book...Save your monies people..."
5,I love this cookbook!!,"I really like all of Paula Deen's cookbooks, but I especially love this one. I've made several of the recipes (as I have out of all her cookbooks) and they're all *GREAT*!! Her recipes call for normal, everyday ingredients that most people either already have in their cabinet or know exactly where to find them at the grocery store. I also just love to sit down with this book and just *read* it...it's very entertaining...just like her show on the Food Network. I highly recommend this book!!!"
2,Not as good as you might think,"I was given this book for Christmas. I always try and make at least two or more recipes when I get a new cookbook. I am not a chef but I am a very good cook and can execute a fairly difficult recipe. I hate to burst everyone's bubble but this book contains recipes based on canned soups and when they are not the recipes are flavorless. I made the shrimp casserole, shrimp and grits and the oatmeal cookies. Nothing to write home about. I will say if you are a beginner this may be beneficial. A lot of hype."
3,Good but not her best,"This is Paula Deen's first cookbook that gets the ""star treatment"" - nice hardcover, beautiful color photos of some of the mouth-watering menus, and a nice format. She has arrived! However, I don't think it is necessarily her best content-wise. Her previous books, the little paperback editions with the plastic ring binders, have far more recipes and feel more ""intimate,"" if there is such a thing with a cookbook! This book features sample party menus and have titles like ""A Bridge Club Supper"" and ""A Georgia Bulldawg Parking Lot Tailgate."" Most of these feature a main entree, a few side dishes, an appetizer or two and a dessert. The chocolate sandwich cookies (on page 94) and the pimento cheese spread (page 40) are two recipes that are delicious and very easy to make. Some of the recipes, including the chocolate sandwich cookies, didn't originate with Paula and she says so in the introductions to the menus."
5,great great book,This is one of my favorites cooking book. I have made most of the recipes in this book and they are just amazing! I also have Simple and Simply Delicious by Sylvie Rocher .I will recommend both of those books
3,"Paul Deen is a good southern cook, but...","Paula Deen is a good southern cook, but I was a little disappointed with this offering. It doesn't seem to live up to her other products. Maybe it is because that I don't entertain much, and certainly not in a formal way, but this doesn't fit our lifestyle or cooking preferences."
4,Lots of enjoyable recipes...,"We love her cooking especially my hubby and I'm looking forward to see her next cook-book.A cookbook to buy, u wan't be disappointed.This is a great cookbook if you want good, but not complicated recipes. The Not Yo Mamma's Banana puding is so good and so easy. The book is charming as is it's author. I plan on trying many of the recipes. The only thing was not many pictures i like so see what I'm preparing.Thanks, and enjoy!"
2,not what I expected,"I found the recipes in this book extremely uneven. I don't feel a cookbook has to have long, difficult recipes using unusual ingredients to be good, and many of these recipes are nice and simple (some perhaps too simple for my tastes.) Other recipes seemed a little too exotic, like the author was try to appeal to too wide of an audience.For the curious, do like I did and check the item out at your local library before dropping your hard earned money."
3,A bit slow,"It took a while to get the item, possibly problems due to the holidays, however it was packaged great and just what I had ordered."
2,When will Southern food be what it should be?,"I like Paula Deen, and I like some of her recipes. But, being a Southerner, I'm disappointed that so many popular Southern food writers continue act like they're cooking in the 50s -- taking shortcuts with processed added foods. Lots of Southern writers have resurrected and refined our traditions -- especially in New Orleans and in ""low country"" cooking. Paula Deen and her bandwagon act like none of that has happened. It's time for Southern cooks to throw away their canned mushroom soup, instant puddings, and hot-rise cornbread mixes. And start making desserts that actually taste like something other than pure sweetness, i.e., stop using mind-numbing amounts of sugar. Lots of this stuff used to be considered truck stop food (I'm especially thinking of the desserts here); now, it's becoming known solely as Southern food."
3,I wasn't that happy with this product. It ...,I wasn't that happy with this product. It didn't go on smoothly and I felt like I needed more deodorant around the middle of the afternoon. The only thing I liked was the scent.
2,Jess Perfume,"The bottle was so tiny you can only use it twice. I didnt realize it was a mini and this small, even for the price I think they could have came up with a decent size, but other than that I received product in a timely manner upon ordering."
3,Jess,"I had received a bottle of Jess as a present many years ago and had been looking to replace it for some time but was unable tofind it in any of the local stores. So when I found it on the internet was elated but unwilling to spend the purchase price for a large bottle without trying it again to see if the scent was as I remembered. It was not. Although I enjoyed the very mild scent, I would not purchase the normal size bottle."
4,Nice CD offering a sample of a lot of peices,"If you're looking for full pieces, look at other CDs. This one gives relatively small offerings of various pieces, which is awesome if you're just trying to listen to a bunch of selections in hopes of finding the 'right' one. Check it out if you have a wedding on the horizon, need to pick a piece for your wedding, and have $10 to spare."
2,This is not a book to learn by,"The reviewer no one is paying attention to is the more correct one. This book is full of small photos taken during the completion of larger works. Accompanying these photos are plenty of comments, but they are NOT detailed instruction or guidance that will help if you are learning - only generalizations, broad concepts, wishy washy artsy fluff. Don't buy this book to learn to paint shiny objects, fur, cloth or folds, or any other specific material or texture. On the other hand, if you like Joseph Sheppard's style of painting and you can learn to paint anything simply by looking at hundreds of 2-3 inch square photos... this is the book for you."
2,I found it !!,"I, too, grew up listening to an old castte tape of this recording. I have been looking for the cd for many years. Why didn't I look for it at Amazon before ?!This is a recording that makes any moment a pleasant and joyful time. You will never stop listening to it for years and still enjoy every track as the first time. It is so light... You will also enjoy the charming sound of each instrument, and you'll shurely discover a whole new aproach to Joplin's music as a band, rather than the original piano. Of course, the piano versions stand for themselves, but the deep bass lines, the charming flutes, the rithm of drums, you could almost belive it could have originally been written for a band."
5,"A great CD, but there's another one that's even better","This was the first ragtime album put out by the NE Conservatory Ragtime Ensemble, but their second album is even better. ""The Art of the Rag"" (make sure you get the one that's all Scott Joplin). On it, the tempos are less frenetic, the performances are wonderful and the even quality of the rags themselves is higher. In particular, the Magnetic Rag and the Wall Street Rag are my favorites. Here's the Amazon link.The Art Of The Rag"
5,Great resource for anyone that wants to get a basic understanding of EE,"My background is Mechanical Engineering and I found this book to be extremely useful and interesting. I purchased this book in order to get a better understanding of the EE basics. Like most universities a ME takes a EE 101 course that is essentially a weed out course. The problem with a weed out course is that in the end you don't have a solid understanding of what the underlying basics are. If this sounds familiar, you should definitely buy this book.The author (Darren Ashby) addresses this concern. This book is full of schematics and there are often various relationships made between the Electrical/Mechanical disciplines which are very useful. This book also includes a useful CD-ROM that contains a ""Rule of Thumb"" reference guide, an ""Equations Reference"" guide as well as some other useful tools/calculators.Highly recommend."
3,Ok,I was hoping that this book would help me understand some of my sticking points a little better. However I found that it was more a refresher on things you already know but want to understand a bit better. So this book won't help with things you never really got in the first place or don't know anything about now. I found better explanations doing searches for specifics on google.
2,"I wanted to like this book, but ...","I used to design circuits years ago and wanted a refresher for some aspects that I'd forgotten because I'm back into circuit design. I picked up this book hoping for a good refresher. Both the reader reviews and my initial scan of the book made it look promising.But, after slogging through mis-spellings galore, an unclear writing style, sentences obviously missing key words, ambiguous sentences, etc, I gave up. After all, if I have to dig through the language to get to the message, I may as well go with a book that's deeper in the subject because I would get more information for the same effort.I place responsibility for the poor quality on the publisher and editor(s) more than on the author. The publisher's job is to take a manuscript draft and turn it into a polished product to offer to the public. In this the publisher failed miserably."
3,Mozart sonata for 2 Pianos in D & Schubert Fantasia for Piano 4 hands in F Minor,"I have many old recordings by Murray Perahia, but I am disappointed with the performance in this recording. The Schubert piece is played so slow that I felt it lost its spirit. I first became aware of the Fantasia in the movie Madame Suzatska, and I have since listened to other recordings on YOU TUBE that were better than in this recording in my opinion."
3,Slow and Ruminative Schubert,"This is a thoughtful, but slow and ruminative, performance of Schubert's masterpiece that captures much of its beauty but misses the storm and stress. Richter and Britten provide even more nuanced phrasing and have the power for the climaxes.I haven't heard the Mozart on this disk--have only downloaded the Schubert."
2,Surprised,"Being that this is a 'Heininger' product, I was greatly surprised to learn that it was NOT an ""anti-wobble' lock. What a waste it's been for us to drive around watching our Heininger 4-bike rack (I must say, the rack itself is VERY HIGH QUALITY) wobble around as we drive. What's the point of even selling a lock if it's not anti-wobble? So, off I go, seeking now locally a true anti-wobble lock, having close to wasted $29.00. Sorry, but it's true."
5,Works as expected,"I purchased the Heininger 6000 extension and 6001 threaded hitch lock at the same time. I have not test drove it yet, but it seems to accomplish what I wanted. My bike rack now fits on my Wrangler with room to spare clearing the 12.5in wide spare on the back. I really like having more than one pin location.I was not sure if the lock thread would fit with the extension, but it does. Despite the very little clearance available around my hitch, I did get it to fit and lock. I had to insert it from the left as the hitch wire harness connection interfered with the lock when inserted from the right. I also discovered that the hitch lock on my 2in receiver Yakima rack fits the same threads as well. I may have purchased another one of these instead had I known. It would be nice to just have one key for everything.The only downside I encountered was that 6001 and 6000 were not in stock together, meaning I had to pay for shipping on both from two different Amazon affiliates."
5,Lock Down Bike Rack,"This does the job perfectly. It is worth every penny. You must have this!!Yes, you must purchase this locking trailer hitch to do the following:- Lock you bike rack to prevent theft and- This ""screw-in"" bolt, keeps your bike rack from wabbeling back and forth. Withoutthis ""screw-in"" feature your rack will sway as you drive and possibly cause shiftingin your bikes and possibly even shake a bike loose. Be sure to secure all bikes withbungy chords in addition to the racks rubber straping."
2,Pretty but...,Very pretty and comfortable but the toggle is not a good fit and it falls off my wrist. I have many toggle type bracelts and this is the only one I cannot wear. If it hadn't fallen off where it was noticeable I would have lost it. So now it sits in my jewelry box and cannot be worn. Very disappointing that I will have to pay to have it made to fasten securely or just quit wearing it. Bummer!
5,it's as good as allclad. for real...but read on please,"But even allclad is just pots and pans. Yea I know it's heavy duty& will last a life time though and so pretty and shiny. What kills me is leading people to believe that commercial kitchens use stuff like this. If you want well made inexpensive commercial equipment go to a warehouse club or a restaurant supply company. If you want well made, shiny, expensive and best of all impressive to your cheapskate friends buy this or allclad. I do own this whole set and love it but I got it for 75% off on clearance. I also own some cheap heavy commercial cookware that I got at Sams Club and I like it too. Oh yea, this is not the same as the cheap, thin new line that Cuisinart has put out the last few years."
1,bad rain gauge and thermometer,"Received a W&P; rain gauge and thermometer for Father's Day 2010.The rain gauge cracked the first time below 32 degrees and the thermometer is off 18 degrees.This company appears to sell absolute garbage, most likely cheap foreign made."
2,Ligth pen,"ok product, the batteries that come with it dont work, so you have to get new ones, nice light for writing in the dark, the pen it self is ok, could be better."
3,light pen,"well, I really liked the pen the first time I used it. about 2wks went by and I needed it again and the batteries were dead! It's new! Kind of irritating. The pen is great to use other wise."
1,"Good price, poor quality",I've gone through 2 of these in less than a year. The plastic screw-cap that contains the battery is especially fragile and will break easily if dropped even on a soft surface. The ink cartridge is modified slightly so you can't use generic refills and have to order through the manufacturer's website.
2,get what you pay for,cheap. top had to be glued upon arrival. light is too bright to use to do movie critiques/reviews. but it does work well for a pen light. just would be better if a red light as bright green light.
4,Pen light,"I found this pen light to be very useful when working in a dark room and having to take notes. The soft green light provided ample light to write and read without being a distraction to others. The light is turned on/off by rotating a well-designed rubberized switch which also acts as the finger grip for writing. Two watch type batteries provide power and are easily accessible to replace. Ergonomically, the pen feels a bit over-sized and the ballpoint writes adequately - could be better. The only real negative I found was the clear plastic cap which is used to cover the ball point and act as a pocket holder. This cap is designed to fit on the opposite end when the pen is in use, however the cap doesn't fit snugly and can be easily lost. Other than that I thought the price of the pen was very reasonable (cheap~$4); however, s/h was three times that of the pen!"
2,Slightly Inconvenient,"This lighted (green) pen meets my expectations with one disappointment: From online illustrations, it would appear that one just pushes the button at end of pen to have the green night light come on. Unfortunately in reality, user must first remove the cap to the pen, then turn the whole pen to switch on the light. This is not easily done with one free hand. Though this is not enough to have me return the item, I am disappointed for this inconvenience that will undoubtedly slow my immediate use of the pen in the dark, under stressful conditions.[Have since, decided to return this pen...In addition to earlier comments, please note that the ""pen"" for this lighted pen is of poor quality with intermittent successful use. Very frustrating.]"
1,Junk,"Ink ran out quickly, batteries as well. Plastic that pen is made with is of poor quality- threads where you screw in the batteries stripped (on both that I bought). Horrible and flimsy."
3,"Ink not flow, on-off flaky","Pen is OK but the ink consistently doesn't flow until scribbled elsewhere. On-Off is flaky, sometimes needing several twists to get to stay on.Weems, you can do better"
2,Good light - poor pen,"It won't write well on ANY surface - I've tried to use it on multiple occasions on multiple surfaces but usually, after a few tries, I get fed up, grab another pen and just use the light while I write with something else. I replaced the item when I accidentally smashed it and thought the new one would be better/different, but no dice... poor writing quality and sometimes no writing at all due to poor product/ink cartridge, etc.What a waste. (and I still haven't found a pen with a built in light that's decent and not insanely expensive :( )"
4,"They're fine, but becare of mixing different organizer products","These tabbed dividers were just what I was looking for. However, I didn't realize that the width of the divider may be different than the width of the pages in my Franklin Covey day planner. So, once I installed the dividers I found that the tab, which is supposed to be highly visible to make things easier to find, was completely covered by the other pages. Therefore they didn't do what I wanted them to do. Not Day-Timers fault at all.No problem for the rating, the dividers are fine, just not really working for me."
2,Cracker crumbles,"Packages arrived quickly and product was fresh; HOWEVER, I really didn't need boxes of cracker crumbs, and that's what arrived."
1,Not good quality,This product came broken on one of the handles. It is very flimsy and cheap. It is also very small and cannot be used for large wood chips. I would not recommend this product at all and neither would the person I bought it for.
3,Whispers. From Dean Koontz.,"This is one the first big seller of Dean Koontz and his style andtype of characters we now encounter in his most recent books are starting to be noticeable. There is no 'magic' in this book, or there is no 'paranormal' stuff. The story strangely seems over before it starts, but then the mystery develops itself. I think this mystery is nothing of brain surgery, but as with his recent works Dean Koontz is more about the story than the ending. I am a regular reader of his works because of the journey, not because of the endings."
4,Not a bad read...,"It was a little ahrder to get into thsi book, then i expected. i mean it starts off very fast paced, I mean a pshyco tried to rape and kil la girl all in the 1st few pages but then it drags on a little too long, and is overdescriptive. The book picks u pa little later on, it si definately eerie, and its' one when your halfway thru then it's a pageturner and you can't put it down. I might read it again in a few years, it is a good book, and has an eerie ending. It might be a good book for someone to read, who had a bad childhook, because that seems to be the theme here. A nice read. Considering that thsi is one of his earlier novels, it's very good."
3,too long for its own good,"ive been lookin for an ACTUAL scary book for quite a while now, and i havnt found one yet...the only reason this stayed with me for a little while is because i have the habit of puting myself in the characters position and i ended up feeling really bad for the killer guy,{because of his childhood} i thought he was the only likeable character {for some reason} the other main characters {as important as they were} i thought they were annoying and in the way, and i didnt care about them at all. The ending was pretty disapointing {considering who my fav. character was}.....But i think my favorite part of the book is how the author made me feel sorry for the bad guy and hope the best for him...{i dunno if other people who read this book felt sorry for him...maybe im just a freak}MORAL...this is not scary...its just OK...and the author should have just shaved it down to around 300 pages, 500 pages is too much for this book, cuz it gets too boring sometimes"
3,Excellent,Whispers was an excellent book in my opinion. Hilary Thomas was a believable character even if her story line was not. The mystery of Bruno Frye kept me wondering the whole time until it was solved and the answer was right in front of me. And the romance also helped keep the humanity in the storyline.
1,A biiiig yawn...,"Whispers, what a good name for a horror book! Isn't it? or is it? I bought the book based on the blurb on the backcover:a spine tingling journey. I don't know about the journey but my spine tingled with boredom and an anger to myself...This was my first Koontz and if it wasn't Winter Moon for a second book, I would quit him for eternity. Talk about wooden characters...talk about ""witty"" dialogues...talk about white cop-black cop, friends...talk about mystery and non story action.pffff..."
3,"Good, but not memorable","This book was fast-paced, interesting, and suspenseful, but it's not memorable. In fact, I had to use amazon's ""look inside the book"" to read a few pages to be sure I had actually read this one.I remember this book being a page-turner; 3 stars for that. I don't remember the villain's intended victim at all; -2 stars for that. All in all, I'd call this a good light read--excellent for beaches, plane trips, car rides, or any occasion where you need a book that won't sap a lot of your energy (in terms of concentration; it's easy to stay focused on this one, but you won't find yourself re-reading lines to be sure you've gleaned every bit of juicy, glorious detail)."
5,Why I started reading Koontz,"I read this book years and years ago...and loved it! It was so different from anything Id read prior. Then, I loaned it to someone (damn you Carolyn! I KNOW you have it!). I have looked at yard sales, etc. and never found another copy...recieveing this book was a deja vu for me..I have read most all of his books...some get a lil far out there..but always imaginative and page turners.SOoOO now, Ive got a new copy..and my sister asked to borrow it...LOL...I think Ill just buy her a copy too..NO! You cannot borrow my book :-P"
1,uuumm whispers can be deceiving!,"You know I am really dissapointed with this one! I think Dean Koonts is a great writer, but it is like he started this book without a deadline, and then ended it with one. The story line is really easy to figure out, after reading most of it. You really don't need the ending for this one. Anyways it is too far fetch and not a good read! I wouldn't reccomend this to anyone!"
5,interesting book,"Considering it was written in 1979, the book has a very intriguing and original plot. However, I wish it had a supernatural explanation instead of rational."
5,True to Life,"A realistic look into the life of a battered woman, you'll be wishing the characters made different choices. However, their decisions are what make this story so true to life."
3,Not his better work,"I have been an avid Koontz fan for about 13 years, and I have always loved his work. His style of writing is such that you are usually unable to put his books down. However, I found ""Whispers"" to be somewhat lacking. I believe that is because his writing is, as a rule, so masterful that I have come to expect so much from him. While ""Whispers does not, I believe,touch his normal writing, it is still well writen and very suspenseful. I continue to anxisouly await his next book."
2,Whispers,"I thought this book would never end, the only thing I like was part of the ending, however at the same time other aspects of the ending were a let down, Could not stand the protagonists, half way through started rooting for the antagonist"
2,Way too long! Not one of his best efforts.,"I am a great fan of Dean Koontz. I've read about a dozen of his books and intend to tackle all of them eventually. This work, however, is way too long. I gave up about 3/4 of the way through it. It is just too repetitive. Another thing about this book that is a little off-putting is that Koontz can't seem to make-up his mind if he's writing a suspense novel or soft-core porn. I'm not a prude - far from it, but this novel needs a picture of Fabio ripping a bodice on the cover."
5,Page-turner,"just when you think you're safe...this book keeps you on the edge of your seat and guessing what's around the next corner. hilary thomas is a strong female character who takes care of herself, even when confronted with quite the adversary (and an interesting one). just when she thinks she's out of the woods, though, she finds that she's wrong. this is one of the most riveting of koontz's novels, in my opinion, because the reader is left not only wondering what will happen next but why it's happening. thankfully, the answers are there eventually."
3,this book is good reading for your enjoyment. v.casas,this book does not compare with others from mr. koontz books how ever this book is good for reading after you have read his other explicit books.........v.casas
3,Average quality on the Koontz spectrum,"A good story with engaging characters, but not one of his best. Read it eventually if you're a fan, but not before ""The Bad Place"" or ""Hideaway""."
3,Fair read...but not great.,"1) CON: The first hint at anything strange doesn't happen until page 190ish2) CON: First actual scene where something strange is reveled didn't come unti pg 270ish out of 500. Until this scene Koontz is just building a foundation for us care about the characters3) CON: Koontz seems to take a LONG time to build our concern for the characters vs other stories of his he is able to establish our emotional attachment a lot, lot sooner.4) PRO: The relationship between the ""buddy"" cops is well done and a nice twist5) PRO: He actually takes a lot of pages to establish the growing love between two characters. Thus, when the characters say the magical three words it is believable unlike many stories where such a things are rushed and full of disbelief6) PRO: As usual Koontz finds a new twist in creating a phsycotic bad guy"
2,I expected so much more,"This was my first DK book i ever read. i am a huge fan of C. Pike and was expecting so much more, this wasnt even a horror story it was more of a crime story thats has a psychotic with an unusual past. And a lot of it was easy to figure out anyways, ill try reading some others of his, and maybe theyll be better, it was a fast and easy read so i got done with it fast, that was the only great thing about it!!! If you want a REAL horror story try THE SEASON OF PASSAGE."
3,The pros don't really outweigh the cons,"This book is another mediocre work from Koontz. I enjoy his writing style, but the plot is flat and the story is very predictable and ends abruptly (like most of his novels). My main complaint with the book though, is that the characters simply do not act like normal people would. Its not all bad though. The ideas about abuse and the mystery of Bruno Frye are quite interesting, but I can only recommend this book if you have enjoyed other Koontz novels."
2,"all right, i accept this","this book is to my knowledge koontz masterpiece. that's right, i don't care for the guy. but i don't hate this. i accept the plot (for once), though simple it is. it is exposed ok. a woman is being attacked. noone (but one, koontz, please)believes her. the matter turns out to be graver than first thought. two details (the abuse, ""the whispers"") are carried out good. but as always with koontz the story is merred by a disgusting sentimentality which is more likely to touch your stomach than your heart. lot of irrelevant stuff, especially about the police officer's partner. i've never found koontz' characters to be so sympathetic as people claim. if you manage to forget about your best friend during one lousy flight, you're worse than most."
1,Oh Sweet Jesus!,"This is the worst book I have read in ten, fifteen, twenty, thirty...whatever-you-say years. Characters are not cardboards-ironboards, dialogues come in chunks and my three-year-old baby speaks more coherently. There is some plot among all the junk here but D. Koontz is so inadept in telling it I wanted to call him and tell how a good writing should be-- me, a housewife witha fourteen-year graduate of college...Skip this and read James Patterson. D. Koontz does not know how to write. It is that simple."
5,Horrible... but amazing. Couldn't put it down!,I read this book not knowing a lot about Dean Koontz. This story is horrible. What I mean is the details of the story are horrible. The book is one of the best written stories I've ever read. I couldn't put it down. I was so intrigued by what was going on. I HAD to know what happened. I would try to explain to people the details of the story and most people looked at me like I was crazy and asked why I was reading the book. Even years later when I explain it to people they think it is messed up. But that's part of what made it so good. I couldn't stop thinking about it. And I was caught completely by surprise by several events in the book. I recommend this to anyone who isn't easily turned off by things. In the end it all makes sense. This is an amazing book.
2,an early work,"This is a horror/supernatural thriller that is an early work and it shows. I like the author but this book is incredibly violent, has mental illness galore, and tons of inflated monolog and dialog. An ok work to review for the fans, one to skip for the others."
5,Excellent. Probably the best Koontz book I have ever read!,"I agree with the review from September '04. I read this book some time ago, but sheesh...it was excellent. The villian in that novel scared me. The real cause of the whispers...wait until you find that one out - you will not be disappointed.Koontz really hit a home run with this novel!Congrats on this book to Mr. Koontz."
4,Koontz Fan,"Whispers was a real page-turner. The violence and sex were more vividly described than I like, but the story was great."
4,one of his best,"i have read many of mr. koontz works, this book and ""Door to december"" are two of my most cherished. I read it the first time three years ago and many more times since then. The way mr. koontz delves into the mind is remarkable ."
5,GAVE ME CHILLS,This book was the first one I ever read by Dean Koontz. It turned me into a major Koontz fan. This was an incredible book. It was freaky because what happened can happen to anyone.
4,It's a doosie!!,"Whispers.... even the mention of the name gives me shivers and goosebumps. A really great book, with the right amount of horror, and a splash of EWWWWW to top it off. One of my first Koontz books - always will be one of my favorites (right behind Watchers and Strangers)."
5,I love reading Dean Koontz but this is his BEST,This book is by far the best Dean Koontz I have ever read. I simply couldn't put it down. Many times I had to re-read the words just to make sure that what I thought I was reading in the book was actually happening. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves books with dark twists.
1,Cheap and defective.,"I received this keyboard today and I'm returning it. The escape key and the spacebar are very wobbly. The A through G keys are completely non-functional, as is one of the volume keys. Too bad, because I like the simple look of the keyboard, and the USB ports are very nice.This product is cheaply made. Avoid it."
3,Quick! But accurate?,"This book travels well and with the index dog-eared makes for quick and dirty referencing (espeically of Fam Graminae).But I found a few of the plates, although well illustrated, confusing (i.e. determining the key number associated with the image of a particular flowering head). If you are looking for a thorough reference for Genus Carex don't look here."
3,alright,"Great black and white drawings depicting the most abundant species although they only go into descriptions for the more rare species.Good price, good on grasses less on sedges and rushs."
3,"Good, needs compliment","Helped me a lot, but mostly as a compliment to Lauren Brown's Grass ID guide. This one is more technical and has fewer descriptions, but more species."
3,Good book. Great sketches,"Decent book, the sketches are very helpful for attempting to key out species."
3,Basic!,"This book is very basic and doesn't give much if you are not familiar with the terminology used for grasses, sedges and rushes. Has a basic key to seperate the grasses, sedges and rushes and then a more detailed key for the Graminae, which leads you to plates of specific species (has common names too) with okay line drawings that can be confusing on occasion. Otherwise, may help the amature and/or botanist looking for a complementary guide for other references."
5,"Easy recipes, fantastic tastes","Was initially skeptical of a cookbook that didn't have any pictures of the dish I was preparing, however, was pleasantly surprised to find that all of the recipes were easy to make and downright delicious! Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys cooking, wants to go vegetarian, and can withstand spice."
4,A masterful selection,"A friend recommended this book to me and I also read about it on one of the Indian websites. Just thought you might be also be interested to read this review from RecipeDelights.com-This is Julie Sahni's second long awaited book after Classic Indian Cooking. A must-have for vegetarians, it explores the riches of India's vegetarian and grain cooking. It begins with a simple explanation of the ingredients and techniques characteristic of this cuisine. She goes on to describe every classical blend of curry in the Indian tradition, with accompanying recipes on how to use them. A masterful selection of India's vegetarian cuisine- from delicate curries to fiery hot dals- all healthful and delicious."
4,A useful addition to your vegetarian collection,"This is my second favorite Indian cookbook (I think the best is by Yamuna Devi). Some recipes are disappointing (only 4 stars...). BUT a few of them are absolute jewels (Blue Mountain cabbage, turnip and orange rice, for example). Get this book just for those, they are worth it."
5,THE BEST INDIAN COOKBOOK,"I am an Indian and a new housewife. I borrowed this book, since I am a vegeratian, two years ago from the library and tried some of the dishes. My husband since then has become a big fan of Ms. Sahni. Recently I purchased this book and love it. My mother who has been cooking for 45 years has made me buy her a copy too. I am sending my sister a copy in India. Imagine my surprise(pleasantly)when I saw Julie Sahni on TV on 'Cooking Live'!! It was a pleasure to watch her simple and elegant style compared to the pompous style of Ms. Jaffrey. Thank you Ms. Sahni for all the lovely recipes. P.S. I love sabzi dhan shak, vangi bhat and khatti bhaji the best."
4,A method for Indian Cuisine,"Julie Sahni has proven herself to be an ingenious cook. Her adaptations of classic Indian fare for western vegetable, corn, and bean varities was nothing short of inspired. No longer will you have to struggle to find an adequate replacement for an unknown variety which may be irreplabable.She has also done a marvelous job of introducing me to a variety of Indian dishes. From the curry-laden legumes of the north to the delightfully fiery vegetables of the south, these recipes are both easy to reporduce and quite enjoyable to eat. her introduction to most of the ingredients and methods used were also remarkably helpful. This book is more of a method for Indian cuisine that a collection of recipes. I recommend it for anybody interested in the subject."
4,"good book, but a few pages short of the record","This book is a great history of McGwires baseball career, but I think in the interest to speed up the production of this book it end too quickly. By the time it is published the record was broken but it's not in the book. Nice to read about what leads up to the record however. All baseball players should read this to see the kind of man a professional should be. McGwire is a true roll modle not just a "" Home Run Hero"""
4,Simply amazing bio on big Mac!,"This book is a very intersting book on mcgwire growing up to being all the way where he is now in the majors. I reccomend this book to all McGwire fans, and it is full of information of all sorts on him. This is one good biography."
5,My Favorite Book,"I too read this as a kid ,an adult,and now as a senior and I keep reading it.A great family story,a story about teamwork and how hard work really does pay off.5 stars!"
2,TERRIBLE to assemble!,"I don't mind assembling things, but this was so poorly made it was a nightmare! The holes were not pre-drilled in many places, the paint chipped off, there were a lot of imperfections that had been poorly patched, the wood was split on the main right side of the unit. There were cheap plastic pieces to screw into the wood for anchors to other pieces and I could barely force them to fit so I could start turning them into the holes (note - have pliers handy, impossible to do otherwise). Overall, it is the size I wanted (extended changing area with drawers/cupboard area) so I am satisfied that I found what I wanted on Amazon, but the manufacturer has some quality problems to correct. Directions noted 1 hour to assemble, I'd say more like 5 hours with 2 people working on it."
3,Nice Gym for the Price,The color of the gym that I received was different from what was pictured. I got a purple gym with three hang stars rather than what was shown. I was a bit disappointed by the color since purple seemed girly for my son. Other than that it was a good value for the price. Note that this gym takes a LONG time to blow up and I would not suggest doing it by mouth (it can take hours). Make sure you have a power pump of some sort.
3,Great if it doesn't get a hole it it.,Ours got a hole in it quite early. I bought it for my son's 1st birthday party. So it's fine as long as you are extra gentle. My son loved it before the leak killed it.
3,Take some getting use to,Grandson didn't like this at first but after sitting in the livingroom for a few months he fell in love with it but only if I let the air out of the top ring so he could get in and out on his own.
1,No fun for little ones!!,"I have 2 boys, age 3-1/2 and 1 year. I bought this thinking not only would it help to keep my 1 year old busy in one spot, but he could fall and not get hurt. Well, my 1 year old wants NOTHING to do with it and my 3-1/2 year old jumped in and popped the bottom within 30 minutes of having it!! So, now the squeekers on the bottom won't work and there is nothing more to entice my 1 year old...he sits in it and screams. No fun for little ones!!!!"
2,Not a favorite toy:-(,"We bought this for my daughter's first birthday, and filled it with balls. She went in it for about a day but wasn't wild about it, then cried whenever we put her in it. Might try it again this summer filled with water. i was disappointed, but have talked to other parents whose kids have not loved these. So maybe try one at McDonalds or something before making the investment. Just a thought."
1,Smells horrible!!,This toy smells so strongly of plasic that I only allowed my son in it for a few minutes. I could not stand it in my house. We left it outside to see if it would air out and it never did...we even washed it b/c it had white powder all over it. I would not recommend this purchase.
3,"baby got used to it, but mom liked it!","When we first introduced this ""gym"", our daughter took a little while getting used to it. It became more of a confined play area for her while we worked inside while keeping an eye on her.She didn't like the idea of being separated from us. But every child is different. She was able to wiggle her way out of it, and didn't find the hanging toys amusing- just in the way. I think if we were to bu0y the balls with it, this toy would be much more enjoyable."
3,BOUNCE,"I bought this for my grandaughter. She enjoys playing in it with balls, although she didn't like it with the high sides inflated. So we just have the bottom ring inflated and she can climb in and out by herself."
3,BOUNCY GYM,NICE PRODUCT BUT BE CAREFUL WHO YOU BUY FROM IT COST ME MORE IN SHIPPING THEN FOR THE PRODUCT.
2,Never liked it,"Our daughter became this as she was a baby. We tried several time during her past 2 years if she would reach a moment to like it, but she always wanted to go out after 1 or 2 minutes. Maybe other babies are diferent, but I think its not the right material for such a playground. For a hot environment like ours in the south, it quickly gets very hot inside and you can not leave your baby or little child alone playing because of the plastic material that can be dangerous. We finally sealed the holes on the bottom and do not pump up the upper part so we fill it with water and use it as a litle pool, thats the only way for us to use it."
2,stinky plastic,"plastic is cold in the winter and it still stank. if the baby spits up (or other bodily functions should leak) all the little creases become tiny rivers and it's a pain to get them cleaned out. her brother, one year older, got into it and caused it to spring a leak. don't even try to patch it."
1,my nu-wave oven is looking sad,"for the first few months it was an excellent product, but it soon becomes obvious that the parts are so poorly made that they disintegrate, leaving the product dangerous to use, and when sourcing spare parts, it proves very difficult, so far waiting 3 1/2 months and still no further forward."
2,junk,"I bought my Nuwave from the website and after trying it for a month, mine is going back for a refund. I did country style ribs from frozen and it took 80 minutes, but the outside started to char before the inside was done. I did a seven pound pork roast and after 5 hours, I ended up slicing it up and cooking the slices. I can do a roast in the slow cooker quicker. Did a whole chicken to their time specified and it was still blood red at the bone."
3,Buyer Beware!,"I have been using the NuWave Oven Pro for a couple of years. I use it everyday and love the way it cooks meats - especially frozen meats. The only problem I have had with it is the plastic dome cracks during cooking. I'm on my third dome. But the reason I'm disappointed is there is no customer support. Recently, I ordered two domes and the reversible cooking rack. I received the domes but not the cooking rack. The enclosed invoiced showed I had been billed for it. I have called the customer support number every day for a week, left several specific messages, and sent two emails. None of my calls or emails were responded to, nor have I received the rack. I can no longer recommend this product."
2,Yikes!,"Ok I must be missing something. I bought this comb based on the positive reviews. I guess 'fuzz balls' and 'sweater pills' must be two different things. I bought it for sweater pills. When i received it I thought wow, that thing is sharp & looks like it would tear my husbands nice sweaters to shreds. I barely touched it to a sweater & the teeth stuck & snagged. I previously had a fabric shaver which was battery opperated & it worked great for pills, when it broke I searched online & came upon this comb. I actually had another battery shaver in my cart along with this comb, but it sounded great being able to save money on batteries & lint roller refills so I ended up just buying this. It'll work fine on my heavy duty items like bath towels when they get really linty, but I don't get how folks are using it on their sweaters."
3,Works ok,"If you're doing a large job or several sweaters, this thing is time consuming & messy. The fuzz balls stick inside the comb groves & must be constantly ""pulled/picked out"", as well as cleaned up from your garmet.I'd save your $ on this thing & buy the Fuzz Wizard instead http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YAAGX2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title . I've tried several pilling shavers & hands down -- the fuzz wizard is the best!! (easy to use, clean, etc.)."
3,"Amazing, when it stays in one piece","This comb is the bomb for removing fuzzies. It takes a little work, and you definitely need to deploy a lint roller and vacuum cleaner when you're done, but it does wonders. I can definitely get one more season out of my winter coat and several sweaters where as before they were headed to goodwill. But, the comb falls apart SO easily. I've used it twice and super glued it back together twice. I know this is a cheap item, but it shouldn't be quite that disposable."
4,Does the job,"Did what it was made to do.The one I received was a no name brand comb, it was not De-Fuzz brand but it still worked like a charm."
3,it does remove fuzz,"this is a good product but overpriced for what it is... you can use a piece of sand paper to do the same job, however this product has a nice shape that is easy to hold while you're using it..."
1,waste of money,"I bought the hoverdisc for my son's 5th b-day, he went to play with his friends and it lasted all but 5 minutes. It is a good idea, but they didn't think of durability (who would think that mylar balloon material would last anyway?) when they made this product. (...)"
3,fun if you fill it with helium,"I bought this for my son who is 7 and I took it home and just filled it with air. If you just fill it with air it really does not do anything, you can throw it but it does not float. If you have access to helium it would probably be a fun toy, I would recommened only filling this with helium in order for your child to have fun with this toy."
4,Excellent fun for my 4 year old!,"My son recieved this as a gift and and we tossed it for about an hour in our grassy backyard this afternoon. (I was checking the site to see where I could buy another one for other kids.) It got stuck in the tree twice, and didn't pop...plus, my son didn't pounce on it, which is pretty amazing, since he pounces on EVERYTHING. I will admit that I don't have high expectations on its durability. I'd still buy another pricy balloon. Can't wait to play more tomorrow!"
5,Great,"Easy to understand, covered everything I had questions about. I would recommend this if you are considering starting in beekeeping"
1,Money could have been better spent,"Money could have been better spent, over priced for content. Any number of more informative books are out there, suspect the one dor dummies might be better."
5,Great service!,"Only problem I had was the fit. Wish they would let people know to make sure to order the next size up. I had issues with the boots. It wasn't the dealer, but my own fault I didn't go to a real store and try some on to figure out the size I needed. These must be sold out. I couldn't post a link to the boots I bought. Sorry."
2,Way overpriced!!,I purchased this lamp for my grandson - only because he absolutely loves dinosaurs and he needed a new lamp for his room. It is totally overpriced - should be more like $20.00. The lampshade is dark green and offers very little light. This was a disappointment - I am going to buy a light shade for the lamp - so that kicks the price up even more. This is not a good thing!
5,Perfect start to Spanish,I recently decided to learn Spanish. I did a lot of research and there are a lot of products for learning Spanish as I'm sure you know if your reading this.I purchase the download version I this and I have to say its exactly what I was looking for. The voices are clear and each lesson gives you plenty to focus on. They also gave a lot of bonus material which is a whole nother series of lessons. The owner of LSLC sends emails every week with more lessons which is really coolI am currently in lesson 12 and am already grasping more Spanish then I thought. Watching tv or what not I'm hearing words and phrases and picking up on it!I will deffinetly be purchasing all LSLC has to offer . I know you will too
3,Not every day spanish!,"First I did all three levels of Pimsleur and liked it but wished there was a 4th and 5th level.So I tried this and found it to be a pale imitation!The most basic gripe I have is that the sentences it uses are ridiculous!""Do you sell red cars?"" ""No, I sell blue cars.""""Did your grandfather wear hats?""""Did your sister's in law wear necklaces?""The program claims to teach ""everyday spanish"" -- nope. Nobody talks like this!It really makes it difficult to focus on the material when you keep thinking ""what the heck am I saying this for?!!"""
2,Buyer beware,"You should notice something very strange about all the reviews here. They nearly ALL stop with a review up until lesson 13. I find that very interesting because something happens at lesson 13.The first 12 lessons are good, not great. I have a background in basic Spanish and thus I understood why things were conjugated the way they were. There are NO explanations provided on the cd so it is essentially rote memorization. BUT, at lesson 13, the instructor on the cd changes and the tempo and difficulty increases dramatically. In fact, even with listening to lesson 13 five times with the dialogue PRINTED off, I still could not follow along. This is because they begin speaking so fast and are using irregular verbs.Bottom line: This product is good for lessons 1-12 but is abysmal after that. Buyer beware."
2,Tedious,"Rather disappointing. Probably useful if you're taking a Spanish class, but for a traveler this is next to useless and really, really boring. I don't imagine I will ever need to say, ""Yes, I see the red cars."" Ever. Also, focusing on the familiar form of Spanish seems like a bad strategy. If you're just learning the language, how likely are you to be talking to people you know well enough to use the familiar form of address? The first CD was unplayable; and while I knew enough Spanish to skip it, I just found the subsequent lessons to be boring and not all that useful. Why not teach words and phrases you might actually use? 'Cause, no, I don't eat in the hallway, even if the cat does."
2,pathetic female voice,"I did Pimsleur first and they have the clearest voices with perfect enuciation. I found the female voice light, airy and having no volume. I've wasted so much time with the playback button trying to decipher her speach. One plus was that they did verb tenses extensively. Maybe I was spoiled by Pimsleur and if I had done LSLC first I wouldn't have this complaint. LSLC needs to put out a second edition of volume 1 where they invest in a professional speaker."
3,Good but lacking......,"This is a good, thorough and in depth product..... but, it doesnt build off each lesson consistently throughout the program. They teach on one subject in lesson 6 and you dont hear it again until lesson 25. By then, you already forgot it. I think the best way to ,have something stick is to hear a bit of it in each lesson or at least every other lesson, but not 6 or 8 lessons down the road (when you forgot it) Its like learning a math formula in one day and not seeing it again until 60 days. 9 times out of 10 you don't even remember that formula. Theres not enough consistent reviewing of previous material in each lesson to come.Other than that, it definitely covers a lot of material and points out great cultural aspects in relation to word usage."
3,Many of the agents are considered suspect,"Herman claims he included AAR members and a few other ""good literary agents."" Not all that many of those he lists are AAR members. Many are not listed in the comprehensive listing at the Preditors and Editors literary agent site. More than ten of those he lists have earned a ""not recommended"" ranking from the Preditors and Editors site because they charge fees or allegedly engage in other unsavory practices. Although there are enough good agents listed in the book to make the non-CD-rom version of the book worth the money, be sure to check the listings against the P&E list and the list of the Association of Author's Representatives (which is also available online). And remember: the listings that seem too good to be true -- those that say they're really open to unpublished authors and really want to see books that can be made into movies, etc. -- are too good to be true."
2,Don't bother. Too weak for words.,"There are better guides out there you can use to build your own lists. The software is clunky and not user friendly or flexible. Save your money. As the author of thirteen published novels and a teacher of such writers as Deborah Crombie, Milan Vessely, Viqui Litman, and Martha Moore (all of whom have books for sale on Amazon)I'm telling all my students to avoid this book."
5,Nothing like this,"If you don't know where to start looking for an agent, start here. You learn not only what they like, but what they *are* like. Information is in a Q&A format that lets agents say more than just what kind and number of books they sell. They answer questions about what kind of clients they like or dislike, and what kind of queries are most likely to succeed with them."
2,Mediocrity Pays,"You can read these sort of books morning, noon, or night. But it all comes down to one thing: integrity. And agents have little or none ... The very nature of selling a book is antithetical to artistic achievement. Just look at the trash that sells to the bovine minded public and you'll understand why Jeff Herman recommends medocrity over artistic achievement. Art is beautiful but it doesn't sell. And sell you must if you want to be the next big thing on the Times best seller list. Oprah not excluded. Baa Baa Baa"
1,TOO MANY INSIDERS BENEFIT FROM WRITERS' ETERNAL HOPE,"This and other books like it purport to help writers. It is certainly comprehensive and well done. The reality is that the gatekeepers and the keymasters of the publishing industry are publishing lots of books for writers that do not seem to advance their cause. This book looks more like an advertisement by literary agents for literary agents and editors, rather than anything that is truly meant to help the writers among us. The literati turn their noses up at most of the query letters they receive.Take a look at the responses most writers get to their queries and you will realize that the literati hold themselves to a much different and lower standard than they require of the writers who query them. This tome makes money for the insider not commensurate with what those who purchase it get in return. His rewards are orders of magnitude greater than any that can be derived by a writer purchasing this work."
4,Fits Mitsubishi Airtrek,"Used this kit to install Alpine stereo. Fitted 2001 Mitsubishi Airtrek (which is a Japanese version of 2003 Outlander) very well, but plastic quality feels a bit cheap."
1,"Oh, boy... it's a silver Clone Trooper","Hasbro has gone and done it again. After the success of their silver Darth Vader, R2-D2, and Boba Fett figures, a silver Clonetrooper was inevitable. ... Here's the thing, though, Vader and R2-D2 were silver for a reason... they both came out in 2003, which was the 25th, or SILVER anniversary of the release of Star Wars: A New Hope. Twenty-six years? That's what, linoleum? Anyway, this is one of those figures you'll likely never open up and play with, so as far as a review goes, here it is: Imagine one sneak preview Clonetrooper. Paint him silver. Stick him on an attractive black blister card reminiscent of Kenner's vintage Star Wars toys. These will undoubtedly increase in value and you'll be able to send the kids to college for what you dump it for on eBay. Me, I'd rather play with my toys."
3,Not what I expected,This toy looked like heavy plastic on the commercials. I was amazed at how flimsy the toy is when I took it out of the box. This was the one toy my 17 month old wanted for Christmas so I wasn't about to take it back. The legs are constantly falling off the potty chair. When used as a high chair it is very difficult to get the baby doll in and out. The pink thing that is used for a changing table will not stay in place. It is always sliding around and the mobile comes off very easily. The sound effects are great though. My daughter loves that part. And it is really cool how it looks like there is something coming out of the powder and lotion bottles.
3,Cute - but disappointed in the quality,"I bought this toy for my daughter for Christmas when she was 4. We also bought the bouncy chair, the doll, and the highchair. Although all were cute they are quite small and very poor quality for a name such as Fisher Price. The pink parts that make the ""crib"" continually fall off as do the legs. The highchair is pretty small and only really fits the Fisher Price doll. Other dolls are either too large or too small. The pink ""bed"" that covers the bathtub is not a secure fit and when my daughter places the doll on it, it often slips into the tub thus frustrating her because she wants to put the baby to sleep. The mobile is also continually falling off so we just removed it all together. I would have returned it but it would not be fair to my daughter. The quality needs to be a little better. I wouldn't have minded paying $10 more if the quality were better."
3,Care Center Review,"I'm a big Fisher Price/ Mattel fan, but was disappointed with this product. It's very flimsy and comes apart way too easily. The mobile is always falling apart. It's highchair/potty has a very small seat and you need really tiny dollys to put in it. On a positive note - both my four and two year old love the accessories - shampoo bottle, powder and eating items and use them with all their dolls. I'm hoping Mattel will put a sturdier, larger care center on the market soon."
3,"Its OKAY, but flimsy...","My daughter's liked the care center when we bought it for them last Christmas (At the time they were 4 and 2)but in a matter of weeks they got bored with it and ticked that it wouldnt stay up or the legs would pop off. It was very hard to get the Little Mommy dolls in and out of the highchair and the ""bed"" is a joke. I expected more out of a company like FP, but the quality is awful, the sounds are cute though. I wouldnt spend the $30 on it. We ended up throwing it away, the girls just got too frustrated with it. The Little Mommy dolls and clothing are great but I DEFINATELY DO NOT RECOMMEND their furniture line. Very flimsy and made of low quality plastic..."
3,This is a good toy,"It has so much, the sound of water when you play with the faucet, the music, mobile, potty/high chair, etc.. but the legs do come off sometimes. I wish it were more durable. However, my daughter just loves it and played with it about a year. We got it for her when she was 2....and she is just over 3.5 years now, and does not have as much interest in it. I would have expected a toy from Fisher Price to be more durable."
3,Could do better,"Nikon's current version of One Touch 90 is relatively low cost but you get what you pay for. Takes great pictures, but the mechanics for the self-opening lens are hit or miss. I've bought two of this camera in four months and have had the lens mechanism fail AGAIN. Yet my One Touch 90 bought in the early 90s lasted 10 years. To avoid this problem, I'd pay the money for the upgraded model One Touch 180."
1,THE REASON I DONT LIKE IT IS.,IT LOOKED OLD AND OUT DATED.TO LARGE.WOULD LIKE FOR IT TO SMALL ENOUGH FOR MY POCKET.HAVE NOT USED PROBABLY WANT.
5,Fall Back Down Review,"Catchy hooks--a good Rancid song. Slightly ""pop"" sounding, but still very good. I ended up buying the whole album after getting this song."
3,It is okay for the price.,It is okay for the price. A little bigger. Also a little hard in comparison to the sport visor for running.
5,Bel Ami,"wow, what a movie, very heart filled, loving, honest, aware and so in tune to ones feelings... Impressively, memorizing!A must see movie!"
3,Bel Ami,"This picture could have been Great, it just needed another Director! It could have neen more historical and more in dept in the time period."
1,Dreadful,"Robert Pattinson sinks this Guy de Maupassant adaptation, it truly doesn't matter how good his co-stars are, and honestly some of them carry their roles with aplomb, the tale of a vapid intellectual simpleton who.rises to fame solely on his looks rests solely on its lead shoulders. The directors (or more likely producers) decision to cast Rob in hopes of getting the much coveted lonely elderly women with too many cats demographic is at the cost of the quality of the film itself. Almost every scene that he's in rings false and the fact that he's supremely out of his element as to the tedious film's great source material would be laughable if it wasn't so maddening. If there were one silver lining it's that I caught this on HDnet Movies, so I didn't have to pay to watch this travesty."
4,Enjoyed it!,"I actually enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I was going too. I wish I could place it at Four and a half stars. I have watched many period pieces and all of Robert Pattinson movies and I believe that the movie was well written and the acting not just from Robert Pattinson, but Uma Thurman and Christina Ricci as well was great. If you are a Twilight Fan then first know that Robert Pattinson's character is nothing like Edward Cullen. I have to say that is one of the reasons I enjoyed the movie so much, and I say that as a die hard Twilight fan. The movie was true to the way things were back then as well as true to the book. I would recommend watching it, as someone who was not positively sure about it at first know there are no regrets here about my decision to watch the movie."
2,period piece,"it's a periud piece with a lot of notible stars, story line is ok a little too slow for me."
1,badmdatty,"I rarely dislike movies to the point that I cannot even finish them, but this is one of them. Robert Pattison's character, Bel Ami, had no redeemable qualities. Don't waste your time on this one."
1,BAD,This was a bad film with a bad script with terrible directing and the worst performance from Pattinson and Thurman that I have seen. Please do not bother.
3,Bel Ami,You only watch this because you LOVE Robert Pattinson. All the actresses do a great job. You love his character and hate him at the same time. The tape quality wasn't great. I had to tweak my sound setting several times to hear the voices. Still you have to see it if you love him!
3,Somthing different,I was just looking for something different - watched this due to the actor. filled the evening with something better than what the local chanels offered
1,Never would fully load and skipped a lot!,I never could get the movie to run completely! It kept reloading. I tried it about 10 minutes then gave up! Not worth the effort! Very disappointed!
3,OK.......,This movie was ok. Can't say that I really cared about the characters. Could have been executed with a little more finesse.
3,A bit of a disappointment,"Such a great cast! But the script left much to be desired. The plot is predictable and leaves the viewer with little to be engaged with. On a high note, the costumes and interiors were good."
3,Okay,Had high hopes with the reviews and R.P. did a wonderful job. The female characters didn't seem to have enough to work with. The whole story seemed to be shallower than it could have been.
4,Read the book first for an even better experience.,"There's been so little marketing for this movie in the U.S. (What's up with that, Magnolia Films?) that I wasn't expecting much. I rented this anyway, mostly out of curiousity and because I enjoyed the book. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the film. The actors were well-suited to their roles and the costuming and sets were absolutely delicious (and true to period). The movie did feel a little ""rushed"" to me; the screenplay relied so heavily on dialogue to provide the exposition that, if you missed a line, you could miss 4 months in the lives of the characters. Since I am familiar with the book, this was less of an issue for me but it's the reason I gave the film 4 stars instead of 5.Well worth the $9.99 I paid to rent this, especially since Amazon gives me 48 hours to watch (as opposed to the 24 hours on iTunes) and without the 2-hour ""download"" required elsewhere. I plan to watch again tonight! :-)"
2,"Okay, but not good.","I picked this movie mostly to watch Robert Pattinson, but unfortunately, I found his character to be ""ugly"" inside and out. I usually enjoy watching his movies, but he made a lot of awkward faces and he became distracting to the movie. The plot lines were nothing grabbing or captivating, so it took almost 2 days for me to finish watching it."
3,Well acted period movie,"At first glance Bel Ami is a romp through 1890's Paris presenting accomplished men and women and their flirtations and seductions. It is that to be certain but beneath the obvious lie complicated human emotions and behavior driving the characters to their ultimate end. The women of the circle who pass Robert Patterson's character from one to another suffer emotional deficiencies that only he can soothe. He himself is driven to use them with little remorse to achieve HIS ultimate goal. The settings are pleasurable, lovely drawing rooms, costumes and some tasteful flesh on flesh scenes. Watching the movie was time well spent."
3,Bel Ami,I enjoyed this movie. Robert Pattinson was great in this film. The other actors were also quite good. Would watch this movie again.
4,Brilliant Cast,This movie is so much better than the critics say. It is a period piece and therefore a hard sell to most. The cast is brilliant and the costumes are amazing.Totally worth the price.
4,"Sultry, Sexy and Mysterious",I read Bel Ami long before the movie came out and they could not have better casting. The actors / actresses were fantastic. I thought the movie was great.
2,I had hopes for this movie...,"...it was sadly disappointing. You keep hoping that the character played by Robert Pattinson would grow a bit. Or at least that Pattinson would actually show some acting other than his normal wooden style. The period costume is very nice and helps you keep interest in the movie until the futile end. The female actors did a wonderful job in their roles. The movie itself had great potential to be well done, however, the fact that Pattinson's acting was so poor removes any chance of this movie being labeled as ""good""."
5,Excellent,Great storyline George is such a scoundrel but you love him anyway. The women are great choices. And of course you get to see rob looking all sexy.
2,"Nice production design and costumes, but movie is static","This film had beautiful visuals. There are so many plot holes where the characters talk about something that the audience has no clue about. It's alright, but don't expect to be blown away by any means."
3,the great acting made up for the poor filming & editing,"I am a fan of quite a few of the actors in this piece, so after hearing about the project development and filming I was excited to finally be able to see the finished product.This was a case where the actors did a phenominal job in delivering believable characters that fit the story line. But unfortunately the final product was lacking due to the film techniques or lack there of and it seemed the cutting room floor should have had a few more pieces lying on it as parts of the film just seemed to drag.I am glad I waited for this on DVD. I will keep it because again I am a fan of Uma Thurman, Mr. Pattinson and Ms. Ricci as well.But when I hold Bel Ami side by side with my Sense & Sensibility, Becoming Jane, Pride & Prejudice... basically my historical film collection, it's sadly in last place.Bel Ami"
3,Should have been better,"In Paris, 1890, a penniless young man (Robert Pattinson) is befriended by three married women and quickly becomes the stud muffin du jour. He acquires money and power but learns being a boy toy can be complicated.Based on a story by Guy de Maupassant, this rags-to-riches tale has lavish sets and costumes and beautiful photography. The three female leads (Kristin Scott Thomas, Christina Ricci, Uma Thurmon) are outstanding. The same cannot be said for Pattinson, however; his character is neither handsome nor appealing and so the story falls flat. Also, his dialogue, which deals with emotionally-charged subjects like love and hate and loyalty and betrayal, is stoically-delivered with an unflinching poker-face. He doesn't have the charisma required to make his role believable.If you are a fan of Robert Pattinson, you'll enjoy the movie, but to me, he's still in teen vampire mode. My take: 3 stars."
5,Bel Ami,"He is a scoundrel, a rake, an opportunist. And all the women fall for his charms both in and out of the bedroom. Georges Duroy has no redeeming traits at all but it doesn't matter in the least. As played by Robert Pattinson, his smile lights up the room and his sex appeal simmers and flows right off the screen. Engaging, entertaining and well worth your time."
5,Bel Ami,"As a Robert Pattensin fan, I have purchased another of his films. I also am an avid period piece addict. Great people are in this film."
2,Interesting,"The best acting came from Christina Ricci, who gave another good performance. Rob Pattinson could have been doing Twilight, he wasn't into his character. The plot was the same old same old poor dude wants to be rich dude sleeps his way into big money - end of story."
4,enjoyable,"The movie was a little slow paced, but once the story line built my intrest was kept. The acting was very good, except the acting is a constant reminder of twlight. over all I would recommend this moive to people who enjoy theatrical era time lines."
2,Horrible actor,"Uma Thurman and Christina Ricci make this movie. Very good performances by those two, especially Thurman, but this lead ""actor"" is horrendous! What a waste of ten bucks. This guy can't act to save his life. The story line is boring. It's tolerable if you enjoy period films, and again, Thurman makes it, but seriously - otherwise, a total waste of time."
2,a boring movie,I watched this movie cause I liked Rob. I just didnt like this movie or the plot. It was boring in places.
2,So-So,There was nothing special about this movie. Mostly it was just dark and boring. The cast was a great group and I would've expected more from them.
5,Very good movie,Great movie for those who like period pieces. Amazing cast of talented actors. Nice to see that Robert Pattinson can do more than look like a constipated vampire.
4,Worth the money spent,"It has been a week since I am using this watch and I found it worth the money I spent.There are some hassles maintaining it if you need to use this as a watch. As a PDA I am satisfied with the functionality it gives with the price.Entering data with the little stylus is not very easy and user friendly but if you can do a sync with your computer eases the task.It easily gets synchronized with your computer outlook and you can have all your appointments, address and telephone numbers handy and without much of difficulty.I will give it 4 out of 5."
1,Not worth even $10,I bought this watch for $30 from Amazon. It was trouble all along with this watch.Never compare this with a real PDA. I never took the pain of entering data into this watch. The provided program CD is also not very good.After 2 weeks the Time got stuck. I have never seen a digital watch freezing. It was like Windows hanging on you.Returned it to Amazon and thankfully got a full refund from Amazon...
3,"useful, but huge","A palm on your hand? Yes.A slim fashion complimenting watch? No.This thing is huge and can be very useful if you don't like carrying the bulk of a palm and usually use it for calendar, contacts, and tasks. If that's your goal, but it.If you're a palm power user, taking notes, using graffiti, or more interactive behaviors, then you have a trade-off either get the watch or accept the bulk of a more functional Zire or Tungsten."
2,Functional but flimsy,"The product works just like it says, however after putting into the phone once, when i removed it one of the 2 little plastic clips broke and it will no longer sit in the phone unless i tape it. Does it work? Absolutley, just be careful with it i guess. I did NOT pull hard when removing it either, i didnt even notice anything was wrong until i couldnt get my usb data cable plugged in (due to the clip still being stuck in the phone, which was fun to get out)"
3,It works but it hardly fits,"You have to force the plug to fit into the cell port, it's really frustrating.First I thought that I made a bad acquisition but, I checked the package and the tag said ""For Nokia 6681 6682"" and I have a 6682...So, it works but it hardly fits. You have to find a way to plug it, ...and be patient.Sound quality, very good. As you may know, this also depends the bit rate of the file(s), headphones, or speakers, or any other equipment that may be as an intermediate, before the last two."
2,broke after one day,it did what it was supposed to but only lasted one day. it just broke apart and stopped working. It is too fragile.
1,horrible,this product is horrible. poor quality and it doesnt even fit my nokia n73. just a waste of money
1,Don't Buy LG Dishwashers,LG's LDS5811WW. . . Worst dishwasher ever. The drying mechanism doesn't work very well and it broke after 18 months of use. The motor burned out! At $700 I thought this unit was high end... turned out to be high junk.
1,Belongs in the garbage truck,"We got one of these about 3 years ago. It never cleaned dishes very well, leaving residue no matter what wash type. Then it started generating strange error codes, which I fixed by repairing some cracked wires in the door. Now it just won't power on. Please, don't buy one of these."
1,Don't buy it!,"I was actually quite happy with mine at first. It worked perfectly - good cleaning/drying, very quiet. Now it's dead. I checked on the Internet and see a bunch more people with the same problem - all within the past few weeks. Sounds like a design defect to me.Of course, it's over a year old and out of warranty now so I'll be buying a new dishwasher this weekend. It won't be an LG, though."
5,music that wrenches your soul,"Absolutely, hands down THE french singer. His stories come from such a personal place, and manages to reach in to the deepest folds of our hearts. Of course the melodies (as on every recording) take you far away - yet bring you close to his stories. Sample ""Je n'est rien oublier"". It's beautiful. The whole CD is worth playing over and over. Each song takes you on a different little journey that you can't wait to visit again. Highly recommend it."
4,It is what it states.,I NEEDED TO RETROFIT THIS ITEM TO WORK AS A REPLACEMENT FOR A NUTONE BATH FAN THAT MOVES 100CFM. WAS ABLE TO OVERCOME THE SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN SHAFT SIZE WITH A WIRE TY. SEEMS TO WORK GOOD AND IS ACTUALLY QUIETER THAN THE ORIGINAL ONE. ONLY TIME WILL TELL.
4,"Good, but not perfect","This CD is good. It has got what not alot has. It has movement, power, and it definitely pushes you to sing with it. It is a very good cd, I suggest you buy it. It is truely good, but definitely not as good as Significant Other."
5,You MUST buy this cd!!!,This is the BEST cd i have ever bought. i got it in july 98 and i still listen to it. i also got significant other and this is much better. every song is good.
4,Great CD for Rock/Rap fans,This CD is one of my favorites. It creates a wonderful blend of rock and rap. This is one that everyone should get.
3,Limp Bizket is okay but not like Marilyn Manson,"I really didn't care for the C.D. but the song ""Faith"" was cool and Mnon rulez!!"
3,"Amateurish, but good.","Not nearly as good as KoRn, but aggressive enough for me. They need a little polishing. I bet the next album will be better. I have high hopes for them."
5,Terrific,"I am a parent of 3 children. I have a 2 year old, a 9 year old, and an 11 year old. I let the 11 year old listen to whatever he wants, petty much. I let him do this because if I do not have to listen to it no use letting him not have his own fun. Limp Biskit has a few swear wods, his Korn Cd's have a lot more."
1,ROCK IS DEAD AND RAP IS DA ***!!!,"Yo man, peep dis wack *** album right here, u know what I'm sayin? Ever since rock got killed by rap, u got dz punk *** rock groups tryin 2 sound like rap just so they could sell a record! Limp Bizkit ain't nothin and Fred Durst, yo, u need 2 go and sing some country music or somethin. If yall wanna hear real music, u gots 2 go peep out 2pac (R.I.P), Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, DMX, Ja Rule, Warren G, and da list goes on and on. Can I get a amen? I'm out yall, peace!"
1,Heavy Metal is not cool.,"First of all, when i listen to a cd, i don't expect to hear static, but as long as limp ""bizkit"" is around and they're dirty singer is still ""singing"" it will keep happening. Now for all you heavy metal freaks out there, i suggest you don't play this music too loud or your trailer will tip over. That is, if you can afford a trailer. White trash, I mean Limp Bizcuit suck beyond belief, i'm not saying anything about their fans but i guess you are what you listen too. I'm just surprised these skinny dirtbags can lift the drumsticks high enough to make all that noise."
5,Before turning ALL rap,"Limp Bizkit was a good band. This and Significant Other were both good CDs. Why? Because, unlike Choctlate Starfish And the Hotdog Flavored Water and New Old Songs, those 2 CDs actully make Limp Bizkit a rock band. Their debut album, what i'm reviewing, is a very good ROCK/rap CD. The songs I like are ""Pollution"", ""Counterfeit"", ""Stuck"", ""Faith"", ""Indigo Flow"", and ""Leech"". If you can count, that's 6 songs people, 6. Do you know how many songs I like on CSATHDFW? I like 1 song on CSATHDFW. But enough about that. This album has catchy lyrics, hard guitars, and overall good music. Songs like ""Pollution"", ""Faith"", ""Counterfeit"", and ""Leech"" make you just wanna bang your head, while songs like ""Stuck"" and ""Indigo Flow"" make it impossible not to listen because of the catchy rap lyrics. Anyway, let's hope Fred and the boys go back to the sound of this and Significant other and make SOME rock songs.Peace.-Watty69"
2,LIMP BIZKITS WORST CD,"I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT THIS IS LIMPS BEST CD.""CHOCOLATE STARFISH AND THE HOT DOG FLAVORED WATER""AND""SIGNIFICANT OTHER""WERE GOOD CD's,BUT THIS WAS A MAJOR EMBARASSMENT FOR LIMP BIZKIT.THERE WERE ONLY TWO REASONS THAT I DIDN'T GIVE THIS CD ONE STAR.1:""FAITH"" IS A GOOD SONG OFF OF THIS CD.AND 2:I'M A BIG LIMP BIZKIT FAN.THIS IS A HORRIBLE CD,AND THATS COMING FROM ONE OF LIMP BIZKITS BIGGEST FANS."
1,"Ohhh god, please make it stop!","Ah, let me see. This album ranks up there with root canals and drowning in human excretion. If I hear Fred frickin Durst's name on the radio one more time I'm going to start a cult and insight a mass suicide. Limp Bizkit, the quintessential ""total request live"" rock band, gained much of it's popularity through this album. Mainly from the inane single ""Nookie"". And if ""Nookie"" and Limp Bizkit are the future of rock I fear for the nations youth. In other words ""you can take this album and stick up your a**, stick it up your a**, stick it up your...."""
1,boooooooooo boooooo booooooo .,dr don agian. this is by far the most pice of s..t that i ever heard people why wast the mony on this garbage lets get real this band should of been award for the wurst telleted bands ever. Drew Simollardes wonld give fred durts a run for his muney if your for any band thats nu metal rap metal then get revellie after you hear thim yull whant to chouk all your limp bizket cds or burn thim. give it up and get this you guys suck.and save your selfs from this Inbarisment.keep it in mind stay away from this cd and Significant Other andChocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water there bad new thiy should there cds in stick thim up ther a..s. take my envise dont lisnd to this band thiy suck.boooooooooooooooooooooo.
1,"1st album sucked, the other 3 are soo much better.",And quessition to the dude below:Why'd u have to bleep out a letter in Starfish? It's not a bad word at all!
2,if you like limp bizkit please DO NOT GET SIGNIFICANT OTHER,"What ever you do get this album from limp bizkit the thing is dont get significant other because its just more rap for instance the song n2gethernow has method man sing the whole song fred barely even sings in it .The only songs that are good is nookie,brake stuff,just like this. on the other hand 3 dollar bill yall is alot better .even though limp bizkit has gotten trendy 3 dollar bill yall is alot harder"
2,1 dollar bill Yall$,"Well, i don't particuly care for Fred Durst and his band of illiterate friends. After buying this, i thought well this is nice (after hearing Counterfeit) but then the tunes just got toooo repetitive. Ross Robinson, being the great producer that he is didn't do the second one, i would give SO 1 star, cuz this is a bit better. I mean, Fred singing Faith, it had to happen."
3,Significant Other is way better,I bought this CD a couple of months ago and listen to it off and on. There are only a couple good songs and the rest are really bad. If you are thinking about getting this CD you should look into their new one Significant Other which is an awesome CD.
1,No.,"What do you call a fat, middle-aged, washed up, untalented hack with a microscopic weenie??? (if you saw that stupid new sex tape, which was pretty gross, you'll know what I mean)...Give up? You call her Fred Durst..Yes I'm aware that i said ""her"". Seriously though....wait...I was being serious...anyway..I'd rather listen to a cat getting electrocuted than this album. If this is considered their best albums, I don't even want to know what their worst is. It's not only Fred though, the whole band sucks. The guitarist sucks, almost every band with a DJ is stupid, and I'm sure the other two suck as well...in conclusion, they all suck, especially Phat Fred...sorry..Fat Fred..OK that was lame..but anyway..yeah this band sucks and avoid this album or any other album by this extremely crappy band."
1,"phony as a three dollar bill, y'all","The 'Poser-Band-with-the-least-musical-talent-to-sell-the most-records-to-musically-ignorant-Mtv-teenagers-award' goes to... *drum roll* *fart!* Limp Bizkit!Now, I know that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but c'mon. Let me tell you, I listen to just about every genre of music out there, and recognizing the level of talent behind any music is easy; I may not like a song or a band, but can tell if the artist has any talent. I don't think Fred Durst can even call himself an artist. The only thing these guys are good at is putting forth an image."
4,limp bizkit's only good album !,"I hate limp bizkit with a passion and i actullie was into them but ever since they starting to go downhill cd after cd i was like? screw this !I gave 4 starts because i hate the gay pop song ""faith"" that song blows!!!The rest of the album is fine tho! My fav songs ? mm ""stuck"" , ""polution"" , ""counterfeet"" , ""stink finger"" , "" clunk"" , and ""indigo flow"" all are very very great tracks that i used to cherish and some times still do but i can't stand limp bizkit now! Limp bizkit sucks!!!PS: the song ""counterfeet"" was great because i actullie thought that Fred was not a counterfeet and that he was honest and would never sell himself out but boy was i wrong ? Fred, your the counterfeet dude... Freddurst is a disgrace!!!!! Laters!!!"
5,BEST BIZKIT,"This has got to be their best cd. fred durst screams his head off on this cd. wes's guitar is different than their other cds. sam has the best bass in all their cds. jhon has a different drum set.And dj lethal is back up. the best songs are poulltion, stuck,stink finger and has hits counterfiet faith and sour. this is one of my fav's cds. if like limp bizkit then you need this."
4,good...for 5 minutes,"i just bought this cd 'cause i wanted the song "" pollution"", which appears in a dragon ball z movie , i really liked that song it fitted the movie just right,anyway that's the only song worth listening to , the other ones are not so good , it's mostly like rap , man this guys ruined the name of ""rock"", oh well..."
1,Bad and sad,"My son made me listen to this. While I'm glad he was willing to share his interests, I have to say this is really awful. Really. Kids these days a so unfortunate. They don't get any good music or culture and they use this junk to fill the void. I don't even think my son likes it, I think he just wants to be popular. Isn't that sad? If only kids had music like Buffalo Springfield, which expressed angst and outrage in a sophisticated manner, instead of this destructive, ugly, hateful waste."
1,This CD makes a good coaster for my coffee...,"What garbage, Bobby Brady made better noise on his drum set"
1,Limp Bizkit is the worst band in the history of music,They rank right down there with Isane Clown Posse and all of those other no talent wanna be musicians. It makes me sick to think that people actually listen to this noise. This album isn't even worthy of the 1 star rating. My advice to anyone considering buying this album is to get your head checked. and that's my 2 cents.
1,it cudda been zen!,ok i have to admit i do LUV limp bizkit but i thought this cd was jus sumethin they threw 2gether in a matter of a week and was tottally over retted! if u want a REALLY good limp bizkit cd get significant other! i luv that song NOOKIE!
1,"You don't have ""0 star"" as an option?","Check out ""Mega!! Kung Fu Radio"" by POWERMAN 5000. They're way better than Limp Bizkit in this genre. Limp Bizkit are still too wet behind the ears."
1,"You don't have ""0 star"" as an option?","Check out ""Mega!! Kung Fu Radio"" by POWERMAN 5000. They're way better than Limp Bizkit in this genre."
3,NO! NO! NO! NO!,"With the blaring of guitars and the blurting out of strange lyrics Limp Bizkit has toaly messed of the way I look at music. Is it Metal? Rap? Both? I must admit that ""Sour"" is a good song but when I listend to the rest I wasn't imprested. Yo Yo I raped. I didn't mean to do that, Anyway I'm not a really big fan of this new ""Hip hop meets Metal"" fab thats why a gave it three stars. I gave it three for the way they use Metal and I took two away for the way they used hip hop(rap, whatever) I was nice when I reviewd this."
2,Some songs had promise,"I don't know why KORN backed this album, it sounds nothing like their music. With Korn, I can actually make out the lyrics, and the lyrics make some sense. Limp Bizkit has a LONG way to go in that regard. It's just alot of yelling, which, sorry to say folks, isn't music. There's alot more to music than that, but the teeny-boppers seem to like it for the adrenaline rush it gives them. Good for them. Bad for the rest of us who appreciate good music."
4,The best bizkit album,"I've been a fan of Durst an Co. ever since this album was first released,and it is by far the best bizkit album.Heavy (...)and catchy as hell!The other two releases they have done in my opinion (stink)! as they seemed to have mellowed out a bit.From the opening track ""Pollution"" you know these guys are gonna rock like a whippet on speed.It only gets better from here on in folks,the classic ""Counterfeit"" starts with a whisper and ends with you having to change your underwear.Following on is another (great)tune,""Suck"" which is catchier than scabies.This album is more likely to appeal to fans of Slipknot or Will Haven,cos' its got that rougher edge to it."
4,Its almost as good as KoRn,"I think that Limp Bizkit should have a cameo by Jon Davis. Then, they would have a rockin' disc. If you purchase this disc, listen to #'s 3,4,5,&9."
4,over all pretty good,"this cd is great except for the fact that they just bacically copied korn. despite the fact, their rap/ metal mix is overall awesome"
5,This alubum kicks it is the best,This is the best alubum of the year. I think anyone that gave it one or two stars is death or just plain STUPID
2,"Limp bizkit is my favorite band,but this album is complete garbage","i own most of their studio albums,and if you want a real limp bizkit experience,buy significant other,if you want something funny,get chocolate starfish and hot dog flavored water,if you want a dark album,get results may vary,and gold cobra is simply amazing,but i cant listen to this album for more than 5 minutes without turning it off,its worth getting for faith and counterfeit but that's it,its horrible,they made it in 9 days guys,no effort at all"
5,Rap/metal at its best,"Before Limp Bizkit became generic rap/metal sellouts they released this album, there debut. This will always remain one of the only credible albums in the genre and even know i've heard it many times it is still a worthy part of my CD collection. The production is not up to the same standard as later releases but Fred's songwriting is more intelligent and meaningful and his singing has greater range and is far less annoying. The guitars have a heavy but raw, jagged sound, the bass is quite good, drummer John Otto shines throughout the album, particularly with the jazzy percussion on album highlight Stuck and DJ Lethal, though i feel he is under used by LB, produces some fine scratches.The best tracks are Stuck, Pollution, Counterfeit, Stalemate and Clunk (with its wicked bassline)but Leech (demo),sour, Nobody Loves me and the hit single Faith are all worth a listen. Get this album as well as both of (Hed)pe's CD's and Snot."
1,Gutless rap metal!,"A disappointment as far as i'm concerned, who's idea was it to combine rap and metal anyway? Not that all of it is bad,but the combination here doesn't do anything for me. They cover George Michael's Faith, I like what they've done with that song, other than that a dull album, what for a complation."
1,No.,"This CD has always stunk. I bought this CD way before they hit big, and even hated it then. All my friends were like ""How can you hate it"" and now I'm the one saying ""How can you like it."" Everyone's embarassed. At the end of Pollution, Fred yells over and over again ""FRED, SHUT THE F--- UP!"" I couldn't put it any better. Don't be fooled. This is not LB's only good CD -- they don't have a good CD."
1,Terrible!,"I truely cannot beleive that this band is as popular as they are. I can't make sense of it. Their song ""faith"" gives me a headache, it don't understand how they got permission from George Michael to ruin his song."
4,MELLOW OUT!,faith is blissful noise. counterfeit shows durst know what going on around him. stalemate and clunk show the band knows how to make great music. a little to heavy at times but hey who cares.
1,I Miss Music,"Remember when music required things like harmony, melody, and rhythm? This cd lacks all of that. It has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Avoid this junk at all costs.As the Beatles would say, ""Let it be."""
4,Does anyone have this album?,"I love Limp Bizkit's other two albums, but this one is probably the most meaningful. The new stuff is mostly sell-out ""look how cool we are"" songs. They need to make more music like this. It's loud AND deep! What more could you ask for? Maybe they could have added more songs and made some shorter. The last track, the nearly instrumental Everything, is an insane 16:20 long....if you take that away, the album's only about 45 minutes, not really that long at all."
4,I HATE LIMP BIzKIT!!....,"...But I really like this album. I'm not a fan of their's at all. In fact I decided to write a review of this album after listening to their latest one (Results May Vary) which I thought was complete garbage. ""3 Dollar Bill"" I think highlights Limp Bizket in all thier glory. It's raw, it's aggressive and it's funky! The band does a great job of changing it up throught the songs. Wes surley had the musical muscle and creativity in the band as you can see by how bad the new album is. If you like this CD, pick up Biohazard's ""Urban Dicipline"" which I would say is THE birth of rap/hip hop/ metal/hardcore. Even predateing Rage Against the Machine! Good stuff..."
2,Weack,They bucther George Michaels Faith and the album is stupid like Silent Bob's Cousin Olaf( Watch Clerks) with songs that sound metal but are just stupid. Korn is better System of a Down is good but Chopsuey is to stupid in the end this album is barley worth 3 dollors.
3,LIMP BIZKIT'S BEST!!!!,"This is by far the best album by Limp Bizkit....Fred Durst got less rap lyrics and uses more gutural screams, which i think is way better than the white rapper style he incorporates in the future records...There's some songs that i REALLY don't care, but also the greatest ones by LB like COUNTERFEIT, POLLUTION, NOBODY LOVES ME and STUCK!!!"
3,limp bizkit kicks &@*,the CD is awesome i love it and i have been listening to them for 2 years and no one knew who they were.and now they are popular and they are getting the fame they deserve
5,It is very good,I think this cd is very good.It has so much diverse music.They are much more diverse than Korn or Rammstien. They are the only band in that genre that have a dj. I think that Korn saying that they sound close to rap is untrue because this is close to rap. I think that Fred's vocals are awesome. Of course my oppinion is biased because I know him. I live in their home town and have seen a lot of shows. They are a very good band and anyone should buy their cd.
3,It was pretty good,"I actually liked this CD I don't really care what other people say of it, actually, they can go to hell. And to the person that said it takes garbage to know garbage- aren't you calling them garbage? Maybe YOU are garbage you big idiot, you dug yourself a hole:)"
3,"Bizkit has potential, but is still undercooked","When I first bought this cd, I was expecting lead singer Fred Durst to be the same hip-hop pimp as he was on the ""All in the Family"" with KoRn, busting out the phat rhymes over heavy guitar riffs from the other band members. Instead, this album is more of endless shouting and screaming, which really isn't all that bad, but if I want to hear Jon Davis, I'll listen to KoRn. This band is incredibly talented, but if they want to get off the ground, they should stray away from trying to become the Deftones and KoRn and venturing into their hip-hop roots, and it looks like that's the direction they're headed hearing their new single ""Nookie"".Recommended songs: Counterfeit, Stuck, and Faith is always a good singalong."
2,not very good,"tracks 3, 4, and 9 are good, but the rest isn't. If you want someone that can really rap/rock get rage against the machine's evil empire."
5,Caleb - USA,This CD is really great and I recommend it to everybody who likes some rap and heavy metal
2,What happend to heavy metal??,"The main thing I have against this cd is the guitar and bass sounds like it has a cold. I dont know how they have them tuned or what petals they use but the sound is just plan annoying (especially on counterfeit) If you want to hear real heavy metal try METALLICA, MEGADETH, OZZY, or IRON MAIDEN."
4,DECENT,"this cd has some pretty good songs like pollution, counterfiet, stuck, and faith. i liked korns debut album better than limp bizkits. korn is way better than limp bizkit but that doesn't mean bizkits that bad. also bizkit isn't no where close to sounding like metallica. the fan who said they did was stupid."
1,LAME!!!!!!!,Is not Three Dollar bill is NO dollar bill I bet those guys are not rich!!!!!! and They STINK!!!
1,no zero star review darn,"See my review on Korn again white guy's acting black and that faith song, it's a cold day in hell but I like a george michael song more by him than someone else that says that bizkit suck and really are three dollar billz yall, look if your a white suburban kid be happy ya are and act white ok??? believe me it's the way ok....."
1,garbage is as garbage does,this album is very lame. it makes me feel ill and you should not buy it. try the new mariah carey or matchbox 20 instead. they're REAL musicians.
1,Are CDs dishwasher safe?,"Limp Bizkit's new album is just garbage from the beginning grunts to the final grunts. Even the jerks from Korn hate this album, and they should know, because it takes garbage to know garbage."
1,This one's worth 3 dollars y'all!,"If you can get past the lack of originality, the grunting, the lack of harmony and melody, and incessant mumbling, you'll love this album."
1,Backstreet Boyz on Nicotine,"Limp Bizkit is the worst band making music today. Their music is tired, played-out, and without originality. They'll be working at the carwash faster than you can say ""Ten Inches of Snow""."
1,this is disgusting,"limp bizkit is a disgusting band with a disgusting name, forget them they are trash punks copying the originality of korn-if you want real music listen to korn or rob zombie,but don't waste good money on euro trash punks like limp bizkit.KoRn rulezzzz."
1,Is this what passes off for music nowadays?,"This album is so terrible and so pathetic. All the 'songs' suck, especially their pointless cover of George Michael's Faith. Go spend your money on something more important, like food (you need to eat something, don't you?)"
1,This sucks,it's not good at all. every single song besides counterfeit is so terrible. you'll hate it!
1,Gravy and Biscuits,"Corn is probably the worst band making records today. However, these guys, LIMP Bizkit, give them a real run for their money. The album is full of grunting, which is nice if your an ape in heat, but not so great if you're expecting melodies and harmonies. But what is most noteworthy about this ridiculous bunch of garbage is their unapologetic butchering of George Michael's ""faith"". And so in summary, if you're a corn fan, you'll love these morons."
2,RATM will never be topped.,"The style known as rapcore, or rap metal is being highly degraded by this album. Where is the intellect? When I listen to rapcore I want something highly political. With this album you get a bunch of false anger that is only fueled by the tempo. I can't even listen to this album for more than the first couple of songs. It just sits and collects dust in my room. I don't really care for this album, but I'm sure all the little junior high kids will."
4,Why was it kept so buried?,"Limp Bizkit's defining album was Three Dollar Bill, Ya'll$, but it didn't receive the publicity or the hype it deserved. Containing excellent songs that never manage to grow old, $3 Bill was very underrated. Significant Other can't lay a finger on this album, but yet it received major hype. That's not saying that it was a bad album, but as I said, it can't lay a finger on $3 Bill.With highly addictive and well written songs like Faith, Stuck, Stink Finger, Nobody Loves Me, Pollution, and Counterfeit, $3 Bill is jam packed with great tracks that keep you coming back over and over again. To this day I still listen to this album. It's just very dissapointing that it didn't receive the hype Significant Other did. Oh well. I just hope that Limp Bizkit's next album tries hard to get back to the sound on this album, because these were their best days."
1,limp is as limp does,Limp Bizzzkit is a very unoriginal band. They can't rap. They can't sing. They can't play their instruments. They can't even make a George Michael song better. What a bunch of losers.
4,very good,Limp Bizkit did a good job on the new cd but korn's cd's are a whole lot better!!!! Still it is a cd worth buying.
5,We're all different,"I LOVED THIS CD!!!! yes, everyone says limp is copyin korn, but can u really say that? they both were their on seperate bands, but they found a common bonds and became good friends! Korn and Limp Bizkit are two totally different bands that share a similar style, but not the style of each other! I just wanna make it perfectly clear to all the people out there seaching for reasons to put them down, THEY ARE NOT COPYING ANYTHING FROM ANY ONE!!!! I loved the CD and I loved all the Korn albums, and I really recommand you buy this CD, its not a waste of money!!!"
5,this is the best group along with korn,this was the best cd i ever heard abd any one who likes this kind of music should by this cd
4,great,"if your a limp bizkit fan buy this cd, if your not, then get the - out. no just kidding. this cd is cool but i dont see why everyone likes ""faith"". i dont like it except for the fact that it is laughable because fred is screaming ""gotta have faith"" like a metal band and he's deranged or something. anyway i suggest you buy this cd if your a rap/rock fan and definately if your a limp bizkit fan but i reccomend significant other more."
5,this is bizkits good ones,although bizkits second one is better i like the songs on this one to you should by this cd before you by significant other so you can see what they are about and get it from amazon.com
3,AN OK CD,"this cd isnt as good as significant other,but it has some good songs. i still recommend it,and its well worth getting."
1,Actually they deserve O star...,"Don't compare them with Korn, although you might have heard that they're friends. Korn are way better than them. Limp Bizkit aren't original at all. They're truly limp, very limp."
1,Korn Biscuit,"It never ceases to amaze me what the youth of today will let pass through their ears. First, we had to deal with disco, then rap, then grunge, and now this garbage. Will ever stop yo? I don't know. Turn off the lights and I'll glow. To the extreme I rock the mic like a handle, light up a stage a wax a chump like a candle. Anyway, this album is hogwash."
1,The Worst CD Ever,"This is the absolute worst CD I have ever heard. Every song sounds the same. If you are considering buying it, take a look at all the one star reviews it got and spend your money elsewhere."
1,I wish we could give negative stars,"What a worthless band, what a worthless album. How could they release this mess? How could someone record it, listen to it, and say, ""hey that came out well! Im proud of this generic piece of drivel!"" And if anyone calls this... metal ever again, I will go on a mindless rampage. This is not heavy metal. It is a rap album - if you like rap, then fine, but dont call it metal, call it rap. If I make a country album and call it techno, im not reinventing techno, im just a schmuck."
5,this album is awsome,"this is the best album ever. what can i say limp bizkit can doit all at once rap metal its all there i recomend this to anyone who likes korn or the deftones,or just any band of that nature. this album rocks"
3,bon jour! ca va?,"Salut! Je suis francaise. Moi et mon copines sont tres sympa et petite mais oune a' mon amie est disagreable. Nous sommes eleves dans le meme lycee. Maintenent, il est sept heure vingt cinq.Mon amies, Ils sont dans chaises. Je suis de Seattle. Il est tres chouette. Il est vraiment sympa. De jour il vrandradi. Vous etes ocupee? je suis libre maintenant. Je suis tres amusante, d'accord? Je nes suis pas brune, mais Je suis faux blonde. have a nice day!"
1,crap music,wow this is the worst album ever and i mean ever!!!nu-metal sucks - thank god for thier flop album Results May Varyso than limp bizkit can die and retire
5,Great music and decent lyrics,"I spent most of last week listening to 3 Dollar Bill Ya'll. It ended up being one of the best rap CD's I hve ever heard. While in general I hate rap I found this CD keeps your attention with some great bass and guitar solos, something missing from most gangsta rap. Hopefully this isn't Limp Bizkit's last work. Also went to go to see them in concert and was not dissappointed. They sound true to their CD"
1,Disappointing,"After buying Significant Other and loving it, I was eager for more, so I bought this. This album is a lot different than their other two albums. To a guy who is into rock for the most part, this album is basically a lot of distortion and yelling. The only song on this album that I like is ""Faith"", I'm embarrassed to say. I'm not a wussy Guster fan; I liked every single track on Significant Other. The music on this album is simply different than the newer stuff."
4,ITS PRETTY GOOD,"If you dont like the sound of rap and hard rock mixing,then you wont like this,but if you do this is a really good rapcore/rap-metal(or whatever you prefer to call it)album.The first songs are the best,especially pollution,but all the songs are not great,stinkfinger for instance is just ok,and the last song everything is kinda boring.Overall this is a good album."
4,NOT LIMP BIZKIT'S BEST.,"I LUV LIMP BIZKIT. THERE A REALLY TALENTED BAND, BUT SINGNIFICAT OTHER WAS A BETTER CD. BUT THIS CD IS STILL PHAT! I LOVE IT, AND I WOULD NEVER GIVE IT UP. IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OF LIMP'S CDS, GET THEM NOW!!!!!!!!!! THERE REALLY GOOD! LIMP BIZKIT IS VERY TALENTED! AND IF YOU THINK THERE JUST ANOTHER N SYNC AND BACK DOOR BOYS, WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM????????"
2,OK But Could Have Been Better,All I have to say is that this cd could have been better. I have been a fan of these guys since I heard Nookie at a friend's house and I decided to purchase both cds. I did and liked Significant Other better. Fred Durst has a cool voice. The lyrics are awesome on this album but the music could have been better. This one was also heavier. Rap meets heavy metal. I would buy Significant Other first and if you REALLY like it buy this one too.
3,Limp Bizkit's only decent album,"I will never call this album good, but it is decent.this is limp bizkit's only good albumFINAL THOUGHT - give it a shot, buy it if you want."
5,This CD RULES!,"The combination of rock and rap has always worked and it works here too.Like Rage Against The Machine,Korn,many others.I heard Follow The Leader and I must say it is impressive but compared to these guys who,by the way,are talented musicians,it is a pile of dust"
3,Buy This Album...Forget the Rest,Get this album and try your best to ignore the later Limp Bizkit offerings. Enjoy Fred Durst before he became an ego maniac and drove off Wes Borland. Listen to some pretty good music before he became obsessed with riding plywood around Woodstock and trashing Trent Reznor. Grrrr...writing this just makes me remember how much I liked Limp Bizkit early on.
3,Pretty good...what happened?,"Well, i really think that Limp Bizkit used to be a good band back when this CD came out. This CD has some great music, but somewhere along the line, they got the idea that they were better than everyone else and started putting out sh#t. I understand that it's very easy to get wrapped up in the indrustry, but these guys got overboard after awhile. I reccomend this one, but don't waste your hard earned cash on any other ""Bizkit"" albums."
1,Health Warning,"Yes Apparently repeated listening causes impotence. Seriously though this is thye apex of Limp Bizkits art, if you can call it that. Difficult to absorb in one sitting yet devoid of any underlying integrity this is an album that will sit umcomfortably in your collection. Until the day your girlfriend drops you for owning it. Take my advice buy Gentle Giants ""Power and the Glory"" and see just how drastically Limp Bizkit have failed in their artistic vision. Anyone showing this band sympathy should consider their reasons and question their self esteem. Avoid at all costs."
3,"THESE GUYS ARE HOMOSEXUAL, Look at the facts","for one, 3 dollar bill is a reference to ""as queer as a 3 dollar bill."" Have you never heard that saying before? Secondly, they cover a George Micheal song? Lastly, look at the album cover."
2,loud... and that's about it,"Limp Biskit's appeal is somewhat confusing. While they seem to be able to write intelligent lyrics, they mostly scream them unintelligibly. They're certainly hard and heavy, but almost totally lacking in melody. Crossing rap with metal was a good idea, but, frankly, this is a poor execution."
5,this is the greatest CD ever,"If you are doubting to buy this CD...DON'T!! This CD is absolutely great! I thought that I wouldn't like it bt was i wrong. I bought the CD because I wanted to hear how good the remix of George Micheal's ""Faith"" would be. It was great. Then I started to listen to other tracks. They were also great. The CD starts out with a great intro...and then goes on to the first real song.....""Pollution""...another great song. Here are all of the tracks: 1.Intro 2.Pollution 3.Counerfeit4.Stuck. 5.Nobody Loves Me 6.Sour 7.Stalemate 8.Clunk 9.Faith 10.Stink Finger 11.Indigo Flow 12.Leech(Demo Version) 13.Everything That's about it. All of the songs are great and the artworks b Fred Durst are amazing. Buy this CD! Cuz you gotta have faith!"
2,Too Trendy....,"This album bites... it has 2 good songs on it and one of them they didn't even write they had to go and copy that George Micheal guy. But Counterfeit of those two songs I guess is a good starter for albums to come. But of the 13 songs on the album they can only produce one song on their own that acctually sounds good... so let's put it this way, if they didn't have Korn supporting them do you think they'd be where they are right now?"
4,This cd kicks @$$,Limp bizkit is cool but for all you people who think that they are better than korn just remember this the concert that is goin on is korn's not limp bizkit's
5,I LOVE this CD,"Although it took me a while to get used to the sound of this album after listening to ""Signficant Other"", once I really started listening to it, I LOVED it. The songs are really good when dealing with greedy, fake people. This is a CD that really gets your energy pumping and your heart racing...overall its much better than Significant Other, although I hope their new album will be a mix between the best of both albums."
3,Mediocre except for stuck and few others,Stuck and Counterfit were cool songs the othrs were just ehh
3,"Nothing special, but a decent listen","The Ross Robinson produced _Three Dollar Bill, Y'all_ is not nearly as bad an album as Limp Bizkit's successive albums might lead one to believe. Although this album may not be overflowing with musical talent, it's not terrible. Some of the songs come off as being useless filler, but songs like ""Stuck,"" ""Pollution,"" and ""Nobody Loves Me"" are enjoyable. However, for some good rock-rap type stuff, you're better off checking out bands like Shootyz Groove and Stuck Mojo."
1,lame biscuits,"Limp...ha,ha,ha... an interesting way to describe this freaky version of the Backstreet Boyz. These Lame Biscuits lack creativity and originality in their less than stellar release. And no song demonstrates their lack of talent better than their wretched cover of George Michael's ""Faith."" Grunting and whining and rolling your eyes can only be original for so long. 98 Degrees and N' Stync are more creative."
1,nauseating,"I can't believe the youth of today has come to this. My 13 year old son is in love with this group, Limp Bizkit. When I hear him play this ""music"", all I hear is loud, irritating noise, which includes many profane words, that I don't want my son listening to. What I don't understand is why he can't listent to wholesome, decent music, like Kenny G or Johnny Mathis (my two favorite artists). So parents, please, do not let your children buy this vulgar and ear piercing music. My son has had a bad influence."
1,Positive Role Models,"I have been a fan of heavy music since my teen years, and still am now in my mid-twenties. Truthfully I don't even own this album, and frankly, I never will. My reasons? I saw Limp in concert with Ozzy, and was getting into their music which I'd never heard before, when I noticed that throughout the set the lead singer consistently degraded women, calling them names and then getting some cognitively delayed female to take off her clothes and dance around on stage. If misogynism is a marketing tactic for y'all, I'm sure you've lost many a sale from intelligent women who don't appreciate being treated like dirty diaper cakes at a concert we paid good money to see. I didn't pay to get called a easy pants pupett. Just because you have the short man complex dude, don't take it out on us. Screw you. You probably are as ___ as a 3 dollar bill."
1,Talentless hacks make me sick.,"After hearing this album, I had the sudden urge to drive to the dentist to have all my teeth yanked---without anesthesia. My thinking was that, since I had suffered so horribly at the hands of this band, a little more pain wouldn't be so bad at all. The ""songs"" all sound the same, which is to say bad, and the lead singer's voice has all the musicality of a rusty chainsaw carving up a blackboard. People with plants or pets shouldn't buy this album, because the former will die and the latter will go mad and bite their owners. Avoid this album like the plague!!!"
1,yuperuny,um im sorry i barrowed this movie thing from a freind and.... it was like dragon ball Z for girls! i mean come on what the frick is this crap. heres how it goes with all of it: they get into a problem then they get out of the problem and they get into a problem then they get out of the problem and they get into a problem then they get out of the problem and they get into a problem then they get out of the problem and. Until you relize youve lost count to the amount of crap they get into. aftet it was over i felt like a monkey with AIDS... its like a bad sitcom... that's not funny or entertaining!
1,Kindle Edition No Good Zero Stars,"I looked at the sample of this on my Kindle1. It is some kind of unedited scan, screwed up formatting riddled with unresolved characters, no Greek. It gave my Kindle1 fits even to display and navigate the Sample (locked up twice). Totally useless, shouldn't even be listed, virtual fraud."
1,Horrible,This is a transliteration of the Greek in a highly confusing layout without a linked alphabetical reference. It is completely unusable.
5,A True Master Work,"My teacher, who studied under Joe Fava at Wayne State, has me studying this method after I went through Aaron Shearer's first (and best) volume. Sagreras was meticulous in his style. He provided an immense level of detail for the student, leaving nothing to chance. The pieces build technique with a very steady, methodic progression. I highly recommend this series for anyone who is a serious student of the classical guitar."
4,Nice collection,"Very nice collection of music. The strength of Sagreras' books is the music, not necessarily the teaching part. I often go back to these books for the music."
1,Hate to be harsh,"I decided to give this book a try knowing it to be a great risk. I tend to filter the books I read based on the reviews on amazon, and though this book had only one slanted review, I decided to give it a try.I read only a few pages completely, and I found it laborious to read. The pages are riddled with gramatical errors and misspelt words. Having been put off, I decided to skip around trying to determine if the information contained warranted reading further. Unfortunately I found it was not. The writing was bland, and the information uninspiring. I found that there was nothing in its pages that made this book worth the money I paid for it.I hate to say it, but I must recommend that you skip this book."
5,RJBTerrace,"I like the story the Apple and the Arrow because it was very interesting in the story and it was very dramatic. William Tell passed by a pole with a hat on it, and when he passed the hat he was supposed to bow down to it. William refused to. So he had to tie his son up to a tree then he had to shoot the apple off of his son's head. If he missed and killed his son they both would have to die. If he hit the apple they both stayed alive. Then he shot the apple with the arrow, and did not kill his son so they both stayed alive. This story is a lively story that really happened."
5,QTBernard Terrace,"What I like about the Apple and the Arrow is that Walter's mom told him stories that she wasn't supposed to tell. William Tell and his son Walter were walking one day and two guards told William Tell to bow down the the king's hat or else. William refused to bow down the king's hat. Then the king passed by and the two guards told him that he refused to bow down. The king made William shoot an apple off of his son's head, or they would both die."
3,TLBTerrace,"I like this book a little. It is about a man trying to shoot an apple of his son's head with an arrow, but if he did not make it he and his son will DIE. Read this story and find out more. I like the story a little because it is kind of scary when he has to shoot the apple and he and his son might die."
5,liberty and tyranny,"This is a long version of the William Tell story, and it makes an excellent adventure for boys. My little guys loved ""William Tell"" by Leonard Everett Fisher, and Mary and Conrad Buff make the story into a novel for boys.Newbery Award winner from 1951 - hunting and fighting and praying and imprisonment and captivity and the brutality of arbitrary government. Revolution against tyranny. Great pencil sketch illustrations; some color illustrations. Lovely book.I'm guessing in 1951, it was Newbery-worthy and edgy to imagine a world of petty tyrants insisting people respect their authori-TAY. Welcome to 2011."
4,So-so,"I fell in love with this ring immediately. The look, quality, and fit is great! The only thing I don't like is after I've worn it for awhile it leaves a mark on my finger. :("
2,Sizing is OFF,"The ring is really cute and it feels sturdy enough. But I ordered a size 8 so that I could wear it on my middle finger, and it barely fits my ring finger, (which means it is on the small side of a size 7). Maybe they just sent me the wrong size, (though the invoice says ""8""), but if this is indeed what they consider an 8, then they have a faulty measuring tape!I'm going to keep it anyway, but I'm kind of disappointed."
3,it is a nice ring,Size seems to run a bit smaller but I am keeping as a gift for my niece. Not as thick as I would have liked but for the price it is a nice buy.
5,Simply beautiful,"Admitingly... you might not get the full story unless you read the book, since the movie is only loosely based off of it. Not everything is explained away. But it has to be one of the most beautiful animes I've ever seen. It has a way of drawing you in and wishing you were there. The emotional depths the characters go through, keep your interest. It's Japanese to English dubbing is purposely well done. You hardly notice."
5,Inspired,"Such a great animation movie for adults and older children. Really enjoyed the story, taken away so easily to another world. Beautiful art."
3,"not miyazaki's best, but...","There are some great visual images in this film that only an imagination (and budget) like Miyazaki can muster. The plot's a bit thin and the movie slows up toward the ending but its great to see traditional animation still being made.If this is your first Miyazaki film, I highly recommend seeing the oft-overlooked more ""adult"" PRINCESS MONONOKE and the brilliant MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO as follow-ups to this."
4,Enchanting,"The movie is so enchanting and fun to watch. I remember reading and loving the book as a child. When I heard Hayao Miyazaki was making an animated version of the book, I couldn't work up the nerve to watch it - what if the animated version ruined my wondorous enjoyment of the book? I need not have worried, though I'm finally watching it in 2012. I'm so glad I did, this film was delightful almost from the beginning. The way the characters are drawn and depicted makes you like them very much. It was a pleasure. The best movies truly fill you with joy and positive excitement as this one did for me!"
5,Howl's Moving Castle,Item was received very quickly and was liked very much as expected. I would recommend this to a friend or family
3,"Good at times, confusing some others.","If this movie were a person, it'd be an elegant young noble-woman falling down a set of stairs and being caught by the one she is in love with.The scene would start being elegant, then it'd be confusing and then it'd be heartwarming. And that's what this movie is... elegant, confusing and heartwarming.Not Miyazaki's best but definitely very, very enjoyable."
5,Great Movie!,Howl's Moving Castle is great! All the family will love this movie. Highly recommended.
4,"""Good Manga Movie""","I love the animation, though i think the movie could be a bit better. Still the story has a good plot."
2,Great Animation of an I-Could-Care-Less Story,"The animation in this film is really great, even if the characters have those gigantic manga eyes that are so cliché. The colors are brilliant, the sets are huge and the movement fluid. But...Who really cares about a young girl working in a hat shop that transforms into an annoying old woman - for most of this 2 hour film??? Does anyone really want to go see a cartoon about an old woman? I guess they do in Japan, where Moving Castle was a huge hit. But it didn't work for me.The vocal casting for Moving Castle was also butchered having Christian Bale voice the leading male character. His rasping Batman voice was totally wrong for an androgynous teenage character.I guess if this was a half hour long, I wouldn't have been so harsh. But this thing just went on and on. 2 hours and change is too long for any movie, particularly one with a dud cast. Every Justice League Unlimited this season was better than this film, and free."
3,HUH?,"Anyone expecting this movie's plotline to be anything remotely like the Dianna Wynn Jones novel, will be totally disappointed. Hayao Miyazaki shows yet again, his gift for animation and originality. However, saying that he took ""creative liberties"" with the story is an understatement. I sat stunned as I watched the Witch of the Waste turn into a sweet, harmless old lady. And Howl morphs into a bird-like monster to fight in a war. Why? They never really explained. Michael, a teenaged apprentice, in love with Sophie's sister, in the movie is Markl, a goofy little side-kick child. And what's with Sophie flip-flopping from old woman, to young girl, back to somewhere in between? If it weren't for the genius animation, I'd have given this 2 stars. Okay, so it's a little entertaining, but if Hayao Myazaki would have stuck to the original story, he'd have struck gold!"
5,What a wicked movie! (kids review),i thought this movie was an awesome movie! It was one of my favorites out of all the myuzaki movies. Well almost. And what a spectacular ending. Usually the characters wouldn't kiss at the end but in this one it shocked me. I'm fourteen and do not think kissing was disgusting.
5,studio ghibli will always be my #1 anime producers,In my opinion all the ghibli films should be own by all anime fans. Unlike most animated films on the market today films such as these provide a deep story and meaning. Keep it up Ghibli!!:)
5,Best Miyazaki Movie!,I love Howl's Moving Castle and finally bought the DVD this year as a birthday gift for myself. My husband (who is not an anime fan) watched it with me. He said that he would never have sought it out on his own but that he really enjoyed it. The story and artwork are superb. I also read and loved the book on which the film is based. The plot is romantic and funny and fantastical and sometimes dark and brooding. The voices are performed by some of the top actors and actresses in Hollywood. I can't recommend this movie too highly!
4,a masterpiece from miyazaki,"I enjoyed the more casual style story telling in this movie, where the plot doesn't have to revolve around the conflict between good and evil.It's a story about a girl and her adventures while living inside a moving castle. that's it.Very eye pleasing artworks, good soundtrack, comic relief fire demon, and a grand finale for those who needs a climax. Even though it gets a little draggy at times, Howl's Moving Castle has something for everyone."
2,Pretty Disappointing.,"I am a huge fan of anything written by Diana Wynne Jones, so I was extremely excited when I heard that one of my favorite directors was making her book Howl's Moving Castle into a movie. However, I was very disappointed with how it came out. Miyazaki totally butchered the story by adding in an unnessary and unexplained war that just further complicated the plot. It was also unfortunate to see him reuse so many visuals from his other movies. It would have been a much better and cohesive movie if he had just stuck to the plot of the book instead of changing it around. All in all, I think that if I had not read the book first before seeing the movie I would have maybe liked it better. Oh, well."
4,Good movie,I found the movie visually stunning. Especially the background. One scene had me thinking of Monet. The castle itself was wonderful. I also liked Howl's bedroom with all the gewgaws around the room. Fantastic! The story itself was just so-so. I did like the soundtrack.
5,Simply awesome...,"My brother doesnt even like these type of movies and he really enjoyed them. I liked the storyline. Coming from someone who is relatively new to Miyazaki's work, the way he portrayed the love is nice. It wasn't unbelieveable. It was refreshing.Christian Bale is the voice of Howl-the young, conceided magician who falls in love with Emily Mortimer as Sophie-the young turned old girl(by a spell). THey have up and downs just as anyone normal person.My favorite part was where Howl has a tantrum because Sophie rearranged his maigc potions in the bathroom. He runs down the stairs saying ""What's the use of living if I can't be beautiful?"".Anyways, I strongly recommend this for everyone."
5,Beautiful,"Howl's Moving Castle was the third movie that I watched of Miyazaki's movies I believe. Every one of his movies has touched me in some way and I love them all. This one in particular is very beautiful. I guess being of his newer ones, it's visuals and stunning art is astounding. It took me a couple of times of watching to actually grasp the whole plot of the story and to understand what was going on. This movie is surely a Miyazaki classic and will catch the hearts of children and adults. If you love Miyazaki films you won't be disappointed."
5,Amazing film from an amazing director,"I was blown away by the quality of this film. I think Miyazaki is a master of his craft, and his films have such spirit and beauty. I wish an american director could take the reigns on an animated picture like this. If you've been acquanted with this man's work, you'll know that it will be a fantasy tale. At first, it will seem the film is geared toward a younger crowd, in fact there are some very adult themes, such as overcoming one's inner demons of fear, greed, accepting ones age and inevitable death, and the power of love. The animation is just gorgeous. The landscapes are wonderous, and the characters are three dimensional. You'll find yourself laughing at certain characters ideosyncracies, and relating, even though this is of eastern influence. The running time is long, which is great because you wont want the film to end. Take time with the film, soak everything in. If you love anime movies, this is a great choice for you."
5,"""Howl's Moving Castle"" is Highly Recomended!!!","I, personally, thought this was the best film ever creatated. It easily replaced ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" as my favorite (which is hard to do). I'm now reading the book, which is equally enjoyable. I implore you to see and read it.The story takes place in a little world, slightly different from our own, focusing on a young woman named Sophie. Her boring job as a hatter is pushed aside by a magic-filled job as Wizard Howl's old cleaning lady when the horrid Witch of the Waste turns her into an old woman. Sophie's more adventurous as an old woman, which comes in handy as she bargins with Howl and a fire demon, cleans green slime (that's my favorite part!!!), and befriends not only Howl's apprentice and a jumping scarecrow, but also the Witch of the Waste herself!!! (P.S. Howl is AWSOME!!!)"
2,"Poor copy, great movie",The DVD that I received seems to have multiple missing frames or skips compared to the japanese original. I suspect Disney is to blame as the physical media doesn't have any defects that I can spot by eye.
5,Howl's Moving Castle,I really liked this movie. The director has a real flare.It kept me going right to the end. I cant wait to see more from this director.
3,Completely Different From the Book!,"If you're looking for a film version of Dianna Wynne Jones' novel, don't see this movie. Except for the main characters (and not even all of those) and a few details about the castle and the world, the storyis entirely different. Sophie's sisters are not a part of the plot. The Witch of the Waste is quickly turned into a harmless old woman. The movie focuses on a war between the kingdoms (what kingdoms?) complete with bomb-dropping airships. And Howl is in danger of permanently transforming into a big bird. Right... As a fan of both Jones and Miyazaki I was sadly disappointed by this movie. Miyazaki makes better, more cohesive movies when he is working with his own material. While the animation is still delightful, the storyline is jumpy and incoherent. If you do watch the movie, try to completely dissociate it from the book and enjoy it purely as a whimsical Miyazaki film."
4,New Classic,"This movie is like no other, totally a must see and a must own. Great for adults and youth"
5,Watch more than Once,The first time you see this the visual will distract you and you will find your self glued to the screen.. There are a few elements which feel unfinished but everyone has commented on those already... So for little kids and adults alike this one works.. It will become a family favorite for sure...
3,Not one of his best movies!,I have mixed feelings about this film. I'm not a big fan of Howl! The film had plenty of action and drama but I couldn't swallow some aspects of this film. It strives to be real concerning the but ends up naseauting toward the end!I think when anime tries to make it's characters more real it seems more surreal! I love the visuals I just couldn't stomache the characterization. Definitely not his best film!
1,This is not the same story...,"A caveat for anyone who has read Diana Wynne Jone's book, from which this movie was supposedly adapted - this is not the same story. The only thing that remains of the original tale of Howl's moving castle are the names of the characters. Everything else has changed - including the characters themselves, the plot and the entire storyline."
1,Choose the book not the movie,"If you have read the book *and liked it*, then i recommend that you don't watch this movie. It shares very few things in common with the book, one of which is the title. The plot is almost completely different. It was like the director read the back of the book and then made up a new story."
1,Utter rubbish that is an insult to the author,"I have seen a lot of movies that did not translate well from the books, but this director has taken so much liberty with the story that I would not even call it an adaptation. It's more like a theft of title and main character names. Diana Wynne Jones's book has very well-developed characters, mysteries that reveal themselves as the book progresses, and an interesting twist at the end, none of which has been preserved in this movie. The entire interesting plot has been omitted in favor of eye candy that doesn't have roots in the book."
4,Howls Moving Castle,This was actually a cool movie .. I bought it for my daughter and watched it with her several times .. definitely a good kids movie.
3,alternative world magic fantasy,The film is a Japanese animation with an all star voice over cast.A young girl is cursed by a witch to look like a grandmother.She wonders out of the wasteland into Howl's moving castle.When she is asleep she reverts to her true beautiful form.Howl is a wizard who pretends to be two different peoplein the 19th century like world.There is a dreadful war with strange air machines bombing the cities.In the middest of this Howl and Sophie fall in love with each otherin what seems to be a doomed romance of a grandmother witha failing wizard.The movie is a fun and colorful animationthat I enjoyed.
5,Great Movie!,"My boys love this movie!! -- Because they are young, 3 & 6, I was a little concerned that the ""blob men"" (black, gooey, tar-like bad guys) might be a little scary for them. But they were so captivated by the actual ""moving castle"" (which is kind of robot-like on the outside & normal house on the inside), Calcifer (the talking fire) & Turnip-Head (the scarecrow) they didn't pay much mind to the rest. -- The graphics and music are absolutely beautiful! Something the whole family can enjoy!"
5,"Great Film, not to be missed","Howl's Moving Castle is a tale full of action, adventure and of corse romantic. The best films always have all these elements and Howl's Moving Castle is no exception. From begining to end it's a playground for the eyes and it is a tale that will warm your heart. Mr. Miazaki does it again, two thumbs way up for this fantastic film. Don't miss it."
5,Miyazaki is simply the best,"I cannot think of an animation company in our time who has more imagination and talent than Studio Ghibli. Miyazaki's works are simply the best.My favorite stories by Studio Ghibli have been ""Tenku no Shiro Laputa"" for its quality science fiction/fantasy tale, and ""Tonari no Totoro"" for its look at childhood.While this one is quite different in what it explores and the way it does it, I really like Howl's Moving Castle as well. I think Studio Ghibli films create likable characters and interesting stories and Howl's Moving Castle is no exception.Also, as a Japanese speaker, I am thankful to have the original Japanese version included on the DVD.This is an excellent story put out by the premier animators of our day."
5,Spellbinding,"I've enjoyed exploring several Miyazaki animated films with my daughter, and this is one of the best of the best although it's not based on an original story by Miyazaki. We've seen Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind, Laputa: Castle in the Sky, My Neighbor Totoro (Totoro and the cat bus are delightful), Kiki's Delivery Service, Spirited Away, and now Howl's Moving Castle. I've also screened Princess Mononoke, which contains a few scenes that are too violent for my seven-year-old. Our top two are Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle, with Nausicaa, Laputa and Totoro a small step down (although better than most everything else out there)."
5,The whole family loves it!,My 11 year old daughter stumbled upon this movie on cabel one weekend. We found out it was a book and both read it. I bought my daughter the book and the movie and she introduced my 15 year old niece to Howl and it was a hit. Even my 18 year old nephew was entertained by the Japanese Animation :)
5,pleased,My daughter requested this product ordered. She was extremely pleased with it and would order from seller again in the future.
5,best movie ever!,i love this movie. the graphics the art the meaning of the movie is fantastic. i also read the book and fell in love. for once i love the book and the movie
5,A Must Have!,"I saw this movie a couple years ago and bought it for the kids after they fell in love with ""Ponyo"". They love this one too. So do I for that matter! If you like the family anime then this is a must have!"
2,waste of time,"Ridiculous storyline, with characters morphing back and forth, with no clear-cut reason for the timing or purpose. The preposterous ""castle,"" which could have been formed by a giant snowball rolling through a waste dump, has doors conveniently opening into alternate realities, providing convenient escapes for the author's story running into otherwise dead ends. One worthy story item--the hero is shown totally exhausted, emotionally and physically, after flying endlessly, saving the world. NOT up to Miyazaki's usual works."
1,Too Weird for Me,"So many people love and fawn over Japanese animation that I know I'm setting myself up as a target when I say... ugh. Save for the music which was great, I had to force myself to get through this movie. As usual, it looked like the director took 6 different animators, put them in 6 different rooms with 6 different scripts and then patchworked it together. Throw in a few fat women and weird monsters that turn into people and visa versa and voila... you get this movie and countless others just like it. Give me Don Bluth instead."
3,"good, but is in spanish","Ok this movie rocks, just be aware of the fact that it is in spanish, it is my fault for not noticing, i just don't want anyone else messing up like me :)"
3,Just OK,My 3 yr old loves this case but its kinda pointless in my opinion... the zipper is really hard to do and there is no wrist strap... fine for my daughter because she doesn't know any better but im not 100% satisfyed...
5,Lovey's Gift to 4 year old granddaughter,My granddaughter was so excited to receive this camera. She took pictures with it everywhere we went. It is so easy to use that her 2 year old sister easily learned how to take cute photos as well.
2,camera case for Fisher Price camera,The prodcut was shipped in a timely manner.I was very disappointed over the fact that there was no handle or neck strap for a child to be able to carry it around with.We actually were able to make a nice strap that hangs from around the neck and attaches to the case via velcro.I would have thought fisher price would have already thought of doing something like this.
4,Another camera saved,"I was delighted to find this Fisher Price Camera Case. We bought the camera for a very active 4 year old granddaughter, but then couldn't find a case to protect it. Our granddaughter loves feeling ""grown-up' and carrying her camera around in it's pink case. (Thank heavens, because she is quite rough with it) And Pink makes it wonderful to her. The case is strong and very durable. We were also pleased with the quick shipment."
5,very nice movie,"i saw tha movie last week and i can say that i liked it a lot.its very funny.but i realize i say the same things with the others. so i ll tell something different,as i am greek living in athens i must say that greeks are not like this anymore,like the ""portokalos"" family.maybe you can find such familys in the villages.i am looking forward the dvd.sorry about my english.steve/athens"
5,SEE IT! Hilarious and Warm-Hearted!,"This movie is the best feel good family film to come out in a while. In a time when people need to laugh, this one hits the spot. Saw it few times and keep bringing ""converts"". I'm not greek, but this is really about ANY family who loves each other despite all those crazy things a family can do to each other to drive each other crazy. GO SEE IT!"
5,Too Hilarious!,I saw this movie while on a cruise and it was just too hilarious. The whole audience kept laughing. The great thing about this movie is that everyone can relate to the family no matter what your culture is. This is a must see for all ages and a must buy and watch everyday. I highly reccomend it. One of the best movies I've seen in a long while.
4,Big Fat Movie,"Great movie. Every time that you watch this movie you will see more things going on in the background that you missed. Who doesn't know a family like this. This is kinda a chick flick, but it is great!"
5,Rolling On The Floor With LAUGHTER!,"WARNING TO THE VIEWER:It is NOT ADVISED to view this comedy movie with a FULL BLADDER, lest you EMBARRASS YOURSELF.-------------------------------------------------One of the funniest movies I've ever seen in my life. Very true to life, this flick is about two cultures coming together, all because a boy & girl fall in love with each other!Laughter is GOOD MEDICINE for the soul (and body)! If you can sit through this movie without hysterical laughter, then you will be the first. It has NEVER been done!Have you married someone who comes from another ethnic culture? If so, you'll LOVE this movie! Remember when you knew nothing about the other's traditions?Get ready for the funniest comedy you'll probably ever see! Hysteria, laughter, and possibly losing 5 lbs of fat, and all from merely watching a very funny flick!!"
2,Transparent Sitcom,"This is the highest-grossing romantic comedy ever. And it's a bellwether as to why the movie-viewing audience shouldn't be trusted with sharp objects.I stopped watching television a couple of years ago out of disgust with how transparent TV sitcoms are. Everything proceeds in a linear manner, utterly predictable; anyone watching closely will know what the closing punch line will be within the first five minutes. And this movie is nothing but an extended situation comedy.It has good visuals, admittedly, and a broader palette than low budgets permit sitcoms, but its narrative structure and character development could have been done by the creative team at UPN. And I never really did care about the characters or what happened to them; I never overcame the notion that they were self-centered no-accounts.Don't waste your time with this claptrap. If you feel you absolutely must watch something of this breed, it will come to your house for free if you just turn on network television."
4,My Big Fat Greek Wedding,It was really funny and I would recommend it to all my friends for a good laugh.
3,An nice little movie but too cute for my taste,"It's easy to see why My Big Fat Greek Wedding has struck such a chord with movie goers. It's about an underdog who perseveres despite the obstacles that she has to overcome, most of which are placed squarely in front of her by her family. Much of it is sweet and well meaning, much of it is also broad cultural stereotypes. Not offensive per se, but stereotypical to be sure. This movie is a bit like Cinderella on Ouzo. A formula story, a happy ending and a bit of a hangover afterwards"
2,My Big Fat Greek Waste of Time,"While this movie was technically done well, I just hated it. There were no issues with plausibility or lapses in plot line. Cinematography and all aspects were good. My beef is with the story.I just didn't care. The director and the writer did a lousy job of making me care about any character at all. I didn't laugh even once while watching this movie. I didn't think anything presented was new or novel or innovative in any way shape or form.For the life of me I can't understand why so many people rave about this film. Knowing what I know now, I would rather read product labels on household cleaners than watch this movie.I appreciate all the hard work that went in to this movie. I know everyone was a professional and did well. I just absolutely positively hated the story."
3,"Not bad, but kind of disappointing","Maybe it's because I heard so many good comments on it that my expectations were too high, but I found this movie kind of disappointing. It doesn't have a strong plot and keeps you kind of bored. It is a bit funny though and I would recommend it if you have nothing better to do. I don't think it's worth the buy though."
2,The strong will make it through,"This movie is hyped up by the advertisements, but all in all, it was very slow and not well thought out. The families are very unbelievealbe. I verly made it through the whole thing."
3,A little disappointing...,"after all the hype! It was just not that funny. I may have laughed 3 times, maybe!! The movie is very predictable, kinda corny and lacks real romance between the characters. Her family was a hoot, but just not enough to take me over the top."
2,"Good theme, mediocre execution","The idea is, i suppose, to celebrate the way love brings together families from different ethnic backgrounds. The children go along tolerantly with the domineering Greek family, and this is supposed to warm our hearts. But somehow this strikes me as a single-joke comedy, and the joke in itself is not hilarious--unless you are a Greek EXTREMELY attached to Greek traditions."
5,Witty and hilarious as well as refreshingly original,"Being of mixed race myself, my family resembles a lot in this movie. My mother's large, loving and loud Hispanic family resembles Toula's large, loving and loud Greek family, while my dad's small, conventional, quiet Caucasian family represents Ian's small, conventional, quiet Caucasian family. ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" was delightful and charming. Full of wit, humor, and a very upbeat, positive attitude, this is the ideal movie to watch when you're in the mood for a big smile."
5,LAUGHED SO HARD!,"THIS WAS THE BEST COMEDY I'VE SEEN IN YEARS! ""LAUGH OUT LOUD FUNNY""!!!!! I'M HEADED BACK TO THE THEATRE TO SEE IT AGAIN TOMORROW........CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS ONE.....IT WAS GREAT!"
1,Sets comedy back 30 years,"If I wanted to be dragged through something so smarmy and predictable, I would have just found a re-run of ""My three son's"" on TV. This movie reminded me of the laugh-track sit-coms of the 60's which, at the time, were great time-killers between the end of school and dinner(F-troop, where are you?) but at the time, all I ventured was time. I guess it shouldn't, but it does amaze me that it did so well. If you like Gilligan's island, or I dream of Jeannie, go for it. But if your tastes have moved on, don't waste your time or your money on this."
1,Hmmm?,Well my sister and I thought that this movie ws pretty bad. i mean we didnt like the whole plot or the humor. Although evveryone else liked it we didnt think it was that great of a movie....
1,Big Disappointment,I was looking forward to watching this movie--but turned it off after about 30 minutes. Pure TV sitcom schlock--not a believable character in the show. And what was with the fright wig on Tula in the beginning?
1,Disappointed,"I bought the DVD without seeing the movie. I was very disappointed after all the hype. It was predictable and had nothing special about it. It was like watching an ""after school special"". I found it to be terribly dull. For those that are considering buying the movie I recommend renting it first unless you want to make room for a DVD that you will never watch again."
2,Big Fat Stereotypes!,"Warning to those not of Greek descent. As a child of immigrant parents, I know the world of this film intimately and can thus justifiably say without reservation that it distorts all the genuine aspects of the Greek-American experience in favor of cheap laughs due to easy ethnic stereotypes and standard Hollywood cliches. Many of the central characters are not played by Greeks, and their portrayals come off as phony as their accents, especially Andrea Martin. In fact, almost the entire movie fails to capture Greekness in any real sense, with the only exception of the hard-headed father's cold relationship with his artistically inclined son. Forget this movie and see MONSOON WEDDING instead: it is everything that MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING should have been."
1,"Oh, I was hoping for more.","I really wanted to enjoy this movie. My wife loved it with her friends and it sounded to be a winner. But to no avail. This movie was not that funny and certainly is not hilarious. It was interesting to see a culture clash, but I've seen many more movies that at leasted hooked me.I never felt much of a relationship developed between Toula and Ian. It just happened. For a rather well hyped movie by word of mouth, this really left me disappointed. Such a shame, because there is lots of potential material here."
1,Boring and Unfunny Load of [stuff],"Hype,Hype,Hype! Without the name-cache of Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson and the lazy tastes of many women in this wonderful country overblown stereotypical impersonations of Greek-Americans though, I have to give it that. What an accomplishment! What it isn't is at all humorous. Everytime the smart lady I saw this movie with looked at me with her eyebrows raised (without even a smile on her face -and she is a very funny person who loves to laugh)"
2,Different strokes for different folks,"I went to this movie wanting to love it. I left disappointed and feeling like I needed a Valium to relax me after enduring two hours (or however long it was)of that loud, rambunctious family. Like I said, I wanted to love this movie, but I didn't. I didn't like it. It does have some funny lines and moments, but overall, it got on my nerves big time.I also could never quite believe that gorgeous John Corbet would fall for that girl. He is way out of her league.I'm glad that millions of people enjoyed this movie. I'm sorry, but I did not."
1,movie bad,"This movie is the reason I couldn't give 1 star to the Royal Tennenbaums. While both are painfully unfunny ""comedies"" about family life, Tennenbaums at least is a bit imaginitive. This is like watching a long, bad comedy routine by one of those untalented, solipsistic thirty somethings that always seem to end up plugging up the stand-up blocks on the Comedy Channel. How pathetic and childish! This movie would make a bad episode of Doctor Katz. Plus it co-stars the ""Ford Guy"", the worst corporate spokesman in recent memory, as the great WASP Prince. Ugly! I'd like to say that this movie was insulting and unrealistic, but going by it's popularity, I guess I'm the one being unrealistic because people are really this shallow. Even when they're trying their best to express themselves. Sad."
1,Funny ugly duckling becomes preening swan.,"I do not understand the appeal of this movie. The lead character is somewhat interesting as the ugly duckling but annoyingly plastic and one-dimentional as the made-over swan. To miss this, you had to check out half way through this silly movie."
1,I was greatly disappointed,"I purchased this DVD without having seen the movie based on all the hype it was getting in the press and on the internet. I wish now that I hadn't wasted my money. Not only are the characters not particularily likeable but the plot moves with funeral speed from one supposedly funny scene to another. The only thing I found humerous abot the movie was the continula reference to Windex as an all purpose cleaner and cure, but even that got very stale with endless repetition.I don't know why so many people liked this movie so much. I found it lacking and wish that there was a no star rating available for this review."
4,It's Fun !!,"Despite her family's expectation that downtrodden Toula would never find a man, she transforms herself, falls in love and marries. The survival of that relationship through the trials of a big Greek wedding provide humourous moments and insights into her family and his very different family. Romantic and very pleasant watching."
3,Predictable plot; hilarious dialogue,"The ending of the movie is very predictable and the story is not very unique: It's a simple story of a thirtysomething woman whose entire family is over-proud of their Grecian heritage. She finally falls in love with someone, but he isn't a ""nice Greek boy"" like her family wants. And, of course, to keep the girl, he must please the family by following their Grecian ways. Predictable? Yes.Another odd thing about the movie is the father's Windex gag (which is very funny, but I doubt Windex would ever work on real cuts and bruises). Nevertheless, it's a great comedy with plenty of laughs. I'd recommend it not for the story, but for comedy behind it all."
2,movie watcher,"like other reviews, i thought this movie was entertaining, but not worth buying or renting. i don't understand why people are so ""gung ho"" on this one. i would of rather seen it on cable."
3,My Big Fat Greek Wedding,"This movie takes every stereotypical assumption you ever had about Greek people, and multiplies it for this laugh out loud satire. Toula has been ruled by her dominating family her whole life, but when she starts seeing, and later gets engaged to Ian Miller, both are determined not to let anyone interfere. What a great romantic comedy, but since there is also a fair amount of drama, I may have classified it incorrectly. Both the acting and script were very well done."
3,"cute, entertaining, but not superfantastic","Just saw it for the first time. My opinion? Funny without being hilarious, charming (but not TOO charming), cute and heartwarming...but somehow not quite as funny or endearing as I expected, from all the rave reviews it's gotten. The bad? Tired storylines, borderline cliche. The good? Great cast performances, enough good quotable lines to make the cliche-bordering forgivable. (What do you mean he don't eat no meat??) I had a good time watching it. Three out of five stars."
4,expected more..... but funny... not overly funny..,"I rented this movie after hearing all the ""hype"" surrouding this movie, that was supposidly great, and super funny, ect...I also have a thing for ""wedding"" themed movies..So, The movie seemed to drag at parts... but WAS funny, but not super funny like I thought it would be.It was a good movie, don't get me wrong.. but I think monsoon wedding was much better.."
4,Great On So Many Levels,"This movie was one of the best I have seen in a long, long time. It was not only hilarious and kept me laughing throughout, but it was romantic and unpredictible. It really showed how important family is, while keeping it light-hearted and funny. My only complaint is that the DVD did not have many extras. Although the fact that ""Greek"" subtitles are included was very funny, but that and a scene selection was about all that was included and I am very dissapointed because I would loved to have seen some bloopers!! Overall, though, the movie was fantastic and everyone who wants a movie that isn't overly sexy and that is hilarious and wholesome should definetly check this out!!"
4,Good Clean Greek Fun,"I love that a movie can be this entertaining and still have a PG rating. The story is simple, Toula is Greek from a family steeped in tradition and she breaks from that. First by wanting an education and second by not wanting to work at the family business. So naturally it follws that she wants to marry a man who is **gasp** NOT Greek. The movie is funny and vastly entertaining because of the very talented actors who have superb comic timing. Nia Vardalos and John Corbett and a host of other fine actors do a great job of telling every bride's story and all of us who've had that big, fat, family made, wedding will certainly connect with it. This IS a must see movie, but rent it before buying it. While this is an excellent movie, it's not a story that hasn't been told before or won't be told again. You may find that having seen it once you don't really need to see it again. Besides, the story continues every Sunday night on CBS."
2,My Big Fat Greek Wedding,I donno......Did I miss the point of this movie....I meant most of it was pointless jokes poking fun of the people who aren't greek....I personally didn't find it amusing.....the old grandma did get me going a few times but that's about it.....I don't think it's worth your time and the movie isn't all it's hyped up 2 be
3,Not worth all the hype,"I waited to watch this movie until it was available in stores. The first few times I tried to rent it, every copy was out. When I finally did get home and watch it, I have to say, I was less than impressed with the movie.It's an average romantic-comedy. It has funny moments. It has stupid moments. And some very predictable moments.All in all, I think you have to be Greek in order to find this movie as hysterical as most people said it was."
2,Not that funny!,This movie was boring! this movie dragged! and to much hype for nothing! also made to much money..... FO WHAT!**
4,YES IT'S GREAT BUT...,"I guess everything I had heard about this film from friends, critics, talk shows, and all the rest of the Media, made me anticipate being totally blown away by it. Well, I wasn't. I really enjoyed it, and it was definitely ""cute"", but I've seen lots of other films that really did blow me away compared to this one."
4,"Great Movie, but forced to watch trailers and adds","If the technology involved with this DVD is hint of what is to come, then I say bravo to pirates. Having PAID for this DVD I do not see why I cannot bypass an advetisement and many trailers before seeing the movie. I can hardly wait to burn my own edition without all that trash.The film itself, is delightful and worth the watch."
4,VERY Good,"I thoguht the movie was very good. It wasn't rolling on the floor laughing but it had some very funny parts to it. The characters were easy to relate to and they seemed very real as opposed to the usual Hollywood ""fakeness"". Overall, this movie is for anyone who wants to see a cute movie and wants a bunch of good laughs."
5,Awesome Movie,"Even for me, a guy who normally likes shoot 'em up action films, I found this film really warming. It wasn't smarmy or tacky like a lot of chick flicks I've seen (or been forced to see). This is really has a great story and there's no wondering why it did so well in the movie theaters."
3,Fun but uninteresting,"I looked forward to this movie because of all the word of mouth from people who loved it, but came away disappointed. As someone who has struggled with the clash of cultures I found the movie to be very whitebread.The fiancee has no spine, personality or interests and is simply absorbed by the big, fat, Greek family without a struggle. It had all the drama of a cow eating grass.It is a shame. The movie made some nice points about not letting your background control your future but letting it be a part of your future. If they had explored these ideas further the movie would have been funny and interesting."
3,Cute but overrated,"Fairly good movie, but after all the talk, it was a big let down. It's nothing more than a better than average romantic comedy - and that's only because of all the the really bad movies out there."
4,Family Hilarity,"This hilarious movie depicts the tale of a family oriented Greek-American gal who struggles to find her own identity amongst her role in her family. She along the way falls in love with the charming American played by John Corbett. She and Corbett begin to date and navigate their way through religious traditions and surviving a large family. There isn't a character in this movie that you won't be able to either identify with or go he/she reminds me of....My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a cute comedy to be enjoyed by all. It can serve as a wonderful family movie, a date night in movie, or just a good movie to watch on your own."
3,OK for cuddling your wife/girlfriend...,... but you do wonder when the film is going to start and then its over ... ok Greek people are different ......would have been better with more Turks!...funny in little snippets but not rib-tickling... a sweet film but not a patch on Strictly Ballroom
1,Don't believe the hype,"I disliked this movie intensely for one main reason, It's story was like a rejected sitcom pilot. The jokes and situations were so predictable and lame that I could actually say the jokes before the actors.There could have been a much better story there if only it was cultivated and polished with a little more care.I found the stereotyping of Greek and English family life offensive and inaccurate. Being familiar with both cultures, I feel I am right in my assessment.If you are looking for a basic story, with below average acting and writing, then perhaps you will enjoy this film. I for one, thought it was incredibly, unbelievably bad."
1,Big fat bore,"I sure wish I had paid attention to the negative reviews before I bought this. I'm as much a fan of romances, Cinderella stories, and light comedy as the next person. I enjoyed Sleepless in Seattle and Moonstruck, among others. But My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a big fat waste of time and money. The story is empty, dull, routine, and devoid of charm, despite the appealing cast (who were wasted in this dud of a screenplay.) It was like watching romance for the Romper Room set - there was no subtlety at all, no rich threads running throughout the plot, just a dull, straightforward tale that I didn't want to see through to the end. Even the Cinderella part of the story was over in the span of 5 minutes - she put on some new clothes and makeup and voila, a lifetime of feeling left out and she was completely transformed. And 5 minutes later, the man of her dreams was hers, just like that. I didn't laugh, I didn't cry, I just wondered when it would get interesting. It never did."
3,Overhyped,"Great acting (Lainie Kazan and Michael Constantine are especially terrificin an over-the-top way) but a somewhat simple story-boy (whose only distinguishing trait is being a vegetarian) meets girl (whose overbearing, overdramatic family worships its ethnic heritage above all things--substitute any ethnic/religious/family name for Greek) and they get married. The overbearing, neurotic father finally accepts the infidel into the family and buys them a house for a wedding present...of course, right next door to his own. Not the comedy I was expecting. I laughed, I think, four times."
2,if it hadn't been a harmless comedy...,"I would be insulted if I were Greek. My best friend is Greek and I've never been around him or anyone in his Greek community that had ever uttered ""opa"" when excited. In fact, I met two visiting Greek M.D.'s who were appalled and furious that a Greek American would portray other Greek Americans this way. Yes, in the end, it's really a very harmless movie pandering to the WASP mainstream. And I'm sure it's hard to sell an ethnic movie in Hollywood, but can't someone please come up with something that doesn't have to make themselves act like cardboard stereotypes to get a laugh. Or may be at least watch Annie Hall a couple of times to learn how to do the ethnic parody thing properly."
1,A huge disappointment.,I watched this movie hoping it would live up to all the hype and it didn't. The only funny part about this movie was the old Grandmother from Greece sneaking out of the house and drinking. This was a sad remake of the dorky girl get's the guy kind of movie. I made the mistake of buying it before renting it and now it just collects dust!
2,"Light hearted entertaining, but....","not as polished (technically, as well as artistically) as some of the romantic comedies of the past. Could have been REALLY good had it not fallen to the tried and true, hollywood formula. Predictable."
1,"Vulgar, full of cheap sex jokes and racist humor","All of the characters in this film commit blasphemy in the big church desecration scene that should scare off parents interested in a good family film. The orgy scene at the Greek restaurant was tasteless and unnecessary. I enjoyed the crude joke about the donkey but thought they went too far during the ""diaper"" party. Offensive to the max but the lead actress was a babe."
4,"I do, I do!","I do love this movie. The first time I saw it, I had mixed feelings. Then I saw it again...and again. Now, I love it. Nia Vardalos (Toulah) is beautiful and shines in this romantic comedy. John Corbett (Ian) is so sweet; makes me wish all men were like that. Why did this movie do so well? Because there is something of everyone in it. We can all relate on some level. This is one of the ultimate 'chick flicks,' but men can get laughs out of it as well. See the movie, laugh. See it again, laugh. And add it to your collection. Dreams do come true, at least in this story. It's wonderful."
3,Not bad for a chick flick,"Since I've been getting really bored of romantic comedies lately, I hadn't bothered to see this one, but then my mum brought it home on video and I figured I'd give it a go.It was all right, really. Good points are (1) the characters seem more quirky and less perfect than in a lot of rom-coms (2) there are some genuinely funny pieces of dialogue (3) it's nice if you believe in romantic love and the power of marriage. The bad points are (1) it's a bit of a one-joke pony in that you can get sort of tired of the 'wacky-Greek' humour after a while (2) the plot is not that great; there's no story arc and the conflict is minimal.Overall, it's a fun movie, and I'd recommend it if you like chick flicks and romantic comedies, as it's by no means the worst out there. But rent it to fill up an afternoon with a bit of fun - don't go to it expecting power and majesty."
5,A Wonderful Surprise!,"I had never even heard about this movie until a good month after it was released and my mother in law recommended seeing it. She told me it was one of the funniest movies she has seen in a long time. Later that week I saw promotion for it on television and decided to give it a try. My husband who normally isnt into romantic comedies, laughed himself silly. It is hands down, the best movie we saw in the past year. The characters are lovable and endearing. The jokes are hilarious. The story is sweet. You get a look into Greek-American culture, something most of us know little about, and gain a new fondness for it. In short, I highly recommend this movie! I am going to buy the DVD ASAP!"
3,An Enchanting Cinderella type comedy,"You find don't many PG, funny, family comedies anymore, but I was thouroughly pleased with this movie! It was funny, witty and enchanting. If you liked The Princess Diaries, Maid in Manhattan, or Ever After, you'll love this movie!"
3,Big Fat Greek,"This is a very interesting piece of work. To me this film was like meeting a new family. You watch this the first time and you think, man, these guys are wierd. Don't get me wrong Im not bashing the greeks. My wife is part greek. Im just saying if you can stand to watch it a few times you get more used to it and it grows on you a little bit.This is story about a girl who is fed greek from the time she left the womb. She gets really sick of it and it shows. She finally decides to start living the life that she wants and falls in love with a man who is not greek. This is a big no no in her family. So they go through the routine and he gets bapised and they get married in the church.This film was acclaimed and I expected it to be more comical than it was, but it is a film that was well done and to some it may be a blockbuster."
5,Super Movie,"This movie kicked .... Of all the romantic comedies I've seen, this one's my favorite, along with Bridget Jone's Diary. When I first saw it in the theater, there was a family of a dozen Greeks sitting in front of us, making the movie all the more enjoyable to hear their comments, throughout...(I think it may have hit a little too close to home.) I loved it, and I will always have those funny memories from the first time I saw it. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. Go Nia!"
4,"Refreshing, Delightful and funny!","This was refreshing, in that it gave insight into a culture and the values of a Greek family and their daughter and her marriage. I didn't leave my seat throughout the entire movie as it kept me in such an upbeat mood. The star and co-star were perfect as the bride and groom! A must see!"
5,Greek Cinderella,"4.5 stars. One of my favorites-mainly because I'm a sucker for good romance movies-the cheesier, the better. Vardalos, in my humble opinion, was very brave to go on camera without her makeup. This movie gave hope to a lot of plain Janes when Toula captured the heart of Ian. (John Corbett from Sex and the City Fame). Her loud, overbearing and obnoxious family are adorable in their own way. Overall, highly recommended."
4,Big fat greek fun,"OK, my family is a little crazy like this, but we are not greek, so i can totally relate to this story. It's a very fun and hilarious story centered around a wedding, obviously. The characters are fun and lovable for their humor. If you have a big and outspoken family, you will certainly enjoy this movie."
4,Entertaining but not as great as people are saying,"This movie was ""ok"" but not great. Michael Constantine steals the movie about a nerdy girl who works in a travel agency. One day she is attracted to a man that looks in. The man happened to be someone she waited on in her father's Greek restaurant. She decides to pretty herself up and then starts to date the man.There is a clash of culture as his family is definately not Greek. The Greek family is shown to be very large and fun going while the young man's family is very stiff and proper.The highlight of the movie is the constant wanderings of the girl's grandmother and her father's constant insistance that every word in the English language comes from a Greek root.I liked it but I was not overwhelmed by it like some people. Still it is better than a lot of the new movies out there."
5,GREAT!!!,A Classic comedy to add to your movie library. Nia is a gem and a movie you will want to watch over and time again.
2,Just couldn't get into it...,"I think I was a victim of the media hype here... maybe this could have been an enjoyable film, but I simply couldn't get into it... it was not at all what I expected. I found the characters dull and a bit annoying and needy, and the stereotypes were a bit too thick for my tastes."
5,Any woman who is not Anglo-Saxon will relate!,"The opening of this movie had me hooked. Any woman from Middle-Eastern, Italian, and Greek backgrounds will appreciate this movie. I love the line, ""I was a swarthy six-year-old with sideburns."" LOL...I've been there.Nia Vardalos is not your typical Hollywood actress. She is pretty in a unique, ethnic sort of way. She is funny, down-to-Earth, and really brings heart to her character. The supporting cast is phenomenal...I laughed through the whole thing!This movie is fantastic. I saw it in the theater and now I own it. It's funny, warm, touching, and very human. I highly recommend it."
3,Over sold!!!,I was disappointed in this movie. I had heard so much about it and was excited when it was released on DVD. What a let down. The humor was hard to find. John Corbett was the only thing worth watching about this movie. Save your money.
