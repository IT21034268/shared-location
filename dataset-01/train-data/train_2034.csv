5,Hmm...,"Alot of people say Kid Rock can no longer rock after this cd. I totally disagree. Did you not realize Cocky was his last ""white-trash"" album? He is now done with hiphop and I thought everyone who liked him knew he was turning southern rock/country. Its not my favorite type of music, But putting that fact aside, This cd gets a 5 from me. It is a master peice. He will get more bad reviews than good because he done something he wanted to do and not what others wanted to him to do, But oh well.All in all, It deserves atleast 4 from anyone when judged in music and not their personal taste."
5,Excellent CD! I LOVE IT!,"Nothing like good ol' American Rock & Roll!!! Way better than Cocky, not the Rap/Rock of Devil, but as any Kid Rock fan knows, he's going to change it up. I'm a HUGE Bobby fan and he did not disappoint me this time around.If you like classic or southern rock, country and maybe even a little honky tonk, you'll love this album. There are appearances by Billy Gibbons, Kenny Wayne Shepperd and Sheryl Crow to give you an idea of the flavor of this CD. ""Black Bob"" is cool, ""Jackson Mississippi"" & ""Rock & Roll"" ROCKS! Even the slow songs are incredible with excellent pull-at-the-heart-strings lyrics. And the best thing about this album is that, aside from ""I Am"", is that he doesn't spend the whole damn thing talking about himself!It an excellent CD! Haven't removed it from the CD player since I bought it."
5,Kid Rock still rocks,"This is Kid Rock's follow up to Cocky and it's great. There's lots of variety in his musical talent, and it is very apparent on this album. I would recommend this to anyone who likes rock'n'roll, country or hip hop."
5,great cd,"I've always been a fan of Kid Rock on the radio but never purchased a cd of his until now. I bought this cd because the song ""Feel Like Making Love"" was stuck in my head and I wanted to hear it again and boy am I glad I got the cd.I have more respect for him as an artist now than I did before. I always assumed he was all hardcore metal... but this guy is versatile, he has substance, he can write his own music, AND he can play different genres of music.Kid Rock cannot be stereotyped. This cd shows his true talent... and I was so impressed I went shopping for his cocky album too (which is a great addition!)"
1,Kid Rock is a POSER,"Ok, I'm sorry, but it is IMPOSSIBLE to be what he is and still write good music. He tries to be rock, rap, and country!! You can be rock and rap, look as Rage Against the Machine! But you can't be rock and country!!! Billy Ray Cyrus tried to do that and...well, need I say more?! He's such a poser! He has songs like Cocky, which by the way SUCKED, which was rap rock...but then he goes and does a song with Hank Williams Jr and he ruined everything!! And by the way, the one rock magazine only gave him a 2.5 out of 5 stars...doesn't that say something?! Yeah...I know I'm right..."
1,Steaming pile of ...,"I am a loyal Kid Rock fan, and have been since his debut, but on the other hand, I am a loyal music fan, and feel it is my duty to put up a red flag up on this cd.We all know Kid says he's from every genre of music, and is not just a Detroit City rapper.Well, if he truly is the son of all genres, I think it's time that Blues/Country disowned him. This cd is truly horrible. Kid is not a singer, and never has been, so to put out almost a whole cd of him trying to sing is disgraceful. I'm not saying the guy doesn't have talent, don't get me wrong. He's a great lyricist, and song writer. He just needs to continue doing what he's good at, and stop trying to be something he's not, a country singer.To sum up, don't buy this cd if you like Kid Rock. AND if you like Kid Rock and DO buy this cd, please don't kiss his ... and say it's good. Be honest with yourself, and let him know not to do this again."
1,yep,"i must agree with this jano bjourn guy. I have seen that spilt side anna band a couple times in athens, georgia where the likes of r.e.m, widespread panic, and other bands have gotten their start. They mix new aged blues with slashing guitar riffs and cannalbilizing vocals. A brilliant mix between the rolling stones and creedance clearwater revival, if you are in to that kind of stuff. But if you're not, i insist you come to athens and check these guys out for christ's sake. From a quote on their website, www.splitsideanna.com, ""They are not trying to save rock 'n' roll, they are trying to save lives."" Enough said."
1,Kid Rock Oxymoron ( -10 stars),"It's obvious Mr. Ritchie is scraping the bottom of the barrel now. Ran out of material and trying to make good with other's talent. Pam must have really messed up his head. How that Billboard doin?This should appeal to 13 year old boys with package inferiority problems. As for Bob, shilling for GW Bush, rubbing shouldlers with the likes of Dennis Hastert and Bill Frist seems to be in vogue now. Mr Ritchie, I know Detroit, I know Rock, and you are not Detroit, nor Rock. Maybe still a kid. Good luck with the Hank Hill crowd. They buy anything."
1,.a,A kid with a rock upside his head is probably where he got the name kid rock.. id like to through a rock against his head this guy just sucks period.
3,its ok,"just got the cd, was a real fan of devil but the last one and this one just didnt do it for me and to the dumbass who said ""i have all 3 of the other cds"" hes got a lot more than that.."
2,Boo Hoo,"Man, what happaned to the slap the hoes early mornin stoned pimp?Every song on the damn album is like a break up song. He must be goin through a break up or something cause it sounds like it in this album. God..... why doesnt he just make like justin timberlake and cry me a f****** river."
1,BIGTIME LETDOWN,"Man, this KR cd is the worst. Is he trying to get in touch with his feminine side or what? What a waste of money. This CD is way too touchy-feely with way too little grit. I'm afraid KR has resigned himself to a future of ballad singing with Ms. Crow and the likes. Come back to us Kid!"
2,Not working for me,"There are 2 breeds of Kid Rock fans.The Devil without a Cause and everything before it kindThe Cocky and everything after that.I'm more of a Devil, Polyfuze, EMSP guy.It's not that this CD is even country, it's more like Rock a Billy. I don't like the seriousness that the songs have. I dont really care for the cover. I'm not sure where Rock goes after this.I think after he ""made it"" with Devil, he really didnt care what the fans thought of his stuff. He's basically just experimenting with his own personal taste, which there is nothing wrong with that. I wonder what happened to the American Bad Ass though?O well there's always next album"
3,Love some of it.,I like some of this cd and wish that Kid Rock would sell his music by the song sometimes. I don't alway care for some of his rap music.
5,"Shut up AJ, yea i'm talkin' ta you","this aj guy is just trippin' u guys, cause in my opinion if i made a list of my fav. cd's i've ever bought it would be close to the top of my list, how can you say it's bad, this is the best cd he's ever made, an i mean that, an this A MUSIC FAN from texas, you must have not listened to the whole cd because ""I AM"" basicly describes YOU!!!!!! how can you critsize him for playing rap rock and country, that's like tellin' linkin park to choose rock or rap, or tellin' lynard skynard to choose country or rock, you just can't do that, it's his style and when this type of music becomes popular, just like the rap metal thing, i'm gonna laugh in both of your faces, so go back to 'n' sync and coldplay."
5,Not Rock-Not Country- ALL KID and his CREW!!!,"What a great CD! I think this one will be around for a long time!(track 5 ,Jackson, Mississippi), is the best song I've heard in years!If you""re looking for true talent and don't mind seeing all sides of the Rock, buy it, play it, and smile! I do, every time it slides in the player!! Kid Rock has style!!This CD impresses this 40 year old fab female just fine, like all his others!!!"
1,Kid Country doesnt Rock.,"I have been a fan of Kid Rock's since his album ""Grit Sandwiches for Breakfast"" and have all 8 of his previous albums. I have seen him in concert 3 times, and now this. Kid you no longer Rock, you have almost totally turned your back on all your ""old school"" fans. I bought this album thinking I would hear at least one ""Bawitaba"" or ""Cowboy"" calibur song and all I got stuck with was a bunch of Lame country sounding songs about how he's the best thing to ever come to music. Sorry man, all 9 of my Kid Rock fan friends agree...you sold out. If you are a fan of the old Rap/Rock Kid Rock, steer clear of this Cd."
3,good honky tonk music,this is a great country cd if you like country get this cd you would be unsatisified.
1,Hard to follow,"Kid Rock's 3rd CD Cocky was by far my favorite so I knew when buying his 4th, he had a lot to live up to. SO when I'm scrolling through the tracks, I was all the way through and still didn't hear anything worth listening to again, except for maybe his remake of Bad Company. He needs to decide, country or rock? Wonder what's next, jazz?"
1,its Terrible,"This is more redneck shlock from a man who has lost his mojo. Save your money, its not even worth downloading. Dude, get back on what ever made you write the Devil album, because its going to go down in history as your only decent CD. Now I have to take this coaster to a used cd store and try to salvage 2 bucks from it."
1,What was he thinking???!!!!!????,"I was totaly psyched to see Kid Rock's new album had arrived in stores.....I grabbed it, and bought it without hesitation....I stuck it in my CD player....the first song wasn't that bad, let's try the next one....the feel like makin' love remake was pretty good too.....but the rest of the album was pretty much a disapointment. I mean, I was looking for that hard rockin', American Bad Ass attitude which Kid Rock is so famed for! Where was it? All I heard was a bunch of whiney, blues-like, country songs (minus the one rap collaboration) on this album.I don't think that this should be a self titled album.....I think it should be called ""Kid Rock - I Wussed Out!"" And after listening to the CD once.....I really want my money back!Sorry Kid....I don't mean to make you cry....as long as you like it....that's all that matters.....just keep telling yourself that."
3,Different kid rock,"Hi,I'm a big Kid Rock fan and i just bought Kid Rock's new cd. It's a soft album and very bluesy. This is not a hard rock album at all! Did Sheryl Crow go to his head?!Anyway, it's still good. Just not the best."
5,For the Haters,"I recently saw the kid in concert and let me tell you. If you haven't seen him in concert. Do it i don't care how far you have to drive. You will have more respect for him as an artist and entertainer than you did before. As for his new cd it is easily one of the top five albums I've ever listen to. It ranks right up there with Bat out of Hell ML. His new stuff is what rock n'roll needs. Its fresh and revived with the Rocks traits though. The rap/rock that he used to do is great and i wished he still do a little more, but as he matured he likes to sing those songs for his live shows and let me tell you, those songs are something else live, unbelievable He even said he likes to do those songs live more than his newer country stuff. But on his newer cd's he likes the stuff he is doing now. I just hope he does a few rap/rock song on his future cd's to keep his concert energized and the roof blowing off. But the new stuff is the awesome and Kid keep continuing being the American Bad A@#."
3,The true Kid Rock shines through!,"Now that Kid Rock has gained enough fame and money to become ""Big Time Bobby"" he doesn't have to pretend to be a Vanilla Ice white boy rapper from the hood. Sure that stuff worked before he was famous. And we all go through our phases, whether goth, punk, or like Rock, gansta. I'm glad that he is doing country rock. That is what he is best at, the new album is great and I look forward to seeing him do a full cover album of the mullet southern rock hits of the 80s and some Hank Jr. covers. The rap persona was just a put on back in the day to keep him from getting beat up in the city hoods when he got kicked out of his middle class home. The only hoods Kid Rock hangs around now a days are the hoods to his expensive cars/trucks. Great album, I recomend this to everyone. Except white boy rapper wanna bes. Yall wont like this one. Just go play your M&M cds."
4,Just buy it and shut up!,"Although I'm not sure if there is a blockbuster single on this album, it's still entertaining. This is an album, not a group of radio-friendly,3:30, throw-away singles. Just enjoy it!!"
1,BOOOOOOOO!,"Now i'm a huge Kid Rock fan, and i'm not one to immediately start accusing artists of selling out and I appreciate musical growth just as much as the next person, BUT THIS STUFF SUCKS!This album did absolutely nothing for me and I knew what it was going to be like going in...yah, some of the slow songs are good, but theirs like 5 of them. And every ""rock"" song contains a lameazz country guitar riff that I hear in every other country rock song. The only song I really gave an ish about is Jackson, Mississippi.People want to say he's ""moved on"" and ""rap rock"" is dead...if you though Kid Rock was rap rock in the first place your stupid. He incorporated all different types of music into fresh, intelligent, edgy music that you could mosh, chill out too, basically play in any type of place around any type of people.This is a plain and simple lame country album. Go back to your roots dawg..."
4,Is this Kid Rock???,"Wow this is a great new feel for the Kid. As I sit here listening to the new CD, I can't beleive what I am hearing. This CD is what Kid Rock should sound, great bluesy, dirty rock with a good mixed sound. Warning it is NOT the hip hop rap type style you might expect. THUMBS UP"
3,Lynard Skynard Returns,"Kid Rock was supposed to be the ""American Badass"", but now he's mellow. I do like the disk, but the music has changed dramatically from the prior releases. Kid has now come full circle by now representing artists like Bad Company and sort of an Otis Redding type groove. Just sit back and relax and this album will be fine."
1,Kid Schlock,"I know that Kid Rock likes KISS, and this is evidence: He's created his own version of ""Music From The Elder.""OK, ""Picture"" was good song, but did you have to abandon everything in favor radio play? You were getting that when you carved out a niche for what you do best, which isn't this. This is the worst George Strait album ever made. If it was free it would be a ripoff. Pat Boone's ""In A Metal Mood"" is the only album that compares to this that I can think of. I'm still waiting for ""50 Cent Does The Best of Show Tunes."" Maybe they can be a 2-for-1 deal when it comes out.American Lame Ass! - Next?!?!?!"
2,Kid Rock Doesn't,"This album feels like a warm up for the highly superior Rock and Roll Jesus. The fact is after listenting to Rock and Roll Jesus for awhile, I decided to get this record. Unfortunately, it is so non-descript that I had forgotten I already owned this record. This recording is for die-hard fans only."
2,A change for the worse,"I was very disappointed by Kid Rock's newist CD. It lacks the edge, hip hop and humor of his other albums. Since when did Kid Rock try to become the next Lyndrd Skynrd. It is not an awful CD, but many of the songs do not even sound like Kid Rock. They sound like a county western singer impersonating Kid Rock"
5,incredible ! amazing! best album ever!,"If you do not think this is the best Kid Rock album of all time, have your head examined for faulty wiring! A most eclectic mix of many genres, yet uniquely his own, truly a stand out in the badass motherf***er category. Do yourself a favor and buy this album now. Be one of the first on board to say, "" Where the hell have you been? I knew all the words before this song even hit the airwaves!!!"" A triumph for my favorite Bobby! Sincerely, 2L ......... all my love from Alabama!"
1,too bad,"Wish this would have been stocked under the ""country"" section. WHERE DID KID ""ROCK"" GO? Who is this Kid ""Country"" using his name?The only song I find even remotely appealing was ""Feel Like Makin' Love"".If you do not like country music I beg of you..... Do not buy this CD!"
2,Going solo was not the best for Junior,"This album is Junior Gonzalez first album as a solo artist after 5 years with Larry Harlow. Can't say the change was all good for him. I really think that Junior and Larry were made for each other (musically) and that they should of never split (even though Junior returns a couple of years later.)""Comedia"" is good as well as ""Violencia"" which has a meaningful message. In ""Cadenas"" there's a special appearance by Luis ""Perico"" Ortiz who gives a sensual trumpet solo. I have somewhat of a deal with the song's lyrics because it speaks about a person as property, although metaphoric (I believe), still a tad bit uncomfortable.Even though the album is not terrible, is it not good either. No song on this album made me jump for joy like I did with ""Salsa"" or ""Hommy: A Latin Opera."" Don't pay more than the suggested retail price for this one, specially because this one is very rare and people are going to try to sell it expensive."
1,Where is Scrappy?,I agree...why do they keep releasing duplicate episodes? I really want them to release all the original Scrappy episodes as well as the ones with Scooby Dumb and Scooby Dee etc.
4,Ok for the price,"I got this for my Baking class for culinary school. It's good not having to use the old-fashioned balance scale but it has ups and downs. Good things are that it's lightweight, moderately priced, and comes with a bowl. I wouldn't recommend this for heavy duty bakers or for someone who will use it every day--the surface is too small to put other containers/measuring apprati but then I haven't seen an electric scale with a wide surface except for the commercial ones you see in supermarkets. Oh, I almost forgot--I use it to weigh my pet hamsters and rat--another good use besides for baking."
5,I couldn't be happier with my food scale!,"This food scale is perfect for me. It takes up very little space on the counter and looks nice enough that I leave it sitting out for daily use.I love that it came with it's own bowl that sits on it. The bowl is the perfect size for measuring liquid or foods that might otherwise 'run away', but is easily removable for larger items that need to sit directly on the scale.It is very user friendly. I would highly recommend it."
3,"Well written, for Teenagers!","This is a well-written book about high school witchcraft but should be advertised for teenagers. Some of the dialog, action and reactions are juvenile, some of the situations were overly predictable, and the ending leaves one of the situations unfinished. There should have been one more chapter to bring it all together. Suggest the target audience should be teenage girls."
3,Witches galore,"Witches, shamans, and wiccans, all encountered and explained in great detail. A suspenseful story of a high-school student trying to steer her way through it all."
5,Double booking,"I love all Julian May her books, and was not aware that this Vol 2 was also published in her book Intervention, which I read 2x. For me the story is both fiction but could very well become fact."
2,What Intervention...,"I read Part 1 which laid the background for the Intervention, so I eagerly read Part 2, but was very disappointed to find that the actual Intervention was only one line at the end of the book, basically saying ""the space ships have come"". I want to know how humans react to the coming of the aliens, but sadly we will not find out. At least the next book, ""St. Jack the Bodiless"", covers some events after the Invention when Earth was still under Simbari Proctorship."
3,Okay Book for the Price,"The book itself(physically) is small and affordable. The material in the book goes over many of the basics while skipping study tips which is usually what I expect from Cliff Notes, otherwise the book did what it was supposed to do but got very boring at times."
3,Magnets not strong enough,"I got this for a long car trip with my preschooler. I really want to like it - the concept is great, and the product is really cute. My kid thinks it's neat. But the magnets barely stick to the board, and fall off when you tilt the board at any significant angle, or, heaven forbid pick the board up by the handle (one would assume that you are supposed to hold it by the handle, considering they designed it with one). So we ended up with 23 little magnets under the seats and all over the place. If you are willing to keep the magnets separate in a ziploc bag and watch closely to make sure all the pieces don't get lost, then this is a decent toy. With my four year old, it was just a pain."
4,A pleasant mixture of culture and history,"This book was much more pleasant to read in many ways than most history books. It blends history with various cultural aspects such as sausage making and other traditional pasttimes and holidays. As a result, it does quite a bit to soften the sometimes drier moments of history. It is one of the few history books I have read that make me feel I would know something useful about a place if I were to travel there. Also, because the historical aspect is why I bought the book, I was not to be disappointed, the Cod Wars, the Settlement, Christianization, it is all there along with an especially interesting section on the first settlement of Greenland. I recommend this book."
5,A wonderful read,I greatly enjoyed this book. It was fun to read and very interesting from a historical point of view. I'm going to Iceland soon and I feel that I understand the background and culture of the country better than before I read this book.I highly recommend it !
4,Informative,"Interesting read. Allows you to understand what who and where about Iceland.Very informative. It read kind of like a text book and not a travelogue which is what I was looking for. Despite the format, I still enjoyed the book."
3,Not the best.,"If you are looking for a well-organized history of Iceland, you probably don't want this one. I get the feeling that the author wants it both ways: to be folksy AND legitimate. It doesn't fly. . . I have read several books on Iceland and this is my least favorite. ..."
4,Good EDC folder,"I have had one of these little knifes for at least a year now, and I never leave home without it. And just recently I bought another to give as a gift for my brother. Very sharp (and sharp-looking), I only occasionally need to touch up the edge."
3,Spurr's Guide,"Really didn't go into what features, good or bad, to look for in the cruising sailboat. Danced lightly around the subject and didn't go deeply into anything."
3,Good but confusing,"Unfortunately it is a good book but if you want to find something specific it is nearly impossible. Chapters are put in order in a strange way so that information for the same matter is ""scattered"" all over the book."
3,average product,"nice product, fits well, it's only grey colour and you'll need painting if your interior has black handles.Switchbox for windows & mirrors doesn't fit perfectly in."
2,Any other inaccuracies hiding in here?,"I bought this manual so that I'd have a guide when I went to replace my fork seals. It turns out that, on page 356, there's an error in the instructions for reassembling the forks. The oil stopper should go between the inner and outer tubes, not the inner tube and the cartridge. I didn't know this at the time and so, after 5 hours of work, gave up and brought the fork tubes into a service shop. In the future, I'll make sure to take my own notes and perhaps even some pictures while working on my bike."
3,medieval muslim horsemanship: a fourteenth-century Arabic ca,"While the illuminations of this text are nice, there is not much description of the actual text. Smith spends much of the little text interpreting the pictures, which is helpful, but there is no translation of the text. More like a picture book."
1,poor audio quality,don't waste your time on this cd. the recording was taken mostly from old radio shows she performed in. including the annoying applause at the end of the song. audio quality is poor of course. they did their best in some third world country to perfect the sound but failed.
4,industrial soundscapes,"The album's good, a mix of early Coil work, but hard to listen to in one sitting since the album as a compilation has no continuity. Though great stuff, I'd recommend buying a real album such as one of the Musics to Play in the Dark or Horse Rotorvator (which has a similar sound to this stuff).My main reason for writing this review, however, is to make clear than Unnatural History IS NOT Horse Rotorvator with different song titles. I don't know where the previous reviewer heard this, but it's not true."
4,Not just for the Mac Mini,"I'm using mine with my PowerMac G5, where it fits perfectly on the top, right under the carrying handle, to bring a ton of ports to the front of the machine. I have no use for the short, tiny patch cables in this installation, but they make a great addition to my Road Warrior kit!Incidentally, complaints about power limitations on this hub are misplaced. The hub draws power from the Firewire port if its connected, which has much more power than a USB port.The only down side is that it only has two firewire ports."
1,Couldn't use it with my new Mac Mini at all...,"This item unfortunately doesn't say that it won't work too well with the latest Dual Core Mac Mini, due to the new Mini design which moves the rear USB and Firwire ports to the other side, making it nearly impossible for the tiny connectors to reach. I finally got it connected but the resulting tangle of cords made it nearly impossible to add additional cables, and kept turning the Mini slightly so it sat kind of off-kilter on the hub and looked pretty silly. I also had no use for the front Firewire port, since none all my small peripherals (Palm, iPod, camera etc.) use USB so I had to have a bulky scanner wire connected to the front of the hub, draping around both it and the Mini. What a mess! I would make sure you check the back of your Mini before purchasing, to see that the locations of the connectors line up."
4,"So far, so good...","I am using this with a Mac Mini with the Intel Core Duo. The only issue I've encountered is that the provided firewire cable (to connect the computer to the hub) is too short. The cable is about 2-3 inches, and needs about an extra inch to reach between the ports. I have yet to find a replacement cable that is shorter than six feet.In addition, be careful when plugging it into the computer. When I plugged in the USB cable (from computer to hub), it shorted out my monitor (which was quickly fixed by restarting the computer). I'd suggest turning off the computer before connecting.I also agree that it would be nice to have more of the ports located on the front or sides because sitting under the Mini means that you have to dig through cables going into that to access the ports."
1,What they don't make clear,"Nice aesthetic design and all that, but what's not at all clear upfront is that this Belkin hub only supports up to Firewire 400. Who uses that any more if they don't have to? And know that if you're using this for anything but a MacMini you'll have to purchase new cables (Firewire 6-pin (400) and USB) because the cables provided with the hub are so short as to not reach anything except a MacMini sitting directly on top of the hub. The new cables will end up costing you more than what you just paid for the hub. So the problem is not with the information provided BEFORE the sale, but with the information NOT provided."
5,Dedicated Hub for the Mac-Mini,"Arrived promptly, easy to install and works fine. So far, I am pleased. No such thing as too many ports!"
4,It hasn't failed me yet,"I was worried after reading some of the other reviews, but I took a leap and am pleased so far. It is almost perfect for the Macmini except it would be nice if it had a lip so the computer wouldn't slide around on it. When I plug something in to the ports on the front of the hub I have to hold the top of the computer to prevent the whole thing from moving because it is light weight. Sometimes the computer slides a little on the hub when I do this. It only takes a second to realign it. The only operational error I have encountered is when plugging my thumb drive in the front port it sometimes does not read it and so I have to plug it in the back. Other devices work fine when I plug them in there so it might be operator error when I unplugged it once."
5,Perfect for a Mac Mini setup,"Belkin USB 2.0& Firewire 6-Port Hub For Mac MiniThis hub is just perfect -- form factor is the same as the Mini and the Airport Extreme base station, a whole bunch of cables come out the back and are hidden away out of sight, neat and tidy installation. Highly recommended!"
4,Good unpowered hub,Fits well under the Mac mini. Only problem are power hungry devices - they need to be hooked up to the Mac mini since there is no option to externally power this hub.
2,"For the Mac Mini, you're kidding","I bought this specifically because I wanted it for my Mac Mini and it is advertised for a Mac Mini. My Mac Mini has a Firewire 800. This has a Firewire 400. If you have an old Mac Mini, go for it. A newer Mac Mini, keep looking! One more thing, Belkin support isn't."
2,Not for the mid-2011 Mac Mini,"The Mac Mini (mid-2011) has four USB 2.0 ports and a Firewire 800 port on the back. I have two firewire 800 devices, an external hard drive and a Seagate GoFlex portable drive. I ordered this because it would expand my USB and Firewire ports PLUS give me one of each in the front. However, when I received it I was very disappointed. The Firewire ports are for the slower 400Mbps devices, not the faster 800Mbps. I could get an adapter, but it would basically cause the devices to slow to half the speed of which they are capable. I returned it and am continuing to look for a similar device for the faster devices. Currently, when I need to update the portable drive I plug it into the port in the hard drive. I thought about keeping this unit just for the expanded USB ports, but the cost was pretty high for that."
4,EXCELLENT PRODUCT BUT.....,"Well designed, does it's job well BUT if your USB or Firewire 400 attachment needs extra juice, it will not work as it does not have a plug-in feature."
2,stops working,"I have been having this problem ever since I got it: the USB-connected devices (keyboard, webcam) stop functioning. The firewire ones (iPod and external HD) keep receiving power and working correctly. I have looked for solutions but have found none. I am using a G4 Powerbook."
3,"Nice looking, but limited--no power adapter","This hub looks nice and matches the mini-mac, but it is not equipped for a power adapter. This means that only self-powered USB accessories will work with it, and any accessory that draw its power from the USB port probably won't. My printer and scanner worked, but I was unable to use my USB powered portable hard drive. Since this hub uses the only remaining free USB port on the mini-mac, this was unacceptable for me."
3,"Nice, but draws power when computer is off","This appeared to be what I was looking for, and looked nice on my Mac mini. While it would accomplish my goal to neaten up the cabling around my Mini, I was surprised to see that it keeps drawing power while the computer is off. I shut off my computer when it's not in use, and don't want devices continuing to waste power. so I ended up returning this. It might be an issue for some folks, so if you don't mind the wasted energy, this isn't a bad product."
4,A few flaws...,"It looks nice and it integrates well with my iMac. So far data rates are decent and I was able to use every port and not run into any problems. But this product is not without flaws. The cables that come with it are really short, granted it was designed for a Mac mini but it's nearly impossible to use with anything else. Also, in my case the USB cable that came with it was defective. Looking back on my purchase, I probably would have gone with a better product but I can't say that I'm not happy with it."
3,"Not bad, but a little disappointed","I'm using this hub with the new Apple Airport Extreme rather than the Mac Mini, for which it was designed. So I'm not using the Firewire ports, but if I were, I'd want at least one more port. The port on teh front is nice, but that only leaves one open port on the back, which is a net gain of zero ports after you connect this ""hub"" to the Mac Mini Firewire port.But the biggest disappointment is that this is an unpowered hub! That's fine if all you plug into it are self-powered devices, but that leaves out flash drives and bus-powered portable hard drives. Belkin should at least have offered an optional power supply for those who want one."
2,"Meh, kind of disappointed.","So out of the box the unit looks nice and is as described. Upon connecting it to my brand new iMac, I quickly learn that I can't see my two external drives connected via Firewire. After some troubleshooting, I decipher that the Firewire port in the back is bad. I can use the one in the front, but suffice to say I'm a little disappointed. Not worth the hassle to ship back to Amazon for a return. Honestly, I wouldn't buy it again. I expect more from Belkin, but they must have just thrown this together to serve a niche market."
2,Squeals when you connect the firewire cable,"I'm sure this product was a nice idea when it was made, but today it's just not that good, and it appears that Belkin has no interest in fixing the problems.First, as others have pointed out, it draws power from the Firewire port. Unfortunately, this appears to be a bad idea because it (or my Mac -- it's hard to tell) squeals when I connect it to the Firewire port. This might be because my Mac Mini has a Firewire 800 port, and I need to use a 400/800 converter to connect it, and the power drain is probably too much.I'm returning mine to Amazon."
2,"Looks good, but not a good value","This hub is an expensive hub that fits well and looks good, but because it has no power, it isn't very useful. You need power for USB devices, in particular, or many of them won't work. It's OK for a printer or Flash memory stick, but not so good for a keyboard, mouse, iPod, camera, or many of the other devices that power up via USB ports, when plugged in.Worse, the one I bought only lasted 2 years before it failed or burned out!?There are better products and a POWERED USB HUB is worth the extra money. This is my 3rd Belkin USB hub and I have not had much better luck with the other two. They make nice cables, but got cheap on the USB hub design."
3,A 6-port USB & Firewire Hub for your Mac,"I really like this hub, its slim, and goes perfect with ur Mac Mini.It's worth it!"
4,compact book to keep.,"this leather padfolio is small and compact.It's good to pay your bills ,and deal with your personal budgeding, and to use for important meetings,and it is not bulky,unless you put a lot of paper in it.Overall this item is very good to use.kG"
2,I thought this book was not so good,I rate Carnival Animals two stars for fun illustrations and two pages of laughter. Thirty five percent of the poems that flow through the book are energizing. This book is like a taco: the good layer is the meat and cheese or illustrations; the bad layer is the lettuce and tomato or the rest of the poems.Reviewed by Ben
4,"Carnival of the Animals, A great package!","This book is a great representation of carnival of the animals. The artwork I feel brings out the character of the animals in a way that matches the music. It seems to fit in well with a kids imagination. I like the orchestral peices too. Each version i have heard of Carnival of the animals is a little different, none the less, I quite enjoyed this one. It is certainly an all time classic for any storybook library."
5,Saved over $400.,"Compared to how much it would have cost at the dealer parts counter, I saved over $400 purchasing from Amazon. Quality was excellent. Works great! Saved money by installing myself too. Thanks Amazon!"
1,Warning Beware!,"Just received this today. the length is only 56"" and not 72"" as advertised! Am sending it back. My first shoddy experience using Amazon."
4,"Don't give up on it, its a winner","This book has a slow start. I almost quit reading it a third of the way through, but I'm really glad I kept going. It just keeps getting better and better up to an hysterically funny climax."
5,yummy taste,I think this is the best tasting chewable vitamin that I have ever tasted.This product is also a great brand.This isnt your everyday cheap run of the mill vitamin c that you get aT WALMART.Only at your fine natural stores.Excellent product.
4,Great TV for the money....,"Did the research; did the homework; compared and contrasted many different types of TV's - looking in the $1,000 - $1,500 dollar price range. I ordered this TV and set it up and plugged everything in and only took about 20 minutes. Set-up instructions were clear, easy and couldn't be happier."
4,Sound got cut off,"After reading several of the reviews from other people, I know that I am not the only person whose TV sound got cut off. At first I thought it was my Comcast cable box's problem but later found out it was the TV. This has happened to me about 3 to 4 times for the past two weeks. Going to call Samsung to figure out who is wrong with it.Other than that, this TV looks amazing. The picture quality is superb, specially when watching Discovery or other HD channels.The design is cyber-looking but the glossy outshell is easy to show dust.After all I am happy with it."
5,Impressed,"I was concerned at first about the claims that all the manufacturers were making about their LCD TVs, but after a little research I can say I am impressed & I would recommend Samsung LCD TVs. The price was right."
5,LNT4053H,"Great TV, fantastic color and calibration options. Great for gaming and TV watching. Recommend an upconverting DVD player if not going blue ray. Best TV for the money $999 w/S&H."
5,pretty amazing!!!!!!!,pretty nice tv.......no problems so far.....but needs tweeking in order to get the best picture. other than that excellent tv......
5,samsung LNT4053H,"Just received my Samsung LNT4053H from Amazon. Shipping was great and I received the TV before expected. Set up was a snap. Just follow the on screen menu. I set my viewing preference and I was in business. The TV is great, picture is better than expected and it looks impressive. I have only had it for a week now but so far I am pleased. Amazon made ordering easy and they kept me informed the minute I placed the order.Samsung LNT4053H 40"" LCD HDTV"
1,Buy a different model,"Within a year of buying this TV, it started to have problems turning on. I would click for 4 - 6 minutes and then it might turn on with no sound at all or at full volume (which wakes up everyone in the house). Sometimes when turned on all you see is a stripe pattern or a ""tye-dyed"" effect. Lines of pink squares also appear. The TV has to be turned on and off several times before it corrects itself and is watchable at all. It has been highly annoying.We paid quite a bit for this TV and bought it as an anniversary present to each other when my husband got back from serving in Afghanistan and it has been nothing but a headache. Do yourself a favor and buy a different brand/model."
1,Do not trust the white glove delivery,"I ordered this tv, and did not realize I would be getting a terrible experience with delivery. Amazon uses a third party to set it up in your house. After I found this out, I thought it might not be too bad, but they never delivered the product. I got a call more than a week after ordering informing me I would be contacted soon to arrange a delivery. Well they never called back, and after nearly 2 weeks I got fed up. It was 4 days after the delivery estimate and 3 weeks after I ordered. I had to call and cancel the order. Now I will not get credit for the the visa payment I already made until this delivery agency returns the TV to Amazon. Meanwhile I can not buy another tv with regular delivery until I get my refund.Buyer Beware, do not use amazon's white glove service, it is not worth the risk."
3,Good TV on a bad stand,"We enjoy our TV but the stand that it came on doesn't fully support the weith of the TV. The TV leaned severely forward when we got it. We took the stand off and put it back on, tightening the screws as much as possible and it helped, but it still leans."
1,really disapointed,"First day, picture went out, service had to replace the entire screen!Samsung LNT4053H 40"" LCD HDTV"
2,Worst Experience EVER!!!,"I ordered this TV and the first one they sent the picture looked terrible. They picked it up, sent another, and about 2 weeks later the audio stopped working. That was in January. After 6 phone calls and much time on the phone with Amazon the TV is still sitting in my apartment. FOUR MONTHS LATER. The customer service has been terrible and they can't seem to make the appropriate arrangements to come get this thing. If that hasn't been bad enough, their customer service rep gave me an attitude over the fact that I am annoyed about it. I will never order from Amazon again. I'd rather pay more and know that what I'm getting is going to work. This was a complete waste of time and effort."
3,Dissapointed,"I purchased mine one month ago. The first 3 and half weeks were awesome. I was astounded at the quality of the picture just using digital cable. The sound is excellent. But, I have already had a repair person here to check it out, terrible picture even using a Sony upconvert DVD player. The repair person said nothings wrong. Well, going from in AWE to terrible picture, something is wrong. I researched for 6 or more months before deciding on this. I will give it another week or so, going to call Samsung. Another new thing that is happening is the sound cuts out every so often. Just might be returning this one. Very disapointed, I gave this a 5 star at another website at first."
3,"Samsung HDTV and ""The Krays"" DVD","My Samsung HDTV takes at least 3-4 minutes to come on once on button is activated, with a sharp click 30 sec. before I get a picture. This is very aggravating. Any suggestions?The ""Krays"" dvd can only be playerd on my computer. Why wasn't I informed of this before I purchased it?"
1,quality of samsung is lacking,"i bought this TV from amazon in november of 2007 and paid over 1200 dollars for it. i thought it was a good deal at the time. now almost 5 years later, my TV takes a long time time to turn on, constantly clicking. what i have read online is that this is not uncommon for samsung TV's made during this time. the cause is bad capacitors and the it will cost me around 200 dollars to fix. when this TV finally bites the dust, I will not be looking at samsung. they have lost a customer for life."
1,Capacitator Problems with Sets After 1-2 Years,"Do not buy Samsung TVs. After a year or two (after the warranty expires), I (and many other people -- review online blogs) have had the capacitaor fail on the tv. The result is a clicking noise when you try to power on, as the tv continually tries to recycle. It takes 5 minutes, sometimes more, for the tv to start, and it constantly clicks. Samsung is well aware of the problem and is refusing to fix it, despite numerous complaints from many people. The customer service is just awful. If you buy this or other Samsung tvs, beware, because your tv will last only as long as the warranty and then you are on your own."
1,Multiple Technical Problems,"Like most people I had one major problem with this unit right away which was the sound cutting out regularly. Samsung tech support did do a good job remedying the problem by express mailing a thumb drive with a firmware update that fixed the sound issue immediately. After that I didn't have any problems for quite some time until about 2 1/2 years after purchase the set started having serious difficulties starting up. After being turned off for a long time, turning the set on took about 3-5 minutes during which clicking noises would occur. Once the set finally turned on, often there was no sound and even sometimes no picture. Samsung has no firmware update to fix this and recommended that I be referred to a service center who said it could cost from $150-300 to fix with several days of waiting.The TV in the end, seemed like a good purchase but after all of the problems I've encountered I couldn't consider buying another Samsung TV."
5,great product,I just got it and the picture and sound quality is great. I'm very happy with tis aquisition and recommend the product.
4,"Samsung LNT4053H 40"" LCD HDTV .","Samsung LNT4053H 40"" LCD HDTVI am as happy as a pig in a mudhole. I am using a 25 year old antenna and getting several channels in HD. Even the analog channels are much better than my old set which was about as old as the antenna. The set is not perfect and it might be the antenna but several times I have seen the picture break up momentary around a fast moving object a few times a couple weeks ago but not lately. I am very satisified with the picture quality."
4,"samsung LNT4053h 40""","first! id like to thank to amazon for deliviring my order samsung 40"", scratch less and in perfect condition. they deliver the tv a week early than the date they supposed to deliver, which is i suprised and im happy for that.the tv was exccelent, pictures was really good, sound is great! im still trying to know better with this tv like the setting which is i am really confused, cause a lot of option! and 1 more thing, to someone who reading this, it might be you can give me an idea, cause im trying to use this tv as a monitor of my laptop but the tv says ""not supported mode"". i didnt call samsung customer service yet, cause im still trying to know this tv. anyway, good luck for all the customer of amazon, just think of it, no tax no shipping rate the price is the best, you just stay home and relax! what im gonna say to amazon is "" THE BEST!"""
4,"Beautiful TV, a few minor issues","This TV is great. Blacks are black, colors are accurate, images are sharp. With the built-in digital receiver you can get over-the-air HDTV channels that are simply beautiful. One complaint is sometimes if the image is mostly low-contrast with subtle tones of greys and darker colors, there is motion blur. This effect isn't noticeable for high-contrast images like sports. Great for football, especially with the ""Vivid"" image setting and the HDTV over-the-air feeds from national channels.I'm also using this TV as a computer monitor, using DVI-HDMI converter. Games look great. Not so good for web browsing because the max 1360x768 make it hard to see much, have to scroll down a lot. Kinda wish I had gone with a 1080p just for the extra resolution with the PC.On the speakers: sufficient for television, but a receiver + nice speakers are good idea if you want a good setup for movies."
3,The Sony Is Better,"I purchased this television over christmas and I was very dissapointed with this Samsung tv after reading all the great reviews. The picture leaves much to be desired. I experienced a significant amount of noise thorugh a variety of inputs including component and hdmi connections. Edge definition was sharp but was plauged by digital interference. I calibrated the picture using the nice array of availiable settings but this did nothing to help the poor definition of the picture. Over the air hd lacked the definition of other sets I've viewed. The color and contrast was fairly good but clarity is not this television strong suit.Overall the picture is good but plagued by weak noise filtering resulting in a less than perfect picture, and if your going to pay for it, then it should be perfect, nothing less.I purchased a Sony Bravia 40"" 720p and though it has its own weaknesses I would recommend it over this set any day."
5,A Best Buy!,"$400 less than BestBuy delivered! Set up a snap and piture is just great. Thought that a Panasonic Plasma was the answer until I compared pictures. This is better than Sony. Wanted a super high def (1020) but couldn't really see the difference. Just wanted a great TV. With the built in surround system, I have moved my Bose system to the music room!"
5,The Only Early Childhood Programming Book You Need To Buy!,"I have taught five and six year olds for years. This year I'll be working with four year olds. I bought about a dozen books to help with my programming but this really is the only book I needed to buy. It's FANTASTIC! It tells you what to do for morning circle, story ideas, music and movement ideas, a range of learning centres that cater for the preferred learning styles of the children and then ideas for reflection in the closing circle. It does all this on hundreds of themes and then gives assessment ideas too. I LOVE THIS BOOK."
3,Theme selections were lacking,"This book was ok. It does have some good activities. However, in my preschool classroom I use a weekly or bi-weekly theme. The types of themes I have are intended to give my preschoolers some background knowledge by really immersing them in the theme. I have themes like community helpers, the ocean, dinosaurs, insects, etc. I really didn't get much of that from this book. Some of the themes aren't applicable such as ""Sing me a song"" (we do songs all year long), ""things that go together,"" and ""opposites."" All of these are more easily integrated into other thematic units than stand out in their own unit.There are some good activities in this book, and it may be useful in some ways. It was not what I needed however."
5,Most memorable book,I cannot understand why this book is not mentioned more often as one of the great books of the Twentieth Century.It is a stunning read full of images and ideas that remain in the mind long after the last page is read.It is haunting and also most illuminating.Morante succeeds magnificently in detailing the effects of war and (perhaps more importantly)the aftermath of war on the ordinary people of Rome.In her hands these people become extraordinary.I can recall reading passages in other books that have moved me similarly but never one that moved one so consistently and continuously as the story builds to its climax.At present I feel to read any other work of fiction would only detract from the experience I have had.
4,Pretty good stuff,"Tasty, not too sweet, great to snack on during a movie. The packing makes it hard to save for later, but it seems to keep well in the fridge even exposed to the air."
3,Missed Fortune 101,"Not as easy to read as ""Untapped Riches"", but informative and similar information. Mostly discusses keeping a mortgage, getting no interest mortgage if you can, and little money down so that the money you keep you can invest and grow. Funny, all these books use 8% return as the qualifying rate over 20 years which sounds nice, but returns on anything can be iffy."
1,Good thing I didn't believe it,"I wanted to give it 0 stars, but I guess that's not available. My mortgage broker gave me this book to read, after he convinced me to refinance after he failed to convince me to go with an interest-only mortgage. I am no expert, but I thought it was a bit too crazy for my taste. I was reorganizing my bookshelf and noticed it today, so I wondered what people might be saying about it here on Amazon after the mortgage bubble burst. Well, anyway, it's a bunch of bs. Glad I didn't pay for it."
5,Amazing Financial Concepts,"I have been in the financial services industry for 10+ years and I have been amazed at the dramatic impact that Mr. Andrew's financial strategies have had on my clients' ability to accumulate wealth.The financial strategies within the book go against conventional wisdom and what we have been taught, but once they are understood, you will realize that much of what we have been taught (financially) is benefitting someone besides ourselves.I would recommend to not only read this book, but also to purchase it for everyone that you truly care about, as these common sense financial concepts and strategies will change the lives of those who put these ideas to work."
1,The WORST financial book I have ever read,"Those who have written positive reviews for this book must be insurance salespeople. It advises AGAINST IRAs??? and AGAINST 401-Ks??? It advise people to carry large mortgages well into retirement??? It supports these preposterous strategies with illogical premises and conclusions. Two examples: first it ignores that the contribution in a 401-K are deducted from your W2 earnings thereby allowing you to invest money that would go to the IRS; second, it assumes throughout all its examples that ""tax-exempt"" investments and taxable investments pay the same interest rate. Check out Municipal bonds vs. Corporate bonds for the folly in this assumption. Save the money you would spend on this book and put it in your 401-K."
1,How To Lose Your Home & Retirement and Lose Your Home in the Process,"As someone who works in the financial industry, sells investments and insurance, guides clients to prudent investment strategies, I have to say the book is loaded with tripe and miss-information. Who but an idiot would mortgage their home, cash in their 401k and IRAs, suffer the taxes and penalties on early distributions so they can invest everything in an universal life policy.Yes, I read the book cover to cover; not once but twice. This is a very dangerous book. It went in the trash when I finished it.If you're looking for a prudent way to invest, I'd suggest ""The Intelligent Investor,"" by Benjamin Graham.""Missed Fortune 101"" is Douglas Andrew's contribution to the housing and credit crunch we're in today."
5,Losing your equity to reverse mortgages at age 65,"You may be reading all these reviews and wonder whether these principles are real or not, but I will tell you an even bigger missed fourtune. I prepare peoples tax returns for a living. And I see Mr. and Mrs. Smith who have paid off their house with all their hard earned dollars and at age 65 turn around and get a reverse morgage and only get half of the equity out of their house. They take out a reverse morgage because social security is all they have. To combat inflation and to still stay in their house they have no other choice. So if you read this book like I have and follow the principles of seperating your equity from your house and letting it grow you will not be like the Smiths and get a reverse mortgage and only get half of it back."
1,There is another viewpoint...,"Scott Burns of the Dallas Morning News has written two articles dissecting Mr. Andrew's ideas. In ""What's missing is reality"" and ""If you follow author's advice, you could lose a bundle"" he rationally analyzes Andrew's strategy and pretty much debunks it. I would urge readers to go online and read Mr. Burns's analysis."
5,This is a fantastic book!,"This is trully a fantastic book. Many folks get turned off by the book because they might be under the impression that it is a get rich quick type of book, but it really is not. Mr. Andrew provides rock solid ideas and reveals many money myths that most financial planners and the general public are just not aware of. If you trully want to understand how personal finances work and how they can be leveraged to achieve the highest potential returns along with the tax benefits to go with it, this book will educate you on that.I highly recommend this book to anyone that has been misguided by HR managers, and so-called financial experts that are so prevalent in the media and on the internet.Also Missed Fortune 101 is a simplified version of the original Missed Fortune book. More details and the mathematical proof of everything Mr. Andrews writes about is in that book. Enjoy and be prepared for a wealthy retirement!"
5,A must read for anyone looking to maximize wealth,"there is a saying...""different isn't always better but better is always different!"" That sums up the teachings of this book. Why is it that only 3 out of 100 people are millionaires? Do you think those 3 people do the same things with their money that the other 97 do? Of course not.Pick up this book and learn strategies designed to maximize your wealth. Learn to operate your finances like a bank. Be prepared to learn about strategies that none of your neighbors or coworkers are utilizing. And be prepared for them to tell you that you are crazy for implementing. Then ask them if they are a millionaire. When they say no, disregard everything they said to you. I happen to know a few very high net worth people. They implement a lot of what I read about in this book.I wish I read this information 20 years ago."
5,This will change the way you think about finances!,This book blew me away with the concepts and idea's. It has completely changed how I will approach my mortgage and other retirement savings in the future. The concepts at a high level make a lot of sense. Getting down to the details on how to put all of these concepts together becomes more difficult. I recommend this book to everyone. I really enjoyed it.
1,A foolish scheme,"Horrible, awful advice from an insurance pitch-man. He conducts these ""seminars"" around the country where insurance agents and mortgage brokers are invited, and they are encouraged to bring potential clients so that the missed fortune people can make money, insurance agents can generate giant commissions on worthless products, and mortgage brokers can write up re-fi loans.There is NO SUCH THING as ""investment-grade life insurance."" It's a made-up term. My sandwich I had had for lunch is ""investment grade."" What does that mean? Nothing. People who don't know any better are suckered into this scam by a huckster who is making money from this book and the seminars.Do NOT be fooled by this scam. Don't buy the book, and certainly don't buy the ""advice."" This author is clueless."
5,If you like this one...read the original!,"Great abridged version of Mr. Andrew's earlier work, ""Missed Fortune"". If you don't have the time, or interest in reading 500+ pages, but still desire the economic TRUTH, then pick up this book. It's refreshing to read someone who has it figured out, rather than the rubbish that the likes of Orman, Quinn, and Ramsay give us on a daily basis. This book, and the strategies it contains, however, are not for the faint of heart. If you espouse to have financial discipine, then pick up, read, and implement!"
2,"High hopes ,,,, shot to hell","I tried to salvage my HP printer to the iMac . It worked ,but very slow - plug & play - back to the printer setting - delete jobs .Lots of awkward silence ............. before the "" ink sprinkler starts "" . Buy a new printer ****** run over the old one with a truck .I print all my photos at the big box store , much cheaper . With printer profiles using CS4 photoshop / perfect colors / dry creek ."
3,Basically,"It's a good reader for children, particularly those who are between first and third grades. It also works well with special needs children."
1,Not happy with this,"this little bottle is 15% alcohol. Making sure the flavor is absolutely disgusting. Do not recommend, and Will not purchase again."
2,Impossible to Read Scale!,"This scale is attractive enough and the bowl has held up well in the dishwasher. However, while the numbers on the display panel are of a readable size, the Grams/Ounces/etc. is so tiny and in such a bad position that it is unreadable. Thus, when you are trying to change the unit of measurement, you have to hold the scale very close in order to even attempt to make it out. And I'm young and have excellent eyesight! It's really frustrarting, and I'd return it if I hadn't thrown out the box."
5,One of the best groundbreaking Christian thrash album ever!,"My recent order of CD's is all Deliverance! I had this on cassette for years, and it's still in my collection. It was 1989, I was a newly converted heavy metal kid, and this album blew me threw the wall! At the time I recently trashed an entire secular music collection, and wanted any kind of righteous powerful metal I could get. At the same time I was into Vengeance Rising, I really liked the way this band brought out the side of speed thrash that was siring melodies and strong melodic singing. It was like of like a mix of Slayer & Hirax with a strong sense of guitar melodies and harmonies. Back then I felt like I found the perfect thrash metal album."
4,Good buy!,"We bought these when they were $83, and for that price I expected the lamps to be slightly dodgy. One lampshade arrived with a crinkle, but nothing else was wrong with this set. They're fairly contemporary in style, and they compliment the rest of our furniture. We've got CFL bulbs in them, and they look great, no brown spots as the first reviewer noted. They were well-packaged, and it took me about 45 minutes to assemble all of them."
2,OK...Not good....,Very pretty. Very flimsy. Very light. One of the lamp's one socket broke in couple of weeks.... Still pretty.
5,An amazing guitar!,"The sound of both humbuckers are excelent, with a good amplifier the noise is cero, it's a solid and nice guitar to rock!! and with a multieffects the sound is even better!If you don't want to spend to much money, but you want a good guitar this is the best option for you.I'm very happy with this BC Rich Warlock!!"
1,Unless you like your guitar in the shape of a fish dont get this,"Alright Ive used this guitar for about 3-4 weeks its extremely uncomfortable to play when sitting down so this would only be comfortable to play while standing up with a strap on bottom line is the guitar looks ""cool"" at first but at this price a lot of kids will be buying this guitar thus making the unique look it has not so unique so if you buying this for the looks save your money its uncomfortable as hell to play while sitting down"
5,Excellent Product,"I bought this guitar not too long ago because I loved the sleek look of it. It reminded me a lot of Vortex's guitar (from Dimmu Borgir). I read most the reviews on here before and most of them commented about how uncomfortable it was playing with this sitting down. It's really not at all that uncomfortable. It has a really grungy sound too it, absolutely perfect for rock n roll or general metal. The finish was well done on this guitar and everything on it was in perfect condition, I could not find a single thing wrong with it. I found it very easy to play and it seems excellent on beginners. Combined with a Spider Line 6 app, it's absolutely perfect. It's pretty light compared to my other guitars as well (mainly cause it's made out of basswood).I truely recommend this guitar as it is more then what I expected from a $200 guitar."
4,Awesome,"Its a great guitar. One thing it could improve on is general sound. But when hooked up with a distrotion pedal and a nice amp, depending on what your going to play, for metal and infused metal. Its just great. I love it and Bc Rich is just a great guitar company. Also Squire fenders are just as good with a distrotion pedal and amp."
2,Excessive postage,"Product as written, NOT pleased with excessive charges for postage on each item (of three) ordered. These charges were triple cost indicated for postage on package."
2,Skip this and hit the stacks,"Not that these are bad songs, I can think of much better selections to fill this CD than what was provided. These are the same, stale, overplayed radio hit songs that everyone has heard. My advice to those who are really interested in disco: do it the old way and hit the vinyl stacks and find the REAL hits that were playing in the skating rinks or just turn on your variety station for a day or two and you will hear many of these, at least where I am. Maybe not in middle America but around here near NYC and Philly these songs are pretty cliche and common, certainly not rarities."
1,Scoliosis: Ascending the Curve,"This book was lacking any excitment that would allow a reader to connect to it. It read like a medical journal. It is however very informative, as a sort of guide book through scoliosis. But still a reader who does not have the disease will find it quite boring. The personal stories from the author attempted to take the cold impersonal tone away from the book. But the author failed in this attempt. The only thing left to say about this book is that it was a poorly writen book with too narow an intended audience."
4,Informative,"This book has help me understand in great detail how the spine vertbrae's are linked.With the surgeons letter i was able to see what parts of the spine where affected on my son.This helped to inform me, in a manner in which is easy to understand as the book is written in PLAIN English. I would Reccommend this book to parents or people with Scoliosis wishing to be informed without medical terms.Helps take away the fear of the unkown.rating by me 8 out 10."
3,Informative,"I found the book informative and an easy read, however it lacked excitement and was, at times, boring. As the mother of a patient fighting a different long-term chronic illness and the author of a book about that illness,[ASIN:0595470017 There Must Be A Reason: My Daughter's Battle With Wegener's Granulomatosis] I would have liked to read about the reactions and interactions of the families of the author and those people whose case histories she cites. More detail on the doctor-patient relationships and hospital stays Brooke experienced during her battle would have added to the story. I salute Brooke for sharing her story with the world and having the wherewithall to complete and publish her story. What we learn living with chronic illness either personally or within a family setting can help others and I believe Brooke's experiences touch on doing that."
3,Was a Big Budget Action Movie When Released - OK.,"Was a big budget action movie when released with all star cast. It is ok but acting is pondering, heavy, at times. Decent enough pacing. Story? Includes submarine and lots of shots of inside nuclear sub but not about sub. Rock Hudson as captain and he plays it ok. Overall, worth a look for this ""big budget"" Date movie? No women in picture, so no. Spousal unit? Maybe as no foul language and not overly violent."
1,"Man, this was painful to watch!","This movie was so bad, I couldn't get through it in one sitting; I had to turn it off and come back to it twice more before slogging through to the end. The characters were extremely weak. The plot contrivances were grating as well; how can some eighteen year-old just happen to arrive, meet someone who is willing to put him up in his apartment, then not much later, this kid finds the man with whom he wants to spend the rest of his life? I'm not buying it.The acting was way too melodramatic; with all the scenery-chewing, you would think it had been bankrolled by Bubble Yum.After finally getting though this atrocity, I watched the extras as well; the writer/director comes off as awfully arrogant for someone who directs low-budget films. He isn't even willing to take off his sunglasses or his Bluetooth in the interview and ""cribs"" feature.If you see this video being sold somewhere, leave it on the shelf, and back away."
1,Horrid.,"Absolutely one of the worst movies I have seen, and I tried really hard to find something worthwhile so as not to have considered it a total waste. Movie was mis-cast, directing was ""staged,"" and the acting was horrendous. Steer clear of this one... there are so many other, much better made (and deserving) movies."
1,This Movie Is Awful,"It's cloying, overacted, unrealistic, maudlin, saccharine, and just abysmal. This one is a real stinker."
1,this is maybe the worst movie i have ever seen,i can't describe how awful this is. i'm trying to think of 1 good think to say but i cannot. i'm sorry.
1,Another disastrous gay themed film,"I suppose it is possible that underneath this incompetent pile is a good story trying to get out. The Siskel and Eggbert review says it all, and more. Full marks to them for going to the trouble of delineating all the problems in the film. When oh when are queer filmmakers going to STOP making bad gay films? (Eg, Slutty Summer and Bowser Makes a Movie.) When oh when are they going to STOP using terrible drag queens in key roles. Are they the money? Is that how the films get up? The boy Billy was a lovely kid and his situation was very sympathetic. It was him and him alone that kept me watching. And I'm sentimental enough to be pleased with the happy ending. Beyond that?"
1,Home root canal is less painful,"It's hard to know who shoulders the most blame - the writer, the actors, or the folks who released it? Terrible stereotypes, rehashed predictable plot and possibly the worst acting I have ever seen. I turned it on, then skipped the first couple of tracks hoping it would get better - it didn't. One the few movies ever that I have shut off part way through (and I watch many films). I did find a use for it though, put little sticky pads on the bottom of it and use it as a coaster - more respect than it probably deserves."
2,An Angel With Clipped Wings,"Ouch! I'm writing this review with the film playing in the background, so sure am I that I'm not missing anything. The plot kinda resembles Sum of Us but without the good acting. And without the good production values. And without anything closely resembling a good movie. The plot has some possibilities but the writer/director squanders them on hollow, empty, stereotyped characters. At least the filmmaker didn't pander to the audience with nudity. As bad as this movie is, there's worse. But not many."
1,Don't waste your money!,This had to be the worst movie I have ever seen! The dialogue is horrible; the acting (if you can call it that) was atrocious; everything about it was such poor quality right on down the line. Do Not waste your money or your time watching it!
4,Quite a change from just a few years ago...,"This is the first CD of Noriko's that I've purchased without even knowing what it sounded like beforehand. It is definitely a different style than her earlier days as a teenaged jpop star. She is maturing more and more with each release. She seems to sing more and more with a lower voice, but the voice sounds much sexier if you ask me! Out of the two songs, ""Miss You"" is the better."
4,Fort Mose...a prtion of history,"I loved this book. It gave you an excellent look into Fort Mose and it's people; especially the African citizens (free or not) of the famous fort. It goes through the forts construction, to its abandonments and rediscovery. Yes, I did wish the book was more fleshy, but as a historian I know it is difficult to get the amount of information on personal lives and individuals and I commend the editors of this book. I sincerily hope there will be a follow up of this book, as it is an important addition to not only North American History and Florida (& Spanish Florida) history; but for Black History. I found this book by mistake, and enjoyed it a great deal!"
2,disappointing,"Being a displaced Austininte, I looked forward to reading this book because of its locale. Unfortunately, the plot and characters were poorly developed, sentences were often clumsily constructed, and the Austin historical snippets were repetitive and not terribly interesting.Guess I'll skip the next Zoe Barrow book, if there is one."
3,A bit heavy-handed,"[Spoilers]This would have been an intriguing play, and was well-executed. But I thought the long musings on why it was better to let sleeping dogs lie, and the philosophy of truth, were too heavy-handed.Still, the play was interesting."
3,Legolas and Horse-Toy Biz Deluxe Rider set,"Horse and rider are great if you want to just display them in the box or with Legolas standing beside the horse. The Legolas figure included isn't made to sit on the horse. There is another Legolas action figure which is very bendable and sits well in the saddle. If purchasing this for kids, I recommend buying the latest Legolas action figure to compliment the horse."
4,you must assemble !!!,"this rack is nice, but be aware that it comes in pieces and you must assemble this whole thing with wood glue."
3,A little More Magic,"Stuart Tosh, William Lyall and David Paton oddly enough hit upon the name Pilot by taking the first letters of their last names and adding a couple of vowels to them. They were from Edinburgh but found a recording contract at EMI and added Ian Bairnson from the first sessions. ""Magic"" of course their one big hit in North America but they had more success in England and Australia. This isn't a bad compilation, its just a matter of becoming familiar with the songs. We could really use some samples here on Amazon so that those who have never heard of many of Pilot's songs can sample them."
3,Talons of the Eagle,"Talons of the EagleThis DVD is definitely a VHS rip. The picture is poor quality, but for those of us who really like this movie, it is watchable."
1,"The worst film since, well, ever.",Ed Wood could have done a better job of directing this film than Michael. This is the worst film I have ever seen. I'd rather bang my head against a brick wall than have to watch this movie again!
3,Almost Great,"This is almost a comprehensive set of music that includes horns. However, there are a few small problems. Chicago, perhaps the greatest band to ever use a horn section is missing. Secondly, Spiral Starecase (More Today Than Yesterday) is another short lived one hit wonder who used brass in all of their songs...not to mention the neglected Buckinghams. Besides these few oversites, the CD is worth the investment."
4,Pretty Nice CD,"(Re)mastering could have been better, but adequate. My only main complaint was the song, ""One Fine Morning"", by Lighthouse. From the reviews of other CDs, this song has been remastered and sounds so different than the ""hit"" version. Actually, it might make you believe it's a remake, if you're familiar with the non remastered version."
3,Nice but not 5 stars.,"I thought that this book might have some things that I haven't already seen elsewhere. It is well written and an easy read, but nothing else new."
2,Buy the Fundamentals of Nursing Instead,"In general, this clinical book is *exactly* the same as the Fundamentals of Nursing: Concepts, Process, and Practice, 7th edition. You will find word for word passages from the Fundamentals book in the clinical one.The plus side to purchasing the clinical book is that it has more pictures and is a bit more concise in true 'clinical' information. If, however, you are on a very tight budget then skip the clinical book and put your money into a good 7th edition copy."
4,Like the case but it is hard to dock,"The case is excellent in the way it looks and feels. It protects the entire iPod extremely well. It is sticky in your hand or on dash of your car. The plastic faceplate is brilliant in the way it protects and guides your thumb around the wheel.My only real complaint is that it's compatibility with speaker docks is limited. It will not work in my Altec Lansing IM11, nor will it work with a Nyko Speaker Dock 2. It does fit into Memorex clock-radio, and into the official apple universal dock without an adapter. I had a very difficult time inserting it into a dock with the flap over the docking port cover, but after cutting it off it works well. It is possible with the flap intact, but it took me a long time time every time i tried and it would wiggle loose. It is looser than a naked iPod with the correct adapter, but not bad."
4,Very Nice Intro,"This is a very good introduction to the field of space nuclear power. The authors provide adequate background material and include discussion and simple mathematical analysis methods to promote understanding of the various topics; e.g., neutronics, shielding, heat transport and rejection, and safety. Major programs are discussed in sufficient detail and technical issues are enumerated and discussed. The book is well written and easy to follow. Some of the latter chapters, however, are not as cleanly organized as the early chapters. Nonetheless, the book is concise, clear and essentially unique in its coverage of the diverse field of space nuclear power."
4,One Of The Best New Artist Of The Year,"When I first heard her voice I could not help it but to think of Lucianda Williams. Kasey Chambers music is a mix between country and folk rock, but more on the rock side (except for the last track on The Captain, ""We're All Gonna Die Someday."") She is truly worthy of being called a musician. She writes excellent lyrics and songs. She is one of the best new artists to come out this year. The Captain is definetly worth hearing. She is the second best thing that comes from Australia for me (my favorite thing that comes from Australia: FOSTERS beer! lol). This album will surely be nominated for best new artist at the Grammy's! And I am pretty sure that we will be hearing more about her in the future. I just hope that she does not cross over to pop like Shania Twain and Faith Hill!"
5,Rockabilly Masterpiece from Down Under,"If the Nashville music scene were not dominated by Yankee businessmen whose focus is on pandering to the mass audience of teeny-boppers and suburban soccer moms,which has them push sugary, poppish drivel like Garth Brooks, Shania Twain, and Faith Hill, more people would have heard of this album. I caught the title cut on an independent radio station that plays traditional country, country rock, Southern rock, folk rock, bluegrass, and blues. I was bowled over by 'The Captain.' When I got the album, I discovered the title cut to be the weakest among the first 7, and both 'The Hard Way' and 'Don't Go' are each as good as 'The Captain.' There is not a single throwaway on this album. Chambers' lyrics are piercing. The guitar work throughout is sharp, never ostentacious, never cheap. Chambers' voice is an original: plaintive, wailing, keening. She would be ideal to keen over the massacred at Culloden or the corpse of Ned Kelly."
4,Good new old-fashioned country,"A stunning album that will appeal to anyone who likes good music - not just country.The only thing that stops me giving this 5 stars is the final track - lyrically not great.Aside from that, Kasey's voice is beautiful - almost childlike, blending wonderfully with Julie Miller's harmonies on The Captain. Other highlights are the upbeat Cry Like a Baby and the lilting, haunting ballad 'These Pines'."
4,Good first effort,"Don't know how old Kasey Chambers is, (from the look of the album cover, I'd say about 21) but this album smacks of a debut by a prodigy. Chambers has an excellent country music voice that makes her sound not at all like she's from her native Austrailia. She can also write a good solid hook or two as she does with the single ""Cry Like a Baby,"" ""The Captain"" ""You Got the Car"" and a couple of others. If this album has a flaw it is that there are a few less successful tracks in its second half. That said, the down home anthem ""We're All Gonna Die Someday,"" that closes the record might be the best tune while also sounding the closest to traditional country. It is, however, the song's sense of humor that leads you to believe that Ms. Chambers might have a long and satisfying career ahead of her.Overall, a solid debut album from a youngster who seems determined to become a star."
5,Kasey is a *TRUE STAR*,"When I first heard Kasey on stage in 1999 the hairs on the back of my neck stood up - here was an almost unknown singer with an AMAZING voice, and singing AMAZING words! She deserves world-wide recognition for the eerie quality of her voice, and the words of her songs which strike a chord with all of us. If you haven't heard Kasey, you are missing out! 10 **STARS**"
3,"Nice, ""safe"" album by an young artist.","So Kasey Chambers has an ""over-average"" debut and everybody (Australians) salutes her? First of all I must say that it's very good that she writes her own music. That fact is worth at least one star alone.! She sometimes not only cries like- but also -sings like a baby. The productions of some of the songs are terrible, and together with her sometimes (a bit) annoying voice it just doesn't sound too good. Except for that she has some catchy tunes and a fine band to back her up."
1,"Ready, Aim, FIRE!!!!","Bloody Hell. If only ""No Stars"" was an option. Kasey Chambers' ""The Captain"" is one of the more nauseating assembleges of trite, tired, and beat-to-death-boring cliches released in recent memory. Miraculously, she somehow manages to lurk all over popular radio stations. Reading comparisons to the likes Emmilou Harris or Patty Griffin conjure up sounds of screaching tires - Kasey (note trite spelling of name) does not possess a fraction of a percentage of the talent held by those two women. ""The Captain"" is great for people who require the lowest common denominator-over produced garbage in order to recognize emotions in music. Listening to the CD, I face an overwhelming urge to make up my own lyrics. It's the only defense to an otherwise devastatingly boring stretch of 4 minutes."
5,Closest thing to Nanci since....,"....well..Nanci. My wife actually came down the stairs and asked if I was playing a new Nanci Griffith album. Lots of folks are comparing her style to Lucinda Williams, but her euro-lilt and gentle tone are all Nanci Griffith. Still, whatever comaprison you make, the result is the same; Kasey Chambers combines a strong sweetness with a powerful lyric and folk-rock style to come up with something really enjoyable."
5,Wow!,"The best new artist to appear in a long time. I tend to buy older stuff, because most new music is so bad. But Kasey gets more than her share of playing time with this great record. Great voice, great tunes. BUY it now!!! Best CD of the year (and the decade?)"
3,"Light-weight, but refreshing","At the end of the day, despite a few great tunes and some truly pretty singing, this album comes across as a light-weight pop-product. I'm not totally disapointed, and the album certainly does have its moments, but the over-earnest tone often seems a little to precious. Infact, some of these doormat- ""I'll always be your woman""- anthems would make Tammy Wynette wince... they border on self parody. At its best, though, the record is tuneful, exuberant, and leaves me with some hope for the next release. Just don't expect the next Lucinda Williams."
3,"A few good tracks, but contrived.","I bought this album, because, like another reviewer, I heard the song, ""The Captain"" on ""The Sopranos"" and broke my neck finding out where to get it. I liked the song because I interpreted it differently - I saw it as a feminist parody because I decided that it could not possibly be taken literally. Anyway, I liked ""Cry Like a Baby"" and the old traditional sound of ""The Pines"" but found the remainder of the tracks containing trite lyrics and contrived vocals desperately trying to sound down-home. It gets worse and worse as the CD plays on - at ""Southern Kind of Life"", you just have to laugh."
2,"good subject, but kinda tedious","Ramirez explores the academic literature on Latino machismo, especially as it affects Puerto Rico. He questions the underpinnings of this concept and asks if it depends upon class or is an Anglocentric, racist projection. Those interested in Puerto Rican studies should purchase this book. However, it was somewhat boring and overly sociological. It's far slower than Mirande's ""Hombres y Machos"" and far weaker than Gonzalez' ""Muy Macho"". The chapter on male homosexuality seemed entirely stolen from other academics. I'm a big fan of men's studies books and yet I wasn't quite impressed with this one."
5,wows def worth the wait,"another great great portfolio from michael manning, i am eagerly looking forward to buying his other 4 new portfolios, i look forward to hopefully the next chapter of the Spider Garden"
3,Dissapointing,"I have played this with two people and we both found it somewhat boring. It might be fun with a larger group. However, the reason we are unlikely to play it again is that the cards have a texture that makes them stick together which makes it hard to handle them."
5,Invaluable,The Haynes manuals have been my go to source for problem solving when it comes to my vehicles.
3,"Cute puzzle, so-so construction","Overall, this was a fun puzzle. The image itself was not especially difficult. I completed the puzzle within a week.However, the randomly cut pieces were sometimes difficult to work with. Some pieces were very thin, or odd shapes that were too similiar in cut to other pieces. Often these pieces would interlock in places they did not belong. The overall quality was not as good as other brands, but the image was of good quality worhty to be glued and hung for decoration. I only took off stars for the construction quality of some of the pieces that raised not the difficulty factor, but just the frustration factor."
2,eh...,"This cd is ok. They kind of rip off number One Gun- and the guy's voice is annoying. Nothing special, and the songs seem like they were just thrown together."
5,Awesome,"Amazon continue to impress with their standard of communication, service and great deals. Sound The Alarm is a band I had not heard of before but I was pleasantly surprised when I listened to their CD.Thanks Amazon for continuing recommendations and providing outstanding service."
1,Weak Arguments,"Nagel thinks that private property and incomes proceed from a system of justice necessarily supported by taxes, and as such justice is prior to private property. That argument would make sense if a coherent system of justice could be devised to match it. As it stands, Nagel only has moral theories, and everybody has one of those.Nagel tells us we cannot appeal to private property in order to justify the current distribution within society, because it is private property itself is that which needs distributing. Basically Nagel is opting for a collectivist (moralist) starting point in which every person must justify their holdings to Nagel's morality. The obvious alternative, Lockean rights theory, is dismissed on the grounds that ""there are no property rights antecedent to the tax structure.""Of course Nagel can define property rights how he wishes, but there have been plenty of instances of property rights (as most people understand them) in the absence of tax structures."
1,What a waste of ink,"The short version of this dopey book is this: Without Uncle Sam to protect your stuff you'd probably get mugged without hope of getting it back. Therefore you dont actually own it. I think most mafia dons think along these lines.In another context, the money sitting in your banks safe doesn't actually belong to you. It belongs to the security guard who keeps it from getting stolen.John Locke is spinning in his grave. The Sophists are laughing their butts off."
2,Not their best.,"I have all 5 Da Buzz albums. This one is not my favorite. It has a couple of great songs on it, but that's it. Get the other four albums, they are full of wonderfull songs."
5,GREAT PRODUCT!!!!!!,"This DVD is great. Mr. Franco has come up with many unique and innovative workouts for this piece of equipment. He even shows you how fill, adjust, and move the bag. These workouts will enhance the skills of any martial artist or someone interested in REALITY BASED SELF DEFENSE."
3,B.O.B Training DVD,"It's a ""think out side the box"" dvd. More of a set up for his other dvd's. You're not going to be a pro fighter after this, but all in all a good tool to add to your toolbox"
2,Low quality video and vulgar,"I would rate this DVD higher except for two things:1. Very low quality video and audio. They are in a room and echo's aren't dealt with so it sounds like a video filmed by a kid in their garage.2. They felt the need to include vulgar cussing in the simulated fight scenarios. Sure, that's the way it would likely sound but its not something I want to watch more than once. Its just low class and unprofessional. They could have taught the moves without the constant cussing.The content of the video seems better than some other's I've seen but I threw it away after watching it one time."
3,its good.....,"I had very high expectations for this toy. The vibrations are amazing, and the size is ... well its wow! :) but the vibrations are mostly in the tip. I'm not sure if its the one that I got, or all of them, but i have to leave the bottom unscrewed a little bit or it doesnt work. anyways, all in all its a mediocre toy, with good strong vibrations and its quiet."
3,=/,"I'm really disappointed, I L O V E D this vibe, it took a little warming up to due to its size, but once I got used to it it was such an intense orgasm. It's ""waterproof"" so I took it into the shower, but water managed to get in somehow and it stopped working after only 3 weeks :(Maybe if you're REEEEEALLY careful with it, it will last longer. If it wasn't for the fact that it gave out so quickly, I would definitely recommend it, it is easy to use and is pretty powerful when you use it at it's highest setting."
3,its pretty blue,"i think that it needs to be a little longer, to get at the control dial. i really like the bumps."
5,nice mid-size,"This is my first purchase that doesn't have a remote--I like it much better! The material is easier to clean than nu-skin. This is a nice size without being too big and is waterproof. I LOVE the controls being an easy to use dial instead of buttons. So far, so good, definitely looking at more Doc Johnson products in the future."
4,An interesting perspective on Allen's major films,Peter Baily establishes his thesis that a primary thread running through many of Allen's major films is an examination of the tension between art and life and the struggle of the artist to disengage from the real world to unleash the creative juices. Citing examples from many of my favorite Allen films and following through on his major premise Baily delivers a fine book that challenged me to look at this films from a new perspective. I highly recommend this to fans of Woody Allen. I am cueing up my DVD copy of Hannah and her Sisters as soon as I log off.
4,Different!!,"The locations in this book were different than most historical romances. I love books where I learn something new! The story is based in the area of the Mediterranean Sea and gypsy cities. I enjoy a book where the female characther is strong and determined. Dominique Willoughby stands her ground throughout the novel and will bend for no man. I found Nicholas kind of difficult to like thoughout the novel, but I liked him a lot in the end. You realize Nicholas's hardness at times was only because he had everyone else's interest at heart. Kit Garland pays attention to details in her writing style and appears to have thoroughly researched her information. I found the book suspenseful with mystery added to the plot. I will look forward to reading her other novels."
3,Luxury portfolio but not total protection,"When I bought an IBM ThinkPad X31 4 years ago, I purchased a Targus portfolio specifically designed for the X series and I am very satisfied with it. So when I bought a X61 recently, I searched online for the same portfolio from Targus but I could only find this ""upgraded"" leather version of the earlier one, at the same price of $30. When I received the item, I compared it against my old one and found that this leather one is heavier. The material is surely better (leather outside and velvet inside) with additional pouches and a dividing pad. However it closes with a latch instead of a zipper (as used in the older version). I would prefer the zipper version because it fully covers the laptop and prevents contact with other items in my backpack (e.g. spilled water). With the zipped portfolio, I can carry it in my hand even walking in a light drizzle without worrying about the laptop getting wet."
4,The Undead Express (Shadow Zone),I gave this book to my nephew and he could not put it down until he finished it. He's now hooked! This fits right into the genre of what kids love reading these days!
1,Poorest of the series,"I've really enjoyed the Daisy Dalrymple series, but this one was truly terrible. It was as if someone else had written the second half. It all starts promising enough, I was enjoying it very much, until about two-thirds of the way into it. Then, everything fell apart. Interesting characters were never more to be seen, the unmasking of the murderer was completely anticlimatic. It felt like the author suddenly stopped midway through the book and quickly decided to pick a murderer at random. Really awful, the real mystery is: what happened in the writing of this book? I'm a bit wary of buying anymore in the series if the next one is going to be the same."
2,There is good and bad......,"I purchased this Jelly Roll Air Pan to roast sweet potato fries coated with peanut oil and corn starch. The corn starch gives oven baked French Fries a good crunch and maintains a nice orange color. However, the corn starch is very sticky so the Wilton Jelly Roll Air Pan seemed to be the way to go; no stick and resistance to burning food.The Good: Heavy weight/heavy duty, good burn resistance.The Bad: Even with the exclusive use of plastic spatulas, the no-stick finish has chipped and is peeling off after using the pan 3 times.The Solution: I purchased a 16ga heavy half sheet baking pan and a matching non-stick baking mat. The sweet potato fries actually come out way better using the sheet pan and the non-stick baking mat. This appears to be a better long term alternative since there is no coating to chip or burn off."
2,Not Very Good,"I don't like leaving poor reviews but these pans are not very good. First use at correct temperatures in a freshly cleaned oven produced marks (brown streaking ) on the bottom and top of the pans , and I was only making french fries. I have decided I'm done with coated pans. At least with metal pans you can scrub the heck out of them opposed to having pans that appear filthily. I'm not new to cooking. I am a wife and mother of 8 so its not experience thats the issue.These pans are just poor."
1,Don't buy it,Pan quickly started to peel. Please don't waste your $$. I would rate it a 0 if i could :(.
2,Non-stick coating peeled after 2nd use!,"Received my pan and was really excited to use it! After the second use, the non-stick coating started to peel! I am meticulous about my kitchen ware, so nothing abrasive used (only silicone utensils) and both times it was hand-washed after use! This was supposed to replace my previous pan that I'd had for several years, but it's now virtually useless!"
1,Coating peeled from the pan after 5 uses,"Nice pan, but after 5 uses the non stick coating peeled from the pan. It started coming of in chunks. We didn't us it harshly or use and sharp implements."
1,NOT! CATHOLICISM,"This book is titled incorrectly. It should be titled Catholicism NOT! This book received a scathing review from Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk when he was head of the US Catholic Bishop's Conference Committee on Doctrine. The major overall flaw is ""doctrinal minimalism."" The book presents dissenting theological opinions on such controversial issues as womens' ordination(NEVER) and homosexuality(ALWAYS EVIL) as if the faithful may choose which they prefer. The book is OBE'd. The 1998 change in Canon Law issued by the motu proprio Ad Tuendam Fidem with the attached doctrinal explanation Ab Ipsis Primordis, clarifies that the faithful must hold the magisterial position on these matters. Perhaps Encyclopedia of Heresy might be a good title."
1,A waste of money,"I own two of McBrien's books (Catholicism & Encyclopedia). They look very serious on Catholicism, but they are NOT. They contain a lot of McBrien's thoughts about what should be Catholicism. In other words, McBrien wishes the Catholic Church to conform to his opinions. A waste of money. If you want to know about Catholicism, buy the Catechism of the Catholic Church instead. For more detailed review on McBrien's books, go to catholicculture.org and search for McBrien."
1,This book is NOT about Catholicism,"This book is very dangerous to read for both Protestants and Catholics because it does NOT contain the truth of the Catholic Faith. The entries are very highly unorthodox and inaccurate, extremely liberal and modernist. With its authoritative title, it deliberately misleads the reader into thinking it is an authoritative work condoned by the Catholic Church. I mistakenly bought the book wanting a reference book on Catholicism, but now keep it as a reference to see just what is being touted as Catholic doctrine by those within the Faith who are trying to destroy it from within."
5,A highly readable reference work,"I use the Harper Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism extensively in the study of Church history. It is well indexed and highly readable. Among its contents are an historical time line, a concise summary of the Ecumenical Councils and a brief note on each Pope -- all of which elucidate the interplay of European history, the papacy and the councils in the development of Catholicism."
3,"Good Definitions, But.........","I got this book about 4 years ago and it does give great information and pictures that help in the understanding of catholicism, but is written on the point of view on the liberal side. Richard McBrien, the author, tends to bring opinions from somewhere other than the Magisterium of the Church on issues that bring heated debate within the people of the Church. If a non-catholic picks this book up and looks up information on issues such as sexuality, they will get the wrong idea on what the church really teaches. But for the most part though, the book is very thorough on most items such as people of the Church. A whole section on St. Augustine will give you everything you need to know about this popular saint. I recommend this book only to find historical facts, not for facts on morality."
3,"Cute, but not enlightening","This silly little book makes the obvious argument for creationism, ""cleverly"" observing how unlikely it seems that we humans just woke up and found ourselves here in all our glory. The evidence supporting evolution is harder to explain in 100 words or less, perhaps, but that's no excuse for pretending it doesn't exist."
1,Creationist Propaganda,"William Steig has written some very wonderful, charming books like ""Amos and Boris"" and ""Sylvester and the Magic Pebble."" But this book isn't charming or wonderful; its only attribute is that it is advocates Creationism. The story consists of two wooden dolls who wake up and try to figure out where they came from--whether they were made by someone or just accidentally created by nature. Unlike Steig's other books, the story is rather flat and not very entertaining.If you are a creationist looking for a book to help indoctrinate your kids, you'll love this book. But otherwise, you definitely will want to look elsewhere."
3,"Sounds fine for 1955, but nothing earth-shattering.","There are tons of great recordings of Bruckner's 4th, probably with the 7th his most popular. If you want a few 'historical' recordings to round out your collection, and like Schuricht, I would suggest his recording of the 8th, which you can find on a couple of different issues. Otherwise for vintage Bruckner, Furtwangler, Knappertsbusch and Bruno Walter may be better bets. The sound is good for the era it was recorded, but it's a crowded field even within the subset ofhistorical recordings."
3,You get what you pay for,"I purchased these along with the name brand BD&A; silicone skins that you will find at any retailer.The difference is that the name brand ones are much thicker and do not smell.These are very thin, they stretch very easily so that it gets deformed when you play the game. The nunchuk skin is actually fine, because it doesnt move much. However the Wiimote skin can be problematic because it may move over buttons. The good part about its thinness is that its easier to press buttons though, so I appreciate that.There is also a strange smell that lasts for quite a while. It obviously comes from the silicone, it doesnt smell bad but its strange. The smell gets lighter as you use it more though, but it does get on your hands.Overall if you are on a budget and need some slim grips for your Wii, then its worth it. Otherwise, go with thicker ones."
3,I don't recomend it,"I am a great fan of Alex Ross, when I saw the picture of this figures I got very impressed. Air brush in painting and excelent model. I tought ""I got to buy it"". But... the figures are not like the picture (a least superman and wonder woman, which I bought), in fact are awfully painted, plain colors, articulations are useless, model is a little different, make them looks like a cheap toy. Superman has painted lips, looks like a Revlon advertising. So Im very disapointed, I feel cheated. They didn't give me what they show in the picture."
5,A Hit!!,"This is a great album, I couldnt get enough of it, I really enjoyed Mercury To Go! It was a great song off of a great album!--Brian!"
1,The emperor has no clothes,"Wondering why prayer works on TV? Want to know why people call up TBN, estatic about getting a 100,000 dollars after giving 100 dollars to the guys at TBN? Want to know why none of this works in real life - like on TV? Could it be that Avanzini is a crook? No! It's YOUR fault. Or, at least that's what the book wants you to believe. This is some of the worst of ""prosperity gospel"" heresy. I'm now waiting for a band of Christians, armed with ""WWJD"" bracelets, to come and start tipping over tables at their local churches that peddle this silliness. And some Christians wonder why people hate them...."
1,The Prophet of Profit Strikes Again,"In this book, John Avanzini attempts to give biblical reasons why people who give money to God in return for financial blessing do not receive it. The reasons the author gives seems to indicate there is something wrong with the giver. In my opinion this book tries to pacify people burned by the give-to-get myth perpetuated by Word-Faith preachers like Avanzini who part people from their money. Nice attempt at damage control caused by even his own teaching. Avoid his books and this cultic teaching."
2,Not as described.,"The seller described the book in ""Very Good/Like New"" condition. Since when did very good include spills on the edges of the book so that all the pages stick together? And when did it include writing all over the inside cover of the book? Honestly, I would return it if I could. I only gave it two stars, because apparently, Amazon labels one star as ""I hate it"", and while I certainly highly dislike it, I don't exactly hate it."
1,Not a kit,"I didn't get the ""kit,"" just the book. So I had to go out and buy the stuff to make the sushi. It was a big idea of mine to start making sushi, but now I just buy it at the grocery store! Much less work!"
3,A little bit...,"...uncomprehensive. It focused on a few topics, but the essays were really specific. It wasn't really helpful for my research paper, because I needed more general Edith Wharton critisism. This is one to get from the library, not to buy."
2,"As pictured, but very poor sound quality.","The item was as pictured. I bought it to lay inside of a clay seashell for my Ursula costume at halloween. There were actually two, which I didn't expect, so that was a nice surprise. It was a bit too big for my purpose, but it's an odd purpose so I don't fault the product at all. Only problem is he sound quality was so poor, the voice of Ariel singing was crackly and unrecognizable. Should have at least not had all the crackles."
5,voice recorder,I ordered this for a friend who is legally blind to help him find stuff in his refrigerator. He and I both are very pleased. It's easy to use.
5,voice recorder,"Arrived quickly. Worked great, easy to use, plenty loud...attached it to the back of a large picture frame for 100yr old grandma since I couldn't find a talking picture frame that held an 8 x 10. A very inexpensive way to spice up a picture or whatever!"
4,Neat little gadget,"I used this to make a totebag musical, and it worked pretty well- the only ""cons"" were that it was kind of bulky for my purpose, and that there really wasn't a volume control on the piece when recording. The sound was quite clear (if soft), and I like the fact that the batteries are replaceable. Overall, though, it works great in stuffed toys ( I made a small hidden pocket in the toy to place it in so it can be removed for battery replacement and washing the toy), and I will most likely be ordering more."
4,An aencyclopedia of international accounting,"It is a very complete work, describing all the rules and accounting standard of many countries. It is very detailed and easy to read. Not too involved in theory."
3,"This is a Vocal Drama CD, not a Soundtrack","While I would agree with Peter that Escaflowne has stunningly beautiful music, I have to believe he was reviewing something other than this particular CD. WARNING: This is a VOCAL DRAMA presentation, not a sountrack; if you're not fluent in Japanese, you'll get little out of this!For what it is, however, it's rather well done."
3,"This is a Vocal Drama CD, not Music","While I would agree with Peter that Escaflowne has stunningly beautiful music, I have to believe he was reviewing something other than this particular CD.

2,Afghanistan: The Road to Kabul,"Exceptionally disappointing! Photographic quality is very blured and inferior. Oft times a dirt rut is the center of interest or an individual photographed from the neck down. I would have liked to see the expression on the face instead of the buttons on the coat. The photographs are presented in groups with no stated purpose for that particular collection. There is no verbage accompanying any of the photographs which makes it difficult to understand the purpose of its having being taken. About all I see is the ""road"" to Kabul and not much more."
4,"Hot, but not TOO hot!","The chili pepper spices up this olive nicely. On a ""hot scale"" of 1 to 10 this pepper stuffed olive is probably a 6 in hotness. Good product."
5,"""Totally AWESOME!""","This was a Santa gift for my 6 y/o. It was larger than we expected, and the package under the tree was quite impressive!My son LOVES this. He has an R2D2 that fits in it perfectly. Luke wasn't easy to get in the seat, but he does fit (watch out for the hands - they do come off!).My only minor complaint is that one of the laser cannons kept falling off. That was solved with a little super glue. Otherwise, this is, in my son's words, ""Totally AWESOME!"""
5,Excellent toy,"As yet we haven't given this to our son, its a Christmas present but my husband is pretty excited about it!!! We were delighted to open the box and see the quality and also the size of this toy. It is definitely money well spent!"
2,Star Wars X-wing Fighter,I was very disappointed in this purchase. The wings have 2 clip on additions that will not stay on. With just simple movement they fall off all the time. :-(
3,Too much delay,"I purchased the X-wing fighter for my Grandson for his birthday. I am not near my grandson so I cannot rate the toy on educational, durability or fun factor but I do know that my Grandson was so excited to receive it.My biggest disappointment is how long it took for my Grandson to receive the item after I ordered it. I orderd it for his birthday and it did not arrive on time, and almost 20 days after his birthday. I am not sure I would order another item if could not be guaranteed of an on time delivery.Linda"
5,The Thinking Mans Football Book,"Brilliant Orange is more than just a history of Dutch football. It cleverly links the Dutch idea of football to art, architecture, culture, politics and philosophy. The book uses interviews with top Dutch footballers such as Ruud Krol, Johnny Rep and Dennis Bergkamp to provide a fascinating insight into a unique culture in which football plays an integral part. The chapters describing 'Total Football' during the 1970's are particularly interesting however the book can become a little tedious when it wanders from the topic of football.I enjoyed this book a lot because it is original, unconventional and informative. It is easy to read and provides a useful introduction for anybody wanting to learn about this most intriguing of footballing nations. The book will interest people who are interested in the ideas behind football rather than a simple narrative history of football in Holland."
5,Aragorn and Brego are the best!,A great toy.pretty cool.(sound familyer comin'from me right?)Thanks for reading my reviw.
2,Dont buy instant video,With the amazon instant video you get nothing special about your down load just a movie no xtras at all such a rip off someone needs to tak this upp with consumer affairs like when game stop didnt give you the code to play when buying used games this is the same thing.
2,people opinons,the movie was just aboput the music of the who through the eyes of other people....it was kinda dumb....the only reason i gave it a two was because it had some cool who footage..
3,;),"I love that none of you have pointed out that the entry by Edward McGuire is a fraud by an Australian satirist. With a bit of wikipedia you'd see that Eddy McGuire is a crappy Australian gameshow host and TV executive. Not only that, his entry was just a Cindy Sheehan article with the adition of the microsoft office Find and Replace tool. Bloody yanks."
1,dvd dont play in Australia,Purchased these dvd and it does not play in Australia why do you send them to an Australian AddressDo I return them and get my money back
3,Weak,I was looking for more action prior to them entering the league (while they were in highschool)....not what I was expecting. Disappointed!!!
2,Sharper Image Hybrid GP Germicidal Air Purifier,"I have a Sharper Image Hybrid GP Germicidal Air Purifier S1724GRY. It is about 7 months old and it has stopped working. Sharper Image customer phone line, and web site offers no help in returning the device for repair / replacement. I purchased a 5 year warranty on the unit.Is there any hope of Sharper Image repairing it? If not, who repairs them? Or, how can I trouble shoot it myself?Hope someone out there can offer some help.thanks"
4,Purifier review,"I have had this purifier for a little over a year. It seems to do a great job cleaning the air, and the air smells very fresh when you come into the room. The only concern that I have is cleaning it. The metal blades seem to have some type of coating that is peeling off - might be all those dirt/mineral deposits. And, I can't seem to completely get those off, which might affect the effectiveness of the unit. Otherwise, it's great."
3,Blades are bad,"I have owned my Hybrid GP about 45 days. I have cleaned it 3 times and exclusively with their provided brush. On the third clean, I noticed the blades were not perfectly straight, some looked wavy. On a closer inspection I saw the edges of most blades starting to peal off. It seems like the blades have some kind of plastic coating. I am disappointed with the material quality of the blade unit. I paid allot of money for this and I expect excellent quality. I am returning it, and not taking a chance on a replacement unit."
3,Worth the price?,"These ""purifiers"" all of them, do help but by no means the all in one fix for allergies and dust. You will still have allergies perhaps not as bad, you will still have dust accumilate in your house aswell.As for cleaning, just remove the grill, hose it down, rag towel wipe dry and your done! Like new again.Big price tag on silent or for this model near silent operation. If you really want a air purifier and you can not stand the loud noise of the other models then be prepare to ante up for these premium priced purifiers. But performance wise they are no better, just quieter."
2,Not as expected,"I bought this as a gift, thinking it was an episode per chef and it was only ONE meal. That's it. One of the meals was just a desert. I would not get the 3 chef collection again."
4,Shocking that the Media blames President Bush,"I've read several books about the Clinton years, and was still shocked by the information in ""Intelligence Failure"". How could our country be so stupid about what went on during the Clinton Administration. How dare the media, and the deceived public blam President Bush for 9/11 when he had only been in office for 8 months. ""Intelligence Failure"" is yet another expose as to the goings-on of the Clinton Administration, and what that legacy is going to leave us...and what is yet to come from that legacy. It's a must read if you are interrested in what happened in the 90's and what is yet to result from the 90's leadership."
1,Conspiracy theory 70.2,"They obviously never get tired of it. The umpteenth book with the same legends copied from all the other conspiracy theorists - I guess Bossie wanted to have his share of the bucks. That's understandable. The sad thing is not the illectual disingenuity of Bossie, Coulter, Morris & co. Sad are all these people who'll buy this wish-wash. Not recognizing that they now own about seventy versions of the same book."
1,lies,This book is full of logiacal falicies and other right wing propaganda. Why linger on the past and try to blame all the problems you can on Clinton. Is someone trying to take focus off one president and put it on another. If the republicans were so concerned about the 9/11 attacts they would stop trying to place blame and work to prevent another from happening. this book is on a Moot subject and is a complete waste of time
3,More info than 9/11 report Caution: NOT P/C,"Bossie has written a well documented, well organized inclusive chronology of events of massive intelligence/national security emasculation by Clinton. A this is a 'what happened' book, not analysis, opinion or qualitative verbiage. Example: Marvin Cetron, professional futurists, wrote scenarios for Dep of State in 1992 forecasting crashing planes into buildings naming World Trade Center...multiple simultaneous attacks. Marvin is not in 9/11 report. Why listen to Marvin? He is the guy who forecast that Saddam would invade Kuwait...three years before the fact. Thank you Bossie for a complete record. Would be better if jacket cover did NOT have pejorative picture of Clinton on it...Bossie's book is not a personal attack on Clinton...just the facts, Mam, the sad murderous facts.Rene"
1,low quality,"Some of the pages are detached from the book. The quality of the book is not expected. Too many highlights in the book, but I don't mind. Only the detached pages bother me."
2,Karl Malden is The Green Lantern,"Why's he look so old? I guess it looks cool, but I'll probably just throw it in the closet, since he just looks...uncomfortable."
4,My daughter does this workout over and over.,"My daughter received the Swan Lake DVD as a birthday gift yesterday. She does it with great enthusiasm--at least she tries. It's a little fast-paced for a kid with no formal dance training, but she enjoys it anyway. As much as she watches it, I think she'll get it. Each song on the DVD very quickly teaches a different aspect of ballet--stretch, different dance steps, emotion, curtsy. At the end of the video, the dancers perform onstage and are then showered with roses from their audience.Unlike my 5-year old daughter, I am really in agony hearing the music from this video that sounds like it was written by Barney the dinosaur and sung by an overly excited Disney princess."
4,Swan Lake is much better than Lets Dance DVD,"The Bella Dancerella DVD from 2003 was the Bella Dancerellas first attempt at this concept so its a little crude but my 3 year old still likes it. Swan Lake is from 2006 and does a much better job. My daughter got both for Christmas and has been watching them daily. Its nice because even though shes watching TV shes moving along with the DVD. I would recommend it for kids who love to pretend, imitate and follow directions."
5,A true classic!,"This is an almost indispensable book for all Civil War aficionados, covering everything from pistols to ironclads and steamships. The author's own illustrations add to the charm and value of this publication and make its information accessible even to the novice. Many Civil War fans have known this book for years and will be delighted to find that it is once again readily available. A true classic, this book belongs in every Civil War library!"
2,Photos are compelling however&#65533;,"I found the fotos were interesting however I live blocks from ground zero and I am a professional (& Famous) photographer. Many of my friends are fireman , police, FEMA and rescue workers... In my opinion the book is pushing the authors religious beliefs - I have a problem with this --- I am not cetain that the money is going to profit the victims- I have seen what they have taken fotos of & they should give the money to the victoms - not for their personal religious causes!"
4,Falconry & Hawking,A sport/lifestyle I always have been interested in! Moving to South America (Uruguay) to be able to fly Falcons! Wish me luck!
3,Not for USA Falconers,This book is definitly not for North American falconers. Many topics seem out dated.This book does have some interesting information on glove making and bell making.
1,Get me a goblin bookburner and fast!,"<deep sigh>The game is great, the book is not. Incomplete is the best way to describe it. Poor listing of items, armor, and monsters. Badly organized strategy making finding help a real pain at times. A general lack of answers. Poorly marked maps. Not good. Not good at all. A lot of stuff in NWN is random and I can't fault them for not covering it, but even on the simplest of questions there was no information to be found or at least not in a way that I could find it in over 20 minutes with the book. Sorry, but I'd rather be playing than looking for an answer that may or may not exist. Hey...I hear the world building guide is pretty good though. Glad to know they put some effort into something."
4,Not bad,"I definitley can't speak for the rest of the people who reveiwed this game guide but I found it to be informative and detailed. I'm new to the rpg gameing experience so people who have played rpg's for a while might dissagree, but on the whole I found the charachter descriptions to be very well written and useful.The only major flaws I found were the lack of markings on some of the maps which gets confusing, but the weapon appendix and spell appendix was way better than I could've hoped for. I also plan on getting the world builders guide, and I can only hope that is's half as good as the adventure guide. :-)"
1,waste of money,title says it all. Might be slightly helpfull in finding where things are but the maps being unmarked on some pages kind of negats that.To many errors in the book.
3,It's OK,"I like how small the meter is, but the kit with everything included is actually bigger and bulkier than the others I have used, which defeats the purpose of getting a smaller meter. Other than the kit size, the meter is great!"
3,Be Cautious of the Title,"I purchased this book because I was looking for an in-depth study of Ethiopian culture, both past and present. However, it soon became apparent that the book's subtitle ""A Cultural and Historical Guide"" was somewhat misleading. Rather, Mr. Munro-Hay provides a detailed and scholarly analysis of Ethiopian historical sites. The publisher would have been well-advised to use the subtitle ""An Archaeological Survey"" instead. If that is what you're looking for, then this book is ideal. But if you want information on contemporary Ethiopian culture, it would be best to look elsewhere."
5,Read it before your go to visit this beautiful country,"We know very little about this country, this ex-Abyssinia that has remained estranged from the outside world for a long time.Read this book to learn really a lot about this only country in Africa that did not get colonized. Its history is more than rich, amazing and surprising. The people are marvellous."
5,Bruce Wacker is the renewed classic rocker!,I love classic rock and I was so excited to hear this band with a guitarist who i compare to the great ones of the 70's. Bruce Wacker is the best rock and roll i have heard in a while!
1,Will never buy it again!,"I am usually quite pleased with Biosilk products, but not this time...again! This product is actually greasy and doesn't do what I expected it to do...hated it!"
3,Just Okay,"This book was ""just okay"". It was chockful of simple food items that I would not serve to guests that I am trying to impress at a dinner party. Boiled red potatoes with parsley....I don't think so....Not interesting enough for me, nothing in this book catches the eye....if you want extreme simple this is the book for you. Another dud...."
1,Contradictory text beginning in Chapter One.,"I just finished reading Chapter1 and have put this book down. Chapter1 has enough contadictory text that I question the integrity of the remaining material in the book. Even in the test portion of Chapter1, an answer does not agree with a subject that is reinforced twice in the text. I'm disappointed considering the credentials of the author.Shawn Downs CNE, CNE3, CNE4, MCSE"
4,More than it seems...and the price is right,"When you consider how much blank books are going for these days, this book is a bargain even though it's paperback. It has a page for every tarot card, with a brief meaning, and plenty of blank space where you can write your own personal notes about what that card means to you.In addition, though the blurb doesn't even mention this, it comes with a miniature version of the ""Tarot Nova"" in cardboard, which you can ""tear along the dotted lines"" and then you have a little tarot deck. It's quite small, so it might not be of much use except as a conversation piece. Or, you could get a box/pouch/etc. and carry this deck in your purse in case you feel the urge to do a spur-of-the-moment reading in the coffee shop."
1,CRAP,"Way too bulky and big, it blocks the license plate illumination light and the picture quality is terrible and it is useless at night. GARBAGE."
3,"Nice, but HUGE","Bought this watch on overstock.com. it is a HUGE watch, but that is what I like about it, it stands out. It was even confused for an even more expensive brand by someone who so it! I give it a three because I had to return it for another one because the band broke off and now my second one broke off on the some spot."
5,Good Album,"I was in the mood to branch out and try some different ""off the beaten path"" music that had catchy female vocals and bought this CD based on the recommendations here.I'm quite pleased with the quality of this album. Production qualities are top notch, most of the songs have a haunting somberness with strong, ringing vocals from the duets female vocalist. The remix CD (2nd disc included) nicely balances this out with jazzed up remixes of several of the tracks on the first CD.It is apparent that Hungry Lucy is a pretty underrated band and will only get better with subsequent releases.If you're looking for something different, something that is both relaxing and catchy to listen to, then this CD might be a good choice for you."
1,Glo,"I just went for it and bought the CD but I'm not really impressed, not that she doesn't have talent...it's just not a very good album. She could do better."
4,response,"I just read this book for my WGST 340 class and very much enjoyed it. The book was not only entertaining but also insightful. Weems interpreted Bible stories in a way I could never image up on my own, but makes so much sense after reading. She brought to light women's issues as well as provided explanations I have never really thought about before. This book definitely made me think and search within myself on my own perspectives and as well as enlightened me with her own. I would recommend this book for women of all ages and backgrounds."
3,learner,"The material of the book is not very durable. Even the cover gets wrinkled easily. The content is ok, with easy to understand radical explaination."
3,"Very deep, not for the novice","It is a good book, but it takes a long time to figure out what they are talking about. Don't get me wrong, it is a valid piece, but it is for someone who is already familiar with the Chinese internal arts. Not a price but for your money, you might want to go with something else."
1,Misleading and disappointing!,"The title of this book is misleading to say the least! Regarding the history, well traditional chinese martial arts history is confusing and this is just adding to that confusion. The book lists no biography or sources for that matter. I would not recommend this book to anyone, you are simply wasting your money. It glosses over basics, for example in Xing Yi Quan the author does not even mention, let alone explain the basic stance.The applications and photos are laughable. This book is geared and catered to westerners who know nothing and have no real understanding of real traditional chinese martial arts. I cannot agree with the other reviewers. I live in Beijing and have been studying Baguazhang, this book is not worth the paper it is printed on. If you want to know about real traditional chinese martial arts then you really do have to come to China!"
1,Very disappointed,"We had this toy for 5 minutes before it broke. The retractable string came unattached from the ring that attaches to spiderman's wrist. Therefore, the string retracted all of the way back inside the base unit never to be seen again. He cannot perform his ""Web-climbing action"" without the string."
3,satisfactory,"Generally speaking the book contains a great deal of historical biblical informations and is to some degree an assest to bible study. However, the overall flavor of this book seems not to be faith based. The perspective approach is a scholarly one but at times lacks a critical ingredient for believers. Small matters of disagreement between historians (such as whether the book Matthew or Mark was written first)seem to indicate that much of the writing is from a historians viewpoint vs that of a believer."
5,Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible,"I purchased it for an incarcerated felon at the Christian Prison in Richmond, TX. The Chuck Colson Prison Fellowship Ministries 18 month pre-pelease program of ""Inner-Change Freedom Initiative (IFI)"" is conducted at the Carol Vance (Jester 3) Unit of TDCJ. I mentor ex-offenders prior to release and 6 months after. He says: ""I use it daily""."
3,Quite effective as erotica,"I've been searching for some mild but interesting erotica. And this is one of the best I've found. Admittedly it doesn't have, and wasn't intended to have, plot, deep or continuing characters or long passages. But a collection of letters that describe what people consider the best about sex has to have something to interest anyone."
4,I do a lot of clipping.,"So far ( one month) they are very sharp and a pleasure to use. Just yesterday though they started sticking--I had to physically open them after a clip, if that makes sense. I sprayed with silicone last night. Hope to have them back in top shape."
1,damage box torn and smell of oil.,this is my second pair of shears.the first shippment i receive a empty box no shears in box.this time i receive the box damage and torn and the shears smell like oil.very disappointed with this vendor.
3,"It's a cradle that can sync a charge, even with some difficulty.","It syncs, it charges, and FAST!I had two beefs with this thing and that cost it 1 star each. First was the fact that it doesn't have a splitter for power and USB connection. You have to actually unplug the USB when you want to plug in DC. Still though, you can charge through the USB it is just painfully slow.Also a little button was very poorly glued on the back and has since fallen out. I have no idea what it's purpose is."
4,"Good Product, Fast Delivery, Average Value","Pros:1. Works as advertised. Syncs & charges.2. LED's to indicate charging/docking status.2. Small, lightweight, yet sturdy and somewhat durable.3. HTC 8525 & OEM battery both fit nicely and securely.4. Delivered one day earlier than expected via DHL & USPS.Cons:1. USB cable is built-in and permanantly attached to the device meaning that it can't be removed or easily replaced if it were to fail.2. AC adaptor cable is shorter than desired. (Cable is approx. 3 feet in length)3. Although product was not damaged in shipping, I felt the packaging could have been a bit better. It was basically the cheapest paper box inside of the cheapest plastic bag. The box was substantially crushed by the time I received it, however the product fortunately somehow survived.4. LED's are quite bright. Black Sharpie did the trick for me."
2,not very good,"Even though this is a toy, it should atleast be somewhat functional. It is extremely hard to get a decent sound out of this without constant squealing. I wouldn't buy another."
1,Broke soon,Piece of plastic near mouth piece broke within 3 days and rendered it useless. Did not sound good to begin with but didn't last long.
2,A lightweight,"I bought this for my husband and was hoping the ""one size"" would be big enough as he usually wears a XL. After washing there are snags and loose threads all over it. I did not dry it in the dryer fearing it would shrink even more. This robe is no bargain. It looks cheap and feels cheap."
1,Very disappointed!!,"I ordered these robes for us for the Jacuzzi in the winter. The robes came without the HOOD that was supposed to be the item...and it looks cheaply made! I spent $20 for shipping also, waste of money!!"
1,Print Server -- NOT,"This thing is a piece of junk. Won't talk to HP USB printers, shows OFF line in utility software, yet the printer as online.. basically, a great idea, poorly executed.Save your money until they get it working."
2,"It kind of works, with RUDE tech support","I was looking for something to share my Hp laser jet 1220 and decided to try this gadget. It says that it does not support multi-function printer, but all I want it to do is to print anyway. After 2 hours of fiddling with it, I got it to work. Here are the tricks.1. Use Internet printing protocol (I have Win2000)2. Use USB port instead of parallel port. For some reason, it just wouldn't work with the parallel port even though the server admin software sees the printer on parallel port. Thank goodness my printer also has a usb port.3. use static ip address4. Use http://server ip address here/lp2 or lp3 for usb ports.By the way, don't bother calling tech support. Very RUDE!"
2,Would be great if it worked!,"I bought this print server to use with my macintosh system. The box said it was compatible with OSX. Well--many hours and several calls to tech support and a visit to CompUSA's Apple Store later, the thing still doesn't work. The documentation is in a word, scanty. The instructions for Mac users presume a knowledge base which is not common in the average Mac user. I spent two hours at the CompUSA Apple store working with the Apple professional trying to get the thing to work. The setup requires typing into the Unix terminal--not something most Mac users feel comfortable with. Even the Hawking tech support guy said my unit must be broken--but another unit we opened at CompUSA didn't work either. So...I will probably return this item, although I really don't want to--there isn't anything else like it on the market. That's why I give it two stars instead of one--because apparently some people have gotten it to work, and it is a nicely priced, unique bit of hardware. Sigh."
1,Does NOT work with multfunction printers,"This print server is a great idea, and if it worked with multifunction printers (like my Canon F80) I would have given it 4 stars because installation was easy. I called the company, and they were very clear that this print server DOES NOT SUPPORT MULTIFUNCTION PRINTERS. So if you have a combination printer/fax/scanner, forget it."
1,War is Fun!,"Alright, it's obvious this pinhead didn't serve in any war,therefore he is free to jingle around with American jingoism.He seems not to understand as our imperial ambitions grow, that the jolly ol' oligarchy at home will continue to grow smaller in size and larger in it's secretive, and lucrative grasps...Coming from the Atlantic monthly, along with Kaplan and the like,it's obvious where he wants America to manifest it's destiny."
1,O'Rourke conservative humorist?,Is this the best the right has to offer when it comes to humor?No wonder the best comedians are always liberals.
2,Shtick,"A liberal goes to war and brings back horrific images of carnage and suffering. A conservative goes to war and brings back - images of bureaucratic ineptitude and ugly overstuffed couches. That's P.J. for you. This collection quickly gets tiresome, supercilious, and condescending. I'm not a conservative, but I have enjoyed P.J. before as a good writer, wickedly observant and self-aware. This ain't it, though.Jaklak sez check it out if you're a member of the choir and want to be preached to. Otherwise, keep walking."
2,Disappointing,"I'd found 'Give War a Chance', 'Holiday's in Hell' and 'Eat the Rich' works of genius. Compared to his older work, this one is just sad. If you have any awareness of current events, then don't buy this book."
1,Peace Kills,"O'Rouke is a cigar smoking alcoholic who types his manuscripts on an IBM Selectric. He is yesterdays news. His cheap shots and grade school level analysis of current events indicate an individual who has stopped in time (circa the 1950's one guesses). Peace Kills is an awful, rambling collection of unimportant observations (""the unspellables killing the unpronouncables"" written by an ignorant bigot who, because he can't spell or pronounce the names, thinks that they are of worthless inferiors). O'Rourke is a typical Midwest, clodhopping ignoramous who thinks he is God's answer to America's moral and political problems. Well, he is not. His observations and respective judgments are jejune (probably because his brain is atrophied from the tobacco carcinogens and the neurotoxins in the booze) appealing to intellectually insipid adolescents and intellectually and morally shallow imbeciles who claim to be ""libertarians."" This book is a waste of any decent human beings time."
2,Supercilious and glib,"I've enjoyed hearing PJ on NPR, but was sorely disappointed by his writings in this book. Certainly learning about the history of conflicts and cultures was interesting (hence 2 stars and not 1) but mostly I was aghast at how flip and superior he comes across.His Nobel chapter was stunningly facile and arrogant; sadly devoid of the constructive and witty commentary I was expecting when I bought the book.If you consider amusing or insightful the suggestion that the malnourished poor of the world ""go get a job"", you may nevertheless find this book worthwhile."
2,Boredom Kills: PJ's Sad New Recycle Fodder,"To borrow a riff from PJ, if this is literature, I'd hate to see what drivel looks like... I've always enjoyed PJ's hilarious rants as he skewered stupidity and political correctness, while keeping his political beliefs (for the most part) under the hood, where they rightly belonged.Sadly, in this case, the dual curse of flat humor laced with bitterness and the burden of a lost political cause (the defense of Dubya) combine to transform this from ""must buy"" to ""pick it up when you please because it will languish on the library shelves"".I had to force myself to finish this, and will say that the final postscript was the best part of the whole."
4,I love PJ's wit...,"But this book wanders, fun as it is to read. I keep looking for a MESSAGE. I liked the ""Eat the Rich"" which did have a conclusion and a message of sorts. AS with his writings in Atlantic and I am a bit disappointed that PJ is no longer ""sharp"". He moves aimlessly, like a man who is fat, dumb and happy with cheap barbs. I think he could make it more meaningful, old as he is now. Perhaps we should expect a bit more depth, although in most of his book lately depth is on a holiday.Ok, I am a fan, despite the fact this book so far is not hitting the spot for me."
1,Meandering travel diary?,"A friend of the family gave us ""Peace Kills"". I was excited to read it, because I had heard good things about PJ.I found the book very disorganized, unless it was supposed to be a travel diary. As a travel diary, the books is fine, as he writes about what he saw and heard and experienced during his travels. I did not find that he had any insights or profound observations, nor did he have any particular point of view.Unfortunately, I would have to say that it was kind of like attending the lecture of an incompetent and older college professor who talks on and on without ever getting to the point. I still have no idea what the point is of the title. It is a compelling title, but there's nothing in the book that supports the title.Reading this book was kind of like watching some dumb sitcom on television; it passes the time, you are mildly distracted, but a few days later, you cannot remember a thing about it."
3,Not His Best,"In this collection of essays, O'Rourke recounts his travels to such places as Iraq, Israel, and Egypt. As usual, he writes with a smirk and makes more than a few political jabs, but overall, this book is not as funny as most of O'Rourke's works. Probably the most entertaining essay is on the eclectic and often unintentionally ironic Washington, D.C. demonstrations. Overall, however, the book did not deliver the kind of high quality satire I have come to expect from O'Rourke. It was a quick and amusing read, to be sure, but it was one of his lesser books."
4,Peace kills is funny,"Mr. O'Rourke is recognized as a conservative who hangs about with people of a type I find tiresome, politicians. The conservative Cato Institute publishes some of his books.This author sometimes advances ideas that are wrong and meanspirited, sort of.But he is also very funny and his mockery of tragic events sometimes has a valid point. What do we do about about many world problems? The answer sometimes is nothing because nothing we are likely to do will help.Would that he was able to appropriately mock the people who have successfully broken a working country, our own, and taken it budget surpluses to an unending string of deficits that will only grow -- even with Bushian fuzzy math.But read this and his work in magazines. He's very funny and sometimes his observations are so acute it hurts. A conservative with a genuine sense of humor? Can't be possible but it is. Here at least he mocks the new imperialism that has cost so many lives."
2,When does Classic =cliche,"Have loved PJO since ""RPR"" was published in the 1989 but he is starting to become predictable . This will be the last PJ book I purchase without having a review of the contents first . A sad day , as the arrival of a new PJ O'rourke was something to relish ."
2,Major Disappointment,"It's so difficult to find a decent play mat for a baby, for some reason, and I searched and searched for a foam mat until I found this one, which seemed perfect. But it was a disappointment. For this much money and for the length of time I had to wait for it (some weeks), I expected to be thrilled, frankly. The mat reeks of chemicals (gets better over time, but I was taken aback at first); the animals are a bit odd-looking (one of them is still unidentifiable to me); and most important, the mat is too thin! If you place it on a hardwood floor and sit on it, your [...] will hurt. It looks like it'd be thick, but it's not--and I fear that my baby will topple over and hurt her head."
2,Poor grammer/punctuation use.,"This book is great as a beginning reader book, in that the words are easier, but the sentence construction is HORRIBLE. Often the sentences are started with and or but when it is NOT needed. For example... ""I see a new Mega-Star Spaceship. It glows in the dark. And it flies. But that is not for me."" It should be written... I see a new Mega-Star Spaceship. It glows in the dark and it flies, but that is not for me. I am in no way an expert at the English language, but come on!"
5,A modern picaro,"Chaim Bertman's first novel allows us to truly get inside the head and heart of a deperately struggling writer who is passionate about his art. His courships and relationships with many women in six different locales skillfully create a unique ethos for each location. At the same time Eric engages life as a modern picaro eventually arriving in San Francisco where he will meet the editor(with whom he plays a weekly game of chess) who will bring his novel to fruition. Strong, intelligent writing throughout, but in the San Francisco segment the author's voice is exceptional."
1,History as He Does Not Know It,"The concept of extinction did not exist until the nineteenth century. Until then there was no sense that species evolved, lived for a time, and then went extinct. Because religion still held sway over so much of the world, there was a sense that everything God had ever created would still be found - somewhere.- Peter Ward ""Life as We Do Not Know It""""Thirdly, That there may have been divers Species of things wholly destroyed and annihilated, and divers others changed and varied, for since we find that there are some kinds of Animals and Vegetables peculiar to certain places, and not to be found elsewhere; if such a place have been swallowed up, 'tis not improbable that those Animal Beings may have been destroyed with them; and this may be true both of aerial and aquatick Animals:...""- Robert Hooke, Discourse on Earthquakes, 1667"
2,"Worth a read, but from a library","I have mixed feelings about this book, as do a couple other people. On the plus side, I think Ward does bring to the lay public an interesting subject that for the most part is explained fairly well. Moreover, I like his attempt at making more general biological classifications beyond the Life We Do Know. On the negative side, however, I do agree that his lack of documentation is frustrating, his style is too breezy, and his organization could have been improved just a tad. This book is definitely worth a read, but I don't know that I'd be willing to pay the price for such a thin (in more ways than one) volume. And, in fact, I didn't; I checked it out from a library and I suggest you do as well. Meanwhile, I would normally give this book three or four stars, but I'm giving it only two as a protest against the author's unethical act of reviewing and rating his own work! Boo! Hiss! Just take it like a man, good and bad."
4,Firm grasp,"I know nothing about Walter's previous bands. I mean NOTHING! Meet Mr. Clueless. Maybe that helped since I had no expecations when a friend handed me this recording. All I can say is that it's one heck of a good rock project. The vocals remind me of Sondre Lerche, but the whole affair rocks along with catchy punch. Strongly suggested for people who are into bands like the New Pornographers... basic rock that is anything but bland."
3,good but not the best,I saw these guys live in concert last night. They were pretty good. Interesting songs titles and good music. I especially like the bassist. He had great bass lines and the energy of the band was overall good. Good. But not the best. They are just an average band from New york but I wish them luck.
5,Wow.,"I just got this CD in the mail -- bought for a friend who is a new citizen. Thought I'd give it a listen first. Wow. I own a fair amount of 18th century popular and choral music, and a few Boston Camerata discs. This beauty is going straight to the top of my list of favorites. Lovely, very musical. I agree with the previous review that this disc captures the history, but I want to recommend the recordings as music, too."
4,Good Overview,"A decent overview of SK's work; limited, however, by the scope of the undertaking. Worth reading, however, if you are a Kierkegaardian neophyte (in fact, perhaps one of the best small, quick reads about themes SK was engaged in throughout his mutlifarious and sometimes complicated career as an author for ""that solitary individual."") Recommended!"
1,Where's the fireplace?,"This isn't a fireplace. It is two charred logs with a feeble flame visible between them. The colors are highly muted as well. There is no stack of logs, roaring fire, and brick in the background. This is like staring into the center of a camp fire and tuning everything around it out; if you're colorblind anyways."
5,Sad and moving yet entertaining.,"I was a fan of Rick Nelson's and though it was hard to read parts of this book, Joe Selvin provided an insight to Nelson's life."
5,Only when the truth is told can we fully understand.,"Despite the remarks in the above reviews concerning Joel Selvin taking a negative position concerning some aspects of Rick's life, I find this book to be a TOTALY unbiased examination of one of the most interesting lives of our times. Mr. Selvin cuts to the chase in his effort to seek the truth and follow it where ever it may lead. I had the honor of being co-president of Rick's national fan club during the mid 70's and I knew many of the people aluded to in this book. I can say with only one exception that Joels appraisal of these people is right on the mark. Remember, the function of any biography is to show a true picture of a subject's life. Joel Selvin has accomplished this in a most artful way. His very readable biography can at times be disturbing to those who resist seeing this most talented rock star as he was. Joel Selvin, I salute you!"
5,Fannie Farmer Cook Book,Love this cook book- had a very old copy from my mother and it finally fell apart- had to have a new copy!! I recommend this book to all cooks young and old.
3,Fannie Farmer 1896 Cook Book,"I was trying to replace a tattered copy that was missing its cover and publication date. I knew my copy was an early edition, but not which one. Unfortunately, there were a lot of available early editions to choose from, and I chose wrong: This one was not the edition I was looking for, which is unfortunate, because the specific recipes I was looking for aren't in it.That said, the book is a fascinating historical artefact - and one that makes me eternally grateful I don't have to live in 1896."
3,Interesting reading,"For me this ""Fanny Farmer Cookbook 1896"" an interesting reading into the ways of doing things over 100 years ago. It is not in my opinion, a Cookbook for someone starting out as a newbie- there are far better ones out there for that such as the ""Betty Croker Big Red Book 2012"".This original Fanny farmer is very outdated and some of the ""Recipes for Health"" are downright dangerous according to today's knowledge and standards. It does however make an interesting read into the past and a good standard for how far we have come. Perhaps one the updated versions of this Book will serve better for today's cooks, but I have had no experience with any of those as of yet.So, I'd have to say that this is not really a COOKBOOK for Today's needs but a great History of where were once were.Fanny Farmer deserves respect for all her hard work, dedication and inventivness but I must give it a 3 Star rating as it does not relate to today's methods well at all.Thank you."
1,Not my kind of cook book,"""cooking a calf's head""? Ugh!! I think I'll pass. Someone please tell me people didn't actually eat that in 1896."
3,Lenses are poor quality,The two lenses are worthless. The 2x lens has a bad fish eye effect and the .5 lens had a shadow on the bottom of the picture. I would look for a kit that doesn't include the lenses because they are very poor quality. Everything elses is good.
1,Not for large laptops,"I have a 17"" Asus G73jh series Gaming Laptop. This lap desk is advertised as compatible with 17"" laptops, but it is way too small to work properly. It is also flimsy and I feel if I were to accidentally press down on my mouse too hard, the hinge would break on the mouse-pad.All in all, a poor product for larger laptops. It might be fine for a small 15"" laptop with a micro mouse, but the manufacturer is stretching the bounds of reality in advertising this as a product compatible with 17"" laptops."
5,perfect for laptop,excellent addition for anyone who has a laptop and mouse and needs a mouse pad and to keep the computer cool. great price too!
4,Excellet for couch laptoping,"This is perfect for working on my laptop on the couch. The only problem I have with it is the mouse slides off sometimes, some grippy material around the edge of the mousepad would make it perfect."
5,does what it's supposed to,"This is the cheapest hub that I could find to expand the ethernet in my house. It is a great way to expand your broadband connection inside of a home office or room that has multiple computers that need internet access.Just hook up your broadband connection to the back, connect up to 5 computers, plug the hub in, and youre set.(note: this doesn't function as a router, so if you hook up your dsl modem directly i don't know if you'll be able to log in to your service. you would be best off getting a broadband router and expanding on the existing internet connected lan with this hub)"
5,Dawsons Creek,"This song is so dawsons creek, like how joey and dawson are such good friends, andthe love each other so much and i like cry when i think of this song and dawsons creek! dont forget to watch it on the WB wednesday nights at 8:00 est. its really good, and cool!"
5,Finally something refreshing and wonderful !!!!!,"In my opinion, Edwin McCain is one of the greatest musicians I've heard in a while. I think his music and his songs are extraordinary. It's like a mix of good old rock n' roll with blues, folk and a bit of jazz. I actually like Honor Among Thieves best. My favorite song is Gueneviere. It shows how soulful and romantic Edwin must me. The title song is great too. Misguided Roses has a differnt feel to it, but the music is still great. My favorite besides ""I'll Be"" is ""Rhythem of Life"". I just wish Edwin would get more recognition on TV and on the radio, not because his song was on Dawson's Creek but because he is a beautiful man who sings and writes beautiful songs. I think he deserves more credit and we as his fans should do something to help him out.Can't wait for the next masterpiece !!!!"
5,Ah the good old days,"Amazing how far computers have come since my old C64 was classified as a powerful machine graphically. I love the new stuff, but once in awhile its nice to backtrack to the good ol days of 64k memory and 5 1/4"" disk drives. I agree with the review about the difficulty of the games, but its just once again a reminder of the changes in gaming with the times. My old C64 eventually burnt up with use, and its nice to see I'm not the only one to miss these game treasures included on this wonderful piece of equipment. Now, if only somebody would do this with an apple II...."
3,Great nastagia,"This product is an awesome look back at early gaming, the unfortunate part of it is no saves."
2,could be better,"Not as much fun as I remember. Maybe better if they had a better selection of games (One on One, Hardball, etc.)"
2,A bargain in disappointment,"I purchased this product for my niece,having had positive experiences with similar items,and finding the price to be too tempting.However,what had been the hope of introducing her to the videogames of my generation turned into an exercise in frustration from the outset.The screw to the battery casing stripped with very little application of a screwdriver,the titles suffered from redundancy,and many of them required the use of too many buttons.What was the most disappointing aspect of this item was the potential it possessed; perhaps fewer similar titles and a re-configuration of the button commands would ensure the promise of this product."
4,it's good by:jordan,it's good. it isn't special to a kid like me. if your an oldy fine this is for you. if your new just get a gamesystem. i reccomend the sega plug in and play because of graphics and much better games.I like cyberdyne warrior. That consist of shooting alien creatures and catching the robots. this game is a classic. I don't think you ever run out of ammo so it's pointless to get it when you bring back the robot to the ship. anyway not a 30 games are good such as bull riding. only 10 games are good if your new.
1,It's seems great....until you realize the joystick doesnt work!,"I was really excited when I saw this item was out! I had the Commodore 64 when I was a kid, and my brother and I used to spend hours and hours playing games on it. I was so glad to see that Winter Games and Summer Games was included.... until the item arrived and I plugged it in and tried to play with it.. the joystick doesn't work at ALL when you move it to the right. So, you can only use it to go up down or left.BIG Dissapointment. Don't waste your $$."
3,Anatomical Atlas,"This is indeed an atlas, containing pictures only. These are in two categories.1) Color pictures of end grain at 6,5x magnification: of this kind there are 1284 pictures at a size of 4,0 by 4,4cm.2) The second category is of black&white microphotographs. Four per entry: a cross, a tangential and a radial section at 25x magnification and a radial section at 100x focused on ray-vessel pits. The micrographs are at a size of ca 4,0 by 5,5cm. There are 1605 such entries of four micrographs each.This Atlas is a compromise in many respects, containing very many pictures in a single book. The pictures indeed are a bit crowded together and indeed are a bit small, especially since these are halftones.Also the book is distinctly biased towards woods from (the vicinity of) Australia. For those whose interest is restricted to the more common hardwoods only there are better books on the market. However in the right place and at the right time this Atlas may prove an invaluable reference."
5,Chitty Chitty Bang Bang!,This movie truly rates all 5 stars with me. I thoroughly enjoy this excellent print! It is all the vendor said it is. I recommend it to the whole family!
5,love them,"Awesome towels, pretty and very absorbent. I've purchased probably 6 or 8 sets of these over the last couple years.Be cautious, some of the towels are slightly smaller in size but priced the same. I believe these are the smaller ones."
1,Dissatisfied customer,"Homeland Security 4 Color Camera SystemI purchased 2 of these systems. I now have 4 bad cameras and cannot get a hold of the company that manufactured them. Nowhere on the box does it give a phone number, address, or email to get warranty replacement.While I do agree that they were pretty simple to install, where is the support once you have purchased this item."
4,Great deal on Color security cameras,"I have to say, I got excellent deal on this system. Great picture, brilliant color, and easy to install"
5,PetAg Kitten replacement milk,I took in a stray mama cat and her 7 kittens. The babies would fight like crazy to nurse off of mama and some would be left out. I started feeding the KMR replacer milk to all of them. Even the runt filled out. They sure like it. Mama likes it too. She's still a kitten herself. They have been drinking it on their own for many weeks now and they are all fat and healthy.
1,Nothing like the great Sanskrit-English work!,"About 3/4 the size of the Skt-Eng tome, this book is very frustrating, because it spews out a deluge of Sanskrit words for each English entry without any attempt at explaining shades of meaning, or ANY meaning. Add to that the fact that the Sanskrit is not romanized at any point, and that some of the characters are smudged and illegible. I couldn't even call this a work in progress. It is a tedious, useless, vocabulary list."
1,ratchet wrench,"This tool is cheap....you get what you pay for, it's loose, difficult to change the direction of the ratchet, I wasted my money, I'll use it for something but not working on my car....maybe a fishing sinker"
5,It's not Christmas until we play FIRST SNOW by Gary Jess,We bought this a few Years ago and it has become one of our favorite Christmas traditions to start the season with this CD. It sounds traditional and yet fresh.
3,The Cheerleader~,"""She was a nobody. Alone and ignored. She wanted what they had. Althea wanted to be a Cheerleader. Which meant popularity. To be noticed, to have friends, and possibly a boyfriend. She would do anything it takes..""I thought it was ok, the whole high school cliche seems to be overly done in this though.. Like I don't think it's like this anymore in high school, but I could be wrong ;)The ending was nice, but it could have tied up some lose ends. Overall it was ok."
4,The Cheerleader,"This book kept me on the edge of my seat, but did not make it so I could not go to sleep. Althea is just a girl who is never noticed. When she makes a deal with a vampire she is instantly popular, she also makes the cheerleading squad, to replace the girl she gave to the vampire. She thought it would end there but now the vampire wants another victim. Who will she give and when will it end? As the the story goes on Althea realises that she has to do the vapires every wim. Is it really more the vamires falt than hers? If she had never started it, she wouldn`t have to stop it now."
5,"Fifteen Years Later, Still Great.","I read this book many years ago, and I still think about it from time to time. It features a creepy, well-crafted story that both teens and adults can appreciate. Whenever I pull ""The Cheerleader"" out to re-read it, I'm immersed in the storyline just as much as I was the first time I read it. I highly recommend it!"
4,Good enough for me,The only thing wrong with mine is that I can't get it to zero out. So my measurements start at 1 lb. with the bowl empty. I just subtract a pound from the total.
1,product bites,Got the scale and it looked pretty nice but it wouldn't zero so I sent it back for a refund.It was refunded quickly bit was charged 3 bucks for the return.
4,"1st Place For This ""Run""","The rollicking, surviving tenor saxophonist of the Charlie Hunter Quartet, Ellis proves he has plenty of ideas on his second solo record. The bright, playful sounds he brought to the Quartet are all here, along with a solid grasp of arrangements. Ellis is in excellent company with a powerhouse of a group that includes Dmitri Metheny on flugelhorn."
2,Incomplete Package,"The book has some good pointers...here's the problem, I guess this is supposed to be sold with some audio recordings, which are not included in this version. The book is simply incomplete without them. So don't bother buying this version make sure you get the one that comes with the tapes that are oftem referenced in the text."
2,too cursory,"I felt this book was a too cursory introduction. A few good exercises, but i think this is a topic that just doesn't lend itself to a teach yourself approach. I am giving it 2 stars for a couple of great pieces of advice, but i would advice you to try something else first."
2,Mystrey theater material,"Running out of things to watch.. this is b- good story line , less than good acting. Hey free is a good price and not a total waste."
1,Waste of money,"I noticed that I really have to be careful with foreign films, this one I would say is a ""D"", at least I was able to trade it in and get something back for it."
1,Appears to be a school project,"It isn't really a movie. Rather, it appears to be friends/family/schoolmates that got together to do a film while learning how to use the equipment. I sort of expected something like that - but really, it is even worse than you expect. Don't rent this and encourage more people to put similar kinds of junk up."
5,A great story,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel. I have been to Galveston many times and one of the most striking aspects of this book is the portrayal of the island -- from its glory to its corruption. The characters are not idealized as is often the case in similar books, but rather Mr. Leavenworth writes about real people struggling with real issues. The fact that this is based on a true story only adds chill to an already suspenseful read. I would recommend this book to anyone -- especially those planning a trip to Galveston. On second thought, maybe you should read it after you get back from Galveston!"
3,A knowledge bank for injection mold designers,this is a book to pick up ideas on designing a variety of injection molds. almost all possible ideas and configurations are covered in the book.the mold designs are elaborately detailed with a short write-up explaining the salient working features.a companion cd with an animation of the working of the mold would have been a welcome addition but overall the book is very useful for the experienced mold designer.
3,"Kind of creepy, like a child porn book in disguise...","This book started out with one solid storyline, but by the end it had totally gone in another direction. This book felt to me like it was a child pornography book. The begining was really interesting, but by the end it was weak and disgusting."
2,Amateur,The author falls into the usual mistake of Caucasus writers: he believes in the mythology of the noble mountain warrior. His search for the fantoms of Imam Shamil is pretty shallow and amateur. The reader would probably want to go for real fiction instead and buy Leslie Blanch's Sabres of Paradise. For those who want something serious (more than the boring ride of a young hype journalist in a decrepit Zhigouli across the Caucasus) go for Yo'av Karny's Highlanders.
4,Chimp 72% is very good,"This is a very good dark chocolate...I like mine dark, but with a little sweetness. The 88% is too dark for my taste, and the 72% a tad too sweet.. I like to chop them both up together and mix them with raw nuts and dried cranberries. I wished they made something in the middle...say 77- 80% I think that would be the perfect sugar/choco combo. I like the ethics of the company as well."
5,Easily the best dark chocolate I've ever eaten,"There's not even an argument here. I've eaten pretty much every organic dark chocolate bar on the market. Even some of those insanely priced Raw Food ones, at $9 per bar. This is FAR AND AWAY the best tasting, best quality bar I've eaten. It's so amazingly delicious, and makes me feel good too.The price listed on here isn't that great, however. I get these in Stop N' Shop (NY Grocery Store Chain) for 2 for $5. A pack of 12 would be $30 and I don't have to pay for shipping, so I end up getting a better deal. Amazon usually has the best deals ever, but not so for these chocolate bars. Even though I'm not buying them on here, I'm still buying them regularly!Amazing chocolate. Do yourself a favor and buy CASES of these if you can't find them in any store around you!"
4,Samurai X,"Samurai X or as I call it, Rurouni Kenshin is a great movie. I would give it 5 stars but because this movie was kinda sad. If u watched this movie and liked it, I bet u would get hooked on the T.V seires. And even though u didn't like it, I recommend u watch the T.V seires."
3,Don't get fooled like I did,"The product itself may be good (I haven't tried it since it is a gift). However, the description says it is 4 oz. when in fact the product you get is only 2.56 oz. I paid more in shipping and handling than the actual cost of the item, yet it weighed less than advertised."
4,Great Read for Marketing and Advertising,"This book is an excellent source for understanding Advertising from A to Z. This book teaches all the necessary elements for developing a successful advertising campaign, creating the plansbook, and then winning the client's business. It gives great examples, it easy to read, as well as, thought provoking. It is truly a great guide to Marketing Commuincation Plans. It is used in Clark Atlanta's MBA Program for Advertising and Promotion. It's definitely ""On Point!"""
2,Dry as Toast,I am using this text for an intermediate-level advertising course and it is so incredibly tedious I think I might die. For every point there are endless paragraphs of explanations but very few examples. This leaves the reader feeling like he or she is reading a technical manual. I would not recommend this for any course unless the instructor was going to supplement with valuable lectures to illustrate this dry and dull text.
4,This Book,"This book was fairly expensive, but was very helpful toward the campaign project I had to use it for. It helped organize my group and I was the only one who had it, so we referred to it a lot. I would definitely recommend it to anyone that needed it for a campaigns class or just wants to know the process of organizing a campaign in advertising."
5,Very well done,"If there is one good thing about the 3.5 DMG, it is that it gave more room for other stuff in this book about planar travel.The old Lady of Pain and her town of Sigil is back in a big way. However, Sigil itself is only a few pages in this tome. Included are new prestige class, some of which were already in Dragon (Athar and Fated) but the Sensates is a total rewrite. I also liked how they did the City of Brass. The typical ""crunchy bits"" are all there as well.Trust me, you want this one."
2,"WTF? MOTP (a better book) has 224 pages, this has 192. What gives?","It's newer and 3.5 i guess. A ""player's handbook to the planes"". Lame. If WOTC are going to rape the collectors and completests, why not give 'em more bang, more quality and more quantity. Merge the MOTP with this book, give us 450 pages and charge the same price. The 2004 ""Expanded Psionics"" book gave you +64 pages (224 total) over the 2001 ""Psionics Handbook"". It's rape, but at least they gave you more. In April 2006 they're coming out with yet another Psionics book with only 160 pages (with the most poorly named title ever) called ""Complete Psionic"" -- which is meant to ""complement"" the Psionics Handbook. Well, if it's meant to ""COMPLEMENT"" the other friggin' book it's harldy ""COMPLETE"" now is it!!!"
2,Some things need not be resurrected,"The D&D; planes system makes almost no sense at all. I mean, I can't even begin to understand it.This book is an excellent introduction/reference guide to something I'd never include, even vaguely, in any of my campaigns. While some of the imagery and ideas are useful, the system as a whole is poor. 3rd edition should have revised it, thouroughly or left it alone."
1,DO NOT WASTE 90+ minutes of your life on this,"I don't even know what I just watched. From what I could gather, this is a documentary about an obviously disturbed social outcast. There is virtually NOTHING about aliens or UFO's even mentioned.At first I thought I might appreciate his sense of humor, but then it promptly took a wrong turn. This was a complete and utter waste of time and NO ONE should buy or watch this movie, EVER."
4,Got better the more I read!,At first I thought this book was a little slow and not interesting since it was from the writers point of view but after reading several pages I fell in love with this book. I really enjoyed the information about what was written contrasted with what was actually filmed and where ideas came from etc. Definitely worth reading if you are a serious TAGS fan. I hope a Mayberry 102 will come out with info on more episodes.
5,"Excellent resource and lots of fun, too","This book is a delight for Andy Griffith fans and scholars alike. I have used this book for graduate work, the Mayberry Bible study, and for a reference tool when I am watching a marathon. Brower brings new insights to these old friends and makes the show even more enjoyable"
5,A very interesting life story,"I love it when the author reads his or her own life story and has the publisher make it available to the public. I found Alda's life to be an interesting one. He was not the stuck up child star. He was very down to earth as a child partly due to his bout with polio. I love the humor in this book as well. There are also some touching moments as well. You will find out how Alda became not just an actor, but a writer and a director as well. You will also find out about alda intrest in science and his conflicts with religion as well. I love it when author's write a different sort of autobiography. one that just doesn't tell you who they are and where they came from. If you liked watching M*A*S*H, you will like listening to alda tell his story."
3,Interesting read but not very revealing of Alda,"Although some parts of the book were interesting, Alda reveals precious little about his life. There are very few pages dedicated to M*A*S*H, the television series for which he is known and I didn't feel like I got to know the true Alan Alda through this book. He never really reveals much about his beliefs or who he truly is, which is disappointing because he seems like an intelligent and compassionate man. He did share his frustration, sadness, and compassion for his mother's schizophrenia and shed some light on the taboo subject of mental illness. I really appreciated that aspect of his book."
5,Never have your dog stuffed and other things I've learned,"I really and truly enjoyed this book so much that I didn't want to put it down,and I didn't,only for sleep and work. I always loved the TV show M A S H and in Australia we are enjoying it all over again To read all about Alan Alda's life from a young boy to now,the struggles and triumps, to find his true love and still be together with children and grandchildren and now enjoying life as he wants to and at the same time still wanting to learn new experiences and entertain people. This is a book that I will read over and over again and I cannot wait to read his next book and hoping he will write more. Thank You"
2,All about Alan and very little else,"I am a big fan of Alan Alda but not of this book. If you are looking for anecdotes of MASH or movies he has been in or people he has worked with - this is NOT the book for you.If you want to know a LOT about his ANGST, his going on longs walks while searching for the meaning of being an actor, and an in depth report of his intestinal blockage while in Chile - this is the book to read! ""It is all about ME"" should be the byline of this book. It reveals more than what Alda actually says."
1,NEVER HAVE YOUR DOG STUFFED,"OPENING LINE,""MY MOTHER DIDN'T TRY TO STAB MY FATHERTILL I WAS 6. MOTHER IS SCHIZOPHRENIC AND BOOK IS FULLOF HER MEAININGLESS STATEMENTS. HIS 11 YEARS OF""MASH"" WERE THE ONLY NORMAL PEOPLE HE WAS EVER KNOWN.HE LEARNED TO ACT, WRITE, DIRECT, AND HOW TO BE A PERSON.THE MASH STORIES SAVED HIS BOOK FROM BEING MINDLESS PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIA. MY TITLE "" ALANTHE LITTLE BOY WHO NEVER GREW UP ""ROBERT ZINKY"
4,Yes! Breaking the Silence....,"Alda's frank description of mother's schizophrenic illness was well done.To those of us who have lived with mental illness, his story rang so true,and also his feelings, both good and bad, were detailed very well. He is to be commended for sharing his story, and all those who 'break the silence' by sharing their stories. Many who are struggling will understand they are not alone, and are joined by thousands of families who have loved ones with mental disorders. Maureen Focht, author Silent Heroes, Courageous Families Living with Depression and Mental Illness.-thesilentheroes.com"
2,Boring,"I got tired reading about him,him, and him and not really saying anything about the people in his life, I always felt that about him and I guess I was right.Marcie Georgetti"
5,Loved it!,"Alan has written a warm, funny & sincere work with this book. I would sometimes laugh & sometimes I would feel sad when I read it. The book was never boring but skipped backwards & forwards through Alan's life in a very entertaining way. I thoroughly enjoyed this book!"
4,"Smart, Funny, Interesting","Smart, funny, interesting book -- just like Alan Alda himself. His story is interesting, his values are rock-solid, and he has a way with words that keeps you turning the pages. Love him!"
2,starts with a bang and then runs out of steam,Alda's early life is a real page turner.You really start rooting for him to make it big after having a hard early life as an actor. Then he quickly gets married and has a kid. I guess he wants to give his family privacy but you learn little about these years after marriage.Then the book slowly loses momentum and meanders with random scenes. Famous kisses? with little mention of his other interactions with anyone. Very little material on MASH. I guess he didn't want to offend anyone alive but it does not inform either.It finishes with the final bang of his days in the hospital.I get the feeling he spent a lot of time writing on his early life and then rushed the ending after his near death experience.
2,Disappointing,"I love Alan Alda as an actor. But his book is a big disappointment. Two major flaws --1) There is very little about M*A*S*H, the show that made him a star.2) The book is just not very funny. I laughed once -- when he knocked on his Mother's casket as if to say, anyone home?He needed a stronger editor."
2,Not Funny,Alan Alda is a funny man. But his book is not. He jumps from here to there leaving one to wonder where he is going with his story. Our book club was anxious to read something different but it was unanimous - thumbs down.
5,ALAN ALDA IS A GREAT AUTHOR!,ALAN ALDA IS A GREAT AUTHOR I GOT MY BOOK TODAY FROM UPS I'M GOING TO READ IT TOMORROW I LOVE ALL THE PICTRES IN THE BOOK ALAN HAS BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS & GRANDDAUGHTER!I GIVE THIS BOOK A 5!FROM A BIG ALAN ALDA FAN FOR 6 YEARS NOW KIRSTEN
5,Good functional tool,The scissors have been a good addition to our greenhouse tools. Handles are nice when using gloves and the plus of stainless steel to not rust in the humidity.
5,My favorite along with Bernstein's first interpretation,"I did not know this conductor before listening to this recording.I could hear excerpts on Itunes and it is wonderfully tuneful, articulate and powerful.Listen for yourself, you won't be disappointed.It shows that no matter professionals recommendations, the best is to judge with your ears instead."
2,A Mess,"This story starts terrifically.For the first 60 or 70 pages, I couldn't put it down.The plot involving the battered baby and her suicide (?) mother is riveting.But then Peak drives into the sands.He detours into a illegal-immigrant story. The story has potential, but he makes little of it. Only one of the dozen immigrants (Nadya) comes alive. The rest are just unnamed children (except Peter, who dies offstage).Worse, the love-story rolls in, and contains absolutely no electricity. The sex scenes are laughable. Right out of a plumbing manual.Forty pages from the end of the book--when the plot should be careening at 110 mph, nothing was happening (except sex-plumbing), I lost interest, and stopped reading.How could something that started so well end so lamely?????Judge for yourself.Or, if you are wise, don't."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!,"There is NO SUCH BOOK! This is the orginal ""The Deep End"" by Joseph Hayes. How it ended up being tagged as a sequel is beyond me. I just got taken by one of the Marketplace Sellers over this. A total hoax..."
2,Love the idea... not quite right though!,"Works great as a calculator; however.... I bought this for my stats class because everything has to be typed into word. There are all the standard math symbols of +, -, *, / but there is NO EQUAL sign! Sure you can hit enter to get the total. But entering in data I have to go back to the keyboard for an = sign. This is in every problem.So, it works. Not what I hoped though. How can you forget the = sign for goodness sake!"
2,too much fragrance oil for my taste,"the tea may have been nice but the bergamot was too strong, like it has too much perfume/fragrance oil in it--too bad because finding organic loose tea is a challenge in this country."
5,Fantastic,"I've read this novel about 3 times already, once you start, you can't wait till it's over. Joan is a genious. Excellent novel."
5,Tosibia D-VR3,Have owned this unit for a week now and have copied several VHS tapes to DVD format using the Fuji DVD-R 4.7 GB discs. Very impressed with this machine. It is very easy to use. Just put your tape in the VCR side and your blank disc in the other and push one button and your off !! Bought for $313.00 at another web merchant so check prices before ordering. This unit can be had for less !!! The unit autmatically adjusts the tape tracking to copy the best image over to the DVD. THe discs come out very very good. I won't repeat what the other reviewer said about the units functionality as I agree with those statements. Overall a great machine for the money.
2,Toshiba D-VR3 DVD Recorder/VCR Combo,"I chose this product because I have a recently-purchased large screen Toshiba TV and an older Toshiba VCR. Those products have been excellent in all respects. This product is very difficult to use, has a poorly-written and unhelpful user's guide, and has poor technical quality in several respects. The DVD recorder produces a mediocre picture. The VCR is very noisy. The remote control is the worst of any product I've owned. The buttons are tiny and the text is very hard to read. The electronic signal is poorly engineered and in general just refuses to work. There are many other problems. I would be glad to be rid of this machine so I could buy a better engineered DVD/VCR player (without the DVD recorder)."
1,DOA,"Thank you Amazon for your easy return.Got it out of the box and tried to format the DVD Ram disk itcame with. At 85% it had a data error. After that it would not read, recognize or write DVDs. Powered off to reset but still broke. Of course I was very disapointed.I going to return and try another and also get a service policy.After reading many reviews of all DVD recorders, I have decided that they all seem problematic and fragile."
1,Poor performance - Finally Died,"I've owned this unit for about three years and use it minimally, perhaps once or twice per month. The unit works fine for pre-made DVDs, but has unacceptable video quality for recordings which work significantly better on the machines of friends. Recently, the unit died completely, and due to the high relative cost of repair, I decided to purchase a competitor's unit."
1,Terrible Quality,I owned and lightly used this product for about 18 months. The remote control seems to work with every other electronics product programmed into it but the Toshiba DVD player. Unfortunately 99% of the functionality of the product is lost without the remote - I assume the sensor on the DVD Player is dead but will keep you posted.
1,Too many problems...,"I've owned this unit for almost a year. I have two major problems with it. First, DVD's start skipping, sticking, jumping, after about an hour of play. I'm talking pre-recorded movies, not home made stuff. I pull the CD out and play it in my 5 year old TV/VCR/DVD combo unit in the bedroom, (from Walmart), and the DVD plays just fine. I've used the standard DVD cleaners to see if that was the problem...nothing. Secondly, the remote control unit is horrible. The buttons are very small and I have to be, literally, 7-8 feet from the unit, standing up, and pointing it exactly at the unit to get it to work. I've changed the batteries many times just in case that was the problem. Basically, it's a worthless clunker of a unit. I'm shopping for a replacement today. I see that this unit has several nice reviews, but I cannot echo those sentimeents. Caveat emptor!"
1,Not what I wanted,"Cute book, but not what I wanted for my classroom. It had been listed with an online lesson plan for ESL students. It was NOT a good choice for either the lesson or ESL students. I sent it back for a full refund."
1,An insult to mythology and intelligence,Spirit>the intelligent or immaterial part of man as distinguished from the body. The animating or vital principal in living things. This is the defination of the word spirit...something the authors of this woeful mess called planescape clearly never read. I have been playing ADND for years and this is a disaster to the concepts of death and the afterlife in the game. It makes me sad......
4,"Great! A definate purchase, but a bit too short.","The books were all great, and I definately recommend this book to any Planescape fan, even those just interested in it because of Torment. There are some great posters, too, including one of the Sigil landscape (that you see in used in Torment) and some other ones showing the mechanics and layouts of the planes, which is a great visual aid. However, the books were a bit too short and you'll find yourself wanting more and buying even more, like the Monster Compendiums. The Monster Compendium included in the box was so short that I was wondering what the point was. All in all, though, this is a definate buy and a great campaign setting where anything is possible."
4,It's a Start,I am a die hard Planescape fan. I like this product but it trys to cover 2 many things in a short amount of pages. But considering this was the 1st box set thats not 2 bad. Later products cover a lot more info and our more helpful to the DM.
4,One of the most dynamic settings TSR has ever produced,"Probily intended for more mature gamers not because of content but becuase of consept. If your players are roll- players (Munkins/Power Gamers you know who you are!) this is your ultimate chance, but if you and your group is truelly role playing and enjoy exotic new settings give this one a look, You'll find it to be one of the best settings If your feeling realy brave try using the mage system with this game, they work surprizingly well."
1,World's WORST butter crunch toffee!!!,I paid approximately $33 for a pound of STALE candy! The candy was shipped to me in a low grade zip -lock like baggie. The candy was stale and flavor-less! I will never order from this company again!!!
1,This works very well--until it doesn't!,"I am sorry to say that after less than one month, two of the four units I purchased have stopped working. The ionizing wand has stopped producing any air current at all. I wrote to the company about the first one when it broke, and they said I should return it for ""repair or replacement"". I think if it is broken after only one month, repair is out of the question; replacement would be the only option. Then this morning, a second unit stopped functioning. These units are not in ""high pollution"" areas--one is in my office and one in my bedroom. Very sad, because when they were working, it was the best three weeks I've had in terms of air quality. But that comes to about 40 dollars per week--not acceptable! I will update this review as I get more information, but at present, caveat emptor."
1,Does emit ozone,"Was hoping this ionizer would freshen up things a bit without emitting harmful ozone. For first two days of operation I noticed smell but wasn't concerned as I thought this was the ""fresh air"" phenomena. But after hours of internet searching I determined that this smell was ozone due to the hint of chlorine. Several more days later, the room that I put it in started to smell like ozone. Also, my girlfriend has woken up with headaches while machine has been in operation.Wand also appears to no longer give off the same amount of ""ionic breeze"" as it did when first plugged in."
5,Try the Zhops for this movie at a lower price!,"If you really want this movie and not want to fork over $92(plus shipping and handling) try Amazon.com Zshops or Auctions!I got it from a vendor in ZShops and only paid $19 plus $4 for shipping!So if want to fork over almost $100 for a fine,I just gave the people who want this movie a alternative!Other than that it's a great erotic thriller with Michael Pare nude a few times in love with woman in miami!It is rated R for nudity,swearing and violence!"
4,Great Clinical Reference Guide,"Prior to purchasing this book, I had read some excellent techniques that Dr. Barkley had recommended when working with children with ADHD. I then purchased this book and began implementing the books training program with the families that I work with. The thing that I appreciated about this book is the care the Dr. Barkely takes in educating the parents on ADHD, helping to improve the relationship between parent and child and then looking to implement a behavior plan to improve the childs acting out behaviors. By doing this, it provided a more comprehensive parent training plan rather than solely implementing a behavior modification plan. At times Dr. Barkley's explainations can be a little blunt which may put off some parents who are reading this as a self help guide. Otherwise, it is an exellent resource for those therapists needing clinical guidance in implementing an effective parental training program."
4,CHECKMATE,"The birth of the computer dominates this classic tale of passion and revenge in Elizabeth Gage's third outing. Her sexy heroine Francie Bollinger may be a genius in electronics but what a looser she is in romance. In fact, all of Gage's characters stink in love. And boy does she make them suffer for it. From incest to rape to murder, the novel screams of clichés, yet with her skillful plot, characterization and prose Gage succeeds in making this a powerful experience. (SPOILER AHEAD) The bad guys may pay and the good guys may win in the end, but the path to there is one heck of a read.-----Martin Boucher"
4,INTERESTING,I COULD NOT TURN THE PAGES FAST ENOUGH. THE ONLY THING I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT THIS STORY WAS THAT THE ENDING WAS SO PREDICTABLE. IT DEFINATELY HELD MY INTEREST.
4,Careful,"This one says ""all top 10 hits"" but there is also a Music Express with ""20 original hits 20 original stars"" which I think is the original version."
3,should be 20 original hits 20 original stars,"I agree with KeithG. I owned the original vinyl record back in the early 70's, and the original record had 10 songs per side. It was pushing the limits of vinyl technology. This item was modified from the original and does not include half of the songs the original one had. I will not be buying this one, unless I can find the other half of the songs."
3,SamSung Car Charger/USB/earplug,"It arrived on time. So far the car charger is useful. I haven't got a MicroSD for the phone yet, so I haven't used the USB cable. The earplug sucks, I'd try wireless next time around. I was thinking I'd use them like my MP3 player/phone, but they are too large to fit good and they are hard plastic ( no foam outers)."
4,A Fun Childhood Memory,"Been looking for a copy of this book for ages. Was one of my favorites growing up, and now I can read it with my daughter and son. Join Grover as he explores the museum with strange rooms such as ""The Very Small Things Room,"" or the ""Everything Up In The Sky Room,"" ""The All Vegetables Other Than Carrots Room"" and many many others. Each room shows many common things in the world around us, each labeled for beginner readers. Fun illustrations for small children as well, with many of the Sesame Street Characters hidden in the illustrations. (Sorry, no Elmo here though...it's a little before his time!) A Great memory from my childhood that I now get to share with my kids."
5,Starlight Cafe,This latest release of Dmitri's is jazz that fits any mood - a real joy for listening. We attended the debut at Carnegie Hall and the audience was enthralled! A must for Xmas stockings or any time of the year!
2,Not Vegetarian,"Heads up to vegetarians ordering this product. It says ""Vegetarian"" on the front, but the ingredients include shellfish and SHARK, neither of which are in fact vegetables. ""Yeah, I'm a vegetarian. But every once in a while I slip and just have to dig into some delicious shark"", said no one ever. Is selling shark even legal in this country? Gave 2 stars because, and in the defense of ""Nature's Answer"", the shark-eating vegetarian market is extremely under served at this point in time and the more specialty products out there the better."
4,My son loves it,a pain to put together and the doors have a tendency to unhinge - but he loves it and has had and played with it for over two years now. Usually- he loves removing the doors and makes it a part of his story or puts them on oppposite ends of the room to make the play area larger. Just bought it for my nephew's b-day.
4,Fun but not durable...,"My son waited so long for this toy and it has turned out to be a big disappointment! The Barred Wall did not fit properly resulting in it breaking within the first ten minutes of play. I broke the balcony trying to snap the floor in...the instructions have you put the floor in after you attach the balcony- I recommend putting together the rails, adding the floor then attaching it to the wall. The weapons DO NOT stay in the holder when you spin the door. Some of the pieces are too short to ""snap"" into the walls as directed- I had to glue them. My son loves playing with it, broken pieces and all but I feel it is overpriced for what we received. I would take it back but my son is making the best of it."
3,"Great concept, poor construction","I bought this for my six year old's b-day. He is a huge TMNT fan. He is very gentle with toys but this thing broke almost immediatly. The fire escape feature broke the first time he used it and the trap door broke a couple days later. There is a part where you can attach your turtles or bad guys by the feet to battle each other. Only problem is, it is just about impossible for a child, or adult for that matter to get a foot in the mechanism and get it to stay there. We were very dissappointed with the quality, but still love the Ninja Turtles!"
1,don't waste your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,It's Christmas again! We got this playset last year and it went out in the trash last week! We hardly played with it because the parts kept coming apart and the kids always needed help putting it back together. Finally it just laid there.....................It was not worth the time or money. The kids didn't even care when I threw it out!
4,Before you assemble have Krazy Glue on hand,"My son received this for his 5th birthday. It took me some time to put it together and keep it together. Fortunately I had glue on hand and once I glued it I was in business. As an adult the problem I have is the turtles don't really fit the sewer hole and my son can't close it alone.From his point of view, he never wants to close it anyway so that doesn't matter. He pushes the turtle in the sewer hole and is not the least bit concerned that it should be easier as it is how they are supposed to get into their home.Bottom line is HE LOVES IT!!!!So have the glue ready and let your kids have a ball."
2,he loved it....,"My son is in to the turtles big time! He has it all. Last year at christmas he saw this playset and had to have it. I thought what a great idea. Yes,it may take you a few minutes to put it together, but it was worth it, I thought. Its been almost a year and everytime, it never fails, he is yelling at me to come help him fix something on it, this wall came unsnapped, I tried to move it and the whole thing came apart,etc. It only takes a few times for that, before a 5 year old is done with it and moved on to something else to use his creative little mind on. Sounds like a great toy. Well I gave it 3 stars for fun, he loved it so much while it stayed together. Durability got 1 star because, after a 5 year old beats up shredder a few times on it,the durablity life is very slim. Boys are going to have a couple of ninja fights in this Lair, and if he is dying to have I say get it,but you may have to get creative and use glue to get the snaps to snap! it was fun while it lasted."
2,Looks a lot better than it is...,"My kids are huge fans of the turtles. I thought they were going to LOVE the Lair. Problem is, the thing won't stay together! This toy was frustrating to both them and me, because I contantly had to fix it. This was one big waste of money. Unless your children are VERY gentle with their toys, DON'T BUY IT!"
1,CHEAP PLASTIC-PEICE OF JUNK-DON'T BUY IT!!,"This toy is a MAJOR disappointment. It is made of cheap, thin plastic. It won't stay together at all. It was always in pieces. My 6 and 4 year old lost interest in it immediately since they couldn't use the ""rip cord"" or the balcony, since they kept coming off. And they are BOTH MAJOR TMNT fans. This toy is worthless. A toy this expensive should be made better! We have had much better luck with the sturdy Rescue Heroes line of toys."
2,worst toy yet,"My son who is 41/2 had to have this for Christmas. He was brought to tears when he opened it Christmas morning. I am brought to tears every night when I put it away. It is the worst constructed toy I have ever purchased. My son does not even play with it much out of frustration. Every time you touch it something falls apart!!! The trap door is already broken. I have 3 words for this poorly constructed toy. CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP!!"
1,A piece of junk!!!,"My gentle 5-year-old son received this toy from Santa. The toy is made so cheap, it's a total rip off. He's hardly played with it, because it keeps falling apart. The plastic is thin and when connected (the sides, top and floor have to keep being put together), it stays until you accidently bump it or try to make the turtles scale the wall. If it was made all one piece it would've been so much better. I've never been so disappointed with a purchase. It's worth maybe $5 not $50."
2,AWFUL TOY,This toy is awful!!!! It constantly falls apart when my boys are playing with it (ages 6 and 3). I am very unhappy with this purchase!!! It was expensive to be such a disappointment!!!!!
1,Dissatisfied Customer,The Ninja Turtle Lair is not durable. This toy constantly falls apart. My 5 year old son gets frustrated with this toy and will not play with it. We are very dissatisfied with our purchase.
2,save your money and buy a better product,"I highly recomend not purchasing this product. After you have spent well earned time putting together you will need great patience later for all the time you spend putting it back together each time your child plays with it. No matter how well you put it together it will not stay together. This will frustrate your child almost as much as it will frustrate you. For the price of this toy you would think it was a one time put together project. It comes in three big pieces and it will stay three pieces. I do not recommend this product at all and highly urge parents to rethink this purchase, I know we have. You are better off with the Rescue Heroes play sets."
2,Fun when it stays together!!,I hate this thing!! It NEVER stays together anymore!! I can't get to stay closed to store. I can't get it to stay together to even play w/. Save your $$$$.
4,"Get some glue, but it is a lot of fun!","My 7 year old loves this toy. The walls come apart from the flooring very quickly, but I found that if I glued the walls to the floor, it is very durable. That way, it won't tip over and fall apart. My son adores it and we have fun playing with it. I think it is a bit pricey, but he's played with it more than some other (more expenisve) super hero ""lairs"". It's a lot bigger than most and easier to manipulate. When it falls apart, it's pretty easy to put together again. Isn't having fun what it's all about? And my son has a blast with it. He's had it for quite a while and still enjoys it, which says a lot about it. He has too many toys that he's only played with for a day or two."
4,"Great buy, but drew blood on assembly","This is a good buy for any kid who likes the TMNT. It was a pain to put together, only because the snapping parts did not align well. I drew blood on it several times, and finally just dropped it and moved onto the Legos for a short while. My hubby finally got it together, and it does convert to the carrying case easily, I will say that. Which makes storage of, not only the set, buy his figures much easier."
1,CHEAPLY MADE,"My son hardly ever plays with this toy because every time you pick it up it falls apart. The whole thing snaps together and DOES NOT stay. You can absolutely NOT carry it by the handle. When we try to do this, the whole thing falls apart in pieces. After having it for a year and hardly ever playing with it, I tried to sell it at a garage sale. It did not sell, so I threw it in the garbage. This toy would be a good idea if it was constructed better. It is GARBAGE and it will drive you crazy constantly having to put it back together."
1,Ninja turtle lair,"This is not a very fun toy. I really wanted it for my 8th birthday and my parents bought it for me. Every time I tried to use it, it fell apart. The walls won't stay together. My Mom had said she read a review about that problem, and now I know it's true. I don't like to play with it and I'm giving it away. I would not tell other kids to buy this toy. It was disappointing."
2,Falls apart!,"This toys seemed like a great idea, but it fell apart quickly. My girlfriend and I both got it for our five year-olds and both dumped them in our next garage sale. I couldn't even sell it because it was in so many pieces! Not worth the money."
5,Authentic and beautiful,"This book is NOT for you if you are going to be freaked out by explicit (beautiful, poetic, explicit) images, or by women of various ages and body types (as opposed to silicone-implanted Barbie dolls), or if you think that the tensions and grimaces (and radiant smiles) of orgasm are ""un-lady-like"".It IS for you (whether you are female, male, straight, gay or bi) if you are interested in seeing real women gleefully demonstrating their favourite methods of masturbation in gorgeous black-and-white photographs by a selection of different photographers (some female, some male as well), accompanied by their own words and thoughts about solo sex.""I Am My Lover"" is joyous, liberatory, educational, and jaw-droppingly erotic. None of the photos are ""staged"" or designed to fit someone else's idea of what's sexy - the sexual energy is so real it seems to shine off the pages."
2,Probably groundbreaking for a prior generation...,"We bought this as a (heterosexual) couple, and were fairly disappointed. From the title we were hoping for a first-person narative exploration of the subject of female masturbation, including physical techniques, fantasies, and some of the social prejudices surrounding this subject. However, the text is much more abstract than this. Some of the subjects have included brief commentaries on their pictures, some poetry, and some have provided no discussion at all. The photos themselves do not hold a great deal of artistic merit and would probably not even be considered particularly erotic by most people. The work is ""groundbreaking"" in that it shows real women engaged in an extremely intimate act, but does not have much to offer individuals of either sex interested in the subject of female masturbation."
2,Not enough emotion in the Photography,"I am a photographer with some experience in nude photography. I ordered the book because I was hoping to find some inspiration for my own work, however most of the pictures are a mear documentation of the act and do not capture the emotion and the beauty of masturbation. I also did not like the fact that more than half the woman had tattoos or body piercing. As is often the case, the best photograph is on the cover of the book."
1,I was disappointed,"The other reviews said great things about the book. However, when I got it, it was not appealing at all (in my opinion....to men and women). The women are regular women, but many have tattoos and piercings that were just too weird for this reader. I thought I would learn something from the book, but instead it almost repulsed me. I have returned the book."
1,This is not a helpful book.,"I can't believe somebody said, ""this book unlocks the woman within."" Are you ladies nuts? This book is trashy, crude and distasteful. I also returned my book. It was a waste of money."
3,Just a question,"I haven't read or seen this book, only seen its title. I think it is an important book to make though and I congratulate Joani Blank and friends for putting it forth. My only impression of it from reading the reviews and from my own experience of other books of this pioneering style is that sometimes they can lack some of the 'emotion' aspect as someone else mentioned. It ends up appealing more to the mind/intellect or being merely visually glamorous, as opposed to being earthy and sensual, as one would expect from the title. This is a sweeping generalization, I know...Sorry. :\My other comment is why are both the photographers men? Surely there are many talented women photographers who would've loved to work on this project. Through sheer identification, women photographers might have added some extra warmth and insight to to the images and the book, and also be the owners of 'the look' in terms of presenting women to themselves. PS - Excuse the rating! Had to fill it in."
2,The hard cover book was bent,"The book was badly bent upon receipt. I received the book in a plastic bag, I do not hink this was a good idea."
5,Great resource for beginning to intermediate stats,"I used this book in a first year MBA program and found it a great resource. Stat freaks complain that Excel is not SPSS - true! But many many more business people have access to Excel, along with a reasonable ability to do FAST basic statistics."
3,Nothing to do with Excel or How To,"Don't let the title mislead you: Statistics for Managers Using Microsoft Excel (Student Solutions Manual) has almost nothing to do with Microsoft Excel. This book is useful IF and only if you are using it as a companion to the Statistics for Managers Using Microsoft Excel text book in a statistics class.The book provides ANSWERS. It does not provide any how-to; it does not provide any Excel formulas/etc. But is does provide the answers to all of the even-numbers problems in the companion text book. That's the only reason it got as much as a ""3 stars"" rating from me -- it was helpful for feedback."
1,Poorly Written and Confusing,This book does not help with understanding statistics. The examples are confusing and often point out a problem but never solve or resolve the problem. Don't buy this book!
2,Terrible...,"Didn't help with my class. The problems were not accurate for the class, and didn't help me get ready for the tests. This book sucked."
4,THE VERMILLION GATE,"I am very pleased with this book. As a matter of fact I read it in my youth. I am now 73 years old. Unfortunately one of my classmates at school lent it to me. A few years later I tried to find it, looked for it at different libraries and invariably was told it was out of print.A couple of months ago, a friend told me to enter Amazon.com to see if I could find it. To my suprise, the book was listed. I proceeded to order it and had it sent to my daughter's address in the U.S. Even though the book is not new, it is in excellent condition. I will enjoy reading it again !!!!Thank you !!!!!Martha Kaye"
2,"Yes, a battery hog","This scale is a battery hog, wrote Jason. Yes it is.It uses two CR2032 button cells. Each cell is rated at 240 mAh from 3V (new) down to 2V. The scale is poorly designed in that it quits working, and starts flashing the battery icon, while the series voltage is still above 5.36V. If it were properly designed it would work all the way from 6V down to 4V.I bought new batteries today. They cost $4.89 for the pair."
4,Perfect except . . .,"I love my Salter scale and highly recommend. As others have said, it is compact, easy to store and to operate. I've been using for almost three years and have not had to replace the battery.My one quibble - the readout is dim. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish fractions - 3/8 or 5/8 - in less than bright light."
3,To Small,"This is a scale that was purchased for use as a portion control device. Unfortunaltly, if you put a dinner plate on the scale the readout is almost impossible to see and the button to zero the scale is very difficult to reach. This is not so much a flaw in the design as a purchase made for the wrong use. For small bowl or small portion weighing this scale performs up to par, but if your looking for something to use with a dinner plate, look elsewhere."
1,Quit working after six months!!!,"I loved this scale at first. Then, after about six months it started showing an ""error"" message whenever I tried to zero it. I let it sit up in the cabinet for several months until I could remember to pick up some new batteries, and started using my manual one. I rejoined Weight Watchers and decided to start using the digital scale once again. After replacing the batteries, it would not come on at all. Both my husband and I tried putting the batteries in and it still wouldn't come on. I was so disgusted with the thing that I just threw it in the trash. Would not recommend it to anyone! A total waste of money! Look elsewhere for a scale!"
3,kitchen scale,Its an alright scale. Nothing fancy. I do have some problems with setting it back to zero. Its good for a starter scale.
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this scale after receiving many recommendations about Salter's quality. However, after not using it for the past three months, I turned it on and I received an error. I called Salter and they said not to worry and that they'd fix or replace it. They gave me an address to send the scale to. So I pay to mail it back to the address I was given and upon checking the delivery confirmation status after finding the slip, I read that the package was undeliverable. So I was given the wrong address by their service representative and one of two things will now happen: I'll receive the scale back (although unlikely, as it's been quite some time since it was refused) and I'll have to AGAIN pay to ship it to them to fix hoping they give me the right address, OR it's lost in the mail and I have to buy a new scale entirely. I am thoroughly disappointed."
1,Broke after a year,"It was great while it worked, but it only worked for a year. No explanation.It gave an error message and that was that!"
1,defective,"This product arrived defective. I spoke to the company and after attempting a fix, they told me to return it.Can't say anymore."
1,Very disappointed,How hard can it be for this scale to work?! Well....it doesn't even turn on. Changed batteries and still no luck. I will be returning this item.
1,Piece of Junk,I bought this scale 2 months ago and it started to act strange after a few weeks. The numbers jump all around and it won't zero. I replaced the batteries and now it just errors out.I wish I bought it at Target so I could go and exchange it but now I have to figure out how to get warranty service for something I need every day.I had another scale for 5 years prior to this and it broke after my kids spilled water on it. I wish I would have kept that one!
5,Wonderful Kitchen Scale!!,"I had a dial type scale before this electronic one and I just LOVE this one so much!! It switches easily from grams to ounces and the read out is immediate and accurate. The best feature is that you can put a bowl or cup on the scale and reset the scale to zero. Then you can add your items and measure just the weight of the item added! If you need to add more items to the same bowl, simply reset to zero again and it will only measure the additional items. No more measuring in one dish and putting it into another. Saves on additional dishes to wash! I am on Weight Watchers and it has made measuring so much easier and more exact. No more guessing if I have a cup of something, I can simply measure the exact gram weight and know I haven't ""rounded up"" with the traditional measuring cup! This item was definitely worth the money. I LOVE it."
2,"Works good, when it works...","I can understand one bad unit slipping through and into the hands of consumers.But I'm on my second one now, and it's about to be returned too.First unit kept turning off while I was measuring ingredients, about 15 minutes out of the box.Second unit also has a tendency to turn off WHILE MEASURING ingredients. Not good. Ever try fishing out baking powder from flour, since your scale turned off while watching the display INCREASE it's measurements?So, weigh ingredients seperately as a work around. But now the scale won't tare correctly. Goes from zero to 1 to zero to one on a flat surface. And finally it decided to really go bananas and start hunting and pecking all over the range!It's being returned for yet another replacement, since I need something this weekend... but I believe I'll be ordering up a different unit and returning this one after I get it."
3,Didn't last long,I was given this model as a Christmas gift and it did not last but 5 months before it started having problems. I do not like the oz. measurements in fractions as I prefer decimals so I will not buy this particular model as a replacement. When it was working it appeared to be measuring correctly.
3,A Fragle Device!,"Digital kitchen scales are kind of like microwave ovens - once you experience them, you'll never be without one. And when this particular one is working, it's a wonderful thing. But I found it to be rather touchy. You must be very careful not to bang it around on your counter while using it - mine eventually went belly-up due to a drop of 8""! God forbid you should drop it on the floor.That said, mine did last the better part of two years, which I suspect is well above the average life, and that's just not right. But if you buy one of these, I'd advise that you not expect it to last a lifetime, or spring for a sturdier model. Perhaps the bugs have been worked out by now, and the technology improved - just be forewared, this is a fragle device!jm"
1,don't waste your money,scale stopped working soon after I got it-replaced batteries - which are expensive - and it still doesn't work - in the trash it went
5,Love this scale!,"I really love this scale. It is so easy to keep it clean while in the kitchen. It is so easy to use; just one button to push. It is so lightweight and easy to store, too. Very happy with my purchase."
5,Simple and effective.,"I've had a couple months to test this kitchen scale out and the score is in: It's awesome. It's simple, easy to use, and weighs everything accurately done to every little grain. And I can also use it to weigh my packages which is awesome for someone like me who mails things out all the time.If you're looking for a new kitchen scale, go for this one. The price is right, it's accurate, weighs very little itself so it's easy to transport from room to room, and it just works great. Also, it's easy to read.Now I can make perfect pizzas with every ingredient weighed perfectly, every time!"
5,I've had mine for years and it's still going strong!,"I love this little scale and have had no problems with it. . . so far. And I've had it for over 5 years. I don't know why people say it's a battery hog. I've only had to replace the battery twice. I hope it lasts another 5 years, but if it doesn't I'll buy another."
4,Excellent optics and a bargain!,"I've had Leupolds, Zeiss sand Swarovskis and done my fair share of research on binos.The Pentax DCF 8x32 is a steal. They are clear,super quality and handles superb.I will say they are better than the Swarovski SLC 8x30, wich I also own, and a clear 4 star rating.They also have a quality feel the Monarchs don't have. You will have to pay another 1000-1500 USD to get a better one! and that includes the new ED version.Buy it, no buy two!!"
3,Academicians Beware...,"This book contains neither a Table of Contents nor an Index. If you are planning on using this book for research, I recommend going elsewhere."
1,WORTHLESS piece of junk!! Not true Infocus bulb.,"My gut feeling was telling me something wasn't right when my package arrived because I didn't see the Infocus logo anywhere. The only reason I purchased from this seller is because they posted the bulb is Infocus brand.After only 586 hours, 4 months of usage and $250 later the bulb is dead. Never again will I waste money buying from this seller. I emailed the seller and got no response. Buyer BEWARE!!"
4,It Works and Was Clean,Came with extra bags and belt. Works so far. Would rather have a bagless with hepa filter--but for the price and the built in duster/cleaner-I thought it was worth a try.
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased 2 of these for my sons for Christmas, they are not windows XP friendly. I emailed the Tech support with questions and they have not answered my questions after 7 days. I will be returning these."
1,never by anyone of this co.'s product,"First, device itself has a bad quality.pictures- useless, video- worse, voice recorder - I never used it.You might find out that as a web cam it has pretty good quality compare to other normal web cams, but if you are using Windows XP, this thing goes to junk.I bought a Dell 700m just a week ago.I was so happy to get one, but than this darn thing keeps freezing my new laptop. I have some friends to talk oversea, so I'm still keeping this junk, but I'm planning to replace it with different web cam. probably a Logitech's. I heard their are good. Anyway i spent 100$ when i bought this, and I absolutely wasted my money![...]"
3,More gray than white.,"Don't know if this cable makes my network any faster than a cat5, but since I have gigabit switches I decided to buy cat6 cables.Cons: The package says white but next to another white cable this one is gray!"
2,I was bluffed!!,"I saw the beautiful earrings on the net and decided to buy them, along with some other stuff. When my package came home they were nothing like the picture, I don`t know what happened but a pair of plain hoops was what I recieved..."
5,What music is all about,"Never mind are you a U2 fan. Never mind are you a Rock music fan. Are you a music fan?? This dvd is music at it's best; most inspiring, most moving, most invigorating...bottom line, its most FRICKIN MIND BLOWING. I defy anyone out there to tell me a more awesome 30 seconds of music than the intro to ""Where the streets have no name""!!Having seen the Elevation gig in three different cities, this dvd is a truly great memento of a truly legendary band. The greatest in the world at present."
2,Great concert but poor editing,U2's performance at Boston lived up to expectations. The sound quality was as good as it gets. My major complaint however was the editing. The director would switch camera angles every 2 seconds which was really annoying. Maybe this is the popular way to edit now days but for me it was almost unwatchable. I don't need to see a song performance from 60 different angles in the span of 2 minutes. The idea of using the fancam in the audience was what I was waiting for. I would watch the whole concert from the fancam option. But unfortunately the picture quality was poor and the sound was also poor. A better way of doing it would have cameras zooming on each of the band members and have the option of choosing which bandmember you wanted to watch on screen. Much like the webcast concert from Notre Dame.
5,Just like being there,"The concert portion of this packed DVD set is fantastic...great, clear picture quality, certain angles that are like you're in the heart, and great moments that feel just like the real thing.This set is an excellent value with all of the extras they've added."
5,Genius @ Boston,"This DVD is heartstopping! Everything about it is pure U2 - their communication with the audience is really powerful. The filming makes you feel as if you're standing right in front of them. The collection of songs is great and the extra features lets you see things you never have before. The extra tracks on Disc 2 are amazing, particularly Beautiful Day which is....beautiful.If you're like me, waiting for their next album, you will keep watching this, to remind you U2 are always here to save rock 'n' roll."
4,It's about the music....,"It's nice to see U2 get back to the basics after the overblown Achtung and Pop tours. Here it's all about the music. The stage set is sparse by U2 standards-no 100 foot tall tv screens or volkswagen beetles hanging from the ceiling. Just a band on stage playing great music. There are quite a few extras here, some of them are rather pointless, like the small clips from past tours. These serve only to drive home the point that flashier is not always better. The band sounds tight, the mix is great, the picture is clear and the energy comes off the screen and into your living room in a powerful way. Bono can't quite hit some of the notes the way he used to (see ""Bad"") but there really isn't anything here that is performed weakly or smacks of self-indulgence. I would have liked to see more from Zooropa and Achtung on this set, but it's still quite good. Definitely worth the $."
4,It will elevate you...,great.. for all music lovers.. especially if your a U2 fan...enjoy .. and music.....
5,One of the best concert DVD's you can Buy...,...and I don't even LIKE U2! I bought this for my wife. I'm surprised I like it so much.
5,It will Rock your world!,"I didn't get to see them on this tour, but after buying this DVD and watching it on my surround system, I'll be seeing them live forever. This concert (on DVD) will rock your world. The band is polished and perfect. The entire band just simply ROCKS!The audience is off their feet (jumping up & down) for (almost) the entire show. You'll see an energy that no other Rock and Roll show can emit.This DVD (2 disk set) is worth alot more than they're charging, believe me.Every song on it is just perfect.Buy it!You won't regret it"
3,Good But Inconsistent,"I liked this concert DVD but it has it's good and it has it's bad (where have we heard that before?)The Good-The Edge uses his Explorer on I Will Follow instead of his yellow Les Paul-Bad was finally on a U2 concert VHS/DVD (Rattle and Hum is a movie, not a concert video)-Where the streets have no name performance was fantastic-The Gibson Explorer makes its return!!-Beautiful day performanceThe Bad-The performance of one of my favorite songs ""The Fly"" wasn't that good because it didn't really have the energy it should have had.-One song from Zooropa, One and a half songs from Pop, One song from War, One from The Unforgettable Fire, some albums aren't fairly represented-I've seen better setlists, although the DVD did include some of my favorites"
4,"Great package, ok concert","I went to show #1 at FleetCenter (this is show #2) and as they even mention in the DVD, they admit the first 2 shows in Boston weren't their finest hour--check out the 'making of' on the DVD and see Edge kick his guitar off stage because things didn't go so well.The actual set list on the 6th had more songs than the DVD. For whatever reason, ""Mysterious Ways,"" ""Pride,"" and ""One"" were done at the concert but left off the DVD. Of course, if you're a U2 fan, you've heard it all before, but it's not really an entire concert.The 2nd DVD is great, the making of snippets are very interesting, and all in all it's a very entertaining package. U2 weren't at their best at this part of the tour, but it's still a must-own DVD for any casual U2 fan."
3,"Good, but not superb","When U2 stretch, they are incredible. So songs like ""The Fly"" and ""Desire"" in this show are very soulful and original. Unfortunately, much of the rest of the Elevation Tour performances hardly veer from their respective album versions, so your appetite for fresh music is never completely satisfied with this DVD. That, and the guys just look a bit too tired and bored much of the time - you can tell that this is several months into a fulltime tour! (Not that I can fault them - they're over 40 now) Then again, U2 have never been huge into improv. So if you're looking for the same hunger and charisma here as in 'Rattle and Hum', you won't find what you're looking for. But get it anyway - it's still as good as rock and roll gets right now!"
5,Anamorphic Widesrceen?,"Great performance !Unfortunately, the DVD is not in 16x9 format which is odd because it was shot in widescreen 1.85:1. Very dissappointing.Moreover, the supplement material(with the excepetion of additional tracks) is in widescreen (1.85:1) but it's not anamorphic. U2 are great performers. This tour really captured the essence of the band displaying their passion,talent and ability to to deliever. This band just keeps getting better and better. Hopefully the same can be said for their DVD productions. Will see next time."
2,Im dizzy and nausious from all the glitzy production,Who is the Hamish guy. This is so rediculously overproduced its sickening. Why all the movie style editing and camera work. At points it looks completely fake. It not even the entire show. Three tracks are missing due to them wanting to put other bonus stuff on there. The making of is really interesting though. Proves that they just manufactured a show. The energy and atmosphere at the show just plain sucks. Slane Castle was way better. Dont waste your money unless youre a huge fan. Get Slane
4,Even Better Then The Real Thing....,"This live ""Film"" seems to have caught U2 in a very interesting part of their career. Bono's Dad has recently died and they seem to be coming to the reality that ""All things fade away"", and that eternity comes very close when we lose a loved one. The passion in this performance is second to none. There is talk that some of their other shows on this tour were better, although, it is always the same with fans that ""their show was better"". I think that U2 will go down in history as one of, if not THE greatest band of their time. I know many would probobly disagree, however... time shall tell us, just as it has done with all artists, who shall be remembered. A very interesting point to watch in this, is the guy's face's, I think this tells the true story. Good value from Amazon..."
5,Fantastic Concert + Great for Film Students,"Amazing concert, great setlist, performances, etc., etc. -- it's all been said in previous reviews.However, it should be pointed out that this DVD is a fantastic tool for students of television and film production. The ""Director Cam"" bonus feature on the 2nd disc is an unparalleled opportunity to watch the legendary Hamish Hamilton directing the show from the broadcast truck. You'll learn more about directing a major live production from this DVD than from any textbook. Hamilton is a true visionary who clearly loves what he does and knows how to get the best out of his extremely talented camera crew and control room staff.I only wish a similar control room recording existed for the 2005 Chicago DVD (also directed by Hamilton; also a spectacular visual achievement).Though, admittedly, the camera mounted on Bono's sunglasses smacks of gimmickry. Fortunately it is only used in the first three songs. I'm sure it seemed cool at the time."
4,Very good concert!,"This is a very good show, but suffers from a bad set list. Brilliant U2 live songs such as ""one"", ""New years day"", Mysterious ways"" have been left out.Also Bons vocals tend to get a bit ragged at times. Get the U2 live at Slane Castle DVD which is probably one of the greatest rock concerts ever put on DVD."
2,oh man....,"First of all I must say I agree 100% with Michael Behuniak from Seattle, WA USA and Chris from NYC.It would really really really be nice to watch the guitar player during guitar solos ..and be able to see the camera hold a steady shot of the whole band, performing as a group, instead of all dizzying, distracting, MTV style fast pace editing....other than that, the music is great..."
3,The U2 fan should buy this but.......,"THE GOOD - Packaging is very good, the set-list is very good, the sound quality is good, Bono's voice is solid and the extras are OK (views from a tiny camera in Bono's shades as well as the fancam were interesting ideas).THE NOT-SO-GOOD - the shooting of the film was disappointing in that they switched views every couple seconds which made it look like a Nissan car commercial as opposed to a concert. Personally, I do not need to see a close up of Bono's face on every other shot and just when you get a good look at the entire band playing, it moves to...take a guess....another close up of Bono who also goes a little over the top with some of his theatrics. As for the others, was Adam even there?? the Edge and Larry get a little more exposure, but not much."
5,Killer live DVD...U2 rocks!,"I got this dvd the day it came out and couldn't wait to see it...I've since bought it for two other people as gifts. To put it simply, I love this dvd! You'd think after watching the dvd that it was post 9-11 with the emotion of the show...I was shocked to find out it was filmed in June. My favorite part is the middle when they play ""Desire"", ""Stay(awesome version)"", ""Bad"", and ""Where The Streets Have No Name"" back to back. I was out of breath the first couple of times I watched it! ""Beautiful Day"" flat out rocks and ""Walk On"" was a great way to close the show. Buy this DVD now!"
1,"Its an mtv music video, not a concert!","This is not concert video footage, its more like still photos with music (the music is great though!). The Video editing is absolutely annoying! I totally agree with Michael Behuniak's review, that this is a great concert RUINED by hackneyed camara work. I really can't believe that U2 released this DVD without first viewing it themselves."
5,U2 Conquers America,"U2 winds up their biggest year with the video capturing the concert video of the year. The self proclaimed ""greatest rock and roll"" act going hosts a concert blending new songs with the classics which have lasted the test of time.I saw this tour twice, and some of the features on the DVD bring you right back into the arena.This is absolutely a must have for fans of U2. Unfortunately, we could only wish that more songs from the tour could have been added, including ""One"", and their first single ""Out of Control""."
4,Not 100% complete but...,"I don't give it a full 5 stars mainly b/c it's missing One, Mysterious Ways, etc,. from the original shows. But it has plenty of extras and is pure joy for any U2 fan. A must have."
1,What is the Aspect Ratio,I would like to buy this DVD but none of the technical literature tells me the aspect ratio. The one I saw in a store was 4:3 (full screen) and I need wide sceen (1.85:1 or higher). Any help?
1,'Fake' stuff going on...,"Beautiful Day is an awesome song, yes? But on this DVD, you can hear 'Bono' doing the backup, while the 'Edge' is actually attempting to fool the audience by lipping Bono's words. If you ask me, it looks retarded. What the hell were they thinking?Anyway, everything else is real. On surround, you have to pay attention to your center speaker, because if you don't 'increase' the volume, the performance drowns out Bono on nearly every 5.1 or DTS setting that you may have. I love U2, and thought that I would be getting a newer and amazing dvd; however, I got the shaft on this one.Do yourself a favor and go purchase yourself a DVD, but make sure its a movie. Ha!"
4,Good history in light of the increasing US-Sino tensions,"As a nuclear power, Communist China will pose a major challenge to United States policy-makers. This expert analysis gives vital background information for understanding and coping with the impending threat. In COMMUNIST CHINA'S STRATEGY IN THE NUCLEAR ERA, Alice Langley Hsieh furnishes a rare insight into Red China's governmental system. Some of the topics discussed and interpreted are: The development of Chinese Communist military thinking and doctrine in response to the implications of nuclear warfare China's decision to develop its own nuclear weapons The effect of China's appreciation of nuclear warfare on her foreign policy-especially on her relations with the Soviet Union What the United States may expect from Communist China as a nuclear power"
2,A few good stories,"Maybe I have completely different tastes than the editors of this anthology, or maybe there just wasn't a whole lot of excellent fantasy published in 2003 but I found Year's Best Fantasy 4 to be a hit and miss affair. Many of the stories are decent but nothing special. A few are pretty bad. Even the usually reliable Neil Gaiman has a misfire with the dull ""Closing Time."" Kelly Link's ""Catskin"" is just plain bizarre (but I suspect it's supposed to be). Among the few excellent stories are the Nebula Award winner ""Basement Magic"" by Ellen Klages, a clever update on the fairy-godmother story;One Thing About the Night"" by Terry Dowling, a creepy ghost story involving a mirrored room; and ""Dragon's Gate"" by Pat Murphy, a well-told high-fantasy quest adventure. There are also some good stories by Lucius Shepard and Terry Bisson. I should also mention the editor's introductions to the stories often contain plot spoilers so I recommend reading those after reading the story."
5,Conan the King,"""The Conan Chronicles, Volume 2: The Hour of the Dragon"" is the second volume in a series collecting all of Robert E. Howard's Conan stories, exactly as he wrote them. Most readers (myself included) are only familiar with the edited versions of these stories made available in the Conan pocketbooks of the seventies and eighties. The writing is lusty, bloody and vibrant. Conan is not for the easily offended.The Conan Chronicles presents the stories chronologically as seen by Conan, not as written. Howard's first Conan story, ""The Phoenix on the Sword"" (included in the middle of this volume) already has Conan as King of Aquilonia. In the opening story, ""Red Nails,"" he is still a pirate on the run, adventuring with Valeria of the Red Brotherhood. The only Conan novel, ""The Hour of the Dragon"" is also included.The stories are intense and captivating. It has been a true pleasure to rediscover Conan as a different, better character than I remember."
5,"Love the band, love the CD",I saw the band on a salsa cruise and had to get the CD. I loved the CD as well. Their music is upbeat and very professional. I am buying it for a friend for Christmas who loves Latin music.
4,Great great smell,"This came on time. The bags were stuffed into the box, but it's a great smell- one of my favorites"
1,The Runaway Princess,This is a silly book. Practically without a credible plot. The dialogs are ridiculous. The main characters are utterly unattractive people that one soon forgets by the time the ending comes. It's a really disappointing read.
2,OK but not great,"This book is fast-paced, which keeps it interesting, but it doesn't suck you in like a really great book can. You'll have no problem at all setting it down to watch TV or cook dinner. The hero & heroine are pleasant, but you never feel that ""connection"" with them. The dialog is laughable, the plot thin, the love story weak and the end only slightly fulfilling. If you must read a Dodd book make it THAT SCANDALOUS EVENING. It is MUCH, MUCH better."
4,A good summer's day read,"In 1816 English orphan Miss Evangeline Scoffield inherits a large sum of money and decides to have one perfect summer. She buys herself new clothes and goes away to france, where she enjoys herself, especially the food.While in France she meets Danior, the prince of Bamina. He claims that she is the princess of Seraphina, his betrothed. Unable to convince him she is not the princess, Evangeline is kidnapped by a determined Danior.On the road to their kingdoms, they are shot at by revolutionaries, Evangeline runs away many, many times and the two fall in love. Will Evangeline ever be able to convince Danior she is not the princess, will he still love her if he realizes she is common?I found this book to be, although a good story, rather predictable. I enjoyed That Scandalous Evening much better."
2,The Runaway Plot?,"What was the point of this book? It did start off a bit interesting, and Danior is definitely appealing, the same can be said of Evangeline. The love scenes were very well written, but the plot, and ending where just too much to swallow. I do not believe a young man of character, let alone a Prince from an important bloodline would behave as Danior does at the end of this novel. And don't even get me started on THE PRINCESS. The half-brother was a disappointment and how can the nun be supposedly what Dodd is trying to sell? And the whole idea of this birthmark which isn't tattoo-ed on but appears on every single female of the lineage is laughable at best. There was some good banter between the couple, and I could have enjoyed it, but for the lack of realism.I enjoy romance, not fantasy."
2,Totally Absurd!,"If you are looking for a fairytale with feminist overtones, this is for you. I have enjoyed several of Dodd's Regency novels but this book is too much of a farce. The concept of an orphan reared by an ancient wise woman who is taught esoteric knowledge from all over the world such as oriental martial arts, treatises on how to climb and descend mountains, scientific knowledge on use of plants and to speak 7 languages in a remote English village who traipses off to the Pyrenees for adventure and is captured by a prince who thinks she is his long lost princess is just too outrageous. I got through it cause I didn't have anything else available but it is definitely not one of her best."
3,Just OK,I've read several of Christina Dodd's books and this one was just OK. The whole mistaken identity and her not being believed seemed a little far-fetched.
2,One needs to develop a taste,"This type of chocolate is supposed to be one of the best for its antioxidant value, but it is rather bitter. Neither my daughter nor I could get through one bar, so I took the remainder of my 12-pack order to school to give to students to share in one on my classes. Even among teenagers who love chocolate, however, the review was quite mixed."
3,summer melt,"Though I have been eating this product for a couple of years and buying it locally, I had thought that buying in bulk would be cheaper and easier. The first time I received the package, most of the chocolate bars had melted significantly. I decided to give it a second try, and though the summer melt took fewer bars, so far every bar has shown signs of beginning the process. I'll probably not give it a third try. Unfortunately, the product is not carried by many vendors around me, so I may be looking for another treat."
1,Excellent chocolate.,The chocolate is excellent but Vitamin Cottage ships spoiled bars. They are chalky and some bars have melted at some point.Endangered Species Species Dark Chocolate is great but Vitamin Cottage should do a better job of caring for the product.Vitamin Cottage also ignored a complaint about the shipment.
5,Excellent Dark Chocolate,"Dark chocolate is very good for you, in moderation. An Endangered Species bar lasts me at least five days as I break off a piece every night! For those having difficulty finding this brand, try Whole Foods, Trader Joe's and Target - they all carry it."
4,not bad but not great,"I generally like Endangered Species, esp the 88% dark. Could use more almonds and cranberries because I can hardly taste it."
2,Definitely not a character study!,"My first problem with this book was trying to keep the characters straight. (They all seemed interchangeable.) But that problem was soon solved, because I didn't care about any of them enough to try to keep track of them. Which left the setting (the best part of the book) and the plot (not exactly spell-binding). I don't plan to read any others in this series."
2,Works Great......,"When it works. I have had consistent problems with this drive, using both firewire and USB. It often does not recognize dvd's that it has burned, and sometimes it will stop reading data halfway through. Also, when this happens, it will disappear from the computer, and you must turn off the drive, disconnect, turn back on the drive, and reconnect. Some firmware definitely needs to be worked on here.When it DOES work, though, it is fast and effective."
2,I guess!!!,"It's a shame when people have enough money to put on a wrestling show and all they could come up with is this garbage. I will say this, that fall from Vic Grimes was amazing! It was even more amazing that he survived that and continued to wrestle. New Jack is definately a sick MF'er, but Vic Grimes deserves major props for this as far as being hardcore. Other than that and the little part that showed Veronica Caine and Lizzy Borden (who were pornstars at that time) naked, the rest of the show was horrible! I still haven't figured out why they would book a match between Webb and GQ Money for their World Title! My 4 year son would beat the sh@t out of GQ Money easy. It's tragic that the world title of that wrestling organization has no clout anywhere. You know you have a horrible show when the crowd boos and yells ""boring"" the whole show. I think I have made my point."
2,XPW Sucks,"Thank god this company shut down. The only reason i bought this DVD was for the scaffold match between New Jack and Vic Grimes since I am a very big fan of Jack whom i've met and is a very interesting person to talk to but the match itself sucked in my opinion the second reason was the buck naked match in which the lights go off when the girls get stripped down but they do atleast try to make up for it with doing a sort of striptease with the two ladies afterwards(available only on the dvd or video) but that in itself is only worth watching once and its pretty dull after. Dont waste your time on this, and ECW DVD would be a much better buy."
1,What What & what's up With This ( Because It's Not ECW ),... they cut the matches And The Crama Angels arevery bad. ...THIS SO CALLED EXTREME WANNA BE WRESTLING. THERE IS ONLY ONE GOODMATCH AT THE END. ( SORRY IF ANYTHING IS MISS SPELLED BUT I HAVE A LD) SO I HOPE YOU CAN READ THIS ) THANK YOU.
1,Utter Rubbish,A classic case of turning a silk purse into a sow's ear. What should have been a literate and probably humorous discussion of interesting and absorbing subject was presented with all the style and panache of a fourth grader's badly done class project. Even Andy Warhol would have blenched at the crass indifference with which this book was crafted.
5,"Me Like ""BoB"". ""BoB"" Good!","Tired of those ""christian"" reliogion that demand 10% of you income and offer 0% return on investment?Well, this Church is the Church for you! ""BoB' set the REAL storey of the human/yeti history of the world that the ""Conspiracy"" has hidden from us! ""Bob"" will show you how to unlock you lost Yeti Powers.

2,overrated,"This was the first book I bought from Amazon, back around '96. I'd read and heard so much about SubGenius from friends and newsfroups that I felt I needed to see it for myself. I'd already read the Principia Discordia and loved it.Well, the Book of the SubGenius is no Principia. The Principia is basically a very simple, fun look at things through a specific Big Joke. SubGenius' Big Joke is complicated and uninteresting, making the rest of its observations much the same.I'm glad I picked it up and that I can catch a lot of slacky references, but unless you just want a grounding in SubGenius jargon, this book is a bit of a waste of time."
5,Can Kerry be trusted? I don't think so!,"The economy is currently growing at it's fastest rate in over 20 years. If Kerry becomes President (God forbid!) that will quickly make a U-Turn.Kerry wants to raise taxes that is no secret. Those taxes will affect everyone, not just the wealthy. He also has some crazy plans on Medicare that will affect the elderly. Certaintly the elderly deserve better!Want to know what Kerry is really up to? Then read The Many Faces of Kerry by David Bossie. From what I'm hearing, Unfit for Duty which is coming out next week also has some revealing information and facts about Kerry's not so pleasant past."
2,More misses than hits.,"While the book hits the mark when it comes to criticizing Kerry for his work with the Intelligence committee (or, better put, his non-attendance of public meetings), it fails in many other areas. My suggestion is that those who read the book go to http://www.factcheck.org/ which is bi-partisan resource to help determine what are the facts and what is disinformation."
1,Another Smear Job,"This is another smear job by supposedly ""honest"" researcher David Bossie who is actually a very well-funded GOP operative. This book is nothing more than a rehashing of all of the smears and lies that we have seen from the right this election year.Bossie has no shame -- and more importantly -- no credibility."
5,Why did I wait??,"I have loved Ms Feehan for years and just never thought to pick up her single titles. Im so sorry I waited. This story was wonderful. It has all the elements of a great Feehan novel, the characters, all of them, were so great with so much chemistry. Even though it was on the shorter end and not all the details were fully developed none of the characters were lacking. This was really her at her best and maybe better bc the story stands alone and cant be tainted by past of future novels in a series of inconsistencies that sometimes arise in her series works. Fast read but great!! Well worth the wait."
5,a very gothic christmas,"great! what a great surpise.i only hope they have more.sorry i missed it years ago,snice it 2008."
4,Melanie George shines!,"Christine Feehan's story AFTER THE MUSIC is mysterious and dark, but lacks the explosive passion her DARK series books have. I found myself wishing a Carpathian would show up and liven things up. A three star story - must read for fans.Melanie George's story LADY OF THE LOCKET was the best story in this anthology. If you have a weakness for Scottish men, then you will love this story. Rachel falls for the image of Duncan MacGragor from a paining in the castle of Glengarren. Then one stormy night, Duncan comes back through time to solve the mystery of the castle and his death. What is sad is I know some people skipped this story just to read Christine's story only. They don't know what they missed! A four star story - give it a try."
1,sucky,"Man, this thing is wayyy overpriced! And the arcs aren't very articulatid. This thing is worthless,and you shouldnt waste yer money on it!!!!!!!1"
4,Loves!,"I really like these shoes! They are super comfortable and true to size. They only draw back is that the bow in the back (that keeps the shoe on) must be untied to slip them on and it is difficult tying it once it is on your foot. Other than that, abeautifully crafted footwear that I can not wait to wear for prom"
3,Very used,"Item said was in good conditions, but it was in bad conditions. Bended pages, lots or mark on many pages and the cover also was very bended."
5,""" Ice to see you. ""","Toys are cool.The Simpsons are cool(they were, anyway).McBain is cool.A Simpsons toy of McBain is very cool.How it breaks down:FUN--5 starsJust like the Moe's Tavern set, a must for fans of the character.EDUCATIONAL--4 starsIt teaches us that foolish foriegn body builders with thick accents and limited acting ability can become very, very rich. Only in america.DURABILITY--4 starsIf you slam it on the pavement hard enough it'll break, but other than that...OVERALL--5As mentioned before, it's cool."
1,A bit out of date.,"Do note that most of the favorable reviews are quite old. As a recent newbie to Bermuda, I can tell you that in 2012, most houses now have heat and a/c (be sure to check before you buy/rent of course) and that would seem to eliminate much of the drama that Tracey faced. And yes, there are bugs here in Bermuda. And humidity. It isn't entirely unlike the Southern United States and especially Florida in those regards. See how I managed to explain that in a couple of sentences? Took Tracey a whole book to do the same, with lots of description of tears and taking to her bed in fits of depression/exhaustion. You may like reading about all of that. But the overly dramatic writing style of this book was not at all my cup of tea."
4,"A funny, informative read",I read this book when a family member moved there and found it very interesting and funny. My family member loved it and found many useful tips in the book for living in Bermuda.
2,2 stars is generous,"A productivity killer. I cannot count the minutes I've pissed away trying to get this thing out of a state whereby Caps Lock is seemingly on. Not to mention the cumulative seconds waiting for it to switch from one machine to the other. Thankfully, I didn't buy this thing, but inherited it from my boss. This is what ulcers are made of."
4,not bad,"this switch isnt all too bad, words fine with my 2 button wheel mouse, only thing is, i have to use two keyboards, but much better than having to use two mice two monitors, etc etc. not a bad price for it either"
4,Satisfaction,"I had PS2 switch and now for my new USB mouse and keyboard, I bought this switch.The description to me clearly suggested that it is fully USB compliant. After buying it I read Customer reviews. The reviews scared me as it seemed the hot keys on my keyboard will not work and my MS 4 button optical mouse with scroll wheel will function only like a two button mouse and no scrolling. I also read the data sheeet from Hawking website. There they mention that this switch works with most keyboards and mouse. This made me feel that I had bought the wrong thing. However on receipt of the switch, I found that with proper connections, most of the hot keys work and all the 4 buttons plus the scroll wheel work. I am happy having bought this at a discount at Amazon Marketplace."
1,missed opportunity,"this book had the chance to privide some interesting insights into the subject, covering ground that has been largely untread. instead, what we get is a litany of sexual histories for 20 or so men that the author has scrounged up from 2 east coast locales, with precious little insight as to their roles as tops or bottoms. curiously, several interviewees seem to be under the impression that they have responded to a sex ad and that their sex talk will be a prelude to an erotic encounter with the author. which would be fine if anyone had anything interesting to say beforehand.the book's ending is as abrupt as it is welcome. there is no attempt to summarize and digest anything we've been told. in contrast to another reviewers comments, this is about the last book i would recommend to someone just coming out. i had hoped for an interesting but sleazy summer read. well, all i can say is that it wasn't too interesting."
4,Entertaining and Informative,"I give this book high kudos for exploring a topic that has always been here-to-fore only an elephant in the ""gay"" room. The topic is not so much that gay men will identify themselves (or each other) as top, bottom, or versatile, but why. It's an intriguing question, and the answers revealed in this piece are equally fascinating. I must admit, I bought this book mostly for entertainment purposes, and I am happy to report I was not disappointed there, of course, it never hurts that I learned something too (about myself)."
2,Product Maybe Great - Vendor Dubious,The vendor sent a product that was inferior (cheaper model $50.00) than the one advertised. They were good to refund my money but this created an inconvenience and delay. Again the product was probably great but I wonder if the vendor was playing the old bait and switch game.Bought a higher rated product sorry Pentax.
4,Ony a small bit of filling....,"I adore Mochi, and this mega pack is fantastic. It does stay fresh for a long time, and the rice cake is nice a gooey. The only complaint I have is that the filling is very minimal... only a tiny bit in every one. Still tho, I ate the entire box and will be ordering again."
3,Didn't like all the flavors,"I ordered these to try something new, so I don't have much experience with Mochi. I liked some of the flavors, but not everything in this box."
3,"Came stale, Amazon was fast with refund","My son and I love this brand of mochi, and we were glad to find this particular selection on Amazon. Unfortunately, it came so stale that it was inedible. Amazon refunded the price in a flash.Clearly, judging from the other reviews, a lot of people have gotten good shipments. We were just unlucky, I guess.We trying again with other sellers here on Amazon."
1,Mochi Rice Cake Cookie Sampler past expiration,"Item arrived promptly and well packaged but upon opening had a rancid smell. Checked box (back side) and noticed ""Start Shipping 10/18/2010"" 2010! It arrived November 16, 2011! Would have liked to received fresher product. Will be returning! I think most people who disliked or gave bad reviews probably received an ""expired"" product as well. This was not a positive experience."
2,Monotonous,"Although the outside varies, these mochi pretty much taste the same--kinda like old peanut butter. Do yourself a favor and buy the single flavor mochi in the plastic wrap--they taste as advertised: melon=melon, adzuki=adzuki, and so forth."
3,Mochi by mail,"This is the first time ordering online, usually when i get mochi i have to drive a few hours to Dallas. While its so much easier to get it delivered right at your door, its just not the same getting it from a fresh bakery.This has some unique flavors i have to say. I liked all, except for the sesame. It tasted like coffee to me. I would have liked the mochi to be a bit bigger, they are served in miniature cupcake cups. The ones i'm used to are about as big as my palm. Only other thing i should mention is they just dont have much filling."
2,Not great,I didn't like it very much. They didn't taste great and there wasn't much filling inside. This is mostly balls of glutinous rice. Not much flavor. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't great. Mostly bland. I wouldn't buy it again. I want to find some better asian snacks than this.
2,not my cup of tea,"I bought these because my daughter is completely infatuated with Japan and I thought it would be cool to try something different from there. We didn't like them. They have three layers to them. The outer layer is just a powdery covering, the second layer is rice that has been prepared to the consistency of a boiled egg white, the third/middle layer is gooey like pudding. But it was packaged nicely and if you like this sort of thing or grew up in that part of the world I'm sure they would be perfect."
2,Weakest title in the series (thus far),"Having read all of the Mustang Sally mysteries, I have to say I found this one to be the least interesting. Perhaps the pattern is becoming too familiar to me: Sally encounters a dangerous situation. Sally's friends warn her not to get involved. Sally gets involved anyway, endangering her life and her relationship with Hawk. Then she solves the mystery and everybody lives happily ever after, sort of. But if you've read all of the others, you might as well read this one too. It just seems with each successive novel the author has less and less original to say. Part of the reason I think this one is less engaging than the others, is that Sally has much less interaction with the Langham family. Those characters are much more involved in the other books in the series."
3,"Not bad, but not Woody Allen's greatest.","Predictable, but fun. Not bad, but not Woody Allen's greatest. Pretty actors (well, except Woody). Would recommend for light viewing."
4,Good vII,Liked it - it was a good movie to follow up the first. Good story line and good special effects.
1,Horrible remake/sequel,Lousy horror/porn movie. Madsen and Helgenberger needed a paycheck. Glad I only skimmed through this on fast forward online. Waste.
1,What a disappointment!,"I was truly looking forward to this book but what a disappointment! Brock Yates has become a parody of himself. His dialog shifts back and forth from hacknyed fifties slang to current hip phrases like ""hooking up"". Well known nicknames (such as Eddie Kuzma aka Eddie Kazoom, not Zazoom) are butchered. Yates politics and opinions are freely interchangable as facts. Altogether this ""Faction"" (his term) is just poor fiction. All of Burt Levy's ""The Last Open Road"" series are far more illuminating and much more fun."
2,Name Dropping,2/3 of the book was devoted to Bill Vukovich which was tolerable. The other third was about the 1955 LeMans race and James Dean. It seemed that Yates would frequently concoct situations to have everything fit together. By the end of the book his constant name dropping got to be too much and I skipped through the last 40 pages in about a half an hour.
1,Re-gifter!,"I recieved this book as a X-Mas gift. RE-GIFTER. Brock Yates' writing reads to me like that of a fellow who has too much going on and decided at the last minute to add ""write this book"" to the list.There's a few decent passages, but so much of this seems read as bland, hurried text. I own it, but I sort of wish I didn't."
5,Probably one of the best CD of Brazilian Music ever,"I completely disagree with the previous review. I am so hooked on this music that I listen to it every single day, at home, in the car and I love dancing to it.I have the Millenium CD and I will most certainly buy others since I don't think this is a waste of money AT ALL!!"
1,Think one more time before buying,"I'm advising you to think very well before buying this record, otherwise you will regret doing that. There are a lot of much better artists in Brazilian music. If you like ""axe music"", try Daniela Mercury or Banda Eva, but anything you buy of this group is pure waste of money!"
1,Don't Buy it!,This is the worst book I have ever bought.It has missed spelled words and is poorly written.My Five year old could have written a better book about our Bassett Hound. It has no information in it worth paying for.
1,Title is misspelled!,I was looking for basset hound books to add to my library. I'm not sure how a book was published that has a misspelled title! Basset has only 1 T. Obviously the author didn't do the research they claimed. I think I will pass on this book.
1,Don't Buy this!,This is a waste of money. I am completely shocked that it was ever published. Anyone who reads this and believes it will need therapy!
3,Lacks detail,"I enjoyed reading the piece. However, I already largely agree with Friedman. If I didn't, nothing in it would have changed my mind. This essay would make a great foreward for a real book on the topic. However, unless you're looking for a soundbite quality summary, I wouldn't spend money on this. I got mine in one of the 4 for 3 book deals, but still wasted my free book on this."
2,Just a short essay by Milton,"Just a short essay by Milton, save your money and buy one of his books. I wish I paid attention more when I was ordering it!"
3,Know what you're getting...,The message is of course clear concise and right on point. However I mistakenly thought I was buying a larger novel ful of essays not a pamphlet of one essay. Be sure you understand this before plunking down your five dollars.
4,"Short, but well done.","This book was short, but was very well done. I dont know that I would buy new if given the chance, but still a well done essay."
3,hum,its not a fully big book its a little flat booklet it not in your desubetion on it in your way of telling people its a booklet not a book Thank u
1,This Pamphlet is Horrid...,"I love Milton Friedman, but he was 81 years old when he wrote this very brief little essay (18 small pages, big font size). Frankly, there is more information about Friedman and his ideas in his wikipedia entry. His arguments are good for an 80 year old, but strike me as having all the intellect and thought as any RNC staffer...I do not recommend this pamphlet."
3,Circle of Quilters,"The overlap of the characters is interesting, but it doesn't flow as well as her previous works. I have especially enjoyed the women and their interactions in this series, and this one lacks some of the cohesive qualities of the other books. Still a good read, and prepares us for the next in the series."
5,A great addition to the series!,"I have to admit that I had been rather disappointed with Chiaverini's last few installments in this series, but this one was better than ever! I might even say the best yet. We get a lot of great new characters while still retaining the old ones somewhat. The addition of new characters will really help develop further books as well. While it was like starting over with each new character, you really got to know each one and hopefully Chiaverini will continue to develop all of them in the next books. All the characters were so great that it was hard to know who to root for for the job.Another great addition to this story was Russ and the male viewpoint. I really look forward to seeing more development of the trials of male quilters in a predominantly female hobby.Definitely a book to go get and devour!"
5,haven't finished listening yet,"But so far, it's great. The characters are filled with so much life and I've been to the festivals and wish I could go to that retreat. Dying to find out who they hire... don't spoil it for me!"
4,Another enjoyable entry in the series...,"Although the segmented method of introducing the main character's stories into the plot was a little frustrating at first, I soon got into the swing and found myself rushing to the end to see who would ""win."" I've enjoyed these novels quite a bit, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy the next one if it comes. If you are a fan of this series, you'll like this entry."
2,Disappointed-,"I purchased this as a bargain paperback and perhaps that skews my review. The quality of the paper in the book is very poor. Based upon all the 5 star reviews, I was hoping to really enjoy this book, but I found it hard to get into. The most interesting part was with the history of the quilt, so at least I learned something."
5,"New quilters, new stories","This is a novel in the Elm Creek Quilts series, which chronologically follows the events in The Master Quilter and is the ninth book by date of publication. I liked this fresh take as we are introduced to 5 potential candidates for the 2 positions opening up with Summer going to graduate school and Judy taking a job outside the area. While we don't see much of the original group besides in the interviews, I really liked getting a background story for each of the applicants and how the stories had interlapping sections for the interviews. It was fascinating to see how each one got into quilting and there different styles and techniques. I found it hard to decide which would be their 2 top choices and the decision was made in the final chapter. I look forward to seeing how the new people fit in when I read the next book that is in the contemporary timeline of the story."
2,Disappointing,"This was my least favorite novel of the Elm Creek series. Two of the original quilters are leaving and the others interview people to take their places. Each chapter is about one of the interviewees. I found it difficult to get through. The only person I enjoyed reading about was Russ, the lone, male quilter. The others, especially Anna and her boyfriend and Karen and her husband, were more extreme caricatures, and annoying. And main character Diane, who is annoying and rude on a good day, is vicious here. She has her ""reason"" but her actions just serve to make the reader angry. I've enjoyed these novels, so this one disappointed me."
1,Pinstripes on a Red Sox Uniform!?,"Pinstripes on a Red Sox uniform!? FAILThis may be cute but if the father of the intended recipient is a real Red Sox fan, do not buy. He will wonder why there are Yankee pinstripes on his Red Sox uniform."
1,Great idea... Bad design... Really bad support.,"I bought this product to replace an older card reader that had failed. I was very happy when I plugged it in and Windows automatically recognized it without any problems whatsoever... Until I read the fine print...This ""universal"" memory reader is not so universal after all. It can't read an SD card larger than 128 MB or a Multimedia Card larger than 64 MB. This is a serious flaw with SD cards up to 256+ and MMC's at 128MB. I send an email to Hawking asking if there was an upgrade and recieved the following response:""Sorry, it is not support more than 64m MMC card, and more than 128M SD card.No upgrade now.Best Regards,Hawking Technology(N)""Stay away from this card reader. I am returning it and going with the Sandisk Imagemate 6-in-1 reader model #SDDR-86-07If there was a rating lower than 1 star, this product would get it."
3,Visionary Film,Proffesor Stiney has a unique vision and perception of experimental film. This text has some interesting ideas and good points but I believe somewhat limited in scope. I would recomend this text as a good primer for many interested in avante garde and experimental film and video.
5,love them!,"i've been wearing these shoes for 4 years. i wear then pretty much constantly in the fall and winter. not only have they held up remarkably well through pretty rough treatment, but they are Very comfortable and look great with jeans or cords."
3,"Great recipes, homely book","I can't disagree with anything the previous reviewers have said; this is a great collection of lobster lore and recipes. However, the production values of this book fall far short of the premise, the cover, and the lobster itself. After you get past the cover, you will find cheap paper, no graphics or photos. It looks like it could be an extension service cookbook typed on a simple typewriter. I would not recommend this as a gift book if you are trying to impress someone."
3,get pop songs but weak vocals,"He writes great songs full of melody and infectious hooks, but his voice is loathsome. I'm sure it's difficult to have someone else sing the songs that you've written about how you feel, but The Rocket Summer I'm sure would be more popular with a better vocalist."
2,Awful - almost.,"Do You Feel? Feel what? The migraine I get after listening to this album? Yes. Oh boy was this hard to listen to. If Bryce Avary (aka The Rocket Summer) was willing to turn over vocal duties to someone else, he'd be doing the world a favor. Instrumentally, this album is cool: it's varied and energetic. Nothing groundbreaking, but it's stuff I could totally get into if I didn't have to listen to the vocals. Oh well... maybe there's an instrumental version out there somewhere! Despite my feelings about the album, Do You Feel seems to have a pretty strong fan base, particularly among Christian rock fans. Time will tell how well this album does, but I guess I can't recommend it. Maybe check out some of the tunes and see if it's your sort of thing... but don't run out and buy this one without being sure."
1,No comparison to later work,"For those of you who have listened and enjoyed the 1998 release Souls Core and have also been fortunate to pick up 1996's Egg Shells, then this CD will greatly disappoint you. Recorded in 1992, his musical style and singing/songwriting approach was basically not yet developed into what has become a tremendous talent. This is almost like listening to a John Denver CD.(sorry) My suggestions is to not bother and purchase Eggshells if you are looking for another Shawn Mullins CD to compliment Souls Core. Eggshells, with tremendous songs like ""Where's Johnny,"" ""Joshua,"" ""Darbys Castle"" and an acoustic version of ""Shimmer"" will rival anything Mullins puts out. It just wasn't there yet in 1992."
1,I would not recommend this book to any serious artist,"I would not recommend this book to any artist that is serious about learning the program in any useful way. This writer is not an artist, and doesn't understand the fundamentals of good design. It is poorly organized and in a few instances simply inaccurate. I would recommend 3D Character Animation instead."
3,The best book around right now,"I have searched all over the internet for books on SoftImage. This is the best one for someone who is just starting to learn from zero with no background in the field. Because SoftImage itself is such a complex software no book that's less than 800 pages can explain every detail in it and every technique step by step. So, I found myself needing much more than what this book could offer me very fast. Some of its modeling tutorials are not extensive enough. (Like how to model a face or a body). Nor does it offer any insight on how to model a tree. Also the particle system is not sufficiently talked about here. He swiftly drifts through the mental ray section in a few pages. In brief, this book will teach you the basics of SoftImage but it will not give you much beyond that."
3,A must for beginners,"This book is a must for the rookies, however, it is a bit weak for experienced 3D guys. In my opinion writers hide some rare knowledge from readers, and it is easy to feel it if you are not a beginner. CD ROM is really dissapointing..."
2,Where are the clips?,"These lights are very bright and look like retro C7 bulbs. We love them, except for the fact that the manufacturer does not supply clips on the base for clipping the bulb to the tree. Out looking for clips now."
5,Kindred Sisters,"Excellent. I borrowed the book from our church library and after reading it, I knew I must have my own copy. It is a wonderful Bible study source."
2,Too expensive with no guarantee,"I only took it for 1 month and saw no improvement. I know that it says to take for 3 months. At $ 50 a month that is $ 150. If everyone who tries it pays $ 150 that is a good profit for Viviscal. It doesn't need to work, they made their money and will keep making money from new people trying it for 3 months."
2,hair product,"I didn't realize when I ordered a month supply that I would have to use Viviscal for six months before seeing results. That would make a large investment of time and money without any guarantee of results. Also, the instructions recommend to take it twice a day, so you have to remember to take it again after dinner. I, for one, sometimes forgets that second pill! Only use if you are prepared to make that commitment. Joyce4"
1,Don't see a difference unfortunately,"I've been taking 2 pills a day for the last 4 weeks. Not sure if that isn't enough time to see a difference, but i've seen none."
3,Taking for a year with little change,"I starting taking Viviscal last January (year ago). Now I was not experiencing any significant hair loss but I've always had a little more than normal fallage which is what I was hoping to improve with this. I think I've noticed a bit of thickening when I look at my hair line but there is no dramatic change with the number of hairs falling out, length or texture (and my nails have not changed either - as some post). No side effects though (weight gain or headaches). Deciding if I want to continue with this..."
3,It works ok,"I do see new hair growth and my skin and nails look better, but I don't like if you stop taking it hair falls out a lot."
2,Beware of Itchy rash,"I tired this product and after 25 tablets broke out in a red itchy rash on my neck and chest. I tried benedrel and cortisone creams but after a couple more pills it worsened and I broke out in large red blotches on my face and neck. I called the manufacturer and they say that if you have an allergy to any seafood you shouldn't take it. I am allergic to clams. Also there is sulfur in it which I am allergic to also. So , beware, proper packaging with warnings should be included with this product."
4,This stuff is great!,"I am a 47 year old female who loses copious amounts of hair daily. I shed like my huskey dog normally! I started taking Viviscal and by the end of my 60 supply I noticed that I wasn't losing as much hair in the shower every morning. I did nothing else different; just took this product. I normally find that products don't really live up to expectations, but this one did! I am purchasing more."
1,Not working for me,"I was excited about viviscal extra strength. Have been using it since January 2012. The first 3 months i was taking 2 pills a day. One in the morning and 1 in the evening. After March, I start taking 1 pill a day. I can't even find the words to express my disappointment - my hair is exactly the same now in December as it wa in January :( Very disappointing......I am not sure if I received the real pills or some fake ones but I have no results at all."
2,Product to Help with Hair Growth,"The rating was chosen only because I had an allergic reaction to the pills. I'd read and heard many wonderful things regarding this product. Even Cynthia Nixon, of Sex In The City, when interviewed on TV, remarked how this product helps so much to re-grow her hair after a starring role on Braodway required her to have a ""clean shaven head"". The Seller was very understanding when I explained and kindly refunded my entire purchase price. Thank you!"
4,Great stuff !,"Ok first off I would like to say that I am a real person and that I have no affiliation with the company. I have been using this product for about 2 months now and my hair and nails have improved so much. 3 months ago I had black hair and now I have blonde so you can imagine the damage that it has been through but.... my hair dresser is amazed by how healthy my hair has stayed and how long it has grown. She is constantly asking me what I use and that has been the only thing I have changed. Now I will say that I do use very good quality shampoos, conditioners and masks so I'm sure that helps as well, but I personally know I have seen a great improvement. Not everything works for everyone but just because some people don't like it doesn't mean it doesn't work for others. I say give it a try as long as there are no medical conditions and ask a doctor if you're not sure. Most vitamins, if not all, are not FDA approved."
5,WHOOOOOPI,I am thrilled.......stopped my hair from falling out !!!!!! It's a two month supply which u take daily and r good to go.
3,Viviscal Vitamins,"The seller delivered the item as promised and promptly. I don't think the ""dietary supplement"" was anything overly great. They smelled and tasted like a natural supplement. Personally, I did not notice any difference or improvement and for the price you could just get a good multivitamin which might help more."
4,Look now Mom!!!,I had read many reviews and articles about this product. I have used Biotin as a supplement that helps somewhat. This product is much better in my opinion. I definitely see a difference and will continue to use in the future. Strongly recommend.
3,Viviscal,"When I first started taking Viviscal my hair did feel much stronger and softer but my skin didn't react well to taking the vitamins. I didn't take them for long enough to see any length result in my hair, but I did notice a positive change in texture and the feel of my hair. If you don't have sensitive skin like I do, I would say it's worth it to try them."
1,nothing special,I know better than to watch a TV commercial and buy something a TV star is selling. But I did it. I was concerned about loosing hair. It didn't work.
2,Very little improvement after 8 months,I've been taking this product on a regular basis for almost 9 months. I've noticed my nails growing faster but there is little or no sign of my hair improving. So I give it two stars
3,Not as effective as I had hoped,"I have been taking Viviscal for about 8 months. The effect, if any, is not obvious. I am not sure I will continue after finishing what I have. I took Hairmega 3-1 before. It worked better than Viviscal, but only for about six months. I wish I could find something really working for me."
4,Great results,"Got this product for my husband who was going bold. After two months of use, his hair looks a lot fuller and thicker. His body hair has grown out two so and we take this as a good sign. I totally recommend it."
5,It works.,"I bought this because I have always had very fine, curly hair that is hard to grow and when it does grow, it will only grow to a certain length and just stop. It is very frustrating. I am 37 years old and I have seen my hair go through different stages, especially during pregnancy, and most recently after my hysterectomy. I have been using this product for 2 weeks now and I am already seeing some new growth and fullness in my hair. I plan on taking this for quite a while in hopes that my hair will thicken and grow. I'm thrilled that I already see positive changes and I know it is working! Also, my hair is no longer dry and brittle. It actually gets oily, which it has never done! I highly recommend this if you are struggling with your hair like I am!"
2,Didn't work,"I used this faithfully for ten months. My hair has been thinning a little for 2 years. I did not really notice any thicker hair, possibly a little???? but not much if at all."
2,"Not worth the money, honestly.","My typical hair growth is about 3/4 inch a month.There was no actual growth as far as length goes, but I did notice that my hair was much, much more fuller. I was dissapointed with the product."
2,Doesn't work.,Maybe it's too soon to tell but I've noticed no changes and must say it doesn't work as well as advertised. Really too bad for such an expensive product.
3,New to the product,I have only been taking this product for 6 weeks. My understanding is that you have to take it for 6 months to judge results.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE VIVISCAL HAIR PILLS!,"It will give you a rash. DO NOT BUY IT! I only took two pills and the next day I had a really bad itchy rash on my neck and ears. I didn't change anything in my daily routine except for the viviscal pills. And then when I tried to return them they didn't let me. Which I understand because it says they don't do returns on open products but they should have warned the buyers that it causes rashes. And I'm not the only one. If you type into google ""viviscal gives rashes"" you'll be surprised at how many people had the same reaction some even worse. My skin is very clear so it was very noticeable the very next day. SAVE YOUR MONEY! P.s besides the actual product being horrible, the delivery was on time lol ^.~"
2,very confusing directions,"Directions are very confusing. Box says one thing , insert says another. Still have not started on these till I figure it out."
3,too early,Instructions state product must be taken for a period of months before seeing results- I have not used the product yet for a month.
2,Try Back in about another month for results too early now...,Now it hard right now because I just started the product I will say that I use this a few years back and it work pretty good.Its really the same as Nourkrin tables...You should ask for my ratings in about a month..So right now it only gets 2-stars to early to tell
1,Rip Off,"Viviscal tablets area complete waste of hard earned cash. I suspect they are nothing more than Brewers Yeast tablets, they smell, taste and look exactly the same. I saw no improvement in my hair growth or thickness at all. Jennie Bond professes to take Viviscal and says she now has luxurious locks - well I don't believe that because if you watch her on Cash in the Attic on TV you can see from certain camera shots that her hair is very thin and is back combed and bouffed up to try and disguise her thinning crown. Do yourself a favour and keep your money in your purseElaine - Cheshire"
3,Does it really work?,purchased it because I saw it on the Dr. Oz show....I don't know if it really works...but there s no harm in taking it.
5,Good for healthy hair and skin,"I have been using this product for several years for my hair and skin, and am pleased with it. Health from the Sun is a trusted brand that has not disappointed me.The recommended dosage for a 500mg softgel is two or three times a day. I have found that it is more economical to buy a 1000 mg 6O softgel bottle and take one 1000 mg softgel a day.Shop for price. This product is available in both 500mg 180 count and 1000 mg 60 count on the internet for substantially less than the current price on Amazon."
5,The Truth be told,"For all you newbies out there, this is the book that men are made of, my suggestion is to memorize it then read it again, aka. ya newbie."
1,Looks awful,"We were quite disappointed with this product. They arrived quickly enough but when we opened the box and viewed one of cigars it looked just awful. One can only describe it as mottled in the extreme. We then opened a second and third cigar and find they were all the same. Certainly not something we would want to pass out. The question was, 'could we safely eat these?'. We each had one and while they tasted good enough for what they represented, and we are still alive to report on the them, we still felt that by looks alone it would turn folks off. Was this a one off box? We don't know but have no intention of finding out. There are other sources for the same product."
4,does the job for a good price,bought this a while ago and it it working as designed. on some connections it's bit tight but other than that it's a good price and works well.
5,Love this book,"I love this book, gorgeous, colourful and simple pictures and the textures are amazing. My son received this as gift when he was born and has been playing with it since he was 5 months old when he played with it for 3 hours on a plane. He loves the oyster. He is 11 months old now and pulls the book out of his toy box at least 3 times a week. I'm ordering some more for our next plane ride."
1,Not the original squishy turtle,"This is not the original squishy turtle. I have the original fluffy chick and fuzzy bee (each with 8 character pages and made out of cloth/cotton type fabric). This book was surprising as it only had 6 character pages and was made out of a cheap nylon type fabric. The pages were thin and crinkly and the book seemed to be missing a lot by cutting out 2 pages and using cheaper materials. This is a really sneaky thing to do while marketing it as the same book. I am glad I have the original chick and bee books that I got from a consignment store. If they were like this I wouldn't have bought them. I sent this one back- its not even worth having and it's annoying that the company tried to be sly about it and not mention that there are TWO versions of this book, with this being the newer cheap version."
5,Great book for babies!,I love reading to my little boy and this book is perfect for kids who are interested in books but too little to read. The soft cover is great and there are so many interesting things for him to touch on each pages. I would highly recommend this book for any baby!
4,LOVE it,"My 6-month old daughter likes to eat her board books, so I purchased several cloth books for her to chew on instead. This is one of her favorites. It has rhyming verses inside that I can read to her, and each friendly-looking sea creature has a different texture for her little hands to touch. She particularly likes the whale because of the ribbon coming from the spout. The crinkly paper in the cover is also fun for her to play with."
5,One of baby's faves,"My baby loves this book. The turtle on the cover makes a wonderful crunching sound, and he finds it hilarious. Fun for reading AND chewing :)"
4,Great for little hands (and mouths),Our 5 month old enjoys grabbing at and chewing this book. The rhymes are cute but it would be nice if there was an actual story involved.
4,Good but Fuzzy Bee and Friends book is better,"I bought this book and Fuzzy Bee and Friends book together. My baby loves animals (9 month) and she enjoys both books. However I prefer Fuzz bee. The reason is that the color of this book are pretty much the same - blue green etc. I would say lack of variation and enough visual stimulation.On the contrary, Fuzzy Bee book provides several vivid color as background and those animals in Fuzzy Bee is more popular to me. So if you have to pick one book, Fuzzy Bee is a better bet."
5,BEST CLOTH BOOK!!!,"This is the best of this series of cloth books. I returned both Fuzzy Bee and Fluffy Chick because their rhymes and textures are far inferior to those of Squishy Turtle. My daughter loves this book, and she doesn't seem to tire of the fun and clever rhymes when I read it to her, nor the interesting textures of the sea life within its soft pages. If you only buy one of these cloth books, you definitely should get this one."
4,super sweet book,I really like this book and so do my daughters. It has been in our family for years now and still looks like new. My girls (2 and 8 months) fight over it on a regular basis.
1,Rhymes seemed insipid,"Fuzzy Bee has better rhymes and textures. The turtle wasn't even squishy. Five out of the 7 pages have the same satiny material, including a tiny piece of ribbon which shows water coming out of the whale hole. I expected more subtle and enchanting rhymes. It has the same elements as Fuzzy Bee so my 2 month still enjoys it."
2,Not so great,"I did not think this toy was as great as all the reviews indicated. It is just a fabric book. No bright fun colors, not much variance in the coloring. Its fine but I would not buy it again nor would i recommend."
4,Fun book,"Book is fun for our son, he really likes it. My only complaint is black text on a dark background makes one page hard to read."
1,Book contains high levels of lead,"While looking for a good cloth book for my baby to play with and chew on I came across the many great reviews for this book. Sounded great until I saw that it had been found to have high levels of toxins in it. Please see for yourself at [...]To be fair I have not read the book. I'm sure its cute, but my baby will NOT be playing with this or putting it in his mouth!"
1,Buyers beware! Amazon ships SHORT version of the book!,"I had this book with 8 characters in it. My son loved it. I bought this book along with three other books in the same series by Priddy as gifts for my friend. When I received the shipment, three out of four books were the SHORT version ones with 6 characters in them. The quality of the cloth is poor and thin. Very disappointed about the shipment. REX and friends is the only one ""LONG"" version book I received. It is very easy to tell that the long version book has much better quality. I called a couple of local book stores to check the availability of the long version books; it seems that the short version of this series is everywhere now...."
5,Orphan Trains,"I had never heard of the Orphan Trains until I visited the Little White House in Warm Springs, GA. This book provides the history of adopting out children. The whole concept of giving away ones children due to financial hardships is hard to grip, but this book provides a look from the child's eye to the situation."
4,Another potentially decent starter rocket for kids,"While nothing to write home about from a structural standpoint, the AstroSat LSX is an good choice for small field flying, especially if you're entertaining a bunch of kids. The AstroSat LSX unloads a couple of streamer-recovered ""satellites"" along with the parachute, and the kids go wild. The only problem with the rocket is the less than durable fin can/engine mount. However, when the inevitable destruction of this part finally occurs, the nose cone can be scavenged to ""clone"" any number of cool classic Estes rockets."
3,Ok for the price,"I am a hairstylist and used these clippers for about a month before I noticed they weren't cutting as well as at first. They are light and not super loud, but if you do a lot of clipper cutting regularly, spend the money on a better set. For the occasional cut or for home use, these clippers will do just fine."
5,Awesome clippers,"Awesome clippers! Gets the job done with little struggle. Other clippers with certain hair types would require you to go over the same area to get your hair at the level you want it, but these bad boys only require you to go over the areas on your head once!"
4,Excellent Product,I bought the Empressor several years ago and I use it regularly. It's easy to use and makes wonderful designs when paired with a brass template.
1,This pan warped with first use!,I'm unhappy with this airbake jelly roll pan. It warped during first use at 450F for 40 minutes. I'm going to write the manufacturer about it to get my money back!
2,Not as good as I remembered,I read this book years ago in German and I remember liking it back then. I started re-reading it and it is a lot more boring than I thought. It's mostly common sense advice. I am having a hard time reading it.
5,Excellent reference,"This book presents a wealth of technical information, ranging from radiometry to color science to image I/O. Consequently, it may not be of interest to people solely looking to do ""artistic"" tone-mapping, but it is invaluable to anyone implementing HDRI algorithms and software. In some places it reads like a cookbook with recipes for generating HDR images from multiple LDR sources and rendering HDR images for display.The authors include some of the brightest names in the field and write with clarity an concision. They don't shy away from equations and algorithms, but they seem to hit the right level of detail. For the most part the book reads very well."
3,Very cute but very loud,"I put this clock on our daughter's Christmas wish list after reading the reviews, and we were really excited to get it! It is just adorable and looks great in her room. Unfortunately, her room is not big, so the loud ticking disrupted her sleep, even though it was as far from her bed as it could be. Actually, it disrupted our sleep a bit down the hall, too. We live in a train town, so noise is generally not a problem for us. We have taken it down, and we are going to try to find a way to muffle the ticking."
1,Author Sadly Seeking Gravitas,"Naisbitt has happened upon an important topic which could have been explored by a stronger intellect to make an important contribution to academics, policy makers, and managers understanding the emerging world structure. Unfortunately, Naisbitt lacks the intellectual firepower and personal gravitas to pull it off. As a previous reviewers suggests, he substitutes trite anecdotes in place of even the simplist forms of empiricism. His thinking is simplistic and demonstrates a profound lack of understanding of the true complexity of globalization, the working of international trade, and the development of intellectual property. This work is 'People' magazine journalism trying unsuccessfully to masquerade as public intellectualism. Obviously, I am advising against reading this book if your interest in the future of globalization is at all serious."
2,Disappointed,"The first time, I read this book, I expected analytical contents and insights. But it give so much narration; no analysis and supportive evidence or data."
2,Not Ready for Prime-Time,"These guys have a long way to go. The documentation is poor, the product has many inconsistencies and is fraught with typos embedded in the interface. Stay away until they get their act together.On the plus side, they did call me back fairly promptly from tech support, but alas, not with the answers I needed to hear."
5,An Amazing Debut,"Anthony Doerr's collection of short stories, The Shell Collector, touches the heart in complicated, moving ways. Thes stories span the world and are told from a multiplicity of viewpoints ranging in age, sex and ethnicity while always feeling true and honest in their varied characterizations. ""The Hunter's Wife"" is the best example of the way most of these stories connect people with nature and through nature with each other in a circle that while often causing pain is also a means of healing. The charm of these stories is how they are seemingly simple but are actually rich and emotionally complex. ""For a Long Time This Was Griselda's Story"" does not intertwine the characters with nature as do the others but it is my favourite. It reverberates with a quietly building strength. A fantastic collection of stories."
4,Nice to see that good writers are still being born...,"This is a very solid and enjoyable first story collection, particularly the title story and a little romp called ""July Fourth."" You can see the gears turning a little bit, and there's a tendency to lay on the technical details too heavily, but Doerr's got great authority in his story-telling voice. He's like a nice mix of Richard Powers and Tom Paine, maybe without the fully realized vision of either, but without their weakness for didacticism as well. A writer to enjoy now and watch in the future.By the way, with all respect to the previous reviewer, these are stories, not essays."
1,not happy at all,"the product information did not say this video is probably from the 70's, it is so outdated. I was very dissapointed. boring, boring! extremely boring."
2,On Getting the Last Word In,"Nagel is out to defend reason against all forms of subjectivism, pragmatism, postmodernism, relativism, etc. The basic idea is that attacks against reason are self-defeating, but this is coupled with a generous dose of diatribe against ""what passes for argument in the lower reaches of the humanities."" Kant is also repeatedly attacked, although Nagel does not bother looking at how contemporary Kant scholars address the issues he raises. In general, this is a book written with much indignation but little attention to the writings of those about whom Nagel is so indignant. The best part of the book is the section on religion, where he admits that his atheism is not as firmly grounded in reason as he would like it to be."
3,Typical academic self-satisfaction.,"It would seem both from the title and the short reviews posted above that Nagel's latest is a daring re-affirmation of rationality and ""standards"" in a world gone awry with Rorty's. Alas, Nagel like Kripke, Dworkin, Nozick, Rawls et al. is just as undynamic and thus foolish! Yes, Christ said there are no fools, but these still qualify. Not that I think ""dialogue"" with Habermas or Derrida is useful.Better to be intransigent against them all until such time when one can afford defiance."
4,And let reason RING!,"I'd've given this book a 5, BUT Nagel does tend to be impressively repetitive. In his defense though, he explains that it's because one oughta take the subjectivist stance seriously as it applies to every field.Beautiful book. Half of it reads like poetry -- what oughta be prosaic is more like poetical in that its truth touches the soul [so to speak]. There are some eye-widening points in here (that should never have needed to BE points -- those damnable subjectivist hippies!).Nagel, by means of precisest incision, reveals more of man's philosophical pith. We have ""cogito, ergo sum"" and we haveThe Last Word."
5,Shoemaking and tools to use / attractive format,"This paperback book is a treasure I'm glad to see is still available. In this day when most shoes are made in China or elsewhere, it's glorious to know that if motivated we still could make our own shoes. It's a fascinating book as well. The print looks like handwritten italic. Profuse and helpful illustrations."
4,Essential general guide for at home mechanic,"This is an essential reference guide that cover a wide variety of outboard motors. It might not be specific enough for the more serious repairs, but is good enough to point you in the right direction. The trouble shooting section was informative and concise although I had a problem that was not listed."
3,Not enough,"This book has a pretty good trouble shooting section and wiring diagrams. BUT It has no index which makes it really hard to cut to the parts you need w/out having to wade through a bunch of stuff you don't need. The pictures are OK as far as they go but it'd be better with more short of what the engined look like on the boat (where most are serviced). There isn't much description of how a system ought to work other than the general one describing what a system should do, nothing about, say, how to get inside the power tilt to service it on the boat...rather its there but you have to read between the lines. Some Owners Maual type descriptiones would be more helpful."
3,Decent manual,This manual has most of what you need to work on your motor. Problem is it covers so many years and different horsepowers it is difficult to decipher your motors specific info. I would have preferred a manual more geared toward my specific motor. Definitely has helped me with several repairs on my 7.5hp Evinrude.
2,Need of specific information,I needed information about the fuel system on 40 hp Johnson. This manual failed to cover this fuel system. Very basic information. Sad comment of being a factory manual.
3,"Nice content, poor binding","The content itself is in great condition and very nice to look at, but the book itself is more of a children's book than a comic collection. It would've been great if they had decided to put it in a quality hardcover format."
2,the color is crud,"Stop boasting that it's in the original colors! Those colors are terrible: washed out, unfocused, uneven. Nobody in the know is going to be impressed by that boast.What you guys should have done was find the original black-and-white drawings, scanned those in, and then colored them afresh with vibrant, computer-generated colors.As it is, I think they scanned in the original newspaper printings! They look horrible! Frequently the text is so faint that one must strain to read it, and the colors look faded and amateurish.I bought all seven of these volumes -- some at great expense -- and am starting to rue my purchase. There is another printing of these coming up, and the guys behind that are apparently going to do things differently. The series starts here:Flash Gordon: On the Planet Mongo: The Complete Flash Gordon Library (Vol. 1) (Alex Raymond Sunday Strips)"
5,Very Nice,"This is a very well done movie, however it is best to watch the Christy series and ""Return to Cutter Gap"" prior to watching this because it will be easier to understand the characters. The Christy shows teach us a lot about human perseverence in times of trials and how to love and understand others who are different from us."
4,Very Good,The author has my attention. He is very knowledgeable about the subject and the characters are very vivid. Highly recommended.
1,postmodern gibberish,"Having been an editor and writer for 40 years, I wouls have to rate this book as one of the worst I have ever read, except maybe for Deep Black, which the author collaborated with Stephen Coonts. DeFelice is either a product of the dumbing down of American education, or is merely catering to the techno-nerds who couldn't tell an oratorio from an opera. The wrting is so devoid of cogent plot lines, developed characters, and continuity, that it might as well have been written for people who are more comfortable with pictures than words. This book is truly the result of someone imbued with the postmodern notion of deconstruction, i.e. that words have no meaning. It is nothing more than a listing of high-tech gadgetry (real or imagined) that would display itself in mindless video games. It is definitely a waste of money and time."
2,Alcohol Free IT IS NOT,This claims to be alcohol free but the first inactive ingredient on the label is BENZYL ALCOHOL. I emailed the company about this but they NEVER replied. This is a dumb company.Other wise my child likes the flavor.
4,True Patriotism,"Shaheed is a very realistic depiction of our India in the pre-Independence era, as our heroes fought valiantly and stuck strong to their cause of freedom. The Deols, being real Punjabis, fit their characters of Bhagat Singh (Bobby Deol) and Chandrashekhar Azad (Sunny Deol) perfectly. This movie is dramatic, and yet, so invigorating. A movie like this really boils your blood so hard that you just want to go out there and take action with big guns and go after those zamindaars. Stand up for the country's honor and dignity. Action and performances are excellent. You will like this movie a lot!! Cheers!"
1,Not the true picture for all- as it seems to present itself,"I am a birthmother, of 19 years. Ms. Barton's book seems to proclaim that all birthmothers feel the way she does, or will one day feel this way. MOST birthmothers (while still feeling a sense of loss) have moved on with their lives. Ms. Barton must do just that. I found the entire thing very insulting, and a sorry retrospect of MOST birthmother experiences, particularly birthmothers from the late 1970s and beyond. I hope my bchild (or his parents) never read this book. I would not want them to believe that I feel this way."
1,The bitter slant this book portrays is sickening,It wasn't like this for every woman that relinquished. This book paints all birthmothers with a very broad brush. We are not all stuck in our relinquishment. If my daughter were to read this would she believe that I was as bitter as these women are? I certainly hope not.
5,Buy This Book,"I bought three books on canning and this book was the best. It is simple to understand, has pictures of the way things should look, such as the canning jars in a not water bath. I was canning tomatos and this book was so easy to follow. It listed the different methods for canning, as stating the best method.I bought a pressure cooker and could not understand the manufactures directions, this book explained in simple terms, everything I needed to know, to use the pressure cooker. It has pictures on how to can tomatos from start to finish, which I really appreciated. To me a picture is worth a thousand words.I think if you are a first time canner or even experienced, that this easy to use book is for you. I know I will be using it for years to come. Thank you to the authors."
3,I'm a 1st time canner & this book was helpful.,"I found this book in the library and used it for my first garden bounty -- my first canned peaches, my first jam, and my first frozen green beans. Keeping the Harvest is informative, fairly comprehensive and simple to follow. I'm buying it now so I'll be ready for next summer!"
5,GREAT,I have recently gotten into preserving and canning. This book has been great it has directions for every possible way to preserve food and it very easy to follow and understand. I would reccommed this to any beginner trying to preserve food.
3,Great for learning to write about your life.,"Do you think your life's boring? Well, think again. This book shows you how some of the everyday experiences in your life can be turned into articles that will be of interest to hundreds of people. Every chapter ends with an exercise to get you started. Give it a try. The material you produce may surprise you."
3,Greatest Hits & Misses,"Considering the fact that John Travolta had 3 top 40 hits in the late 70's including, Let Her In (top 10 hit), Whenever I'm Away From You and All Strung Out On You as a soloist, it would be fare to assume that out of almost 30 types of collections, Best Of and Greatest Hits, that there would be at least one solid collection!! Grease was very popular in the late 70's as well and produced his 2 biggest hits as a duet with Olivia Newton-John. You're The One That I Want and Summer Nights are not on any of his collections. I'm glad that some at least attempted by putting Sandy an Greased Lightning on a few of them. Another jem missing is probably his best, Take A Chance (duet with Olivia Newton-John) from Two Of A Kind.This collection has some nice pic's and CD info in it as well as some of his hits and misses from his 2 solo LP's.They could have at least added the Grease Megamix as a bonus!"
1,Even more worse from John Travolta as a rock'n roll singer!,Trust me this isn't the John Travolta film and TV actor I used to remember don't listen this kind of music it sounds terrible. Just like other CD albums he did from the late seventies!
4,Close toPerfect,"I first saw this tool showcased in Outside magazine. After researching it quite a bit, I thought it seemed like a great rescue tool. I have not been disappointed. It's an extremely durable tool. I especially like the blade and the screw drivers are as sturdy as I've ever seen on a multipurpose tool. The only thing I disliked was the sheath. I went to a local saddle shop and had a leather sheath handmade. ALthough a little heavy, I highly recommend it for backpacking and other outdoor use."
5,The best from Victorinox,"I am knife collector and I can tell this one is the best from Victorinox (Swiss Army) and one of my best knives among more than 200 knives. Price is very reasonable, and the most important thing is this one still is Swiss Made not Chinese"
5,brilliant knife,"bought it as it was half the price as i was getting it here.Lies in my car and does get used many a times and no rust, no losening of blades. Quality blade. Mind you the main blade is literally a razor, cut my self by just barely touching it."
4,Emergency use.,"I purchased two of these Rescue tools. One for each vechicle. I rated 4 stars because I've never actually used them.The carrying cases are very high visiblity with red/yellow. I have attached the carrying case with tool to the female portion of the driver's side seatbelt in order to be readily accessible during an emergency. The pouch doesn't obstruct anything while I'm sitting in the seat, but I am concerned that they may be prone to theft should someone look in the vehicle. (Remove from sight, should you be parking long term in an unfamilar area)I hope that I have never have to use these for anything horrible, but there is a great piece of mind knowing that they are litteraly within arms reach should the occasion ever arise.The tools seem to be very well crafted and after a lot of research I decided on this product."
5,This Victorinox Swiss knife is an excellent tool.,"When I bought this knife I was a little bitskeptical as to its quality but when I gotit, everything changed. This knife is awesome, very sharp and durable. It comeshandy when you need it. It is a cool tool to have."
5,excellent,excellent product needed to complete a series of purchases required. Thank you for your attention to my person. Greetings and all the best in their activities
1,Another book in the TRASH,"I'm so tired of these books that claim to be the ""Best"".Sorry but this was a horrible book for Windows XP.Almost everything I looked up was not found in this book, (simple things that I found easily in my last XP book, ""Headaches in Windows XP"" that was a great book, but I lost it) I thought of re-selling this one but couldn't bare the thought of someone else having the same experience w/ it, so I threw it in the trash...literally!"
1,Seriously?,"The previous review sounds like it was written by a band member or a sleazy, self-promoting, sloppy-ass musician living in a dream world. The mandolin playing sounds pieced together and disjointed and the vocals are lackluster. Yawn."
5,No words....,"... just the best album i've heard of portuguese music... just magic.And I'm portuguese, i know what i'm saying"
5,very nice,"i have the large tuscan villa platters, and I wanted to add some smaller dishes. these are very nice. they arrive well packed, and they are extremely pretty. What more could you want? They are on the small side- you can't put a lot of food on them, so pay attention to the dimensions. I knew these were on the small side and that's what I wanted."
1,Via chipset not recommended by usbman.com,I fought with this card for three days on Windows 98 SE and was never able to get it up and going. USBMAN.COM does not recommend the VIA chipset.
4,"Great Books! But, not for beginners...!","Unless you are completely beginner in Linux world, this book is the best book for configuring and administering Linux RedHat 7.1 This book makes upgrade from previous version of RedHat Linux simple and easy. It provides straight to the point explanation and procedures of real-life how-tos."
2,If you have linux up and running - DON'T BUY THIS BOOK,"Many pages but for the most part, this book seems devoted to getting you up and running. It then spends quite some time going over the various programs that come with Red Hat. However, lets say you want to install a program that is not an RPM file, and make it available to all users. A scant 5.3 pages of this 1000 page tome are available to assist you with very few examples and not enough information. With or without this book, you will end up going through help files online to figure it out. Unless you want a ... doorstop, and remember, phonebooks are free, skip this one."
1,Linux dude,"Many errors in book. Reviews applications and does not give good examples for setting up a server. Most of the information presented is self explained if you just use the app. yourself.Most of the errors were related to file locations for 6.2. Before you cut and paste, you need to check what you paste. Author needs to spend more time with 7.1 if he is going to write a book about 7.1."
2,"Aside from the install, there is little help for new users..","I bought this book to see if I could use it to help me set up some of the newer services in the version is says it was writtem for. Red Hat 7.1 Don't buy it if this is your need. In fact, only buy this book for a detailed review of the install. Other then this, there is no help what-so-ever. Any of the information discussed in the book will be known already by a seasoned Unix of Linux Admin, and any help for a Linux newbie is WAY TO TECHNICAL FOR ANY OF THEM TO UNDERSTAND!!! A great example is Firewall help. Red Het 7.1 transitions to IPTables from IPchains, yet you can only find information about ipchains in the index. When was this book written? Around Red Hat 6? There is a new GUI to assist with IPTables. It isn't mentioned, pictured, nor is it reviewed in any way. Many other new 7.1 tools were also just ignored, explained in their previos OS versions, or written as if you, the reader, wrote the Linux OS yourself!"
3,Feed back on Book,"The Good: This book lives up to its title, as it is very insightfull with the commands and functionality of Linux, that may be neglected to be mentioned in another book. What secrets does is not only give the user a book to use as a reference, but within that reference, one can find hints tips and 'secrets' that the user would have PERHAPS stumbled accross while learning on their own the long hard way. So summing it up, for the intermediate to advanced user this book can be much helpfull. THis book as the author mentions clearly is not a practical guide for begginers. However, i am a begginer, and i followed along quite well. There is tons of information in the book that can help the beginner to advanced user. Personally at times i just couldnt put the book down because of all the cool stuff in it. Further more, where there is more information for those who would need it, there are references to online websites for details on any information. Which is always a good thing."
4,Quite good; leans more towards beginner and intermediate...,"The book is quite thorough... but, I'm not sure if it should be considered intermediate to advanced. This is all relative, but when 25% of the book involves showing you how to INSTALL Linux, it is obviously a good choice for the beginner. (You should be fairly adept and competant as a beginner, not a raw beginner who's barely touched a computer.)I think this book could deserve 5 stars, but I'm loathe to give a rating that high, since it was still impossible to get FULL functionality out of my laptop with USB ZIP drive. That may not be the book's fault... laptops are such wickedly proprietary beasts. There are other little nitpicky things, too, but that's personal taste. I have another Linux book that's primarily SHELL commands, which compliments this quite well.It's worth $..., especially if you have no other Linux books. It touches on a lot of advanced topics and will fuel your thirst for more Red Hat knowledge."
1,"Poor Construction, Lousy Quality","I purchased these syringes to feel my sick chicken and they are really disappointing. Not only do they not inject smoothly, the plungers are plastic with no rubber, so they're not airtight and big bubbles get in you're filling it. Furthermore, the tips are so large that a lot of food gets left in when you're done feeding."
4,beautiful leather,Folio was a gift for my husband. He loves it and it is of very nice quality. Pricy though.
3,"It was tough, but I got it working. Bad playback.","Ok, the moral of this story is never buy electronics used. DVDs are okay, but when you open the package, it may not have all the pieces in perfect working order. I found that mine was missing its software, and the disc door was jammed. I had to open the outer casing (thus voiding my warranty) and unjam it as it was caught on something. Then I had to order the software to run it, which is still in the mail. From what I've seen of it so far it runs fine. I put a DVD in despite the software lack, and it immediately read it, and told me I needed software. This convinces me that despite the jam, the thing has no inherent running problems. I tried it and it had trouble reading discs without stalling out, so I wouldn't recoomend this."
4,Shimano,Chain list for Shimano HG (HyperGlide) 9 speed:______BestCN-YM81 Yumeya *****CN-7701 *****CN-HG93 *****CN-HG73 ****CN-HG53 ****Better______
3,:) and :(,"I'm an experienced bike mechanic. I install chains perfectly, and furthermore, I've used the HG series chains forever! So, I'm bummed that I finally got a bad one! It snapped on my first ride. I probably got the one bad link in a thousand. I'll keep buying HG chains, and I wouldn't discourage you from buying one. They're solid, and I'm going to buy another, from where I usually do - my local bike shops."
5,Upgrade from the stock chain,"My bike came with CN-HG53 chain which I used for about 2,000 miles. I replaced it with this CN-HG73. It made a huge difference, especially when climbing in a standing position."
2,"Ok, but not long lasting","When it comes to drivetrain parts, have found certain Shimano brands to be reliable and durable, have always been my choice in cranks derailleurs and shifters. Purchased this chain because I thought it would work for me. Installed it on my bike in early spring this year when upgrading to 9-speed. Lasted me about two months when after climbing a hill noticed a clinking feeling in my drivtrain. Stopped to take a look and found a link was popping off a pin widening the chain and rubbing on my Derailleurs as that broken link passed through. Fixed the problem with a Sram power link. Not even two weeks later after climbing the same hill another link started to pop off a pin. Only used a chain breaker on it twice, to shorten the chain and insert the guide pin. Picked up a Sram PC951 went through the same procedure of shortening the chain and connecting it with the Power Link and have no chain problems since."
3,NO SPECIAL FEATURES,"It's great to have 35 knockouts on one dvd but that's all you get. There's not a single special feature on here.How much more would it have cost to get a 90 second interview with the fighters to hear how they set up the particular knockout? Or make a compilation of veteran fighters telling you who they thinks hits the hardest, who they've hit the hardest and still didn't knockout, etc...The dvd is barely over an hour long so it's not like they ran out of space on the disc.With all this being said if you only want to buy one recent ufc dvd you're better off going with either this one or the greatest comebacks or the soon to be released best of 2008 (the latter two are available on blu ray)"
5,Western where women rule,"I first saw this movie some years ago and completely fall in love with it. The story, the actors, the directing, cinematography, et caetera.Joan Crawford's Vienna & Mercedes McCambridge's Emma are the most unbelievable woman characters in Western movies. At first we see them both wearing colours for each state of the spirit. Vienna in black. Emma in green. It's a diversion from Nicholas Ray. In the course of the film the costumes colours are changed to match the true nature of the characters.I think Emma is THE most evil woman character in cinema history. Those evil eyes when she spread fire over 'Vienna's Saloon' is speechless... And - now - she wears black and Vienna a long bright white dress.In a very fabulous 'camp' aesthetic, 'Johnny Guitar' is unique."
1,CAREFUL - only a cutter NOT the sharpener in photo,I'm very disappointed; just received my package and it only had a very small box enclosed containing a sharpener. The photo and description for this item shows a pencil sharpener which is what I thought I had purchased.
2,Not like original product.,Cutter is too sharp. It pulls the pencils in and stalls the motor. I move the pencil in and out in a quick motion to get it sharpened. My hands ache when using.
1,product not as pictured,"Be aware!!! this product is not the same and the item pictured. if you order this, all you'll get is the blades, nto the gears!! product is actually this item http://www.amazon.com/X-ACTO-R1827-High-Volume-Commercial-Sharpener/dp/B004E2MHC4/ref=pd_sbs_op_16"
1,canciones de amor,"Give me a break! A real Julio Iglesias fan does not need to buy this album, he already owns all these songs! Another thing, what's wrong, Julio? We waited all this time for your new album and this is all you can come up with? I don't know what the deal is, his album ""Divorcio"" was hardly his best album ever."
4,Gravestone - 'Creating A Monster' (Karthago),"Band's fifth and final album - have to admit, it's quite 'metal' - '80's style. Tunes that give us true fans something good to remember them by are the ripping ""Masters Of the Earth"", the power ballad (?) ""The End Of Our Love"", ""Illusions"" and ""Goodbye Forever"". Also thought ""All Our Love"" featured rather semi-memorable guitar riffs."
4,A Good Beginning Book on Astronomy,"Patrick Moore outlines basic principles of Astronomyin this edition of the 'Teach Yourself' series.Moore, an English astronomer effectively teaches the beginner how to look at the stars.While astronomy is often associated with complex mathematics,Moore almost completely avoids the mathematical aspectsof astronomy and simply teaches the reader how to look at the stars,identify constellations; buy, make and use a telescope.A great book for the beginner, Moore's bias towards accomplishments of EnglishAstronomers and a hint of animosity towards American accomplishmentsseems to indicate that his target reading audience is of British nationalityand does take a little something away from this otherwise great book."
5,Great new author!,"The lives of two young soldiers from opposite sides of the Iron Curtain intersect in a tangle of blood and intrigue in Robert Butler's new book Border Duty. When an East German border officer attempts to defect on Christmas Eve during the winter of 1988, he unknowingly sets in motion a series of tragic events. As a witness to the defection, a young American cavalry officer finds himself bound up in his enemy's fate. When East Germany implodes just months later, the German soldier vows revenge against the only person whose involvement he can identify: the decorated American officer.Robert Butler weaves an intense and multi-layered story about the conflicting loyalties of the military: duty to country and faithfulness to oneself-and the lengths one has to go to preserve both-in this heart-pumping military thriller. This was great read and should be a movie!"
4,Great Insights into an era we might have forgotten...,"We all forget what it is like to be a teen... especially when raising our own. Huggins brings insight & balance into this difficult task... more importantly, he asks poignant questions about us, and how much we may be actually growing in this process. I suppose the greatest lesson I extracted from this read, was simply... what is being worked out in me through the process of raising my teens. Be blessed in your work with your children, and may this book find you in a place of recieving truths for your self as well."
3,Too light for my tastes,I was not impressed and will not be using these strings in the future. They just sounded too tinny to me. They are extra lights though so keep that in mind. I tried them and did not like them.
4,Song title translations,I just bought this during a trip to Sverige and had my mates translate the song titles. Here's what they came up with:1. This is what they say2. We will die at the same time3. Everything that is yours4. It will only lead to something evil5. Sometime (in the future) you have to be by yourself6. The day of truth7. Stethoscope8. Your block9. And I cry myself to sleep after all these days10. Maybe you were at Holmon11. Are you still angry?
1,TurboTax botches e-file - AGAIN.,"TurboTax has really gone downhill. After using it for years, it is now riddled with attempts to get you to pay more for add-ons, charges rediculous amounts if you have questions or problems.And then...I spent two days trying to e-file, always getting a Server busy message from Intuit. This is AFTER they got my credit card number and $34. to file the fed and state tax returns. So I had to hand assemble the return and make the trip to the Post Office. Intuit lobbied the Gov to let them keep this big $$$ plum, and then screwed it up. They had this same problem last year, and it is WORSE this year. Time to call all our representatives and get E-File FREE from the IRS. It saves the IRS money, far more than it costs. Why is Intuit allowed to suck this much more from us after making big profits on the package?"
3,TURBO TAX BASIC FOR YEAR 2006,TURBO TAX BASIC FOR YEAR 2006.It was for federal only. I could't get state to download. The Federal was ok BUT I HAD TO ORDER ANOTHER ONE TO GET THE STATE.DON
3,Did the job,"Still a slightly clunky interface - feels very Microsoft/Wintel - even on a Mac, but it works.Better than the onlin ""free"" version and more secure (who do you really want storing your tax data? Them or you?) Better than the other offerings out there last I tried them.Having said that, it's also much better than the paper forms the Federal government provides, to be sure."
3,simple but OK,Software is simple enough to make standard tax prep easy and fast. My only complaint is that you can't get a printout of the schedules and forms you would have used if you had itemized but in the end took the standard deduction - so all that data entry you did is wasted when you have no record.
1,No longer works with older operating systems!,"We used to love Turbo Tax, but beware: the 2006 version no longer works with older Windows operating systems. To me, this smells like collusion between Microsoft and Turbo Tax to try to force people to pay lots of money to upgrade their Windows systems even though the older versions are working just fine. This is particularly bad for older users (like my parents) who don't want to have to buy a whole new operating system just to run Turbo Tax."
3,didnt help me learn kung fu,"I saw the title and even though i have no idea what the book is about i was hoping i could learn Tai-Chi or some other martial art from it. I thought, perhaps, it would reveal the souther-style long fist praying mantis Shaolin kung fu I am trying to master. As it turned out it just gave me a headache."
5,A Great Accomplishment !!,"This novel of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick is a vivid, rich, multi-threaded narrative by a real master of the genre. It's a panoramic view of medieval rulers, politics, religion, alliances, manipulations, lovers -- a thick tapestry giving both the grand scale and the interrelated details. Frederick's skilled efforts at integrating the disparate Sicilian and German cultures, the diplomatic feats arising from his own cosmopolitan viewpoint, and his penetrating concentration on bettering the empire and its people are astonishing. The book does justice to a complex man of enormous ambition and his shifting and wide-ranging world. It's a huge achievement, but more than that it is a fascinating, vastly entertaining read! More, Ms. Bordhin, more!"
4,The Falcon of Palermo,Outstanding fiction interpretation of one of the most interesting absolute monarchs in history. Wish there were more battle depictions.
3,A fairly good read,"The book has been well fairly researched in terms of historical accuracy and the author is someone who has by her own admission followed the life and times of King Frederick intensively.However the narrative is somewhat disrupted in places by small history lessons that tend to bring the reader out of the world of the characters and back into the classroom a little too much.There are some great storylines and one or two fairly well developed characters, all in all a fairly good read.I appreciate the difficulty in covering a persons whole life in one book while keeping the suspense going."
1,Not recommend!,"On Jan. 31, 2008 I purchased this new Panasonic KX-FLM651 from Amazon.com. This is my third generation of this machine. But its motor automatically cycles every day at 1 am, like other buyer saying here, I can't seem to get it to stop doing that. This got really annoying since this was in my bedroom. I called Panasonic Help Line 1-800-435-7329 more than three weeks ago, trying asking them to give me a hand to solve this problem. Its supervisor (in Philippine) asked me for serial number, my contact information including telephone number and e-mail. I also wrote email to Panasonic Services. But I have not got any feedbacks from Panasonic until now. I have to unplug the fax machine's power supply when not using it. Not recommend buying this fax machine!"
3,Beginner quality,"It is beginner quality. You may have already expected this because you see the price. One cent price, one cent quality - the Chinese saying."
4,Crazy Book,"This book captures the imagery of modern day youth enslaved in urban america. The jihad we are facing in the world today is also very much apparent in urban society. Sam Time is the first author to put the jihad we are facing in the america with an inner city twist. Look for Mr. Time to become one of the leading authors to portray the jihad we are facing and put it in an urban perspective. Although this book is unedited, it still has a great appeal to me."
5,Clearly the most comprehensive summary of the medium.,The Colored Pencil is clearly the most organized andcomprehensive summary of the medium's techniques and methods.It offers all that is necessary to know in approaching its use.My only dissapointment is the lack of a broader range ofexample images. The drawings shown have a tendency to leantoward the contrived and sentimental which would be fine ifthe author also included some drawings that were moreexperimental and intellectual. The spectacular work ofartist Ann McCoy (New York) comes immdiately to mind in this regard.
4,Drivers and software are a little hard with this printer but still good.,Was easy to hook up and get connected. The fancy stuff I am still working on which software to use.
2,Short teaspoons,"These are short teaspoons. They were fine, but I couldn't tell according to the description. I was looking for the long teaspoons."
3,Spend more $$$ and go digital.,"I guess you get what you pay for. I should have paid $10-20 more and got a digital scale. I find this does the job, but you have to recalibrate the needle almost constantly, so not 100% sure of the accuracy.I advise you pay a little extra and get something digitial. It makes it so much easier and quicker."
4,WEIGHT WATCHER-WV,NICE SCALES. LIGHTWEIGHT AND EASY TO CLEAN. EASY TO USE. ONE CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT THEY ARE ACCURATE. I BOUGHT THE TRIO OF SCALES. THE SMALLER SCALES AREN'T WORTH MUCH.THE SMALLER SCALES HAD A CROOKED NEEDLE THAT MAKE READING THE SCALE DIFFICULT////.
4,great for estimating ebay shipping,"Good for what I use them for, estimating shipping when I sell on ebay. Wish they went up to 15 lbs., but for the price, they have really been good so far. I do have to reset almost everytime I use them, or I'd give them a 5. Not hard to adjust."
2,Don't waste money,"If it looks and is priced cheap, well it is. had for 6 months and broke. would never stay zeroed for tare, dial started peeling of, tray to small. whole thing was just plastic. look around for something a little more expensive with metal body and frame it's worth it."
1,Disappointment,"I bought this scale to go on my kitchen counter for when I pack and freeze meat. When the order came I read the instructions on zero'ing the dial. When I turned the knob on the back to adjust the scale and the needle barely moved. So I turned it back the other way and the needle did NOT move. When trying to adjust it again I found that the knob was turning independently of the screw. At that point the knob was all the way down on the scale and NOW the knob and screw are turning as one...the scale still won't adjust and the part where you put the bowl is so tight that the scale wouldn't measure accurately ANYWAY. Compared to some of the equipment I use at my daily job this is not rocket science, this is just junk."
2,Broke after a several months,"At first I thought this was a great product for a great price, but today it broke. It was well cared for, but used several times a week. Even though it was only $10, I still expect it to last longer than four or five months. I've tried everything to fix it, but the hand is simply broken and floats between a few pounds. Time for a new one, but I guess I'll spend a bit more and hope for better results!"
2,Not a sturdy product,"I had one of these and used it in my studio for a couple of years. It seemed fine. One day I accidentally knocked it off the table and that was the end of it.I ordered another one but left it in the box for a couple of months since I didn't have need of it. When I opened it, I found that it had the same trouble as the one that went sour. I couldn't reset the dial to zero so it was essentially worthless. And it was too late to return it to Amazon.I went to my local hardware and bought another scale -- more expensive but seems less likely to break."
1,Poorly scanned,"Do not purchase this book. I have an original edition of the 1856 book from which this recreation is made. In this scanned version, every line of every song is cut off at the end, making it impossible to play the songs. If I could give zero stars, I would. The intention of the seller is good, but no one proofed the scanning and caught the error of the truncated songs."
5,Awesome,This book is really for someone who wants to make a change in their life. It gives to keys to success.
5,The real deal,"I read this book several years ago, forgot the title and have looked for it for quite some time. It is one of those eye-opening books that you should keep and read again from time to time. I am most grateful for the influence this book has had on my life. A very real and practical approach to self improvement."
4,A Terrific Source of Inspiration,"Most of the pages she illustrates are the larger 12x12"" size, but the author does give some examples of 5.5x7.25"" and 8.5x11"" pages, too. The projects are described step-by-step very clearly, and the photos of the pages are clear and bright. Overall, I found this to be a neat book with some really clever ideas. There are things I personally would not do (like use brads and buttons and stuff making the pages bulky and awkward), and I think she's wrong to use original photos and recipes, but that's my opinion. I really loved the idea of using vintage textiles as background art and clip art. It's definitely worth a look!"
2,Just so-so,"I bought this book because it was really cheap. I'm glad it was, I was hoping for more ideas. Some might like it but it fell short of my expectations."
5,Works Great!,"Exactly what I was looking for. Fast shipping! Works great!No issues whatsoever. I wish that plantronics would have used micro usb, so that I didn't need so many wires."
4,"Great Accessory, too bad the bluetooth device is poor",Very convenient accessory to have if you are on the go. Provides the ability to charge your bluetooth headset from your laptop or any computer with a USB. Too bad the Plantronics headset is so poor.
3,Handy but could use better design,"I use this device with my Plantronics Voyager 510, and find it a very handy alternative to the wall charger. However, I agree with the other reviewer that the contact is not good. If you purchase this item, you must make certain that the red light on your earpiece is blinking; otherwise it is not charging."
3,A few errors noted,"The book is pretty good, but I noticed the following errors:Page 155 gives the Big Bopper's birthdate wrong, as Oct. 29, 1932. He was actually born on Oct. 24, 1930.Page 159 says the Buddy Holly statue in Lubbock, Texas, was unveiled in 1979. It was actually unveiled in 1980; I was there and took pictures.Also on the same page, Peggy Sue's last name is given as ""Backman"". Her full name is Peggy Sue Gerron Allison Rackham.Page 181 says that the sheriff of Cerro Gordo County, Iowa, found Buddy Holly's glasses while walking through a field. The sheriff actually found several items belonging to the Three Stars in storage, not in a field.It's errors like this which show sloppy research that I didn't rate the book any higher."
4,"A great guide, from Presley to punk to Pavement","For rock-and-roll fans, this book is long overdue. Whether you're planning a road trip to Graceland or just want to know where to find a hole-in-the-wall record store on your next vacation, this book is for you. Most travel guides focus on families and seniors, but this book is definitely written with a younger, hipper sensibility. Region by region and state by state, you'll find most everything you'd want to know about a city's rock-n-roll shrines and out-of-the-way spots that most guides (including Fodor's) usually leave out."
5,A wonderful escape from reality,"This movie is a very deep and philosophical story of the Flying Dutchman. A man doomed to roam the seven seas for eternity unless he meets someone who loves him enough to die for him. There are wonderful quotations from 'Dover Beach' and 'Omar Khayyam' which say so much. If you want an escape from reality and enjoy well made movies with deep characters then this is THE movie. One of James Mason's great performances, in my opinion, and a great performance by Ava Gardner. Nothing wooden about it!!"
2,"confusing, Curdled elements. Not the one I originally saw !","Many , many years ago , in Britain, I saw a DIFFERENT version of this movie which was riveting and fascinating. (I have NEVER forgotten the lines about ""The moving finger writes and having writ moves on....""!) The end of the movie was in B+W, with them both leaning over the rail of the Flying Dutchman and mist and sea spray adding to the ""DOOMED"" aura. This version was both disappointing and almost embarassing in its flamboyant, self-indulgent, self-consciousness....PLUS the over saturated color-work. However, as it happens I can find no reference to the copy I originally saw....??"
3,Pandora and The Flying Dutchman,"This is an ""old fashioned"" feature film story with a definite beginning, middle and end. Previously rerun on TV in b/w. Now richly restored here in Technicolor. A kind of dreamy, mysterioso masque, thankfully not realistic at all. James Mason and Ava Gardner are truly fun to experience here. Definitely worth watching, recalling perhaps a gentler, more romantic time that never really happened at all, and therein lies it's magic. Definitely worth watching, as long as you don't fancy yourself a hard realist."
1,Terrible condition/service,"The dvd arrived unplayable. Tried getting in touch with vendor to no avail. I do not have time to deal with bad merchandise, nor do I want to spend good money after bad to correct it!"
1,Pandora and the Flying Dutchman,"This review is directed at the KINO VIDEO DVD production of Pandora and the Flying Dutchman.1. The color, brightness, contrast and color saturation levels are unacceptably poor and change from scene to scene. Seems to have been re-mastered by incompetents.2. The plot is utterly convoluted, seems trite and full of cliches, and does not hold one's interest. Irrelevant ""Spanish Color"" has been inserted here and there in an unsuccessful attempt to liven things up.3. The acting is less than mediocre. Ditto the script.4. This version of the movie is meant to be nothing more than a showcase for the glamorous Ave Gardner who, with all her glamor, is no great actress.I recommend you not buy this low grade DVD."
4,A little slow but a classic.,"We were inspired to buy this because our daughter did not know of the legend of the Flying Dutchman from the *Pirates of the Caribbgean* sequel. It is a little slow going but the color is vivid, the scenery is beautiful and I have always loved James Mason. Another oldie but goodie sea story is The Ghost and Mrs. Muir with Gene Tierney and Rex Harrison."
1,Remastered????????????,I loved the original story and actors. This video technically is not what I expected. I would have thought a remastered video would have been easier viewing. It is far too dark. Even after playing with all the combinations on the vcr and tv for brightness and color it was not acceptable.
2,Watch Out!,"Several of the songs on this CD are NOT the original releases. These are:Monster Mash, Haunted House, The Purple People Eater, SpookyIf you want the originals, this is not the CD for you."
5,I LOVE THIS CD,Its great for halloween or anytime! The songs are great for dance parties! I like the monster mash best. Its a classic. Have fun!
3,Wasn't quite what I expected.,"I used it over a week now and my face started to get a allergic reaction. My face stings and get red blotches everyime with use. Even started to break out a bit. I find the tint to be more on the orange side instead of a natural bronze color. Therefore, I'm gonna have to look for somethig else. It was quite a disappointment since I am a fan of neutrogena products."
4,very sheer but doesn't cover much,"This product is fine. It gives a very sheer coverage to my skin and it doesn't cover much, if at all. I also use Clinique City Block Sheer Oil-Free Daily Face Protector SPF 25 or 40 on some days. In my opinion, they seem to 'cover' more but also feel a bit heavier. So, it depends on what you want. This product is very light and the color does blend in easily. I use shade 20. And so far it doesn't cause me to breakout."
4,"Light, Nice Color, Non-Greasy","I really like this tinted moisturizer. It's half of what I've spent on other products that have left my pores feeling clogged and my skin greasy. This instead leaves you with enough color to enhance your features, but not enough to be make-up -- it's very sheer. I am African American and Native American with brown/caramel skin. The medium to tan was the right color for me. It leaves my skin with a nice, non-greasy glow.I recommend this product, especially at the price."
1,"Gloppy, made dry skin obvious and clumped together","This made my dry skin MORE apparent, even after using a regular moisturizer beforehand. It made my face shiny and seemed to just sit on the surface of my skin rather than absorb into it. The tint made my skin look flaky and clumped dead skin together. Gross. Never again."
2,Too sheer and very little coverage,I decided to try this foundation that had mixed reviews. I was not impressed. It's so sheer that it provided little coverage for me. I have a red undertone to my skin and this did not tone that down so I was still very pink looking. Would not purchase again.
5,Plan Ahead,"The examples and solutions within Fingar and Smith's book clearly illustrate that the future of business process exists within a framework that reaches beyond the box that now defines IT.For any one that wants a glimpse into the bright future of e-commerce and the marriage of IT & Business, this is a must read."
2,Someone has been working way too long on the vendor side,Wow. The fact that the author is from CSC clearly shows. Although there are many points the author makes that I'm sure everyone agrees on. I can see why so many of his peers say this is just another way for CSC to make more money by getting IT out of the way. Indeed I truly think the author(s) need to get a closer look at how diverse IT is used from industries everywhere. And especially take a look from a business manager's perspective. Not from a vendor's
1,Misleading,"I was very disappointed by this book from page number one. The author is not focusing on a discussion on Pride as a goal, but mainly using Pride as a vehicle for the disgruntled preachings on racism and religion that characterize his late works.There is, however, a different tone that accompanies the painstaking details about the historical background of the sin of Pride. That tone is boredom. When Mr. Dyson is not trying to make your head explode with statements like ""black pride is good but white pride is evil"", he will instead try to conquer you by providing you with too much information written in a monotone style that would be more suited as a sleep aid.Michael Eric Dyson has abused the Seven Deadly Sins series for his own personal agenda, by pushing his writing to readers who would otherwise refuse to buy anything with his name on."
5,THANKS TO MY BRAZILIAN FRIENDS...,"This is a great cd with lots of lively songs, all of which makes you move. I do not need to understand a single word to appreciate this album. Anyway, isn't the language of music universal? For those who are not as fortunate as me to get this cd as a present, I strongly recommend to buy..."
4,Classic Wayne WWII Marine Film,"Sands of Iwo Jima is John Wayne as Sgt. Stryker training and leading Marines in WWII. Overall, the film is excellent, and stands well beside Wayne's other WWII films. Wayne is in his element as Sgt. Stryker, and his squad is quite a cast of characters. I enjoyed it, but it is a little light on action. I would recommend that any Marine see this film, but my guess is that all of them have. If you like WWII films, this one is a must see..especially since the ending is tragic and inspirational at the same time, and captures a moment in US history worth remembering."
5,PJohnson,Never a complaint with go Hastings. this is the first company i go to whenever i want to buy a DVD. They have great prices and they ship everything very quick. I recommend this company to everyone that i know. thanks for everything!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A leaden and slow war picture that's dated and feels like it lasts forever, Sands of Iwo Jima manages to nicely incorporate some actual combat footage but does little else of value over 2 mind-numbing hours."
5,Underrated war movie,"A CLASSIC! One of the finest stories of courage and sacrifice in wartime ever filmed, it is up there on my list of favorites right beside The Triumph and the Glory and The Bridges of Toko-Ri. Brilliant, the Duke at his best!"
4,Sands of Iwo Jima,The movie Sands of Iwo Jima is fantastic but it was way overpriced. I would recommend it at a lower price.
1,Daughter of an Iwo Vet,"The product results in John Wayne playing the same role he always played, just in a different setting, and the script not being true to life. The reality of the battle is not there - the movie is mostly fantasy peppered with a few facts to give it some credibility. How do I know it was not true to life? My father was there. He was a John Wayne fan but was disgusted by the movie."
1,too much hollywood hype,"When I saw this movie as a young boy, I loved it. I saw it later in life, having served 4 years in the USMC, and I found it way off the mark. I was very disappointed."
4,Good neutral Balance Shoe,"Good neutral balance shoe. Already replaced by two other models, but this one is still better for me."
5,Este Es un buen Libro de Boliche,Este es uno de los mejores libros de Bolos que he leido. este libro me ayudo con mi promedio en un 25% yo le recomiendo este libro a todo boleador que esta comenzando a jugar....
3,Great at first,"I was really looking forward to getting this tent bed for my son as his bed is in a common area for now and I wanted this to give him a little privacy. I was actually excited when we got it. It is made of thin tent material. The mess at the top is not very big. It hooks to the mattress via four elastic pieces that fit under the corners. It fit and has not come loose from the mattress in the week that we have had it. However a couple days ago, one of the pockets that holds the tent poles ripped out at from the seam. There is not any real good way to fix it being the material that it is. Feeling like I wasted my money and wishing I had used pvc and made my own in the end."
4,Entertaining and thought-provoking,"The range of reactions by the kids is amazing - from deeply visceral to highly philosophical. While not every letter is a gem, you will definitely see yourself in them and learn something about your own feelings toward terror and the people behind it. By helping these kids express themselves, the authors have lit another candle in a dark world."
5,Wonderful conversation starter for discussions w/ your kids,"This is a very special, easy-to-read book that truly captures how teens are feeling about the events of Sept. 11th and beyond. Their words bring us hope, tears and laughs. I think the course that produced these letters must have been very therapeutic for its participants. I know that my sons (ages 13 and 10) really benefited from reading their ""peers'"" words and it has inspired them to write their own letters to terrorists. Bravo!"
4,Short Observation,I do not understand the idea of incompetence by the railroads in dealing Longstreet's movements. Longstreet made it to the Army of Tennessee in time to play a major role in the victory at Chickamagua. I believe another example of Confederate troop movements could have been used in place of one that was successful.
5,the reality of war,I served in the Korean War and at age 20-22 learned what war really is. This book dramaticlly and factually presents the reader with that horrible reality. It's not about winning and losing - it's about the unforgettable experiences of individuals on both sides. You will learn a great deal from Lori Grinker's book and you'll never forget the images she has captured.
3,STEP STOOL REVIEW,NOT AS HELPFUL AS WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FOR GETTING INTO BED. WILL USE TO GET TO HIGHER SHELVES.
1,poor results,never recieved item..... both companies (vendor & amazon) never returned phone calls..... do not recommend ordering from here.
1,Horrible Book,"Analysis: once in R, then again in R^n? No thanks. This book is verbose when a theorem is obvious, and too brief when a big proof has just been dropped. The exercises have nothing on Kolmogorov & Fomin.Long live Rudin!"
1,Terrible Book: Only buy it if your class forces you to,"I am really sorry if your instructor has forced you to buy this book. Buy Mary Hart's Guide to Analysis in order to understand the materialGuide to Analysis (Macmillan Mathematical Guides). It will get you through the first half of Wade, but sadly ends before the second half of Wade. Only use wade so that you have the assignment questions.The author skips major sections of proofs necessary to understanding the material with a snide arrogance that is downright insulting to the student. It is astounding what tenured professors and coddled publishers can get away with these days."
1,Horrific!,"This is the worst analysis book ever. Short, unclear proofs. It takes forever to fill in what the author omits. Sections include no examples, or one of them if you're lucky. Pathetic textbook, I have no idea why professors keep assigning it. It should go extinct."
4,Great sewing machine value,"Tension was perfect right out of the box. It is plastic cased, so I am treating it gingerly compared to the hefty metal machine on which I learned to sew. Very easy to thread and wind bobbins. The manual has very clear illustrations. However, it requires some flipping through as each series of steps is printed in several languages. Very enjoyable, and I look forward to using it. I hope with care it lasts a good long time."
2,not worth the money,The machine worked for a few days... it was out of warranty by the time I started to use it. The amnual says that it has no user serviceable parts. So had to pay $50 just to get it fixed. Spend more and buy a better quality machine. The authorized service center guy told me these type of cheap machines break very frequently. Stay away!
3,OK for a while,"Interesting concept, but not enough to hold my interest. Goes from very easy to very difficult very quickly. I found myself just trying to solve the puzzles sitting there in the time alloted to complete the puzzle. By the end, it was impossible, I would play the same level over 50 times before giving up. However, the game was worth picking up, something different and smart. There is some replay value. Buying used is probably worth it."
2,Mine melted too!,I too purchased this switch a while back and things were going fine until one day a few weeks ago it literally went up in smoke. Thank goodness I was there or I could have lost everything.
2,Great - until it blows up!,"I thought these units were wonderful until mine literally(!) went up in smoke. A chip by the powerjack overheated, and continued to burn until it finally melted itself off the PCB. The unit was mounted on a wood wall in my attic - a little hotter and I could have lost everything!Before the flame-out I thought it was great - small, cheap and easy to use. Now I'll think twice about trusting their products."
4,great deal,"At the price this switch seems like a great deal. The switch is nice and small and I swapped it out for my old 10 mbps hub without a problem. I did not know what to expect in terms of performance, but a 550 MB file that use to take about 10 minutes with the 10 mbps hub now transfers in about 4 minutes."
3,Hotel Info not accurate,"I booked and prepaid Ruby's in Ambergris Quay on their recommendation, and found it to be an absolute dump, full of cockroaches, grimy throughout. There were many better choices for the same price which were not in the book. But a hotel they criticised, La Casa de Don David near Tikal, we found to be spotless, reasonably priced, good food and very convenient for visiting the ruins. This definitely brings into question the integrity of their hotel ratings and the independence of their recommendations."
2,For those traveling to Placencia,"For those people planning on traveling to the southern parts of Belize, be forewarned that the Lonely Planet guidebook has not been updated since the hurricane destroyed much of Placencia a year and a half ago.We stayed in Placencia for a week using the Lonely Planet guide, and some of the restaurants and accommidations listed no longer exist. The places that do still exist have been totally rebuilt since the reviews were written.Finally, the activities listings were generally accurate but the reccommended guides no longer offered the services described in the book. We went out of our way to find the reccommended guide only to discover he no longer gave tours!"
1,DON'T DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this hosta by the picture on the listing. I was shocked when I received it that it was a one year tissue culture, had 1"" roots like hair, and will NOT survive the winter. I would STRONGLY advise someone not to order from these people. When I mailed Hirt's Gardens regarding my dissatifaction, they simply ignored the problem and suggested returning the hosta. They do not want to address the problem. Now I am stuck with a $10 plant that will not make it through the winter. What they could have done is told customers it would not be ready till next year, then shipped in the spring when the tissue culture had roots and could live outside. I have to assume that all their plants are this way, since that is the CHEAP way to grow hostas. This whole plant is no larger than a CHICKEN EGG, if that gives you a hint at how bad it is. Caveat emptor!!!!"
2,Not What I Thought It Would Be,"Did not handle small sliced items very well, kept falling out. Design had major flaw with locking mech. You could only use the lock for the lid if the lid is sung to the handle which squishes larger food items thicker than a piece of paper. The lid locking mech is the real downer, seems like its just used for storage of the basket but you can't hold the lid in place when you flip the basket because it will get hot with the rest of the basket. Works great if you are cooking paper. Could not close grill lid on handle, grill lid will push up the whole basket. Also, when you flip the basket to top down, that side sits farther from the heat (not that big of a deal). Returned this basket to Amazon."
3,Quality is high but uses are limited,"This grill basket shows well and feels great. The non-stick grates are a breeze to clean and it hangs up easily for storage. It has a nice sturdy feel.The pictures are hard to tell, but the space between each grate is too large for many grillable items. I purchased this mainly to grill vegetables (asparagus, mushrooms, onions, squash), but I found out rather quickly that it was quite easy for them to fall through. This is rather disappointing since the rest of the attributes are great."
3,Works but clumsy to flip,"I bought this hoping it would make grilling veggies or small items easier. It works, but it's clumsy to flip over on the grill. Wear really good protective gloves so you don't get burned."
3,Sturdy but not as non-stick as I hoped,"This basket is a lot sturdier that what I expected for the $15. Thts the plus.The only issue was that it wasn't so easy to clean. I scrubbed and scrubbed and still couldnt get all the bits off. I got it because it said non-stick, but my lamb chops and burgers still stuck to the thing. Oh well."
5,Stone Cold's music taste rocks!,"The back of this title says, ""All Songs Selected by Stone Cold Steve Austin #1."" I was searching the bins, and looking at it for curiosity value, and the unbroken lenticular jewel case... When I looked at the track listing, I was sold. This is chock full of rockin tracks, better than many hard rock and metal comps. Good stuff Steve Austin! Too bad you never followed up with Vol 2!"
3,WWE promotion gone wrong,Great music on this disc but honestly this was one of the great bombs of WWE marketing machines trying to squeeze every dime out of a great character and his energy as a performer. About the only reason I bought this disc was out of the curiousity of it but I did find a few random hits from the past that were good keepers. Mainly this CD was made for hard core fans who buy everything available for a WWE character no matter how thin the tie-in.
2,"I thought this would be good, but it wasn't.","My god, I can't believe how much this cd ended up sucking. I expected there to be actual good metal songs on here (i.e. Metallica, Black Sabbath) but instead there's such total and complete crap as ""Rock You Like A Hurricane""? WHY? Does Austin actually like this crap? If so I think he deserves a good swift kick in the nuts."
4,This CD really gets me pumped.,"Hear me warriors. I thought this record was quite a good selection. The scorpions are by far the best band on the whole album, yet the others show a strong showing none-the-less. I do, however, have one complaint. The last track on the CD entitled ""stone cold"" just sucked. It doesn't go along with anything else on the album and thus is totally out of place. And That's the bottom line, cuz stone cold said so."
4,"Waterloo, keine mich angeseh'n im Sturm wie du","This single contains the German version of Waterloo as track 1, the English version as track 2 and an 8 min medley mix as track 3. While the mix is a bit choppy, it's still worth having. The mix is of these songs: super trouper, dancing queen, take a chance on me, I do..., gimme gimme gimme, money, money, money, sos, mamma mia, waterloo, knowing me knowing you, one of us, chiquitita and fernando."
2,Nice while it lasts,"These were nice while they lasted, they brake nicely and strong. The problem is they have been completely worn down in less than 100 miles of riding. I use them a decent amount as I stop at most stop signs and lights but to think they can wear down so quickly is a let down. I would not buy them again as it is going to cost me an arm and a leg to be replacing these monthly."
4,good brakes but the mounting stem is way to long,"These work well, but they have made the mounting stem way to long for most brakes. There are a ziilon spacers and washers included which you need to be able to mount these. Because of this they look funny. Should offer a design with 1/2 the stem length."
3,noisy,"These work well, but are very noisy. I'm not sure if it's my wheels fault, but otherwise a great product."
3,Neophyte,"Is the price for 2 or 1???? Are these a standard fitting pad? I assume I need to order 2 pairs? More INFORMATION, please!"
5,Equal to Kool Stops,"These stop the bike with the same exact feel as a set of regular Kool Stop pads. Quiet, not grabby, and good linear feel. Put these on my kids bike, so I don't know how they are in the wet. These pads are slightly curved to better fit a bike wheel. They lined up perfect with a 26"" wheel. On my boy's 20"" wheel, the curve allowed me to get more brake surface against the wheel than a straight pad would. I gave 5 stars because the standard Kool Stops get five stars. I don't know how these would compare to the pad inserts, but I do know they are better than the stock Shimano pads."
4,Mongoose XR-75 Brake Pads,"I searched the web for Mongoose XR-75 bike parts , but was unable to find a site specifically designed for Mongoose bikes. Most of the sites had generic parts, and did not give adequate details. Finally, I decided to ordered the Aztec bicycle brakes from Amazon. I ordered two pairs, they arrived within five days. They were easy to install, they fit perfectly and work even better than the originals. Note, most bicycle repairs requires metric tools, so be prepared whenever you attempt to do any work on your bike with a good set of metric hex, and open end wrenches."
5,Coloring Book With Stickers,"This book came in great shape, and it was a used book. Thank you so much for getting it to me. Hope we can do business again.If you know where I can get a coloring book or any book with Mickey & Minnie Mouse dressed in christmas clothes it would be great if you let me know........Thanks againS.Savoy"
4,The Fire Thief,"The Fire Thief is about a half-god named Prometheus, who stole fire from the gods. His punishment was for him to get chained to a huge bolder and every morning a bird rips him up. One day Prometheus escapes and hides in Victorian Eden City, and befriends an orphan named Jim.He is hiding from the most powerful God, Zeus. Zeus takes over a man's body named Mucklethrift. Prometheus and his ""uncle"" go to Mucklethrift's house and plan to do a magic show. While the magic show is being upheld, Prometheus goes and scavenges through Mucklethrift's house to find any valuables. Prometheus has many adventures such as this one and the huge bolder.I recommend this for readers from 8 to 13 years of age. There are also 2 other books in the series. Check them out!-Richard Goble"
4,A tale of three warriors,"It was a true tale of the many who could have a chance to live to tell, but also many perished withouttheir horor being published."
5,John Waye,"This movie was made long before it was popular to make fun of men - strong male character, but with a gentle spirit underneath.One of my favorites."
1,"Dang, German version","My screwup, but the version I got was in German. When I got it i thought i could still play it since it had both German and English language selections, but I think the European dvd's are configured differently and I could not play it.My bad, but it was not clear when I ordered it."
5,Almost the Best Edition,"This is one of the greatest movies ever made. This is the newest DVD edition of this movie. The picture and sound reproduction in this DVD are 'killer'. As good as the Blu-Ray edition, in my opinion. What prevent this DVD from getting my highest recommendation is that it does not have the Maureen O'Hara commentary that is on the Artisan Collectors Edition DVD of the Quiet Man. Yes, this commentary is that important. I am just glad that I have BOTH DVD edtions of this film-one to watch this movie and one to enjoj this commentary."
2,Quality,"The quality is very poor for a collector's addition. I was quite disappointed, when I attempted to watch it. I LOVE the movie itself....but this DVD is not worth the $33.99."
1,No sound to the video.,"The ""PLAY"" part of the disc does not have sound to accompany the video. The interview with Leonard Mauldin has sound but not the movie."
2,classic movie,"I had to return this DVD because it kept freezing up on me, no fault of amazon they were exceptional in making sure I could return it. Thanks so much. I will be ordering a new ""Quiet Man"" in the near future"
3,Color really blown out,"Great movie, poor transfer. They were obviously trying to brighten the colors, but they created a distracting banding effect. Also, for the 60th Anniversary I wish they had put the extra footage from the TV version."
1,"No Subtitles, no money","I love this movie, plain & simple. I have been waiting for the blu-ray forever, but because they were too cheap to add subtitles I will not buy it no matter how good the picture quality is. Companies like Olive Films who discriminate against the hard of hearing & the deaf should be put out of business. This might sound harsh, but more & more it is becoming hard to find good movies & TV series that have caption or subtitles added. It's very frustrating to us."
1,"Good movie, no subtitles",I really would like to buy this movie but like all OLIVE released movies - they don't have any subtitles for hard/deaf hearing or foreign speaking people. A BIG shame in the 21th Century
1,THE Quiet Man,"This DVD was sold from Germany as a ""Region 2"" DVD I had no idea that it would not work in the US. How am I supposed to know that. I threw the damm thing away."
1,blue ray in stereo????,"The Quiet Man (60th Anniversary Special Edition) [Blu-ray]poor sound ( Stereo!!), poor aspect ratio, no special effect, NO CLOSED CAPTION.Cheap Crappy Blue Ray. DO NOT BUYBuy it if you want to feel Ripped Off."
1,Disappointed,This is a favorite movie. I have an older DVD anniversary edition but I purchased this version because in the product description they stated that this was a 4K scan of an original film. Beware...I would put the quality of the video at DVD quality...no better. I was expecting a clearer picture but I was truly disappointed. The quality is at best DVD quality. So...don't be misled if you are looking for an exceptional Blu-Ray picture this is not the choice to make.Sorry folks but this doesn't live up to the product description...not even close.
3,I was expecting more...,"The picture looks good, but it's not great. There are very few extras, and the movie doesn't include subtitles, either. I was expecting a better effort for the 60th Anniversary Edition, but I'll still give it 3 stars because it's such a good movie."
5,The Quiet an DVD,This movie is a classic. The actors in the movie are all top rated actors. The story line is very good. This is a movie that you can sit down with children and watch. I would highly recommend it for their own collection. Movies of this quality are very few and far between.
5,A St Paddy's Day go to,"I first saw this when I was a kid. Loved it then and now. The movie is great, but that fight sequence was grand. Ordered last year just before St Patrick's Day and it arrived in time to watch with corned beef, Guinness and Irish whiskey."
5,Very handy scales!,"I love these scales! They're easy to use, and have the benefit of having both imperial and metric measurements. Also, the jug is microwave and dishwasher safe, virtually indestructible, and can be used for a multitude of other tasks, such as making porridge or sauces in the microwave, mixing ingredients, etc. I also use mine to collect juice from my juicer.The scales also take up very little storage space as when not in use, the jug will sit upside down on the scales, to serve as a cover."
3,good look at past battle tanks,A very good look at past battle tanks and different features of them. Only major flaw: front and back cover are color and everything inside is black & white
5,Not your usual mystery,"This book is a mystery with each chapter as a different form of poetry. The mystery is seemingly a spoof of the standard british village mystery where many characters vanish or are murdered for different nefarious reasons by several different characters. The detective is a mysterious man in his own right that no one sees clearly or really knows. Overall entertaining, but not what would be expected as a standard mystery novel."
4,Bridging Generations,"Les Paul was far ahead of his time with guitar technology, plus he could play.For older generations, How High The Moon is nostalgia. For younger generations, it's novelty power pop with some rad guitar.There are many tracks novelty fans will love. The first time I heard the track, ""Lover"", I thought my CD player was set on 45! Many tracks feature high-speed tape playback tricks made most famous by the Chipmunks. Paul's use of studio tricks is enjoyable without becoming annoying (like the Chipmunks).The single CD has good, short liner notes. For fans of Novelty, Traditional Pre-rock Pop, Torch Singers."
3,I am not jumping for joy,"Seems like you need a qualified master to show you how to do almost everything mentioned in this book. As for the core exercises, they are simple and nothing better than what would be found in other chi gung books. I am not a practicing martial artist or anything like that. If you don't have or plan on having a master to supervise your performance and progress, then you'll be interested in other chi gung books that don't constantly taunt you with this."
1,Waste of time,I know people who have used this book as a guide for many years and they have no kung fu skill. does Mr Kumar have even one good student?
5,Chi Gung Demystified!,"An excellent book explaining chi gung and how it works - great for both beginners and veterans of the art. I have read many other books on chi gung and always recommend this one because of it's clarity and authenticity. It's hard to find a book on chi gung that really explains what it is about, instead of just presenting moves that are hard to do without a teacher. A rare gem."
5,Thank you Bruce,"I finally have my copy and can't put it down. I have already begun using the exercises, which are bringing relief to my very painful muscles. I have a lower back injury,expensive,fun thieving, injury and I know that I will recover learning from Bruce. I may not have been so focused on taking care of my body, or may not have discovered Bruce's teachings, had I not tripped over that low lying branch in the bush! The injury has been a powerful catalyst for change in my life, helping me to deeply appreciate good health and many beautiful everyday occurances in life. I am inspired to learn from him and will buy more of his books and dvds, cds... I recommend his work. There are thousands of quigongs out there and every teacher has there own way. This way is a good way to walk. Kind regards, Helen Anderson, Blue Mountains, Australia."
4,good stuff,"I was looking for something that spoke in plain language and answered my questions for me. This was it. A lot of other books were just too complicated or advanced. This helped me to correct my posture, understand what was going on and feel like I was on more solid ground with my practice."
3,"A great book, but you really need a teacher..","There are two main things about this book:A) It's filled with loads of practical information, and great advice both for martial artists and those who practice Qigong. I found the several chapters on standing meditation (Zhan zhuang) especially enlightening.B) Much of the book is detailing his main methods of clearing Qi blockages, which are the ""swings"". The ""Swings"" would be very difficult to do properly without a qualified instructor, and thus I considered those portions of the book (50% or more) useless."
5,Actually works,"I'm used to products that don't exactly have the benefit I hoped for, so Act was a pleasant surprise. As long as I remember to use it every night, I notice a considerable decline in tooth sensitivity by the end of the week. Now I only notice sensitivity when I forget to use my Act for a while. I wish more people knew about this, it's the best help for sensitive teeth I know of."
2,Feminist Critique in the guise of a Criminal Law Casebook,"I wish our teacher used the LaFave or Dressler casebooks who compile cases relevant to the study of criminal law in general. If we had, we would have been able to cover all the crimes in due time. Instead we are stuck with this biased casebook while we waste our time discussing feminist critique of crimes (especially rape). This casebook is inundated with Feminist articles. Frankly, I don't want to waste my time studying this topic. If the feminists really want to change the law, then run for Congress and change the law! Until then do not waste our time studying what the law should be instead of what the law actually is."
1,Not Worth the Price,I sincerely hope somebody eventually does an afforardable reprint of this book and sticks blood-sucking leaches like this with their over-priced cat box liner books.
4,Blue steels have a purpose,I use blue steel on my basses and guitars for about a decade. Every once in a while I try something else. I am usually disappointed. Blue steels for acoustic guitars is a different matter. These strings do not behave the way other strings do. I would only suggest these strings for the thinner electric-acoustic guitars. For standard acoustics stick with standard strings. Many people like elixirs. Personally I hate elixirs.
2,ehh,"Well I LOVE Blue Steel Electric and Bass strings, they just fall short for acoustic strings. I concur with the guy who reviewed these before me. Go with Elixir or Martin strings for acoustics."
1,These strings suck.,"It's quite simple - these strings make my guitar sound bad. I have a Simon and Patrick acoustic guitar that I bought at Long and Mcquade in late January of 2004. I play the strings it came with, but I bought a pack of blue steels as a backup just in case. My guitar sounded flat out amazing. I loved it.Yesterday (Now in October 2004) I decide to change my strings, as they are quite old. I put in the blue steels (which I bought arbitrarily, as I'm no expert on acoustic strings and these seemed like a respectable brand), and now my guitar sounds as the name implies - metallic, especially when played with a pick. There is little definition and quite honestly, I would not even consider buying these strings again. I did my homework and bought a pack of Elixirs as a backup, although I might not wait till I have to replace these low-quality strings."
3,"Entertaining, but not that great","I really hate to say it, but this book was nowhere near what I was expecting. Some of the stories were interesting, and gave me new insight into Georgia's history, but some stories only had a tenuous link to the state, and I found myself questioning their being included in the book. The stories are not that long and therefore not developed in depth; of course this means different things to different people, but for me it just wasn't enough."
2,Not Impressed,Not easy to read as the pages are cut off. I was really looking for a map that would be easy on the eyes.
1,Super street,"I renewed my subcription and rather than start sending the new subscription after the current one ran out, they sent two magazines for a while. Also, they stopped sending the magazine for a while, said they would make up for it but they didn't."
1,Could not rescind order made in error,The only thing I was unhappy about with regard to this order is that I was not able to cancel it - I made this particular order in error.
1,Look elsewhere,"Sloppy scholarship, ridiculous commentary. There are far better editions of Heraclitus's fragments available from Marcovich. The standard scholarly edition is now (and will be for many years to come) the multi-volume edition from Serge Mouraviev.Kahn uses (and abuses) Marcovich's edition of the fragments in this volume. Marcovich handed Kahn his hat in a lengthy and detailed review in Gnomon (54. Bd., H. 5, 1982). The positive reviewers do not know what they are talking about. This is not a serious work."
5,The foundation of all Western thought......,"Devoid of all ""Slave Morality"" influences from Semitic thinking, Heraclitus is pure European thought at its finest. It's usually proclaimed, that all Western philosophies are but a footnote to Plato. I disagree. Even Plato is subjected to Heraclitus. These fragments shine through, and Charles Kahn does an excellent job of giving his opinions about each fragment without forcing them down your throat and proclaiming his opinions as 100% the ONLY way they can be understood (but, in my opinion, he makes a good case for this reasons). After reading these 123 fragments, you'll see that philosophers such as Plato through Hitler among others owe much of their thinking to this one man. An Excellent Read."
1,Potentially Dangerous,I have used this type of product in the past so I don't think it was incorrect usage of the product. On my first use of the product the top blew off of the coffee maker with a very explosive force. It sprayed grounds and hot water up to 20 feet from the stove. Luckily no one was near it when it happened. I reported this to Bialetti but have received no response. I would be wary of all of these types of products.
5,Very good option for a real Italian style coffee,For those who appreciatte a real good taste coffee this is certainly a good option. Simple and perfect.
3,"Good Coffee, Non-finctioning Lid",I just bought this yesterday to replace my old Vev Inox Oro. I like the looks and price of this pot however the thumb opener on the top lid does not work. I need to see if Bialetti has another I can screw on as a replacement. Made coffee this morning and it was delicious. A little concerned now as my husband fills water over the air release - I'll have to give him a lecture and leave the room when he is making coffee.

4,Fun little glam gem...,"This disk is made up of Sweet Savage's five-song EP, a couple of rehearsal tracks, and some live stuff.The EP is excellent. The song quality for the rest of it is just as good, but the sound quality falls a little on the demo stuff, and falls even more for the live stuff (which is typical of this sort of thing).This disc may not be for the casual, I-really-only-like-that-one-song-by-the-guy-on-""Rock of Love"" listener, but for those of us that can never get enough glammy, sleazy, late-80's Hollywood rock n' roll--well, Sweet Savage is definitely worth checking out.**note for clarification: There was also a NWOBHM band called Sweet Savage. They were good as well, but a completely different animal."
4,Two guitarists playing beautifully together.,"My first musical love was piano so I came to discover Earl Klugh via his collaborations with Bob James. This recording was a slow burn for me. Two acoustic guitarists playing together without, if I remember correctly, any back-up musicians - it took awhile for the quality to sink in. The music is beautifully played and makes for great background music for a romantic evening, or when you just want something sweet to pass the time."
1,error-filled and trivial,"no question -- this is simply the *worst* technical book i've ever purchased. *LOADED* with errors -- to the point that i find myself reading solely to find and ridicule them. any simplistic concept is covered adnauseam with continual ""cute"" jokes/quips thrown in while anything not immediatly obvious is glossed over. simply incredible they could waste over 1000 pages saying essentially nothing. my first ""bible"" book. there won't be a second"
1,Not a good book,"In a Java course I took the instructor recommended this book. I think it is not a good reference book. It just lumps everything together and is void of good examples or explanations. If you are new to Java, DO NOT use this book!!!"
1,Angry customer,I wish I'd read some of the other reviews posted here before buying the book. I even had many problems installing the CD-rom that came with the book; Arrrrrrrrghhhh..... I'm so annoyed... Please no one else buy this book. It's no good.
1,Poor excuse for a programming book,"Much of the ""coverage"" consists of listings of properties and methods. Explanation and examples of how to use the information would be much more useful! In addition, the book is plagued with typos. This book is so bad it makes me hesitate to even consider a book from the same publisher."
4,seems to focus on the internet more than anything,This is a great book!!! It explains things much more in-depth than most books I have read about Java. The problem is the authors focus on the web publishing part of Java too much. So much that they just skip over some important things that one with an intermediate level of Java needs to know.
3,A flawed analysis,"Re my previously submitted Review. If you use it, please alter the word 'eastwards; - 4 lines from the bottom to 'westwards' , and correct the word 'located' in line 10."
5,Great Reference,"This is an incredible resource for an overview of each book of the Bible. John MacArthur is, of course, great!"
5,MacArthur Bible Handbook,John MacArthur is very concise and stays true to the word of God. The bible handbook is an excellent tool to study the books of the bible and gain a solid understanding of Gods' message for our lives.
3,"Easy to install, not sure how well it works","Can't complain about the product even though it isn't working on my system. This is the second Firewire board addition I have tried and each has caused my system to freeze up solid.Since they were from two different manufacturers, I am beginning to believe that is not the fault of either board maker but perhaps is the fault of the motherboard manufacturer or the BIOS firmware. Though the motherboard I am using (Mach Speed PT88AS) is supposed to support firewire, I just don't believe that boards from two different companies are both defective. I just wish Addonics had more information on their system about how their board operates. All they say is that drivers are provided by Windows XP SP2 but don't discuss any potential problems with motherboards or BIOS firmware."
5,"Great Fun for Group-time, little ones","This is awonderful book for story time or just circle sharing.The concept is to have a large peice of blank paper preferbly on some sort of stand or on the wall. Start reading the story. As the storyprogresses your moving a marker or thick pen along the paper. While telling the story follow the directions and move the marker along. Your making a simple drawing. Untill the last Supensful moment of the story though, your audience doesn't know what your drawing. A Clue: It will be the secret to the story!"
5,great maker,i use this pot every day and it makes great coffee no matter what kind i use. been using it about a year now and don't want another kind.
5,Sizzlin' Hot Coffee!,"There are so many coffee makers out there I was becoming confused by all the offers.I am a single person. I like this one because it has two (2) real stainless steel mugs. I can choose to make one mug or two mugs...If I do not want a full mug, I can make half. It makes good tasting coffee after you have experimented a bit with your personal preferences on coffee strength...Excellent for taking along in the car or on the trolley as I do!"
2,"Convenient, but makes horrible coffee","I got this as a Christmas gift and was at first thrilled. But after a month of use, I have to finally admit that it makes horrible coffee.For starters, I like good coffee (and I do NOT consider STARBUCKS in this category). I buy Seattle's Best or Lion Coffee, use filtered water, and clean my coffeemaker thoroughly every use so it looks new. I use 2+ scoops for 14 OZ and somehow it still tastes incredibly weak. By contrast, I only use one scoop in a regular drip maker and not only does it taste robust, but I don't need to go through coffee twice as fast.Greatly disappointed."
1,This book does not make any sense at all.,"I found this book does not make sense. Shouldn't the CNA exam be 50-639? I could not found the exam he specify on this book, 50-413. Maybe someone knows about this that I don't?"
1,Filled with errors,"This book is not a good guide for passing the CNA exam. The author said above that a Novell technician edited it and corrected parts from erroneous source material. Well, it's filled with errors anyway, both factual and grammatical. There are confusing spelling and grammar mistakes, wrong file names are given, and questions at the end of each chapter frequently give answers that contradict the reading! I'd hate to see what this book looked like before editing. Do not waste your money on it"
3,Not Enough To Pass,The book is very readable and does cover a lot of basics but there are just too many specific areas that are omitted to allow passing the exam with the book alone (believe me I know).
1,"If you want to pass, do not depend on this book !!!!!!!!!","First of all, the book was written from a beta version of Netware 5. Server requirements are inaccurate. The book does not follow the exam objectives closely, which can be very costly. Some areas are not detailed enough to give you the information you need to pass: Block Suballocation, rights and IRF, installing a NetWare server and Z.E.N.works.Authors need to be more responsible when it comes to producing certification manuals, because their customer's careers are depending on it."
2,"Interesting, but not quite there.","This Study Guide provides a good reference for beginners to NetWare. However it does not provide the reader with any sort of appropriate exam preparation.If your interest is to learn more about NetWare, this book will give you a lot of relevant information, but it does not provide in any way the informtion needed to pass the exam or become a respected CNA."
3,Good reference - but use other sources for the exam.,"I thought the book contained alot of informtion in just a few pages - which I liked, but some of the information was just plain wrong (minimum requirements to setup a server for example). This is a good place to start to study for the exam, but follow it up with something else - like the Novell documentation. It worked for me."
3,Pretty Good,"Rose's introduction is kind of muddled, and so isn't as useful as you might think--however, the translation of the plays is good and the author is quite thorough in his research."
2,Replacement for Library book stolen.,"The book is nice, it's too bad it has another library stamped on the top and inside. The head Librarian is currently out for the holidays, but I have it at the main Library here and they'll let me know right after the 1st. of the year. I bought it to replace one stolen at a bus stop."
5,Good food!,"My family uses these soba noodles all the time. Boiled, stir-fried, hot, cold: they are always good.I am most impressed with the fact that they make good leftovers. They can be chilled and reheated without lossing texture or turning into a sticky glob.They can easily be used as Spaghetti noodles too, or broken up and used in soup if you are in a pinch.Relatively easy too cook, they don't desentigrate if you accidentally leave them on the stove a few extra minutes, and they don't require the addition of salt or oil to keep them from sticking."
5,Slurp-factor,"Experiments in Japanese cuisine will inevitably lead to soba (buckwheat) noodles. This brand is available locally, but at far greater expense. The flavor is nothing spectacular or intrusive. The texture and flexibility are the selling point. They have been used in Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki, yakisoba and stand-alone hot or cold in dipping sauce with excellent results. When properly cooked, the noodles have a wonderful texture and flexibility. It is Japanese-polite to slurp your noodles (suck them in). Regular pasta will not allow that technique, I've tried. These wrap around the chopsticks just right and slurp just fine. I like the ingredients, just wheat and buckwheat flour. The less expensive brand uses wheat with barley etc., that's regular all-purpose flour, ugh. Just a personal preference."
3,NOT 100% BUCKWHEAT! NOT GLUTEN-FREE,"(Purchased at grocery store) I slipped up and only read the front which says buckwheat noodles. We are a gluten-free family and soba noodles are on the list of gf-friendly foods. I served the noodles for dinner and in the middle of the night my fiancé woke up with a splitting headache that went on for hours. The ingredients are organic wheat flour (70%) and organic buckwheat flour (30%). Shame on me for not reading the teeny tiny print but also, shame on these companies who intentionally mislead consumers with false labeling. Don't call something ""buckwheat noodles"" when they are, in fact, only 30% buckwheat! Also: Japan's favorite is made in Australia? Go figure."
3,Not the best soba on the block,"If these are ""No. 1"" in Japan as the label says, maybe it's because children there like the blander taste. I think noodles need a little salt; other soba brands vary quite a bit in sodium content but zero is not enough for best flavor. I haven't tried the Annie Chun - from the picture they seem darker in color and that might indicate a bit more oomph."
1,Not what I ordered,I ordered Working Everyday as a Ballet class CD but when it came it was something completely different. I have purchased 5 other Behind Barres CD's and have been very happy with them. I did not have the luxury of having enough time to try and order this again.
2,Not worth the time.....,"If you are satisfied with short, strictly autobiographical stories about how Epstein discovered Buddhism in HIS life, if you are one of those people who like to approach a subject by storytelling: ""I was like..."", this book might be for you.To me, it lacked insight. Like one of the reviewer has written before: it is not deep but it is also not broad, it is not a nice read, it stops at the point, when it would be interesting to dig deeper. Even the attempt of Epstein to marry practices of Buddhism with western psychotherapy is not more than an attempt.It seems the author was so enthusiastic experiencing Buddhism in his life that he needed to write a book about it. That makes sense for him but not for the reader."
4,In my opinion,"Although I don't regularly read books like this one, it was well worth the change of scenery. Based in modern times, this books opens with the brutal murder of a town local, Ramona Walker. When the main character, Bear, finds out his brother is a suspect, he is set between a rock and a hard place. He is the detective in charge of the case and has to face sending his brother to the electric chair or to set him free. The novel is intriguing and while it has it's dull moments, it is continously suspenseful and alluring. For a reader who is open to new kinds of reading, this is definetely worth the time."
3,No problem with quality,No problem with the quality of the product. They were not the correct style for my calipers but this has nothing to do with product quality.
3,good,"I purchase this dvd to learn more about doing makeup on my self and friends and its pretty good, ok it has some information but not a lot i was especting more its more for beginners. you will find the same information in the web for free."
1,Only for the beginner,"This tape is for the absolute beginner who knows nothing, and I do mean nothing, about make up application. If you loved make up as a teen or have experimented as an adult, you already know everything shown in this dvd. If you are looking for a tape that shows techniques for shading, hiding flaws, creating the kind of make up looks that you see in magazines, do not buy this tape. I'm sure there will be women who will find this type of truly rudimentary explanation illuminating, but do not buy this tape if you want to learn professional techniques. I was especially disappointed by title, it implied to me that there would be specific lessons in creating different looks, what they mean is there are two looks, (one for day, one for night) for many of the different ethnic models, and not even two looks for each of the models. Really not a terrific tape."
2,Waste of my time.,"I researched this title on Amazon and then borrowed it from my local library. I'm so relieved that I didn't buy it because it was not at all informative. I was looking for guidance as far as suitable eyeshadow/foundation/concealer for different skin tones as well as instruction on how to to apply them. While the makeup artists did give a tip or two, there was very little instruction or guidance provided. No more than I would have received sitting at a department store makeup counter anyway. The good news is that they used real, attractive woman (as opposed to supermodels with perfect cheekbones and flawless skins)."
5,Book review,This will keep you right on the edge of your chair the entire time. And it covers a subject that has been on all of our minds for years.Highly recommended!
2,Just did not draw me in,I tried to enjoy this but found it did not engage me to keep me reading. I am sure it could have gotten better but I could not get past the first few chapters.
3,Just OK,"Interesting plot and characters, but marginally developed. There was little attempt to get the reader to buy in. Would have benefited from careful editing."
2,Too slow,I found the story to be slow and plodding and going in too many directions. I tried but the book lost my interest and I did not finish it.
4,Wonderfull,"This book is the only one I have seen with a comprehensive listing of marine fish. I love marine fish and I have used this book to figure out which fish i should brougth.There are so many marine fish to see and bougth, that is important to had certain reference to mix the diferent species.This book allows the reader to identify the fish and then find its scientific name.you soulh have this book. because it worths its pounds in gold."
2,Raising Fishworms With Rabbits,"Didn't care for this book at all, I was expecting much better. It looked as if it was written in the 50's. The author talked about his family and their lives. The info on were worms and rabbits was very limited common sense that most people already know. If I told you that rabbits poop and it falls into a worm bed made up of wet peat moss and worms there you had it. On a overall 1 to 10 I would rate this book a 3. I was very disappointed."
1,elitism for the vapid masses,"Cynthia Heimel is an elitist without the benefit of being clever or funny. Her essays are cliche, slightly misanthropic, and yet are completely lacking in wit. How such vapid literary drivel gets publication and accolades is beyond me."
3,Good medieval mystery,"Michael Jecks is off to a good start. Sir Baldwin is both knight and monk - the best realized of these characters - although where did he receive release from his vows that make it now possible for him to see marriage in his future? Sir Rodney (""my sword is my right"") is probably more typical 14th century knight. Simon the Bailiff has lovely 19th-century relationship with his wife, child and priest. I am looking forward to the next in the series - and seeing this author develop his skill and historical depth. Good work, but not yet in the league with Dunnett or Ellis or Margaret Fraser or Sharan Newman."
1,This was appalling,"I completely agree with all the reviewers who thought this book was terrible. The characters are like emotional dervishes, and Jecks has this thing with anger that, by the middle of the book, crops up about every third sentence. Not only the characters, but the writing itself, is very immature. How did this ever get published? If I had read this book first, I would never had read any of the others in the Knights Templar series."
1,Cliched Clumsy Claptrap,"Don't waste your time. Plodding. Filled with dull repetitive phrasing, stilted anachronistic dialog, and zero-dimensional unnaturally behaving characters. Reads like the unedited first attempt of a high school student."
3,3.5 stars - A good debut.,"If you've not read Da Vinci code and always wanted to know the history of Friday the 13th or what happened to the Knights Templar, this book will tell you. But under the historical information and setting, is a well-done look at life during that period, interesting characters and relationships, and a pretty decent mystery. I definitely enjoyed this and shall definitely keep following Simon and Sir Baldwin."
2,Not Very Good,"I was really looking forward to this book. I love historical novels. But this one was not very good. The writing was very ordinary. The descriptions were poor. I felt that I could have written this book! The author has an obvious knowledge of the times but it was not enough to save this book.The main characters were not interesting; the pace was slow and tedious. The WHY? WHY? WHY? got on my nerves after a while. The vocabulary was rehashed over and over. The same words and expressions coming back.By the end, I was reading one out of three paragraphs, trying to get to something... I got nowhere."
4,Very Good,An excellent mystery. Lots of fun with an interesting view of the daily life of the characters. A good read.
3,I'll Reserve Judgement on this Series,"If you read this book expecting Ellis Peters or even Susanna Gregory, you will be disappointed. The story does not measure up to these. But if you read the story wanting to read an entertaining mystery with some interesting characters, you will enjoy the book. I found the writing and the history in this book were somehow lacking, but as I said I will try another in the series before I pass judgement. I like Simon and I like Sir Baldwin, but they talk like modern people. The sense of time and place is not here. The book doesn't take you back like it should. So, I will forego a little authenticity for now, and will see if this improves in subsequent books. In the meantime I just enjoyed the story."
4,Psychology and religion meet raw motivation,"This well-researched book attempts to take us into the mind of a Templar knight, and uses the contrast between transcendent ideals and a grossly organic reality as the centerpoint of its theme. A betrayed Templar settles in the countryside after watching his comrades tortured and killed, then befriends a local bailiff, who discovers a murder -- after which all forms of mayhem break out. The main character is accessible, where others seem more like allegories, but despite some wandering verbiage, Jecks makes a compelling story out of these ingredients and cleverly adapts modern language and expectations to a radically different environment. Unlike most murder mysteries, in this one the characters have complex motivations that require the small asides the author takes into religion and psychology, and makes this one of the more contemplative thrillers since Benchley's ""Jaws."" I would recommend this to any brainy person that likes good yarns."
3,history of the knights Templars,"Well, I suppose this is not the best mystery bookor historical novel ever.The book suffers from being at the same period as the brother Cadfael series :Brother Cadfael, Set 1 (One Corpse Too Many / The Sanctuary Sparrow / The Leper of St. Giles / Monk's Hood).The result is that it seems a pale horse beside a black stallion?Nice information on the why of theKnights Templar ban is included even if the conclusion may be wrong?"
4,All you need to know about your V Evinrude,"I was very pleased with the purchase and found fast the information I needed. Some photos extra on details were missing, but from a local parts store was able to get a break down and fabricate necessary item save one."
1,Evinrude Outboard Shop Manual (Clymer Marine Repair),Manual was not much help. I was looking for detailed instructions on my 60HP 1989 Evinrude fuel system and the manual came up far short. Manual is also confusing as it tries to cover too many years and models of Evinrude.
2,My opinion,"I feel the book was written ok...just OK. I feel the biggest problem is that its too broad. Just when you are finally figuring out what your reading... its about the wrong engine size or year. I will have to admit that its probably as good as its going to get for a repair manual not bought from the dealer. Bottom line good for info, just not for a rebuild"
5,Was going to be there!,"I borrowed softcover from my Son, have only read to pg. xli so far and found remarkable facts we were told only after Japan surrendered. We were on our way for the invasion and were given new orders at Eniwetok to proceed to Japan for occupation and found out there from many of the Japanese citizens including returning soldiers many of the plans mentioned in David Westheimer's novel. I am still thanking President Truman for being alive today. I anticipate that I will greatly enjoy the rest of the volume!"
3,A page IS missing -- Daniel above is right,"Having read ""For My Son"" when it originally ran in the Hellraiser Summer Special, I can confirm that the first reviewer above is absolutely right: The last story page, the whole kicker, is missing. Oddly enough, you can go online and find at least two reviews that laud the story highly, even without the last page, so the force of the story and the language hold up even without it."
2,NOT THAT GOOD A COLLECTION OF TALES,"I didn't really like this one. All the stories were way different than the films, and not all that relevant to the movies. Very diferent. There were only a few of the stories that I thought were Ok, but overall I wasn't that impressed with the line up of short tales. I hope the 2nd and 3rd collection are a lot better."
1,Not what I expected/wanted,"I don't know about others, but the ""paint-by-numbers"" that I grew up with involves an actual canvas & paint. Neither of those elements are in this book. The book...which is what it is, not a kit of any sort...is simply a book about painting. It includes the diagrams that you can copy onto a canvas, but that's it. It was not what I wanted when I ordered something involving paint-by-numbers & I promply sent it back."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!,Everything is so detail they captured Hakufu's innocent and sexiness with great detail u will not regret this purchase
2,a road leading nowhere...,"I was intrigued by the premise of this book and randomly picked it out at the bookstore. When Carrie picks up and leaves to NYC reminded me of the same decision i made years ago when i was 19, i left the dominican republic to come to ny and live on my own and like her...left a boyfriend and a life behind. What i didn't like is that the book leads with no purpose or resolution. You end like you began, not quite understanding much. If you like pondering on the uncertainties of life and human emotions, this is the book for you, if not, skip it."
1,No One Would Believe this Ending,"Such a well written book, such great characters that lead you along so believably right up to the end with a ridiculous unlikely and infuriating ending. Do that many people choose to deny their talent and turn down a chance at happiness in order to avoid guilt pangs they don't need to take onto themselves?? Oh please."
2,"Weak main character, hard to get through the book","Carrie is one of the most weak and pathetic fictional individuals I have ever ""met"". I got halfway through the book and had to force myself to read the rest, hoping she'd find her backbone or some sort of respect for her once-fiance and her best friends. I was very disappointed by the book, not by the ending but by the weak-heartedness of the main character. She depressed me and I wanted to throw the book out my window when I (finally) finished it."
4,Slowly addicting,"I just finished reading this book, and I must say, I agree with the other reviewers who thought, at first, that nothing was happening. In the beginning I thought I wouldn't be able to get into this one, but I gave it my 100 page test. I found that I became more and more mezmerized by the characters and the dynamics of Carrie's life. Soon I didn't want to put it down, couldn't wait until my next free moment to read.Ann Packer succeeds in drawing you into the lives of her characters... some are familiar, some are surprising or frustrating, but she weaves them all together so beautifully that you realize how the outcome depended on each one. The story is very well written and will most likely touch you and will definitely make you think- ""What would *I* do in Carrie's position?""."
4,Scarlett's savvy,"The audio version of this novel is entrancing due to a combination of fine writing and Scarlett Johansson's scratchy sexy interpretation, perfect for the character of Carrie."
2,If you like 'Lifetime' movies...,"This book is very much like a made for TV movie. If this is your thang, you might enjoy it."
1,Boring.....,"What a boring book. For the first time in my life, while reading a book, I skipped to the end to see what in the world was going to happen in this boring book. Therefore, half of the book went unread. One has to keep in mind, the book originally came out in 1959 if I read the front pages correctly. So when you read about the clothing - dresses, etc., remember the year."
5,Well Drawn Emotions - Perfect Ending,"This book grabbed me from the first chapter. It had been sitting on my ""to read"" pile for awhile as I was afraid it was going to be a depressing read. It wasn't.The story begins with a terrible accident and tells of an accelerated maturing of a young woman as a consequence. The emotions are so well drawn that you feel their veracity.The setting, in Madison Wisconsin, made the book a personal look back.The ending was perfect, not contrived as I often feel about the endings of books. The book's ending left the reader with the right closure to the story and characters."
2,only a notch above a Danielle Steele novel,"Very disappointing after all the hype. This book just goes on and on with the dreadfully boaring lives of these people just out of college who act like they're still in the 9th grade. The dialoge did nothing to enhance any of the characters. Good thought behind the plot but no delivery. You CANNOT live in New York City [or just about anywhere else] for 3 months for free and why they heck did she wear her engagement ring the entire time even during her love affair with the ""Kilroy"" the ultimate ""Kill joy"".Quite a waste of time reading this one."
2,The Shameful Main Character,"Carrie Bell has to be the most selfish woman I have ever read. I was outraged at her behavior when her fiance is tragically injured in a diving accident. Carrie chooses to play the woe is me role as if she were the victim. The woman never redeemed herself and while I know there are people like this and this is realistic, I really don't care to read about such a person. There must be some redeeming value in a main character in the book. This trait is fine for secondary characters, but when the whole story is told through her eyes, it gets pretty old."
2,Simply lacking...,"The beginning of the book starts off a little bit on the slow side, but once Carrie meets Kilroy, the books takes on a whole new life. The most interesting parts of the book was the character of Kilroy, it brought spice to an otherwise average list of characters.I really started enjoying it until she went home to Madision. Never in my wildest dreams did I think the book would end the way it did. I felt that it made the storyline and buildup completely fall apart. Midway through the book, I thought the author was trying to make the point of, it is natural for people grow out of relationships. That is what helps one mature. It was evident she had nothing but good memories in Madision and so such a bright future awaiting her in New York. I didn't agree with the heroines final decision. It left me irate and disguisted by her."
2,disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this book. As I read it I kept waiting for it to get better. It just seemed to drag on way too long, not really going anywhere and when you get to the end all you can think is ""that's it?"". I would save your money and just watch the TV version of it on Lifetime."
1,Disappointing(Spoiler),What I got from the book/movie was that she stayed with Mike because he was one of her demons that she had get rid of before she and Kilroy can get together.I would love a sequel to Diving with Mike as he finds a new love that doesn't think of him as one of her demons.
1,A Disappointment,"Mike becomes a quadraplegic.His fiancee, Carrie, leaves town for the big city in search of herself. She sews, takes a lover and spends several months feeling gulty only to return home the same person she was when she left.The book is easily read, but incredibly boring and shallow. The characters remain undeveloped through 400+ pages. I kept reading, although I must admit I frequently read only every other page, and I'm fairly certain nothing substantial was missed.If you still want to give it a try, buy it used. Better yet, visit your local library."
1,Disappointment!!!!,I was really into this book till close to the very end...and then I feltreally angry and cheated. The writing of the book and character developmentwas going great. And then I felt shocked that the writer had chosen the maincharacter to go back to her codependent chameleon life where her past offamily and friends owned her after she wrote pages of her breaking out and transforming.Very disappointing and sad...I am sorry that I even read this book.
2,... couldn't put it down,"... but not for the reasons you think. I couldn't wait to see if Carrie would turn into an interesting character - and of course, she didn't.Being from a small town in the Midwest myself, it's easy to understand the supposed mentality of those around her. But the friends are so stereotypical and unmotivated that even I didn't believe them. Then she goes to New York to try and ""find herself"" and THOSE people are cookie-cutter, as well. Carrie so clumsily feels her way in the dark in this novel, that it left me wondering a) if the author had ever actually experienced life in either of the cities and b) what possessed her to write a story around Carrie, the most flaccid character ever, in the first place. If the point of the book was to convince the reader that Carrie was deserving only of the lack of the emotion she originally showed Mike after his accident (and her best friend who she all-but abandons and her mother, who she barely keeps in touch with): mission accomplished."
1,Am I alone out here?,"This book was chosen, unread, by a member of our book group. When the selector finished reading it she called several of the other members saying she hated this book, disliked the graphic, gratuitious, soap-opera-sex style of writing. She disliked the characters, finding no one who seemed authentic. She made the statement, ""I chose the worst book in our 4 years of meeting.""When she made her calls, it was to find out that only 3 out of ten even continued reading the book to the end and all unanimously agreed with her assessment. This group is a cross section of ages, experience and all are extremely well educated and have great tolerance for lives different from our own. However, we found the writing lacking in ""elegant prose"", and couldn't identify with anyone on any level. Cardboard characters with real concerns but only cardboard solutions to those concerns.Please tell me the ""Young readers"" mentioned in editorial reviews won't buy the media hype. This book is schlock."
4,Inspirational,"Packer's The Dive From Clausen's Pier kept me turning pages not only because her prose is strong and graceful, but because this is a story resting on Packer's conviction that life is fragile and that it's the worst times that reveal the truth of who we are as human beings. This novel is poignant and compelling, sure to satisfy readers who are drawn to stories about our own uncertainties about where our loyalties lie and how much we owe the people we love. It vividly captures how the bonds of friendship are pitted against the trials of surviving a tragic accident."
4,I Enjoyed this read...,I thought this was a great book! It looked at how people deal with their emotions when a trauma occurs to someone close to us. I love how the character 'checked out' of her life while she came to terms with her feelings of guilt and remorse. The book felt very real to me and I enjoyed how the story concluded.
2,a diet of self pity with a frosting of moderate sin,"""Kilroy was here?"" My reaction of this book waswhen does anything real happen after the guy breaks his neck?The nasty self-pity trip here makes me sick.Like hitting yourself on the head, so good when you stop reading this!If they are giving literary prizes for this sort of novel, we shouldlook to changing the fellows doing the judging."
2,Mediocre,"Nice prose style but the characters are two-dimensional and unlikable. A quick read and absorbing at times, but in the end it left no impression at all."
3,So-so,"I picked this up after reading her book of short stories, Mendocino, which was wonderful. This one just didn't have it. It read like a script for the TV show Everwood. I did finish the book, the story was compelling enough, but I didn't like any of the characters. I thought they were not very believable...they seemed to be a mix of northern Wisconsin hick and college student, and that's not the way Madison is. It's a town full of intellectuals and government workers...they don't produce children who get engaged at 18. In addition, I thought Carrie was pretentious and her actions ridiculous. The drive to New York and subsequent stay for a year or whatever just doesn't happen to people like her. The conversations she had and the relationship with the older man in NY nearly made me throw the book out. And the constant comparisons of her new life with her old one were just pretentious and silly. I'm not sorry I wasted my time, but I am sorry I paid for the book. It's a library read."
2,Was let down by how the book resolved,"I became really engaged with this book and especially caught up in the NYC part [ since I have lived here for 20 years]. I cannot speak about Madison but I did get the feeling regarding NYC that she was creating largely stereotypical characters. I also felt that she had so much promise as a designer that she should have stuck with Parson's School of Design and was too influenced by relationships than really finding her true core and who she was as an individual. I wondered if down the road, she would not be sorry she did not stay in NYC.But my biggest gripe was the ending conversation with Kilroy. He was a complex character as well as being terribly dysfunctional and I felt that his character needed a more interesting and complicated explanation than the simple one answer about his brother being the cause of his behavior.Like many books, this one was good until the last part and I did not think the resolutions were very satisfying."
3,Unsympathetic main character,"The beginning of the book was so well written, I couldn't put it down. But then, suddenly, about 1/2 way through, I realized that not only didn't I like the main character, I truly couldn't even sympathize with her. I didn't understand her relationship with Mr. moody NY and each time I read the name Kilroy I wanted to skip ahead and get on with it...I had trouble finishing this book and skipped many, many pages for a payoff that didn't come...There are better books out there."
3,Kept my interest but main character underdeveloped,"I realized that the main character was going through a complete reassessment of her life and what she wanted out of it, and she was doing it during an emotional crisis, but I could not bring myself to believe or like her character. She was unrealistically self-involved and detached from everyone in her life and it did not make sense. I was frustrated that her friends in Madison accepted her when she went back home and that her friends in New York cared whether or not she returned."
3,details and more details and...a perplexing question,liked the book. sometimes we wonder about the difficult situations in life; i wanted to know what carrie bell woud do. There was a little too much detail though describing every thought bite to eat and stitch...all and all i would recommend the book
5,honest and well written,"Carrie Bell is a small city girl living the life she is expected to live when her fiance's tragic accident results in his becoming a quadriplegic and forces Carrie to reexamine her life. The beauty of this story is not just the characters or the plot but in visualizing the world around them. I really enjoyed Ann Packer's writng and after a while I even liked the people she created. They are not heroes and they are not important people, but they somehow seem more relevant with their flaws and indecision. I highly reccommend this book."
2,Plodding and dull.,"The premise of this novel really caught my attention, but there just isn't any substance. Mike is paralyzed after a dive into a reservoir, and Carrie, his fiance, is torn between doing the ""right"" thing or ending the relationship...which we find was in trouble before the accident. It is hard to care what she does after the plodding and lack luster beginning to the book. Carrie just seems to be devoid of personality and spunk. I was glad when she decided to run to NYC, and saw a bit of hope when she found her ""calling"". Unfortunately the end was as gloomy as the beginning."
2,The Dive from Clausen's Pier,"The title entices. But the book is unsatisfying. Don't waste time with these characters. They are all selfish, pitiful, co-dependent bores. Carrie Bell's personal quest barely keeps the plot moving forward through settings which are stereo-typical images of New York and the Midwest. Readers are offered a predicatble ending with trite explanations about motives. As for the 'intimate and emotional' thrills, touted on the back cover? They are more like 'guilt trips and loosely defined moral values'. Send this book to the bottom of Clausen's reservoir."
1,why?,"why does everyone give ole' carrie a break? i couldn't find any reason that her boyfriend, her best friend, even her mom thought she could do no wrong. they were sure understanding. that's unconditional love all right. then there are these people who walk into her life and are instant ""soul mates"", Simon, Kilroy, Lane. What is the attraction? i couldn't find anything in her personality that would make her so instantly appealing. she sure didn't have much of a sense of loyalty. she ""loves"" Mike, she ""loves"" Kilroy, what a way to show your love. i finished this book thinking, ""what in the heck was the point?"" did the author have a purpose here, what is she trying to say?i, too, was looking for some connection between the nightgown and the story. was there one i missed?"
3,"Great start, but what happened....","The first few chapters of this book took me on an emotion ride. I thought of myself in this situation. I loved this book and thought to myself that this could be the most wonderful, beautiful book in the world....and then....what happened? I was deeply disapointed from the middle of the book until the end."
3,Unrealistic!!,"True that this book was a good read, a quick read is probably better but it was very unrealistic. Her main character, a 20 something, self involved, midwestern girl was not very likeable. I agree, everyone needs to find themselves but the way Packer has her heroine do it is disjointed at best. How convenient that she takes off for New York and happens to find a place to live without rent, that she happens to find Kilroy, she has no worries about walking about the city, her safety, or money. She is ALLOWED to find herself at her leisure. She comes and goes out of people's lives at will, seemingly ruining them, and is, for the most part, forgiven by them. That is not real life, not for anyone. Her emotions are banal and the dialogue is fragmented and nonsubstantive. The library did not have the books I wanted to read so I picked this one up and recommend that if you like some meat to your books, this won't do the trick. If, however, you need to be mildly amused this is the book for you."
3,this book is so unfair,Where was Ms.Packer during the feminist revolution? Rooster is to be read as a saint because he takes his ol' pal out to lunch once a week while Carrie is supposed to give up her life and career to take care of a guy that she didn't want to marry when he was healthy. I think that Ms.Packer lost her nerve. As soon as her heroine began to individuate she literally ran home to mama. It could have been a good book if the last hundred pages weren't such a lie to the first 300.
1,Please don't tell me this is where we are headed!!!,"This was one of the worst books I have read in years. Carrie and her twenty-something (and forty-something)peers are all sniveling whiners or frosted ice machines. They are flat. Then, all Ms. Packer's trivia which led me at about page 100 to ask ""who cares where the dishes are in the sink?""Carrie, Kiljoy, and Mike were so uninteresting, I couldn't even dislike them.It was like a really bad soap opera novel, I skipped ahead several pages at a time and didn't miss a thing."
4,Moments of Brilliance,I did like this book. I thought the idea was a great one and could be developed into something truly amazing. How far does obligation morally take you before you lose yourself?Ann Packer is a brilliant writer. Her prose is striking and there are moments when you read the sentence over and over just because it resonates so well.My complaint is the second half of the bok when Carrie moves to New York. I really disliked Kilroy as a character and diisliked Carrie even more when she was around him. The ending redeemed the book.Overall the book will make you think and you will enjoy Ann Packer's writing style even when the plot veers off course.
2,This one book was a complete waste of my time.,"I bought this book in August, thinking I would read it immediately, which of course didn't happen. SO I finally sit down and read it, and when I finished I had wished that I had lost it before getting to read it. It started out with so much hope of being a really good book. I was so utterly dissapointed.The book could have been sooo great, but she misses the mark about 3/4 of the way through.Please don't waste your time on this book."
2,Whimp,"I started getting into the book when she went to NY. All of the sewing!!! I was so happy when she started design school, I thought great ...she's finally going to do something.Kilroy was definitely the most interesting character in the book, I wanted to know more about him, his brother Mike, his family, his time in France.I couldn't believe the ending, what a disappointment."
2,Could have done without it,"Starts off ok, then muddles along endlessly. Its ok but I wouldn't waste time reading again."
4,The dive with a devastating ending,"Being a former midwestern and having numerous family members graduate from University of Wisconsin at Madison I was really excited about the book taking place in Wisconsin. Ann Packer does a fabulous job describing Madison and the charachters in the book. The book focuses on relationships not only with couples but with friends and family members as well.When Carrie moved to New York City I enjoyed reading about her journey but with some doubt. Having spent a couple of years in the ""City"" I found it a bit of a joke that it was so easy for her to exist without a bit of culture shock. It seems as if Carrie cannot function without a man in her life. The ending was a bit hard to believe. All in all, it is a fabulous read and I learned quit a bit about individuals in wheelchairs.Check it out - you won't be able to put the book away and forget about it."
3,a painfully slow read...,"I really wanted to like this book. The premise seemed interesting. The characters started out with promise. Unfortunately it didn't take long for the story to get drawn out and the characters became hum-drum. I think this would have been a better book if it was shorter...it seemed like much of it was just ""filler.""The ending also wasn't what it could have been. I did finish it, always looking at my nightstand where Lovely Bones was waiting. That book I am flying through."
2,"Boring, tedious..........","This book is very benign considering the subject matter. Carrie as the lead character is one dimensional.It's very hard to like the character of Kilroy and he's oh so boring! There's no ""love"" here, just sex. Carrie doesn't even know who he is half the time.I wanted to stay in Madison during most of the New York chapters, with everybody else BUT Carrie.A big disappointment!"
1,Don't bother!,"I really wanted to like this book, but the [weak] characters and plot did nothing but annoy. It has it's moments, but they are so few and far between that they paled in comparison to the rest of the tedium."
2,A waste of time!,I could never identify with the main character. She had NO redeeming qualities and never grew as a person. She was very selfish and finally I really didnt care what she did or how she felt. Dont waste your time reading this one with so many good books out there.
1,"Oh, please","Kilroy's name should have been Killjoy. Why anybody would hang with this depressed dude who needed counselling years ago is beyond me.Carrie's name should have been Loser. It's ok to need time to ""find yourself"" but once presented with a lifetime opportunity (finding her talent and her dream in Fashion Design) to walk away from it? She could have come back to Madison a couple of years later with experience in the Garmet District and schooling at Parson's under her belt, opened up her own business, and fulfilled any other obligations she felt she had in the area.Exasperating book."
2,So much unrealized potential...,"I agree with all of the reviewers who were drawn in by the premise, and disappointed with how the book carried it to conclusion. Several things didn't make sense, or seemed like NYC plot contrivances, but the thing that doomed the book for me was the utter lack of a sympathetic protagonist. For the first few chapters I was right there with Carrie as she struggled with her decision. What soon became apparent was that being wishy-washy, self-absorbed, and incapable of following through on a decision was not just her starting point as a character, but her ending point. I really didn't care what she chose, I just wished she would stop explaining bobbins and out-dated dresses(dark green velvet? really?) and hurry to the conclusion."
2,Hmmm,"Positives:I enjoyed the character development of Mike. He was such a focus of the novel that I felt he was the only one I really got to know.Negatives: (sorry if you liked it, I really didn't...)I found this to be very predictable.. in a bad way. Is there even a good way to be predictable?A lot of it was also completely unbelievable.. Hello? Free rent in NYC? Reality check please.So much of the plot developed her relationship with Kilroy, and then it ends up burning out and I was just like- what? That was such a waste of time.Not to mention the central characters relationship to her fiancee... They were supposedly together for 8 years and they just stop talking? Trying? They both just give up- and practically IN SILENCE? It seemed so unrealistic. It was such a relief the few times in the book when the central character cried. I was practically begging her to cry. Even when she did, though, it felt contrived."
2,Suffocating,"Many too many details. This book was okay to read, but it was pretty depressing and difficult to get through. It deals with a some tough themes (loving, letting go, self-exploration, family responsiblity, expectations, ethics). It's easy to slip into the main character's shoes, although her shoes are rigid, uncomfortable, and terribly, heartbreakingly painful. The writing was not bad, but it's just a difficult story to read. Not uplifting in the least. Could definitely have been streamlined, it felt quite drawn out, which is undeniably what the main character probably felt like in the situation she is put in. Not one to read again, for me."
1,What the...?? Bestseller??,"My cousin and I read this book for a book club we are in. We read it while we were on vacation together. Both of us could barely get through the book and had to keep eachother going by finding ridiculous references and descriptions of Carrie's boyfriend, Kilroy (yes, Kilroy.) The best part of the book for me was when my cousin finished it and threw it on the bed with a sigh of disgust followed by a sigh of relief. The book itself, however, annoyed us so much that even sitting on a beach at a luxury hotel in Cabos could not make us feel better about having to read it."
2,The Dive From Clausen's Pier,I'm a teacher and I enjoy reading during my summer break.I had to make myself finish it as I did not care what happenened to any of the characters.
3,"Well, it wasn't terrible...","The Dive From Clausen's Pier was initially engaging. Being 23 isn't always the great ride that everyone thinks it is-some of us are stuck in between adult life and childhood, trying to reconcile responsibilities with real life. To that end, Packer has created a crippling (pardon the pun) dilemma: stay with someone that you no longer love out of obligation or follow your heart across the country. But the problem in this book lies less in the premise than in the execution of the main character, Carrie. She's a completely indifferent and I had trouble summoning up any type of sympathy for her and I had even more trouble figuring out why anyone cared about her. There was very little character development on her part, and for the most part you realize that much of the novel just didn't ring true at all and you're left thinking ""what did I just read""?"
2,well written slow drive to the end,it's a well written novel and that's why i read to the end. the charachters are bland at best and the story is slow moving and predictable. i don't presonally recommend reading this novel.
5,Emotional Powerhouse,"This is the first book I have read by Ann Packer and it won't be my last! Her story about a 23 year old Wisconsin girl who feels stifled by her life with her routine boyfriend kept my attention from page 1. After a tragic accident leaves her fiance paralyzed she runs to New York to try to discover who she really is. The author explores her relationships with her fiance, new boyfriend, mom,and best friend with great depth and emotion. This book made me laugh and cry. It made me think deeply about how life can change in an instant and how there will always be opportunities that we can take or let pass by. I loved this book and was only disappointed when it ended because I wanted to know more and more about what lies in the future for these very interesting characters!"
1,Not worth the time,"Looking for a great summer read? This book is not it. Packer's characters are lackluster at best. There's little to like about any of them. They have little depth, are wooden and remote, like they aren't really in the story, just sort of hovering around the edges of the plot. And, just when you think there might be an interesting story line developing, it slips away. This book is not clever, compelling or intriging. I kept reading,hoping the story would deliver in the end, but it never happened.Don't let the book reviewers fool you. There is nothing satisfying about this novel. Reread anything by Annie Proulx instead."
3,Interesting dilemma,"The book does provoke thought. Even after reading the book and giving it some thought, I can't say what I would do given the same situation. I do recommend the book, but I only gave it three stars because I can't really say I enjoyed it. Even the main character is not particularly likable or interesting. I guess I expected the story to have more highs and lows and to culminate with either something wonderful or something sad or at least something with some emotion. Instead the story just fades into everyday life."
3,One sorry girl,"It is a good read but I kept waiting for something that never happened and that's why I only gave three stars. Carrie, the main character, is nice but boring. She is searching for something and yet I do not think she ever found it. I didn't like how she hasn't really accomplished anything while in NYC, and I also didn't like that she constantly apoligizes for everything."
2,Unsatisfying Angst,"This was a strange novel that meandered its way to the finish, which ended with a sigh rather than shout. Carrie was such a weak character that I found myself rolling my eyes half the book.And I thought this novel would be about empowerment, but instead she ends up sacrificing her dreams for a guy. This particular guy doesn't even seem to care about her hopes and dreams, even though he says he loves her.This book started with promise, but it sputtered at the end."
4,Interesting viewpoints,"Here's the thing: You can read as many reviews as you want but ultimatley you are the one who's gonna have to decide wether or not to read this book. I read this book, then looked at the reviews. I see both sides: People who rated this a 5 star book and people who rated this a 1 star book. Carrie is an annoying character, selfish and in ways unbearable. However, I'm pretty sure that was Ms. Packer's plan. Common, do you really think she didn't mean to make Carrie look this way??? There are good points and bad points to this book, however, overall I liked this book and was most intrigued by the character, Kilroy. If Ann Packer writes a sequel to this book I would definitly check it out."
1,Does this girl ever stop whining!!!!,"This book sounds interesting, but does not deliver. I became very frustrated with the main character. It seemed like she felt guilty just so that those around her would feel sorry for her. Actually, she feels so sorry for herself that there is little space for anyone else!!! I ended up siding with Mike's parents when they tell her that they feel she isn't ""reliable"". She pretends to be a strong woman, but is really just a spoiled brat. Don't bother reading this one!!Oh. . . WHO lives in New York for 3 months for FREE??? Come on Ms. Packer!!!!"
1,Tiresome,"This book was a featured selection on Good Morning America which caused me to receive it as a gift. Having now slogged through it, I'm forced to conclude that [the] book club has been reborn on GMA. If The Dive is an example, GMA is making the same kind of selections...namely novels dealing with angst- and guilt-ridden women in excruciating detail while ignoring any semblance of good plot development.There's a big market for books like The Dive. No doubt the same market that [some talkshows] target[s]. However, unless engaging in several hundred pages of handwringing and indecision with a protagonist is what you want, take a pass on this book."
3,"Mediocre, Yet Interesting...","I agree with those who have said that this book is entertaining at times, yet overall, quite mediocre. The ending was disappointing. Also, the character Kilroy is brooding and dark with no real ephiphany occuring...but perhaps that was the intent. At times, I found the story to be quite engaging, but with many dead ends. Carrie is a talented seamstress, but nothing ever becomes of it. Why? Also, the storyline that focuses on Carrie and her childhood friend was frustrating and annoying. I felt like I was hit over the head repeatedly with the fact that there was a rift between them. We get it already! The author does a great job of fleshing out the character of Mike, who is paralyzed during a diving accident. Overall, I am not sure I would recommend this book. Borrow it if you can."
2,"boring, shallow, and predictable","The plot is predictable, the characters are shallow and boring post-adolescents, and the underlying social premise is victorian. If you have to read this for a book group, read the first two chapters and the last one, and skip the tedious chapters in between. You won't miss a thing."
2,What does it all mean ?,"I have to say this book was a big letdown, even though it is rather well-written. I can't possibly like a book where I can get to the end without once understanding the protagonist's motives. Ok, so she moves to New York City to get away from a difficult situation with her paralyzed boyfriend-then what ? Why does she get involved with ""Kilroy"", who is completely emotionally unavailable ? Doesn't it bother her that he is so distant and unapproachable ? Why does she up and leave to go back home ? Shouldn't she at least let her lover know she is leaving him ?I gave the book two stars because of the interesting cast of supporting characters, and the description of Carrie's life in Wisconsin. Apart from that, I had a strong desire to shake the heroine by the shoulders, tell her to wake up and stop being so passive and emotionally half-asleep.I can't recommend a book that left me feeling so irritated at the end."
3,Almost,"The premise of this novel -- how a life altering accident forces a young woman to make difficult choices is compelling and the book draws you in -- at first. But although Carrie' boyfriend comes out of his coma, the book never does.The NYC sections are especially weak. The boyfriend Kilroy is a pretentious bore and the sex scenes are silly.I thought the relationship of the heroine with her childhood friend was the most convincing in the book. But otherwise it fell short."
3,Dive From Clausen's Pier Takes Its Own Dive,"Dive From Clausen's Pier starts with the attention grabbing dive of Mike Mayer leaving him a quadriplegic. Carrie, his girl friend, feels guilty because had her attitude been better that day Mike may not have dived off the pier. And then she feels guilty for wanting to leave Mike, leave town and leave all her friends and head for New York City. She finds a place to live, she meets up with Kilroy again and has a relationship with him. Kilroy is a bit of a drip but then again so is Carrie and they are both shallow as well.I put the book down and did not even care about finding out the ending. Then weeks later, I came back to it read to the end and found some aspects of Carrie's character interesting. She finally does return to Madison but it is too little too late and yet... Mike still finds her fascinating.This book might have been so much with such an intriguing start but instead it took a dive."
3,malaise,"The first six pages succinctly and impressively set up the characterization and tone. The conflict drew me in, but I never liked Carrie enough to live through the experience with her-- to share her emotional lethargy (dare I say ""paralysis""?). Kilroy was interesting, but too veiled; the Madison crew too all-American. This book kept me engrossed, yet also detached and disappointed. Such are the perils of writing and reading about depressed characters."
2,"starts out well, ends badly","This book could have been so much better. I really enjoyed the beginning of it and kept wondering how it would end. I wanted to see Carrie become a self-sufficient fashion designer in NYC. Instead, she is a victim of the Midwest and a classic martyr character. How pathetic."
4,"Once you get through the first 60/70 pages, it's a winner",I absolutely loved this book-- the descriptions were awesome as was the dialogue. This is an awesome read for young adults and up. I recommend it mostly for women although some men may enjoy it. I found the first few chapters to be dull but I think that the writing style was supposed to match the character's personality. a MUST read
5,Couldn't put this down,"Even though this book is hardly the best one I've read yet, it was a hard one to put down. I could relate to the characters and to their relationships, and constantly felt myself evaluating how I would deal with this complex life-changing situation. It perhaps will surprise you at the end as it did me and I question whether or not Carrie did the right thing. I guess it wasn't so much doing the right thing as doing what seemed right at the time, given the difficult circumstances, and isn't that what we all strive to do in life? Very thought provoking!"
2,Wake me when it's over.....zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I listened to the audio version of this book - perhaps it would have been more engrossing if I had read it but I doubt it. The ""reader"" sounded like she was bordering on laryngitis, which was annoying enough, but her reading was bland and devoid of any emotion.The story itself had promise but I found the writing to be uninspired and the diagolue weak. It was also lacking in depth and I found it hard to care about any of the characters. I literally had to force myself to finish listening to it."
1,Don't bother,"If I could give this book 0 stars I would. I can honestly say that it is the worst book I've ever read. Packer's main charater, Carrie, is unlikable, indecisive and just down right annoying. As a matter of fact, all of the charaters are annoying. Trust me, any other book you pick will be 10 times better than this one."
4,Very good Read,"I completely enjoyed this book, got wrapped up in the characters and read the final 200 pages in a night. I would have rather read a different ending but still derived much pleasure from this tale."
2,Disappointing,"This coming-of-age and self-realization story is one that, unfortunately, did neither. While the author did a successful job of setting up a situation that made it possible for the main character to grow and expand, she (both the author and the character) seemed to grow tired of all that required effort. This resulted in a work that never seemed to attain its possibilities. The stylistic characteristics of the work were not enough to rescue it from this short-coming."
2,So disappointed,"First of all, it took me two weeks to get through this book. That is bad for me. Secondly, I could completely empathize with Carrie's need to find more in her life. To live her own life even if that meant hurting others. I could even understand her moving in with people she barely new and taking up with a new lover. I could not however understand why she did not follow through. I mean, I understand why she goes back to Wisconsin at the end of the book, but why on earth did she stay? Was it guilt? I felt as though the author rushed through the ending and didn't take the time to make me feel as though I understood her decision to stay in Wisconsin. It is not as though she was getting back together with Mike. Finally, just a little ""fat"" to chew on....who the hell is able to live in New York City for almost a year on $1,800 from a savings account with absolutely NO job!?! Even if she didn't have to pay rent no one could do that!"
3,A Little too crowded,"I just finished reading this book and came to Amazon to check out opinions... Packer has talent, but I kept wishing she had more focus, or a better editor, or something. The book felt about 100 pages too long. I liked the story and the characters, particularly Carrie's mother and Mike, but it seemed there were too many irrelevancies (such as Rooster getting married and the whole deal with Jamie's family). Some books feel rich with detail, this one just felt a bit crowded. Still worth reading, though."
3,Heart wrenching. In a bad way.,"I decided to read this book because of the good reviews. I plunged through it, reading and reading, waiting and waiting for Carrie to do the right thing. It left me feeling very sad and empty. The writing was good, but the characters were blah."
4,Really Enjoyed,"Yes, it has its flaws but I found this book to be really engaging and read it almost straight through over the holiday weekend. Couldn't put it down. I felt like the author really understood the 20-something mind--and yes, Carrie was mixed-up, illogical, self-centered at times. That's how it is at that age for many. I do wish the author gave us more with the character of Kilroy and that the ending offered Carrie a wider horizon, but those are minor complaints. Great story."
3,A Young Woman Ponders Her Life and Whether She Should Marry her Quadraplegic Fiance',"This book is okay. It starts off good but loses momentum. I found it most interesting for its inner dialogue.It is about a young woman whose fiance' becomes a quadraplegic after a diving accident. Prior to the accident, the relationship was troubled. After the accident, the young woman decides to leave her home town in order to work through her issues of whether to marry her fiance' or not. She wonders whether she feels obligated to marry him now that he is disabled. Would she have married him if he had not been in this accident?This book is very well-written but lacks a certain cohesiveness."
1,Marytrdom?,"I was only mildly interested in reading this book as I felt the writer was going to toy with us and she did. Ann Packer seemed to be determined to take us down a long and winding road, one that did not engage, only left the reader cold and frustrated. I feared what Carrie would choose to do and she didn't surprise. To give up the dream of going to fashion design school in NYC, and to leave a man she admits she still loves, smacks of guilt. Once I saw the predictable outcome, I stopped reading and skipped to the end, hoping I was wrong in my assessment. Unfortunately, it was predictably unimaginative. If you're looking for something philosophical, there are more appropriate choices."
4,I want to know more about Carrie and Mike!,"The book was very good for the most part. There were some slow sections, and Carrie was a little bit of a cold main character, but the book ultimately left me wishing it would not end! Packer's descriptions of the sewing and materials were so exceptional! I also loved the way she wrote about the cities, and the way she described people. Her writing flows easily! I want to know more about their story and if Carrie lets everyone down again."
2,A dull read...........,"I was anxious to read this book after hearing it reviewed on Good Morning America. They made it sound like the best book of the summer! I felt it started off well but never did much after the first few chapters. I did not like the main character, Carrie. Just could not relate to the choices she made and found her very self-involved. Also did not care for Kilroy who was very self-important.I made myself read the whole book in the hopes that it would get better. Carrie just seemed to float through life with no plans, no ambition and not much thought for her so-called friends! The end was also a disapointment."
1,Was it GMA that started the hype on this book?,I will never again follow a recommendation from them. This was painful to read. I read 150 pages and came to my senses and quit punishing myself. There wasn't a character I cared about or respected. This book should be tied to a boulder and pushed off the closest pier!
1,Yawn,"Cry, cry, I don't like my boyfriend anymore. Cry, cry, he's now paralized and I'm supposed to be with him. Cry, cry, I want to sew. Cry, cry, I run off to NY to be with a guy I met once - so what if he's twice my age & doesn't tell me anything about himself. Cry, cry, my girlfiend's sister is hurt. Cry, cry, I come back and now my engagement ring can be a friendship ring."
3,Frustrating book,"I found this book to be very frustrating. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what I dislike about the book. I identified with the protaganist immediately, having attended UW-Madison in my mid-twenties and experienced similar feelings of loneliness and worry about what to do with myself for the rest of my life. The writing of this book is good in most places, except for several odd juxtapositions that jar you out of the moment. It's the plot that I found hard to take. The protaganist's actions don't always ring true. I can understand her decision to leave Madison, although the way she does so is completely alien to me. But why take up with Kilroy? Why accept all of his oddities? And then, why abandon him too? I'm still puzzling that one over. And also why, in spite of all of the book's problems, I couldn't stop reading it until I found out what happened with Kilroy."
2,Characters have about as much depth as the water Mike breaks his neck in,"The main character Carrie, had absolutely no depth, she was selfish and really just disappointed every person in her life. The only character in this book I could stand was Kilroy, he was the the only one with any depth.In the end Carrie ends up exactly where she started, I doubt any wiser. This book was a waste of my time, avoid reading it if you can, maybe watch the movie that just came out on lifetime? It would take less time, and you could have that many hours back in your life"
1,pullease.,this was a pretty horrible read. the book started out with a bang and coasted down from there. what happened to kilroy?? sheesh.will everyone think less of her if she dumps mike? YES. is she mature and capable enough to deal with such a limited future. NO. adding the stress of caring for a paraplegic to an already failing relationship would be a recipe for disaster. compare this to the realization of her dreams - carrie was right on the brink of becoming what she was meant to be. from now on she can use all of that incredible fashion sense in the design of mike's nappies. gimme a break.
1,Like a sleeping pill.,"This book was a terrible dissapointment. The concept for this story was a good one and I looked forward to the internal conflict the main character would suffer and the ultimate resolution, but this book drags on and on and on until you just fall asleep waiting for something, anything, to happen. Carrie suffers from an internal paralysis that does come across in the story, but who would want to read about it? Mike, who is truly paralyzed, would have probably made for a much more interesting story. I have been using this book for a sleeping pill for two months and it is so effective it will probably last for at least another two."
2,Glurge,If you are looking for gripping drama keep walking.The best way to use this book is as a self help guide as Carrie (the protaganist) weighs choices for pages without end.Their was one character I cared about. One character in the bunch who was central enough to register and wasn't so emotional immature that I could care about his history.It led me to soul searching. But that was for more satisfying than the book itself.And the ending would've angered me to no end if I were emotionally invested enough in the characters to BE angry.I just felt I was wasting my time.To the Good?Packer captured the monotony of a life that has never changed nicely. The claustrophobia of sameness.The difficulty of making life altering decisions before you feel ready.But in the end?I didn't care about any of it.
4,Obligations,"This is a book about place and how the place we are defines us. It is a book about relationships and the battle to maintain the individual within those relationships. Where is the line between obligations to family and friends and lovers and responsibility to oneself? Carrie can't be a true daughter, friend or lover to anyone in the book until she has found her center. It is not clear by the end if she has but she is definitely walking in that direction."
4,"Good, quick read","I heard of this book via GMA's new book club. It was a good, quick read. I enjoyed the character's although at times, I found some of them a bit unbelievable. The author did write wonderfully. One of the things I enjoyed about this novel was it made you look inside and see what you would do if confronted with the same issue - Do I do what is expected of me or do I do what's best for me? ...I would recommend this book although I found the ending a bit predictable."
4,What happens when a lover is paralyzed,"What happens when a lover is paralyzedI have two friends who are married to paraplegics, and they say it ain't like this, that this tale is not realistic. But as a book, a story, The Dive from Claussen's Pier works just fine. What happens is that, right as their relationship is probably about to break up, the guy dives into water that's too shallow and is paralyzed. What will his girlfriend do? Will she stay the course, or will she take off and begin her life anew. Abandon him, or stand by her man? It's worth reading to find out, but the book dives deeper than just this superficial plot line. In beautiful prose, Ann Packer explores friendship, love, wisdom, and the hold the past has on the present."
2,Who cares?,"Carrie just lets life happen to her - everyone she comes in contact with knows what she will end up doing before she does. Lots of people just let life happen around them, but it doesn't make for a good read. Her only passion is sewing, and it doesn't make for a good read either. Don't waste your time."
2,Interesting points but mostly stagnant,This book introduced very common characters with common lives. Nothing spectacular. After the accident the main character takes a downward spiral into selfishness. She runs away from her problems abandoning all her friends and family back home but the storyline wasn't more interesting than that. She tries to reconcile but does a poor job because she's afraid and too self involved with her new lover. A slow story about nothing more than a girl who likes to sew and has no life after college.
3,It was a good story until the end,"I live in Madison, WI, and since everyone in town was reading this book and raving about it, I jumped on the bandwagon, too. I will say that the scenes describing Madison are very accurate and even the fictional settings (restaurants, etc) sound like they should exist here. It was the story, especially the ending (which I won't reveal) that surprised and disappointed me. As someone who ran away from the New York area to Madison, I can understand her motivation to leave everything and start out anew, even changing into a slightly different person in the process. It was her choice at the end I can't understand, the decision she makes doesn't make sense for her (or her friend Mike's) future. I feel like Packer flipped a coin at a certain point in the plot, and wrote an ending based on the heads-or-tails result."
4,Waiting for more from this author,"This is a sincere effort by a strong voice. I will certainly read this new author's next novel. Her descriptions of tired but enduring relationships rings so true it made me want to call up every childhood friend I've ever lost touch with to tell them how much they've meant to me and my personal growth. Her descriptions of the painful rift between Carrie, the protagonist, and her best friend Jamie were gut-wrenching and honest. This is a writer who likes her characters and treats them with dignity. I thought her descriptions of New York were on the money. I realize that a native New Yorker might find them trite and midwestern. But she perfectly captures the wide-eyed wonder those of us not from New York feel the first time we go there."
5,Great reading!,"Loved this book, it absorbed me, the 'travel' of the main character, finding out where she belongs. In in between this great surch also an easy read, pulling me from one page to another."
2,"Had big hopes for, but still hoping...","I am currently reading this book, and already struggling to get through it. I had also read all of the reviews, and was excited to begin reading. However, halfway through and I am already wondering how long it will take me to finish it. The beginning had promise, with the underlying currents in Mike and Carrie's relationship, the hot-headed best friends Rooster and Jaime, but I feel like the book is now wandering. All of the sudden Carrie is in New York hooking up with someone she met once in Madison. Huh? I am sure I will end up finishing this book, but I don't anticipate it being an outstanding reading experience."
4,Easy to get lost into,"I loved this book. It held my attention from the first word all the way to the end. It is really a book a person can get lost in the story and find themselves unable to put the book down to get to the end. I was a little disappointed in the ending, though. Seemed a bit cut off, but all in all a wonderful read."
3,Speaking of a dive...,"Actually I didn't find this book nearly as bad as some of the reviewers stated. Though I don't belong to a ""well rounded highly educated book group"", as one reviewer wrote, I do enjoy reading and found this book very well written. I didn't care for Carrie and probably wouldn't have her as a friend, but the story did keep my attention. It was well written and I would recommend it. If your'e looking for the Great American Novel, this isn't it. If you are however looking for a book that keeps your attention and entertains you, you won't be disappointed."
2,Disappointed.....,"Overall, I was disappointed. The idea was good and the plot and characters could have been much more developed without the cheap sex scenes. Ann Packer has talent, but needs to ""clean up"" her story lines. It's sad to me to see the lack of Christian standards in her characters."
4,Witty,"I'm reading this now and can hardly pull myself away from it. Incidentally, I wonder if Ann Packer designed the dust jacket, if that's her personal joke. Well, back to the book."
2,Too Much Angst,This novel is far too dark...and draggy...for me. One loses patience with the main characters about halfway through.
3,About 100 pages too long.,"I picked this book up when someone left it as a freebee at work, and after opening it at lunch I was hooked. I cruised through the first 200 pages, very moved by the story and conflict, and anxious to see the dramatic homecoming every reader knows is coming from the moment the main character takes off. But at about page 200 the book takes an unwanted turn into tedium, and becomes a slow process of the protagonist trying to figure out what she wants out of life--and I couldn't help feeling that the author was trying herself to figure out what she wanted out of the book. A hundred pages later the reader finally gets what was desired a 100 pages earlier, but by then it's a let down.Overall recommended, but could have been so much better."
4,A wonderful book!!!,"This was a great book, especially for a first novel. The author really explores the nature of relationships and the extent to which people owe each other something and owe something to themselves. I was a little surprised, and maybe disappointed at the ending, but I thought it was a very honest, real way to end the book. I think we are a little spoiled by Hollywood endings, and expect them all the time. Definitely a good read, and well worth the time."
5,"Really, Really Good","Rich in subtle, powerful images of love, loss, betrayal, duty and honour, this book is a provoking, haunting, yet joyful story.A spinal cord injury that has left Carrie Bell's fiancée, her high school sweetheart, paralysed for life. Shortly before the injury, both were having serious doubts about their relationship. They now must decide what to do with the rest of their lives, such as they are, in a small Midwestern town. The right thing to do--what would that be? Stick by your fiancé? Leave town? Such is the dilemma of Carrie Bell. Her fiancé, Mike, is the accident victim. Carrie must face many around her who will judge her in some way. Her own, fatherless family. Mike's family. Mike's friends. Their friends as a couple. Her own best friend. And everyone else in town who knows them. Ann Packer writes a compelling, fascinating tale of the difficult choices a young woman faces as she faces personal loss and the painful process of personal growth that follows."
2,zzzzzz....,"I thought Dive from Clausens Pier was one of the most boring things I have ever read in my life. Pages and pages of this book are spent describing sewing...and it's not a sewing manual. I thought surely that all the sewing talk would actually lead to Carrie's finding a new career, but no. Apparently, we just get to hear about it endlessly and it goes nowhere. Much like the rest of the book. Terrible."
4,I liked this book.,"This was not your typical chick lit book, but might have had a bit more depth to it. I enjoyed this book and had fun going on her journey with her. Not everyone or everything turned out perfectly, but it was a satisfying ending."
1,Don't waste your time,"I have never written a review before but this book was so laughably bad that I felt compelled. The book is a bad romance novel filled with shallow characters and cliches. The characters are shallow, superficial, and unbelievable. Carrie, the main character has the intellectual and moral capacity of a preteen. The circumstances of her life are neither believable nor compelling. I wanted to throw it out after 100 pages, but it was picked for my book group so I forced myself to finish it. I should have thrown it out..."
