4,A classic,"While the title may appeal to greed, the book is based on solid principles of integrity. I believe this book helped our country to recover from the depression, and the author was an adviser to FDR. There is a negative attitude toward religion expressed in one place, and I would skip the chapter on ""The sixth Sense"", and the author even suggests that some may want to skip this chapter, but the rest of the book is worth reading several times. He makes the point very well that riches, and everything else, whether it be good or evil, begins with thinking, and that's a lesson everyone should learn."
3,Dated information and too spiritual,"Not enough concrete advice. Its main focus is that ""if you believe it, it will happen."" If you support this philosophy, positive thinking will help more than this book."
5,A philosphical landmark,A truly great book. Incredibly philosophical with unrelenting wisdom. Becomes more and more compelling as you turn the pages.
4,Very Valuable Information,"Think & Grow Rich is an American classic that is literally one of the best selling books ever. In it, author Napoleon Hill offers his ideas on achievement and success. The book also shares many delighful stories used to illustrate certain lessons.Hill claims to have studied hundreds of notable achievers in formulating his principles of success. Most notable on the list is US steel king Andrew Carnegie, a man who went from being a poor US immigrant from Scotland to becoming one of the wealthiest people of all time.Altogether I would say that Think & Grow Rich is among the finest personal growth books there is, and a great read for anyone who believes in the beauty of their dreams.If you are interested in Think & Grow Rich, I would also recommend you read the book The Get to the Point Success Reader, which is a compliation of some of the premiere material by Hill and many other related authors."
5,Read With A Group,"First of all, of the various versions of ""Think and Grow Rich"" that are out there, this one is my favorite. The Editor has really done his homework to bring Napoleon Hill's Original work into historical context without bringing in modern day examples like other versions do.Secondly, I highly recommend reading this book at the rate of a chapter a week with a group study. I had read this book by myself before, but have really accelerated my Awareness by reading it every 3-4 months with a different group of people. You don't have to do it that often, but each time you read this book, you get more and more out of it!Finally, don't just read the book, but follow the specific instructions laid out in the book. This is the book that every success book out there is based on...it's the original. Do this, and you'll find greatness.Cheers from the Windy City,Ryan McIntyre"
1,don't buy this one,There are other versions I don't recommend because the table of contents is hot hyperlinked. This one is worse. It has no table of contents.
5,Well worth the cost,"While many of the suggestions in the book are very dated one can easily grasp the concepts and apply them to modern life.Although the book is nearly 70 years old most of the rules of life have not changed much.Only at the times when the author talks about using new typewriter ribbons and such does one realize how old the book is.I rate this a must own classic.Michael Del Greco, President - [...]"
4,Really good,This is such a classic. Definately something people should read over and over again. Getting it on mp3 is the best because you can listen to it in the car etc instead of all the normal radio garb that doesn't help you.
1,takes to long to get the product,"I liked the prices on Amazon ,but hated how long it took me to receive 1 Audio book & 1 dvd - I would rather pay more than have to way almost 2-1/2 week to receive what i paid for .You want the money upfront ,but cant get me what I paid for in a few days .I wont buy for Amazon again my time is valueable - Kim ESpinoza"
1,"What a useless, dreadful book","I am a CEO of a large investment firm. I think I have a pretty good idea of what makes me peopls sucessful. I think this book is deadful, misguided and an ineffectual map to guide someone to a role in leadership."
1,Dated Dated Dated,"For the 3rd time, I've tried to read this book. I can't. It's unreadable. Outdated, trite, and doesn't speak to me, here in the 21st century. Burn all your income bridges to reach a goal? How does that work in a recession? NOT."
3,Faith Teaching,"This book tends towards being a teaching on ""faith."" I liked some ideas on visualization and confession but some theories such as ""sex transmutation"" I found to be unhealthy and perverted. I think the practice of ""eating the meat and spitting out the bones"" could be applied towards this book."
5,Daily Growth,Think & Grow Rich is a great book for everyone. It might be a classic but it still reads true today. I have grown more aware of my history and why we do the things we are doing and to change those things to make us better human beings each and everyday. I will read this book again & again.
5,Best Book On My Bookshelf,"Napoleon Hill is one of the most influential authors I have ever had the pleasure of reading. After completing this book, I went on to read the 1,000+ page Law of Success. This man has a formula for success, and if you apply his principals in your life - you will, with out a doubt, achieve what ever it is you aim to do. If you want to change your life, buy this book."
1,Want to be one of those greasy sales guys - read this book!,"This book is the worst. I can only gather the people who have given it great reviews have little common sense or ethics for that matter. If you are striving to be one of those slimey car dealers or annoying telemarketers this is definitely for you. There is one point in the book where he tells a story of a disabled kid exploiting his disability to sell products. If that is not bad enough he spins the situtation so that his father rewards him for his actions - ""great job son, prey on peoples emotions and sympathy to sell them something not on if they need it, but for the guilt the feel as they see you there disabled."" Great stuff."
1,Not so good,"I am a big fan of self-help books and thought i would love this book after all the positive reviews but i just didnt get it. Maybe it's just me but this one was boring. I didn't make it past page 75 because nothing in the text seemed important enough to remember. It also really bugged me that he kept refering to thinking positive as a secret. Over and over again he tells us how the ""Secret"" will change our lives but he never seems to get to the point. Like i said, maybe it was just me and maybe i didnt read enough to fully grasp the book's concept, but this one was not a page turner. One book i recommend is Dr. David Schwartz's The Magic of Thinking Big."
1,The source of the book,"This book is an all time best seller for many reasons. It gives the reader what he/she wants to hear, a road map of success. However, I have learned the sources of his information came from some spiritual beings, nine of them in fact, that would sit at a table and talk to him. Crazy, yes, but true. He called them descendants masters. Because of that, I do not advise taking the advise espoused in this book"
1,Not very impressed,"The only one getting rich is Napoleon Hill. It's alot of feel good, lovey dovey thinking stuff that's suppose to help make you rich. Mind games if you will. It's just collecting dust on my shelf right now. Spend your money on more spirtual insights instead!"
5,Thinking produces results,"Positive thinking produces positive results and Optimal Thinking produces Optimal results. So read this brilliant book and Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self if you want to OPTIMIZE your finances, relationships and your life."
1,There are better editions of this great book.,"Think and Grow Rich is one of the best books ever written on the subject of personal development. Unfortunately, the copy of this edition I received was riddled with errors and typos. I'm not sure what happened, but you will want to avoid the Filiquarian edition of the book until they resolve things."
2,A potentially interesting book destroyed with stupid writing skills,"A sharp contrast with books like ""Poor dad, rich dad"", this book is a lot more ""Dr. Phil-like"" than a humble anecdotal and insightful book on personal financing.For one, this book doesn't hide the fact that it's meant to be an inspirational book rather than an educational book but these ""heroic stories"" worshipping quickly gets annoying.Compounding this is the fact that the book has been written with absolutely horrible sentences. A typical sentence sounds like ""you must employ that of which that will be of sorts which has been among which that can bring about the one that does that"". Absolutely ridiculous wordiness and use of unnecessarily long sentences ironically makes this book sound less credible"
5,Incredibly powerful principles!,"Indisputably a great book.Buy it, read it, practice the principles and become rich!!This book, unlike others, mentions providing service to others as an effective way to grow rich. Those principles were written in the 1960s but are still just as effective today."
2,No Table of Content,"This version is the complete and original version of the book by Napoleon Hill. The big problem is that it does not include the table of content and for this kind of books, the table of content is very very very important. I am going to delete it and buy another edition."
5,Think and Grow Rich,I love this audio book. I did not know what to expect but it is very informative and easy to listen to.
4,The Original Self Help Book,A classic that is the basis of many of the modern self help books. Well worth reading.
2,A Scam,This book was absolutely of no use. It is laughable how Hill suggests that people should not waste their sexual energy instead of 'trasnmuting' it into chasing their dreams. Bulls***.
1,Be careful,"My brother read this book and it warped his mind to say the least. No heart, friends or money when he died. All he did was talk and I mean non stop about how useless everyone was and how they were stupid for working for a living. He got insurance adjusters to take bribes, Vegas trips, women and sporting tickets non stop. After years of success they got caught and all the adjusters were fired and he was black listed in the insurance home repair business. He sent his wife off to work for 15yrs while he sat on his rear end ""thinking he was still in control"". He ended up a joke with no control over anyone. Last thing I told him was ""get a job""."
3,I wasn't wowed,"Think and Grow Rich, by Napoleon Hill, was an interesting read but it wasn't what I expected. Maybe I'm not quite ready for its lesson yet, or maybe the message fell flat because I've read several books written by and about billionaires. Whatever the reason, I get the message - hard work, drive and dedication - I just expected to be a bit more dazzled by its message."
5,This book should be required reading in every school!,"Wow! I am a big fan of the book The Secret, so I was surprised when I read this book and found it had all the same information, but was written 70 years earlier. I can now see that most authors are just copying this book. I love the way the author writes, it is so easy to read even though it was written so long ago. As the author has said in this book, this information really should be taught in every school - it is more important that any other subject one can learn. If you are a parent, buy either this one or The Secret for your children."
5,changed my life,"This book is truly inspirational and it has changed my life for the best. I'm happily married, have 2 beautiful children and own my business. The transformation didn't happen overnight and involves constant work but I'm happily devoting time to this rewarding and fruitful ""obligation"""
5,The best book I have ever read.,"If there is anyone out there that is lost, stuck or unsure about their direction or purpose in life. This is a MUST read. It has helped me more than I could have ever imagined. The best investment I have ever made. I hope it can help you as it has helped me."
4,"Good book, don't buy the audio version","This is a great book, it is so amazing how a book written in the early 1900's can be so relevant today. Most of the teachings and opinions by the author have actually came true over time or were warned about. If only we had a society like the one taught in this book. Do not buy the audio book version as the narrator is worse than listening to a high school math teacher."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I read this book because in all the investment and self motivational books I've read it's been recommended. What I found were a lot of outdated examples from Eddison, and Ford. The title says it all. If you think and believe you'll grow rich, you will. There I just saved you from having to order this book.I do however reccommend the rich dad poor dad series I preferred that and was far more motivated."
2,Boring as f$#% and completely out of date.,"Maybe it's just that there have been 70 years of other motivational books, but everything in this book seems painfully cliche, racist, classist, outdated, and condescending. I can see where he's going within the first paragraph of every chapter, and it's all drek that's been restated in motivational books for years.I've read better advice in fortune cookies, and seen better writing on internet message boards. I can't really recommend not buying this because hey, it's under ten bucks, and if you're the kind of person who needs a kick in the a#@ to use common sense, it may actually help you, in its own half-retarded 1930s sort of way."
5,"Powerful Book. Great review by Wally ""Famous"" Amos!","I first was introduced to this great book by Napolean Hill back in 1975. Using the principles and strategies as taught by Napolean Hill made a tremendous difference in my life. Over the last 30 years I have met many very successful people including Wally ""famous"" Amos and everyone admitted that this book had an immeasureable effect on their lives.For me, I was able to go from a 3 year old Ford Pinto and a job paying $4/hr to a brand new Lincoln Continental Mark V and making $2,000 per month (in 1970's $$$) in under 6 months.And I really enjoyed the review by Wally ""famous"" Amos. Wally, I don't know if you remember me but we met briefly back in 1991 in Winter Park Florida. We had several things in common including our love for positive mind books like this one and good old southern cooked Grits. Great review Wally and what a testiment to this book!Think and Grow Rich is a classic for a reason, it works."
5,think and grow rich,"Its a great tool for increasing the capability of undestanding and develop the assertiveness and effectiveness. In chapter 7 where you are talking about the blessings that we have to understand, you are focusing about USA economical situation. I would appreciate if you share with me, how can I find the blessings in a country who has an increasing scale of corruption, where we do not have the same opportunities such as in USA. F.E. Mexico. I mean for the most common people in here. Actually I work in empowerment techiques, and I would like to use as a tool your book,this specifical title; because I liked it very much, and I really consider it, as a great step for increasing the knowledgment of the success. But I would like you to tell me, if its possible, how can I find information as real as you did in the mentioned chapter. I will appreciate your advisor about this matter. Thank you very much. isabelp62@yahoo.com"
5,GREAT AUDIO-CD,THIS BOOK CAN CHANGE YOU LIFE!THIS AUDIO THE COMPLETE BOOK OF NAPOLEON HILL IN MP3 HELP ME TO REMEMBER THE BOOK BY HEARTUNABRIDGED EDITION
3,BEWARE! It's about 80 years old!!,"This book was OK. I was recommended to it by a colleague. It was written back in the 30's (it refers to the ""rock stars"" of the corporate world as Henry Ford and Andrew Carnegie and Thomas Edison!). Good, time-tested ideas. Especially on persistence. However, alot of it was quite boring and outdated. I felt as if I was reading it just to get through it and not truly enjoying it and learning from it. As previously mentioned, the chapter on persistence was the one exception. Great advice there. Overall.....not bad, but not great."
3,The wrong book..,"I put a three star review to be fair since I received another book instead. The book has the same cover featured on this site (the person on top of a mountain - red cover) however the Christmas Carol story (Scrooge and all) was the text.I am assuming this is a printing mistake, but since I paid around $2 for this book I won't be returning it.I suggest that you order the other versions of this book and pay the few extra bucks.Peace."
2,Factually incorrect,"I stopped reading at page 20, when the author states, in his list of people who ""didn't know it was impossible so they did it anyways"", that Beethoven was deaf. He was most certainly not deaf -- he did end up completely deaf and composed some of his great works during that period, but to state this way that ""Beethoven was deaf"" does not bode well for the other token examples whose lives I am less familiar with, and less prone to fact-check."
3,It was informative.....,"I didn't understand most of it. Nothing made sense, I was so eager to get this book. I read the secret, this is just a replica."
3,have not had time to read this yet.,"I've read that this is a really good book, I have not began to read it yet.I will try to make time for it, since this money subject is important to me."
4,Think and Grow Rich,"Informative.But do your own research too ,according to current market. Expanded reading is recommended for comparison.Otherwise,a good reading for someone in market speculation."
2,Couldn't keep reading,"Maybe I didn't give this enough chance. I got about 30% into the kindle version, and the old fashioned language was too much for me. The book was boring and I couldn't keep my attention on it. Now I got rich dad, poor dad..and though I'm oly 25% into it, its a book thats more appealing to me. I'ma in my early 30's so this type of book appeals to me more."
4,Classic,This book is a classic that I read twenty years ago and wanted to have my own copy as I think it is a good reference for self-improvement. It has stood the test of time.
3,some good ideas,"I have two copies of this book and I think there are some good chapters in this book . My favorite part is in chapter 14 , ""let great men shape your life "". I like the idea of having ""Invisible Counselors"". The imagination can be a powerful influence."
4,Still a classic motivator,"Having read ""Think and Grow Rich"" many years ago, I bought the DVD so it could be listened to in the car. I enjoy listening to it and I do believe that if one puts the methods to work it can make a huge difference in your success in every area of life. I do think I would enjoy it more if the speaker were more animated... Mr. Hill himself tends to be a bit dry, but if you can get past the sound of his voice and listen to what he's saying, the content is fabulous."
4,great read,i enjoyed this book.full of facts and info and keep me reading.im not rich yet but im surely thinking about growing rich.its very interesting
3,Heavy reading,A friend of mine recommended this book to me a while ago. I got it but have not been able to really get into it. It seems like heavy reading to me and its written in a riddle format that I find a bit frustrating. The writer keeps referring to this secret thats going to jump out at me... I have kind of given up on it for now. will revisit at some stage and re post with update.
2,Not so sure!,I got the wrong version! I wanted the one with the cover just like it displayed on the picture but instead got the old version of Think and Grow Rich. Of course I have read and reread the book but wanted this new version that has larger printing... oh well! I guess I will have to give it to someone and try again.
4,Quite good.,"Althought this book is small and cheap, there is a lot to read (the font is quite small) and plenty of very useful points.The main theme is that everything evolves from the mind. The book describes how you can use this fact to bring you wealth using the conscious and subconscious.Book is very thorough on this topic, almost too much so.One of the finer points is that you have to remove any negative subconscious thoughts you have about money. Your wealth must be obtained in a just and honest way such that all you have transacted with have benefited.Many other good points and mental ""methods"". Can be applied to wealth building and life in general. Recommended."
5,Best Version of Think & Grow Rich!,"This version offers a lot more as it helps you understand more about Napoleon Hill himself and insights into the people he mentions in his book. Think & Grow Rich is a great classic and this is almost like a study guide included into the book.I highly recommend it, even if you have another version!"
5,The best book I've ever read,This book was outragous because it made more confident and secure. It also made me focus on achieving my goals in life.-Santiago Antunez
4,Valuable insights but suboptimal,"This book is is an example of suboptimal positive thinking. Hill's concepts are valuable because he understands that we become what we think about. But Hill uses the old paradigm of positive thinking which has many shortcomings. Nowadays, positive thinking has been superceded by Optimal Thinking. People and organizations who seek the best results (optimal thinking) are no longer willing to settle for good and great results (Suboptimal positive thinking). If you want tooptimize your success (not just improve it) you have to read ""Optimal Thinking: How to be your best self."" You learn how to to be your best in every situation and bring out the best from others and achieve the best possible results. You discover that positive thinking is often no more than wishful thinking. Needless to say, there are many good insights in Think and Grow Rich which you should not overlook."
2,Inspirational...but this conversion is shocking!,"I agree that this Kindle conversion is shocking...but by now I expect most people would spend just a few dollars more for a 'proper' version.In my opinion, you're better off spending a similar amount of money onNapoleon Hill's Hidden Secret In Think And Grow Rich: Why This Law Of Success Principle Proves The Master Keys To Successas it's the perfect complement to the original and certainly got me thinking about how clever Napoleon Hill really was!"
5,Excellant,great book! I would reccomend this book to people with adesire to be positive and to set goals for themselves. Webecome what we think about the most.
3,"Good, but....","I've heard a lot of motivational, educational, and financial audiobooks in my day, and while this one is a classic, I was disenchanted by the readers style of delivery. The readers monotone energy becomes tiring after an hour of listening. And he pronounces 'Socrates' (the philosopher)...like the guy on Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. You know, 'SocrATES'.The material seems to be centered around the want for money, money, money without much focus on WHY you want the money for yourself....like a blind faith that acquiring money is the end all be all."
1,Don't waste your time!!!,This is an example of one bad apple. A $5.00 book and they could not produce the product? I contacted these folks twice with no response. It's a shame that people like this give Amazon a black eye. Amazon did give me credit though.
1,disatified,"I am very unhappy with the purchase I made, I recieved the wrong product, followed the process to make it right and the merchant/sender never sent the right item, so now I am out my money and I have an old beat up cd that I did not order, I will never order anything on Amazon again."
1,Think and Grow Rich DECEPTION!!!,"This book fooled me for quite awhile. This book was written by Napoleon Hill, a man who was deceived by the spirits into thinking this is helping others, and for some time I thought it was helpful and included great teachings of the Bible and Jesus Christ. But beware this is book is based on the occults belief that you should work on the self but Jesus says deny thyself. Before purchasing this book do some research and at the very least go on YouTube and watch Dave Hunt and Johanna Michaelsen videos on this topic. I'm a new born Believer and can't go into full details but this is something you want to steer away from. Hope this helps. God Bless."
5,UNLOCKING THE MASTER MIND FOR $1 BILLION,"I read THINK & GROW RICH OVER 25 years ago.I recommended it to_thousands & taught it. I madeMillions. happiness & contentment eluded me. On October 30, 2012 my wife borrowed Think & Grow Rich from the public library and gave it to me. I had zero money. I read it:I AM HAPPY & MATURE NOW & WILL GIVE MY LIFE ENERGY TO A GREAT MANY OTHERS. I ALREADY HAVE MADE$20, 000, 000 in ONE DAY (11/3/12) !!!DOC C"
3,Great Book so far but book is totally unbinded.....,"I didn't know I was buying a book that is not held together (unbinded) seems to be so old that tough to read and hold the pages together, LOLbut its worth the READgreat bookI highly recommend buying a nicer or NEWer one to read"
4,Great Book!,"This book is a great tool! Use it to train yourself how to think in ways that will make you successful in business and in life. Fun to see how despite being written a long time ago, the ideas transcend."
4,Awesome!,Awesome book. So far it has helped me think differently about howto be successful. Think and Grow Rich is an amazing book written by an amazing man.
3,Not bad,"There are some good concepts in the book, but there are also some that seem a little strange to me."
4,Good book,"I thought it was a good book. Mr Hill brought up some extremely good points and I was very challenged by the book. The main things I didn't like about it were his focus on getting rich and his self-help philosophy. Bringing recognition, respect and love of the God of the Bible is the only ultimately worth while life goal. And He is the only one who can help me attain that goal. I can make myself a perfect man. I agree with the majority of the principles that Mr. Hill laid out, but they are not original to him. They written in the Bible for anyone interested in looking for them.Good book. I'm planning to re-read it."
5,It Works,Got me motivated so now I'm signing up for college at age 40 to learn to do what I really want to do. No excuses just plans.
1,Misprints galore,I agree with the review about the misprints. There were so many blatant errors that it affected the readability. The proof reader should have been transferred to another job.
5,One of the best investments you can make,"There's a good reason why this book is such a classic... It works!Read it, think about it and then do it. :)"
5,Definite Chief Aim.,Definite chief aim is the No 1 key to become a millionaire. People with definite chief aim will NEVER quit to achieve their goals. They will persist and persist and never quit until they succeed. This is what Think and Grow Rich is all about. Remain absolute focus on your Definite Chief Aim.
2,No this is not the full edition!! Chopped up text.,"This is not the original full edition!! Don't be fooled this is an edited edition. This is chopped up and all his real secrets are edited out of this! My edition of this book, a hardcover edition published by Tarcher/ penguin says ""the complete classic text"" and is 373 pages!! Look for the complete classic text or orignial 1937 edition and you will be very surprised."
4,Outstanding book,"Loved this book. The principles found in it are sound and time proven. Highly recommend this book. Will say that it can be a challenging read for some, due to the ""datedness"" of the text."
5,"Its not the kind of book you expect, its better!","The most impressive part of this book to me is where Hill encourages one to gather a bunch of experts in the next dimension (people who have died for exa) and have them give guidance during meditation. I gathered a committee such as Cayce for clairvoyance, Shakespeare to help me with writing, John Lennon with music, etc. Its fun to meditate, having these and others talk together and help me. He is a cool author! And the stuff he suggests, works. Linda Schiller-Hanna"
5,A must have- read it at least once a year,"I've read so many business and success related books and this is by far the staple of my collection. The concepts in this book lay the foundation for growth and development. It seems kind of pointless to try to become an expert in any one field without first understanding and practicing these basic principles. Despite it's age, it is timeless and relevant. An added bonus is that it's remarkably easy to read, digest and understand."
4,Book For Class,Great book has a lot of good tips in it though some of the stories associated are pretty lengthy.I would recommend for a good side read but they should make an updated version with more relevant stories
5,A timeless classic,Some things never change and the words of Napoleon Hill could change your life forever. My grandfather recommended this book to me as a young teenager and I love it now as much as I did then.
1,Five Stars,"The fact that you are here, reading negative reviews, is the very reason you should own this book. A great buy."
5,"Think and Grow Rich, a great book with great advice.","The book trains the mind to think affirmatively and work toward more success and a better future, it would be of benefit to everyone who has ambition to improve himself or herself. Dave Cobb."
5,Life Changing !!!!,"This book is the mother of all books written based on ""Thoughts become things !!"" but to my surprise this book also give methods to create your own world in mind and bring it to life. May be a Abridged version should be thought in schools !!"
2,Over Rated Hype,"I bought this book because it was touted as the ""bible"" at many of the financial seminars and wealth seminars that I attended. I believe in the concept of the book, but it is outdated, repetitive and boring. I have been carrying the book around with me for over a month now, half read, and only read from it when I can not find a free newspaper at the train station."
5,Still the best,"Napoleon Hill's gift to each of us who reads and rereads this astounding life recipe is priceless. I remain in awe of his rigour, insight and persistence. If you haven't read this book, buy it now, read it and read it again. Then do Hill's exercises exactly as he advises and the world will shift beneath your feet."
4,Think And Grow Rich,"An excellent book which could use an update, some of its language is archaic but the message is clear."
5,A Book No Library Should Be Without,"From the days of my youth, Dad had this book in his collection. It took me awhile to latch on but boy am I glad I did. I've watched this book change peoples' lives and bring them success (success is personal - success in whatever it is that you believe defines it). The title is not what it seems; a depiction of some get rich quick scheme, but a way of life. Read it. Read it over and over, and I guarantee you'll come away with a new cognition each time. Then, apply it. I highly recommend you buy this and keep it by your bedside along with the bible."
2,Good ideas at a very basic level,"Well, I rate this book pretty low, even though I like what it says. But then, it's been said so often already in so many places before.If you never thought about money and your own emotional and mental relationship to money, this book is a good read. But then, I would suggest you read David Boyle's ""The Little Money Book"", which actually gives facts and history to that thing that makes the world go round. And you will be surprised reading it."
2,Bad edition of fantastic book,"This is a fantastic book which is already changing my life, but unfortunately this edition has many typos and errors. This classic work is now in the public domain, meaning anyone can publish it without copyright issues. Unfortunately, some companies seem to take a lazy approach of putting out low-quality editions for a low price. Please avoid this one. Besides simple typos, I've found places where an entire line was apparently left out. (From what I can tell a text was scanned and processed through OCR.)I'm going to try ""Think and Grow Rich!: The Original Version, Restored and Revised"" since the description suggests that no changes were made to the text, but an index and footnotes were added."
5,Change your Thoughts Change your Life,"A revision of this book is needed as I felt women were pretty harshly represented as a minority, but if you skip past that the book is an eye opener to someone who WANTS to change their life. The only form of motivation is self motivation, so don't bother reading it if you are looking for a quick fix.THE BIG IDEA: Change your thoughts change your lifeTHE OTHER IDEAS: There is a process to success (outlined in the book) and it flows a little like this Thought, Desire, Faith, Action, Persistence.WHAT I GOT: The concept of the 6th sense stuck out to me as most important and has had meaning in my life. Another term for it would be Flow and feeling what it is like to have mind, body, spirit aligned. Magic happens!"
4,Think and grow happy,"A classic in the self-help field, this book was definetely worth the money. It's a book you'll want to read many times over. Although I can't say it changed my life, it certainly set me on the right road. It introduces some universal laws of happiness, wealth and success that anyone looking for answers should know. The only negative aspect I can think of is the dated and rather stilted writing style but, hey, it was written over 40 years ago so that can be forgiven. If you're interested in getting rich or just getting your life in order, this is an excellent place to start."
3,Strange statements,"There are great tips, but some of the statements are really strange. Example:""The ether is a great cosmic mass of eternal forces of vibration. It is made up of both destructive and constructive vibrations ...""No comment!"
4,Timeless source of Motivation...,"There are certain books that I have read over the course of my life that I come back to on occasion because the information remains relevant and valuable. Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill is one of those books. I have read it several times in paperback (most recently last year) and because I see it as more of a resource than just a book, I just purchased a copy of the book for my Kindle to have on hand at all times.Some of the information is dated (like the section on how to apply for a job in the original 1937 version). Despite this fact I prefer the original. It demonstrates the change in attitude about business and the way that services are provided as a result of the Great Depression. If you have never read a motivational book, or you are interested in becoming a business man, I highly recommend this book![...]Be a Cop!"
5,A Sound Philosophy,"This book is an absolute must for anyone interested in self improvement. It has to be read at least three times before the whole hidden message sinks in but once it does nearly everything can be seen in a different light. I was skepticle when I first got it but repeated readings have convinced me that this man knew what he was talking about. Its message which is largely subtle but very profound is as relevant today as it has ever been. It's worth hearing and knowing; that's the challenge, ""knowing it!"""
5,In this book you will find the magic ...,"The ideas espoused in this classic frequently come to mind - even years after reading. It is touted to be one of the most influential books of all time in pointing the way to personal achievement. In it you will find the magic of organized planning, self-direction, auto-suggestion, and master-mind association. Thousands of persons have applied this famous philosophy for a changed life."
5,Think and Grow Rich,"This is one of the best books ever written about how to successfuly obtain our objectives. It provides practial tools for creating the right mindstate and conditions to achieving one's desires and goals. This collection of experiences, insights, and guide lines to operate by (metaphysical laws?), in my opinion, whithstands the test of time."
5,Get this edition,"If you are going to buy Think and Grow Rich get this copy. Not only is it the original text completely unabridged, but the presentation is phenomenal. I have about three other copies of this book because if I was stranded on a desert Island with one book this would be it. But this edition is absolutely beautiful and the owner will treasure it appropriately. Enjoy its timeless and priceless wisdom."
2,This book is incorrectly described.,"I notice that this book is described on these web pages as ""unabridged."" This is patently incorrect. I have a copy of ""Think and Grow Rich"" that was published in 1947, and I can tell you with absolute certainty that this newer version is an abridged version. There are numerous sections and much information that have been left out. A lot of this is outdated stuff, but to call this newer book ""unabridged"" is just plain wrong."
5,The Standard Classic,"Thouhts are things. This book is the standard. Napolean researched the top minds of his time and brings to this book, how these peoples belief systems work to obtain success. If you want more out of your life, this is the book to help you gett their. I recommend this book highly."
3,It's simply to outdated,"Years ago I bought the original think and grow rich, but, then I sold it. Then one day I was online and saw the book again and downloaded it for free!!!!! I printed it off my computer and started to read it only to realize why I got rid of my copy in the first place. The information is too outdated and can't be understood and appreciated as a newer version could. The action pack version is better. Leave this one alone. If you must google for it and find a free download."
5,"I would rate more stars, but 5 was only option!","THE HOLY QURAN IS NON-COMPARABLE, SO THIS BOOK IS FAR SECOND BEST IN THE WORLD. IF I HAD TO BE A BUM SOMEWHERE, AND WOULD ONLY ALLOWED ONE POSESSION, THIS BOOK IS WHAT I'D CHOOSE TO HAVE BECAUSE THE KNOWLEDGE IT PROVIDES WILL ENABLE TO ME TO HAVE WHATEVER OTHER POSSESSIONS I DESIRE. STUPID PEOPLE WILL NOT UNDERSTAND THIS BOOK. THEY WILL NOT LIKE IT. THE ACT OF READING THIS BOOK IS NOT WHAT MAKES YOU SUCCCESSFUL, BUT THE *ACT OF APPLYING IT'S PRINCIPALS* WILL. THE SECRET IS *NOT* THAT YOU ""HAVE TO BE OBSESSED WITH MONEY"", BUT IT'S THAT ""YOU ARE WHAT YOU THINK"". IF YOU THINK POVERTY, THAT IS WHAT YOU WILL BE AND IF YOU THINK WEALTHY THEN YOU WILL BE. IF YOU CALL IT ""OBSESSIVE"" SO BE IT! BETTER TO BE OBSESSED WITH RICHES THAN TO BE OBSESSED WITH POVERTY! ;P"
2,"Great book, if it's what you're looking for.","After I read this book, I did not feel much smarter or richer, mainly I felt more experienced and wise. By the title, I thought that this book would give tips and advice on how to earn money. Instead, it was more of a book on the power of positive thinking and what not. Make sure you know what you want to read about before you buy this book. Other than that, it was well written and presented."
5,A Must,"Read it, re-read it and re-read it again. Give it as a gift. Ask your teen agers if they have read it. Read it. Mark it up. Incorporate it into your life. You will have splendid results."
4,Not the original 1937 version but 1938/2007,The original version was changed and republished. This is changed version. It is not the same as the original.If you want to understand all the manifestation people talk about these days the go to the source. The original Nepoleon Hill work is what it is all based on. Unfortunately this has some of the critical elements missing to manifesting ones dreams.
5,Must Have...,"This is a must have book. It goes directly to the point of human growth and developement for a successful person. It was written more than 50 years ago yet the information and direction is timeless. No technology can ever replace it. The audio CD is in an MP3 format and fits easily on 1 disc, yes, that's right, the whole book on 1 CD. Great to drive around and listen to the good stuff."
1,Very Disapointed,"I couldn't even make it through half of it it was so dry. I didn't realize this was written 50+ years ago and recommends strategies like repeating phrases daily (a little far fetched for me).I recently listened to the audio version of ""The Millionaire Mind,"" and found it much more interesting."
3,Sorry to say this,But the ending was so bad that I can't recommend this. I still don't understand the ending. It was a lot of fun going into the last hour or so and then it just fell apart. Don't want to spoil anything but what was a wonderful movie fell with a gigantic thud. Buy My Lovely Samsoon. That movie was great. Actually all the K-dramas are great.
5,Exercise DVD As Promised,"I was very happy to receive the Turbo Jam DVD, which was a great buy, was in excellent condition and was shipped very promptly."
2,Underwhelming,"This book is good I guess, I just expect so much more from Lisa Kleypas. She is an extremely talented writer that can really sink her teeth into a character and create a real emotional experience for her reader that resonates truth. The story begins with the main character dealing with the death of her husband. She is living with her inlaws, and raising her daughter. Not the best of sitiuations. I really liked the concept of going on when life deals you a terrible hand of cards I just felt the story could have been so much more given Klepas's talent."
4,"A good book, a FABULOUS hero...","""Where Dreams Begin"" is certainly not my favorite Kleypas, but the hero, Zachary Bronson, is truly one of her best. I was so taken with him from page one that even though the story didnt grip me as much as I wished, I wasnt disappointed. I will admit that Lady Holly's reluctance to love him was maddening and I felt that the ending was dragged out a bit. All in all, this wasnt my favorite, but Zachary's heady mix of pride, strength, gentleness, and pure sex appeal elevated this book to much more than mediocre."
2,IF YOU HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO READ....,"I really enjoyed Kleypas' last book--Someone to Watch Over Me. Lots of character development and a plot. I felt that this book was lacking both. It was not a complete waste of my time, but I really felt nothing for either character. I was kind of distracted with the presence of the heroine's daughter. Needless to say, I will not be rereading this book or keeping it."
4,Almost Perfect,"I loved this book, but I was left feeling a little disappointed. I think she needed more on the heroine and and hero (more about their inner feelings) but it was still great read."
1,Different book than picture,The book pictured is not the book I received; has a different cover. I ordered this book because I specifically wanted the cover of the book pictured; instead I received the re-issued cover.
2,Not her best,I have liked some of this author's books but this was not one of them. I think the decision to take the position in Bronson's home and let the entire ton think she is his mistress is unreasonable to begin with especially since she has a young daughter. She isn't destitute and desperate which would have made it more reasonable. It would make Rose only eligible to marry a fortune hunter who didn't care that her mother was a rich man's mistress at one time. I also question the hero's morality since he conducts his irresponsible sexual life in front of his mother and his sister in his home. Then when Holly puts her foot down about that while she and her daughter are living in the house he goes off whoring to London every night. Ick. I just didn't like either the h or the H very much.
4,Romantic getaway delight,Audiobook- 5 star narrationA young widow broken and still deeply in live with her husband must learn to live again after three years of mourning. She braves society's judgment to take a chance that will give her daughter a better future in life and may give her one as well.A beautiful story of looking beyond what others expect of you-Taking a chance even if the outcome looks grim. What a roller-coaster ride.
4,Loved it!,"I loved this book. The only negative, and not a big one, is the ending could have been different. Other than that, this book was great."
3,Likable characters but not much story,"This is the first book I've read by this author. The characters were likable and the dialogue very good at times, but I kept waiting for something to happen. A twist, a surprise? There were none, just a predictable romance. Not much originality at all. If you've ever read a romance, you know Lady Holland will take the job, therefore putting her under the hero's roof. How many times have you read that? Just like the heroine's little girl is immediately adored by hero, who is obviously going to be the perfect father for her. The scandal, which I thought would be a big part of the story, never truly happens. You have a string of incidents and not much conflict. This book is like drinking a glass of warm milk. Good if you need something to make you sleepy. However if you're looking for a really cool Hurricane, keep searching."
3,Not as sharp as previous books,Although this book was very entertaining it did not have the sharp witty dialogue of her previous books.
5,Wonderful read,I love Lisa Kleypas. She is a very descriptive and creative writer. Her stories feel authentic. I enjoy her stories and this was one of my favorites. I usually favor Johanna Lindsay and Nora Roberts. I ran out of those stories and was searching for a new author. Lisa Kleypas's ability ranges between those two authors.
4,"Warm, sweet, enchanting....","Once again, Lisa Kleypas gave me a couple to sigh over.... I fall for ALL of LK's characters!Although some of Lady Holly's actions didn't seem in character for her, I thought she showed a lot of intelligence about deciding to secure her & her daughter's futures. I REALLY appreciate intelligent characters. I like the kind of friend she was to the ladies, & especially the wonderful mother she was to Rose.Zachary was just too lovable.... manipulative - Yes - but lovable none-the-less. His sense of design & decor was too funny to be believed... I chuckled more that once over that. His sense of family loyalty & the way he interacted with Rose (Holly's daughter) just helped to make him a man to sigh over....If you like sweet, sweet romances, then you just can't beat the warm & fuzzy feelings (did I mention hot feelings too??) that a LK historical romances gives you."
2,Bad writing will kill a story,"This book was a ok until the end. Everything after the wedding (the last 70 pages or so) felt like a quick add-on to the rest of the story, complete with bad writing and everything. If that last part hadn't been there and the story stopped at the wedding, I might have given this book 3 stars."
4,Kleypas rocks,Lisa Kleypas can write a story!!! We are rooting for Zack and Holly right from the start but still wonder if they will overcome all the obsticles. This didn't get a 5 star rating from me only because I had trouble believeing that Holly would work for Zachary. But the story sizzled with suspence and romance.
4,Lisa Kleypas Never Lets Us Down,"Compared to other books, this book is really 5 stars. But compared to Lisa's other books it's 4. Lisa Kleypas is an amazing writer and in a class all her own. Just look at the ratings of all her books. This book was such a good read. I laughed and cried and sat tense in my seat while reading it. In fact, I just read it again for the second time and enjoyed it just a much as the first time."
4,Sweet & Enjoyable,"From the very first sentence the pages roll very smoothly. The writing is excellent. Holly, a wonderful sweet loving woman. Zachery Bronson-Strong man with emotional compassion ,who does not need to ever apologize for his beginnings. Rose-the sweetest little girl with a most unique collection of buttons. What a genious idea ! I do believe Ms. Kleypas has written enough books on this line (but glad she wrote this one). She needs to go forward with her great imagination and give us some other wonderful stories to discuss and keep in our minds forever. I will keep this book in my collection and will look forward to read her future books. Marylin F. Graham"
2,Where Dreams begian,"I was so excited--a new Lisa Klepas. But alas this isn't true. This book was first published in 2009. The last ""new"" Lisa Kleypas--was also an old book repackaged ""Love Come to Me"". I love Lisa's books--I've bought everyone--sometimes more than once. I just hate it when I rebuy. Shame on me for not checking Pub dates. Shame on the publishers for leading me astray with new packaging and big prices."
3,Ordinary,There was nothing special about this novel. In fact the heroine was somewhat irritating b/c she was still longing for her dead husband for half the novel. I expected better from a kleypas novel.
2,Not nearly as good as the Contech brand,"I have three motion detecting sprinklers, two made by Contech (ScareCrow) and one by Havahart. Both of them are excellent for repelling deer (two years of experience with high deer pressure) but the Contech ScareCrow is more dependable. Although the Scarecrow sprinkler is more expensive, it is worth the price. The Havahart does not come with a guarantee other than a 30 day return policy whereas the Contech ScareCrow sprinkler has a two year warranty and they stand behind it. I had one fail after 22 months of use and they replaced it promptly. Also the motion detecting range, sensitivity, and adjustment is more stable and dependable in the Contech ScareCrow. The only time I've not had the ScareCrow work was during a period of very high humidity during some rainy weather when it failed to go off during a period of less than a day. On the other hand the Havahart motion sprinker is much more erratic in its performance and sometimes fails to work for brief periods."
4,Works Great...Once you get it set up.,"I bought this item as a way to keep rabbits out of rose bushes. I was skeptical when I bought it, but thought I would try it.Took us a while to fine tune the motion sensor and the sprayer. We have it by our front porch, and didn't want to spray ourselves as we walked to the front door!We've had it set up for over a month, and as far as I can tell, the rabbits haven't gotten close to the roses!Word of caution: If the spray range is set too narrow, the sprinker tends to get stuck and doesn't move back and forth. Setting the spray range wider seems to correct the problem."
4,Havahart Spray Away Motion Sprinkler,"When I eventually got it working to ""defend against cats"" it worked Well ...however the top adjustments are too delicate and one of the units broke almost imediately ...(as I live in new Zealand it's too much mucking around to send it back to the USA)But the one remaining unit is great..."
4,Works great,I have had mine for a year now. I decided to review after seeing all of the negative reviews here since mine works very well. Once you get the sensitivity and spray pattern set there were no issues at all. The cats stay out of my garden and the racoons away from the pond. Battery life is about 4 months if it's used a lot. The only negative is that on windy days swaying branches set it off.
4,animal protection,Worked as advertised and kept the deer and rabbits away from my roses. After about 4 weeks the battery went dead and deer ate half my roses again. It operated a lot in that time but I wish there was a way to know when to change the battery other than standing in front of it.
4,Havahart vs Scarecrow,"I have 3 SCARECROWS and 1 Havahart for deer deterrent. I find the havahart to work well for my problem and it to be more controllable against tree wind movement. And less $$I have them hooked up to an automatic sprinkler valve and set the timer to be on all night long, avoiding the accidental spraying of me, the gardener or mailperson."
2,spay away - bad water connection,"The motion activated spraying worked fine. However the connection of a watering hose to the unit leaked constantly. I tried 2 differnet hoses, then added a hose washer into the threaded portion of the unit, then tried using teflon plumbing tape on the end or the watering hose threads. None of those worked. The unit leaked noticeably at the hose connection and was a constant waste of water."
3,Not a great deterrent for squirrels or ground hogs.,"The price on-line was much less than local retailers. It senses motion very well. However, you need more than one to surround a garden. Squirrels learn very quickly how to enter the garden undetected. Groundhogs seem completely undeterred. Havahart traps work much better for both."
2,motion sprayer from china,The product came in assembled wrong. It sprayed all the time. I had to disassemble it and change the valve spring assemble position on the electric valve piston.
3,Sensitivity irratic but entertaining,"We enjoy our sprayer but often goes off when we see nothing around, and then won't spray when one of us is right in its path. HOpefully no predator gets our fish on the ""off"" moments. Needs to be staked in ground or falls over. Overall it is fine, but not excellent."
4,DEER REPELLENT,"After trying home and commercial 'aromatic' brews to repel deer with either poor or no results, I ordered Havahart 5265 water repellent. It has, so far, lived up to its advertised effectiveness. I have had no deer intrusions into our flower beds since it was installed.SamMagnolia, Texas"
4,Works great but it goes off sometimes for no reason,"Works great to keep feral cats off the backyward lawn so it does its job. The only thing I notice is that it does go off for no reason during the day sometimes, wasting water."
1,ineffectual as raccoon deterrent,"I have a major infestation of raccoons in my backyard and purchased this in the hopes of discouraging them. It was not to be. Apparently, they like a nice cold shower as the digging in my lawn was deepest near the Spray Away. I am sure the product works as advertised, it just doesn't help against raccoons."
2,Spray A gay Lotion-Activated Water Repellent,"Now when I think of a scarecrow, I have the image of a hooded man in blue jeans with a dirty shirt with old underpants tied to his head. Not this stupid thing. It's a piece of metal arm that doesn't look like it could frighten a tin man. So right out of the box I wasn't too impressed.I also put Coyote urine in the liquid container instead of water since water doesn't scare thirsty animals away. It's supposed to ""spray off"" anything nearby but it only hit me when I went to check it. I stunk like Coyote urine for about 2 months since Coyote urine doesn't come off unless you douse yourself in cans of tomato juice.After a few months of use, I found my garden pillaged by rodents, beetles, prarie hogs, birds, buzzards, rabbits, mice, lizards and pestilent frogs. Take my advice, build yourself a chicken farm instead."
4,"Spray Away works, but has some drawbacks","The motion activated Spray Away has been helpful in keeping deer out of my flower beds. If you have a large area to protect as I do, the sensor angle is too narrow to protect more than a small area. The battery does not last very long. I leave the system on during the day, but turn the water off. Even so, I've had to replace the battery in about a month of usage. The range is decent, about 25 feet max. Overall, the product is worth it to keep the deer from destroying nearly every living green thing in your yard or garden."
1,A poorly designed version of the ScareCrow,"I've used both - the Havahart sprinkler and the Contech ScareCrow. This version is a clunky, less reliable version of the ScareCrow."
4,Excellent Product,"This product is pretty good in that it can be set to different sensitivity. It does keep all types of animals out of my garden without harm to them - which I particularly like.The only problem I have come across is that the top of the nozzle gets loose and starts too drip water. Tightening needs to be done often to ensure there is no wasted water.Otherwise, awesome product."
3,It works until.....,The animals figure it out...plus the battery doesn't last long. They should make an ac adapter for it and a battery for back up.
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"I purchased this to deter cats, so far I have gotten the mailman and UPS driver, it will not sense a small animal, you cannot lower it less than the stake or angle it down or it will not work at all.If you want to get people or cows then this is for you."
3,keeps dogs away,This is just the neatest thing. The dogs get close and then they get wet so now they keep their distance and that keeps the yard looking real good.
4,Worked but a few hints,"Worked as advertised and was effective in riding our backyard of rabbits. Two hints. The directions for adjusting coverage are on the BOX, not in the instructions so make sure you save the box. I turned the hose faucet up when first installing and adjusting the unit, but the pressure when it was activated was so strong it physically moved the unit back and to the side. I kept moving it back and finally realized I could turn the hose pressure down quite a bit and it stopped moving significantly. The noise and motion were enough to discourage rabbits, I really didn't need to project a very long spray."
3,"A Must See Beautiful Movie,","A wonderful tag line, a beautiful crew and a re-owned director - well the combination should have worked but it fails to do so. The story is very new to Hindi cinema although you tend to feel seeing glimpses from Titanic in the beginning. All mistakes that a director can make is been made in this movie. Even Vivekoberoi fails to shine in what i call a mess of a screenplay. Isha Sharvani - should have been in circus, apart from her dangling from ropes shes ""made"" to do nothing in the movie. A sweet surprise is Antonia Bernath, shes a natural actor-too bad KISNA turned out to be her debut in Indian Cinema.A word on the stunts and action,I feel Indian cinema lacks a good stunt co-coordinator, the film makes a mockery of tense action scenes. in what is supposed to be a edge of seat experience it makes us to laugh at its silliness. perhaps we need to import stunt so-coordinators from holly hood instead of just heroins.well to sum it up, The film is average"
5,Very nice,"This book will be a birthday gift to my niece who was born in 1962, the year this book details. Good condition"
3,"Good, but do not expect so many ""secrets"".","Good book, and it is worth for those who will begin in close-up photography. Simple equipment needed, information about more sophisticated techniques. Some shots are really great, but some are not that thrill. Lou Jabobs Jr. has written lots of photography books and has an awesome background... I don't think he put all his potential on this book."
4,Redeam me; the bible,The music is very soothing and relaxing. I do believe that this is going to be a hot seller once the public get a sample of the originality that it brings to music.
5,Great science fiction adventure stories,"Gardner Dozois collected a bunch of science fiction adventure stories about exploration, ranging from classic stories from the golden age of science fiction to modern stories from the most recent pages of Asimov's science fiction. I loved it."
3,not for a serious costume,These would be fine if you are trying to be over the top and funny but not if you want a serious looking period costume. They are too huge and bushy.
1,Yucky,"These look good from far away. Close up, they look like a mass of trimmed pubic hair. They shed those little hairs, too. Kinda gross."
3,They should have ducked as well as dodged,"A few scattered thoughts while watching this movie again: Alan Hale easily stole it from the bigger stars, Errol Flynn & Olivia de Havilland. The barroom brawl alone makes this a must see (that it's next door to a temperance gathering, hysterical). Victor Jory has to be the quintessential henchman worthy of a hiss or two. Great cinematography. Loads of action.On the down side, Errol Flynn wasn't really the best choice, most of the killings took place off screen yet they showed the death of a little boy in detail (that's always bothered me), and on occassion the color print was out of register making for some fuzzy scenes. Other than that, not bad. I didn't, however, keep it for my DVD collection."
3,Enjoyable but not quite a classic,"Dodge City doesn't hold up as well as other Errol Flynn classics, partially because the film seems to be trying a little too hard to throw everything into the mix, with the through line of the story suffering as a consequence. In many ways it's really just a B-movie with A-movie production values, glorious Technicolor (albeit somewhat inconsistent in the new DVD due to the mastering problems with the old three-strip system elements) and a great supporting cast, and never quite catches fire the way it should despite being more than entertaining enough.Still, the DVD does include among its plentiful extras the superb Tex Avery cartoon The Shooting of Dan McFoo, so I didn't feel shortchanged. Also included is the original trailer built around colour footage of the film's Dodge City premiere, a retrospective featurette 'Go West, Errol Flynn,' short historical drama 'Sons of Liberty,' brief newsreel extract and a trailer for Jimmy Cagney Western The Oklahoma Kid."
3,Rootin Tootin,"Errol Flynn didn't want to be a Western hero, but this Technicolored super-epic made him one anyway -- ""the rich man's Roy Rogers,"" as he put it. The dud script plods from one cliche to another (it's very depressing after the superb scripts of Flynn films like ""Captain Blood,"" ""Robin Hood"" and ""They Died With Their Boots On""), but the attractive cast and professional direction keep it moving painlessly. It's best watched on a big screen, where the exhilarating color photography of trains crossing the prairie, and the train-on-fire climax, have their maximum impact."
2,Wrong genre for Flynn,"One or two good scenes, but this, frankly, isn't much of a movie. Most of the reviewers seem to know this, but they give it high stars because of Flynn and De Havilland. It's all a bit tedious and predictable. Flynn never had an Australian accent (well, maybe, right at the beginning of his career). In fact his accent was about as British as they come, and he wasn't a good mimic when it came to accents. My disc came in the six disc Signature Collection, and although Captain Blood played well, this Dodge City disc had something seriously wrong with both the colour and the sound. A dull script, plot full of silly holes, corny dialogue, heavy-handed comedy can't be saved by the stars and a good barroom brawl. According to the bio-documentary of Errol Flynn, which comes with the collection, the villain in this picture, Cabot, actually managed to ruin Flynn towards the end of his life by suing him, when Flynn had tried to give him a helping hand. My advice is to dodge Dodge City."
4,Solid Western,"There are no gray areas in ""Dodge City"". We know who the good guys and the bad guys are. We know who will prevail in the end. Under the guidance of master director Michael Curtiz the film transcends it's oater roots and makes it seem so much more. The film is also given a gorgeous Technicolor sheen and jaw-dropping production values. Errol Flynn is solid as the upright lawman who is compelled to clean up Dodge City. Alan Hale provides his usual solid comic relief as Flynn's sidekick. Bruce Cabot and Victor Jory are effective as the heavies. About the only gripe I have is that both Ann Sheridan and Olivia de Havilland seem wasted here as a dancehall girl and Flynn's love interest, respectively."
4,Errol Flynn - In His First Western,"Errol Flynn and Olivia de Haviland together -- this time in a western. Westerns were not Errol's favorite genre. The chemistry between the two stars is great, though the story is not as strong as some of his other movies. It is the smaller characters like Alan Hale that make this movie. An interesting tidbit is that the group ""Pure Prairie League"" got its name from a scene in this movie; see if you can figure out from where. Again, a fun movie for everyone."
3,Mediocre Smell.,"I am disappointed that this $8 bar of soap smells no better than any other green soap, and not as good as Irish Spring. I was and am looking for manly smelling soaps that are distinctive, not general in fragrance. I think it is regular overpriced soap. Yes it may last longer but that's only half of what I am looking for. I am currently waiting on a Caswell-Massey sampler and a bar of Mistral Sandalwood... I hope they live up to their pricing."
5,the best soap i own,ANY and EVERY man should try a soap made by the same family for nearly a century. Only something great can last THAT long.
2,Misses the mark,"A Protestant look at Matthew 16 shows that they, and Catholics alike miss the point.As a Protestant, he seeks to quote from Church Fathers to prove a point when his very church rejects 'tradition' - which is what the Church Fathers make part ofCatholics too, in rejecting this book miss the point, for no matter whether Peter was 'the rock', or not, it's not the same thing as saying he was the ONLY rock, as the Church Fathers attest that the Apostles, all were the foundation of the church."
3,Nu 2 U,"A lover of mine pulled my coat about this one. And while Wanda Robinson may be as new to you as she was to me, I've been knowing her as Laini Mataka for years. I've read most her poetry published by Black Classic Press outta Baltimore, MD since the 90s.So when I heard that she had recorded some albums in the 70s I immediately ordered. Glad I did. Beautiful words with lovely music. I ain't no music critic or even grammatically correct, but this is one of those rare finds you just have tell everyone about. So snatch this one up - now. While you have the cash, before you forget.And if you have some more cash laying around, grab up Arthur Prysock's classic * This is My Beloved* and put these two on the CD player in tandem, turn on the red light, put some fire to a Kush incense, light some candles, then lay down with - well - whomever... just make sure you have some condoms and KY handy. Then if you have the energy, sit back and listen to Wanda's words real close and just enjoy her flow..."
5,LOVE REDISCOVERED,THIS CD IS A PERFECT BLEND OF JAZZ/LOVE. IF YOU LOVE EITHER OF THE TWO THIS SHOULD BE IN YOUR COLLECTION. LOVE IS WAITING.
3,Egg Side Walk Chalk,Hard for hands to hold without scrapping hands on concrete. Chalk did not last long.
3,I Had This As A Young Teenager............,"Like all other Barbie Dolls not much can be done with them. The small pieces are often difficult to work, and may break if over forced.I desired it for the purpose of stilling enjoying Macdonald's, without eating their foods, due to an unknown metabolic disorder.My great grandmother loved the franchise, so when I would go, I'd bring this cute little toy, as support!"
1,Junk,This product is junk. I purchased two of them and three days later one of them were broken already and the pictures are horrible! They have no flash and need direct sunlight and even then good luck getting a good picture. We are yet to get one. Save your money!
1,Poor excuse for a camera,"We purchased the camera and my daughter was quickly very disappointed. The pictures were very dark. You needed a lot of light for them to come out. Also, the batteries died quickly. It uses battery energy to maintain the pics so you want to remove the pics as soon as possible.The one bright spot is the picture editor software. It was fun to use and provide some good Disney additions."
1,Piece of crap,I wish I could pick negative stars. I bought this for my daughter's birthday and I can't get the pics off this thing onto the computer. Then when I try to delete them off the camera it's a whole nother hassle.Seriously spend the extra money and get a different cheapy camera.
1,it looks like a tic tac container!,"This camera greatly under-performed from my expectations. The picture quality is not very good. I figured it would not be the same size as a normal camera, the picture that shows the camera in the advertisement is extremely misleading. When it showed up at my doorstep and I realized it was the size of a tic tac box I laughed! I would never buy this product again-- Very disappointed!"
4,"Not sure about the program, but the picture editor is worth it!","I actually have not tested the camera yet. I have installed the picture program and started playing with the features. If you don't think the camera is worth the money, the program is. You can add Disney characters to photos, add text, and there are other options, such as drawing and erasing. I just opened up photos that I took with a real digital camera and edited those.I really don't think you're paying for the camera, I think you're paying for the program.I would recommend this product if you want Disney characters in your photos."
1,Clearly I am being punished for buying Chinese products,"Purchased as a toy for a toy price level of $10.59 including tax. Therefore, the fact that the pictures were extremely blurry was not an issue. However, this camera only worked the first couple of times my daughter used it. Now the download message consistently reports that there are no pictures in camera. A digital camera that either won't store a picture or won't send the picture to the computer is good for nothing but the landfill.Typical China junk (poor quality, poorly designed, produced solely to turn a quick buck). This one will head to the dump to join the ""bargain"" $40 dollar (at 60% off) Chinese junk camcorder that I picked up for her brother.Don't buy for the software either. The editing software will not recognize anything but this camera so don't buy this thinking you can edit and decorate pictures from another camera when you discover that your new piece of Chinese junk doesn't work. That won't be an option."
1,Should have returned it,"This did not work...at all! I should have returned it, but I bought it as a gift for my 4yr old, and we didn't find that it didn't work until we gave it to her and she loved it. She still ""pretends"" that it works and it is the perfect size for small hands, but ours may have been defective because it just did not work at all"
2,Not great,My 7 yr old didn't like it because it does not display the pic. Buy one that you can see the picture right after you take it on the camera.
5,This Is A MUST HAVE!,"To anyone who is remotely aware of stanley clarke or is a bass lover, this is a must have cd! there is no way to describe what a phenominal bass virtuoso stanley clark is, he is truly one of the greats to go down in music history.And check out the fantastic guitar work by John Mclaughlin on Song to John, part two sounds very similiar to Big Al Dimeola, this cd shreds and then mystifies"
5,All Good,"Not one bad cut. The great thing about this album is you can take each of the musicians singly and explore what they are doing. Listen to Jeff Beck...not on ""Hello Jeff"" (actually DO listen to that too!) but on ""Journey to Love"". His haunting solo fits perfectly with the mood of the song...and gives it the Beck Edge. George Duke glides throughout. David Sanctious (sp?) is a monster...not just on keyboard but guitar as well. From Stanley's original ""Stanley Clarke"" through this album and then to ""School Days"" this three album era was Stanley stepping out and rippin it up."
4,Good listen and learn,"I really enjoy listening to the Bible as it is read. The voices take on characters, so it's easier to follow and understand than reading alone. This helps to keep the subject matter in mind as you follow along. It's great for long road trips as I listen time passes and I am getting more and more familiar with God's word!"
1,installation nightmare,"I received this in the mail yesterday and was very excited. It arrived quickly and in good condition. I am computer literate and hardly ever have any trouble installing anything on my computer, but this has been very difficult.I have already spent 6 hours, over two days, and still have not even found the New Testament anywhere on my MP3, all I ever get is the Old Testament.I am very disappointed with the installation directions. There seems to be no directions on uninstalling(so I can try to install again).Other than this problem, the OT I have listened to looks good and the audio is also good.I finally figured out how to install and listen to the Bible and realize it is not a bad value but just needs better installation instructions."
2,ice cubes,I was dissapointed when I opened the box and found out that the filter did nothave the screw in connectors and attachment fittings!
4,cheaper than the alternative,"I have a refrigerator that has a built-in water filter. I also have a filter (this one) between my water line and the water intake on the back of the fridge. The filter inside the fridge costs approx. $50 to replace, this one is about 20% of that and my water and ice are just fine."
3,Somewhat satisfied.,I gave this to my 15 yr old daughter on Dec 25. When she went to put it on the ball would not screw back on.I contacted the seller and they were happy to send a new one with no cost. for this reason i will not change my Star rating.I bought this for a Christmas gift for my teenage daughter.The Picture is not correct.The top small bead is solid silver NO gem in it what so ever.The bottom larger stone is true to the picture. For this reason I give it 3 stars.
5,Things start to heat up!,In these four episodes you now find out more about the Ex-Cons and how Dohji is involved. A new character is also introduced in the series as things start to heat up as you learn more about Masane and the Witchblade. The destiny of the Witchblade continues...
3,Good book for a teen!,"Doesn't list yarn sizes but has good basic instructions with excellent pics. Written towards the teen set. A few great patterns, if you aren't plus size. Patterns: beret, cloche and russian hats; mittens, 4 scarves, 5 bags, a purse on a belt, 2 more belts, 3 chokers and a wrist cuff, weird fingerless gloves that aren't really fingerless gloves, leg warmers, a cute mini skirt, a shawl, a poncho, a halter and a bikini. This book is worth it for the beaded evening bag, mini skirt and bikini! :)"
4,rileys gammy,"If you crochet...you'll like this book especially for young women or teenagers and those who like fashion. Great for beginners as well as novice crocheters. very cute adorable projects. Fashionable updated ideas and projects also. scarves, purses, hats even a bathing suit!complete detail and step by step instructions included!"
1,Unfamiliarized,I have went for the past 6 years to H & R Block to have my taxes done and now it's time to learn something for myself.
3,family dvd ?,"great,as described condition, vendor at no fault here but this movie was lame and very drawn out."
1,Too Bad Amazon Doesn't Have Zero Stars,"For any family that holds to any kind of traditional moral standard, this movie is deplorable. Maybe if one thinks lying is 'cutsie' it might be comical. But, I find nothing amusing about a whole movie premised on a knowing lie. Then, to bring a young girl into lying as well, it becomes even more abominable. Finally, to see that everything becomes 'okay' because the boss is known to lie as well, we reached the straw that breaks the camel's back. So, if you have any desire to instill truthfulness in your kids, stay away from this movie. Lying causes too much damage to make light of it."
5,Best self-help book on cancer!,A friend of mine recommended this book because a family member is going through cancer. Wow--it's packed with helpful information for caregivers and for family members on what to say and do. I only wish I had this book in my hands three weeks ago. I found the chapter on anger most helpful--I guess that's where I am right now--asking why?
5,Inspirational reading for breast cancer survivors,"As someone who works with breast cancer patients on a daily basis, I'm thrilled this little book with a big message is here: There is life after breast cancer. A patient of mine going through treatment handed me the book and said, ""Make sure each of your patients receives a copy!"" Great advice from a patient."
4,Very good condition,"Would have given five stars, but the dust cover was a bit weathered...but to be expected from such an old book. Very happy with purchase."
2,OCTAMAN--BAD DISK OF A VERY BAD MOVIE!,"OCTAMAN is one of Rick Baker's first films--which, of course, makes it quite interesting. It is not, however, a very good film. Poor writing, bad cinematography, and insipid direction make this a difficult film to watch--and one that often makes no sense.Unfortunately, the disk quality of this release doesn't hep. The picture is dark and, in places, quite grainy. The film is hard enough to follow without adding a print that is tough to see!OCTAMAN is for completists only."
4,Octoman--just what you'd expect,"Lovers of B-movies with rubber-suited monsters will like this, others should be stoned. It's not among the best of the bad movies, so I give it only four stars, but it is miles of rough hiking to the worst of the bad movies."
1,painful,"For being forty years old the film qualty is surprisingly decent, but that is the only quality to speak of here. This movie teeters between painfully boring and just painful. The octaman costume might look good for trick or treating, but in this movie everytime he moves he looks as if he might fall over. All he does in this movie is flip over tables and hug people. The joke wears thin fast. This is for monster movie collectors only."
2,or 4 armed man?,"of the 70's worst film quality i.e. some scenes too dark & effects kinda lousy; it did have some action. the filming was @ an inland bayou & inland high valley w/ no ocean, which made the show more unbelievable."
3,Lots of Noise,"The 4 tracks on this EP release all sound monotonous -- lots of noise and can get kind of irritating. There are some nice drum effects like Alec Empire and Plug's Luke Vibert can muster on most of the tracks, but lots of aural chaos that, to quote my girlfriend, ""sounds like he's torturing children."" My favorite off this EP is Corpses (version), which is more of the same but the best configuration of it, and is the only reason for the 3 stars. Perhaps this EP is only for the initiated. If you're a TEF neophyte, ""You Guys Kill Me"" is your best choice."
1,Not what you think it is,"Be advised that this is not a collection of the original recordings. You can't tell from the Amazon catalog, but all of these songs have been newly recorded by ""the original artists or members of the original groups"". It's not the real stuff, if that's what you are looking for."
4,Very eye catching,"Very nice watch. Mine came with a manual, if yours doesn't, good luck figuring out all of the functions. The face is smaller than I was expecting, the picture makes it look bigger. That really is the only drawback. Well worth the money considering everything it can do, and the look and feel. Great price!"
5,Fine account of the early days of the AFL,"The author has done a great job in covering not only the early days of the under-financed Titans but the rest of the AFL as well. Well written and including interviews with some of the old Titan players and coaches that made it a fun, entertaining and informative reading experience. A highly recommended book for AFL fans as well as football historians."
3,Text Book for College Senior Project Class,"This was the ""required"" text book for my senior-project in college, Business Admin Major. It suited the requirements and was easily understood."
2,No way to synchronize dial and readout,"Installed this water meter for my pond. Works ok (no way to check calibration), but when the dial reads about 7 gal, the digital number hits is on the center of the number, which makes it confusing to read the total. It should have been set at the factory to hit the center of the readout number when the dial hits zero. Example: readout reads 000041 exactly, and the dial reads 6.5. Is it 000416.5 or 000406.5 gal."
4,Had some problems,"At first we thought ours was defective, because it had to be primed (letting water flow through the steam wand) after every brew cycle, and the front knob wasn't working. After using it for a week with these problems, it seemed to fix itself, I guess it just needed to be ""broken in"". But we ended up sending it back anyway, and the reason was that when the grounds emptied into the grounds hopper, it leaked quite a bit of coffee into the drip tray. Well, we found out later that this is something that happens with every automatic espresso machine, and I personally think it's just too irritating, and doubt I'll ever get another automatic espresso machine because of it. If anyone knows of an automatic espresso machine that does not do this, please respond to this review. Other than that, it was a fine machine, and I would recommend to anyone having initial problems with it to use it for at least a week and see if they don't go away."
5,Beautiful,"I bought these for my bridesmaids. My colors were black and green and the color on screen was the exact color they came as. They are large, and very beautiful. It IS a pashmina and not just a scarf! Highly recommended."
5,More than I expected,"I purchased this item to compliment a long sundress I am wearing for my granddaughter's wedding. It is made out of beautiful silky fabric, the color is exactly what I was looking for and perfectly matches my shoes."
1,The day in which trash was awarded,"Probably this is one of the worst books I've ever read. Besides being an overrated bestselles, the novel is full with cliches, misconnections in the plot and a boring and pretentious prose. I hope that Planeta stops giving big money to this excessively commercial junk and start using the money to encourage the good writers of Spanish literature."
4,This book devours you from beginning to end !,Keeps your mind off the every day life by inviting you to explore those little intrigues of the characters who might very well be sitting next to you..even yourself.
5,Buy This CD,"I bought this cd from the bands website a long time ago. I loved it! What was nice was that I got a few personal e-mails from the band! Talk about pleasing the fans. I would love to see these guys live. If you like punk music, you will not be disappointed. I even got some stickers that promote the band with it. Rock On!!!"
4,An interesting idea and well developed overall,"This adventure pits the players against a StarMech warhulk (an automated AI capital ship) left over from the Second Galactic War. The warhulk, having been badly damaged in the war has finally succeeded in repairing itself and is now eager to pick up where it left off. Some interesting ideas and subplots, and the AI personality of the warhulk, Ares 22 (complete with dark humour) is especially well done. Players have to contend with a traitor within their ranks, an assault by a commando team, not to mention a race against time and a Concord fleet massing to blow the warhulk into tiny particles. I just wonder if this adventure was inspired by Edward Bryant's short story 'Pilots of the Twilight'..."
4,Moonphase,"The shipping was fast and the product arrived in perfect condition. I have not watched the entire season yet, but so far it is interesting. It helped that it was on sale or I probably would not have purchased it without watching it first."
5,good series,"If you're a fan of cute anime girls, paranormal activities, or pre-teens with vampiric tendencies, then you will love this series.5/5And, just as a side note, the package arrived exactly as described, so you won't be disappointed by ordering from Amazon as opposed to other sites."
4,Bingo!!! She is Better Than Britney!!!,"She has a BEAUTIFUL voice. Ofcourse, It's not like all her songs are gonna be an instant hit, but some of them are quite likeble!!! She is so not a fake, she only gets ideas from past singers!! I mean, she is no profesional or anything, that the way people make their way through the ladder to suc-sess, they start little, and they slowly get bigger. Her CD is good......for only teenagers, I dont really think that adults are gonna be interested in this CD."
2,I was hoping this CD was a metamorphosis of her voice,"She may have star quality but as an actress and a singer, she is not even as convincing as the Olsen twins (which is pretty bad). I know that the Olsen twins don't sing and since Hilary's basically a Olsen clone, (in her career, not physically) she would do well not to either so that her 10 year old fans would not be disappointed by hearing their little Lizzie McGuire ""hero"" sound like nails on a chalkboard. Why do we not turn our attention to the more noteworthy young talents of today such as Lindsay Lohan or Alexis Bendel?"
1,Dissapointed,"I thougth this CD would be very good, and different.....but it's just like any other pop CD.....it's boring, and it seems Hilary voice is computer generated....There is only on good track on this CD and that is track #2....."
1,Disgrace too bubble commerical pop music,I really regret ever buying this horrible cd. It's a complete wasit. This girl Hilary has absolutely no voical talent. If you listen very carefully you can tell how much her voice was computerized. Now lets forget abou the lack of vocial talent on this cd and focus on the songs. The Matrix the producers she worked with are as bad as hilary. No writing skills and she sings about the STUPIDEST things in this world. Not only that but Hilary wrote ZERO songs on this album. But Heyy if you're into a computerized commerical wannabe music then this is the cd for you.
1,I'm TIRED of Hilary!!!,"Hilary Duff (or should I say Hilary Duffelbag, as one kid said on here, hahahahahah) we are TIRED of you! You're not as cool as you think you are! You can't sing, your voice keeps cracking and getting out of key! Your acting plain out SUCKS, because you make yourself look simple on TV. GO TO FREAKIN COLLEGE TO BECOME SOMETHING GAY LIKE A PROFESSIONAL CARPETENTER OR FLORIST OR SOMETHING! BUT QUIT SHOVING YOUR UN-TALENTLNESS DOWN OUR THRAOTS! Gosh, Hilary! Dissing you never felt so good!!!"
1,It is annoying,"The first time I heard it, I thought it was okay. I could stand it.After ahile it seemed like her songs began to get over played on the radio stations. That really gets to me, therefore I got annoyed and think she has a bad voice. Its just annoying and obnoxious. Like high pitched. So I think this CD isn't the best out there."
3,This CD is ALRIGHT...,"What do I have to say? This superstar of a girl has made it to the top. She is a big trend-center for tweens, and also for aspiring actors/actresses...but needless to say, she isnt very good in singing.I do occasionally watch the ever so popular show ""Lizzie McGuire"", and like her as an actress (more like a clutz). She sang really nicely though in the ""LIZZE McGUIRE MOVIE"".If you are a top of the 'hil' hilary duff fan, *cough*, you must own this. But if you just occasionally watch, don't even think about getting it.If you do like the show, and like the other singer, LALAINE, go to her site at... www.lalaine.net and order her CD. I did, and its worth 5 stars. Defenitely."
2,"This CD is So Yesterday, So Not Tomorrow, and So Not EVER!","I'm only giving this CD two stars because I used to like Hilary Duff, as innocent Lizzie McGuire. Then Disney had to go make the movie, which was pretty good itself, but as a result Hilary Duff rises suddenly as this diva star or something! What's up with that? She's only famous because of the movie. Hilary, I love you as Lizzie McGuire but you are a HORRIBLE singer! It's not even her real voice. They've done same major editing so she sounds better than she really is."
1,Hilary Duff please stick to acting. Please,"Her record contract should have gone to someone who earned it.She can't sing well, and she has no stage presence. I mean Britney Spears voice is terribe, but she more than make up for it with her dances, and stage pressence.Hilary doesn't even sing live, and she doesn't even write her own lyrics.Why don't all the actor come out with albums, because they will make million even if they don't have talent. Hilary duff is living proof."
1,"Hilary, Hilary...","Just when you think you've seen the worse of it all, along comes Hilary Duff. Now I normally wouldn't care for talentless people but Hilary really pushed the limits of talentlessness this time. Making this album was wayyyyy over the edge. She's just begging to be slapped. This is ridiculous."
1,PLEASE MAKE HER STOP!!!!,Hilary's irritating voice and her meaningless lyrics basically ruined the CD.
5,so...,"i don't know why, but I Love this girl, and her music. It's average pop, but.... it's excellent!!! The best songs are ""So yesterday"", ""Come clean"", ""Party up"", and ""Little voice"""
4,Hilary: not bad huh!!,"Well first of all let me tell you a little of why I started to like Hilary Duff, to tell you the truth it was last week when I discovered that Hilary is not that bad she actually rocks!!. First I knew her because of the Disney Channel series ""Lizzie Mcguire"" but I never saw it so in my mind I made the idea of ""I hate Hilary Duff"" but it was just beacuse I never gave her the chance so until my sister told me, ""Claudia just listen to her!!"" and she bought the cd and put in the car and I was really really surprised that Hilary sings awesome is not nothing from other world but her songs are really fun, yestreday I saw her movie (the lizzie mcguire movie) and now I wanna buy it!! now my mind totally changed about her.This experience tells me not to judge before listening to someone beacause now my sister tell me ""didn't you hated her?"" and now I think I like her as much as her.GO HILARY YOUR CD IS GREAT SPECIALLY ""SO YESTERDAY"""
1,metamorphosis? i think not!,"hilary duff has made no metamorphosis on this album!if you like the catchy upbeat melodys of hilary duff i sugest buying music from an performer who can actually sing (i.e. skye sweetnam). however hilary can not.true you do not need a sugnificant voice to make it in the music indistrie or to have integrity as a artist. hilary is no artist!NO AMOUT OF ON STAGE BACK FILPS WILL CHANGE THAT!! ""metamorphosis"" is an album made of tracks that were stolen melodys from every manstream success in the past decade (maybe thats why the sounds so familar, huh kids?). the lyrics are weak, her voice even weaker and there is nothing substantial to the record.DO NOT BUY THIS CD!chances are you willa.) like it in the begining and grow tired of it(so i sugest kazza).b.) realize it is a cheap summery of your previous cd collection.c.) just plain hate it.ord.) you just bought the cd cuz you think hilarys hot and never listen to it anyway."
3,A Good Beginner's Effort,"We'll I think all the little girls and boys should enjoy Hilary Duff's stardum now because, in about 3 years, she just may tear off all her clothes and pull a Britney on us ..."
3,for the devoted only,"As a big fan of Hilary Duff's roles in TV and film as well as her bubbly personality and eligibility to be one of today's best role models, I was not particularly impressed by her singing. While she steals away with catchy beats and innovative music, her CD is a testament to the notion that she is succeeding on the basis of her good looks.Although I didn't think the CD was great as a whole, there were some standout songs -- ""Come Clean"", ""Metamorphosis"" and ""Where Did I Go Right"". But it's the music that carries her voice through the CD, not her talent.All in all, ""Metamorphosis"" is a good buy for a devoted fan, but save your money for a rainy day if you're looking for real talent."
1,Yeah... I'd just like to know what all the hype is about.,"The #1 Reason why I hate this CD.1. Hillary's voice leaves much to be desired. It's is just cruel injustice that Hillary should be the special one that got herself noticed when she started out. And I know this girl Grace who goes to my school who is bold, funny, unique, could captivate the world with her singing voice and leaves the audience with pains in their sides from laughing or with tears streaming down their cheeks at every school drama performance. Now why, I ask you, is Hillary living out the dream of many people just like Grace? Who knows. All I know is that Hillary ruined this album! I don't hate pop music at all, In fact I usually enjoy listening to it a lot. But this album is fake and downright pathetic."
4,From a mom's perspective...,"Ok, I must admit first off, that I actually listen to this CD in the car with my kids and it really doesn't bug me. Even though I am almost 30, I still find some of the songs on this CD catchy (Come Clean and Metamorphasis). I have 2 elementary age boys who are infatuated with her and I honestly didn't mind buying them this one. Her lyrics are clean (yes, they are very ""preteen"" lyrics...but who needs her to rush and grow up anytime soon?) and I know I can safetly let my kids listen to it and enjoy it without cursing and sexual undertones. For parents...this is a great choice!"
3,Try again,"This album is quite enjoyable, but of course it has its low points..which are forgivable for now...since this Hilary's first album. Here's my analysis of Metamoprhosis.PRO'S- SO YESTERDAY and THE MATH are cleverly written songs that really suit Hilary's tween queen persona, and these songs maximize Hilary's vocal capabilities.- COME CLEAN shows a darker side of Hilary...and you can really notice her effort in singing this song.- anywhere but here, love just is, working it out doesnt hurt the ear..radio friendly songs that you could find yourself singing along to.CONS- Sweet Sixteen, Little Voice flamboyantly shows tween persona which is sickening at times- Party up sounds like a smash mouth rip off- The title track sounds as if it was produced in 10 minutes- INNER STRENGTH is such a waste...you dont really get the point of this interlude on which hilary speaks about being strong, a girl power type of interlude- tracks sounds the same!!!Hil i hope you do better on your next album"
1,hilary has a posse,"what a funny little grudge match.to think hilary fluff is considered good enough to have to defend.whats next,a tug of war over whos the best smurf?!?!?!?!?that should be a heated battle!"
4,Pretty Good,"This album was actually ok, shes not a good singer or a bad one. Shes okay, the songs on the album are pretty good.So Yesterday- 6/10 Just becuz I'm tired of hearing it.Come Clean- 9/10 One of my favorite songs.Workin it Out- 6/10 Has a nice beat but I don't like the chorusLittle Voice- 4/10 Very weird song.Where Did I Go Right- 8/10 Good.Anywhere But Here- 6/10 Good song for her voice.The Math-2/10 I don't like it.Love Just Is-5/10 Some parts of the song are good.Party Up -6/10 Okay song but I don't it makes sense.Metamorphosis- 7/10 GoodInner Strengh- 5/10 Very short but sends a message.Why Not-3/10 You have heard it before, I have too and I'm SICK of it!"
5,this cd is the best,"HIlary Duff is an awesome singer. Her voice is beautiful. I bought the cd the day it went on sale! i wolud deffinetly reccommend it to people to buy. this cd rocks and so does Hilay!I luv ya Hilary, keep singing!!XOXONatile Greenway"
1,Hillary Duff cant sing for beans,"i always say acting and music dont mix and i'm right. hillary duff cant sing. she is a spoiled bad actor(and remeber i said actor). Her voice is edited an unbelievable amount and if you've ever heard her live she really sucks if she even sings. most of the time she lip syncs anyway. she shouldnt be on MTV and i cant understand why she is on the radio. and worst of all, her music(if you can even call it music) is pop. Parents, please dont allow your little girls to listen to this trash. turn them on to a better sound like punk or heavy metal. get a life hillary duff!"
1,I'm I staright guy with a girlfriend and I can sing 10 times,higher and better than Hilary Duff. That should tell you something.
5,evanescence badness,"Hillary Duff is AWESOME. she can sing, but lets see she can act too. OK, so shes not the ""perfect"" singer as you all classified her, but so what? I've heard all the songs to this CD and its all pretty good. When you listen to it you feel like a teen (most teens are listening to this) and its liek you can hum along ith it, without sounding bad. And its not negative. Like Evanescence. Its not making teens feel depresed like Amy Lee's lyrics and her voice that is ""oh so sad"" I pick Hilary Duff over Evanescence by a long shot. And one reviewer sad bad things about Christina Aguilera? Christina rocks ok? Shes like Hilary - she sings as her profession and wants to get into acting but hilary cts as her profession and does some singing. This CD definetly rocks (So Yesterday and The Math are really cool songs) Buy this CD, lsiten, when your bored or with friends. Its nice ;)"
3,It's Ok...,"Ok, I really like the show Lizzie McGuire and the movie following it, but I must agree with the people saying she can't really sing. I mean, it's not like, terrible, but it's not great. I think that if you liked Hilary Duff as an actress you'd probably want to check out the CD, but if you didn't like her to begin with don't buy it."
1,What a terrible voice!,"She's can't sing at all! Please don't buy her albums, please!!!!I would rate this album zero star if I could. This album is just gabbage!"
4,O.K.,"Alright, first I'll have to admit: Hilary Duff does not have the best singing voice. But this CD has some easier songs, so it makes the CD more enjoyable. If you can accept any Britney Spears album, you'll most likely accept Metamorphosis. It's got loads of little catchy tunes that you really can't get sick of. My personal favorites are So Yesterday and Come Clean, mainly because they're not as teeny bopper-ish as you'd think. They're on a more mature rate that I Can't Wait and Why Not. I rated it 4 stars because I'm really trying to give her as much credit as possible. I really don't think she should've gone into the music business, but you can tell she really enjoys it in this album, and heart is everything in singing. Hopefully, her vocal coach can get her to sing more challenging songs in the future, but I'll accept the A-Teens/Britney clone for now."
5,wow!!,wow!!! i was very supprised by how well this album turned outA++++ i can't stop listening to it!! definetly a must have cd.
5,Good or Bad that is the Question!,"Well, I absolutly loved the cd. She has a beautiful voice. She is definetly going places. Although I still think she is a better actress but she needs to do what she wants! Well if you liked her songs ""Why Not"" ""I Can't Wait"" and ""So Yesterday"" you will definetly love this cd! So I give it 5 stars and I so that this is a GOOD cd!!"
4,Metamorphosis hasn't improved Hilary Duff's voice,"Hilary Duff's ""Metamorphosis"" is a decent debut (excluding her 2002 holiday recording).Ms. Duff has made sure that her album is diverse. She experiments with other genres besides pop. In fact, the best tracks are rock. The album really falters when it comes to ballads. The lyrics are mediocre, and Duff's voice can't handle the emotion needed for such songs.Most of the songs are great. Frankly, I did not expect the young actress to be able to make an adequate album. Her voice holds up. Yet it could do so much more! She has no vibrato whatsoever, and she lacks strength. Let's hope that next time, Ms. Duff takes more time to work on her voice before heading to the studio."
4,Go Hilary!,"wow! Hilary Duff did an amazing job with her first album! Some places she does struggle a bit, but overall she is great. This is a good cd for people who like Hilary Duff and like pop. The pictures are pretty good. Plus, this cd gives you all the words to the lyrics. Hilary really has done a vast metamorphosis to accomplish this album. Although, people saw that she's the next Britney, I disagree. Britney Spears has more of a talent for music, but Hil is trying. This is a AMAZING album! WAY TO GO HILARY!"
5,Another Success For Hilary Duff,"Awesome CD, long awaited and worth it!!!!! Metamorphosis combines inspirational songs with party songs and just plain feel good jams. Great production and lyrics including some writen by Hilary herself and even Haylie her sister. Is there anything she can't do????? If you havn't picked up this one yet, your missing out, in fact buy 2, it's that good. Disc contains a song for every type of person. Guaranteed to please, as expected."
1,God help us all,"Jesus christ, what is this world coming to? It's like minature britney has come out. Yet another pop tart jumping onto the wagon, following the latest trend (a back a band, no voice - just looks, a skateboard in her video). I wish this girl would just make up her mind. One minute she's britney, the next she's following the avril trend.So yeah, if you follow whatever anyone tells you is ""hip and cool"", and if you like pretty blonde girls that sing about boys and crushes, this album is for you.But if you have anysense what-so-ever, don't bother."
5,A pretty good debut!,"I didn't really think that this CD would be good but there wasn't much else to buy and it was only $10. I am very happy with the purchase. There is not one song I dislike. They all sound good with a lot of soon to be hits like ""Come Clean"", ""Little Voice"", ""Where did I go right"" and ""The Math"" this CD is going to be hot for a while. It is now #1 on Billboard in its second week of release. I am shocked! Hilary has a bigger fan base than I expected."
1,Hillary Duff is So Yesterday,"I'm sorry but she's a total fake... You never hear about her than all of the sudden she's everywhere you turn. Like another persons menchained earlier, her mother, Susan Duff is a producer and is probably how she got in the music business in the first place. Her voice is horrid, her sister wrote most of her songs, her ""silver screen"" acting is cheap and over-rated...it seems like she and Lindsay Lohan are at war with whose the better singer and actor...Lindsay Lohan is a fake singer, too but a much better actress. I espicially dislike how Hilary always seems to have the same role in EVERY single movie. She's always the goodie goodie girl and hasn't played much of anything else. Whats the beauty to good acting she may ask? It's the ability to play different characters who come from different places, not the same goody goody girl who we should feel sorry for."
3,"Over 15 years of age, DO NOT BUY!!!","Well, I'm 25 and into all types of music. I love Hilary Duff because she's gorgeous and a great actress with a great sense of fashion. But I'm afraid to say that this CD was just average to me. I was quite disappointed and I don't think I'll ever listen to it again. I only liked about four songs out of all of them. But to be fair, like I said, I'm 25, and I'm more likely to like Avril Lavegne pop vs. Hilary Duff pop. Taking into account that she's only 15, it's an ok album and hopefully she matures in her music as she gets older. But for anyone over 15, this wouldn't be one I'd recommend. It seems like something you'd play at a junior high slumber party."
1,Can't Sing:A review about singing.,"This girl cannot sing, okay.This is her fake voice.I heard she sounds terrible at live.I mean come on people open your eyes.This girl cannot sing at all.She dosen't have the skills.Don't you know when Christina Aguilera was 16 she had a voice like a 20-year old.The only people I know who like her are billions of immature 10-12 year olds.Like every day someone buys a copy of her album.People who cannot sing have a job like selling wedding dresses and they're trying to a get a simple $1,000 in a month and Hilary Duff gets a million dollars in 2 months when she dosen't know how to sing.Uhh, these days are going absultly nuts.Please tell me the future's music will be good."
1,OH..................... AWFUL,THIS CD IS THE WORSE I EVER HAVE>...her voice sounds so fake...................i dont recommend this at all
2,"Hilary, Oh Hilary","I'm really sorry Hilary,but besides Come Clean, your songs are terrible. You seem like a nice girl and you have an okay voice but you weren't cut out for this. Sorry to say, except for the Lizzie McGuire show, your acting stinks too. If I were you I'd give up quietly."
1,I Hate Hilary Duff,"I wish I could rate it 0!Please don't even think of buying this cd! I didn't buy it for a reason, and that being the she sucks!!!!She does! Why am I hear? To give my opinion. That's why!Seriously, she already f***ing acts, why the f*** does she need to sing when she clearly can't! Even Amazon gave it a bad review, what does that tell you? I'm just saying that all these stupid lil girls that think they can sing NEED 2 DIE.Yes Hilary, Britney, Girl Groups, and YES The Olsen Twins, NEED 2 DIE!!!! U SUCK!"
1,Must have for 4 year olds,"Wow! Finally the perfect CD for 4 year olds! This is the best thing for little kids since Barney, the purple dinosour. Packed with simple kiddy lyrics, this CD is sure to keep every preteen singing along for hours."
3,Decent,"Duff is a decent actress and is very cute, but her voice isn't too good. The album is mostly flooded with corny tracks like ""Sweet Sixteen"" & ""The Math"" but their are also stand out tracks such as ""So Yesterday"" & ""Come Clean"" which are both fantastic songs. Buy at your own risk."
1,Dilary Huff,"Did anyone else just think to themselves gimmick? Definitely she is just some tool marketed beyond belief to all kids. But musical talent, something she lacks. She can't sing, the songs are overly done stereotypical pop star songs, and she had nothing to do with the writing of anything on this album. So if you need to even consider buying this or need to read a review to decide whether or not to buy this you might as well just buy it because you dont know any better and you are the people that these companies make there large amounts of money from."
1,Just read the rest of these reviews,"If you take the time to read the reviews on here, it quickly becomes obvious that the only people who like this CD are girls in their early teens. I'll leave it at that."
2,"There ""might"" be a bright side to this CD","First of all, im not 12. I dont feel like having my mailbox bombed with ads from this site so I didnt sign up.Well, this CD wasn't good for listening but it made decent coaster. Its also great for target practice with my 12 guage. Hang that baby up and blast it.Oh yea, I made a project out of the cover by melting the plastic with a blowtorch. My friends liked it and we had a good time burning it and running it over with our cars so ill give it 2 stars instead of 1."
4,Pretty GOOD!!!,this CD is a very good example of the talent that Hilary has. the way she sings it is amazing. You would have never expected it. You can truly realte to most of her songs.
2,"love her, not her singing","i really really love hilary duff, i really do, i am a really big fan, but i have got to admit that she shouldn't sing, because she cant really, she should stick to acting."
1,"ONE SONG is GREAT, others are SO-SO","I hate to be harsh...but, So Yesterday is wonderful, buy the rest of the songs are just so so. The album just is not good enough. They should have spent more time on this album."
1,Beyonce is way way way way way WWWWAAAAYYY better than hilar,Beyonce Know is ten times better than hilary
1,lol maybe it's a really long joke,"this CD is a joke. period. not only is her voice bad, but her music is bad too.When I heard ""Come Clean"" I thought, ""Hey look! Alvin and the Chipmunks!"" and then ""Hey Look! William Hung's daughter!""I hate Britney, but God she's is 200% better than duff. And christina is 300% better than duff.i hope she shuts up."
1,I hate it...but this is about YOU,"if you have read any of my other reviews you know they are all about YOU. Well, i hate this CD. my friend has it and makes me listen to it all the time. she gets REALLY REALLY annoying. well, i guess if you like Jessica Simpson, Britney Spears, or any other wannabe pop star you would like her. but, this is not real music. try the beatles, good charlotte, simple plan. well, she pretty much has no instrumentals so they can't be bad...i think it's worse without them. she is aimed towards shallow guys. it's a given. if you are one, or some wannabe girl, i'm sure you'll find a use for this."
2,Duff Doesn't Quite Have The Stuff,"I completely agree with the professional review of this CD. She means well, but this CD is just very childish. She can't sing nearly as well as she can act. She may be cute, but her vocals and her lyrics (""if you can't do the math, get out of the equation, I'm calling you back, this is *69) just don't cut it. I'd be willing to give her another try in a couple more years, but it's going to take her a lot of work if she wants to overcome all the mistakes she made on ""Metamorphosis."""
1,She can't sing. At all. Period. End of sentence.,"She can't sing. Her songs aren't bad. But she cannot sing at all. She's yet another J.Lo, i.e. a not half bad actress that has the misguided notion that she also has a singing voice. It's weak, puny and boring. I can't believe anyone would actually buy this album. My kid sister has it (that's how I came to hear some of it and be able to feel fit to write a review) and wow, I love her, but I think she's crazy to support such an untalented hack. Normally I have lot of respect for other people's musical taste, but just, wow. This is an incredibly cheap work of fluff. If you buy it, you are buying into the notion that looks and ""cute"" are more important than musical talent."
1,Another actress cashing in on Britney terrority......,"She can sing only a little bit and has the stage presence of any other teeny bopper..They're all the same!! I guess she was break from acting roles to put out this mediocre cds,which sounds like bad leftovers from Mandy Moore...Go back to acting and learn a lesson from the other actors like William Shatner,Cheryl Ladd and so on that have attempted this....Girls:Ask more from these singers and don't keep falling for the same old song and dance.Have you girls ever noticed that all of them have the same act,the same dance moves,the same videos and image??? You guys deserve much better than this!!!"
1,who buys this manufactured rubbish?,"I think hilary should stick to acting, this cd is the worst i have heard for a long time!!!"
4,I got this 1 when I was younger...,"Let me start off to say that Hilary Duff is a much better actress than a singer. Don't get me wrong here, she's totally awesome, but maybe she should have stuck to movies instead of getting into the music side of stuff. I think she is really talented, and am a huge fan of her's, but maybe singing isn't her thing. I did, though, like this CD. Some songs are very good. It is most definately pop! Oh well, she can sing if she wants too. Not a bad CD, better than her second one..."
4,I am a 22 year old heterosexual male and I like this album,"First off, Someone previously said that you shouldn't buy this album just because everyone else is listening to it. Then went on to say its only reasonable for 12 year old girls to be listening to this and made fun of everyone else for buying it.Clearly within the college community I am not following everyone else. If anything its trendy to make fun of those who do listen to Hilary Duff. I am a minority.I am usually not into pop music. I didn't like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, or most pop music when I was in high school. And currently I dislike Ashley Simpson with a passion. But I feel like this album is different. It has catchy tunes that stand alone on their own merit and don't need sexual overtones to sell.I am not saying this is the greatest album of all time, but its a solid addition to anyone's music collection."
5,Nice Looking Girl With A Great Voice,Hilary Ann Duff is a beautiful girl with a beautiful voice. Here music is uplifting and has a good lite rock sound. If you are a fan of Michelle Branch or any other singers in that genere then you will like Hil she is a new star on the rise. I think there will be alot more from her. She did great in her role as Lizzie McGuire in both the movie and on the Disney Channel Orginal TV show. Look for her in her up and comming films. Cheeper By The Dozen and Cinderella Story. Vist her web site to get all the information you need ... Buy this CD today and look for more from this artist on the rise.
4,I'm Surprised actually!,"I'm not a huge ""bubble gum pop"" fan, but this album was OK!A real spirit in this gals voice, the only downside is thata) Its a little repedetiveb) She couldn't sing a ballad for a sack of beans!A great buy! This is a fun album!"
1,...WTF is this...,omg this has got to be the worst CD ever... half of the time her voice is digitized because she can't sing at all. No idea how this even got on the charts.
5,Awesome,"This cd is awesome. It rocks.Here's my review of it.So Yesterday- I love this song.it rocks!Come Clean - I like it. One of my favourites.Workin'It Out - okay,every empowering.Little Voice - Awesome,it is a cool song.Where did I go right? - very slow, but nice lyricsAnywhere but here - very interesting,but coolThe Math - weird subject,but okayLove just is - I love this songSweet sixteen - very niceParty Up - good for dancingMetamorphosis - very rockish,not my typeInner strength - okay,very slowWhy not- This song rocks!"
3,Good.,The cd was good I am a really big fan of hilary so I liked the cd some of the songs were kind of weird though like 'party up' and 'little voice' I like SO YESTERDAY AND COME CLEAN i ALSO LIKE METAMORPHOSIS AND A COUPLE OTHERS! I think hilARY DID A OK JOB BUT SHE NEEDS TO MAKE MORE SONGS LIKE come clean. (^__^)
1,blah!,"I feel that hillary's voice is mostly enhanced by machines and fixer uppers. her voice actually kinda weak. she can hit notes ok, she's got a sense of tune, but her vioce has no richness, its pretty ordinary. I know 13 year olds that can sing so much better than her without any music or anything. the reason she's so big is just cause of Lizzie Migure and the movie and stuff. her reputation is built on looks and publicity. I never even knew she sang until I read an article. I think her stuff is really not worth it."
1,this girl cant sing,"this girl is horrible. someone should sit here down, and say, ""hey you should be glad with the fluke TV show thing...dont push your luck."" but, no...she has to waste our time with this type of junk music. come on! you think a record label would have even considered for 1/100 of a second to even let this person near a studio? no. its because she lizzie mcguire."
4,Childhood favorite,"I liked this cd and the songs on it. I just don't listen to it to much anymore. It's more of a childhood/teen years favorite,"
2,Major mistake....,"Yuck. With all of today's corporate major record labels trying to put a girl who can act, with NO singing ability at all is a major mistake. All these songs are horrible! How can one actually buy this album? Music these days has changed to this mode where everything has to be glamorous and charming and dollish.Miss Duff granted has one or two good songs on this album, but a whole album with the same beat over and over and over again can drive you insane.AVOID this album at all costs. Why waste your $13.98 when you can get something better, like earplugs or somethin? :)"
1,Someone give this girl some singing lessons!,"I know that Hilary Duff is extremely popular right now, but if anyone likes her who is over the age of ten they should be ashamed. I mean lets face it the girl can't act, nor can she sing."
1,Why?,"Do we really need another blonde pop ""artist"" who can't sing (aka Britney Spears) ? Hillary will be ""So Yesterday"" by this time two years from now, guaranteed."
1,Hilary Duff CD was icky :@(,"I was so excited about going to get the CD, but when I bought it and staa\rted listening to it, I thought that it was THE WORST ALBUM THAT I HAVE EVER LISTENED TO IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. Besides that Hilary doesn't exactly have the talent to put out a CD so I don't no why she did."
1,"oh look,it's a cash cow","oy, hillary duff. what made disney let you record this. they must have thought ""hey, her acting isn't bad enough, let's have her sing about herself in her highly annoying voice!!!! her fangirls will buy it and we'll make even more money!!!""another strike against pop"
5,THE one to buy,"This is a great version of Metamorphosis, the cover art is way more cool and the booklets inside are a great extra. It is really nice to have ""The girl can rock"" included and this is also one of the few places where you get ""A day in the sun"". It's not inexpeensive but it is worth it."
2,A good try....I guess,"First off, I have to say that I completely hate Hilary Duff, but I'm reviewing this as an open-mined person.Hilary Duff has a weak and ""little"" voice that is enjoyable to listen to.....that is if your 10 years old and wear lip gloss and eye shawdow. There nothing special about her voice. Half the people I know could sing better than her. Sure, she's a great role model, unlike some other singers out there, but what else is so great about her.I admit that some of the songs are cute. I mean that the songs personally are cute. Most of these songs would benefit greatly if it had sung by a singer with a decent voice. But some other songs are just bizarre. I mean the lyrics are all over the place and don't even make sense.The reason that I give the album 2 stars is because the songs and because I suppose Hilary does have potential. But she needs to take a good 2 years off and go and study with a good vocal coach and voice teacher. Then, maybe, she'll produce a better album."
3,"It's not bad, it's just blah","I'm not anti-Hilary Duff and I don't hate her. I just can't believe she is in the music business!! Anyone could sing the songs she sings! They are pretty much all on the same tone and the same few notes. If you want to buy something phenomenal, I wouldn't reccomend this album."
1,"RUFF-RUFF VOICE, BUFF-BUFFALO, HILARY DUFF!!!!! HILARY SUX","OK HILARY DUFF SUX LINDSAY LOHAN ROX ON EVERY TIGER BEAT MAG HD IS ON THE COVER AND GETS THE CLOSE UP LL IS ONLY FEATURED ON 1 PAGE HD IS FEATURED ON EVERY PAGE ALSO HER ALBUM SUX AND ON THE CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN PIC IT SHOULD BE AGE ORDER, SO IT'S PIPER (NORA) FIRST, TOM (CHARLIE) NEXT, THEN HILARY (LORAINNE) AFTER!!!! BUT SHE'S ONLY FIRST CUZ SHE'S THE BIG ""CELEBRITY!"" I'D CALL HER HOBO CUZ I WANNA SUE HER DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM IT'S NOT GOOD POP OR ROCK AND I KNOW MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Catchy Music with Mediocre Singing,"Okay, I confess that I actually like this album for the most part. But to see why, you have to understand what I value in music. I hardly listen to lyrics, so I wouldn't know if the lyrics in this album are as bad as everyone says. Also, I can forgive her rather weak and unmusical voice because, again, that's not my thing.I care mostly about the music in my music. And here I believe the album shines. I just want a catchy beat to tap my feet to, and this delivers the goods. If you're looking for insightful lyrics and great vocals, though, then you can probably skip this."
1,You've Got to be Kidding!!,"Being a Hilary fan, I gotta admit--this is possibly the worst album I've ever heard. With catchy beats, I seriously thought this CD was gonna be great.. that is, until Hilary started singing. Her lyrics are laughably lame and to make things worse, her irritating voice totally killed every song. Sorry Hilary, but singing's just not for you."
5,A must have for Hilary Duff fans!,"I love this CD!!!!!I like all the songs, especially ""So Yesterday,"" ""Little Voice,"" ""The Math,"" ""Sweet Sixteen,"" and ""Why Not.""If you like Hilary and you don't already have this CD, go and buy it!!!! If you don't know if you like Hilary or not, borrow it from someone or listen to it at a CD store! I'm sure you'll at least think it's okay.The only reason this CD got an average rating of three stars is because most of the people who reviewed it didn't like Hilary Duff! This is my favorite CD ever. You should at least give it a chance. I bet you'll really like it!"
1,"good girl, bad voice","I have nothing against Hilary Duff as an actor or person, but I really feel the need to say that I think her singing is the most obnoxious voice out there. As lots of reviewers have said, PLEASE stick to acting.. don't kill us."
2,Super-duper pre-teen bubblepop,"It's interesting to see how the reviews break down. They say this disc is either ""great!"" or ""it sucks!"" depending on whether the pre-teen girls writing them are still young enough to love this stuff, or just old enough to be embarrassed by the fact that they ever liked watching the Disney channel.After hearing ""The Math"" eighteen billion times in the car while driving my daughter to kindergarten, I still like it. It's a great song. It's a finely-crafted piece of bubble-metal New Wave sonic goodness.There! How's that?"
2,"If you're a FAN, buy it. It's your money...","Hilary Duff was manufactured to sell to the ""tweens."" That oh-so important group of girls who are barely teenagers but are tired of Barney sing-a-longs. These also happen to be the girls who fantasize about boys and love. That pretty much sums up lil Miss Hilary. She sings songs, that are written by 40+ year old men, about what love/heartbreak would be like. Don't expect any depth or actual singing ability on this CD. Heck, don't expect any actual substace from Duff until she gets some singing lessons and can writes her own lyrics.I'm giving her 2 stars, because I find her voice ""nice"" on ""So Yesterday."" It's no Christina Aguilera, but it sure beats Britney."
2,I just don't know...,"I really don't know about this CD. It kind of a lacks a certain flare, it's just not very good. As far as Hilary's voice goes, I think she needs voice lessons. She just doesn't have enough talent. As for her looks, she is very pretty, but that has nothing to do with the CD as far as I'm concerned. Overall, I would have to give this CD only 2 stars, because a few of the songs, such as Come Clean and Why Not, are worth listening to, yet songs such as Metamorphosis and many others, bring this CD down."
3,Good CD..but NOTE: CONTAINS SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES!,"I agree, hilary does have a nice sweet voice, but after a small investigation, I discovered that Hilary's songs carry subliminal messages! Here is what I discoveredlyric-at least not todaywhen played backwards-hail this nazi/natzi landlyric-i'm coming cleanwhen played backwards-Nazi/NatziI am looking at other of her songs now. Please try the songs out for yourself windows users, try speaking the words into your computer mic in the sound recoreder mode (start/programs/entertainment/soundrecorder)"
4,The Best Young Singer & Actress Ever,I'm a Big Fan of Hilary Duff.I think that she's a great Actress & Singer.I love her 1st Debut Album call Metamorphosis.I think it's a great CD THAT SHE HAS A GREAT VOICE.My 2 favorite songs she's sings on her album is So Yesterday & Come Clean.Hilary Duff is very cool.
1,Bad voice,"If you take Ozzy Osbourne's voice and put it together with Axl Rose's voice, Dave Mustaine's voice,and my voice, it would still sound better. (Nothing against Ozzy, Axl, and Dave. They are excellent for they're type of music. Unlike Ms. Fluff here.)"
1,Not That Great,"My cousin got me her CD and I have to say that it's not that great of a CD. Her singing is basically talking and it sounds too kiddish. She sings those ""annoying"" songs. When you first hear her songs, it's ok, but when you hear it over and over again it gets on your nerves!!! I personally don't like Hilary Duff's CD. It's too bubblish and she doesn't put feelings in her singing. I have to personally say her album shouldn't even be rated a 1 star. She should get def. get some vocal lessons done, and put feelings in her songs. Although, I don't like her as an actress either, I think she's just better off acting than singing."
3,It's Alright,Some of songs I like on the album but others are very annoying. For the first time making a cd she did pretty good.
1,Why Not STOP!,"I knew Hilary's CD was going to be horrible just after hearing her plain, flat voice on ""Why Not"", ""I Can't Wait"" and the Lizzie McGuire Movie. She's a pretty good actress, but why can't these Disney stars stick with acting?! Why do they all feel the need to sing when 98% of them CAN'T?!Of course, my younger sisters just *had* to have this so I have listened to it. I couldn't stand it, either.While she's not pure bubblegum, most of her CD is. The songs that aren't, I was like WTF?! Why's she trying to be some 'hard-core' when she can't even sing?Her voice displays NO emotion. It's flat, annoying and it's obvious Disney Records wants to squeeze all it's worth out of Ms. Duff.Hilary, stick to acting!"
3,Not that great,"I don't think Hilary Duff is cut out to be a music star. If she wants to pursue it, she needs more training. Her voice is computerized way too much. I only liked a few songs out of this whole album. Now I'm thinking I could have spent my money on something much better."
1,wannabe!,I used to be a huge fan of Hilary- but i realized that she was focusing on her singing career.At first it was kind of cute then became kind of dumb. Hilary has no vocal talent whatsoever! Stick to acting sweetie!
1,"deserves zero stars, but im forced to put one","the only people who listen to hillary duff are seven year olds who wear glitter eyeshadow, and guys who find her attractive! she doesnt even sing! the voice you are hearing is a computer! she lip sinks to everything! and its still sux even with all the computer alterations!"
1,Her voice...,The only difference between this disc and a Britney Spears CD is that Britney can actually sing... ugh...
5,Good Job Hillary for your first CD.,So Yesterday:10/10 Great Song!Come Clean:10/10 Best song on this whole CD!Workin'it Out:9/10 Pretty Good.Little Voice:10/10 Catchy!Where Did I Go Right?:9/10 This is one of the soft songs.Anywhere But Here:10/10 Good.The Math:10/10 Great Song.Love Just is:8/10 Okay.Sweet Sixteen:9/10 Great.Party Up:9/10 Good JobMetamorphosis:9/10 Great.Inner Strength:8/10 Sweet Song.Why Not:10/10 Great Song!
1,Lizzie McGuire goes WRONG,"Many say 'Why Not' is a HIT. WHY NOT? THIS IS WHY NOT!!!!!!This CD has proved that without the luck of landing Lizzie McGuire Hilary Duff would still be the same little Texas town girl she was 3 years ago. The popularity of the show has opened up endless possibilities for her career, but all very shallow--and talentless. Her voice is worst than Britney's, and it's unmistakable that the CD was thrown together to make quick cash. Don't waste your money people. Buy some Evanescence."
1,dont deserve #1,its for kids.. not recommended for teenage people.read the reviews before buying cd's people...
1,Hilary Cannot--repeat--CANNOT Sing!,"This girl--this blonde bimbo girl, CANNOT sing. Why does she waste her time singing when she must (not) know that she has fans? Who would waste good money on a CD that is pointless, and a must-not-listen-to? Spend your money on something else. This music sux! I don't know why Hilary can't see that. I mean, her album is ""number one"" in the country. Yeah, right! I soo believe that. NOT! Hilary's album shouldn't even be in the top 100 list. I have to be honest. This CD should recieve negative 2,395,957,489 stars. Well, this album is soooooo bad, it shouldn't even deserve ANY stars. Do us all a favor Hilary, and stop singing!! I'm deaf--but not completely. I choose to be completely deaf over listening to your CD. Oh, and by the way, did you get implants? Because they aren't very big--you bee-atch!"
4,Better than her second album,"I like Hilary's first album because its catchy and clean. I don't necesarilly like her. (she bugs me. she is such a POSER!!! ahem, sorry bout that) If you like pop, you will like this album. If you are too ""punk"" for this, why are you even reading this? That's what i thought! Get 'em boys! (*dogs fly through the computer screen at the innocent bystander*)Either way, don't buy her second album. Just stick to Metamorphosis. :-p"
2,mediocre pop music,"the problem with hilary duff is that she can't sing. it all comes down to that. if we ignore the fact that she's manufactured, writes none of her songs, and is just trying to make some more money, it all ends up with the simple fact that she is not a talented singer.the music isn't bad at all- a neat rock-pop blend, kinda along the lines of avril lavigne (because of the matrix's influence), but not quite as good. 'metamorphosis' may have been a hit, but it sure did not deserve to be. please stick to the acting, hilary; your'e not bad at that, and you have a great future there.peace"
3,just stop,"Stop acting like such an uncivilized tard, Tripple O7, you're spamming like a freakin' n00b(Which, no doubt you are) And I wish you really would jump off a building, we could use less people like you in this world. Why did you say that Kim and music fan say the same things over again when YOU do worse?????? All you say is ""Shut up you b**ches. You're retarded, get your act together. This cd is sooooo good. all the haters need to shut the f**k up. All you care about is Lindsay Lohan"" So, it all goes back to you, I think you would be the ""retard""."
2,"Sorry, Hilary Duff","Hilary has been very popular thoughout an year especially being big in the year of 2003. She is constantly dealing with other teen idols and probably has enough stress than it already is. Hilary is not one of the world's greatest singers, but fortunely her album did go platinum(I think). However her album is not one of my favorites, but I still love you Hilary Duff!!! I give her album 2 stars."
3,Ok i guess,"This CD is alright if ur a hilary fan. I listened to a few songs and i seemed to like: So yesterday, Come Clean, Metamorphosis and Inner Strength.hilary doesnt have a great voice but what can u do..shes 16. Metamorphosis would definatly something to listen to if u wanna Dance/sing along."
5,Better than i expected,"When i first heard of Hilary Duffs album being released i immediately thought it would be aimed more so at the 10-12 age group. I soon found out that this was wrong, although some of the tracks are a bit too happy go lucky the rest are very professional and shows Hilary's range of singing talents, as said in other reviews Hilary does use a similar type of song characteristic to that of Britney Spears and in some points her songs sound extremely like Britney Spears. I gave Hilarys album 5 stars because i think certain songs such as Come clean and why not are very good for a girl of 15 soon to be 16 years of age."
4,Metamorphosis,Hilary's CD was great! She did such a good job for being so young. I recomend this to anybody who likes her previous songs. It is a great CD for young girls and fun to listen to! :)
4,Pretty infectious,"This is actually pretty good. I listened to the title track metamorphosis first, and thought oh no this is going to be one of those wannabe albums, but a close listen, and this album shines more. fav track is 'so yesterday'. Her voice is naturally melodic and laid back, and makes this an enjoyable listen."
2,Disappointed in Hilary,"When I first heard Hilary sing on the Disney Channel, I thought ""WOW!"" this girl can sing!, but after listening to her CD (I, unfortunately, bought her cd to hear if she could really sing), I was WRONG! Her voice is so weak, I can't believe someone actually thought otherwise. I suggest to Hilary to get more extensive voice lessons to strengthen her already weak vocals. I'm not a singer, but I can distinguish a really great singer (like Whitney Houston) from a mediocre one like Hilary."
1,Im being honest,"Okay to be perfectly honesti dont hate hilary duff because i dont know herfor all i know she could the kindest person alivebut i must say this album defintley sucksthe songs have no depth or soulit is obviously not her real voicei dont like music where the singer didnt write the lyricsand i can tell there was no real work put into thisif you want music with meaning and souli suggest you try, Matchbox 20, 2pac, Savage Garden, Goo Goo Dolls, and Stained"
3,=),1. So Yesterday - 5/102. Come Clean - 8/103. Workin' It Out - 7/104. Where Did I Go Right? - 7/105. Anywhere But Here - 7/106. The Math - 5/107. Love Just Is - 7/108. Sweet Sixteen - 5/109. Party Up - 6.5/1010. Metamorphosis - 7/1011 Inner Strength - 5/1012. Why Not - 7/10
4,Not Bad. Not Bad At All.,"I was not expecting great things from Hilary Duff on the musical front, but I must admit I enjoy listening to this CD from start to finish. I like almost every song (except for one--Party Up), and a few of them continue to grow on me the more I hear them. Little miss Duff has a pleasant singing voice; she doesn't have the power and/or range of certain other vocalists out there, but her voice seems perfectly suited to the songs recorded here. These are fun, lighthearted, catchy tunes--who better to sing them than someone with a fun, lighthearted, carefree voice like Hilary Duff. I am very happy I bought Metamorphosis."
2,NOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR,When i bought this cd i thought it would be another excellent cd in pop history. Instead I got something that was so bad i traded it in. METARMORPHOSIS is one of the worst albums ive ever heard. COME CLEAN is such a bad song it should come with a government warning. SO YESTERDAY and PARTY UP are probablly the only excellent songs. Teriblle. Go spend your money on Jewels 0304
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!,"This CD redefines horrible! The girl can't sing a note, yet she has multi-million dollar record deal! Please don't waste your time on the crappy songs with lyrics like ""If the light is off, then it isn't on!"" What's worse is that she didn't write a word on the entire ""album."" Leave this CD on the shelf cause its not even worth a penny!!!"
2,Unbiased,"We're talking bout hillary duff the singer not actress so we'll stick to dat...She is a lousy singer, she is another young teeny-booper rinding on the waves of publicity generated by her marketing ppl, disney show, etc. She did'nt create and album ad release it, her agent+songwriters did dat and paid her to sing and put her picture on the cover. PL, don't sing it if u don't mean it.Yeah, she's cute so she gets 2 stars"
2,nice try but....,"I can't stand Hilary Duff. But, my personal hatred for her aside, this CD is still not very good. Hilary's voice needs A LOT of work. She has one of those voices where if she was singing with friends or in public, nobody would cover their ears, and she wouldn't be embarassed to sing. However, for her to make an album is ridiculous. If she wasn't already ""Lizzie McGuire"", nobody in their right mind would give her a record deal. Maybe with alot of voice training and when she gets a bit older, she might make a half decent singer, but by then probably nobody will even care about her."
1,I am very disapointed,"I was excited about this CD coming out until I previewed it on AOL First Listen. She only has 2 good songs on the whole CD. I liked Why Not and So Yesterday, but the rest of the songs were horrible. It can't be described as bubble gum pop, I don't know what to call it! I am glad I previewed it before I bought it so I didn't waste my money. Hilary has a great voice but her songs are lacking. She needs to find someone new to write her lyrics."
3,Bad Follow Up,"Metamorphasis was a bad follow up from Santa Clause Lane. Not half as good. There are some good hits like So Yesterday, come clean, but otherwise not very good."
3,I dont Like her but.....,"ok i really dont like Hilary Duff because i thunks shes too perfect(cant you tell im a teen!!)But i think shes an inspiration for all young wannabe actors. I want to be an actor an i think its great that she only 16 and has already got a platnum album. She might not be the best of singers but at least she tries and gets a good result.Does it really matter thats she doesnt write her own songs???Britney, Blue(im from the UK),Sugababes all dont write their own songs and yet they still sound good.I think Hilary should be praised for whats she is doing she is an inspiration to young people, even though i dont like her America should be proud that they have so much young talent."
2,Let the kids have it,"Hillary Duff can't sing and she's a midiocre actor who lucked her way into a Disney Lead because she's cute. And now she matured into a beautiful teenage girl, so they sell her another way.But one day she will fade into the realm of 'whatever happened to' so I don't worry about the kids listening to this CD, they'll outgrow it in less than two years and in the meantime it's harmless. So while it's not the most brilliant thing the music industry has ever seen, it's harmless fun. So let the kids have it."
2,"Well, At Least She's Got A Beautiful Mind.","Miss Duff is the most phenomenal musical deity since Mozart...wait a minute, she's even greater than that lame little eighteenth-century Viennese pissant! Such towering musical magnificence comes along but once in the entire history of our pitiful species, so cherish it while you can!It's a shame, though, that she's so ghastly to look at. (Hillary, dear, you might want to consider a little plastic surgery.)"
2,Hilary Duff.....stick to acting....,"This CD is horrible... the only song i like on this whole CD is ""So Yesterday"" the rest of the songs just DON'T fit her voice. she wrote NONE of the songs so i can't give her any credit for that. She just tries to be Avril Lavigne in half her tracks, like ""The Math"", ""Party Up"" and ""Metamorphosis"" sound JUST like songs that were on Avril's album. She has NEVER done a live concert *with her REAL voice* so i would think her voice is totally fake...take my advise DONT buy this CD just download it for FREE. Her voice gets so tiring, you'll get sick of this CD after listening to it for 3 days, so do yourself a favor and SAVE ur money. Hilary...just stick to acting...at least ur a little decent at that *but not great* ...."
1,"I'm Sorry, But...","I listened to this CD, 'cause my friend has it. And it was NOT good. Hilary CANNOT sing.I know most people are going to read this and think, ""Well, she's wrong!"" Remember, this is MY opinion! I think it's bad; some people might enjoy the CD. So you should buy it and see for yourself."
1,You Have Got To be Kidding Me,"Okay, did I miss someting? Are they letting just anybody record an album these days? Hillary, no offense, but you can't sing. I'm sorry, but it just sounds like your talking except with a deeper voice. In every movie your in you're playing the same person:the so-called ""dorky"" character the hot guy has a secret crush on.Your music's boring, it's all been done before! You're so not original. I'm 14 and in that age group that's supposed to love you, but I'm far from doing that."
1,What it sounds like when the music industry hits rock bottom,"If you thought it was not possible for pop music to get any worse than it has in recent years, Miss Duff's debut CD will prove you wrong. This album is full of unfathomable lyrics backed by a 15 year old girl who has no vocal abilities. Why this girl even thought she could pull off singing is sad, but what is more depressing is that there are thousands of talented, unsigned bands out there that are actually worthy of putting out a record, but instead, we are ""blessed"" with ""musicians"" like Hilary Duff. Don't buy this album, don't even download it. It is especially not worth it since the recent lawsuits. If you are around 7 years old, you may enjoy this album. If you like songs with substance, stay away from this awful piece of trash and listen to some real music."
2,Hillary.........,"[...]Her voice is okay,nothing to scream over.And I'm not exactly exited to hear her sister,Haylie,sing."
1,God save us all!,"""Omygod! I'm like sototallypopular! see how popular I am?""Yes, HD is hot. but now, she's ruining the world! why is it that on the cover she looks like a dying llama? weird mental picture..."
1,Come on people!,"People on this website are acting like Hilary is some kind of goddess. Well, personally, I don't agree. One thing for sure, it's rather shocking that people over the age of 15 are listening to this. It's even more shocking that guys over the age of 15 are listening to this. I'm reading reviews that this album is the best album of all time. Anyone who thinks this is the best album of all time needs a reality check. Okay, fine, I won't tell you to not buy this album. Do what you want. Waste your fifteen bucks. See if I care. When you reach adulthood and look back at your CD collection you'll look at this CD and be like ""Why did I like her anyway?"""
1,Try Again,"Hilary, you really need to work on that voice. This CD is not much of cd. Hilary's voice is immature and little-kid sounding and eventually gets annoying. Do not recommend!"
1,"Amazing, extraordinary, brilliant, revolutionary.......","NOT. Those words should never be used near this girl. Pure pubescent fluff. If you have a short attention span, love to dance, and doesn't like to think, then this is for you. To the person that said music should only be about fun and being happy, HA, how sad, but I can see why that person would say that since the average age range of this album is 8-10 year olds. What do they know about real music or real emotions and soul. We all that the only reason this girl even got a record deal was because of ""Lizzy Mcquire"". No record label, in their right mind would sign this girl. She doesn't even deserve my change if she were playing on a street corner. One day, her record label is going to say ""GOTCHA"" and that this is all a joke.Throwaway ""artist"", throwaway trash."
1,Terribe CD,This girl is getting rich off this Garbage. She is a no singing talent-less girl. This is what is music industry has come down to. Sad Indeed.
1,Why not Get off your fat ass and lose some weight!,"Hilary Duff needs a computer to make an album, not mentioning disney. She acts all sweet and disses artists such as Lindsey Lohan and Avril Lavine (which her record label helped make this crappy album.) Just face the facts people she can't sing or act. The only place she should be is on the farm. AKA she looks like livestock! DON'T BUY THIS HORRIBLE CD!!!!!!"
1,Hilly Vinilli,"I've yet to hear that this girl can sing. When you have to lip synch (badly) performances of manufactured singing, thats not really singing. Any sixteen year old could have turned this out in a karaoke booth."
2,WTF! THIs Cd IS not that good!Q,"OK first of all, people who rate this cd 5 stars are either little dumb kids under 9 years old. This cd is pure crap with an exception of some good songs like Come clean, so yesterday and why not. HER boice is jsut awful. I dont understand how she go a recording deal. Her voice is ssssssssssooooooooooooooo weak and she has no pwer to it. SHe has the wors voice in this music industry along with Jennifer Lopez and Ashlee Simpson. There are better artists out there today that have amazing voice but dont get much credit for it like Jojo for example who's younger than Hilary and has a powerhouse voice. Anyways skip this talentless babe. I do have to admitt, she is pretty hot. BUT HILARY SHOULDNT EVEN MAKE ANOTHER CD AGAIN. She should stick to acting. Wait actually shes not good at acting either. then she might as b a model or join the porn industry when she gets older. But skip this cd and get anything by Britney spears, Christina Aguilera, or evanescence"
1,Hilary Fluff sucks,"She doesn't even sing! She lip-synchs to 20 sweaty malle back-up singers!! For good music listen to Children of Bodom, Lacuna Coil, Chimaira, Megadeth, Metallica (even the new stuff's better than this crap!), Sevendust, etc."
1,What Kind Of Crap Is This???,"This album doesn't deserve a star. Yeah, it's really THAT BAD!I'm sorry but the girl just cannot sing. Listen to the sniplets and you'll know what i mean. You'll be better off investing your money in something else."
1,HILARY DUFF IS A POSER!!!,"Please, don't waste your money on Hilary Duff.Save your money from this crap!She is a complete poser.I can't believe she is dating Joel Madden.Joel deserves a girl so much more better.And now Hilary Duff is trying to be punk!A blonde punk,I don't think so.So please believe me when I say this is gimmicky corporate crap.She wasn't satisfied with being an actress(which she sucked at)and now she wants to be punk.If she would have stayed pop I wouldn't care as much, but now she crossing into my territory(punk). [...]"
1,SUCKS!!!,"HAHAHAHAHA, Hilary Duff sucks, her voice is whiney, her lyrics are cheesy, not only that but she has a stuck up attitude that's really annoying. I hate how she thinks she's better than everyone else, and she's a sellout, her acting on Disney is poor and her music/singing skills are poor. The only why people buy her albums is because she's an actor on Disney. HILARY DUFF YOU SUCK!!Hahaha, Hillary Duff, more like HILLARY DUFFEL BAG, HAHAHHAAHAHAHA!!!"
1,What crap!,Are you some of you people giving this CD 5 stars retarted or somthing? It is sooooo obvious that it is only a money gimmick. And I'm frightened to know people over ten like this CD. IT IS MADE FOR 5-8 YEAR OLDS! And it is obvious that HER VOICE ISN'T REAL. It is almost completally computer generated. And Hilary Duff isn't amazing for making it to the top and getting a music contract and a TV show. HER DAD IS A BILLIONAIRE AND BOUGHT HER THOSE THINGS. Don't buy this crap CD and support this loser.
1,"Nice ass, Bad music",This album reinforces why the music industry values looks over musical talent. My guess is that should be the other way around. She should be gone within a couple of years.
1,Hilary Sucks,"Hilary's cd metamorphis is bad, I absoulty hate it. My dog makes better sounds then her. I got this cd as a present so I couldn't return it, if I could I would. It sounds awful. My grandpa can sing better than her!! The only people I can think of that might like her cd is 5-7 year olds who don't know any better. So do yourself a favor and DON""T BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!"
1,Horrible: Review by Teen & People Magazine.,"I am a review for Teen/People magazine. This is a horrible album. These days, anyone can get a record deal. Raven belonged getting it. Besides Hilary's ugly looks, this W.A.S.P. cannot sing at all. She sounds horrible-her voice is always breaking & she cant hit any note that actually songs well! She didn't write any songs & the lyrics are not for children. This album deserves A BIG FAT ""F""- for a big ugly, no talent, s**pot,W.A.S.P.!!!!!"
3,My 7 Year Old Daugher Loves It,"I think Hilary Duff does an adequate job on this CD, especially at her age, though it's true that she doesn't demonstrate much vocal range or versatility. But that's pop music I guess. My little girl (who is 7) loves Hilary (big Lizzie McGuire fan) and really enjoys listening to this CD. We have it in the CD changer in the car and she begs me to play The Math, So Yesterday and Why Not over and over again. Though I prefer Bob Dylan, I'll admit that So Yesterday has grown on me, too."
1,Quite Terrible,This CD has been giving me a hard time since my little sister bought it a year ago. I have been tortured while trying to listen to Agaetis Byrjun (a CD by a GOOD artist called Sigur Ros) by being interrupted by this poor excuse for music. It lacks originality and is very uninspired (sorry for being redundant)(...)That's all.
2,Serves its purpose,"Many people have reviewed this cd badly for the wrong reasons. First off, I have no interest in this genre of music. I generally listen to more traditional stuff like the Eagles (Hell Freezes Over is the best CD ever made) and James Taylor and rock like Lacuna Coil. My little cousins however do listen to this. Hilary Duff's music is perfect for them. With all of our kids listening to eminem and christina aguilera's adult lyrics nowadays, it's nice to see music that isn't suggestive or offensive playing on the radio. I'd rather our kids listen to this than most of pop culture music."
5,Nice Job Hilary.,"I realy dont like pop music,but Hilary has totally changed my outlook on it. I saw her on nick constontly and finally bought the cd and wasnt sorry.I recomend this to any pop music fan.She also has some rock on this cd.I hope she keeps making music like this.Awsome job Hilary!"
3,"Not bad, but nothing special.","I really like Hilary, but I thought this CD had a lot of songs with corny lyrics. So Yesterday and Why Not are the tracks on this CD where she shines, but nothing else seemed to grab me. I think she should stick to acting because that's where her talent is truly at."
3,Not sure yet.....,"This is actually a review of the album cover, not the CD, -- reviewing the CD would obviously be a waste of time.She looks cute, but empty. Glamorous, yet cheap. I also can't forget that no matter how good her pictures look, she has ""aligator arms"".OK...I'm giving it a 3.....lickable but not forgivable."
3,so hilary duff huh?,"ok to be fair I dont like hilary as a person(she seems very boring) but hey So yesterday and Come clean got in my head and a friend dared me to buy the album.so heres my review...the tracks get boring and repetative after a while,the lyrics are boring and cliche and the her voice aint great(big deal). But the album does have highlights (come clean,so yesterday,why not,workin it out) at least theyre catchy pop and not filler pop.I never thought I'd say this to Duff but...Try harder"
4,So far so good,"I'm listening to the fifth track right now. So far, I've been pleasantly surprised. She's obviously no Kelly Clarkson, but the songs are catchy and her vocals are nothing to be ashamed of. Great job, Hilary!"
4,I'm not a preteen and I like the album!,"Hilary is one my favorite new artists so I was very excited about her new album being released. One of the reasons why I enjoyed listening to it was because it wasn't awful bubbly pop but it was kind of rock. I can also relate to life as a 16 year old, so the CD is like daily life. The best songs are:= So Yesterday= Come Clean= Where did I go Right?= Anywhere but Here"
5,Impressive Debut.,"This is a really impressive debut from Hilary. My fav songs from it are Sweet Sixteen, Why Not, The Math, Anywhere But Here and my favourite Hilary song to date, Come Clean. I also love the title track alot. Hilary Duff is a prime example of someone who shows what teen pop should sound like for all teenagers. Her voice also has potential, and she has a good enough voice to carry a tune.Plus, to the kids review a few reviews below mine, I am also a boy (13-year old) and agree with everything you said.Anyway, this debut from Hil definately shown an impressive and successful career. Her other albums that follow, Hilary Duff and Most Wanted, a collection of songs, remixes and new tracks, are also great.Cheers for reading!"
5,Amazing,The best Cd ever.Hilary Duff is the best artiest and actrice.Every Fan Most Buy This CD!!!!!!!!!!!!Hilary Duff is cute 2 from inside and outside!!
1,Not Enjoyable,"I did not liek Hilary Duffs album. She should at least have dance moves like Britney. Britney Spears, also sings better than Hilary Duff. I saw Hilary Duff live on TV and she doesnn't sing live."
1,The worst singer in history...,"Or maybe tying with Britney Spears. My number one peeve? She doesn't write ANY songs...as juvenile and undeveloped as those songs are, a three year old could write them and they're too ""deep"" for the mind of Hilary Duff.However, I can overlook lack of creativity when there is a great vocal talent at work (like Christina Aguilera's first album, or Whitney Houston) but this girl has the most horrible, computerized singing voice in history! No range, she sounds ridiculously young, and her voice has no emotion in at all. Disney/Buena Vista is just capitalizing on the whole Lizzie McGuire and teen pop phenomenon, and it makes me want to throw up."
1,worthless CD for sale!!,"This is not good music. I bought this cd three weeks ago and I must say, I'm VERY disappointed. I haven't touched it since. Hopefully I can squeeze a few pennies from mindless 11 year olds by selling it on EBAY. Anyone interested? Let me know."
5,She rocks!,"I think hilary duff is the koolest singer in the world.She is bueatiful, hip, a movie and tv star, and has the best singing voice i have ever heard. She is also my role model.I wish i could be just like her.We are the same in alot of ways. We both have two dogs, a sister, and a love for pop music.And best of all, the same birthday.Before this summer i hated music. All music, until i heard metamorphisis.My favorete song are the math and sweet sixteen.I even convinced my mom to take me to hilarys concert in december.I was in the FIRST row. The music was blasting in my ears, but i did not care.I actually got to see hilary in person! I will never forget it as long as i live."
2,Not worth your money,"I personally would not waste my money on this CD. Hilary Duff does not have any musical talent; she has little range and has an immature voice. I really cannot stand to listen to her for very long. However, the songs on this CD are very catchy. She was lucky for that. But she only got this record deal because she was already famous from Lizzie McGuire. If you really like Hilary Duff, go ahead and buy this CD (the songs are pretty good), but I wouldn't recommend it as she has absolutely no singing talent. The songs could have been sung better by someone else who truly deserves a record deal."
2,How does a tv star become a singer? come on...get real,"What the hell has music come to these days? why would a record label just sign up a actress that doesn't have any talent singing? wtf is this... how the hell does a tv star just become a singer out of no where? does she even write her own lyrics? thats the problem with pop music these days... they are all crappy lyrically and have no effort put in it... the only good music that actually has some work put forth into is alternative rock/rock/metal etc.... rap is just about being a gangster, murder and b*tches and hoes."
1,OH GOD KILL ME NOW,"this CD is a form of torture! WHO THE HELL CAN STAND THIS CRAP???? Hillary Duff is a dumbsh*t blonde who can't sing her way out of a paper bag. It isnt even her voice singing and it sux. Soooooo if they tamper with her voice, she must suck even more than she does now, just when you think shes hit rock bottom. Shes also a Class A B*tch, didnt u all hear that she demanded more money from Disney, so they fired her a*s??? who the hell wants to listen to a money hungry, prep, who cant sing worth a sh*t?????"
3,Metamorphosis=an OK time!,Thia CD is a great start for the pop sensation Hilary Duff. She is sure to suceed in the music business. The CD is exactly what a first-time timy-bopper should produce. Just wait she blow your mind later down the road.So Yesterday=8/10Come Clean=9/10Workin' It Out=6/10Little Voice=4/10Where Did I Go Right=3/10Anywhere But Here=2/10The Math=4/10Love Just Is=1/10Sweet Sixteen=10/10Party Up=2/10Metamorphosis=7/10Inner Strength=1/10Why Not=7/10Overall=6/10
4,a good pop cd.,"I feel the Metamorphosis cd had some catchy songs such as Little Voice, Anywhere But Here and Metamorphosis as well ad the first two singles. The only song I wasn't really impressed with was The Math. I think Hilary has a bright future in the music industry and will only get better with time. I predict that when her next cd is released there will be a noticeable improvement. She does have the talent to have a great career in the business. Overall this cd surpassed my expectations having several good songs and I think if a third single is released it should be Metamorphosis"
1,Her 15 minutes are almost up...*tick tock*,"When I first saw her CD come out I thought, 'hey! she must have a good voice if she got a deal with a record company at only 15! I bought her CD at Fred Meyer's for $10 then popped it in my CD player.FIVE MINUTES AFTER LISTENING TO IT I THREW IT AWAY...Her voice is pathetic in all of the songs..especially in Little Voice, Why Not, So Yesterday, Come Clean, Sweet Sixteen, PRACTICALLY every song!Plus, must I add, a song called 'INNER STRENGTH' IS ONLY 1.5 MINUTES LONG!!! showed how desperate they were to fill the CD up and sell sell sell and make $$$$$...~*~*~*So please, do not waste your valuable money and spend it on Britney Spears' new CD or Dido's this holiday season~*~*~*~"
2,"Not the best, but not the worst",I got it when it first came out and I liked it for a while. Some of the songs are pretty and some are the kind of music that the 2 year olds I babysit dance to. I thought it would be different since she wasn't really so Disney anymore. It doesn't really have the little bit of rock I heard it would. Buy it if you like it. I didn't really like it much but everyone has their own opinions so don't resist buying the cd if you really want it.
1,sound like hilary!,"kk, my friend debbie is a really good singer, and she can sound just like hillary duff. all she does is holds her nose while she sings. hillary duff is a horrible singer and this album is horrible 2! she needs to stick 2 acting. she only got a record album cuz she was already famos, so they couldn't turn her down. if she wasn't famous, and she went on american idol, she wouldn't make it"
2,What?,"I have no clue why some of these songs are on so much. Hillary has an ""Ok Voice"" ( but she should stick with acting ). My only problem with this CD are the lyrics and its lack of origionality. For example is So Yesterday she says ""If the light is off it isnt on""....What? And on Come Clean she says ""trying to fit a sqaure into a square was my life"", right there she's trying to sound deep but not doing a good job. But what bugs me the most is this is another CD with just a bunch of love songs. Theres nothing except love songs. And what is she like 15? What could she possibly know about love?I gave her a 2 cause i felt sorry for her."
2,ohh my god,"i just can't control myself when i heard the whole album,this album is for people who under the 15!!!!i gave it 2stars for: so yesterday,come clean,where did i go right? & why notthose songs are really cute,pretty!!!she can't sing,her voice is too low,she need to practise more!!!!"
2,How can you be a BIG fan of her?,"She's so COMMON! God, it's ridiculous. I see 10,000 girls a day that look and act just like her stuck up face. I've heard the signles off this album... pure GARBAGE! Just sell this crap to those pop hungry retards.DUFF IS A COW AND EATS CRAP!"
1,Hilary Duff Should Metamorphasize of her fat ass!,"This CD is one of the worst albums ever. I wish Hilary would actually sing her songs, instead of having a computer sing them for her while she has mickey D's in her mouth. A lyric from this album is ""if you can't do the math get out of the equation."" I guess the got out of the equation after she did the math with calorie consumption per day, that was a losing battle, the number on the calculator was to big to fit on the tiny screen. If you want to hear this cow moo in all the songs buy it. But for the safety of all minors, keep this locked up!"
1,ugggh whats wrong with u people,my stupid aunt bought me this cd for my b day and thinking i actually like her well my mom said to put it in the cd player to make my aunt feel good while i listned i had to think happy thought to keep from making ugly faces though hilary beat me 2 it on her CD cover. as soon as my aunt left i broke the CD in half and threw it away my mom wasnt 2 happy but it felt so good
3,so yesterday,"when you 1st get it you want to listen to it, but after like a year you don't want to. Some people love it forever but I think it is just okay. So yesterday gets on your nerves so much and little voice isn't any better. But Sweet Sixteen, metamorphois, and workin' it out are probably my only favorites."
2,Ok....,"Well, I don't have the album but I've listened to quite a few songs that she sings from this album. What is up with that ""Little Voice"" song? She sounds demented or something..."
5,Not What it Seems,"This is an exceptional debut, not perfect but definately memorable. Skip right over So Yesterday as it is by far the worst song on the album. Come Clean is a good showcase for young Ms. Duff's great voice. Workin it Out has that classic line ""Hard enough to be who you are, harder to be what you're not, Hard to know what you need to get, Harder to know what you got!"". Do we have hidden philosophy lessons in with apparently kiddie songs? Yes!!! Party Up is irresistably groovy. The title track also jams. Inner Strength also has some sage advice for just the type of teeny boppers listening to this album. The lyrics for Why Not? however should have been left as they appear on the Lizzie Movie Soundtrack. If you can get around some of the lame popishness, there's some great tunes here."

5,Metamorphosis...simply amazing.,"This album shows people that Hilary really can sing! these songs are simply amazing! Songs about love, and breaking up, songs about turning 16, and about her family, and friends! to songs about changing in life! This CD contains something for everyone!"
5,Best CD Ever,"Its the best. If you like Hilary's Movies, Songs, and Television Show you will not be dissipointed!"
4,Great upbeat music!,"Great CD with awesome songs, her voice isn't as mature as it might be in the future but that can be overlooked because this CD is carried by the mix of music, not entirely her vocal talent."
1,If I could I'd give no stars at all,I have never been a fan of Hilary Duff. The only reson my ears have suffered from listening to this cd is beacuse of my 10 year old sister. Hilary Duff horrible voice takes perfectly good song lyrics and turns them into songs no person in their right mind would listen to. Her voice is way to hign and squeaky during the songs. The only people I know who listen to this cd is 10 year olds. If your a teen don't waste your money on this cd. I mean Brittany Spear's is better then this. That should give you an idea how bad this cd really is. Do
3,I thought it was okay,"I bought it.. thought it was okay.. Listened to it a few times.. And started to like it.. there are a few songs i still kinda dont like... But my favorite would have to be ""Where did i go right"" it's one of the cd's that stays in my cd player that i listen to every night. and so it grew on me because i played it over and over. ""So Yesterday"" is also a good song. ""Anywhere but here"" and ""Love just is"" are also some of my favorites. I dont really care for ""The Math"" or ""Sweet 16."" But I would recomend this cd."
2,UmMmM..YeAh,"I'll give Hilary Duff-Man (lil inside joke) one thing. She doesn't sound very bad. I mean yeah when I heard that she made a CD I did roll my eyes but she isn't a bad singer, she just sings the wrong stuff. 'So Yesterday' isn't a bad song either. But the rest of her songs are as good as gone. Or maybe corny in other words. I dislike (not hate) Hilary's lyrics. Even in 'So Yesterday' I didn't like her lyrics but it's still a good song. The lyrics and some songs are kind of childish, which she's a child herself or teen which that explains it.I recommend just buying the single for 'So Yesterday' because the rest of her CD isn't the best thing in the world. But that's my opinion on it."
1,Hilary Sucks!!!,"This is one of the worst albums that I've ever heard. Every song sounds the same. Hilary's voice is awful. She can't sing. She should go back to doing t.v. shows and movies. She's just using her fame to do music not because she has musical talent. People like her because they like her in Lizzie Mcguire not because she has musical talent which she doesn't. If you want to hear artists with musical talent check out Britney Spears ""In the zone"" or Christina Aguilera ""Stripped""."
1,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Hilary Duff is a great actress and she played a great part in Lizzy McGuire. But this? No way! I mean, why does she now go crazy in the music business when she is already on a great show. She is also on the new movie Cheaper By the Dozen. That is okay. But this, no no no no no!!!!!!!"
2,"Great actress, but...","Jennifer Love Hewitt tried it. So did J. Lo. And now, Hilary Duff. Actresses trying to break into the music business. Very few are successful. I don't believe that Hilary Duff is one of those people.Now, don't get me wrong. I loved Hilary Duff on Lizzie McGuire. She's a great actress and it was a good show. The fact remains, though, that while she does possess acting talent, she is sadly lacking in the area of natural singing talent. Unfortunately, Hilary's voice is not groundbreaking, and what she does sing is often covered up by the multitudes of background singers on all of the songs. Most of the tracks on this album come across as sugary, overproduced, typical pop songs. Overall, Hilary is a great actress, and acting is where she should stay."
3,better luck next time!,"i really love Hilary's vioce, but most of the songs on this album sound the same! I like a couple of songs on this CD, like ""So Yesterday"" and ""Come Clean"", and ""Why Not"", but the rest are either really sad or really happy."
3,Hmmm.....this album is not all that bad,"Ok.....people who are being so nieve, the girl is only 16 years old..much like myself. I know you feel she cannot sing, and it may be true. The way i judge the music I listen to, is where the singer is coming from, and how well the music relates to me. Personally, my favorite song off of Hilary's album would be ""Let the rain fall down."" For me, I just listen to that song and it just gives me faith. I know some of you may not feel this way, but, all I have to say is, don't just listen to the tone, listen to the lyrics. Figure them out, becasue Hilary's music is deeper then it seems. Just take the time out to notice it."
4,This is better than I thought!,"I think Hilary Duff has done better than everybody think of her in this album. Because everyone thought she just want to sing only to make more money, but actually it has proved that she is multi-talented. She really made an effort to make her album good and it is really good to listen to even though she can improve this."
1,CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Has it not occured to any of you little 8 year olds that hilary duff has no talent. Her songs are not just her singing. She has been helped by a bunch of computers and machines to it sound like she is what you call ""singing"" but even after all of that I can say that it does not sound much like music. She really doesn't have any talent whatsoever and I am surprised by how many adoring fans she has out there. I also think it is a load of crap that she is coming out with a Greatest Hits CD even though she has only made 2 other CD's. [...]"
2,Hilary Duff,"Hilary Duff is almost as phony as it gets. Sometimes she's sappy sweet, sometimes she's the tough girl with thick mascara. Sometimes she and her sister are ""best friends who do everything together""...gag...and sometimes Hilary is a mix of everything.Hilary's voice is so average that even I could sing like her. She has catchy songs, but that's thanks to the people who wrote the songs, not her.I agree with everyone that gives this CD a bad review. Hilary Duff needs to either go back to Lizzie McGuire, where she was actually good, or pack her bags and head home."
2,My Review,"Hilary Duff is pretty good for a starting-out singer, but she doesn't have a particularly gifted voice, but the song lyrics for some of the songs I like a lot. Hilary duff should've stayed an actress, she was a tiny bir better then. She wasn't a phenomenal actress either but she was ""cute"" (in personality.) The Math and Cme Clean are very good though! I really like The Math."
1,in a word....FLATULENCE.,"to be fair,i shouldnt be judging her with my knowledge of what real music is.after all,she is a kid and she is aiming her''music''at unknowing kids.as adults,we can differentiate between good/HORRIFIC.kids cannot.my girlfriend and her daughter have put me through some of entertainments worst.being the trooper that i am,i deal with it.but even when i try to see what it is about some of their viewing/listening choices,im at a complete loss.it doesnt take much talent to have a dozen people write your songs and another dozen to produce it.if you ask britney,janet,any boy band,miracles can be made in a studio.giving those who would get thrown out of their own shower a somewhat sappily melodic voice.thats another guage i use that kids dont.how does performer sound live?im sure hilary's fluff is harmless cheese,but its not very good.or any good.kids of today will never know what real entertainment is."
1,TERRIBLE,Talk about someone who should never sing! She has no talent whatsoever and this CD should no longer be sold. I can't even describe the terrible quality of this CD. Hilary Duff and Lindsay Lohan should just remain teeny bop actors!
1,utter ....,"My cousin had this playing in the car. It was bad, and I mean really bad. If you are into that Justin-Britney-Pink type bile, then this will suit you just fine. Just don't call it music."
1,sux. pft waste of money if you 13 n over,argggggghhhhhhhhh. omgggggggggggggggah ok so im humiliated that i used to be a hilary duff fan but look her actings pretty good. I'd watch her movies but buying her screaming voice and sucky guitar banging songs is just a rip off. Omg hilary duff is so not as good as lindsay in singing. Hilary is trying to be a punk and guess what it's not working! Her songs really are catchy and cool but her voice is overated by machines.
1,I have came to the conclusion that,"Nowdays talent doesn't matter...this is a prime example. Hilary Duff can't sing if her life depended on it...she don't even write her own songs...so I'm guessing that if you are not a little teeni-bop music fan you will realise that.Her style is recycled and ""so yesterday""..."
1,poor talentless little girl,"Hilary Duff has become a major household name for pre-teens and little girls. Her show Lizzie McGuire brought her stardom a young girl of her acting abilities should never have recieved. This little pretty girl has had everything handed to her, acting roles, record deals, etc. without the work or talent to back her up. In a way, I say good job Hilary for proving that a person of very average talents (although she is quite the looker) can do very well for herself financially. On the other hand, i think of all the talented people out there who so much more deserve the opportunities this little brat has come to expect and it makes me sick. Do not buy this cd unless you think she is a good actress because if so you don't know enough about talent to know the difference."
1,"Quick, get this girl some singing lessons!","This is about the worst album I've ever listened to. DO NOT BUY THIS CD (I didn't, I just listened to my friend's copy). It will be a huge waste of money because Hilary Duff can't sing to save her life.First of all, all her songs are enhanced by computers or dubbed with many, many background voices. And she STILL sounds terrible! So her voice must have been really, really, really bad before they enhanced it.And most of her songs are completely boring and unintelligible; she sings about love and tween-stuff but it's SO obvious she doesn't know diddly. Half the time, I can barely understand what the hell she's talking about. This CD is sure to drive you insane. If you like Hilary Duff now (WHY?!?!?!), then you'll hate her after listening to this CD.She should stop pretending she knows how to sing, get some voice lessons, and then try again. This CD is truly painful to listen to."
1,A god-awful album,"Curiosity lead me to listen to this girl's album on AOL First Listen, and it was positively horrible. She cannot sing, it is obvious since synthesizers aid her in every song. The lyrics are ridiculous, a third grader could write better material. There is no creativity in any song and after awhile, it becomes so unbearable to listen to that nails on a blackboard sound appealing. Avoid this CD at all cost."
1,Please kill me,"If this is what music has become. How is this even categorized as music? Has the world gone insane? Some people are going as far as to call it rock. Sure its rock, that is, if the sound a rat makes as it's dying is also rock. The future for music looks grim when BS like this is actually sold. This album is a perfect example of the music industry sucking ever dollar out of the public and exploiting us. Come on people, get with it! This is not music! Listen to some Nirvana or Led Zeppelin, now THATS music!"
1,Hilary doesn't even deserve 1 star,"Music was just getting great...until Hilary Duff came into the busisness. Go back to acting, Hilary. You suck ass."
1,"Yes, well there's no more to say","She is utterly unable to sing! Even for those who are attracted to pop music in some form should avoid this C.D. The lyrics are shallow and meaningless. The bubble-gummy fluff of the whole C.D. makes it appealing only for pre-teens, in my opinion. DON'T BUY IT, and if you would like to, at least listen to it first!!"
1,Ummm...,"One word, AWFUL!!!!!!!! Hilary Duff should be thrown in jail for thinking she can sing and act. Too bad she wasn't clapping and singing at the same time then you couldn't hear her singing :)only the flapping of her jubbly arms. She calims she helped write her lyrics, I believe that because her lines are corny like ""If you can't do the math get out of the equasion"".I recomend you highly not to waste money on this so-called number one cd in america (yeah right). Lets try to stop this girl from getting cocky, too late. Metamorphosis is horrible when I listened to it I wished I were deaf."
1,why would anyone buy this ever?,"You guys know she can't sing right? I mean get a myriad of producers and any chick can sound like that. If you ever feel the need to buy or listen to this album or anything remotly like this think instead of slapping yourself in the face, it will hurt less. Save your money and buy music worth listening to ie: Bad Religion Process of Belief, Suicide Machines Match and Some Gasoline or Trapt self title. Words can't describe how awful this and all music in it's genre are."
5,SOOOOO HOT,Hilary Duff is soooooo hot. Haven't really listened to the cd yet but i'm sure its hot too.
1,Cookie Cutter Garbage music.,"Hilary duff hires the Matrix(Avril Lavigne. The result IS this album sounds a lot like Avril Lavignes lets go, only Hilary Duff voice is 10x weaker. Don't get me wrong I don't like never of these artists."
3,Hum de Dum,"In my honest opinion, Hilary Duff was neither good nor bad. Her singing is at an average...I like some of her songs (i.e. 'Come Clean'). Some I don't like, and they get quite annoying after hearing them for some time. Anyway, I had a chance to read this when my older sibling bought a copy of the CD. I was listening to it when she dropped me off at a friend's house. As far as I know, most people think that Hilary Duff is petty and should just stick to acting and all that. I think her career as both a singer and an actor may turn out okay. Her acting would stand out better than her singing, I think. More or less, she's an okay singer, neither the best nor the worst. :)'"
3,Give Her A Break,"Give her a break. Shes not the best, no where near the best, but she is just 16. Sure she doesn't bring true talent like that of other legends who started out young, but she is at least making more money than you. She can sing better than Janet Jackson.Hillary Duff doens't whisper and making you fall asleep like Janet Jackson. Hillary Duff does get annoying with her corny songs but she can at least put out a record that Justin Timberlake couldn't do.First of all, I would like to make this point. I read all of the reviews, and these 1 star raters say these good reviews are from teenyboppers. Sorry, I'm a father, and my daughter owns this CD. I like other music such as Whitney Houston, MICHAEL JACKSON, and Mariah Carey as well as the Temptations.It seems I know these songs now!!! They are played over and over in the car.This album is not great, not bad. Some songs stand out, while some songs just seem like fillers:Best TracksWorkin It OutInner StrengthDo The Math Take a Bath"
1,Painful Experience,I had to babysit a 7 year old girl who put this cd on and i was really frightened by the noises coming out of the stereo. c'mon people what is this world coming to?? please don't tell me that the noises i heard was actually called music. i truly believe that the critters from the quizno's subs commercial have so much more talent. this cd is just really really scary.
5,SPOOKS IS THE BOMB!,AS SOON AS I SAW THE VIDEO ON BET I LOVED THE SONG! I EVEN WENT ANG GOT IT AS SOON AS THE VIDEO WAS OVER. THIS TUNE WOULD PARTICULARLY GET THE ATTENTION OF JAZZ AND HIP-HOP LOVERS.
3,Good but boring,"I have been taking Salsa lessons for about 6 months now. You can say I am an intermediate level, this DVD did not add much to my previous experience in dancing. The instructor was not very amusing and encouraging and as a lady I was looking for more styling on the woman's part. On the other hand the DVD quality is very good although the music in the background was not clear cause the instructor's voice was too noisy, louder than the music it self. The only good part of the DVD is that the steps are explained in a very detailed manner which is good for the people who have never learned the combinations tought in this DVD before. But for me it did not add much to my experience."
5,Salsa. She likes!,"Salsa Crazy DVD is about putting what you've learned in the first two DVDs to use and having fun with it. You'll practice quite a few turns and crossovers and other moves to make Salsa dancing more than a six-count step. Best of all, both men and women can learn what each of them should be doing so they can do it together. It's official. I have learned to Salsa and I like it."
5,go go go for it,I'm a nut about dancing. I try learning different dances and salsa is one of my favorites. I heard about this DVD from people and I ordered my copy ASAP. I had bought other DVD's before but it left me kind off disappointed. Why? There was not enough material and it got too boring in the end. Evan Margolis has great innovative way to teach Salsa. Most instructors make the same simple moves look more difficult and cheesy. The music sucks too! But Evan does it with so much passion and zeal that mesmerizes everyone and makes it look so simple and real. This DVD didn't disappoint me (at all) and I'm glad I have it.
3,Good but not great,"It's a good product overall. If you want a thong to stimulate your behind a bit, this is the one to get. If you want a thong to wear all day, it is NOT the one to get. I've worn it for half a day, that's all. The frontal area is silk, and so is smooth. But the strap (the part that goes around your waist and up your behind) is kind of rough against your skin. That is the reason I can't wear it for long periods of time. But you can wear it for escapades w/ the ladies, or for nights out w/ female friends."
1,silk g string,"much too small, not happy with this purchase. my calvin kliens fit so much better. there is just not enough room in these!"
5,Smells So Good,Yum! A must-have for the man in your life! Smells great and the bottle is very manly too. We love it!
3,It's bottles of compressed gas. What's to know,The gas seems properly restrained and pass gas when appropriate to a dtainless steel bottle and then released stratigically once again. What is not to love.
2,Works for Kenmore Vacuum Cleaners,"The bulb on our vacuum had been dead for some time. Rather than track down a Sears and cough up some $5+, we decided to take a chance on this bulb. It fits perfectly and comes out at half the price - even with shipping! For the curious, we are using it for Kenmore replacement bulb 20-5240.--UPDATE--Although the bulb fit, it burned out within a week of use. Might have been a bad bulb or might just not be designed for the vibrations of brush."
4,It's a bulb,It was cheap and it fit. When we turned the vac on it lit up. I can't say much more than that. Last time I checked it was still working. Someday they will put LED's in instead of bulbs and they will outlast the vac.
4,Let there be light,"Its a light bulb, what else can I say. I expect it will burn out some time. I hope not too soon"
1,Can we call this cheating?,"If you just have QuarkXPress 6 in you computer, I would like to say ""DON'T buy this book, because most of the files included in the CD were created in QuarkXPress Passport. That means you can't open those files from QuarkXPress 6. The book is supposed to be named ""Using QuarkXPress Passport""."
2,Get to the point!,"I had a chance to see Barbara Mandrell in L.A. during the late sixties, but I was not a country music fan. Her cousin (""Little"" Bill Ott) and his sister, Patty, were good friends of mine, as were their father and mother. I wish I had taken them up on their offer to go see Barbara, for the tremendously talented woman I would have met became an icon of country music during the 70s. As far as the book goes, it is chocked full with enough sticky-sweet uncie, daddy, sissie down-home banter, that one could watch ""Hee Haw"" for a year and never hear as many hoaky terms as are included in even the first chapter. Barbara, her husband, her sisters and most of her friends are high-society stars; wealthy beyond belief, and politically ""connected"" in Tennessee and even in Washington. Why she tries so hard to convince the reader that she was EVER so ""Country"", I'll never know. In any case, the book is and worth 7 bucks as a collector's item."
2,Not What I Thought,"I was disappointed with this book. Being a brain injured person, I thought I might learn from Barbara's experiences, but there is very little information about her injury.A better life story of overcoming problems with brain injury isSurviving Black Iceby David Fierce.If you are looking for information about living with brain injury, the best book I've found isBrain Injury Survivor's Guide: Welcome to Our World. It has step-by-step methods used by the author to achieve a successful lifestyle and is easy-to-read."
5,Excellent book!!,I am reading and enjoying this book for the second time! I highly recommend it. The author has a special way of making you feel exactly what she is feeling and taking you along with her. I have never enjoyed a book as much and will be adding this to my gift list for friends.I hope there will be a sequel!
3,Battery Clamp,I Am Not sure what It Is good for Its just like the clamps that come on a small battery charger which do Not have a very strong spring so make sure It Is clamped on the battery good or It will have a bad connection. No I doubt It Is strong enough to hold a wet blanket or a pair of pants for that matter the Pico or Motor Trend 500 Amp clamps are better for that.
3,Beautiful Days Review,The music is the main reason for the reluctant rating of three. I know music can't carry the show but without the music this movie would have gotten a rating of one. The movie had some good scenes but it was hard to follow the story line. The characters didn't seem to connect. The lead actress whom I think is normally very pretty and a believable actress was disappointing and she looked old and tried.
1,Wrong item sent-still no reimbursement,"The book was supposed to be in German; it said German Edition in parenthesis after the title. Instead of notifying me the book was in English, so I could cancel; they shipped it to my daughter anyway at the end of June.The book was returned, per their instructions, on July 19.An e-mail to the company mid-August finally elicited a response asking for a tracking number (not issued with Media rate) since they couldn't find any record of it.Still waiting for a refund."
3,It was ok for a low budget film,"It was an alright movie. It had some suspence that I liked and the acting was good. But it felt as if it was edited, like there were sceens cut out to make it more watcher friendly. I thought it was going to be and it SHOULD HAVE BEEN done more in the likes of ""I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE"". It needed to be a little more gritty and raw. Then it would have felt a little more real and I could have related more emotionally with the characters. But it didn't so I didn't. There you go."
3,Well acted but falls a bit flat,"The performances are the best I can say about this film. I will also add that indeed the title suits it well. You keep wondering when someone will take a shower.Essentially a young abused wife is looking for better circumstances and finds it in a young aristocratic man who finds her as equally desirable for other reasons. She is shadowed continuosly by her husband's so-called best friend, a man she abhors as being the dirty uneducated type she is. Initially interesting but the story languishes into the depressive squalor from which it sprang."
4,Plain Dirty DVD,It was different and great and i was not expecting it to be as good as it was and i really liked it Thanks
3,"Southern obsession, betrayal, and revenge.","[Set in rural Virginia in what appears to be during the 70's (judging by the make of the cars that were used)].Young Inez is married to an abusive, pot growing husband (played by Henry Thomas). She longs to escape from this marriage and be with a wealthy man on the other side town. They are in love and want to be together. She hatches a plan to get rid of him. She seduces her husband's best friend named Flowers to kill her husband, on the condition that Flowers will now be the man in her life.*spoilers ahead.......her husband is found dead by the police..(that is all of the plot I will give away).* recommended viewing for Dominique Swain fans *"
3,Plain Dirty,"Hard to follow, story line jumps all over. Reminds me of the old ""B"" movies. Wouldn't recommend, really did not enjoy this."
2,I was expecting so much more.,Slightly entertaining movie about poor people in the deep south. The main character is attractive and has a nice body but you don't get to see much of it. Decent acting but basically a very boring movie. I wouldn't recommend it.
1,Big Mistake....,"I gotta say this movie is an example of a terrible idea, Swain husband beats the crap outta her and she spends her time running from him. What's worse his friend is a lunatic who want swain's character. Swain's Character is a hillbilly who like's an upper class doctor who she really never connects with, I never really got why Swain settled for a lunatic when she was trying to find inner peace thru the whole movie. This movie puts a bad taste in my mouth, it was a waste of my time it wasnt a story it was an excuse to make a bad movie. (Do not buy)"
5,"Practice, Practice and you'll pass the first time.","Because of the many multiple choice questions and catagories of this review book; all subject matters and possible test questions are covered throughly. By repetatively performing the various test and reviewing the answers I got wrong, I felt well prepared for the certification test."
3,"Acceptable, but not great","My daughter really wanted this radio, even though there were no reviews of it, and some similarly priced CD/Radios had pretty good reviews. The worst thing is that the clock has no light. The clock also runs on a AA battery, even if it is plugged in. It doesn't have a low battery indicator, so someday the alarm just won't go off, I guess. The CD doesn't work as the alarm - only the radio or beeper. The sound quality is OK, but is not as full sounding as a similar Emerson clock radio that we have. The speakers are in the lid. It sounds better with the lid open, but works with it closed. My daughter just wanted the radio and CD player, and she's very satisfied with this."
5,awsome single,"the live songs are from the first tour after self titled was released, their live preformances are better now. ANy way it's still good. Johny is a b side in the comical style of bounce. Not anything like as good as n e thing on toxcicity. Also if u want a good song by system not on a album check out the dracula 2000 soundtrack where they have metro (my fave system song) and N.I.B 2 tribute 2 black sabbath where they cover snowblind."
5,Wonderful!,"This new CD is an absolute delight.... tasty from beginning to end. Laura's trio delivers on every cut, and her piano solos just make you smile. Highly recommended!"
4,Only one Child can realistically Play with this,"I bought this for my three kids as a ""surprise"" toy on random day. They instantly loved it, however, almost all the patterns require you to use all the available blocks, so they of course were fighting over who would get which block. Working together as a team on this toy isn't all that fun. The blocks themselves are made from a nice thick wood and the pattern boards are a heavy weight cardboard. Overall, I am happy with this purchase, but if you have more than one kid, you should get additional blocks (which I am not sure if they sell them separately or not) OR just buy a whole other set."
3,Parquerty Block Set ... Plus and Minus,This Parquetry Set is being used to aid brain injured patients understand and develop pattern concepts. The set would be physically much easier to use if the pattern sheets were contained within a frame which would prevent the blocks from moving during assembly.
4,so well written and so clever.,Still reading this book. It makes you look at yourself and the world in a different way. Opens your mind up to new perspectives. written with humor and wit.
4,important questions with important answers,"At once humorous and deeply philosophical, Walker Percy's Lost in the Cosmos is a refreshing change from the hectic pace of the modern world. He presents amusing (because they are so plausible) scenarios which make the reader think about the questions that we, busy with work, family, friends and other activities almost never take the time to consider. Who am I? Why am I here? What is the nature of my relationship to other people and to the universe? Finding out the answers to these questions for oneself may be the most important thing anyone ever does - but don't expect the answers to be in the book!Do read the book, though, and try to figure out what you think the answers are. It might be important."
1,I don't get it,"Walker Percy was an author who came highly recommended to me, so I chose ""Lost in the Cosmos"" as my first Percy book. Maybe it was the wrong choice, but I found nothing herein to recommend any further reading. Well, nothing is maybe a stretch. There was some interesting dialogue analyzing the rewards of creation between scientists and artists. At one point in the book, Percy states the following forty pages can be skipped. I can picture him laughing at readers who didn't follow his advice, because these pages are nothing more than gobble-de-gook: Unreadable and not at all understandable. The subtitle of this book is ""The Last Self-Help Book."" I guess this comes from the two places in the book where he highly recommends suicide. Not a book to be read by someone suffering from depression. Or by anyone else as far as I can see. I'm crossing Mr. Percy off my must-read list."
4,"a wacky, riveting book","Walker Percy asks all the right questions in a unique way. He describes transcendence be it through art, science or God, and gives a brief rundown on his theory of sign and language or ""semiotics""."
1,Couldn't finish it,"I think I just don't have the right personality for this style of writing. I found the tone sarcastic and pedantic, and although some of his insights were amusing in the end it just got tedious for me and I lost interest. To each his own."
1,Questions,"It said ""self help"". What help is a book full of questions - with no answers? I couldn't understand it. The questions are ambiguous and stupid. It must be a joke that I didn't get. I tried to read it and understand what the point of it is, but it was beyond me. Then he makes up conversations between fictitious people that didn't seem to go anywhere, & then he asks another question. I didn't get it. I don't normally read 1 star criticues, but for this book I needed to do that because I agree with all of them. This was not a book for me!"
1,I was indeed lost...,"Despite giving this book all of my attention, I found it terribly frustrating. I initially couldn't decide if it was supposed to be some type of dark humor or ""dark matter"", but then I was completely lost by the chapters in which the author attempted to shed some light on the foundation of his field of study. I'm still lost in the dark. It was recommended by an astrophysicist on PBS, but I guess you have to be one of that rare breed to appreciate it. I bailed out at about 40% with little hope that it would improve. The explanation of semiotics left me semi-comatose."
3,DATED,"TRIED TO READ IT AND FOUND SOME INTERESTING THINGS, BUT IT WAS DATED AND SOMETHINGS MADE NO SENSE. TAKE IT IR LEAVE IT."
3,Huh?,"I was forced to read this in Philosophy. That took away the expericance for me. It is an interesting read, and asks questions in a Socratic way that is appealing to the reader. But some of the inside jokes/references are a little dated for me as an undergrad and probally appeal to those 5-10 years older than me."
2,PHI-101 droning,"A wittily written but repetitive analysis of the strange workings of the human mind, in the tongue-in-cheek guise of a comically long-winded multiple-choice personality quiz. Though the insights are dead-on with regard to the oddities of human behavior, particularly our schadenfreudenous nature, it's nothing one doesn't already know -- though I suppose the point is to demonstrate it's not just an anomaly with the individual but a universal series of character failings. However comforting (or discomforting) that may be, it soon takes an onanistic PHI-101 quality. It's a book that loves to hear itself talk."
5,Awsome,"Just purchased the KE-42SX910 Plasma. I waited a while to purchase a plasma tv until the prices came down a little but this one seemes worth the wait.The picture is very sharp on a Dish Network satellite broadcast signal-there is slight degradation of the picture when run through a Pioneer combo Tivo-DVD burner but still acceptable.Needless to say the DVD's are spectacular. Sound is excellent without any additional speakers, and aesthetically, the TV is like having a beautiful piece of furniture.All in all, a great plasma television that you should be able to get for between [$$$]."
5,GREAT COAT,"FINALLY I found a raincoat that fit my long Lab's length, and at a very decent price. The first one I had for him, a different brand in an XL, didn't cover all his back and none of his tail, and the neck was so tight I had to cut it. The neck on this one fits perfectly, and the coat protects him nicely, especially since he doesn't object to the hood. He's a hard fit: 74 lbs Lab mix, way long, but relatively small girth. Even with velcro, the straps around his tummy hang loose. I ordered an XXL because of his unusual length, but he really should have an XL. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again. It is well-made, and is absolutely essential in this climate. People think it's cute or funny--I've had people stop to take a picture with their phones--but I bought it because I don't want a wet dog. Also, idk why, but he loves to wear it -- he sort of ""prances"" when he's got it on LOL."
4,extra extra large dog rain coat,"I had to air it out for 3 wks. to remove the oder as it smelled of stail gas or diesel fuel, & my 120 lb. bloodhound has a keen nose. He liked it after it aired out and keeped him dry"
3,Review,"This product works to keep the rain from soaking the heavy coat of my standard poodle. I had to modify the strap that goes under his chest because it was too long. I had it cut off and the Velcro repositioned. My dog is only 48 pounds, lean, but long. So I purchased an XXL to fit his length. Also the ties that hold the hood down are not effective. The rubber ends came off immediately, and the ties (string) are a pain to use. Should have a strap or some other way of holding the hood in place.However, the coat seems to be made well, and holds in place with the chest strap and two stretch bands for the back legs. Not sure how long these bands will last.I would recommend this rain coat, heeding to the caveat I mentioned."
3,"Great jacket, terrible smell","His jacket is great, heavy duty, the hood is a bit small for the overall size of the jacket though. The jacket I ordered was XXL yet the hood barely stretches over my dogs head. The only real negative about this jacket is the smell, it's terrible.. smells like petroleum, plastic, gross. I can't even keep it in my house, so I'm trying to air it in the garage. Overall great product, maybe a wash in the machine might make it smell less."
5,amazing!,This is the best thing since sliced bread! It fits my 75 pound husky from head to tail its even a little big to really cover him! Its so hard to find clothing for large dogs. This is perfect! And he loves it too!
5,Good value,"For the price, this dog rain coat is a great buy. I have a long basset hound and it fits lengthwise. It does hang on the ground and makes him look like a sunnyside-up egg, but that's not the coat's fault. It's easy to put on and is sturdy."
3,They didn't like it,"I like it, good product for the price. Trouble is, my 2 Golden Retrievers did not like it, they started fighting and pull it out from each other...."
3,smells like new tires,"We have a cane corso so i thought i need a XXL but its toooo big, but i can make it work. The rain jacket stinks really bad like new tires and it smells very toxic so i had it out for days and it still smells but not as bad. Except the smell i have no other complaints."
4,Love it..it is perfect except for one thing...........,It is the cutest look on our Golden Doodle! It really keeps her dry and she loves putting it on! Now no more blow drying her which I had to do each time she got wet from the rain. One complaint though....the hood is too small for her head! i was very disappointed....she is large due to her breeding (Golden Retriever and Poodle mix). She is 69 lbs and the XX size fits her body great....just not the hood! Just an FYI to anyone with a large breed dog.
1,"Came from ""one way pets"" not Amazon, poor","Perfect rain coat for our dog.We ordered another one too. Because Amazon's vender ""ONE WAY PETS"" only works one way, their way.When we received the coat it was the size of a tent on him. Went to Amazon site to exchange to a smaller size. Well it seems One Way Pets exchanges don't happen it's one way, THEIR way.Only if they receive it back by yesterday's date I could get a refund. Like I said NO SIZE EXCHANGES either. I have not been so mad with a vendor, I got scammed.From amazon I ordered one size down and the product comes from Amazon direct, I know the ordering service thru amazon has always been above and beyond. Not the case from their vendor ONE WAY PETS.Like I said, we love the product and paid again to receive the perfect rain coat for our Lab.If anyone wants a oversized raincoat that I ordered and am stuck with I will give it to you.Joe Goni Fernley Nevada USA"
2,Dog Rain coat,The size was Big where i have to sew it and the garter for the back legs was kinda of annoying it bothers my Dog whenever she has to squat to make her business.
3,Perfectly functional & TOTALLY useless,"How is that title possible you ask?I bought the XL size for my German Shepherd... just a little too small so I ordered the XXL.Same item.Same brand.Just different size.And it stinks.To high heaven.As soon as I opened the box Management ordered it out of the house. It has now been airing out under the house for SIX weeks and it still smells very strong. If it's that strong to me, how can I put it on a creature that reportedly has a sense of smell 400 times better than mine?And it's not yellow, as the XL was, it's orange which wouldn't matter at all except the color and the smell together suggest a different material or manufacturer or.....??So it ought to get 2.5 stars... 5 because it's perfectly functional, but zero because you can't use it."
4,guardian dog rain jacket XXL,"This rain jacket works great. I have a large hairy dog, the coat fits well, stays in place and keeps him dry. It's easy to put on/take off and my dog seems to like it. I wish the hood was larger so it would stay on his head but that is a minor complaint."
2,*sigh*,"In order to get a size that covered my dog's back, went a size up. Though the velcro strap is WAY too long, and the back is so long I have to fold it over for him not to poop on it, the head opening is barely large enough to get over his head. If I had gone one size down, it wouldn't have fit over his head, and I think his hiney would get wet. Thank goodness it wasn't more expensive."
4,Stylin' Dog!,"Great rain coat after we hung it outside for about 3 weeks to get rid of the PVC smell! The hood is a little tight on the neck because our dog is a collie and has all that mane, but overall it fits well."
2,Falling Apart,"My boyfriend bought me this ring for my birthday and I thought it was beautiful. Wore it the next day to work and noticed one of the pearls had fallen out. We notified the seller, who promptly sent us an envelope to send it back for another one. Thought everything was fine, but just the other day I saw another pearl was missing. So the first ring didn't last a day and the second lasted about a month before a pearl fell out. It's an absolutely beautiful ring, but I'm not sure it's worth the effort to keep sending back for a new one."
4,Nice ring,"This is a nice ring, and it was shipped promptly. The ring arrived loose in the ring box, but was undamaged. Also, it is quite dainty. The picture on the page makes it look larger, so please be aware that it is greatly enlarged to show detail. I still like the ring, and I'm happy with it."
3,Pearl fell out.,"I think this ring is beautiful, but I had a pearl fall out about 2 weeks into wearing it. It lays flat and doesn't get in the way."
5,Great value from a wonderful company,"I ordered this 28 piece Johnson Brothers/Franciscan dinnerware set from Barron's through Amazon. When I received it in the mail it was securely wrapped up and everything was safe inside. And shipment was fast. A few weeks later, I received a hand-written note from Barron's thanking me for the purchase! Great customer service!"
5,Python is going to make history,"This amazing new artist is talented and versatile. I have seen him perform, and this single CD lives up to the live excitement that only Python could deliver."
1,Not flat on bottom,The pan says it's compatible with glass cooktops. It is not since it has ridges on the outside bottom of the pan. Pans for glass cooktops should be smooth on the bottom. It looks like a nice pan for regular gas or electric burners. Don't order if you have the glass cooktop.
2,Too Small,"These bowls are actually a lot smaller than they look. I ordered the set of six, thinking that I would be able to use them as cereal bowls or soup bowls. To me, they are better suited as dessert bowls."
3,Otherworldly Animation,"Now ""Pet Alien"" is one twisted, freaked-out series. It's about an average young boy named Tommy Cadle who lives in a lighthouse when suddenly his life has changed when a raucous band of aliens pay a visit. The aliens consist of Dinko(a little green alien who is Tommy's best friend), Gumpers(a big, pink lunkheaded alien), Swanky(a tall, suave blue alien who is rather left alone), Flip(a bird-like alien who speaks his own language), and Scruffy(an alien dog with a tongue for miles).The animation is basically 3-D, with a few 2-D effects(i.e. whacks and smoke clouds). But still, it's a really weird series if weirdness is your thing.The DVD has only four episodes with not very many features, which is better than no episodes at all. They include ""The Thing on the Corner"", where Dinko is concerned about a mailbox, and ""Stage Fright"" where the aliens help Tommy audition for a play.So if this series doesn't appease your taste in toons, try another."
5,"What,Hulk Accused Of murder ?!","Of Guilt, Models and MurderWhat,Hulk Accused Of murder ?! say it isn't so,it is in this episode that has guest stars Loni Anderson [jennifer,WKRP in cincinnati] Jeremy Brett [Sherlock,the british television series]. In this episode the good Dr. Banner [Bill Bixby]find himself [yet again] in another location where this time a young woman has been murdered ! Good episode Great price....buy it !"
5,The Incredible Hulk rules!!!!,"I loved The Incredible Hulk when I was a kid, and was excited when I found out that the entire first season was available. I have watched the first season, and cannot wait for the entire second season to become available."
3,The Incredible Hulk-Season 1,"The pilot episode and the entire collection of episodes brought back a lot of memories, especially with the opening credits."
3,"This is the 1988 movie, not the 1977 movie.","I ordered this and there seems to be some alternate titling going on here. The film I was sent is the 1988 film with Thor, titled ""The Return of the Incredible Hulk,"" although IMDB lists it as ""The Incredible Hulk Returns."" This item's description says it's the 1977 version, also listed on IMDB as ""The Return of the Incredible Hulk"" or ""Death in the Family."" Just a word of warning to avoid confusion. The DVD arrived in good condition, so no complaints there, but the seller needs to update the description to show the proper year of release."
4,HULKing Out,"Other than the Magician, The Courtship of Eddie's Father (Both which are unavailable on DVD yet) and My Favorite Martian, The late Bill Bixby's legacy will be playing Dr Banner on the Incredible Hulk. As Banner, he showcased the human side of a monster. Banner-A fugitive from the law searching for a cure to his condition, make you see that man on the run, still had the milk of human kindness.Crated by Kenneth Johnston, who created such TV shows as V and Alien Nation, The Hulk took the Marvel comic to a new level. This Jekyll and Hyde story to a new height....and gave it a beating heartSomeone may ask why this DVD set only 4 stars....Well the first season seem weaker story lines than in did in future seasons..but with Bixby and Johnston working together on these two pilot films and 10 episodes, these tv spisodes were good TVBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
2,"Well, at least they released it","As a fan of the Hulk I can say this DVD release is a bit of a disappointment. Sure the show deserves 5 stars, but YES, we have to review what Universal gave us. People already love the show so they do not need a review of it, they need to know if this set is worth buying. The packaging is nice but the extras are a waste of space. The commentary is from the previous release and WHY release an episode of season 2 when they should just put it on the season 2 release? The video quality is grainy as if Universal decided to record this directly from VHS. Even Leave It To Beaver which dates The Hulk by about 30 years has better video quality.The photo on the back of Bixby is NOT from the series, but ""Death Of The Hulk"" movie. Why is it on the box?If you are a fan of The Hulk, then this is a must-have but Universal should have put a little more time into it by re-mastering the video and maybe adding commentary from Lou. And where was that gag reel?!?"
3,Incredible Hulk Returns,I must agree with the others. It was a good reunion film for the cast but it will only be repected by the fans. FYI - Columbia House is offering the original Incredible Hulk episodes on DVD. Great for the fans.
3,Good to hear again,"I once owned an original copy of ""Hey Schoolgirl/Dancin wild."" It became far too scratched up to play. ""Hey Schoolgirl"" is truly an excellent emulation of the Everly Brothers. I always thought it shoud have been a bigger hit than it was. Travis & Bob also had the Everly sound on the top ten hit ""Tell Him No."" I did not consider Travis & Bob and their one big hit as good as Tom & Jerry. ""Our song"" and Dancin Wild"" are just OK in their Everly sound. ""Hey Schoolgirl"" displayed real talent.The solos on this album are OK. I was very happy when they became reunited as Simon & Garfunkel and recorded such truly exceptional music."
4,Gotta have it,"We have had this burglar for 2 months now, it is so cute to see my boxer who is 9 months old chew and drag him around the house. He just managed to ripe off half an arm but the rest is still together. It preety good."
3,The Dean of Country music deserves bettter than this!,"I bought this because there are so few recordings of Eddie Dean available. Dean was an excellent singer if a little overly dramatic. However this collection does not serve him well. The sound is not great and is poor on someof the earlier songs.I recommend it only to those like myself who want it to complete collections of ""cowboy"" music."
5,Low tech but terrific,"Wonderful look at post-WW2 attitudes and images. No doubt the Nazi Welles is evil and the Nazi hunter Robinson needs to capture him. Good must triumph, but in this film, it's not that easy. I liked all the period details of the small New England town in 1946 and of course Weles, Robinson, and Loretta Young were great and fun to watch. If you want to get away from the Bond And Bourne pyrotechnics and dead bodies everywhere, you will like this film"
2,A letdown,"Even though the description for this disc says that the video for ""Let's Make Love"" is included, it isn't; instead, the 9th track is ""Angel Boy."" If I'd known that, I probably wouldn't have bought it. The selection of other videos is weak and inconsistent. This is NOT the best of Tim, by a long shot, but since the disc is manufacturerd by Curb Records, my guess is that Tim didn't have much of anything to do with it. (If I remember correctly, he had a disagreement with Curb about releasing the Greatest Hits CD, on which this DVD is based, without his approval a year or so ago.)"
2,A little dissapointed!!,"I am a big fan of Tim's But I was dissapointed in this DVD. Iexpected more of his videos and special features that you get onother DVDs but got only 9 videos, what a let down.I hope CurbRecords puts out another one with rest of his hits for all of hisdissapointed fans."
3,"Great Country singer....great songs, but missing more hits..","Tim McGraw is a great singer in Country music! He has ruled the charts with the modern(progressive)Country sound that Garth Brooks first incorporated in his music, in 1989. Although I enjoy all the hits that McGraw has earned, I am disappointed with this DVD video collection. It is missing my favorite song/video: Everywhere....it's also missing Not A Moment Too Soon, Refried Dreams and Just To Hear You Say That You Love Me(with his beautiful wife, Faith Hill). I wish that Curb Records would have put out a more complete Tim McGraw video collection for his fans to thoroughly enjoy, like myself!"
4,"Some Great Videos Included, But Some Are Missing","I enjoyed this collection of music videos, they included some of Tim McGraw's best on this DVD. However, many of his videos are not included here. It would be even better if it were a collection of his videos from the very beginning of his career, all the way up to the present.The ones that are included are great though, and it's nice to be able to watch them whenever you want. Hopefully in the future we will see a more complete collection of his music videos."
3,not that great,"I am a huge Tim and Faith fan, and I was a little dissapointed by the selection of videos this DVD has. The only video with Faith is the It's your love video(It doesn't have the Let's Make Love video) and she only sings a couple of words solo. It's an okay DVD overall, but for 20 dollars I expected a lot better videos. The first video is Indian Outlaw, which I thought was a terrible song. The other bad thing about it is that there are only a few videos, and no commentaries! Tim doesn't speak at all, and there are really no ""special features"" besides subtitles. If I had to rate this DVD overall from a scale of 1-10, I would probably give it a 7."
3,A bit more flashy than picture suggests,"I bought this watch as a gift and ended up returning it. The watch itself was fine (the matte gray face is particularly handsome), but the gold hour-markers (at the 12, 3, 6, and 9) on the face are much more shiny in person than they look in the picture, kind of like little diamond studs. The intended recipient (who is not a ""jewelry person"") preferred something a bit less flashy."
4,Good but too small for man,This is a good watch. But it is too small for man. I hope it is little bigger. I like the thin profile. Good price.
1,I don't know why they called it a sketchbook.,"Poorly designed and conceived this book does a disservice to the legendary comic book artist.Severely lacking, It reads and looks like a ""fanzine."" It's all black and white which would have been ok, but the book confines what little art there is into the small comic-book trade paperback size, giving the book a very claustraphobic look.For a hardcore fan it was a pleasant, light read, but as a ""sketchbook"" it is really disappointing. John Romita deserves a much more professional tribute."
1,Primitive superstition in the 24th century,This episode was boring and stupid.Gene Roddenberry died towards the beginning of airing season 5. In Season 6 you can start to notice that.In Season 6 I've noticed at least a few episodes having some religious tone to them and you will notice it throughout this entire episode.If Gene was alive at the time he would not allow this type of writing for Star Trek.Gene clearly did not like religion and was basically an Atheist.This episode gives a pro-religion and pro-faith message and Gene did not want that for Star Trek.It was ridiculous and absurd at the end where Data has a discussion with Worf about spirituality and leap of faith.Not exactly a conversation you would expect from an android in the 24th century. More like an ignorant man from the 20th century or prior.
5,Medical terminology book,This is a great book for learning medical terminology. It takes each word suffix and prefix and builds on the learning of each with easy self guided tests and practical use through repetition. Easy to learn and retain the words.
1,WTF,"I have no idea what was sent to me, it has the cover, it has print, but it looks like it was photocopied and bound. That's it terrible attempt at a book."
1,If I could give this zero stars I would.,Item described and pictured is NOT the item received. Buyer beware. Do not order from this company. They can't get anything right.
2,diasppointing,I had looked forward tp reading this book but overall found it self-centered and disappointing. I could not recommend it.
3,Not for beginner,I have two different Haynes manuals for two different cars. Both are similar for their repair instructions. THEY JUST AREN'T DETAILED ENOUGH TO GET A JOB DONE! Haynes and Chilton repair manuals both just assume too much. They assume you know the basics when taking stuff apart that they sometimes forget to cover a simple instruction that could make you break something. An example for this taking the glove box out to repair the cabin/ac air filters. They didn't cover and show pictures of every single screw to take off and how to take the glove box out in the end. I had to follow a forum's instruction for my Honda. I don't know if I would buy another Haynes manual again in the future when I get a new car. It's better to pay more for a factory manual than to follow Haynes or Chilton and break something.These are good for those that know the basics or mechanics. It's just not for the beginner who needs step by step.
5,Excellent book. It goes into great details.,Excellent book. It goes into great details. Sometimes it goes into too much of unnecessary details. Great value for the book. I recommend it for someone who is a begginer or intermediate. Its easy to read with pictures. It tells me when i need to service the car and everything. Great value for the book.
4,Great Book,"Great Book with pictures and instructions step by step, these books are great for the Do it yourself guy that wants to know how to do it, and maybe save a few dollars ....."
5,High interest book on meat eating plants,"High interest topics are covered in the Eye View series and this one is no exception. The meat-eating plants covered are the pitcher plant, venus's flytrap, cobra lily, sun pitcher, albany pitcher, monkey cup, sundew, butterwort, and bladderwort. Did you know that monkeys have actually been seen using the monkey cup plant as a cup? The photographs are excellent, but it is a little disconcerting to see the book's cartoon child guide inside the traps of the meat eating plants. Karen Woodworth-Roman, Children's Science Book Review"
4,Five Fan,"I love Five, and this CD rocks! Me and my friends did a dance to Slam Dunk it and pretty much everyone like it cause the music was so intergetic. The songs on this CD are all cool. I have the first CD. Great. Oh, this message is from a girl."
3,Cool Book,"I recommend The Whipping Boy. This book was written by Sid Fleischman and received the 1987 John Newberry Medal award.The story is about an orphan,Jemmy who is taken to a palace to be a ""Whipping Boy"". A whipping boy is a child who gets whipped in place of the prince in the palace. The prince happens to be a spoiled rotten brat and is known throughout the country as ""Prince Brat"". I really don't have to say this but the poor whipping boy gets wipped a lot because the Prince gets in trouble a lot. I would recomend this book to anyone. It is a great book an I enjoyed it very much."
3,It was good it just had to much hard words like considerable,It was good. the best part was when they went to the fair and the soldier came looking for them and when they got kidnapped.But the only two things bad about it was that they stayed kidnapped too long and it had way to much hard word like swarming.
3,Two boys escape the castle and travel in the real world.,"A short book for juveniles about a prince who is a brat and his whipping boy (the boy who gets whipped whenever the prince does something wrong). The two boys travel to the world outside of the castle. However, the whipping boy discovers that he has been accused of the ""kidnapping"" of the royal heir. The two have a number of adventures in which the whipping boy inadvertantly teaches the prince how to behave. The book won the 1987 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature. According to the information supplied, this book is recommended to be read by children up to the age of 12 (that is, sixth grade). Well, at the sixth grade at a local school, the students were reading Buck's ""The Good Earth"" and Steinbeck's ""The Pearl""! I suspect that sixth graders would get more out of Twain's ""The Prince and the Pauper"" than out of ""The Whipping Boy."" I would recommend the book for younger age groups."
2,Jemmy and Prince Brat help each other run from evil vilans,Jemmy and Prince Brat runs away from the castle and gets kidnapped from two evil villans named Cutwater and Hold your noes Billy. Jemmy and prince Brat makes a plan to switch places. Jemmy and the prince meets people who help them out on there journey back to the castle.
2,The book is about friendship.,"It is about a whipping boy named Jemmy. Jemmy gets whipped all the time. Prince Brat helps him get out of the castle, but they get kidnapped. I would recommend this book because you learn about friendship."
3,Fleischman Whips Up a Good Book,"How would you feel if you had to be whipped all the time, because of a troublesome Prince? You would try and run away, right? That's what little Jemmy tried to do. The Whipping Boy is not a good book for kids eight and under, because it's a little difficult to understand. It is a good book for older kids though, because it's a challenge to read. The Whipping Boy is about a Prince who always gets his whipping boy into trouble. The whipping boy runs away, because he hates being whipped all the time for things he doesn't do. The Prince also runs away, because he doesn't like being royalty. While in the woods, the two bump into each other. They decide to stick together so they won't get lost. Later, they bump into some nasty pirates who try to kill them. Will either of them survive? Read The Whipping Boy to find out."
5,IT WAS A PAGETURNER!!!,"I loved the whipping boy, I had to read it in liturature circles and now it's my absolute favorite book."
1,A book that didn't deserve a Newbery,I read this book when I was in second grade and I hated it. I re-read it the other day and I still hated it. That just goes to show it doesn't improve over time. There were lots of other good books made in 1987 that could have won besides this book.
2,The Whipping Boy,"In this book Prince Brat is a boy who cannot write or read. Jemmy is the whipping boy who gets the whippings when Prince Brat is misbehaving. Jemmy, who is also called Jemmy of the streets, is given this name by the father of Prince Brat. Prince Brat's father also gives him clothes and plenty of food, and a good home. One day Jemmy plans to run away. When Prince Brat finds out he asks to join him. So then they ran away but end up being held for ransom. I think this book needs a little reality. It is perfect for younger children (like 3-5th grades.) I thought it was not very good because it did not make sense. It needed more details on the characters and the setting. It did not hold my attention and I think it could have been better, and that's why I rate it two stars."
1,te whipping boy,"I read a book called The Whipping Boy. It was not very good.This story is about a prince who has a few problems. He is always gets in to trouble. Since the prince can never get hit, they have a whipping boy to get hit for him. The whipping boy gets hit about three to four times a day. The whipping boy's name is Jemmy. The prince's name is Brat. Jemmy and Prince Brat run away and get into a lot of trouble.It was vary confusing and hard to keep up with. My mind was drifting around. I would give this book a 1 out of 5 because it was not very good. It was kind of stupid.The only way you would be able to like this book is if you like stupid books. I would not recommend this book to anyone. It seems like a good book from the cover. The first few chapters are good. But then it gets really boring. After every chapter it got really confusing."
3,A book about people's differences.,"I just finished reading the Whipping Boy by Sid Fleischman.Man,it really makes you think.It's about two boys,one is rich and the other is poor.They even get kidnapped!The worst thing is they can't accept eachother's differences.I can't tell you anymore about it,you'll have to check it out on your own.It's a great book for people who love action.There is only one thing that I don't like about it and that is the setting.I don't enjoy settings from the past.That is what I have to say about the Whipping Boy."
3,A book about worst enemies turning into friends.,The Whipping Boy by Sid Fleischman is a good book. Its's about a spoiled prince and his whipping boy Jemmy. They run away from the castle. While they are running they go from worst enemies to best friends. This book is for 2nd grade to whatever.

3,A book about gaining trust and changing.,"Hi! I read ""The Whipping Boy"" by Sid Fleishman. This book is very interesting because of how the characters have adventures. On a scale from 1 to 5 I would give it a 3. This is about a prince that nobody likes and how he doesn't have any friends. Well that's all I'm going to tell youread it to find out more about ""The Whipping Boy!"""
3,a book on gaining friendship & trust,"I read the book ""The Whipping Boy"" by Sid Fleischman. This book is a wonderful book about Jemmy,a boy taken from his home in the sewers to be Prince Brats's whipping boy,and they go on many adventures ,but now its's your turn to read and find out what happens1 Have fun!"
4,This book is about a royal whipping boy and a bratty prince.,"Hi! I read a book called "" The Whipping Boy "" by Sid Flieschman. The book was about a boy named Jemmy who gets captured from the streets and turns into Prince Brat's whipping boy. Prince Brat real name is Prince Horace but everyone knows he is a brat. Well, one day...Hold on! I'm not going to tell you the rest you will have to find out yourself by reading this book."
3,Kidnappers! Bears! & Rats!,"I just finished reading a book, The Whipping Boy, written bySid Fleischman. I think this was a very good book. It had lots of action. The story started when the young prince decided to run away and took his whipping boy with him. Together, they had a lot of excitement and many adventures. They met a dancing bear called Petunia. They got kidnapped by two cutthroats, Hold-your-nose Billy and Cutwater. I would recommend this book to any kid who likes to read and likes books with lots of action.Logan---Piqua Jr. HighPiqua, Ohio"
3,A story about two boys who run away and get into trouble.,"I read the book "" The Whipping Boy"" by Sid Fleishman. It is a story about two boys and they run away and they meet new friends, have adventures, meet rivals, and alot more! Whoops! I can't tell you any more so read it for yourself!"
4,This book is great and I encourage you to read it.,"I rate this book a **** because, they use exelent description,the story is very humorous,and the suspence is great! At some points there were so many characters,that the story got very confusing. I think the end of the story is great, because it leaves you thinking about what could happen next. This book is about a boy named jemmy, who is a royal whipping boy at the castle and a really snobby prince, wich everyone calls him prince brat behind his back.They run away and heeeeeeeeelp!Ooooooooooops I can't tell you any more you have to read the book to find out what happens next. to find out what happens next."
2,The book is about a prince and a whipping boys that ranaway.,The Whippinng Boy is By: Sid Fleischman. The book was about two boys that ranaway from home. Jemmy is the prince's whipping boy because no one can whip his son. The prince got so mad at his father so he runs away from home and takes the whipping boy with him. If you want to find out what kind of places they go and the people they meet you will have to read the book. I didn't like the book because I couldn't relate to the characters and it's not really the kind of book I enjoy reading.
2,A book about making friends.,Hi! I read a book called The Whipping Boy by Sid Fleischman. This book is about a boy named Prince Brat. Prince Brat lives in a castle and has a whipping boy whose name is Jemmy. Something happens to them but I guess you will have to read the book to find out what. I did not like this book at all but that is my opinion not yours.
2,For children under 10 only!,"Considering how simple and unsophisticated this book is, I'm SHOCKED that it won the prestigious Newbery Award. It lacks the usual depth that seems to be a criteria for the award. That said, I think that children under 10 years old would enjoy the story. If you're older, you'll be bored to death. A semi-interesting ""adventure"" (using the term loosely) between two boys from different worlds, one a prince, the other his whipping boy, is hardly fodder for the imagination. Try ""A Wrinkle in Time""...you'll be more satisfied."
2,5C,"The book The Whipping Boy was very adventurous. But, I did not like it that well. I would give it a two out of five. Vocabulary of the book was a little hard, but I got it. The pace I did not like very well because it was slow, and with that hard vocabulary, it made it even slower. Understanding the story was a little tough because every chapter changed.Prince Brat got a new whipping boy. One day they went to town. That's when Cutwater and Hold-Your-Nose-Billy kidnapped them. Jemmy (whipping boy) and Prince Brat got away and found a girl named Betsy. They lived with her for awhile. They decided to go back home because they got tired of the woods."
4,A book that says that royalty and money isn't everything.,"A reader from L.A., Greenville, S.C. Hi, I read a book called The Wipping Boy by Sid Fleishman. It is about two boys, one of royal blood named Prince Horace (commenly known as prince Brat), and one from the streets named Jemmy. Jemmy is Prince Brat's wipping boy. Jemmy hated Prince Brat Through the story the two boys run away and get caught by two Kidnappers one named Hold your nose Billy and the other was Cutwater. The two boys have two dodge many conflicts with the kidnappers and at the same time gain trust in each other. I recomend this book to kids who like adventures. I have read this book three times and every time it is as exciting as the last."
4,The Whipping Boy by Trin,"The Whipping Boy is about a prince known as Prince Brat,and a whipping boy who never cries or whimpers when he is being whiped. Whenever the prince gets in troble the whipping boy get whipped,and the prince never gets whipped. When the prince wants to run away and never come back to his palace he takes Jimmy the whipping boy with him just in case. Jimmy leads the prince to the woods. When they are in the woods they run into trouble. I liked this book because it was a long adventure,also because it has a lot of action in it."
3,The story is about Jemmy which is a whipping boy.,I chose 3 stars cause it was sort of easy for a 6th grader. But I could under stand it and it was a wounderful book. So I tryed to put my stars in the middle. I recomend this book to a 2nd grader.
4,A really good book,This book certainly deserved the Newberry Medal. Its a good and interesting story. One that is harsh at first but has a moral in the end.
4,"This is a really, really, really, really good book","The Whipping Boy was written by Sid Fleischman. It is a Newberry Medal winner about a prince named Prince Horace, also know as Prince Brat. When he gets in trouble a boy named Jemmy gets whipped instead of him. Jemmy is the whipping boy. One night Prince Horace and Jemmy decide to run away and meet two kidnappers named Cutwater and Hold-Your-Nose-Billy. This an excellent book. What do you think Jemmy and Prince Horace will do next?"
3,The whipping boy,There was a young prince who lived in a castle with his father.Prince Brate had a whipping boy. The whipping boys name is jemmy. He gets whipped when prince brate dose something bad. Read this story it is relley good.
3,We used this as part of a study of the Middle Ages,My 9 year old son liked it but I would have preferred something with a little more discription of the time period. The characters weren't very well developed and the book was difficult to read aloud smoothly. I probably won't use it again for Medieval History.
5,"Charming, Delightful, Entertaining, Informative",I loved this book so much! Since I have moved from Pennsylvania to Australia I have missed squirrels very much. They are such beautiful and resourceful creatures yet we seem to know so little about them. Grace's story of her experiences with her neighbourhood squirrels will delight any animal lover. She has a unique perspective and writing style which is intelligent yet appreciative of the little critters. I really loved her wonderful accounts of which squirrels prefer which nuts and how they choose between them.Highly recommended!
2,intellectual muddle,"I studied symbolic logic and linguistics in college, so it was enjoyable to take a trip down memory lane with this book as it covered those topics and tried to weave them together. I say ""tried"" because I finished the book unconvinced there is any relevant relationship between the two and unsure what Devlin's point was. The book seemed very muddled to me, but maybe I just wasn't paying close enough attention. Overall kind of boring."
5,Shooting for the Stars,"If you've ever seen this band live you know what a joy it is to watch four guys and their audience interact with wreckless abandon. Of course, it helps when everyone in the band is nuckin' futs. If you like to groove, you can't miss. If they're near your town, don't miss them, or monkey or robot may come. That wouldn't be good. God Bless Evan Patrick Leach."
4,The Best Live CD Ever!,The first time i heard this CD it was awesome. All the energy of the band when you see them live was right there coming out of your stereo. Elephant Boy is a great band and I look forward to hearing their next CD. The drummer and the bass player really clique together
1,only wax ring that doesnt come with bolts,"this is the only wax ring i have ever purchased that doesnt come with a set of bolts to secure the toilet to the flange. the wax ring also had a small crack, which was easily repaired prior to installation.i cannot recommend this product."
2,"Loved the book, but not the video","The producers of this film managed to take one of Twain's most enjoyable and hilarious books and turn it into a dull and lifeless ""movie of the week"". Perhaps my expectations were too high, but the humour and spirit of the original work was completely lacking. Not recommended. Read the book, it's wonderful!"
2,a little high-brow,"This particular Word-of-the-Day calendar tends toward more scientific unusable words. I've used calendars in the past that have given me the opportunity to try to use fun new words everyday but these words have no day-to-day relevance, which is really sort of a shame."
4,sweet marmalade,"I ordered this marmalade after reading the reviews, and although it is nice, it doesn't have the flavor of English marmalade made with Seville oranges, it is a lot sweeter."
4,"Great for ""My Little Pony"" lovers","My daughter, who is almost 5, is a big ""MLP"" fan. She wanted a MLP video for a while and was so excited to receive ""Princess Promenade"". When I read about the product, I understood that the video was 70 minutes long, and I was under the impression that ""Princess Promenade"" was the only movie on the DVD. It turns out that ""Princess Promenade is only one of two ""episodes"" on the DVD. There is another video about a Pony Birthday party on the DVD. Each episode is about 30 minutes long. There also is a cute short video too. If your child is a MLP fan, this video will not disappoint."
4,A toddler dream,"My daughter's favorite video by far. the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because i cannot stand the pony that says ""dahling"" every 5 seconds. Very annoying to listen to!"
5,MY LITTLE PONY THE PRINCESS PROMENADE,MY GRANDAUGHTER COLLECTS MY LITTLE PONIES. THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF MANY SHE HAS AND SHE NEVER TIRES OF WATCHING THEM ALL. NICE MOVIE FOR MY LITTLE PONY FANS
3,Princess Promenade Review,The video is an excellent addition to someone's little pony collection. My daughter watched it several times singing along and acting out different parts.
5,My pony DVD,my granddaughter loves my little pony anything and since she was coming to visit thought this would be good to entertain her - she loved it!
4,Totally exceeded expectations,"Totally exceeded expectations, instant favorite for my daughter, hard for an adult to sit through, drags a bit."
5,Good Deal,"I've been using these for several years now and they work great. They are hot swappable if your computer/Sata adapter supports that.One word of advice: When sliding the top back on the tray after installing the HD, make sure you get the top on correctly! If it is at an angle there will be a slight gap between the mating surfaces and you'll find it difficult if not impossible to insert and remove the tray!Don't force it, it may be a little ""stiff"" when brand new but it shouldn't take herculean effort to shove it in!"
3,Ok for the price,"The Kingwin line 811, 812, 813, in my opinion is a reasonable value for the price. However, if you can spend more money, perhaps look to CRU's ""Dataport""s.Oh, and for the buzzing noise: If you take out your H.D., there's a rather large thin metal plate underneath. I eliminated the noise by: removing the plate's one center screw (opposite end from the electronics at the rear) and pushing the metal plate (very slightly) AWAY from the fan cages.However, when I put the screw back-in, I had to place it only slightly back into its hole, and, the screw was NOT centered and positioned at an angle.But, the flat metal plate is anchored and THE FANS DO NOT BUZZ!Good luck! :)"
3,Some redesign is needed,"The electronics of this system workes as advertised, however the engineering and quality could use improvement. The door of the tray holder has a very weak spring that breaks soon after installation of the unit, so the door doesn't close when a tray isn't present. The closure latch on the inner tray is very delicate and will break off if you're not really careful. The fans in the unit use nylon sleeves rather than ball bearings, so the fans become noisy after fairly short periods of use. Both I and my brother have used these racks and have had these problems with the system."
5,Great rack and tray,"I have used these rack and trays for about two years. They work great for hold a back up HDD, or other HDD's you want to swap out. I finally went to RAID 1 and I didn't need the three I had installed. I took out two racks and their trays and left one in my computer. A little loud at times, meaning the fan or fans. But you can turn off the rack when you don't need it."
4,AOK. Better than other options,"This version is better than the other Kingwin SATA enclosure where you have the hard drive's connector being used as the only disconnection means. This model uses a sturdier large connector and is superior. The fans in both models are marginal and this one, too, makes a buzzing noise on startup. Oh well, the fans still work but I ignore the noise."
1,"Kingwin KF-813-BK Storage Mobile Rack 3.5""","The Kingwin KF-813-BK - Storage mobile rack - 3.5"" is absolutely terrible in material, workmanship and performance. And Kingwin has no toll-free phone service to call and let them know about this product. To get an RMA number, you have to pay to phone them, and then the process to get the RMA makes you jump through hoops in the form to fill out, including a picture of their product. The mobile rack is clumsy and inconvenient to use, the fans make a terrible buzzing noise too. Hopefully I've made it clear that I will never use this product nor anything from Kingwin. And I' very reluctant to get anything from Amazon ,since they carry this horrible product. Bye."
4,"Voyate to the Bottom of the Sea: Season 2, Vol 1",This was a very good show and viewing the DVD brought back a lot of memories of my younger days.
2,"""The Monster from Outer Space""","plain. simple. easy to understand, no pretention.performs as advertised, value for moneyepisode is as title suggests"
3,Good Series - Cheap Release,This is a Great TV Series but this Dividing TV Seasons into 2 parts (for higher profits) Stinks! The Double-sided DVD's with NO graphics (for higher profits) ALSO STINKS! Otherwise (meaning the TV Series itself) is Great!Come on Hollywood - LOOSE THE GREED!
3,For older child,I had hoped that I could open up this book and there would be many 'simple' project ideas to choose from with readily available materials. I was specifically looking for projects for 6-9 year olds. I was slightly disappointed to find that there were no simple projects to select from.
4,Maybe the book is great but amazon.com sucks,"I purchased this book 2 months ago together with another book. Total price (including shipping) was $37.09. I've waited for 2 months and somehow the books were not delivered. So I sent a mail to amazon.com explaining them the situation. They informed me about sending the same books for $43.09 cancelling my previous order and refunding the money which was paid 2 months ago. Oh, and they also say I need to wait another 1 month for the delivery. So, I sent them another mail, saying I didn't want the new shipping and wanted them not to send me the books. Now I got a response; the books have already been shipped...What kind of a policy does amazon have????"
2,I have 2006,It is better as it comes on a CD and the Graphics and play calling are great but the biggest pet peeve i have is you cannot save a game whikle playing and it is easy to hit a button and take your self off the game which like i said the game does not save games so if you are at 1:00 to go in the fourth quarter and you hit a wrong button you lose your game and must start over. EA is a cheap company that really should be held accountable for this garbage packaging No manual either have to download that. Way to expensive.
4,"A classic, fun Destroyer!","When a rich, spoiled, rock star groupie gets mad and decides to testify against Daddy's illegal activities for revenge, someone puts out an ""open"" contract on her life. Remo and Chiun are sent to make sure she makes it to the witness stand, but surprisingly, their worst enemy is the girl herself! Usually half-stoned out of her mind, the red-headed bimbo is so busy trying to ""do"" her latest favorite rock star that even two Sinanju trained assassins can't seem to keep tabs on her!This book is fast-paced and funny, taking outrageous jabs at hired hit men, radio personalities, rock music stars and their fans."
1,The Beatles: The Real Story of the Liverpool Street Kids,I was really disappointed in the content of this book. I expected and hoped for more substance.... Poorly done..
1,scam,"Do not buy this season. It is a ripoff as the episodes are 21 mins compared to 45 in other seasons. Instead of pricing according to time content, it is priced per episode the same price as other much longer season episodes. The total price is twice what it should be. Sneaky of Amazon to do that. Don't let them get you too."
5,An underrated gem,"As a neophyte to North Star, I picked up this album after Tempest and Power, both of which I enjoyed. Extremes, however, is in a league of its own. The band is in top form with this album, and I think it embodies all that is good about progressive music. The music is melodic but not clichéd, and some of the keyboard segments are truly remarkable. This is also one of those rare albums that doesn't have a single weak track; you won't hit 'fast forward' with this underrated gem. Highly recommended."
1,I LOATH this book!,"this is the absolute worst book i have ever been forced to and have ever read. i would like to add that i made a very strong attempt to get more interested in the plot of this book because it was a school assignment, but jeez, this was cruel and unusual punishment. when i think of this book, the word that comes to mind is ""torture"". i like a number of books and i love to read, i usually don't have a problem with book assignments, but this was just...just really mean. If you are smart, you will take my advice and stay far away."
4,Will Adam find his father and his pet in medieval England?,"This book, which won the 1943 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature, is a novel about an eleven-year-old son of a minstrel in the England of 1294. The boy, Adam Quartermayne, and his dog go on the road with his father. However, his dog gets stolen and Adam becomes separated from his father. The reader follows Adam as he searches for both his pet and his father. Children of ages eight to eleven would probably enjoy this book which gives them a little glimpse of life in England during the Middle Ages."
4,Adam of The Road,"Adam of The Road was a pretty good book. Personally I think she could have wrote it better. I thought it was ok, because I could feel the pain that Adam felt throughout his journey. People who like to read about medieval times would really liked it. It was hard to follow, but it was written very well. I like the way the nouns were described, and the action words really sounded like an action. The only sugestion I would give to the author is to elobrate on the other characters more. I also liked it because, the other characters had a close bond with the central character. -Sammy H."
3,Adam of the Road,"Good book for a middle school reader about a young, would be joker in medieval timess."
4,Hard to follow but a good book!!!!,I like this book because Adam has a quest. As a ministrelhe searches the land for his father and on the way he loseshis dog Nick and he searches and always seems to get hurt butsomeone always helps him. (WHAT A BOOK!!!!!!)
2,The Road to Nowhere,"This book made it easy to understand why someone would feel badly about losing their dog and spend a lot of time looking for it. Also, if you don't know a lot about the middle ages, you will learn something about poverty and entertainment at that time. However, the plot of this book is WAY too predictable. You know what is going to happen in the end. It is also too unrealistic. For some reason, everyone the main character meets in the book acts as if he is some kind of lost relative or god. So they are more generous than we think real people would have been in the middle ages.Newton Boys Book Circle"
4,They do the job.....,Not a bad product at all...helps your muscles develop more rapidly after exercise. The only problem is the amount of tablets that have to be taken...Its a bit much.
4,Great product...,It's one thing when you notice gains but when other people notice thats even better. This product works as advertised and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested. The pills are a bit large but its well worth it in the end.
1,this stuff poisoned me,just recieved and smells like a dead cat :(((i thought its normal and tasted 1 tabletstill got terrible stomach ache and don't know what to doanyone had the same problem?i live in Georgia(Europe) and have problem to return itemvery disappointed
1,Not for me - use it or you lose it,"This is not for me. Everyones is different, this product is good i gained noticeable muscle the months that i used it. BUT the reason why am giving it ONE start is because it gave me some problems. Low sex drive. Everyone is different but if you use it and you start having problems on bed, this product is the reason. As i said everyone is different, this product is not for me.USE IT OR YOU LOSE IT-All the muscle the gain while using this product disappeared after a week that I stop using it."
2,Undecided,"I've been lifting for about 8 years now and I'm 6'1, about 240 lbs with 18'' arms and a 49'' chest. I'm telling you this as I've gotten to the point where I've plateaued in my lifting and I was looking for a way to get beyond the plateau. With that out of the way, I'm not sold on this product at all and I didn't notice any change what so ever when taking these pills. So after taking them for about two months, my conclusion is they do not work for me. Also, pretty much all the amino acids in these pills are available in most protein shakes and the protein shakes offer more in the way of protein."
2,Not very pleased,"I've been using this product, as directed, for one month.I have to say that the pill size is just too big, and the price of these pills just isn't practical because the quantity doesn't last due to the amount you have to take each day.I haven't seen any respectable gains and am just not satisfied with the results of taking this product. I think I'll just stick to my Pro-5 Protein Powder, liquid creatine, and a phytonutrient supplement; combined with a heathly diet and exercise. That has always seemed to work the best for me! Thanks for reading."
2,Not for me,This product is not for me. The pill was huge hard to swallow. You have to take several pills a day which 250 tablets does not last long.
5,Good Aminos,"My husband bought this and would drink it after his workouts. He likes them, says they work well and wants more."
3,Its fair,"Its alright, notice a little more definition but not mega mass like the bottle said. One side effect I noticed is increased hair growth. Amino acids are great for your hair."
5,Ice Age,"I love, love, love this movie. I laughed so hard the first time I watched it. John Leguizamo is so funny as the voice of Syd the Sloth. Ray Ramono was great as the voice of Manny. Great kid movie, or for the whole family."
4,"Not as good as the first one, but still pretty funny","This sequel to Ice Age is not quite as funny as the first film, but it still has plenty to recommend it. Scrat, the manic sabretooth squirrel, is particularly entertaining in this one."
4,ice age,"Bought this to show to my seventh grade science class, but as of yet we have not hit where this fits into our year yet"
4,Entertaining,My kids love this movie... all 3 movies... everytime I show them the box they run to the sofa to watch the movie.
3,More of less,"This is a typical sequel. To capitalize on the success of the marginally better original, the producers have knocked out another story. This one makes less sense, has pretty useless add-on plot details, and plods to a predictable conclusion. There really isn't anything new or original in any of this, so it is just background noise to parents while the kids can pass time amused by crude slapstick. The 3 stooges did it already, and better. As such, this is a bore."
1,A Kid's review no wonder kid's are so screwd up,"This movie is completely full of both Sexual innuendo and Bad Language's, like eating a parent's child if they get left behind. and a grope in the genitals, mean and crazy characters, and an annoying song's are your idea for a family movie.A crazy female mammoth is not what you want your kid to see, or watch.Avoid this like the acid...Don't say I didn't warn you."
2,IT MELTDOWN THE SEQUAL,"For me, it was not that good. The first one was way better. First of all, the storyline was good. But the way they made it, wasn't. Very boring and not that funny, for me, they let me down. Ray Ramono and Queen Latifah were the main charactors and plays a role where they have to go a certain direction because it is the begining of a new ice age. ANd there is going to be a big flood. So they have to escape.Kind of a snoozer, no that great. Don't see it."
4,Better than second one.,The movie I felt is better than the first one. It will appeal more to the grown ups than the previous one did. This time you will get crazier adventures of Scrat the squirrel. I got the region 3 dvd and it was ok nothing special. Cannot comment on the region 1 dvds. The film on the whole is enjoyable if watched once (max twice). I felt Cars was technically far better than IA2
2,My 4 yr old thought it was scary....,"From a parents view I definetly thought this sequel was violent comparedto the first one. We saw this at the the theater, and almost had to leave.If your expecting this to be just like the first one, you'll be upset. For afamily with young children, I would suggest renting this before you buy it."
2,It's ok,My 5 yr old laughed and thought parts were funny but he was ready to turn it off about an hour in. I thought the first one was better.
3,ice age 2,Fun movie for the whole family. Once again the squirrel steals the show. I think ice age 4 is still the best one. This one seems to lack something though but im not sure what. Over all an ok movie for us.
4,Family Fun,Lots of fun for the whole family. There are varied humor styles that should be able to please everyone. It's actually better than the first one if you ask me. The little side-stories they have with Scrat are wonderful and kids really get a kick out of the slap-stick comedy of it all.
4,Entertaining,"While I think it has a little less charm than the original, Ice Age 2 is entertaining enough for children and the parents that bring them. The story brings back your favorite characters Sid, Manny and Diego and adds a few new fun ones. The story begins with the discovery of the melting ice that will soon flood the mammals valley and the subsequent flight to safety. It also deals with the possibility of the extinction of the mammoths. The story is nicely done, and the squirrel and acorn are back quite often throughout the film. The action is mostly cartoon violence, with a few little jumps. The humor is gentle with the only cursing involves the word ass(which is used for the actually animal) and a beaver saying dam(after his dam is destroyed). Overall it is a nice story you can enjoy with the kids."
4,Funny - Good Family Movie,"The Ice Age series is cute - good for kids and adults! The squirrel is as always searching for the acorn, which my 2 1/2 year old thinks is really funny."
3,No meltdown here,The adventure begins again. This storyline was cool and it was a fun movie. Children will learn about trusting and helping their friends. My daughter still laughs at when she watches it.
4,Good for the whole family,"Great animated film, you never realize how difficult it is, to secure an acorn, until you view this picture. Good Entertainment."
4,"Great graphics, very nice resolution. Shows Blu-Ray well.","Contrary to the first Ice Age, this version has much improved Computer Graphics capabilities, and you can see the details in the hairs, feathers, and even teh forests, lakes and glaciers. It is a great showdown for BluRay capabilities, and it's a world of difference from the standard res DVD.Worth the extra cost. My son was glued to the screen the moment I put it on. Although he's only 4 1/2 he did notice something was very different with this movie. Also the 5.1 recording and mixing is very well done."
3,It's OK,This is an excellent rental. The kids had a good time watching it but have not popped the DVD in since.
3,"Good, not Great","While I still want to see the first Ice Age, having seen the second one first, I must say I am not so impressed with what the media and friends have said. Don't get me wrong, this was surely an enjoyable movie, however it simply did not meet my expectations.The whole film is a retreat from melting ice. Since the characters live in a sort-of-bowl, they have to escape from it to survive an inevitable rush of water. Their journey is to a boat made from what appears to be a giant tree. I have to admit, as I look back at this film a few days after having seen it, I must say that the general plotline is not so exciting. However, the interesting characters met along the way are delightful and bring this movie some life. This is not to say that the main characters were lifeless. In fact, they all had unique and interesting personalites.I guess after seeing ""Flushed Away"" I just have a gneral feeling that ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" was good, but not as good as ""Flushed Away""."
3,Stupid 1.33:1 format,I have I don't understand the decision to encode the Full screen version for Tivo. There should also be a Widescreen version for HD Tivos.It is expensive for what you get.
3,WILL HE EVER GET HIS NUT?,"The sidebar storyline of the prehistoric squirrel trying to get just one nut is my favorite part of this sequel, which is certainly well done, but derivative and repetitious. This time our heroes, Manny, Sid and Diego are faced with defrosting of their homeland and set off to avoid being drowned. A nasty army of sea lions complicates matters. We also get Ellie, a mammoth who thinks she's a possum and two mischievous possums who she thinks are her brothers. Kids should find it entertaining and adults will probably be entertained too. The voice casting consists of Ray Romano as the mammoth; John Leguizamo as the underappreciated Sid; Denis Leary as the stoic Diego; Queen Latifah doing her usual shtick as the confused mammoth; and Seann William Scott and Josh Peck as the frisky possum boys.The animation is top notch, but I felt like I've seen it all before."
5,For Me,"I'm 59 years old and I love this one, I see it a lot and enjoy it everytime, I will continue to purchase movies and the prices are awesome, thanks"
4,Good sequel,"I found this to be almost as funny as the first one. There is a very good cast of new voices with characters that are well developed, in some cases a little overdone, but overall a very amusing movie. This is a movie that younger children may not appreciate, but older ones will. The story line is easy to follow and there are some wonderfully funny scenes as well as some good drama."
3,Ice Age - The Meltdown,This should have been PG-13. It had several hidden adult themes in the movie. Unecessary language was used. Not at all like the first one. Dissapointed at the context.
1,Terrible quality,Couldn't even watch the movie. We have a Google Tand Amazon VOD needs to create an app just like they have for other devices.
1,Wouldn't play,The movie would not play but I was charged for it anyway. Not worth the effort to try this service from Amazon.
4,Entertaining for the most part,"Take it for what a cartoon sequel should be: more of the same from the original. The film has funny moments, and certainly is entertaining for the young ones. However, the biggest disappointments about the film are two-fold: it doesn't seem to go anywhere very quickly, and many of the jokes are repeated over and over again. Perhaps we can forgive an animated movie a little more for being formulaic at times? This is what one should ponder.Still, it is a fun family movie for the most part, and the personalities for the characters are fitting and done exceptionally. Denis Leary and John Leguizamo do superb jobs with the voices for Diego the tiger and Sid the sloth, and both those characters seemingly take on their personalities.The scenes with Scratt are hilarious, perhaps some of the funniest moments of the film. Overall, this was a decent sequel, but, once again, it is nothing tremendous.3 1/2 stars"
3,Average storyline,"Specific situations (Sid worshippers) and characters (the possum-mammoth) are not someting I'd personally dream up, but the general storyline and execution were fairly predictable. Scrat on the other hand, he's hilarious. Poor little rat has no luck at all, but his antics are great."
4,Second time around,"I am sure the kids will/did love it, but I didn't think it was as good as the first."
2,Poor,"Like so many movies, after too many followup releases the plot becomes strained. We saw the same type degradation in the Land Before Time series. This is a confusing waste of time."
4,Good family movie,My kids and I enjoyed this movie. There are some moments of danger/peril that caused a little anxiety. Looking forward to watching the next two in the series.
3,Ice Age-the Meltdown review,"I was appalled at the language that was put into this movie which is for children. I think that Hollywood has forgot who would be seeing this movie. The world is bad enough without them putting such language in a movie for the kids to repeat.Otherwise, the movie was good."
5,The best film of 2006! - An amazing accomplishment!,"This movie is my pick for ""Best Movie of 2006""!!! I certainly didn't think that the original film could be topped, but ""Ice Age: The meltdown"" proves to be one of the best sequels EVER churned out by Hollywood!This film is Laugh-out-loud funny and yet also delivers some very sweet moments sure to bring a tear to your eye! A fantastic script, incredible animation and superb ""voice acting"" combine to deliver a near perfect film in every way. I cannot stress enough that this film works on EVERY level, succeeds at everything that it attemps, and can be enjoyed by both children and adults!If you're looking to add a DVD to your collection that will provide pure escapist entertainment and a huge supply of laughs for years to come, choose ""Ice Age: The meltdown"" - my nomination for best picture of the year, 2006!-JM"
3,2nd best...,"I don't know why they have to make seconds and if they do they should at least live up to the first one! If Queen Latifa hadn't been in this one, I don't know what would have made this funny!"
4,Even better than the first,"There are children's movies that stand out from the pack in each year's offerings, and this is one. Ice Age 2 offers if possible even more humor, drama, and dazzling visual effects than the first. The voice-over cast principles from the first flick also lend their talents to this film, especially Dennis Leary, John Leguizamo, and Queen Latifah appears as well, who wasn't in the earlier film. There's more music as well, and some of the references to adult films are part of the humor and the fun--such as the allusion to Esther Williams's water ballet films when the vultures are doing their song number, which was delightfully clever and very funny. It's a fine film for the whole family that's as funny as it is visually appealing."
4,Noah's Ark From the Animal's Point of View,"The Funny Squirrel Is Back as cute and loveable as ever. Ice Age is good entertainment for children. It might be a bit bland for adults. Interaction between the characters saves the film. After two films one enjoys watching the characters as one enjoys watching a favorite TV series. However, if I had to choose just one children's animation film I'd probably go with ""Over the Hedge"" or ""Cars""."
3,Ice Age The Meltdown,It was O.K. I ordered it for my grand-children and they are in another state so i hope that it was a great gift
4,Just as funny as the first,I loved this movie. I think that it is a movie for the whole family. It was both funny and touching. I would recommend this movie to anyone that wants to share a laugh.
4,Ice Age 2-The Meltdown,Good movie for being the second in a series. Most are not as good as the original-this one is
4,Hard to find anywhere,I had a hard time finding this item because I guess they quit producing but you had copies at a reasonable price.
5,ice age,"ice age is always great, very cute for younger and older kids, the charcters are very funny especially the squirrel"
4,Pretty Good,"Drama, comedy, romance, and suspense all wrapped up in one. If you liked the first one, you should like this one."
5,Christian Science in Japan,An amazing story. I found it intensely interesting to learn that the Japanese language doesn't translate the ideas of God that Christian Science sheds light on so completely and multi-facetedly. I learned so much! A very good read for a Christian Science seeker like myself - someone who is trying to learn as much of the history and thought that developed into The Movement I know and love and enjoy today.
5,"This vacuum really ""sucks! ""","It really does! I used a small one (8 gal.) and I'm going to buy this big one because if the little one works as well, just think what the big one can do. I think it's quieter than the old 6 gal. Shop Vac I have had for quite a few years. I'm getting this one to ""upgrade."" I've seen other reviews, and am buying it because of them."
1,Will make a skeptic out of believers.,"This is my first experience with Chicago Ghost Investigations and it leaves me with a sour taste. This 'movie' is more or less just an hour and ten minute training video on dousing rods. For the first half hour you are treated to a demonstration of someone 'communicating' with a relative of theirs and not any real haunted sites. The next half of the movie is letting the recruits out to play with said dousing rods. The camera angles aren't very good and there's a gratuitous use of night vision when the room is lit. One could argue that it was used to make the dousing rods more apparent, but I would argue that adjusting the camera position would have the same effect.Even those who aren't skeptical and are looking for an excuse to believe will have a hard time swallowing this.If you're looking for a decent paranormal investigation movie, you won't find it here."
5,It's a Filter,These filters fit the Shop-vac brand vacuum cleaners. The packaging appears to be OEM. Nothing more needs to be said.
3,Can't say,"I haven't used these yet so I can't review, but I'm sure they will be just fine. My review is neutral."
2,Did not fit,I thought this was the correct reusable filter for the Shop Vac 4 gallon All-Around model. It didn't seem to fit. There's nothing wrong with the filters. They came on time and have no defects. I probably did something wrong.
2,"Not OEM Shop-Vac, price up almost $2???","Be advised FWIW, the bulk pack, in no retail packaging filters I received were not Shop-Vac brand as the listing states. Also, despite the company knowing their listing is in error, you will not receive one, let alone the three retaining rings mentioned in the listing. Just a few weeks ago I paid $4.40 here on Amazon with Free ship after $25, now they are up nearly 2 bux... That is simply gouging, and along with poor, snarky QS from Crucial vac, and known product deception, I'd look elsewhere."
2,Too Much,Go to Harbor Freight to by three bags for less that $3.00. The Shop-vac bags are basically paper circles and not worth the money.
5,Fit my shop vac great,"These filter cloths fit my small shop vac great. They were much less expensive here on Amazon than at my local hardware store. Only my local True Value carried these filters, which seem to be somewhat hard to find."
2,"OK for really small jobs, but the big collection bags are the way to go.","OK for really small jobs, but the big collection bags are the way to go. These clog up too fast unless you are doing a really small job."
4,dry filter disc,"product arrived in good time, outside package was dirty but product inside was dry unused and clean. thank-you"
1,Beware,"I work on Labor and Deliver at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. I have seen many of Nancy Wainer Cohen's disasters come through our doors in hopes that they can be saved by our doctors. Amazingly, Nancy does not even call an ambulance for these cases. Instead, she chooses to drive these women to the hospital herself. As one father stated, ""I knew something was wrong when I realized she was driving 80 mph and running red lights just to get us to the hospital."" Sadly, his child ended up in the NICU with uncontrollable seizures. Although VBAC's can be a beautiful thing, Nancy Wainer Cohen does not use good clinical judgement in whom she decides to help with home births. Her words cannot be trusted."
2,Not one I'd recommend as a factual unbiased guide,"I am facing this choice and was looking for some good factual information that would help me make that decision and be comfortable with it. This book comes across like some earth-mother, new age diatribe. I kept looking for the useful information and never found it."
3,VBAC highly over rated!,"No book is a ""bible"" for any type of birth experience. But A+ for validation; for any woman desiring to VBAC and wants extreme statistics to feel more at peace with her decision."
4,Major Research on C-sections,"This book hits hard and cuts deeply into the obstetrical practices of the American medical establishment. Its major premise--that the majority of Cesarean births are unnecessary--is well made and substantiated. Though the size of the book might be intimidating, it is worth digging through. The personal stories of births, both awful and wonderful, are well worth the trouble and drive home the major points of the book. ""Silent Knife"" is a good recommendation for any birthing woman--though she may never trust a doctor again.(This review was previously published in ""Daughters of Sarah"" May/Jun 1985. Sadly, the number of Cesarean births has not significantly declined since 1983 in spite of alternative birth options. A recent documentary states that induced labor and deliveries have increased dramatically which then also raises C-section rates as a result.)"
5,Silent Knife is a comprehensive guide to VBAC,"This book is extremely helpful in setting guidelines, establishing facts drawn from medical research, and offering the best of support to women contemplating VBAC. It is a must-read!"
4,How to make money growing trees,This book covers a broad range of issues that are neccessary for someone to be a successful tree farmer. It could use more depth in some areas but over all it is a very good source of knowledge. It should be on every tree farmer's shelf.
3,Good for the money,"the filtered water is significantly better than the tap water. Not terribly difficult to install with included tool, however the gasket from the adapter to the faucet head makes a poor connection as it is slightly too loose, and the other gaskets were too big to allow a connection. It would have been nice to have a metal adapter. with properly fit gaskets."
2,Leaks,"Product leaks at the faucet connection. Tried to unattach/reattach numerous times, flipping washer, etc."
2,Couldn't Connect to Faucet,This only works for the old fashion faucets with threads on the end. I had to return this model as I could not connect it.
4,I love it,"This system uses very reasonably priced cartridges, so I changed from my Pur system. There's a minor problem with the switching valve, so water trickles through the faucet when the purifier is in use."
5,Water filter,Just what we were looking for. It came in at the right time in good shape. Ordered replacement cartridge too.
4,Works like it is supposed to,The water at our cabin is very hard and leaves lots of calcium on water glasses etc. This filter removes the heavies and we don't notice the stains in the glasses anymore.
5,Easy install and operate. Filters becoming hard to find.,The best thing about the design is that it is easy to see when the filter needs to be changed. The switch that allows you to change between filtered and unfiltered water is large and comfortable to use. And its overall streamlined design with the rest of the unit means that you are not constantly bumping into or hooking your sleeve on the knob when not in use. None of our general and hardware stores that used to sell this seem to have the replacement filters in stock anymore. Thank goodness they are available on-line!
4,Well-mounted on-faucet filter with metal fitting,"I tried a succession of on-faucet water filters. Brita, Pur, and WaterPik all attach the filter to the faucet with a threaded fitting made of soft plastic, so that within a few days you get a fine spray of leaks around the fitting and, within a few weeks, the filter will fall off the faucet if you bump it. Worthless.This filter, in contrast, attaches with a threaded METAL fitting: strong, secure, and leakfree. The only problem is the filter: it is effective only for chlorine taste and smell, and has no effect on lead or microorganisms. I didn't realize this initially, but that is why it's 4 stars instead of 5.I ended up passing this one along and getting aCulligan FM-15A Level 3 Faucet Filter, which also has a secure metal fitting but instead of the ""chlorine-only"" filter of the Instapure, the Culligan uses a level-3 filter effective against lead and microorganisms."
2,poor connection to faucet,"The installation was pretty problem free. The water flow is good when fullyconnected and the design is sleek.There is one major problem and that it that the filter will not stay connected. Thescrew well is too shallow to hold the filter securely. The water pressure from the sinkis enough the blow this filter completely off. I find myself re-attaching the filter at leastfour to five times daily. Lately I've just decided to leave it off since I seem to waste somuch time re-attaching it to the faucet. That being said, I find it's more difficult to usethat it's worth. I would buy this one again."
4,startlingly mind opening,"Truth is one of the most subjective and utterly elusive things humans have ever conceived, and this book makes it evident, while at the same time coming up with ideas and arguments which shed light on whether or not truth can be had and if so, to what extent. Very readable, and extremely insightful.~jjg"
1,Warning...,"I would like to point out I ordered the fifth printing of ""Theories of Truth"" and pages 307-338 are missing. To be more correct, they are replaced by pages 51-82. The most amazing thing is that the missing pages contain the material on the disquotational theory of truth--the ONE section I needed.Perhaps my case is unique, but one would think the MIT Press could get this right."
5,Great sequel! Can't wait for number three!,I was so glad this book was issued earlier than first reported. The dialogue is beautiful and the reader is kept on edge by the ever-changing plot. I think Kate Forsyth does a wonderful job and I can't wait for the third issue in this series. I hope this is the beginning of many more from this author.
4,Good!,"This was a good book. I enjoyed it just as much as the first book in the series (The Witches of Eileanan). The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the dialogue still gets on my nerves, and there was even MORE stuff lifted straight from Jordan's WoT series. A horn that calls ghosts to fight a war? I couldn't believe the audacity of the author to put that in her novel. Ignoring that though, this book was very good and I can't wait to read the third."
4,pretty OK book,"This was a pretty good book, but I agree with the others that said that it wasn't as good as the first. It was way too depressing and I didn't like how they didn't kill Maya off, but I suppose they'll do it in the third book. I was also pretty sad because Meghan is going to die (we all know it) and I wish that Isabeau could get at least some of what she had wanted cos she suffered so much! and I think that Lachlan/Bacaiche should have grovelled a bit for forgiveness. Other than that, it was a pretty good book!"
5,Yay for Ms. F!,"I must say, I think this is a great book, and even though it has sex in it, I will recommend it to my friends. I also liked how it was so in sync with wicca. Ms. F must have done her research! (Or she's wiccan) If you are more interested in wicca, I recommend doing an author search for Silver RavenWolf or Katherine Eliska Kimbriel! very very nice book. A jewel!"
3,"It was good, but not as good as the first","Sometimes, after reading the first in a series, you think that the second will be kind of monotonus, especially when they are the size of these books. But the author solves this problem by focusing on the other sister. In a way it was very frustrating, because I wanted to hear more about Isabeu. I felt that the author turned around and made Isabeu a weaker character than she was in the first book. Yes, she went through a lot but still... It just didn't seem correct. Her sister comes out very well. I almost didn't like her in the first book, but changed my mind after the first two chapters. It would have been a better read if I didn't know the characters from before."
1,NO KINDLE EDITION,WHY is there no kindle edition of this book? I am very disappointed. Either amazon or the publishers are at fault for this.
3,"""Classic"" screenwriters with no mention of Frances Marion??","When I received this book I eagerly turned to the index and was amazed to discover no mention of Frances Marion, one of the greatest - if not THE greatest - writers/scenarists in pre-WW II Hollywood, male or female. How can anyone write a book about screenwriters without mentioning Frances Marion??As I work my way through this book I begin to wonder if anyone bothered to edit it. On page 38, my jaw dropped when I saw that V-J Day was actually in 1946, not 1945! And, while some of the ""conversations"" are very interesting (e.g., Arthur Caesar, Sidney Buchman) some are mere nonsensical snippets that had me wondering why they were included."
5,The Best Single Disc Out There On This Artist,"I say artist since Merle is indeed an icon not some single/45 maker typically known to this genre of music but a serious artist that is best served up on individual albums showing his development or with the great box set ""Down Every Road"" that beautifully sums it all up and belongs in any serious CD collection.The song selection here on HAG is a great mix and flows seamlesly and is enough to turn any rock fan into a country fan.The sound is extraordinary as is the running time and liner notes and overall a great CD that included his famous duets with the great Johnny Cash(from the CASH CD Solitary Man),and the classic Willie Nelson cut Pancho and Lefty as well as a newer track with Toby Keith spanning a trip down memory lane circa 1962- 2005..Interesting photos of Merle standing over a grave site within as a middle age man with additional shots of him younger and the elder statesmen which he now is, akin to 2006 when this great CD hit."
4,Good solid Haggard listening,"There's nothing like seeing and hearing the legend in person, but next best, this CD contains a lot of classic Merle. Worth the acquisition !"
4,always the best,"You can have all the new country singers, but the old timers like Merle and Willie Nelson, Patsy Cline, they are all time greats. Alan Jackson is the best of new country."
4,Paul's gift,For me to rate this purchase would be unfair. It was purchased as gifts for two very different people. They both say they really enjoy it. That is about all I have to say about it.
2,Skip it!,"Porter's writing is rich in description, that's much as I can say! But this is such a tedious read--halfway through it I gave up! Please save your money. I don't regularly write reviews, but I just couldn't let anyone waste their time and money reading this!!"
1,Not the same as Shop Vac filter,"Amazon appears to rotate this item from one retailer to another. In my own case, the filter I received is a generic filter and not as advertised here. This filter is NOT manufactured by Shop Vac. I purchased the Shop Vac wet filter at a store, and it is made from a courser foam material and is a slightly different size. The filter listed here may work, but be aware, it is not made by Shop Vac and is not identical to the real item. The filter I received did work on the newest 16 gallon Shop Vac, but it was a really tight fit."
1,Wrong sleeve,"Please note other reviewer comments. This sleeve DOES NOT FIT newer vacuums. Customer service quickly handled my return, and contacted seller to inform them of the problem. Don't order this sleeve with a new vacuum."
1,"It's not as shown in picture, and seems to be a clone","It's not as shown in picture, and seems to be a poor attempt at a clone.It's a foam tube with one diameter. There is no expanded region at the top.I struggled to fit it over my 12RT300 shopvac cage. It was very tight, but it finally went on, and I was able to put the sheet filter over it.Will not buy again. Will probable try to make one with foam and superglue when this one fails."
3,not as nice as the original filter that came with it,"cheapy foam filter, does the job, but I wish my husband hadnt lost the original one!"
1,Not OEM - Poor Quality,"I read the previous reviews before ordering; noted the bad reviews, then decided I would try the filter anyway since there are a few good reviews. That was a mistake, because the filer's seam split open during the initial installation just as others have described. This is the correct filter for my vacuum, however it is poorly manufactured. I recommend that Amazon discontinue selling the item."
4,Shop Vac Foam Filter,"I own several Shop Vacs for my business. For the best filtration of sawdust and other dust, I use this foam filter sleeve along withe the Dacron cloth filter bags that are washable- seeShop-Vac 901-15-19 Super Performance Dacron Cloth Filter. Both the foam filter and the cloth filter bag are reusable for a long time, and washable. Mine gets daily heavy use, as I own a chinchilla ranch. I wouldn't want to be without these! It keeps the dust from bathing the Chins down to a minimum."
5,Didn't have any issues.,"After reading the other reviews here I was skeptical that the filter would fit my shop vac, and was prepared for a return.However, it ended up fitting my ShopVac 1x1 (not sure what vintage since it's a flea market purchase, but certainly no more than 10 years old) just fine. Can't tell if this filter is OEM or not since there's no branding on the bag or filter, but the construction appears adequate for the purpose. Just be careful during installation to prevent tearing the seams.Purchased in conjunction with the reusable circle filters item # 901-07-19, the ShopVac I got for $5 because it was spitting dirt and dust all over the place became a useful item. The price on Amazon (as of July 2012) is significantly better than ShopVac's own site due to shipping."
1,Bait and Switch Foam Sleeve : Don't buy this product,"What you see in the product picture and what you get are totally different items. This claims to be Shop Vac part number 905-85 ??? Take a look at the shopvacstore photo [...] ... Now take a look at [...] (linked from Amazon's site). The foam sleeve you get for this item doesn't even look as good as the one from [...].Fortunately Amazon has EXCELLENT customer service and return policies. I'd strongly suggest they review this vendor and ""tune-up"" their product listing to reflect reality and not a bait-and-switch product. I'm guessing most folks are too lazy to return a $6.00 item. I'm not."
5,EXCELLENT CD!!!,"This CD is well worth having, it blends jazz-era orchestrations, modern R&B and hip hop.Lina is Billie Holliday of the new era!"
2,STRANGER ON EARTH,ONLY TWO SONGS THAT WERE APPEALING. I'M NOT THE ENEMY BEING THE ONE I ENJOYED MOST. I WAS DISTRUBED BY THE USE OF FOUL LANGUAGE IN OTHER SONGS. I FOUND IT UNNECESSARY AND THOUGHT THE ARTIST LIMITED HER AUDIENCE BY USE OF SUCH WORDS TO CONVEY HER IDEAS.
5,Excellent product,"This TV mount is well-made and fairly easy to install. It is very sturdy and is obviously capable of holding up much more than my 32"" Flat-screen TV.I highly recommend it!!"
3,Strong unit for mounting,"Very sturdy and functional unit. Swings effortlessly and easy to install. Mount this into a stud using a stud finder, a socket wrench and a level (making sure the pilot holes are straight), and you save a lot on installation. Mounting the TV on this unit is best with two people and know the layout of the screws and insertion points before you dangle the TV in the air for mounting. One final step before mounting is to plug all of your cables into the back of your TV set. This unit covered most of the input jacks on my set and taking it back off the mount to make adjustments is just too bothersome and risky. This may not be a problem if your set has jacks out of the range of where this mount need to be screwed in."
1,didn't get what I ordered.,"I ordered a mustang mt-arm2, but got a mustang mv-arm2. am left holding the bag as the vendor has yet to acknowledge mistake, provide me with return mailing label, or return my money."
2,"Great Watch, but my tabs also broke","I love this watch and use it for swimming and general use. However, like others, a tab which hold the wrist band to the case also broke--rendering the watch useless. I didn't drop the watch, the tab just fractured. The watch is only 8 months old. Casio must have some problems with their plastic technology as others have expressed the same problem."
2,Great watch except for the exposed crystal,This is a great watch (especially for the price) with the exception that the crystal is NOT SUFFICIENTLY RECESSED to be properly protected. I have not significantly scratched up a watch in the past thirty years - but I scuffed this one TWICE in the first week of use. I recommend spending the extra money to get a G-Shock model. (also by Casio) That is what I will resume wearing when I get tired of looking at the damage on this one.
4,Great value,"Good quality, perfect size, and all the basic functions necessary for an every day casual watch. Fits a medium size wrist very well. Like the overall appearance as compared to other basic digal sports watches."
1,Broke then got a replacement and that one broke,"The replacement watch also broke just at the end of the band. One of the pieces that comes out of the case to hold the band is what broke. Unfortunately, it broke 7 days after my return allowed day. I wore it to work about 5 times and played tennis with it about 5 times and that's it.It is a very light watch and not as thick as most.However, If yours also breaks, don't say I didn't warn you."
5,"versatile, reliable, accurate","I bought this recently to replace one I've had for 15 years or so that finally quit. While the battery is said to last 2-3 years, mine have lasted 5 years or so. I love this watch. I've swum with it, dropped it, no problem.It has a count-down timer, stopwatch and dual-time functions; button placement makes it easy to manipulate. So light I hardly am aware of it. I've had to replace the band a few times. THEY last maybe 2 years. 18mm generic neoprene bands are available at Kohl's for about $5. A great watch at a great price!"
3,It Breaks,"While this is a perfect watch in other respects, Casio needs to work on its durability. I have owned two, each lasting a couple of years before one of the arms attaching the watch to the band broke off. No longer usable as a wrist watch. I am tired of replacing it, and so will probably look for something different."
5,Great watch for the price,"Has all the basic functions I will ever need - stopwatch, alarm, and illuminator. Extras include dual time, etc...But this is a great watch. Solid - I've smashed it several times already and it's still holding. I'm sure this will last for years. Another Casio classic that hasn't disappointed.Update:I know this is late but, as other users experienced, my strap broke after just over a year of use. I guess that's the watch's Achilles heel."
4,Favorite watch,This is a great watch with the dependability of Casio and a countdown timer to boot. (Countdown function is scarce these days on watches). The alarm or signal on this watch is the loudest I've had. What a great watch! The only down side is the crystal seems to scratch too easily.
5,All the watch I ever will need,"Great watch. No need to ever spend more than this in my opinion. Might last years, but if not, no big deal. A small but significant thing, the band is perforated all around, which means it can be worn on a very small wrist, like a child's"
3,Just OK. Can't find anything better,"Second watch to break in 2008. In both cases, one arm that holds watch band broke off. These watches are basically disposable. I like the features (stop watch, countdown, alarms, light). Hard to find inexpensive watch with features listed. Many have lots of features or are gaudy and cost much more. Would love to find something better."
3,can't turn off the button beeping,"greetings. i just got the watch but don't know if i will keep it. any push of the buttons to access its functions emits a beep. not horrible i know but the less things in my world beeping the better. also, i was looking for multiple timers and this has only one. 411 for you! have a peaceful day."
5,An inexpensive watch and works very well,"I bought this for my 12 years old son. The watch is inexpensive and very functional. It's good looking too. He wears it 24/7. Now, he set the alarm at his watch before he goes to bed. However, we still need to wake him up in the morning most of the time. It's not that the alarm doesn't work. It's just that he stays up too late at night and hard to get up in the morning."
1,Beware,I can't wear this watch if I do any physical activity where I would sweat because the inside of the watch steams up so bad that it's not readable. Consequently it spends most of it's time in my pocket instead of on my wrist. I won't buy anymore watches from Amazon.
2,Good watch..Till it stopped working only 3 months later !!!,"Liked the watch and was able to snorkel with it and have no water intrusion. However, only 3 months later it stopped working. I even tried a new battery, but that did not help. Since the watch was never dropped or treated roughly, if you choose to buy this model, you may get a product that will not last very long."
2,Great while it lasted,Great while it lasted. I had to replace the watch strap after 1 year. This thing died on me after 3.5 years.
3,Review of Casio Men's Watch,"This watch is ""OK"". It is smaller than I thought from looking at online photos. (Maybe online photos should include a scale showing actual size?) I can live it, but I would not have purchased it in a store. My former Casio was larger, & I mistakenly thought this down-scale watch was an identical replacement. It has the features I need, especially alarm & stopwatch, and the features are fairly easy to figure out, so I'll wear it until I find something better. I must admit that I am a little disappointed."
3,below average for the price,"While I have found CASIO to be good quality, it befuddles me as to why this watch is'nt waterproof.I have bought this same watch before at about the same price,and it was waterproof and lasted for years. So WHATS UP? LESS QUALITY FOR THE SAME PRICE, must be made in China."
1,Failed in five months,"Bought five months ago, this watch no longer functions properly because some of the pixels in its display have died making the time unreadable. This should not happen with ordinary wear and tear and is a disappointment since Casio watches have a good reputation. I'll think twice before I buy another one."
1,Not recommend!,"The watch stop working after 2 1/2 months, I only wear it twice a week and is not in rough use. I tried replace the battery, only the light work but no text. I have own several casio watches, this is the worst I seen. Also, the plastic case is very easily scratch."
5,This is a superb DVD,"Compared to the other live DVD's that are on the market today, this DVD blows them all away. The sound is perfect (comparing the Live Dosage dvd to Slipknot for a second) When Corey sings/screams, there is no bleed from the stage sound, as there is on Live Dosage, so the sound is as if you're hearing it from the recording studio. I love this sound. There is no phase problems from the vocal mic picking up guitar or drum sounds, I commend who ever the sound engineer was. This DVD is the great for anyone who enjoys Dolby 5.1 surround sound."
4,okay okay,"I gotta admit, you gotta love Slipknot. What other band is as great as them? This DVD proves that there isn't. I love the songs and the part on the second disc where you can have multiple camera angles on certain songs. I would always watch Joey drum. Who wouldn't? You need to go and buy this DVD. It's just so great."
5,Fantastic,"I knew about Slipknot, but never really listened to them. I recently bought Iowa and liked it. So I bought this DVD. I took it home, put it in the DVD player, and when the band started playing, stood in my living room with my mouth open, completely frozen.What a show. Wow!!!If you are a fan of the band, you'll totally dig this.My wife doesn't appreciate Slipknot at all, I showed her about thirty seconds of People = S**t. She sat there with her mouth open and then said, ""This is a total spectacle.""The sound is great. The video has too many quick edits, but it fits with the music.This is excellent.Buy it."
3,Awww that sounds bad,The content of this DVD is excelent. Many live songs and all their music videos. The downside is the sound quality is just horrible. I think they did it on porpuse because even the songs not recorded live sound horrible. If you can stand the poor sound quality then deffinatly get this DVD.
5,Good if you are a Slipknot fan.,"I am very pleased with this DVD. I'm not the biggest, hardcore fan of Slipknot, but I really enjoyed this DVD. The concert was filmed with 30 cameras, edited so it seems like a music video. It has fantastic quality. The DVD also includes many features such as behind the scenes and all of their music videos. Sure this may not be good as a concert, but who cares?? Slipknot isnt going to be touring anywhere in the US for a long time. I highly recomend this DVD to any Slipknot fan."
5,Insanity just pure unadulterated insanity,"Now band DVDs are supposed to suck usually, right? Well this one by far takes the cake as the BEST band DVD ever created. Some people here have praised Joey's drum solo which is insanely great I admit but my favorite was Sid's solo on the turntables. Both before gently and after. It was just the best peice of DJing I have ever seen next to hip hop. I recomend this DVD for all my fellow maggots and those who wnat to know what a live Slipknot experience is like. By it now."
2,Too much cookie for my monster,"Very intense show. Band is together visually and has tons of energy. It's my first Slipknot purchase and didn't really sell me on the band musically. Great guitar talent spends vast majority of the time banging out one-finger detuned chords. Vocals are cliched cookie monster growl almost always. Drums, on the other hand, are mind-meltingly slammin'. Overall, it's not bad but, to me, it lacks the variety and creativity of a Godsmack or Disturbed. I'm sure the purists will disagree but, hey, it's my review and my honest opinion."
3,"Great design and function, horribly delicate band.","A light, very functional watch for both runners and fashion wear. I always get compliments on it's looks, with its large, wrapped face and ergonomic wrist angle. The watch's only flaw is it's delicate band. While its mesh design is great for allowing the skin to breathe, it also makes it delicate in daily use for removing the buckle. The watch material's chemical formulation seems to be susceptible to quick aging when interacting with perspiration, causing some discoloring and brittle cracking in areas that are often flexed when taking the watch off. It's a shame too. Its such a cool watch. I'm on my second one, but I won't be wearing it as often in an attempt to lengthen its life as the watch is no longer produced by Nike."
2,Not really waterproof,It was billed to be water resistant to a respectable depth - but it filled up on the first dip in the pool. Practically DOA. Returned it for a trusted brand.
5,Indian Boy Costume,"I was a little hesitant spending this on a costume but my son who is 9 years old, has been wanting one for some time now and I was very satisified with my purchase after receiving it. The quality is well worth the money. The material is very soft and the fring and everything is sewn very neatly. Very well made and very well worth the money."
3,Son loves it but not durable,"My son loves the costume and it wasn't bad initially for what I paid as the sale price. However, after only one brief wear (inside only) by my son the fringe started unraveling on one leg. Too much trouble to send it back so I just stitched it back up as best as I could but I hope more of it doesn't continue to come off.I gave it 3 stars for educational since the costume does generate learning opportunities with questions from my son about native american culture.I went with Large (10-12) for my 8 year old based on previous reviews and it worked out perfectly. In regular clothes he wears a size 8."
4,Heeeere's Johnny! The Special Collector's Edition,"Johnny Carson never disappoints you. He is a natural! His timing, his facial expressions, he is for real. Maybe that's why he was so funny and his program lasted so long! He is truly missed!"
1,Missing DVD's,"I was disappointed to find 3 of the DVD's from this set not included with the order. I only recived 7 DVD's, not the 10 shown on the webpage for the ENTIRE COLLECTION.The Ultimate Carson Collection, Volumes 1-3 from 1962-1992 was not included in this order.After waiting over a month for delivery, I was disappointed it was not the complete set shown on the webpage to order The Special Collector's Edition, which show 10 DVD's not the 7 I received.I have contacted Amazon by email & will report back if they send the additional 3 DVD's shown in this expensive collection."
4,A Little More Profanity Than I Remembered,"I had seen this movie years ago on HBO TV and I thought it was great at that time. It reminded me much of the company where I worked which was also run by a brilliant engineer. I had recommended the movie to many others and finally decided to buy a copy of my own.However when I watched the movie this time, I was startled by the amount of needless profanity. The story line is believable especially since it is based upon a true story, and I liked the acting. My only complaint would be the language.As usual with Amazon, the tape was just as advertised and delivered on time."
2,I love paranormal romance but not this!,"I am always looking for a good vampire romance novels. I was excited when I read the reviews for this one. So excited that I bought all three books (and paid almost $60). What a total waste of money. All three books were poorly written. The character development is non-existent. The sex is not sexy or enticing. There is no build-up in the relationships, everybody simply loves each other for no apparent reason. The only thing going for this series is the author's imagination. Don't waste your money of these books!"
2,"No development of the characters supposed ""romance""","The first book called One With the Hunter is very strange. It begins good but the characters, Shai and Val just jump in the sack together, then after about 2 or 3 times in her bed she wonders who the heck he is. At the end you have no idea whats going on but somehow she just trust and loves him. Then she just dies, which is confusing because the author doesn't tell us how it came about so fast, then she becomes a vampire and thats it. No real good development of the characters and no real plot for romance, the sex scenes were average, I've read better. Wasn't really worth my time, I won't even read the second in the series."
2,Disappointed,"This book promises to instruct anyone on how to hike and bike the desert safely. As a generalized overview to some (not all) desert travel it is sufficient for that purpose, but I found it lacking in many subjects crucial to remote desert hikers. Trip/water planning, gear prep, finding water from natural sources, trip navigation (map and GPS), first aid for desert and heat sicknesses, etc. could have all used a lot more material. Coverage of some deserts and specialized advice was lacking. The book emphasizes coverage of 'high' deserts like the Great Basin, unfortunately, at the expense of others. And forget anything outside the U.S., as it's not covered here. I probably would have liked this book better had I not read the Ultimate Desert Handbook, which covers the same subjects a lot more thoroughly, not to mention the diversity of many more deserts in North America and around the world."
3,notr the best but not the worst,luda copies the west coast flow on here and features nate dogg which is the best thing this track has going for it.
4,"Oregon Scientific JM889NA-S Jumbo Atomic Wall Clock with Indoor Temperature, Silver","Very nice digital clock, however, wish it were larger and more suitable for living room wall. Also, though the time displays well during the daytime hours, but unable to see during the evening/night. It would be nice if the manufacturer put a feature in where numbers illuminate during the evening/night time hours."
5,On Time,"Very Happy with this product! Easy to read, always accurate, and still there after a power hit! It took a day to sync with the atomic clock signal, but after that it has kept sync. It's simple, it does what it is supposed to do, and it does it right! What more can I ask!!!!"
4,A novel to be readed,"An interesting novel with a plot placed in exciting countries. Characters have the intensity of latin people. This novel got the second place in ""Premio Planeta 1998"" (a famous Spanish award) but a lot of readers opine that it is much better than the winner."
4,Bomber Timepiece,"You have to love an inexpensive watch that is basically indestructible and lasts for years of constant abuse. As a field biologist, hiker, backpacker, and river-runner, I always find it useful to know what the date and weekday are since my outings sometimes cause me to forget about the calendar thing. Love this watch and hope they never stop making it."
5,Love This Watch,"I love this watch and have owned five in the past ten years. They are cheap, keep excellent time and the light allows me to see what time it is in the middle of the night. The only drawback is the watchband that breaks after two years without fail. A replacement band costs more than a new watch so I just buy another new one knowing that it will be good for two more years."
5,Trusty Dependable,"I got this watch years ago on Amazon because I wanted a cheap alarm watch for travels. My thought was ""Why pay hundreds for an expensive watch that tells time just as well as this one? And if it breaks, it's [...]."" Turns out, this watch has gone with me to Antarctica for three field seasons now. We go out into the deep plateau, and camp out for weeks at a time, hundreds of miles from the nearest base. It's survived with me camping out at -46C one January. The buckle finally broke last week when I banged it into some equipment in the lab. I'd probably buy another, and keep the old one as a memento of all those trips."
2,Not what I thought,"I purchased the watch for our son for Christmas. The band and watch face was too small for him. No problems with the mechanics of the watch, just the size is smaller than we thought it would be."
2,I am not satisfied for this watch,It is not as good as i expected. Each particular button doesn't work well for me to change or upate time and date or light button..
2,Not a very good Casio watch,"This watch only lasted about 3 months. The problem is the case that holds the metal pin for the band is made of plastic. For me this means when I was doing yard work, and the pin was ripped from the plastic casing and permanently destroying the watch.As for the functionality, it was easy to use. Big buttons that were accidentally hit frequently changing the time from 24hr to AM/PM. Also missed leap year, and does not have a month displayed, but these are minor issues.Still a huge Casio fan, but just not a fan of this particular watch. Check out other Casio's like the Waveceptor, they're amazing for just a little more!"
2,Weak Case,"The watch runs fine, with all the features I want. Only one problem. Approximately 10 days after receiving and wearing the watch, a portion of the watch case broke. A rather crucial portion -- the small area where the pin that holds the band is attached. In trying to follow Amazon's rules for returning (or repairing) the watch, I recieved time-consuming run-arounds, including countless attempts to reach a live person (""All operators are busy assisting other customers, so please call back."") ... first from Ace (the Distributor), who referred me to Casio, who referred me to their repair center, who referred me to their local repair center. I'm still waiting, approx. 2 weeks later, for a call back from the local guy."
5,Who cares about Titanic???,"Atom Egoyan is a master of human emotions: grief, love, loss, avarice -- the good and the bad in people. I wanted to see this movie as soon as it came out, but it didn't play in any theaters next to where I was. I was finally able to see it for the first time in a small, packed theater in Paris, France. Having the video is great, but nothing beats seeing it on the big screen. The crash scene is riveting -- there was a collective gasp in the small screening room. We all knew it was coming, but still all wished it didn't happen. Yet, we all watched as if hypnotized by the images in front of us. Sarah Polley is a wonderful actress, and a pleasure to watch (she is also terrific in ""Go,"" out in the Spring'99). She also has a delightful voice, and the original score is mesmerizing (I strongly recommend the soundtrack). Beautifully photographed and edited, a horrible tale greatly told. The Sweet Hereafter was definitely the best movie of 1997."
5,"Top-drawer ""translation"" of a novel.","Egoyan has accomplished the near impossible: a movie richer and more interactive than its parent novel. He adds a multi-textured layering of times to supplement the book's multiple points of view. The risk of overly confusing fragmentation of the book's largely linear narrative is counterbalanced by the interweaving of Sarah Polley's voiced-over ""Pied Piper of Hamlin"": the result is a movie unusually balanced between the town's grief-driven fragmentation and the hope that narrative may make some sense of the fragments and reconnect past to present."
1,Incest as a Sweet Candlelit Experience!,"Excuse me, but didn't anyone except one reviewer here notice that this novel revolves about repeated and ""soul-robbing"" incest between Sarah Polley's character and her father, which is why she lies during the deposition. The Pied Piper of Hamblin that she reads throughout the film is a metaphor for incest her central horror and concern. The candlelit scene between her and her father implies mutual consent which derails the book's ending where she lies to get back at her father. Read the book where incest is shown to be the horror that it is. To show it as romantic is irresponsible both to the book's intention and to the actual experience of incest. Oh well, just underline the Ego in Egoyan and you get the picture!"
5,Best of the Best,People who hate this movie are afraid of the places in themselves this movie may touch. Very SAD!!
1,Very Disappointed,"This movie was rated highly, but... I found it completely boring, I didn't like or even care about one character. I watched to the end just to see what happened and ended up just shaking my head. Don't bother!"
4,"accident, tregedy, incest, adultery, love, father and daughter","what a sad story. lot of people in this film were suffering silently. what a boring high sierra snowy winter tragedy. the lawyer's daughter, the surviving daughter of that tragic accident. 'there must be something deadly wrong if your daughter chose to lie in front of you.'what a sad story."
3,movie good; book a thousand times better,"the commentary by russell banks made the movie more interesting and enjoyable. from the sound of the dvd, the director will be patting himself on the back well into his sweet hereafter."
2,Please wake me when the film is over,"At the end of The Sweet Hereafter, I had tears in my eyes- tears of boredom. I would like to use this forum to point out the parts of the film that annoyed me. First of all, the incest scene is ridiculous. The young girl is not raped by her father, rather, they make love together. Candles? Why? It was like a scene out of a cheap romance novel. That scene actually made incest look sweet. The father looked like he was his daughter's age! Second, did anyone else notice that the bus driver had a Minnesotan accent while she drove the bus, but not any other time in the movie? Did the director forget about that? The book is a lot better than the movie, and the book isn't that great. The lawyer in the book is much more energetic, the incest is what it should be, dirty and immoral, and the scenes were drawn out way too much in the movie. Of course, what do I know?"
5,The Wheels on the Bus,"If you have children, plan to have children, or know of any children living in your area seek this movie out. From it's haunting opening music, to its somber, yet life affirming tone, The Sweet Hereafter is one helluva soul jerkin' drama.It gives you a gut punch/ sucker punch combo all the way through, a harrowing study of the reverberations and impact of an instant.Sarah Polley is an otherworldly talent, portraying a child possessing creepy wisdom and the voice of a dew eyed angel.People still talk about this film today, because it entrenches itself into the minds of viewers with a conscience. Quite possibly one of the saddest, smartest, and touching films I've ever seen.The soundtrack is mesmerizing, you will feel compelled to purchase it.P.S. If this movie doesn't get to you in some way your heart is but a cinder."
1,Ice cold movie,People should quit taking advice from so-called critics who claim this movie was a masterpiece. The plot stunk and I could care less for the characters. Watch Affliction if you want a good dark artsy film. This flick was more like the Rotten Hereafter!
4,a gripping movie from Egoyan,"Atom Egoyan basically shows you the lives of the people that were struck down from a horrible accident, the accident being the most shocking and disturbing part in the movie when a school bus falls over the side of a snowy cliff full of kids and then it slides onto the ice, cracking the ice and it falling in. some children died. emotions run array. Ian Holm in one of his best is an attorney who has to deal with his own problems with his rebel teenaged daughter who fancys drugs and sex. Bruce Greenwood and Sarah Polley are riveting also in supporting roles. one of 1997's best."
5,An Excellent Masterpiece,"This movie is a masterpiece, see it. There is also something to mention about the movie, its music. Persian Flute performed by Hossein Omoumi was just fantastic."
4,Hauntingly beautiful!!,"I saw this movie after I had read about it in a list of 100 daring movies. It truly is, in so many ways. The scene with the school bus is one I will never forget. There are many layers to this movie, and I enjoyed them."
5,Beautiful,This movie will reasure that movies with a more quiet and subtle persona can still get made in this era of special effets orgies that have taken over Hollywood. It is a beatiful film that explores the depth of human emotion better than most in recent memory.
2,Bitter Diatribe,The book starts very well in the first chapter but fails miserbly as soon as the primary hero(?) is introduces. He is a tortured insecure black lawyer who is and afraid at all times of being confronted with his lack of ability and characterThe second protagonost is a self appointed messiah - a legend in his own mind -who inspires all he meets. His sycophants are perfect cardboard characters.A perfect film for the existinh Hollywood stars and starlets.
2,3 out of 8,"Bloodstone's ballads are usually great and there are only 3 on this cd, ""Just Like In The Movies"",""This Is It""(not to be confused with Michael Jackson),and my personal favorite ""Give Me Your Heart."" I don't even play the rest of it, just those three over and over. The others seem like they're on a different cd,like they don't exist. I hate them. Personally i don't mind it, because i'm a big fan of their ballads and i get them wherever i can. They should put a cd out with just their slow stuff. I'm sure it would be a great seller. The three songs i would rate 5 stars, but not this cd as a whole. The other 5 cuts go right down the drain!"
1,If only I had known!!,"Of all the approximate 2,000 cd's I own, this is definitely one of the sorriest. I mean, how could a group like Bloodstone produce something like this? I sat and listened for a cut on the cd I might like.....Zero, nada, zilch!!!! Only been caught like this a couple of times. I hope never again!!!"
4,Chandler is the man,"All the stories are packed with action and very engaging. Of all the three novels, Chandler is at his best in Farewell, My Lovely with his concise, imaginative descriptions and metaphors that kept me amazed throughout.The Big Sleep is a solid novel with a good story rendered in unique prose. The High Window definitely drops in quality in my opinion, but still delivers a highly entertaining story.After reading these novels, I have little choice but to read the rest of his oeuvre to see if he attains the quality of writing he does in his second novel."
4,very good,Prompt shipping. I love the American Master Series if you are playing catchup and have no previous recordings (or if you can no longer play your format!!)
5,Peter Rowan at His Best,"I loved this because it is Peter pure and perfect for those of us who love Bluegrass at its soleful best. If you haven't listened to Peter or Bluegrass before, this is where to start. It sets the standard so high that you will have work hard to find its match."
3,Only 300mg out of 1000mg of EPA/DHA combined,"This product only has 180mg of EPA and 120 of DHA, which is less than 1/3 of the essential omega 3's you need. Which means 700mg of this capsule are filler fatty oils. I don't understand why none of the fish oil products on amazon contain the EPA/DHA amounts. If i would have know this before hand, i would have never bought this product. The EPA/DHA amounts should equal the MG stated on the front of the bottle. For example, 1000mg of Omega 3 Fish oil should contain something like 600 EPA and 400 DHA or something close to it; even 500/300 would have been a way better ratio. Try to aim for at least 2/3 and nothing less.On a lighter note, the taste is pleasant and no fish burps so far.I love amazon, but in the case of fish oil, just pay a couple bucks extra and go search for your fish oil @ a vitamin store."
5,The best Melatonin I've had,"Although the previous reviewer hated the taste, for me the peppermint version is quite refreshing. A bit like a peppermint lifesaver, although these are not candy. The sublingual usage prevents your digestive tract from breaking down the melatonin, so you get the full dose. This is sleep magic for me."
3,"okay, sketchy in some places","The book has good treatment of some aspects of using Debian GHU/Linux, such as upgrading the kernel, but doesn't appear to be uniformly thorough in it's discussion as it might have been. I'd recommend considering titles written by several people, where more knowledge is likely to be available, before purchasing. Also, this is the first edition of the book, something else to consider when comparing it with other titles. The tone, by the way, is informal. Please considor my earlier review (if it appears) to be obsolete."
1,Don't Buy This Book,"When I bought this I was so excited to begin reading the stories in it. They seemed good when I read the back cover, but boy was I wrong. I wish I had never picked it up.First of all, the stories deal more with relationships than with mysteries. The stories are cliched, and pretty much no good. The worst story of all was the Christmas Cache. It had nothing to do with Christmas, and barely had a mystery to it. The other stories were pretty much just as boring and slow moving.If you're looking for a good mystery for the holidays try some by Valerie Wolzien, or Carolyn Hart."
4,Excellent Read For Any Season,"I'm not usually a big fan of short stories, but they are a good way to ""try out"" several new authors. These are character-driven stories with well-developed plots. I liked these people and would like to spend more time in their fictional worlds! I'm going to look for full-length mysteries by all four authors."
1,not the same fitment,"Ibought this hose because it was 20 bucks cheaper , and the end had fitment issues. identical to the old hose but differant end"
3,Simplistic & One-Dimensional,"Although the behind-the-scenes maneuvering of the Washington powerhouses are interesting (although vomit-inducing), the plot, characters and dialogue are pretty cardboard. The main characters act with repeated stupidity, and the villains are totally one-dimensional & lacking in an even-handed depth. If I had written this same fiction, it never would have gotten published, so you figure out why it's in print..."
2,Trying to do too much too soon. Too pat.,"FIRST VICTIM is one of those books that start out great and then get lost in the middle. I became involved in the plot from page 1, but by the middle of the book I found things just too pat. Characters were one-sided; lots of background was referred to and never explained and, finally, the deus ex machina of the 'terrorist' plot was just too much. I was disappointed"
1,Violent and disturbing,"The cover and first couple of pages in this book give no indication of the contents inside. I am really disappointed I found this in our elementary school's library. The book is filled with violence, torture, blood and other disgusting behaviors. Can we not even have a safe place for our youngest children to check out books? I am so glad my older daughter looked at this book and told me it was inapproriate for children. I never would have guessed from the outside."
4,Still have not finished reading...,"I got this book on referral from a friend, but have not been able to really sink into it so far."
5,God Name God,"I must admit I approached this book as a wary atheist. After all, Cosmology used to be the ugly stepchild of academia. But Dr. Bhaumik has done his homework. Step by step he takes us from Michael Faraday to Stephen Hawking to lay out a convincing argument for a unified field of consciousness. Along the way he gives a concise summary of how lasers work (he made his fortune developing lasers for LASIK eye surgery) with additional stops along the way to discuss photons, electromagnetism, the Big Bang and quantum mechanics. He loves his work and the scientific method - and it shows. The light Hollywood gossip may distract some readers but the science is solid. Agree with him or not, you will not be able to put the book down without being disturbed - yet oddly soothed. Something's going on out there."
3,"Best deal on Bachmann G scale track, BUT NO CLIPS!","Hi,What can you say, if you break a piece of your Bachmann Garden G scale railroad track, this is the place to go. Hammond's provided me great service, and sent the track priority mail. It arrived very quickly.BUT and it's a BIG BUT, they don't include a track clip. If you are replacing track, keep the old clip. If you are extending track, this may be the best deal but you'll need to find the clips that hold the track together elsewhere.Overall, five star! Just be armed with knowledge. Oh, and I only gave it two stars on durability, because Bachmann track is cheap and cheezy! It's no reflection on the seller. If you want real track for outdoor apps, go with LGB."
2,If you pay more than $7 per section please request dinner,"Folks, please be aware that this press steel track usually sells for Far Less than $100/section. Do yourself a favor and shop around. You can buy an Entire Train Set, including a circle of this track for about $170. It is not intended for outdoor use, but works pretty swell under the Christmas Tree. For those interested in Largescale Trains, you would do good to look into a few online forums. LargeScale Central and MyLargeScale. YMMV"
2,Not what I thought,"I was interested in a professional etiquette book but there were far more chapters on how to raise your kids in a today's society and african religions, interesting but not what I wanted. Rather then provide info on how to behave in certain social situations the author focuses on her position about social behaviors and issues.....not that useful when you want to know what all those utensils at the table are for. If I had an opportunity to check out the table of contents before purchasing this book, I wouldn't have."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"If you want a biography instead of actual etiquette tips, this is the book for you. Otherwise, stay away. It has no practical usage at all."
2,"Too ""Visualize Your Inner Child""-y",I usually like almost any Buddhist book but with this one I found myself alternating between eye-rolling at the Inner Child Visualizations and cringing at all the unpleasant experiences that we are meant to embrace with Radical Acceptance.
3,Radical Acceptance,"The subject of the book is good, unfortunately, the used copy that I purchased looks like is has some water damage. Luckily it doesn't smell moldy but I will toss it when I'm done reading it. Don't want to take a chance of contaminating my whole library."
4,Tara Brach Challenges Your Thinking,"Ms. Brach's book is a different approach to wellness. She encourages being present in your daily life, rather than always racing ahead mentally. She promotes accomplishing this through guided meditations. These meditations are thorough and require a certain amount of discipline to follow. Ms. Brach's books challenges the reader to drop the ongoing dialogue and planning the flow through one's head continuously. Instead, she asks the reader to really accept what is happening in the present moment--good or bad, recognize how the body reacts to it, and then just be with it. It is a radical way of thinking. However, she does not leave you hanging--each chapter breaks down ways this can be accomplished in addition to the meditations. This is a good read for a person who is open to a more Eastern way of thinking. In my opinion though, it is not a book that should be rushed through--rather it should be read slowly to allow the reader to process each new idea per chapter."
5,"Readable, Relevant and Real","Radical Acceptance sits on my bedside table holding the honored place of a book that can be read and re-read many times. The insights and messages in this book speak to core issues we all face and the possibilities of how to work with them using wisdom and compassion. It is a book with honesty, clarity and strength of purpose that can only contribute to our understanding of self and others."
4,The Title says it all ...,"This was a real eye-opening book. I had wanted to learn more about how to meditate. I felt as if she wrote the book just for me. Not only did I learn about meditation but about how to change my thinking in ways I didn't even realize I needed to, which in turn, helped my meditation practice even more than I expected. Tara's book is definitely one to add to your library."
5,A wonderful book,"I highly recommend this book to anyone going through a life difficulty, especially to those who tend to beat themselves up about their difficulties!I found her podcasts on-line before I bought this book, and they changed my life. I'd been struggling with my meditation practice for years before hearing her talks. After hearing her talk I realised that what had been missing from my practice was compassion.If you're thinking of buying this book, but arent' sure whether it's for you, you could try listening to one of her podcasts first (just do a search on Tara Brach and podcast). I listen to one of her podcasts every day and am re-reading this book for about the fifth time.I do think that it helps to really put the ideas and meditation suggestions in the book into practice. I don't know how much benefit I would have had just from reading the book. The podcasts are good because she does a talk and includes short, guided, meditation sessions in the podcasts."
5,Philosophy in action,"This is one of my top books of all time--because it's applied philosophy with philosophy, and application, intact. This book is about doing, living, and being--it's not something you read passively, but something you put into practice actively. Tara, you changed my life and I can say I have a lot more peace and quite a few more smiles thanks to having read this wholesome, heartwarming look at how we can not BE BETTER, but just be us."
5,This is a wonderful book.,"I've been reading a few pages before I go to sleep at night. I am still surprised at how much comfort, calm, and peace the writing brings."
5,"useful for anyone practicing mindfulness, acceptance","Really enjoyed Tara's gentle, thoughtful approach to mindfulness and meditation. It's less of a guidebook and more of a meditation for anyone dealing with difficult life situations, so be prepared for the rather ""hands-off"" approach of mindfulness. It's not going to provide you with an easy ""10 steps to happiness"" or ""quick fix,"" but it might provide you with more valuable qualities of thoughtfulness and awareness."
4,Become my own best friend? Gulp!,"I remember being moved by the opening few lines, and chapter, and the idea of being our own best friend really appealed. It is a tough concept for me as I find self-love challenging and think it's a problem which many people have, and she really hit this nerve right at the start. I tend to ignore practical exercises in self-help books but in this case I did a few and really enjoyed them. The idea of giving up the racing, chattering mind story and simply accept what is happening can be challenging and the exercises helped to make it easier to apply."
5,Incredible Journey,"This is the best resource that I have ever encountered for accessing and healing trapped emotions, and achieving emotional equilibrium. The author's ability to explain and make the mind, body, spirit interplay readily understandable and available is stunning and life changing. I found the value of this book has been in awakening my ability to feel and to accept my entire emotional spectrum and to let it go. It has been an antidote for resentment, drama, self-centered thinking, self pity, numbed out emotions, and inertia. Its spiritual message is accessible and welcoming. As a non-Buddhist the spirituality here feels warm, experiential, authentic, grounding, and universal. I would recommend this book to anyone of any faith tradition."
5,AMAZING SHOW!,This is a amazing show. It makes me feel good and lets me forget everything bad that happens in my life when i watch this show. It changed my life and i'm proud of what i am now. Not shy and not afraid to follow my dream.
5,Truglo 2x 30 mm sight,"A very good quality optic. Really like the two color option and the multi-reticles on the sight. Purchased to mount on a Beretta Cx4 and it's like this sight was made for it. Perfect zero after mounting. For the price, you can't beat this sight as it performs as well as sights costing twice as much. A big thumbs up to Truglo!"
3,Too snotty.,"I heard this record playing in a record store & was struck by the song ""Tropical Ice-Land."" I knew my husband would love it, so I got it for him for his birthday. He did love it, but I disliked every other song on the record. They're too cold & snotty (and not in a punk way!). ""Tropical Ice-Land"" is absolutely lovely; the rest of the record doesn't sound like that song at all."
3,This is a great book for beginners.,"I found this book to be fairly informative and full of useful information particularly on techinique and form which is very important. But as I am not new to the sport of bodybuilding, I did find the book to be a little too basic. It would have been better had Anja included specific diagrams of each muscle group that you are working and how each muscle is specifically targeted with different exercises. Although I always refer to this book when I change my training routine, I'm finding that I am hungry for a book with a bit more bite!"
4,Good... but not quite Patterns,"While the book does keep it's focus on ""usability"" it really is about the best workflow and not about ""patterns"". Software patterns refer to meta-systems (such as say an eCommerce or Portal system) and how they are consctructed.I did find the workflow techniques quite helpful though. I give him credit for putting them in print."
2,the fundemental flaw; the book fails,"to credit what is said in this book, one has to believe in certain premises of Freud which have been profoundly discredited by Masson and many 21st century scholars who have proven that Freud falsified his materials on childhood sexuality, and on his assertions regarding parent child incest in particular. Freud infantalizes the human being, scorning the breathtaking gifts of the human for instead seeing the human, like himself, as a bundle of Victorian/ Viennese repressions and fuedalisms. If the author had stated his opinions, and they are opinions, not facts... his supposings about ancient humans are rank speculation at best for instance... and not built them on Freud's passe notions which are ungrounded and unproven, the book would have been credible at least as the author's imaginings about what might have been/occured/ been structured in human psyches long ago."
3,Not that bad actually!,"Frankenfish wins a solid 3.5-star rating with me. I wouldn't recommend buying it at this price, but if you can find it in the bargain bin somewhere or you rent it, you'll have a good time. I was actually quite surprised with this one. I'd been dying to see it since the title itself is just hilarious, and it came on SciFi channel one night, much to my delight. Believe it or not, the kills are great in this movie. I mean, it is a little cheesy, but very creatively done. And a LOT of people die by way of the Frankenfish. Part of the fun is trying to figure out who will die next. Good times. I absolutely recommend for a night of cheesy creature horror. It's certainly lots of fun, but not for the price Amazon has it at. Enjoy!"
3,TREMORS meets JAWS,"Big mutant fish get loose in a Luisiana swamp and start eating people. A small group get trapped on a bunch of houseboats with some big game hunter moving in to claim his prize, which would be the dead Frankenfish.This film ALMOST got 4 stars from me. I was a little disappionted. I was hoping they'd be smart enough to keep the sexual content under control but NOOOOOO. Points off for that.On the plus side, there's a good amount of gore and once the Frankenfish finally show up, They realize that they sho start focusing on gore rather then nudity.Besides, the CGI is pretty good. Check out FRANKENFISH on Tv if you're looking to kill an hour and a half."
5,One of my favorite creature features!!,"My husband and I love cheesy creature features. Pretty much if most people hate the movie we know we are going to love it. In fact we use movie reviews opposite of most people. If the critics love it we won't watch it, if they hate it we watch it right away!!! This is a good creature feature because not only does it have the typical cheesy blood and gore but it also has a good plot and some surprisingly good acting. The mandatory boob shot is there but short. It gets right to the killing and doesn't waste a lot of time explaining the plot and instead lets you figure it out for yourself while enjoying the blood and guts. Obviously totally ridiculous and unrealistic but if that's what you are looking for this is a good choice. For being a low budget movie the special effects are surprisingly well done. This movie also has some great dark humor and innuendos!"
4,Eat your heart out,"Oh man, where do I begin....this is a fun, stupid horror movie. Some of the effects are cheesy compared to what we get now in cheesy horror movies. The acting is actually pretty good. There are a few over the top characters, but what horror movie could survive without those?The movie takes place in the deep Louisiana swamp where people tether their houseboats and live amongst the gators and mosquitoes. Far, far away from civilization. They live off the swamp.A boat has run aground due to its crew being eaten by the genetically modified fish. The reason why they were being taken to a particular area will reveal itself towards the middle of the movie. The fish are very hungry for gators and humans. They also become increasingly smart too.It's like the Anaconda movies - entertaining.Unless you're a big fan of cheesy horror movies, I would recommend renting this one in lieu of buying it."
2,A chuckle or two sunk by CGI nonsense,"This is one of those cheaply made contemporary ""horror"" movies in which some halfway decent (if relatively unknown) actors and interesting locations/settings get sideswiped a by laughably bad computer-generated menace, in this case a mutant fish the size of a Volkswagen bug that haunts a remote enclave of bayou houseboat dwellers. Other reviews here give a more-than-adequate summation of the silly plot, but my ""bad movie"" pal and I spent most of our time counting the decapitations and remarking on how remarkably bad the monster effects are. The director wisely showcased the title creature only in very dark, quick, jerky shots to minmize how stupid and unconvincing it looks. I was halfway expecting a foam rubber puppet or latex mockup to take over the monstering duties in closeups or other shots, but apparently that would have run into money. It's a shame the MST3K folks never had a crack at this one, it would have deserved it."
3,3.5 stars for this surprise of a movie...,"And i taught this movie would be boring,, cheap effects ...but i waspleasantly surprise at how good the monster fishes looked and the waythey got and ate some of their victims... Ok, the acting was not top here,but ive seen much worse lately.... I would say 85% of the movie is great, and the rest could have been better.....and wow...i love the ending...For the creature movie crowd....this one must be seen.Enjoy"
2,some unexpected scenes,"For a cheesey monster movie, it wasn't that bad, it had the 'anacondas' feel to it, but people were dropping like flies. also, it's rated R for ""sexual content"" it should say nudity, there are 2 farely long very innapropriate boob scenes. i was very shocked. So for that and that the writters weren't very creative and killed just about everybody off, I give it only 2 stars."
2,Starts out ok,"After watching the first half hr i thought this movie had potential to be another great creature feature but when the houseboat attacks started the movie just fell apart.The characters stopped talking,plot ended and it was all fish.I don't really recommend this film at all."
1,"A really bad ""B"" movie or is it a Spoof?","While watching this movie I was not sure if they were trying to spoof the ""Anaconda"" series or what. This movie is one of the worst movies I have seen this year. Not only was the plot weak the character development was non-existent. The roles are your typical characters, the hippie/stoners, the crazy vet, the undervalued employee and the mean boss. The script even went as far to make the ""mean boss"" have some of the meanest lines you would ever hear, so that you would cheer for him to be killed by the monster. The problem is that the lines were so bad or not mean enough that I never got to that point. Stay away from this movie; I am sure you can find a better movie to see than this."
4,A Some what good movie,"I saw this movie when it was on Sci-fi, and I thought it was alot better than Sci-fi's other snakehead involving movie, Snakehead Terror, including the special effects but were kind of cheesy at times"
1,Skip it altogether.....,"I'm a big fan of the Lake Placid/Anaconda/Deep Bue Sea genre. This misses the mark by a far shot. Don't waste even a rental on it.Very poor casting, hackeneyed script, and bogus action scenes make this one a loser thru and thru. If you want to see a 'good' bad movie, check out Giant From The Unknown instead..."
3,Don't Throw This Fish Back,"There's nothing like a good swim in the river. The peace, the quiet, and oh yeah, those pesky monster fish that are swimming around eating the local ya-hoos. Send in a city slicker with fancy gadgets and a purty girl along side and you got all you need for your typical nature-run-amok yarn. Lots of blood and action, very little logic. I mean, after the first attack one would think swimming would be a bad idea. The monster is impressive, and there is enough action and suspense to keep it afloat."
2,THIRD WORLD LIVE feb 2006,"The two biggest groups to dominate the 80's Reggae scene were Steel Pulse' and Third World' and although I loved them both on Vinyl when it came to live performances there was NO comparison! Steel Pulse was notorious at the time for giving as one reviewer wrote ""LUKE WARM"" performances and when I saw them it was just that. And hey I shouldn't be complaining because I got into that show for free.. by the bands drummer! However if your a true fan of Reggae and you want to get blown away be patient and wait for the release of THIRD WORLD's LIVE DVD coming out next month.. I'm sure it won't dissapoint! Cheers"
1,Big Rip Off,"I purchased this dvd ( paid $35) only to get a defective disc that couldn't play in any machine. I had it exchanged only to get another defective disc that showed partly. The little bit that I viewed before getting a full refund was nothing more than a badly produced vcd. This is not very good for the reputation of this band... hmm,very disappointed."
2,Stories ...not good ones.,"I can't believe I spent $40 on this book. If it wasn't required for a class, I would MAYBE spend $2. It's just full of random social worker stories and they're not very well written. It's also super thin -- I was shocked to receive such a tiny, poorly written book that I spent $40 on."
2,Had to buy this book for class.,"The latest edition it about the same as the previous, but I would reccomend reading them both if you are a Social Work student."
4,CA-30 or CA-1,"I ordered two of the older model (the CA-30) wanting the black case and wanting it to be identical to several others I have. I really like the CA-30 and have had nothing but good luck with them. My Son's guitar teacher uses them too, so he is familiar with them. Simple, easy to use and accurate. Seem to last forever (so far!).What I received was the CA-1 model (without my agreement, but it is too much trouble and expense to return them). I don't like the look or feel of these as much. The case is an old-fashioned looking white/cream color. The buttons are to the right of the display on the CA-30 and therefore easier to use than the buttons on the CA-1 which are below the display.GraemeBear"
1,WHERE IS IT!?,"I am getting really impatiant, I ordered this about 2 weeks ago and put this under standered shipping but it never came. Please find out where it went or is.~Christopher Hwang"
5,No substitute for a Korg,"Yeah so, I was born playing guitar, and born using a Korg tuner, I have used others and they seem inferior to me....Korg is the only wat to tune!!!"
1,Bait and Switch,I ordered the CA-30 but was sent a different model - they claimed the CA-30 was no longer made. I always thought that if a product was discontinued a product of equal or better quality and cost would be sent out.
3,Beach Hair,"This product is okay. I feel like my hair needs to be damp, not totally wet, to spray on and then continually scrunch and play with so it doesn't weigh down my hair."
2,Not as good as expected,"I read a lot of good reviews, so I decided to give it a try. It doesn't seem to work that great for my hair. I have curly/wavy shoulder length hair so I thought it'd be good. It just doesn't do much for it. It's pretty expensive too. It may just be my hair type, but I won't be purchasing it again."
4,Beach hair at home!,Surf Spray is a fantastic product that truly makes your hair look and feel like you have been at the beach. I dry my hair first and then use this to bring out the wave in my hair. I always get several compliments and it is easy to use!
3,Good for beach hair,"This is perfect for the ""beach hair"" look. Although I struggle with letting my natural waves free, this product helps create the look. While I would not recommend for a serious job interview, it is perfect for the days you want those natural waves to come out and I have not found anything on the market quite as good for relaxed waves."
2,Horrible smell!!!!,"I tried this product in Sephora today, and while my hair looked ok, my hair instantly smelled like a homeless person. I was embarrassed to pass people as I walked over to the perfume section to help rid the stench this product left in my hair.I'd consider buying this if they fixed the issue with the smell. I've used a similar John Frida product and never had to deal with a foul smell like this!"
1,Not worth the $,I purchased both the surf spray and the thickener. The spray makes your hair tacky and the thickener too soft. Neither products were worth the $. I have Pantene products that are better.
3,Not for everyone,"I'm sure this is fine for some people, but I have naturally curly blonde hair. Naturally curly hair is naturally dry hair, so the matte finish of this is not good for me; I want something that will add a little shine. As well, the fact that my hair is a golden blonde makes it worse, because after using it my hair looks like dead, sun-bleached seaweed and FEELS like dead, sun-bleached seaweed. Again, some people may be able to carry off the look; for me, I just look like I'm not taking care of my hair. I don't think it's the product's fault, I just think it's not for everyone."
3,"works, but has an ick smell","I spritz this on my hair after I towel it off. Then I let my hair air dry and it does keep a nice, wavy look. If you blow dry too soon after applying this product, your hair will become a matted mess. The turn off for me is the smell! It's horrible. I don't notice it after I've applied it, thank goodness. But, while spritzing it I'm always thinking ""ewww...I HATE this smell, I HATE this smell!!"""
2,Waste of money,"I like the way my hair looks at the beach with a little salt spray in it, but this did not give the same results. Made my fine hair look limp and dirty."
3,There Are Better Surf Sprays Out There,"I was originally turned off by Bumble & Bumble surf spray's high cost, but I read some good reviews and decided to try it anyway. My first impressions were that the spray makes my hair sticky and the smell is not attractive at all. Functionality-wise, it does give a nice tousled, beach-hair texture, but I felt compelled to find something better. I tried KMS hairplay sea salt spray and have been using it ever since... nice texture, nice smell, not sticky at all,and the price is much more affordable - it runs about $11 for 6.8oz."
3,Not so hot for the price,"I bought this as a response to the John Frieda Ocean Waves being discontinued. It was four times the price and not as good. Like the Brilliant Brunette, it makes your hair more greasy and less separated than the original Ocean Waves. Bring back Ocean Waves! How do we do that?"
1,Unnecessary,"I'm usually a big fan of this brand, but this product is a big rip-off. Not only is it the same as any cheaper beach wave product, but you can make it at home for free.Just mix 1/4 cup water with a tablespoon of epsom salt and a splash or olive oil in a spray bottle. Mix. Spritz."
1,THIS IS NOT A NEW LAURYN HILL ALBUM,This is not a new Lauryn Hill release. The other reviews on here are from 7 years ago. THIS IS NOT A NEW LAURYN HILL ALBUM.
5,At Last!,"I can't believe this hasn't been done sooner! I haven't been able to put the book down. I never liked writing exercises before, but now I'm filling my notebook! This book reveals the hard work that goes into being not just a successful writer, but an effective one. I recommend it to ANY author who wants to improve her craft. I also think that it would be wonderful to use as a text in creative writing courses. Jewell Parker Rhodes is not only a master of the craft of fiction, she is also a master teacher."
4,Simply Amazing......,"This book is incredible! There are so many outstanding examples of exceptional works by African-American writers. I am anxiously waiting for the December 2001 release of Ms. Parker-Rhodes new book, ""The African-American Writer's Guide to Non-Fiction Writing and Publishing."" I'm sure that all of the advice offered in it will be as beneficial and enlightening as the words of encouragement that are espoused in this book!"
2,Sorely disappointed,"I expected this book to help me write MY story. Boy, was I let down! It mostly contains writing exercises about random topics and extensive excerpts from prominent African-American writers. At least the excerpts led me to some works new to me. I found the African American Guide to Writing Nonfiction by Jewell Parker Rhodes to be a much better book to help the writer tell her story, even a fictional one."
3,In the Dark,"I am a school teacher, and this screen really does its job: no one can see what is on your screen. At times, not even I! Yes, I have the screen st up at its brightest. The problem is probably that I sit with my back to an outside window, and the screen gets lots of natural light. I have seen the same screen working under indoor light and it is better, though not as bright as you would need it if your eyes are past their 50+ birthday. Not one of the young women working at my school complain about this. It is a wonderful device, and I do use it, but I can't wait to take it down when I am by myself."
1,"Product works but..., Installagion Method Sucks...!!! Plain and Simple...","This product works as advertised, for security purposes it is a good item, but here is my complaint... #1 The installation method are taped to the screen and then the sheet slides into the little things on the side and the bottom. #2 Any laptop that is 17"" or any other side, has about half of an inch to the sides of the laptop, if the size of this item were a just a little bit more than 17"" than the taped that holds it togueter wouldn't be a problem for me, but the filter is cut at exactly 17"" or whatever your size may be. This means that the little tape thing that holds the filter toguether will be on the way of your screen. If it was around half of an inch over all arround I wouldn't have a complaint about it. And, for the price... in my opinion it's not worth the money... go and get a roll of tint and make your own..."
1,"Screen is great, mounting tabs are terrible. Do not buy.","I'll keep this short - the actual filter works fantastic. It fits my 17"" Macbook Pro perfectly and does exactly what it's supposed to do. Unfortunately, the cheap plastic stick-on tabs that they expect you to mount the filter with are awful - they don't adhere well at all to my screen, and I constantly have to restick/adjust them every time I open/close the laptop.It does what it's supposed to do, but I wouldn't recommend it due to the terrible design of the mounting stickers.A month or two later, and it's in the trash. Tabs are junk, filter doesn't fit newer Dell laptops. Useless and overpriced."
2,Not as good as featured,"Too dark straight on and too much can be seen except in extreme angles. Also falls off the little tabs on wide screen laptops. Small stick-on tabs do not hold it in place very well because the plastic sheet is thick and heavy, thus folding away from the screen in the middle and falling through. I had to add additional tabs at the top as well to prevent this and made removing it annoying. So either you install more than enough tabs and live with it or install as suggested and it may fall off when you close the lid. I also suggest getting the more expensive GOLD reflective model, it seems to work better for ""lookie-loos"". Since these are expensive, might as well get the better one at a slight more cost."
4,3M Privacy Filter,"Excellent product, it definately does it's job as far as keeping rubberneckers at bay. The one gripe that I have is that it IS flexable and tends to want to fall out of the framing that holds it to the monitor when I close my laptop. This can be a pain especially when you move pack up and move the computer on a regular basis."
2,Awful transfer - is this a bootleg?,"The actual film is very good, but the transfer on this DVD is rather horrible. The original source appears to have been a somewhat worn 16mm print with scratches and dirt that apparent then was copied onto VHS tape. Was this taped off the air? Visual artifacts are everywhere and there is poor resolution and muffled sound. The actual DVD is a DVD-R and there are no menus or chapter stops of any kind. No copyright notice either, although I do not think this film is in the public domain. The product description is what is printed on the back cover, with the incomplete sentence the same. It simply stops abruptly. Synergy Entertainment seems to be located in someone's bedroom, with this DVD-R produced in small numbers. This is the full 110 minute original release, it has that in its favor as the PAL copy available in the UK is the American cut version."
5,Human strength of mind prevails life's misfortunes,"It is widely said that our utmost abilities, mental and physical, surface in extreme conditions. By definition, war is an extreme condition predicament. Let alone war in the frozen lands of the Russian (then Soviet) plains. One man and his will against all odds... The achievement and prevail of human spirit against life's little games.... Makes a man wonder when not to smile, when to complain, what to think as impossible. I guess impossible is just something we just don't want bad enough as Kazantzakis put it... Recommendable to all... Enjoy every page; I know I did..."
4,Simple to intermediate projects for all seasons.,Quilts for All Seasons is a book with projects for the whole year. The projects range from quilts to garments and table coverings to wall hangings. The projects range from easy to intermediate. Patterns to scale are included for evey design with seam allowances included as well. Full color pictures are available for every design.
3,a couple of nice quilts in here,"This book is a bit outdated, but there are still a couple of nice quilts (provided you use better fabrics). I made the turtle quilt for my niece out of lovely pastel batiks and tie-dyes and it turned out really well."
1,Olympus P-L100 Paper,"Wrong paper size for my application. Did not realize there were two paper sizes for this machine. Ordered two boxes and did not open shipment until past 30 day return window. Print Pack ""P-L100"" appeared when searching for P-10 series printer paper. Did not know that was smaller paper than what I had purchased previously. My fault for not reading the tiny print."
1,Doesn't Tolerate Weather,"I bought two of these to illuminate my front door so I could see the keyhole at night. They worked for less than a week but glowed only brightly enough so I could see the lamps, providing no light to the doorway at all. Then it turned cool, down to the 40's, and the lamps never worked after that. They're worthless here in SD, but I'll give them to someone in a warmer climate if they're repairable."
3,Second time's a charm (I think),"I ordered one as a gift, and it had a short in it, and wouldn't even charge. Amazon replaced it with no questions asked - the second one is holding a charge, and my sister loves it. It isn't meant to give off a lot of light - it's more for decoration. The lamp housing is beautiful (her's is copper). I'm thinking of getting one for my garden arbor, but will wait to make sure hers works for more than a month before I order mine."
3,Works as expected....,Works OK. However the trunk button only works sometimes.Also it is used and it looks it.Does what I expected it to do.
3,Not for Devil Dogs : ),"My Grand-Puppies love this item and can chew on it for months at a time. My daughters keep them on-hand. BUT, if you have a devil-dog like mine....don't bother. He can destroy it in 15 minutes. I can only give him racket balls or Kong toys."
1,Not so indestructable after all,"I was extatic to hear from my sister that there were toys on the market that could handle the riggors of anything a dog could pull it through.So I immediately ordered this along w/ the alligator because all my english setter's toys were destroyed. Once they came in the mail, I couldn't help but say to her to, ""Try these on for size!"" Literally within an HOUR, though, my setter already had a gaping hole torn in its side and the squeaker pulled out and left in shambles."
2,marginally helpful,"If you are primarily searching for a location and watching a budget, this book will only be marginally helpful. No prices are mentioned here. This book gives capacity info and a general description and that's about it. It's skinny format is difficult to use for such a thick book. And the middle section with a condesed profile in table format of all locations is paginated wrong or something. The left and right pages of the spread did not correspond and it was supposed to be a table format. Extremely frustrating!"
3,INFORMATION ON DISC.,"THIS CD IS FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE, 1995.ARTISTS INCLUDE: LEE RITENOUR & LARRY CARLTON, JOE HENDERSON,DAVID SANBORN, BILLY JOE WALKER JR., DAVE BRUBECK, JAZZ ATTHE MOVIES BAND & STRINGS, JOHN PATITUCCI, THE LYNNE ARRIALE TRIO, PHYLLIS HORNE, HENRY THREADGILL.TEN TRACKS."
1,would give it negative stars if possible!,"The writer is extremely one sided and inaccurate in his portrayal of various presidents' moral substance. One of the worst portrayals is Jackson. He believes that he was moral because he read the Bible daily and was against big government. He doesn't believe Jackson's Indian policy (Trail of Tears among other incidences)should be held against him. In fact, he even puts some of the blame for the Trail of Tears on the Cherokee. The entire book contained similar rewriting of history. Hopefully no one will read his book, and if they do, won't believe his ""history""."
5,one of the best in eschatology comparitive reviews,"Comprehensive, worth the read.Amillennialism Today is the condensed version, why not read the original?Readers will also find The Basis of Millennial Faith by Rev. Floyd E. Hamilton another good primer if you can find it!"
3,"I'm a Metheny fan, but I just don't ""get it""","This one doesn't DO IT for me like BEYOND THE MISSOURI SKY or some earler Metheny CD's. Can't really say why.It's almost too busy or something.I've been listening at work, which is probably not the best place, but I found myself distracted rather than pleased with the tunes.I'll keep buying Metheny because I love his style, but this one missed the mark with me."
3,One Quiet Night-Pat Metheny,Very relaxing album. Heard a few songs off of Pats Website radio so I picked it up.
5,At last ...,"Having been a Metheny fan for the last 15 years and having listened to his other stuff like the ""Solo (More Travels)"" and ""Goin' Ahead,"" I almost always expected him to turn out a work of this sort. And now that it is finally out, it is really a delight to listen to. The only downside of the album is that since it is entirely recorded using the same baritone guitar and tuning, its thoughtful and meditative mood can get a little monotonous for some listeners as you proceed down the tracks in one sitting. But if you can avoid this by playing only a few tracks at a time, it is just sheer listening pleasure. The guitar sound is exquisite and the compositions blend into one another like different chapters from the same book. I have had this album for the last two years and still love listening to it."
3,Some amazing parts but underdeveloped and redundant as well,"As always, Metheny's technical prowess never ceases to amaze, and with this unique venture into solo acoustic introspective mode, fans are treated to another side and music lover's are treated to another language in which jazz guitar may speak. That language, however, becomes rather limited and somewhat rambling as an album whole, despite each track holding promise in some regard."
2,Boring...,One of my all time favorite CDs is 'Beyond the Missouri Ski' by Haden and Matheny. Have seen Pat in concert and in my opinion he is very patchy - 'The Sound of Noise' for example. I was VERY disappointed in this unimaginative CD from a high calibre and outstanding guitarist.
2,"NOT BAD, BUT > > >","Please, for your own good just try to imagine that it is not your leader ""Pat the almighty"" playing -if you can- you will hear it for what it is and will only give it 2 or 3 stars."
2,really not that good,"metheny is a genius and perhaps one of the best musicians alive today . . . but- this sound like that guy on the corner aimlessly strumming chords for fifty-cent tips-honestly. no offense pat, your still my favorite.-(still life, trio stuff, etc.)"
2,One Quiet Night Not So Quiet,"I heard a cut from this CD on XMRadio and loved it. Unfortunately, the CD, when played at home, was filled with squeaky, squacky sounds, drawing attention away from the beautiful songs."
4,"Not typical Metheny, but very listenable","I was surprised at how many positive reviews this CD has received. I like anything Pat does, no matter what style or genre. But this CD is quite a departure. It has a very pleasant, comforting ""background music"" quality. I know, probably not what Pat what shooting for, but I like it nevertheless."
3,"Good, but not up to Pat's standards.","This isn't a bad album. The precision and skill with which Pat plays the guitar is, as always, flawless. The mood it sets is nice. Nevertheless, it's nothing worth spending $14 on. It's one of those albums that is so forgettable that even though I've listened to it at least ten times, I still feel like I've never heard it. Not that I'm against mellow music. But there's really nothing to wrap your mind around on this one, which is supremely odd for an artist like Pat Metheny.If you're looking for a great Pat Metheny solo guitar album, most of which is as mellow as this one, get New Chautauqua. Sure, he uses a multi-track recorder rather than one guitar, but the music is breathtaking and memorable. If you have that, get one of his many Pat Metheny Group albums. Or maybe some Windham Hill. But, although the experience of listening to this album isn't unpleasant, it isn't special enough to be worth buying over his other superior work."
4,+ 1/2 stars...Pat Metheny Unplugged,"What a thoroughly satisfying album! This is one of the jazz world's finest musicians playing solo baritone guitar on mostly original material. Two of the covers are--in Metheny's words--""a couple of my all-time favorite songs"": Keith Jarrett's ""My Song"" and the Gerry and the Pacemakers ballad ""Ferry Cross the Mersey."" The third cover is a loving treatment of Norah Jones' recent hit, ""Don't Know Why."" There's nothing flashy about Metheny's arrangements here. His playing is subdued, yet entrancing. In his liner notes he writes, ""I hope this documentation of those moments will offer some peace and enjoyment."" He scores highly on both counts. [Total Running Time: 65:43] HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
1,I love the Guy,"but ... I have Pat with Joshua Redman , Gary Burton , Chick Corea , Dave Holland , Charlie Haden , Gonzalo Rubalcaba , Michael Brecker , Herbie Hancock , Jack DeJohnette , even with James Taylor ... All of it Fantastic Stuff 4 the most part ... with his Band and Solo , but this is His Low Point as a recording Musician ... Pretty Lame ... No Soul 2 It ... Sorry Pat ... No Good ..."
1,delusions,metheny is in a place where he can do anything and people will say it is great. this album is boring and the norah jones thing is a bit hoky.
1,What's with this guy,"Metheny is one of these players that I've been listening to for years now and I just don't get all the hype. I know he can play but I'm always left feeling a little empty. This record is bland and trite. People keep talking about what a genius he is, so I'll keep waiting to hear signs of this."
1,Pat Methany's got nothing over Kenny G,"I heard this album with the amazing guitarist Michael Gulezian. After much listening, I realised that Kenny G can melt Methany in everything musical. This album is ultra fine boring."
2,Just don't get it,"I am a huge PM fan and I love ""Beyond the Missouri Sky""(5 stars to me), but I tell ya I just don't get this. This just seems boring, uninspired with the boom(thumb), deet(chord), deet(chord), deet(chord) motif throughout. I read the other reviews and I wish I could experience what the others were raving about. I have listened to the entire CD about 10 to 20 times. I own every release with PM's name and many others where he is a sideman or contributer, but this one I would not recommend buying."
5,Green Pajama magic.,"This Seattle outfit are one of modern pop's finest creative forces. Built around the songcraft of Jeff Kelly, which is a good foundation to build some pop magic on. Probably too intelligent, inventive, and normal looking to break through to the masses, but if there's an atom of you that's still interested in music instead of image, you owe it to yourself to check out this band. On a par with the better work of: XTC, the Sneetches, the Beatles, Peter Blegvad, the Bevis Frond, the Kinks, or the Zombies while sounding like none of them directly, they come from a similar prime 60's infused melodic folk psychedelic soundbase but are quite here and now, alive and well, writing fresh accessible heartfelt non-smarmy great modern pop music that's more than worthwhile. DREAM Magazine"
4,Fun read,"The book is emotional, fun, and sexy. The characters seem real and vibrant. While the story line does not always feel historically believable I found it didn't matter as I became immersed in the unfolding angst and drama of the story."
5,just perfect,"I do love this author. Her books, her literary style are just incredible. I think I can't say anything else."
4,My First LK,"I love reading and finding a new author I could enjoy. With all the other reviews I have nothing to add except, to say, I have a new author. The only thing that tickles my brain is, could all this actually take place in 1836? I would think in the 1880's but the publishing house and the fact that Amanda could write and be published under her own name and not a man's name doesn't seem accurate. Nor do the numbers of books claiming to be put out in short order. I am not a stickler for these things but just found myself curious."
5,Wonderful read,"This book captured my interest from the first chapter! The plot, characters, and emotion tied up in this story is just a joy to read. This is a great book to read - please order this book! Historical romance written well!"
4,Very well written,"Really liked this one. Lisa Kleypas is one of the writers who knows how to create likeable characters. I have read many of her books and although I liked ""Dreaming of you"" the best, this one was very good as well. Amanda is a very pragmatic woman and Jack is an ambitious guy. Kleypas creates a very believable story line and you are rooting for them all the way. There is not a part in the book that I felt was unnecessary. Everything they feel is very much in line with who they are. Definitely worth reading"
5,A Sensual Delight,"This book is a true delight. I read it in a day, I could not put it down. It is refreshing to read a historical novel of this period and not have at least on of the characters be part of the aristocracy. I glad to find out that the high middle class and rich merchants, also had fun and balls and maybe more fun than the stuffy aristrocacy. Thank you Ms. Kleypas for this different point of view. Devlin was a delight. I fell in love with him from the beginning. I recommend this novel highly."
3,Not a keeper....,"Did you ever read a book where the author seems to run out of plot and substitutes sex? Which is fine, if you're in the mood for repetetive sex, but not fine if you're in the mood for plot? Kleypas can and has done better. There is little character development and the plot goes nowhere."
3,Hmm...can there be such a thing as too much sex? I'm afraid yes,"This is actually a wonderful story. It is hard to find such a plot among the historicals (younger and WORKING man, independent woman etc), and the main hero Jack is someone that I would not mind for myself. However, I feel that I just read something from the erotica shelf instead of something that belongs to the romance genre.Don't get me wrong, I love sex scenes in my romance novels, but I feel that Lisa finished the book at 3/4 and then went back to draw out all of the sex scenes (and added some more) to get her page quota. After 5 pages of details of who did what and how you want some more emotion, but instead you get the same kind of thing 2 pages ahead.I feel that the book would've been much better if Lisa used more of Jack's (horrible) past to further the plot instead to opting out for the dragged out sex scenes. I guess that too much of a good thing is not necessarily a good thing after all."
2,nothing spectacular,"I used to love this book. But that was before I read Kleypas's other books. This book was all about sex. Sure, the sex was hot, but why does Kleypas have to put sex scenes in every single chapter?! It's as if she was trying to be Susan Johnson. After reading other books by her like Dreaming of You, Then Came You, and Someone to Watch Over Me, I've realized that this book is nowhere near as good as those books. If you have never read Lisa Kleypas's books before, please do not start with this book -- read Dreaming of You first. Lisa Kleypas is such an incredible historical romance writer -- people shouldn't judge her talent just because of one ""bad"" book she wrote."
4,A lot of sexy scenes....,"the epitom of lisa kleypas is ""dreaming of you"" in which the characters make you cry...literally. i cried like hell! also, they were really hot like you could feel the tension. in ths new book by Lisa, we do get the sex and plenty of it, but it lacked the heart wrenching and gut wrenchng pain that we see in dreamng of you. if you want a hot book and pretty good plot then thi is it. i should of gave it three stars but i really liked the sexy scenes. very explicit and well done. i would prefer more tears when i read her next book...hopefully."
1,This made the best seller list?,"Apparently Ms. Kleypas has a large following, but I do not understand why. I found the book boring. The characters were not well developed, the plot was paper-thin, and there was only enough story to hold together rather trashy sex scenes. Anyone who enjoys the well crafted stories of Madeline Hunter, Susan King or Mary Jo Putney should pass this one by!."
1,Really going nowhere,"I have read a few of Lisa Kleypa's book and was really looking forward in digging in to this one. Initially i thought the book started of great with Amanda hiring a prostitute and with Jack or was it john (typo error???) playing along with the charade. but after the 3rd chapeter i just felt the book started to lack direction.. there was no plot, no moral to the story and yes i have to agree some of the sex scenes where inadaquently placed. I didnt laugh or cry i didnt feel any type of suspense which is unusual of Lisa Klepyas to not put in. I also didnt feel as though Jacks Love was sincere to me it all seemed like lust all the way to the end. And Amanda.. welll... she had her good moments.Overall i guess its a story you can read if you wanna waste a few hours.. days.. but i wouldnt buy it and keep it on my shelf.Sorry Lisa.. but i will continue reading your stories you have written much much better!!"
4,Cheesy but still a very nice read,"- All the chichees used here fit very well together or are beautifully merged into context.- This book had a good beginning. It doesn't even matter that the chemistry fades, even with all the inserted sex scenes and the hero's yumminess.- The second half is still written in the beautiful, to the point, interesting and sensual Kleypas way but it feels like a looong epilogue added to assure us they are happy together forever.I agree with 95% of the reviews from Amazon. Even the negative ones are right and to the point but if compared with what you find in the historical romance department you'll find this book to be way above average."
2,Very disappointed,"I cannot believe that I disagree with all the other reviews. I have read all of Lisa's books and I was particularly disappointed in this one. If she said one more time about how plain and chubby Amanda thought she was, I felt like pulling my hair out. Miss Kleypas' older novels such as Love Come To Me or Where Passion Leads are much better. I found this book totally boring, sorry guys, and could just about give it 2 stars."
2,Did I like it????,"I just finished this book and i don't really know if I liked the book overall. The book is too shallow, the story is just so so. There is nothing really exciting about the book. This is the first Lisa Kleypas book that I've read and I really rely in the ratings of the readers of course depending on the story also before I buy a book. This book have a good rating and definitely have a nice start to the story but after reading it, I am not having second thoughts about her books. I have other books of Lisa Kleypas and now I am hesitating to read them."
3,Could have been better,"This book started out with a lot of promise. I liked both hero and heroine immediately, and I was intrigued by the relatively original premise. Unfortunately, about halfway through, it started to go downhill.All character development went out the window, and minor plot details were tossed about willy-nilly. E.g., In the beginning of the book, much is made of the fact that Amanda is always cold; suddenly we hear no more about it. (there's another thing I could cite but won't because it gives away a key plot point!)Also, although I liked Jack and enjoyed the fact that he wasn't just another nobleman-with-a-heart-of-gold, sex seemed to be his answer to everything. Fight with Amanda? Make-up sex! Problems with the publishing house? Sex! Amanda's feeling sad/ugly/ill? Sex! Sure, this is a romance novel, but what about a little intellectual romance, too?I enjoy Lisa Kleypas' work and her unique take on the romance novel, but I thought she could have made this one so much better."
4,Intriguing......,The most fascinating thing about this novel is that the guy is younger than the girl. I mean it's one of the fantasies for an older women to marry a younger man. I kind of thought the problems between the two lovers were not strong enough for to keep them apart for so long.
4,Hot!!!!,"It's no secret that I am a Lisa Kleypas ""groupie""! She really is one of romances best authors. Her hero's are men that exist only in your dreams and her plots are often rich with originality, and her love scenes...let's just say that until you've read a Kleypas love scene....you are missing something big!Jack Devlin is another one of Kleypas's dream man heroes. He is a self-made man, had overcome much adversity and mistreatment, and now has set his sights on our heroine Amanda Briars.I wish I liked Amanda more. She had all the potential in the world...talent, a strong sense of self, and courage. The romance between these two was predictable at best and tiresome at worst. The love scenes in this book are it's saving grace. I think this is one of her most sensuous stories that I've read...and that is saying something.Overall a solid 4 star read, but not up to her 5 star reads like (Dreaming of You, Devil in Winter, and Lady Sophia's Lover)"
4,Suddenly You,"This book was quite a delightful little read. Not a ton of plot to tie it all together, but Jack Devlin is a delicious hero and there are plenty of steamy scenes. I wasn't totally in love with the ending. It seemed a little rushed and squeezed in. There were some parts of the plots I felt could have been developed a little better. If you're looking for something deep and meaningful, this isn't for you. But, as I said, I liked it and was glad to read Jack and Amanda's juicy story."
2,Suddenly You,I liked both heroine and hero in this story but never really cared about them. The story did kind of amble along with no real purpose but it was still somewhat entertaining. Amanda constantly moaning about not being attractive was a bit repetitive and annoying. I felt that she was constantly fishing for compliments. The ending was very weak. They seemed to have lost their chemistry by the end despite all the sex.
2,NOT A KEEPER....,"I generally enjoy Kleypas' work, but I thought that her last two books were very flat. In ""Suddenly You"" the sex scenes were steamy, but the characters were so flat and the storyline was so bland that I didn't have a whole lot of interest in finishing the book. The chubby heroine and her fairly younger man theme got quite tiresome. The last books that I did enjoy from Kleypas was ""Dreaming of You"" and ""Someone To Watch Over Me."" You can save your money and take a pass on this book."
4,This was very nearly 5 stars...I really liked it!,"It was sexy, romantic, and original. I could have done without the anal play and raspberry scene towards the end of the book, but maybe that's just me.:)I would highly recommend this book to any romance reader."
3,KLEYPAS LIGHT,"While not her best book, this one is still worth the effort. It is more light hearted than her previous books with minimum angst. Her characters aren't quite as developed as her previous novels but sometimes you want a book you can speed through and not feel washed out emotionally when you finish. Two other books which I read right after this one and enjoyed more are Elizabeth Thornton's ""Princess Charming"" and Karyn Monk's ""The Prisoner."" More angst, more character development and better plot."
2,Where's the story line?,"This was my first Lisa Kleypas book, and I'm not sure that I'll be seeking out another one. The plot of this story was missing, and in its stead was too much panting and kissing. The character development was non-existant as well-- I could have cared less what happened to either of them. In fact, the only character I liked was Uncle Hartley, but he had almost no role in the story. I would have appreciated fewer intimate scenes in place of a story line that held my attention. I repeatedly put the book down and had to force myself through the end of it."
3,It was and okay book,"Its was an okay book. Personally i like more drama, or more heartbreak. Though it was quite interesting =]"
2,"ugh, not a winner for me","Sorry. As much as I love MOST of Lisa Kleypas' books, this one is awful. I personally found it impossible to like Jack at all. And the sex scenes were positively cringeworthy; what is sexy about a man inserting fruit into your vajayjay? Nothing at all. Horrible story; none of it made sense and none of it was sexy or romantic. Wow, I can't even believe this mess came from the mind of my favorite romance novelist. Truly disappointing. There was not a single likeable person anywhere in the book. Yuck. Save your dough and pass on this one."
3,This one is difficult to review,"I gave this book 3 stars because I enjoyed the first half of the book very much and majority of the sex scenes were above other novels. I found it mostly enjoyable. Some of the sexy scenes were incredible.One problem was the constant ""I'm not beautiful and remarks about her having an undesirable body or specifically making it out like she had kankles"". However, my biggest problem was the raspberries.....after their terrible ordeal. It just grossed me out."
1,disappointing,"I loved the initial premise of this book, but toward the end, it dissolved into cliche. I really thought I'd found something new in the romance genre, but alas, it's not this. My first Kleypas, my last Kleypas."
3,A good romance!,"This is one of the few good romances I have read in a long time.Definitely one of Ms Kleypas's more sensual works.Even though the plot and everything was good, I found that the novel was strangely lacking in depth, due to which I enjoyed the book immensely while I was reading it, but after a couple of weeks I realised that nothing in the book was memorable, other than the steamy scenes.Still, all said and done, it was better than some of the boring stuff I have read lately."
4,IRRESISTIBLE,"I have not yet finished reading the book, and I don't know how it will end,but I can't put it down. I can't wait to see how this will end and that is the only reason I would not give it a5 star rating. I just wanted that make sure I told everyone about it."
5,Suddenly You,"Once again Lisa Kleypas does a wonderful job of creating a romantic, erotic, moving story. She never dissapoints!!"
4,Fast paced Victorian read.,"Amanda Briars is still a virgin, and her thirtieth birthday is rapidly approaching. So Amanda, a popular author, does the unthinkable-- she goes to a madam and hires a man so that she will know physical love at least once. When sexy Jack comes to her door, she assumes he is the man for hire. She tries to send him away, but he gives her a little pleasure before he leaves.... Not long after this, Amanda meets Jack at a party and finds out, to her horror, that Jack is really John T. Devlin, publishing mogul and purveyor of scandalous literature. Amanda thinks he's a repulsive person, but Jack has just acquired Amanda's unpublished first novel. He wishes to publish it, but it requires editingShe feels she is dealing with the devil but agrees to the contract. Her passions get the better of her, too, and they begin an affair. This is a fast-flying novel with snappy dialogue, a most sympathetic heroine, and blazing, often unusual love scenes. A delightful and fun read!"
5,Another Wonder by Lisa Kleypas,"I just adored this book and could hardly put it down. I've loved every book by Lisa Kleypas, and as with every other story, I loved her lead characters, Amanda and Jack, found them perfect for each other, snuck ahead to the end (as I have the bad habit of doing) just to make sure everything would work out, then continued reading this delightful story.No point in describing it because all of the rave reviews ahead of me have already done so quite well. How one person found it boring, I can't even imagine.Lisa is an excellent writer in every way. This one is most definitely a keeper with just the right amount of romance, humor, and sizzling sex scenes. Buy it and you won't be sorry!"
4,Reap the Wind (Wind Dancer Trilogy,The Wind Dancer Trilogy was excellent. Thoroughly enjoyed all 3 books. Liked the stories progression over centuries not just years. Definitely worth a read.
2,"Uh, NO. If you must, read it to finish the trilogy.","I picked up Reap the Wind eagerly, having thoroughly enjoyed the first two books, to complete the trilogy of The Wind Dancer series. I was extremely disappointed in this book. I give it two stars for several reasons. I didn't find a connection to the characters (even though they were more modern than in the other two books). There are pieces of this book that are bawdy and frankly, a turn-off. Not something you look for in a romance novel, historical or not. Not quite sure what happened here. The first two, especially Storm Winds, were great."
1,BORING!!!!!!!!!!,This book is horrible! I'm not sure why it is rated so high. I have not finished the book yet. I am having to force myself to finish it. Thank goodness I am checking this book out from the library and did not buy it.
3,the perfume business,"The world's most coveted ancient art treasure connected to her ancestors drives Caitlan to learn its secret. Mistress of her family's estate in France that grows flowers for the perfume industry, she would go to great lengths to keep it solvent and in the family.Stricken with financial troubles, Caitlan is forced to Alex Karazov's offer to back her new perfume which if successful will enable her estate to be back in the black. A fast moving thriller and absorbing look behind the scenes of the perfume business."
2,LOVE Iris Johansen,"but not crazy about her 'period' pieces. I know this was the 'recursor' to The Wind Dancer, which I loved, but - just not my thing."
2,When will it end.,If this had been the first book by Iris Johnason I had read it would have been the last. I have read many of her books. This one is at the bottom of the pile! It was to long and drawn out. I thought it would never end. Several times I almost didn't finish it but thought it would pick up at some point. I was just boring
3,What's up with the cover?,"Can someone tell me why the White House is featured on the cover? It has absolutely nothing to do with the story. Did the publisher accidentally switch this with a Tom Clancy paperback??Otherwise, a decently plotted adventure marred by some leaden dialogue and that hoary old cliche about people who've concluded ""love doesn't exist"" until the right person inspires them to open their hearts. Yawn."
3,Good but not as good as the preceding two.,"The Wind Dancer series was good. I think the first one, ""The Wind Dancer"" was the best story, and ""Storm Winds"" second best, with this one as third best. I just have to make one comment, something I found very strange in this author's writing. In the last two books of this series, the intimacy between the two main characters contained NO kissing. The author did not speak of kissing during the lust/passion/love scenes. the kissing referred to is a kiss on the forehead, a kiss on the cheek. Why was kissing not included in this author's love scenes in these two books??? It was included in the first book. Very Strange!"
1,Reap the Wind,"I ordered this book on 11/5. As of today, 12/6, I have not received it. Very disappointed. Will never order from this seller again and want a refund!!"
3,not worth the extra $,"I did a side-by-side comparison with a Shure SM58 and the Audix and could not hear any difference, altho I did not use it in a ""live"" situation (used headphones and a high-quality mixer). It definitely had less volume. I can't see paying more than twice as much for the Audix."
5,The possibility of the unknown,"This book was a very insightful look at government funded projects and the danger and chaos that can result from the mishandling of these projects and the hidden agendas that the public is kept in the dark about. It is also a story, like all of his books, about the power of love, hope, and courage that can overcome all obstacles. I have read it 4 times and cried in the same place all 4 times. It's a shame the movies are always so lousy."
5,The Best Book Ever!,"Watchers by Dean Koontz is te best book that I have ever read and that is the truth. Since reading Watchers I have read many other Koontz books (which have also been superb) but none of them were as great as Watchers. The plot cannot be criticized and the characters are loveable. Einstein was a superb character. The relationship between Nora and Travis was fantastic. The way all four of the main human characters (Nora, Travis, Vince and Lem) were brought together due to Einstein was superbly done. This is the best book ever! Even the Outsider character was superbly done. As brutal and violent as it is you still have to feel sorry for it. There are no words fit enough to describe how superb this book really is."
4,Koontz's best,"He may re-work the same idea many times in his different novels (Mr. Murder seemed WAY too much like Hideaway) and use some seriously 2 dimensional characters in many of them, but with Watchers, Dean Koontz tells such an original story with such rich detail that it stands out. It still isn't as deeply layered as some of Stephen King's (not all of King is untouchable, as Cujo sucked) but Koontz really tells a compelling story with Watchers."
2,Definitely NOT his best!!!!!,"I was prompted to read this book only after reading all the rave reviews here. In my opinion this is not one of Dean Koontz's finest efforts. Not nearly as suspenseful as some of his others. However, I have really enjoyed some of his other titles (i.e. Intensity) and will continue to read his work"
2,BLW 2010 Summer Book Club Review,"Dang. Maybe my expectations were too high, because I'm already a DK fan (his Frankenstein was awesome) and I know that Watchers is one of his most acclaimed works. Regardless, I just couldn't get into this one. I kept expecting edge-of-your-seat suspense, but I found my mind wandering as I read descriptions of wooded areas and such. I finally couldn't bring myself to pick the book back up after 50 pages, so I decided to give up. I'm pretty sure the fault here is mine - I am so easily bored, and perhaps I didn't have the patience to wade through the details to get to the meat of the story. But I did give up nonetheless, so the best I can rate this book is two stars. Sorry Mr. Koontz - please don't send any monsters after me!"
3,Pretty Good,"This was decent but avoid ""By the Light of the Moon"". It was comic book level for children but not acknowkledged as such."
3,Travis nearly killed me,"Travis, the character that finds the dog, nearly killed me. After reading that everyone that gets to know him dies horribly, I decided it is best to stay away from him. Besides, his traumas grew humorous as they piled dead-body on dead-body.Maybe I am too fearful, but reading about him made me scared I too might get jinxed."
3,Couldn't get past the premise,"My own bias, but I could not get past the hyper-intelligent dog premise that drives the book. When the dog started reading books I simply could no longer suspend my disbelief and rolled my eyes in exasperation. The idea of a golden retreiver sitting back on the couch with a good book was just too much.Koontz achieves exactly what he wants to do in this book. The characters are sympathetic and in need of change. The villian is truly evil and relentless. The climax is logical and emotional (sort of).If you like Koontz other books, you'll probably enjoy this. I know this is a very personal book for Koontz, who loves his dogs like children. But a novel reading dog? I just couldn't get past it."
1,B-Movie Book,"First of all, I am astounded at the five-star ratings for this novel. It was like reading a screenplay for a made-for-TV movie for the USA Network. I could expand on my criticism for the book, but its taken up enough of my time already. No point in letting it waste more. Readers, be warned: Not everybody found ""Watchers"" to be a five-star read."
5,First of many Koontz books I have read,"This is the first Koontz book I have ever read and he has me hooked now. Amazing book and at this time the best book I have ever read, bar none!!! I am a bit worried that no other Koontz book will live up to the this one - characters all had their own unique personalities and you care about each one - both the good and evil. A must read for any dog lover."
5,Fantastic read!,"Not many books creates such an emotional response, but this one had me crying, laughing and sitting on the edge of my seat! Can't wait to forget it and read it again, although that might never happen."
3,Liked it Didn't love it,"Perhaps I was expecting too much after having read so much effusive praise from reviewers and the author's own comments but I must admit I only liked this book I enjoyed the themes and found many nice turns of phrase,however, I found the plot to be fairly predictable and the characters to be one dimensional good/bad guys It wasn't an unpleasant way to spend a few hours, just not as memorable an experience as I had been expecting"
5,THE BEST KOONTZ BOOK EVER!,"This books starts out like many of Dean Koontz books, but it builds and sucks you in very quickly, and almost dares you to try to put it down: I couldn't! Koontz's ability to develop personalities of his characters - both human and canine - just sucks you in. By the time you finish it, you feel you've lost a close friend, simply because the book is over. If you read any Koontz book, make this one the top of your list!"
4,First Time Koontz Reader on Watchers,"The title of this short review says it all really. I just finished reading Watchers last night and, though it is the first Dean R. Koontz novel I've ever read, it has definitely put me on track to read more of his work.The writing style is smooth, flows very naturally, and has all the pace and intrigue you'd expect from a bestseller. The characters are likable and detestable exactly when and how they're supposed to be, and I guarantee that, if you've any humanity in you, you'll care a hell of a lot about Einstein before you're even halfway through the book.Some elements seem a little convenient (like Travis having served in Delta Force - how many elite special forces guys have you met? Probably not even one, right?), but, if you can look past these occasional bits and pieces, you'll find a tale that will keep you awake and reading long after the bedside lamp should have been switched off.Enjoy!"
4,Good....4.5,"I liked this book, the only problem was that I kinda knew what was going to happen around halfway through the book, although I kept on reading. Honestly its a preatty easy read, I read it in a few days. Don't expect anything out of this world, but you'll still find it enjoyable. The dog is so cute, I want one. This is in my top 5 list of ""fun"" books to read."
4,Great listening while driving,"This book portrays the positive and negative effects of what happens when Man plays god. The flow was great, somewhat predictable, but very entertaining. A future with dogs nearly as smart as man would be very interesting indeed."
5,One of the best books I have ever read!,"I happened to come across Watchers when it was mentioned in an issue of DogFancy. It seemed interesting enough, so I bought it. I never realized that it would be this good! I'm only 17, but I've read plenty of books, and by far Watchers is one of the best. The story got me hooked right from the beginning. The suspense in this novel is amazing. I was at the edge of my seat throughout the whole thing. Koontz does an excellent job making each character unique and I've become so attached to the main characters. I definitely recommend Watchers to anyone who loves a good book. Whenever I finish a chapter, I can't put the book down and end up staying up as late as I can reading it. The action, romance, mystery, and suspense is enough to give this book 10 stars, though I can only give it a 5."
5,The best novel about heart-touching friendships,"A book about friendship between a dog and a man (and a woman). Very emotianal, yet thrilling. Action packed horror.Stephen Serto"
5,Koontz rates #1 again!,"I love reading well written, satire and this guy does a great job of that- and scares the ""pants off"" at times. Mainly it's great writing because it's so ""real"" and might happen in our world at any given time. We just never know who/what might be living downthe street or...right next door! Koontz keeps one wanting to read, ""just one more page"" that turns into chapters before you realizeit's after 1:pm and that alarm will be going off in a few more hours! Love his books, and own several now that ""Santa"" brought me aKindle! It would be difficult to choose just one ""favorite"".Mrs J.W. Berry-HillSo. California desert-""kangaroo rat"""
5,One of my favorites.,"I love this book and Lightening by Dean Koontz the most, but I've enjoyed all of his books that I've read. Though a few of them were not subjects that I cared to read about. I have been reading the 1 star reviews of this book, there aren't many, but they are pretty entertaining and some are hilarious. Everybody has an opinion of course, and in mine, this is one of Koontz' best."
5,He terrorizes you with real life.,"The reason I am such a diehard Koontz fan is that he can take the ordinary daily routines in life and create something that will absolutely terrorize you. He does not reach into a parallel universe or develop some unimaginable creature. Instead, he uses the characters that would surround you in your daily activities. To me, that is much more terrifying that a spaceship or a genetically altered, mutant space creature. The Koontz style is total psychological terror instead of slice N dice, blood and gore.I have most of Koontz' books and have yet to be disappointed by one. They are all stories that I enjoy reading over and over. It seems that I pick up different details with each reading.Get this book and see what I mean. It will make you look over your shoulder! Before you see the movie, read the book. It will make you enjoy the movie much more. I am glad to see movies from the Koontz books. Check out ""Sole Survivor."""
5,Awesome,Well worth the buy. I am grateful for the rave reviews. I love the start of Dean Koontz's career. He was so good back then.
5,Good Reading,WatchersThis is a great piece of reading material. The book was one to pull you in and then hold you in.The condition of this item was just as stated. Very happy with this item.
5,One of the best books I have read.,"I have over three thousand books both fiction and non fiction, this is one out of five of my favorites. Imaginative with a great story line. I have purchased an additional copy to loan out to friends."
5,My favorite Dean Koontz book!!!,"I just loved this book. It was exciting and scary. It made me laugh and cry. My favorite part is where Einstein is spelling with the dominoes and says that if he leaves his people he will die. The woman takes this literally and begs him to stay. He tells her if he leaves he will ""Die of Lonely"". I needed a mop to wipe up after that scene. Loved this book!!!!"
5,"If you miss reading this one, shame on you!","I loved this book. Could not put it down from the first page. Loved the characters, especially the dog & the way the relationships developed. This book has something for everyone and I love the way Koontz was able to make the reader empathetic with the ""bad creature"". The scene where ""it"" was about to be killed in the barn was heartstopping and heartwrenching. I laughed, I cried, I was terrified. This is my second favorite Koontz book and I have read them all. Don't miss this one!"
5,this is the best book i've read,watchers is a very good book. This book is all about alot of different people talking about thier life and what goes on in it. Its kinda strange but its really good because strangeness makes a good book. I like what happenes in each life.
1,Good premise is wasted in Watchers,"This isn't Dean Koontz's worst novel, but it is a runner up. The only major confrontation with the outsider was at the end and it ended quite abruptly. For a much better book of of this type of premise, read Fear Nothing and Seize the Night, second and third best of Koontz's novels behind only Phantoms."
1,Awful!,"This book was awful! Too unbelieveable and corny at the same time. I'm reading about this ""magical golden retriever"", and then happen to look on the back cover only to see the author, mr koonz with a golden retriever! I tell you, I was beside myself! This book also likes to use terms that not only offend me as a human being but also just make me horribly mad. The worst of which was ""pregger,"" referring to a pregnant woman. So between this and all of the references to the dog as ""fur face"" I just did not enjoy this book. I don't know why I finished this book, but I'm sorry to say I did."
2,As good as a Dan Brown-novel!,"I first read this book back when I was 14 or 15 and I remember I loved it.In a fit of nostalgia I bought it for my Kindle, am ""30%"" through it, and I actively dislike it! The characters are vacuous, the prose is mediocre, and the plot is like a Dan Brown-novel; zipping from place to place at a hectic pace. Indeed, the last book I actively disliked was also a Dan Brown-novel.Do not buy this book. Unless you like Dan Brown, in which case you probably don't understand any of the words I've just written.It gets two stars, because it's not a Dan Brown-novel, and the lowest rating I can give isn't 0 stars."
2,Classic Koontz...yet again,"Sometimes saying ""classic"" is supposed to mean good things. Not in this case. This is the typical Dean Koontz theme. Bad government labs create mutant good and bad creatures. Overly intelligent dog that somehow is as insightful as humans. It was nice the first two times I read Koontz but frankly he is just too much of a formula writer to be read often. On the rare occassion that he goes beyond this formula it seems ok. Unfortunatly he is pretty much stuck on this theme. God forbid that there were never government labs, Dean would be out of a job."
5,Great story,This is a great story about life and the world in which we live. Koontz has a magnificent way with words and ties together the elements of his novels exquisitely.
5,Timeless favorite,No matter how many times I read this book it always gets me. I will always think that dogs are smarter than we know. Dean Koonts best novel ever.
5,Great book...,I'm actually about half way through the book but its just amazing. I wasn't a fan of the synopsis and truly the only reason I started reading it was for a book club I'm a member of but now I can't put it down :)
5,Watcher's By far his best,When I started Watchers I couldn't put it down. By far the most scariest of all Koontz books. The book that made me a Koontz reader. John
5,The best book Koontz has written.,"I personally consider this book one of Mr. Koontz's best and would recommend it to anyone. While some of it's content is technical, he takes great care to explain it in a way anyone can understand. The characters are endearing and well developed. This is a book that you can read many times and never get tired of."
5,Great,"This is about the 8th Koontz novel I have read and it really was a great book to read. The action keeps you from beginning to end and does not get tiresome. You can basically get an idea what the book is about from above and from other reviews, so I am just going to recommend to read this book if you haven't. If you haven't read Koontz, start with this one. I also highly recommend BY Light of the Moon, and also Tick Tock if you are looking for a more humorous, lighter read."
4,Good Thrill Ride - Nothing New from Koontz,"First off, this is one of the better Koontz novels I've read. It was gripping, fast paced and an extremely good read. If you enjoy Koontz and have not read this one yet, I suggest you give it a run.Sadly, Konntz does not explore any new ground and the typical Koontz formula is applied to Watchers with a different plot and setting. Down and out characters that are going through problematic times, ex-military is usually involved, a character has some kind of supernatural powers, a love interest is always involved - a kind of mutual healing for both characters, good vs. evil.For Koontz' formula, this book works, if you are looking for anything new from Dean, I'm not sure where to direct you."
5,"never fear, Einstein's here","This is by far my favorite Dean Koontz novel. The premise: a laboratory conducting illegal genetic research has produced its two greatest accomplishments- a dog with the intelligence of a human (and he's psychic) and a crazed psychopathic creature with an insatiable appetite for human blood. Both creatures escape; the creature begins his rampage while the dog is picked up by a guy with his own problems in life. It just gets better from there. This novel follows in the vein of Koontz's latest novel Dragon Tears (review to come later) and only displays Koontz's writing prowess. I read this book in about three hours and you probably will, too. Dean Koontz has done it again... written a novel that isn't just a passing fad. Adios and happy reading."
5,GREAT BOOK!,This was the first book I read by Dean R. Koontz. I was totally mesmerized by it - great mystery - thrilling story. Not like the movie infact I was looking forward to the movie and I was disappointed that they did not follow the book. This is a great book!
1,not the whole book,i am very very disappointed this is NOT the whole book i want a refund ....they should tell you its an abridged version
2,A weak premise couldn't hook me from the start.,"The biggest thing with getting someone to believe a fantastical plot premise is ""the hook."" Michael Crichton does this best, he gets to to believe that DNA can be be taken from blood in mosquito's encased in amber, genetically re-engineered into living organisms. Once he's got you hooked on the small details, you're mentally ready to accept humans capering about with dinosaurs in the modern day. Koontz just never established his hook in me and I spent the whole book disbelieving what was on the page.Koontz does a pretty decent job of establishing his characters and this is what kept me reading. His pacing is good, he knows what he's doing as a thriller writer, it was just a case of ""too little too late.""I'm a fan of Dean Koontz, but just couldn't get behind this one. My advice, stick to some of his better works like Intensity or Velocity."
2,An oddly popular Koontz book I didn't like,"Many Koontz fans I know list this book as one of their favorite Koontz novels, but I list it amoung my least favorites.The premise of this book didn't appeal to me, and it just struck me as cartoonish. The book had good build-up, but was anti-climatic.One of the villian characters is quite interesting, however. But, I don't feel he justifies reading the book for. Consider one of Koontz other novels."
2,Clearly not my genre,"I got this book used on audiotape - my first Koontz -- and can listen to almost anything while I am pushing paperwork around the office. My standards are pretty low. I made it through the syrupy opening with the super-clever dog. I didn't mind the pitiable female character who was afraid of her own shadow. But when the serial killer shot a sleeping boy in the head and shuttered with an orgasmic joy, I clicked the tape off and tossed the whole boxed set into the trash. In a world like this, the last thing we need are more inexplicably evil fictional child killers. When I noticed that 500 Koontz fans had rated this novel as top-notch, I got a stomach ache."
5,One of the author's best!,"This is perhaps one of the best books ever written by Koontz. I started the book and could not put it down until I finished it. As a new Koontz reader, I can say that there was no other better book to start with. If you're not already a loyal Koontz fan, I'm almost sure you'll be one once you read it!"
5,I wish my puppy was as smart as Einstein!,"I have read almost every Dean Koontz book, and this is my all-time favorite. I have read & re-read it over the past few years. Highly recommended! A great read. I didn't want to put it down!!"
4,A must-read for animal lovers who love thrillers !!,"The Watchers is one of the few novels that introduces you to many characters and keeps you interested in ALL of them ! The need to find out what happens to the golden retriever and his friends keeps you turning the pages well past the time you should have gone to bed. Even the villain of the book manages to inspire pity rather than hatred. Although at times you wish the author would be a little quicker to get to the ""meat"" of the story, you never get to the point where you actually want to put the book down. If you've never owned a dog, this book will make you wish you did. If you do own a dog, you'll find yourself looking at it in a completely different way. This book is a must-read."
4,Great book,"First let me start by saying this is a book you should read if your are into horror or SiFi. It has one hell of a good villian. The villain is the best part.The next best part of the book, an I know many will thrash me for saying it, is the Sheriff and NSA agent. They really play a major role in my opinion. The retriever, alex and his girlfriend are good but take second place to the above Mentioned.The only thing I didn't like about this book was it was a bit to preachy. Not so much that it ruined it, I just could have used a little less."
2,Cornball tripe,"Koontz can write a compelling novel, but in this one he ""writes down"" to the reader. The major female character is not believable; the romance is corny as the dickens, and the protagonist, Travis Cornell, is not well-developed. The plot is okay, and the monster is pretty monstrous, so I'll give it a 2."
2,A great book - very poorly presented... =(,"I bought this version (as a gift) thinking it would complete my sister's Dean Koontz hardcover collection nicely - when it arrived I nearly died.Its about the size of a mass market paperback, has cheap printing (text isn't even aligned right on the first 50 pages), and a cover that looks like it was scanned off the real thing and printed on a piece of wet cardboard. It felt so bad that I thought I might damage it just by holding it...Sure, go buy the book yeah but not THIS VERSION!"
2,Nothing special,Travis an elite Delta Force fighting machine? Nora a reclusive beauty? Einstein a Retriever with near-human intelligence? Repeated feedings of chocolate to a dog? Come on. This is a goofy effort from a writer who should know better.
3,"An enjoyable read, but a bit too wordy","Although a good read, Koontz could have cut out about 1/4 of the text content to make for a more taut thriller -- one that raced without interruption towards a breathless ending, rather than being sidetracked innumerable times by issues and scenarios that, for the most part, seemed unimportant.I also had a bit of a problem with the ""suspension of disbelief"" that should be part of any sci-fi read. Because the plot setting was so ordinary, I had a hard time convincing myself that the events that played out could have actually happened.Anticipating a blockbuster conclusion, I was sorely disappointed. The book ended with more of a whimper than a bang.Still, I would recommend this as an engaging read, albeit one that stretches the bounds of credulity a bit much."
3,What a weird book,"I barely know how to describe this novel. It contains a Scrabble playing dog, an infanticidal psychopath, and even a deadly mutant baboon. The book changes repeatedly from cute and playful to violent and gruesome, and at one point there's even a graphic sex scene straight out of a cheesy romance novel.Unfortunately all of these quirky elements are held together by Koontz's flat, styleless tone. Although many of the characters are borderline crazy and a few completely insane, they are all utterly predictable. After the first few chapters, it is very apparent what the obligatory climactic showdown must be, and the novel plods steadily towards it.If this book had an interesting style or a decent theme to tie everything together, it would have been a great book. Instead it's just your standard thriller with some of the weirdest random elements you will ever come across."
2,Watchers by Dean Koontz,"If you are fairly intelligent, you won't be very impressed by this book. As others have said, the characters are one-dimensional. The hero is too competent. Koontz is way too klutzy in writing about the hero's relationship with the woman--it will actually make you barf if you've ever known a few real women. The dog and the human stalker are by far the most interesting characters, and they are the reason why you may not be able to put the book down. Koontz does have the ability to make you want to keep reading, and that's why I rate this 2 stars instead of just 1. The story has good flow, but the ending is truly awful: It's way too brief and unsatisfying, and it's far too predictable. What a shame. And I thought, ""this is it? talk about a banal plot!"" So an enraged baboon is on the loose--who cares? Even the title is stupid and undecipherable. The whole book is so underwhelming, except for the dog. The dog deserves a miniseries!"
4,"Not Really Plausible, but Enjoyible none the less","Dean Koontz has the magic ability to take a concept that sounds totally unrealistic, and write it in a way that it sounds like it could actually happen. He managed to do that with this book, making a super-intelligent dog and a perfectly-designed warrior with emotional rage issues entirely believable. The only not entirely enjoyable part of this novel is the hitman that sucks energy from his victims, who is portrayed badly. I reccomend this book to people who enjoy other books by Koontz, especially Mr. Murder. Creature and Guardian, both by John Saul, are also very similar and just as good stories."
2,Not A Koontz Fan,"Koontz fans tell me this is perhaps his best. If that is the case, I am glad I read it first. It will save me the trouble of wasting any more time on the rest of the Koontz offerings. A few great ideas ruined by poor character development and predictable, anti-climatic resolutions. Color me ""not a fan."""
5,Koontz' Best Ever!,"Dean Koontz is my all time favorite author, and though I've read almost all of his novels, Watchers is still my favorite! Not so much for the subject matter but for how he writes it. His characters come to life more than any other author I've read, leaving you to really root for the good guys, and even a dog!Though I rarely reread novels, I am excited to pick this one up again and again after all these years. Koontz knows exactly how to blend suspense and horror with love and compassion for an amazing read that you can't put down!You've got to read this book! It will be your favorite too. I would give it 10 stars if I could!"
5,You'll Read This Again & Again,"This is my favorite Koontz novel. I've read it at lest two dozen times in paperback and now it's on my Kindle. The story is a bit far-fetched but will hook you right in. You will keep rooting for the underdog and Superdog. Once you've read it, don't you dream of having an Einstein of your own?! :)"
5,Great read!,"I chose to give this book a 5 because it is a great story that truly encompasses all that you would look for in a Dean Koontz novel. It was not at all what I was expecting yet met all I was looking for. I can't begin to imagine a sequel even though I long to know what happens to the characters moving forward....but isn't this how all good books end??? With you wanting more, of course!"
3,Disappointing,"One of my favorite authors, but not his best work. I was surprised that Koontz was so proud of this creation."
3,Heartwarming,"Some of his best characters but NOT his best work. Although, it seems this book is one of the closest to Koontz's heart with a wonderful dog named Einstein, it struggles with pacing. Nice story ... just not up to what I expected from Koontz."
5,The Best,"I just finished reading Watchers and I think it was one of the best boks I have read in a very long time. I don't know about the movies, but most directors destroy good books with all there special effects, etc. I loved Mr. Koontz's write-up at the end of the book and I know one day when he is a very old man, still autographing novels Big Foot will be in line waiting to get Mr Koontz's autograph. As for a sequel to this book, I would not recommend one, because it could never compare with the original book. I would not read a sequel to the Watchers. I recommend that everybody read this book. - E. Stein"
5,Great Dog & Nice Couple against the Terrible Mutant.,"""Watchers"" is a great story to be read.Dean Koontz has a superlative genius for depicting scenes with constant and subtle increase of tension. The author with very tiny elements turns a normal engagement, into a hair-raising situation.The dog-human relationship is very dearly depicted and shows Koontz's deep penetration into canine psyche. Every dog-lover person will be seduced by the mutated Golden Retriever that is righteously named ""Einstein"".Even the hideous ""Outsider"" has its own attractive traits.It looks like every reader will be satisfied as the book contains romance, horror, adventure, fantasy, thrill, monster, wonder-dog, psycho-killer, dogged cop, whatever. The whole story is very neatly tied up and keep you running chapter after chapter until the end.It is a book that may be enjoyed by thrillers fans and general public too.Reviewed by Max Yofre."
4,An Engrossing Read!!!,"Watchers brings the childhood ""bogeyman"" to life! An engrossing and terrifying read that nearly kicked me out of my seat!! I could not put this book down. To tell the truth, however, during the parts when Detective Lem and the other policemen were involved, the suspense in the plot took a sudden downfall. I was clearly disappointed, but made it my goal to skip the ""annoying"" parts and finish the book. As a result, the remainder of the novel truly made up for the ""boring"" parts. Koontz has a way of causing the reader to feel sympathy towards the characters. I even felt sorry for The Outsider at times! If you're looking for a suspenseful novel, then Watchers is what you are looking for!!"
5,Possible one of the best books ever written.......,Dont read this book with the door unlocked it scared the pants off of me.Dean Koontz really shows us his writting skills in this novel. This book is a must buy if ur into an action packed horror story.
5,I couldn't put it down!,"This is by far the BEST Dean Koontz I have read thus far. If you have never read a Dean Koontz novel, I suggest you pick this one up. I guarantee you will be hooked! There were so many various and wonderful characters. I especially loved Einstein. Koontz couldn't have picked a better dog (a golden retriever) for that character (unless of course it were a Black Lab) and it was wonderfully played out! Even the Outsider, though representing evil incarnate, made me feel pity and a certain amount of sadness for it. The best part of the book is, it makes you wonder if Science really has advanced that far and could possibly succeed in making a dog as smart as man. It is definitely worth your time!"
3,ok,"it was just an ""ok"" transaction. my book feel apart when i got it but i knew it wasn't in great condition...I just glued it back together."
5,Koontz's best,"I am a HUGE Dean Koontz fan and have every one of his books and this has always been my favorite. The book is brilliant. I am now buying it for my Kindle as well, as it has been a long time since I have read it."
5,His best book EVER,"I loved this story and how Einstein brought Nora and Travis together. I wish he would write a sequel so we can dream about the future possibilities of Einsteins offspring. Come on Dean Koontz, write a sequel, PLEASE!!!"
5,Glad to see this book in print finally,"I had the distinct pleasure of taking Steve Schoen's creative writing class a but back. He had just got the deal for this book to be done, but used early drafts to teach the class (and get reader feedback). Anyone who wishes jump into beginning level story writing will enjoy this. It covers all the bases well, from idea formulating to conventions to writing to an audience. I recommend this heartily."
5,Great reference book! written in words I can understand,"I loved this book! It was easy to read and understand and I was able to reference it according to the sports that I participate in. The material was written in a concise, interesting manner and it was not overly detailed. I especially appreciated the chapter that focuses on chronic conditions that can affect me during various sports, as I have mild arthritis in my neck. The exercises that pertain to this problem have already helped!"
4,Great Book For Sporty Women,"Overall, I liked the positive message of challenging yourself, but being physically prepared every step of way so you don't develop injuries. A book can never replace a doctor visit for serious sports injuries, but this book has great tips for conditioning and getting ready for different sports seasons. I also like some of the helpful hints--such as which shoes to buy for running/walking/hiking, and the diagrams with conditioning stretches. The format of having each chapter be pertaining to a specific sport also made it easy to find what I was looking for. I'll keep this book handy during the sporty-summer months!"
1,WHERE'S TRACK AND FIELD?,i haven't read the book because in the table of contents there is no track?Major ommission. Sprinting is a major sport. It also causes numerous injuries - hamstring and hip tears and pulls.I was going to buy this book for my nieces (15 and 16 yrs) - track stars. I was also interested as i am a sprinter as well.sarah graves
4,very good book,I thing every body should read this book at least once every few years as a reminder... even if we think we know enough about love by now....
2,Can't get into it,"I'm sure it's good, I just can't get into it. I've tried several times and each time I get bored and put it away. Maybe one day I'll get through the whole thing."
3,No Comment,Content was interesting and helpful. But I learned nothing new. May be more suitable for twenty somethings. End of storey.
5,Awesome light show!,"I bought this for my 8 yr old daughter and she loves it!!! The motion, colors and etc is mesmerizing and fun to watch. Plus you can sit back and watch or be in control. What a great find!"
4,What the comic book game has been missing,All your marvel super hero brothas - and then some!Artwork is good - but not as great as a Udon book would be...But still good!
4,Overall a good CD,"I think even people who are not real fans of Cyndi Lauper should give this CD a listen and they may see how talented this woman is. I love a variety of music styles in my collection and Cyndi always satisfies with music from various genres.My favorites on this CD are: Shine, It's Hard to Be Me, Who Let in the Rain?, Eventually, Valentino, and Waters Edge.""Waters Edge"" is particularly stunning and beautifully done. ""It's Hard to Be Me"" is just a fun track (one of my favorite all time songs from Cyndi)Try it for yourself! This is just my opinion and you, the potential buyer, may like other tracks on this CD too."
5,Get it cheaper!,"As everyone here said already, this CD is a must-have for every Cyndi fan. Just try to get it cheaper from Amazon.co.jp. You'll save at least 10 US$ (including shipping), that is, if you understand Japanese or, like me, risk a bit and buy the coverless and commentaryless CD on the japanese site. I was just glad when it arrived and it was the right one! Well, if you were a bit disappointed of ""At Last"" (too many standards CDs there days), buy this. You'll like it."
5,"Love the art ,Love the story",The story is very engaging and the characters are becoming complex as you can get.The art of this manga is awesome .I really like the big volume version.The quality is excellent.My only complain is that it is heavy :D
4,did not order this book,"did not order this book, I ordered Gothic Blue by Portia De Costa by Black Lace. I would recommend it."
3,not my favorite product,"i purchased this product as my stylist recomended it for me. It is ok. I have curly fine hair that tends to be frizzy. This product sounded like a good solution however, it tends to feel heavy on my hair and can sometimes even feel a bit greasy. i have to use it very sparingly even on my frizzy hair. I have noticed that of all the many hair products in my bathroom I dont really find myself reaching for this one too often. In short, it just isnt my favorite product. Maybe it wasnt right for my hair type?"
4,so so.. not a miracle hair product but not bad..,doesn't transform my hair like what others say.. maybe my hair is hopeless (thick/coarse/frizzy/wavy/curly).. it does smell good and softens my hair but in terms of control like flyaways and frizz it didn't provide much hold.. was delivered on time.. overall just so so and a little too pricey for me..
3,Better than...,"I have using this product almost a month.That helps my terribly frizzy hair.However, I have soooooo much hair. Then I use atleast 6 pushes everytime.Almost half bottle of that already gone.Two month a bottle.... Kind of too expensive for me.Also I don't like the smell that like a rose.I will try to find another product.Maybe....BUT if you do not have soooooo much hair I really recommend this!!"
2,Not the product I thought it would be,"After reading other reviews, I was excited to try this product. Though my hair is not long, I have ton of it-it's thick, curly, dry, and porous. (with all these attributes, it is still very healthy-looking.) I wanted the serum because it might relax my curl a bit when I wanted to go for a straighter style. When I first applied the serum, I thought ""wow"", this stuff feels great!"" But as far as actual results--meh. My hair may have felt a bit softer, but that's about it. I'm sorry to say I spent $40 for something that really doesn't do much for--at least not for this curly-girl. The search continues....those with curly hair know what I mean."
2,I don't get it,"I have fine, frizzy wavy/curly hair, that on occasion, I like to wear straight. I purchased this product about a year ago after hearing a lot of great things. I thought it would help with the major case of frizz I get when I trying to blow dry my hair straight. It didn't help. It did, however, make my hair feel very soft.Personally, I don't think this product is worth the cost. A Brazilian Blowout works best for taking out the frizz, but then again, I lose all my curl potential for a couple months. I'm still on the hunt for a great defrizzing serum."
2,It Does What?,"I tried this stuff on my fine hair and it did not work and at $40 clams a bottle, this stuff was a pricey experiment. I tried on it dry, damp, wet... no difference. The flyaways were still flying... Maybe your hair has to be very fine and blonde for it to work. The chic at the salon loved it on herself... I returned the product."
3,Just OK For Me,"I have fine, frizzy hair that is extrememly reactive to the weather, i.e., humidity. I'm looking for a replacement product that Sexy Hair products discontinued. Unforunately, this isn't it. It's just OK for my hair. It did make it smoother but didn't add any texture to my hair to help it hold its shape."
3,Great product,"The Keratase Oleo Relax Serum is great for using with heating products. Although the price leave a little to be desired, you only need a small amount and the bottle generally lasts me for a few months. In addition, scent is beautiful."
4,"Works good, Smells nice","I ordered this product because there were good reviews on different site. My hair has mind of it's own and it's very hard to manage. I used this along with Oleo Shampoo and it makes my hair very manageable. It smells very nice, too."
2,Hello,"Hello,I have tried this prodect before so I bought it for Amazon. I am versy surprised because I do not feel this product has the same qulity of the product that I have bought. I can not camb my hair easily like the time that I used the product that I bought form a salon. My hair is very dry so I will find a product that could help me."
2,Eh...,"I've read the Ramona books with my young cousins, nieces, nephews... pretty much any person related to me under 12. :) I'd recently bought this one, and sat down to read it with them...And throughout the whole book, I was bored. So were the kids, who didn't want me to finish the book. Hearing about Ramona whining because she couldn't get her sheep costume just wasn't the type of Ramona entertainment we were used to. Although we did like the healthy bit in there about smoking, the cons outweigh the pros, unfortunately."
4,Ramona and her Father,"Life is hard being a second grader. Ramona Quimby has just moved from the first, to the second grade. She is a girl who likes school, and is excited for a new challenge. Unfortunately, she gets a few that she'd rather not deal with. Her father looses his job, and it puts the family through a lot. Her mom has to start working full time to earn money for bills, but Ramona and Beezus (her older sister) don't quite understand that. Through reading this story, you'll get some laughs and you'll see the love of two daughters/sisters who are trying to help keep their family together."
5,Beautiful. Fresh. Spiritual. Music as pure as you ever heard before.,"This is a true masterpiece. The artist takes themes from Bach and transforms them in trully original compositions, beeing hard to beleive they are improvisations. They are never boring, always beautiful. She takes one or several Bach themes, puts to work her classical backround, adds some jazz and south american rythms, and comes up with some of the most moving and inspirational music I ever heard. Bravo for Gabriela, this CD is a must for every music lover, classical or not."
4,Lyrical piano takes on traditional Bach,"I heard an interview with this young Venezuelan pianist, Gabriela Montero, on NPR over a year ago, and went to see what CDs she had made. Since I had a classical piano background, this CD appealed to me. Most listeners who are familiar with Bach will find many of his most famous pieces...Montero often plays a traditional version of the piece, and then moves into more contemporary improvisations--often lyrical, always original. She is an outstanding pianist, and I recommend this CD highly."
4,a classical pianist humoring her jazz muse...,"I'm not sure what she's doing to that sofa, but what Gabriela Montero does to J.S. Bach is an appealing hybrid of conservatory training and improvisatory flights of fancy. This isn't on the level of Uri Caine's Goldberg Variations or even Loussier's Play Bach, but it's something entirely different and rarely heard on record -- a classical soloist humoring her jazz muse."
5,Bach improvisations by Gabriela Montero,"Here we have a dozen improvisations by that hugely talented and sensitive Venezuelan pianist, Gabriela Montero, a protégé of Martha Argerich. The ingenuity of her improvisations has to be heard to be believed - always inventive, sometimes even in popular or jazz idiom, but never so ornate as to obscure the original theme. If you enjoy piano music that is fresh and new but on themes composed by J.S. Bach that most listeners will already know, this is a delightful CD, released by EMI in 2006.Gabriela Montero: Chopin Falla Ginastera Granados Liszt Rachmaninov Scriabin [Includes Bonus CD]"
3,Rare look at Garth,This album gives a rare glimpse in the life of Garth Brooks. It doesn't contain the typical side of Garth seen in the states. I would only suggest this album for serious Garth fans. If you are not yet a Garth fan then this is not for you. But if you want to see another side of Garth then get this album.
5,One a few good authors who understand subject well,"My husband needed this for source material in his research. He had a copy of this book some time ago, but lent it to someone and never got it back. I was happy to find it at Amazon.com. He in turn was happy to have it back in his library."
3,Unique.,"The book explores the complex depth and diversity of Roman society. Twelve chapters covering various professions and social strata, from an Anthropological perspective. The omission of female roles was odd and unfortunate. Despite, this huge flaw I give it 3 stars."
3,"Price /shipping good, color not as pictured","As the title suggest, the color is NOT like what is pictured, and am finding true for this brand in general. This one is a much deeper shade in person. Unfortunately I am not going to return it because shipping back is more than the cost of the product itself."
5,Get a Grip,"I had an eye on this system for quite some time and was hesitating because of the expense. Worth every penny, wish I had purchased this sooner. I love the versatility, adaptability and adjustability of the gripper on the router table especially. I am more relaxed knowing my fingers are perfectly safe while I work. In the end, a whole lot less expensive than a trip to the emergency room. And the work is more precisely turned out. This tool is nicely designed and manufactured and better than anything else out there, in my opinion."
2,So So....,"I hate to be the first one to give this book less than 5 stars, but I cannot help it...although it seemed some-what thoroughly researched, it dragged on. I also thought it was kind of hard to follow all the different names the author was constantly giving her.I must agree it is a very sad tale. I bought the book in hopes of getting more actual accounts of Cynthia's life after recapture through the eyes of a cousin in her diaries...I was let down. There was no such thing, even though I saw that statement in another review.I would recommend RIDE THE WIND by LUCIA ST CLAIR ROBSON. It is historical fiction but is well researched & a very knowledgable read about Cynthia Ann, the Comanches, and her life among them. A very beautiful book.This one was not as good as the other viewers made it out to be...sorry."
3,pretty good,"Faint praise, but I like my narrative history to be beautifully written, to tell me things that I never knew, and to open my mind to new ways of seeing the world. For my money, the five line description of Bligh's voyage that appears incidentally in Diana Muir's Bullough's Pond gives us all the essentials. Of course, Muir is in the midst of another story. For all his defense of Bligh and his undoubtedly virtuoso navigational skills, Toohey fails to convince that he was a great leader. The plain fact is that British captains almost routinely led sullen, ill-educated, ill-clad, ill-housed, ill-fed men on nearly unendurable journeys and got them home again without mutiny. Bligh's men rebelled twice. How great a captain can he have been?"
3,Enjoyable reading,"I enjoyed reading this book, and found out many things which I hadn't previously known about the boat trip of some 4200 miles. One cannot help but admire Bligh after reading this account, after all it must take a very strong man indeed to motivate those 18 men who went with him to sail such a distance through starvation and thirst and to keep them motivated for 8 weeks to continue when most men would have resigned themselves to fate.My only disappointment in the book (hence 3 stars)was the lack of content. The book is basically Bligh's reflections after being thrown off the Bounty and some history of his time served under Cook and life after returning home. There is virtually no account of the events leading up to the actual mutiny. Perhaps the author's intention was to concentrate on the journey to Timor. The book itself is therefore quite a short, although enjoyable read, and just perhaps another chapter or two covering the events leading to the mutiny would have sufficed."
4,Pretty Sick...,"I used to own this... but I lost it. I'd like to buy it again because it is pretty good. From what I remember, there is a lot of animal rights content as well as human rights. It is good traditional hardcore, well, not ""traditional,"" but not a lot of metal. It ends with an ""Underdog-like"" reggae song that is pretty good, and begins with a pretty heavy Earth Crisis song. I am not too fond of EC, but this is one of their better songs. One or two of the songs just shouldn't be on there, or even exist. But there are some good ones by Culture, Birthright, Painstake, and others. I would recommend buying it if you haven't already done so. It won't be your best cd, but it will definitely add character to your collection."
4,Good BSB book,"This is a good book and it has good info, some of which I didn't know before, but I think it needed more good pictures. There are some cool pics, but also some dumb ones, so I gave it 4 instead of 5. It has a pic of BSB holding tennis raquets in front of their faces. WHY? I dunno. I guess it's supposed to be funny. Still, I think that any BSB fan would enjoy this. Most likely their official book is better. Maybe you should take a look at that first."
5,Help!,"Hello All! I'm from Germany and I love the song of ""Rudolph""! This song remembers me my childhood-days. Now I'm searching for the text of ""Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer"" and here in Germany i wasn't able to find it yet. Perhaps there's someone in the world who can help me. Many greetings from Germany!Sandra"
4,"5 Star Book, 2 Star Kindle Edition","There's no need to repeat what others have said about the novel. However, the notes at the end of the book are one way links. You can follow links from the notes to the passages, but there are no linked footnotes enabling the reader to reach the notes as the book is read. This is unfortunate because the French and Russian phrases are translated in the notes. But how to reach them? There are also brief explanations about allusions, anagrams, and such. But again, they can only be accessed easily retroactively, after the reader has completed the novel."
2,A serious time consumer,This is the worst book of Nabokov. No 5 star will change this fact. Read it only if you are in prison with this book but no other in the reach of your hand or if you want to see some literary monstrosity.
1,Nabokov amuses himself,"This is a masturbatory fantasy. Nabokov has created his dream world: The United States and Russia are one country and everybody who's anybody speaks French, too; World War I never happened, let alone World War II; and Van Veen has a lifelong love affair with his cousin Ada (actually his sister), full of passion, yearning, intellectual stimulation, and the thrill of the forbidden, plus a soupcon of jealousy provided by Ada's full sister Lucette, who wants Van to love her, too, and finally kills herself for want of him, spicing Van's life with a touch of sweet remorse. Oh - I forgot to mention the voyeuristic lesbianism when Lucette describes her own affair with Ada, and their threesome.If this isn't the stuff of your dreams, you may find Nabokov's mandarin literary style a little heavy for the subject matter, like a g-string made of real cloth of gold."
3,"Boredom, or Boredom","I bought Nabokov's ""Ada, or Ardor"" with the utmost excitement, eagerly anticipating its arrival. Based on other reviews I'd read, I expected a titillating, torrid novel rife with colorful scenes and fascinating characters. The scenes were indeed colorful, and Nabokov's writing style is incomparable. But the actual storyline turned out to be just plain ol' boring! Yes, Nabokov has an interesting writing style, and he challenges the reader by frequently jumping from past to present and intermingling different languages. But I was bored to tears by the less than enchanting Ada, and her equally boring cousin/lover Van, and all the other characters that come and go in their epic. I expected to feel pity for them and their incestuous ""doomed"" love/lust, but I only found myself fed up with their childish ranting and reminiscing. I think Nabokov's ""Lolita"" and even ""Despair"" were better plots."
