5,My son LOVES this toy!,We purchased this toy for my son's first birthday and he LOVES it! He laughs hysterically when the balls pop out while frantically trying to chase the ones that roll on the floor. My husband and I have such a great time hearing him squeal that we start laughing too!
2,Do you want to chase balls everywhere?,"The balls pop out all over the living room when my daughter plays with this toy. So, if you are the type of parent that loves to crawl all over the living room on all fours retrieving balls, then this is the toy for you!"
4,Fun.,"Fun toy, but the balls are easily lost and the top part of the toy does not stay on well. The tunes it plays and sound effects are great. My son enjoys it inspite of it's faults. We'd purchase it again."
5,Lots of fun,My one year old has enjoyed this toy from about six months of age. Loves to grab the balls and the cute music and sounds make it all the more fun!
4,keeps baby busy and moving!,"My 5 month old was terrified initially coz the ball popper made a lot of noise , but she loves it now that she is older by 2 months!!It was hard to assemble coz the sliding blue tube would nt fit well into the base unit and there was an angular gap between the two with the result that the ball would not go back into its original slot and I would have to mechanically push it in each time!!But then, I used some force to push the parts in and wow!!the toy has been working well ever since then!!my daughter loves to watch the balls go round and round and to chase the balls on the floor when they pop out sometimes.provides good visual stimulation for the baby.However, If you live in a small house, beware of losing the balls under your TV stand or couches!!best used in an empty room or in open spaces!!"
4,GREAT Toy But Blower is Too Powerful,"This is the greatest toy. I got it for my son when he was about 9 months and he still plays with it now that he is 18 months. The only thing is that the blower is so powerful that the balls fly completely out of the toy (and onto the floor) and not into the tray to be ""recycled"" back into the chute. I was able to fix this by putting a piece of masking tape over 1/3 of the blower (limiting the air intake). Now it works like a charm. Also, I have seen some people (like my son's daycare) use the popper for other items than just balls. Dropping cotton balls and watching them fly out seems to be popular. This toy is definitely worth the money."
4,Not bad,"My son got one of these for Christmas this year. The sound from the blower freaked him out a little at first, and the balls fly EVERYWHERE which can be somewhat annoying, but other than that it's a pretty cool toy. Maybe they could improve it by giving it a little less air pressure from the blower."
1,Unsafe,"While the toy was turned off, my son stuck his hand in opening to just past his wrist and got his hand stuck. This was horrible. I thought we were going to have to break his hand to get it out."
2,Cute but a big hasel,I received this as a gift for my 12 month old and my first impresion was that it was just too loud. She liked the balls in at first but after losing them and having to check every where for them I prefer to keep this toy out of site. Now at 18 moths she likes to experiment with different blocks and toys that are the right size to see if they fly out too. It seems like way too much work for both parent and child. I wouldn't have bought it.
1,DANGEROUS TOY FOR CURIOUS KIDS,This toy is appropriate for 9 months and up said the Playskool makers. My daughter(currently 18 mths old)and I both liked it until tonight. She was retrieving the balls herself from the tube and got her arm stuck in it all the way up to almost her shoulder. My husband had to quickly retrieve a screwdriver to loosen it while she was screaming in pain and panic. This toy needs to be recalled in my opinion.
1,What a waste!,"I too, would give it zero stars if I could. I can't stand this toy. Not only is it loud, the balls ALWAYS shoot away from it. They never go down the spiral. Then my dog chases the balls and chews on them. And my son (1 year-old) just looks at it like it's the dumbest toy ever. I agree. I wish I read the reviews before I bothered buying it."
2,Terrified,"My son is 11 months old and is absolutely terrified of this toy. I had been looking for something new and there were limited toys for his age group. The fan is very loud as well as the music. He might be able to grow into it but I don't see it being much fun as he gets older. It sounds like alot of children love it, just be warned it may be a little too much for a younger child."
2,Never works the way it is supposed to,"I cannot stand this toy. The music is way too loud and there is no way to turn it down. If the pieces are not aligned perfectly, the balls bounce all over the place and then I have to go get them. My one year old likes it okay, but he can't push the button hard enough to start it himself. His favorite thing is when I get hit in the head with a ball. He has also begun trying to put other items in it. I guess that's educational, like yes the lego fits in the hole but no, the shoe does not. Playing with this toy takes so much effort from a parent that you may as well save your money and just dance around the living room for your baby. I have put this toy at the back of the closet and I will bring it out again when he is four or five. My sister-in-law gave it to us as a gift, and I think it was to get us back for when we bought her 3 year old a toy drum and cymbals set."
2,Waste of my money,"I don't know what made me want to get this for my 9 month old son. It doesn't seem to work on our floor, so there isn't much ball popping going on and when it does work it only holds his attention for a minute or so. Once we had it assembled, he looked at it for a bit and started playing with the box it came in instead. The only good thing that came from buying this were the balls, which I probably could have just bought separately and saved my self at least 15 bucks!"
2,Fun but silly toy,I got this toy for my 1 year old-and of course it entertains my 3 & 5 yr old-but they get bored of it-after a few min. -and we just got it-I'd like to see how long it takes for them to stop using it totally. It's definitely fun and exciting at first-but the point that it can't be operated without a battery-is definitly a drawback. should've gone with the manual ones instead. Also like prev. posts say-the balls sometimes don't pop out-so my baby just turns the whole machine over in order to get the balls out-for that I can use a bucket with some balls instead.
2,Sounds like a hand vac,I think my kids would really like this except my 2.5 year old son doesn't like how it sounds. I haven't really had a chance to show it to my 9 month old b/c he freaks out when I suggest we play with it. I will try again b/c I think they will like it. They love the [...]
4,Crazy toy!,This toy is great for my 13 month old! My son loves to try to catch the balls as the pop out of the top. He also tries to push the balls down while the others are trying to pop out. One downside to this toy is that the balls will pop out of the tube and bounce out of the top and onto the floor. If my son already is holding a ball in each hand he wont go after the others on the floor so eventually there is no balls in the toy and I have to put them back in it. But really this is a good toy to play alongside with your child. It is fun to watch him frantically try to stop the balls from going back down the slide and into the tunnel. A hint if you do buy it and the balls pop out all over the place: us batteries that are halfway dead! The first batteries I put in this toy were dying and I did not have a problem with the balls going onto the floor because the air was not so forceful. We have put this toy in a corner so usually the balls bounce on the wall and back onto the top of the toy.
3,Not worth it...,"I like the concept of this toy...but I actually kind of hate it in person. We got this for my daughter's first birthday after reading all of the great reviews, but 6 months later, it hasn't gotten much use from her. My daughter just doesn't seem that interested (and I certainly don't) in chasing 5 little balls all over the room. The balls NEVER stay on the track. The track itself is pretty flimsy and every time she turns the thing on I have to manipulate it somehow to get the balls to run down the track properly. It's such a pain. The music IS extremely loud as well. There's just more things about this toy that are annoying than they are fun. Maybe as she gets older and enjoys chasing the balls all over she'll get more use out of it."
4,What a wonderful toy!!!,"I bought this for my nephew for his first birthday. Not only did he play with this for at least an hour, his almost three year old sister also played with it. I read a comment that a mom complained about chasing down the balls. Well let me tell you, my niece & nephew loved chasing the balls, we didn't have to. I highly recommend this toy."
2,Falls apart,"I bought this toy for my 8 month old thinking she would get a kick out of the balls popping out while the music played. When I sit her down beside it, she wants a closer look and pulls the yellow top over so she can look inside. When she does this, the yellow and orange funnels come apart from the bottom part that houses the fan. So, I put it back together and she does the same thing. Also, my 3 year old wanted to get in on the action and ended up getting his hand stuck inside the bottom portion just as some of the other reviewers have noted. If the toy would stay put together, it would be much more enjoyable. As I write this review, the toy is in three pieces in the toy box and the balls are MIA."
5,Still fun at 19 Months,"My son got this as a present from his Grandpa at about 4 months. He loved it then, and he still loves it now. I had to order more of the little balls from playskool, because my cats think they're awesome, too! It was only about [...] for a new set. The balls from this product also fit into a variety of other playskool toys, which I really like. My son likes the music, he loves to have the air blow in his face, and it always makes him giggle, even now at 19 months. I'd recommend for the value and fun factor alone!OVERALL:A great, durable toy that lasts!"
3,High maintenance toy for parents but fun for kids,"We received the ball popper as a gift for my 6 month old. She likes the loud music it plays and has a good time watching the balls pop out. However, my impression from the box was that the balls would pop out the top and roll down the ramp back into the machine to pop out again. In actual use, the balls rarely go down the ramp but rather 80% of them pop out onto the floor and all over the place. Then mom & dad have to go fetch them all. Overall, I am glad she has fun with it, but the clean up is high maintenance for the parents. So just be aware of that before you get this toy. Also, my husband decided to look down the tube while it was running and got popped in the eye by a ball. I feel like by 9 months old your average child would know better but just beware for the younger kids (and the occasional husband)."
1,Spend more time chasing balls then he get's to play,"I'm very dissappointed with this product, I purchased for my 10 month old for christmas. 90% of the time the balls shoot out and I'm hunting under furniture for them he ends up losing intrest as soon as they shoot out, he's only entertained while they cycle through which doesn't last long..He has no interest in hunting for the balls...So if you enjoy hunting down the balls this toy is for you !!!"
3,Meh...,"My inlaws bought this for my kids. The kids love it, but it has some cons. First, it's really loud and annoying. Second, if you lose any of the balls it's not as fun. It's harder for the fan to push the balls out if there are only a few in there. The balls themselves aren't very sturdy and can easily be smashed. The toy itself is small, and also not very sturdy. The base is smaller than the top and it tips over really easily. BUT the kids still love it."
4,Fun for kids and cats,Bought this for my youngest daughter. She loves it and so did the seven other kids that invaded the house over christmas break. They range from age 2-10. They made a game of picking one ball to keep track of then chasing after it as all the balls came exploding out. Then the cat jumped in on the fun and they kept playing for an hour just to watch the cat go nuts chasing after the balls!! It was fun to watch.
1,Our dog loves it ...,"Like others mentioned, balls rarely go back to the toy. So I always have to run to catch the balls before our dog does! My 9 months old son likes ""Busy Ball-Tivity Center"" better too. If balls are not missing (because our dog destroyed some already), I would definitely return it."
2,a fun toy when it works,"This is the third ball popper we acquired, each with the hope that the toy would work as promised by the toymaker. When it works properly the grandkids love it and want to play with it constantly. But for some reason the motor gives out quickly (we try new batteries) and as a result the ball popper can barely pop the balls. A big disappointment, again!"
4,HUGE fun and really LOUD,"This toy has been such an enormous hit at our house, it's hard to complain about it: we have children ranging from age 1 to age 7, and they ALL play with it, with great delight. BUT, it's so LOUD! It's like running a hair dryer or air popcorn popper, plus the frantic music and silly noises. It drives me nuts after about thirty seconds. But they LOVE it. I guess I'd call this a ""play with it in your room with the door closed while Mommy puts a wet washcloth on her forehead"" toy: worth every single penny, but a parental love sacrifice to allow it in the house."
5,Loved by all ages!,"I wasn't sure about this toy, but then I went to a playgroup where there was one... EVERY child there, from 5 months to 5 years, was playing with it and having a blast! I decided to get one on the spot. My baby loves it! The balls are a bit of a pain to chase, but it's worth it for the entertainment value. Very few toys hold my demanding girl's interest for long, but this one is a winner."
5,A Hit Since Day One!,"My son received this a few months ago as a gift for his first birthday. The one we have is different colors than the one shown, but from the moment this was removed from its box, it has been a favorite for him. He quickly learned how to push the button to turn it on and enjoys chasing the balls all around his playroom. He also enjoys just putting his face over the top to feel the air come out. :) My only complaint is that when he puts something in the ball shoot that is not supposed to go in there, it is a little difficult to pull it apart for when I have to dig it out. I suppose it makes it good that they can't easily rip it apart, but makes it difficult for mom when you're trying to fix it and you have an angry 16-month old that just wants to play with it... Overall, I would highly recommend this toy!"
4,noisy but lots of fun,"my 11 month old loves it, and so does her cat. keeps them busy, only problem, sometimes the balls fly to high and roll across the room, and then kitty takes them further, other wise it is great, it is a bit loud but not to bad. not a good toy for a baby to stand with, does get knocked over easy. helps with hand-eye coordination. plays lots of great songs"
5,Great occupant,"This toy is great, and even the bigger kids enjoy it. My son got it for christmas when he was 7 months old and even though he couldn't operate it then, it didnt take long for him to learn how it worked. He is now 9 months and laughs at it. The only bad thing, is when all of the balls are in it, they fly all over the place instead of staying on course, so i have to chase the balls around and put them back in it. Other than that, its a great toy!"
5,Fun for Everyone,"To be honest I almost returned this toy that was a Christams gift because we have plenty of 'ball' toys, but after begging for my 5 year old I gave it to 1 year old and the fun began! This toy is great fun, all of my children love to play with it (1, 4 and 5) but my 1 year old screams with delight. There is a little puff of air that comes out the top and she learned quickly if she puts her hand over the top and takes it away all the balls gently pop up. The only thing that she has not figured out is how to push the red button down to start the toy back up - but her brother and sister help her with that. This is a fun, fun toy and has been a family favorite - the best of all the ""ball"" toys out there!"
2,Too loud,"I wish I would have read more reviews on this... I bought it for my one year old's birthday. WAY too loud, obnoxious is more like it. Both of my kids like the activity but walk away before they're done being entertained because it's too loud. Plus it takes 4 D batteries, $$$. Getting rid of it and sticking to my wooden toy purchases."
2,What a let down,"This toy was a major let down. We received it as a shower gift and eagerly awaited the time our son could play with it. The balls barely pop out of the tube and usually only if we push them through. By the time we get them moving enough on their own, the fan stops and the balls collect inside again. It's a major frustration for me let alone our son."
2,good concept but...,looks fun and entertaining but it is so loud. It is louder than a hair dryer and almost like a vacuum cleaner. The balls flies everywhere randomly instead of going down the designated path. The parents will be chasing after the balls instead of the babies or toddlers.
4,Balls everywhere!,"I bought this toy for my one-year old daughter and she really likes playing with it. I'm not sure if there's a design flaw or not, but a lot of the balls pop up in the air and out of the toy, which leaves me chasing them around everywhere trying to put them back in. Other than that annoyance, it's a really cute little toy at a good price."
2,Air too forceful,"An interesting concept, but the balls get blown off of the toy by the force of the air coming out of the tube and my soon to be one year old grandson isn't at the stage where he is willing or able to run after the balls and place them back in the unit. It would have made for a much better toy if the balls did not fly off. This toy is a toy that requires constant adult supervision in order to keep the child entertained."
2,Noisy and Unpleasant,"I am very disappointed in this toy. The motor is so very loud, and it sounds just like a hair dryer. The motor noise even drowns out the songs and sound effects. I ordered this toy new from Amazon in July 2007. If I had it to do over again, I would NOT purchase this toy."
2,Boring ball flopper,I could not have been more discouraged with this toy and would return it if I could. The blowing air was the only thing my 12 months old baby liked. The ball get stuck at the botton and won't always pop up which discouraged my daugher. She would stick her arm down the hole and then fall over. I was afraid she was going to break or injure her arm so I put the toy up until she was older. She is now 21 months old and still has no interest in the toy. She has taken the top shoots off of it and only plays with the balls. Hopefully I will get a good price for it at the garage sale this summer.
1,danger,"recall this toy, it is dangerous! recall,recall,recall,recall. before some innocent child really gets a serious injury. you as the store should stop selling this awful toy!"
4,Great Fun!,"I bought this toy for my son's 1st birthday. He squeals with delight whenever we turn it on. He loves playing with the balls and watching the action. One thing you should know is that usually a ball or two will ""pop"" out of the top and land on the floor. Otherwise a great toy that entertains and helps to develope motor skills."
4,"My son likes, but is a little wary of it!","My son really likes putting the balls in and watching them go down the ramp into the tunnel, but he is a little wary/scared of the loud noise (kind of vaccum-like) when you actually turn it on. It is a pretty neat toy though, and I think he will grow out of being scared of it (he is usually fine when I sit by him and reassure him...he is 11 months old)."
4,Fun toy for 8-12 months,"This product is great fun for a young baby (8-12 months) and our baby's older siblings (8 and 10 yrs) had a great time playing with their little brother with it. It is fun to watch, but chasing the balls around the room after they pop out is a chore for everyone (but part of the fun). Sort of like the I Love Lucy episode with the conveyor belt that goes too fast to keep up with. Overall, fun for everyone. ONE IMPORTANT NOTE: The Amazon listing incorrectly states that batteries are included. Mine did not come with batteries and the box specifically says ""not included"". Not a cost issue, but definitely disappointing if you cannot get started right when you open it."
2,Fan does not blow out balls,"My friend's child had this toy, and my daughter wanted one. Maybe mine is defective, but it never worked properly. The fan is not strong enough to blow the balls out the way they should (even with new, high-quality batteries). I have to place my hand over the top to create some suction, then release to get the balls to blow out for a couple of seconds, then I repeat. My daughter loves the balls, but gets so frustrated with it. She and her her playdates much prefer to stick things that don't belong down there (little people, dinosaurs, balls that don't fit, and arms which get stuck!) Then I have to take it apart to get those out. I don't recommend this toy at all."
2,Plays itself,"My 11 month old got so frustrated by this toy she almost started crying. She wanted to play with the balls, but as soon as they popped up, they rolled down the slide and out of reach. It seemed like the toy was playing by itself and there was nothing for her to do. I took it back."
1,BEWARE PARENTS!!!!!!,I thought getting this item for my daughter's first Birthday was going to be exciting.. In fact it's was the total opposite. It was a nightmare. My daughter got her arm stuck inside of the hole where the balls come out. Not only could we not get her arm out the suction on the toy made it impossible to get her arm to move. My poor daughter First Birthday was ruined by that toy. I do warn you parents BEWARE of this toy. I emailed and contacted the manufacture of this toy and was given a brush off. I think this item should be taken off the shelves. Very dangerous!!
5,"Great fun for babies, toddlers and adults too!",I bought this for my daughter when she was 9 months old and she loved it. She is now 19 months old and still enjoys playing with it as do her three year old cousins.I don't think it has much educational value but it is fun to watch the balls running around and popping out and mobile children will enjoy chasing them.It also seems very safe. My daughter has often put her hand into the machine and has never been hurt or gotten stuck. The motor and any moving parts other than the balls are safely encased in the interior of the toy where kids can't reach them. The only drawback is having to retrieve balls from under the sofa from time to time.It is a noisy toy.
4,Has its ups and downs,We bought this for our 8 month old and he likes to watch it. But he would really rather pull it over and chew on it. It doesn't really encourage independant play since the only thing for the child to do is push the button and then sit back and watch. One downfall for it (although my son likes this part) is that the balls are constantly flying out and all over the room. You'll find you spend most of the time picking up the balls. But my husband and I are also entertained by this toy (sometimes I think my husband likes it more than my son!)
3,"Fun toy, but a tad bit Dangerous","My 15 month old daughter has had her arm stuck, (and I mean stuck), twice now from trying to dig the balls out by hand. I had to take it away for this reason.It is a good toy, but make sure you pay close attention to where your childs hands are at all times while playing with it."
3,"Fun, but disappointed with quality","Both of my children (18 months and 4 years) really love this toy - it's noisy and they have a lot of fun chasing the balls. My husband and I even have fun playing, too - though I am quite disappointed in the quality. The yellow top bowl *always* falls off; it doesn't attach securely at all. Also, it works fine on fresh batteries (the balls pop everywhere!) but after just a few plays, the motor loses a lot of power and the balls back up in the toy, requiring you to push them through so they pop out the top. They still seem to have fun with it, so I guess it was worth the money anyway. Would I buy it, knowing what I know now? Honestly, I don't know..."
3,Just stops working - We're on our 2nd one!,"I have bought two of these for my grandson. I gave him the first one about a year ago and all of a sudden, it just stopped working - we replaced the batteries, etc. with no luck. He loved it so much, I bought him a 2nd one. Same scenario - just stopped working. It's really a shame because he really enjoyed this toy. Everytime I see him, he asks me if I bought him a new popper but I just can't see wasting my money."
3,"Favorite toy, with some intricacies","This is my 9-month old son's favorite toy. He gets spellbound by it and will watch it for an hour if we let him. That being said, it has it's problems. It does fall apart easily. I'm constantly pushing the pieces back together. The balls do get stuck. If too many line up going into the bottom, you do have to give them a push sometimes. And you do sometimes have to play pickup. The balls pop out and you end up chasing them. If you don't care to do that, use older batteries. We were surprised that they stopped popping out, only to find that the batteries were getting low. Have them too low, though, and the balls won't come out at all. That all being said, it's my son's absolute favorite toy!"
2,"So far, no go","So far, I don't get the positive reviews. The toy sounds like a hair dryer with calliope music superimposed. It's pretty irritating to me; I can't imagine that a 9-mo-old would like the noise. It happens that my 25-month-old has never liked the sound or the blowing of hairdryers--that's the one part of his first haircut that made him cry--and he won't play with the toy as designed. He loves the light plastic balls and has created several games for them, and he has had fun dismantling the body of the toy, but he won't let me turn on the switch. I don't think of him as overly timid. He is very fun-loving and loves his music toys, but so far this toy hasn't worked for him. Maybe he'll get used to it. My husband, on the other hand, thinks the toy is a riot."
3,Very Loud,"This toy has a very loud motor. While the ball popping seems pretty entertaining, everytime I turn it on it really scares my 9 month old because it is so loud."
2,Watch Young Kids Under Four With This Toy,"I see alot of good reviews on this product so maybe this just happened to my son. The toy is very fun for him to watch, and grab balls however my son has a knack for testing things it seems. I was in the kitchen while he had this toy, and I noticed when I came out he had stuck his whole arm down the tunnel trying to grab a ball, and got it stuck. He is almost two, and boys are more likely to be rough with the toys. Anyway long story short I had to use baby oil to get his arm out. I will be contacting the company before I throw the toy out. Other than that the blue slide was constantly being taken off by my son. I rated five stars for fun because he had more attention on this than anything else for awhile."
4,"fun toy, but balls are not durable","I bought this toy for my triplet girls, when they were 9 months old. They really enjoyed it, and they soon learned how to start the machine on their own. They did need help collecting the balls and placing them back in the machine. One major flaw is the quality of the balls. My girls literally chewed them up. One ball ended up getting squooshed so much that it cracked, and once that happens it can't get lifted through the air tube. We're now down to 3 (out of 5) balls, and they are all in bad shape -- the surfaces are all chewed up and rough, and they do not go through the tube very smoothly. It renders the toy basically useless. When I sent $ to Hasbro for replacement balls, they were not in stock, and they could not tell me when they would be in stock. So now the toy has lost a lot of its appeal."
4,13 month old loves it!,"My baby girl (13 monthsO loves this. She loves to push the balls back down the blower sleeve and they just pop up and hover which she likes. I wish they would have made the sides to the ball slide on top a little longer because when the thing gets going, the balls bounce off the edge and go everywhere! I suppose that is part of the fun, chasing the balls around the room as they roll away.Not a Battery Pig at all!I recommend for 9months to 2 years"
3,Great fun (while it lasts),"This ball popper is a great toy and would be a 5 star product if they could figure out how to make the batteries last longer. My 15 month old has loved playing with this toy for months, but I have had to replace the batteris twice now. The popper works like a hair dryer in a tube, pulling in hollow ""ping pong"" type balls using suction through one end and blowing it out the other. When the batteries are low (about 3 days after installing), the suction does not work as well and you have to give the balls a little push to get them started. Not easy to figure out when you're 15 months old, so the toy can be frustrating until Mommy or Daddy get it going. Installing batteries at the rate required to keep this ""popping"" is bad for the environment and the wallet."
2,What a pain!,We received this toy as a gift and we should have returned it. This toy basically spits out the balls like popcorn which rarely fall into the track...you will spend so much time chasing them and putting them back in....what a pain! I don't care for toys that create a TON of work for minimal entertainment value.
4,Fun but LOUD,We got this as a birthday gift for our 1 year old. She can turn it on by herself and loves to play with it and dance to the music.The one downside is the volume. It is LOUD...by far the loudest toy that our 1 year old has. I wish it had a setting to lower the volume (or if it just was lower all the time).
2,Great idea - but it doesn't work very well...,"We purchased this for my 10 month old. The idea is wonderful, but the balls don't land in the tray after they pop out - they fly and bounce out and roll across the floor instead. This toy will not function unless you are there to pick each ball up as it flies out and drop it back into the tray. My son still loves it, and although he can push the button, he cannot play with it by himself because all of the balls are out of the toy within about 10 seconds."
2,Bad Design,Not the best toy...the balls pop up and fly out of the toy and are lost under furniture. My child is able to stick his entire arm down the tube where the balls come from and get it stuck or stick other things down the tube which lodge in there and stop the toy from working.
2,BALLS GET STUCK ALL THE TIME,"When this toy works properly, my 14 month old son loves it! But it seems the balls get stuck in the tube all the time and never come out or just flout near the exit hole....frustrating my son and me! I don't know if the motor isn't powerful enough or we have a defective toy...but we hardly use anymore because it never works well for more than a minute or so...and when the balls do actually ""pop"" out they go flying all over the place....not impressed with this toy at all."
3,Balls everywhere!,"This toy is LOUD but fun to look at - when it actually runs right. As said before in another review, the balls pop everywhere all over the room. My 9 month old has more fun crawling around with a ball in each hand than actually putting the balls back in the shoot. In fact, he likes playong with the balls independently so much, I ordered a second set because they end up underneath the couch, his crib, etc. My mom even found 2 at her house! I've decided to put the ball machine away for a few more months until he gets a little older."
1,"Fun, but not durable",I bought this for my son and he loved trying to catch the balls coming out. Too bad the toy did not last and the balls stopped popping out. We returned it and got a new one and the same thing happened. The motor does not seem to work well and I would not recommend it as neither toy lasted more than two weeks.
5,Durable and Lovable,"My son is 18 months and his cousin is a year and they both love this toy. At times they would even stick other things in the tube but it never breaks! The balls pop out at different heights and times so they can't ever figure out what exactly will happen next, it just keeps them squeeling for more."
5,Great toy,I got this for our 9 month old son and he absolutely loves it. He loves to watch the balls go thru it and to wait for them to pop up. He pushes the button over and over again to make it go and then sits there with his hand next to the shoot waiting for a ball to grab. Then he drops it in the hole and grabs another one. I would definitely recommend this toy. My only complaint is that it tips over easy but overall it is a great toy.
3,HIDDEN DANGER!,My son received this for his first birthday...it was a hit! A few days later his hand got caught in the tubing when he reached in for the ball. Took about 5 minutes to get his hand out (holding his hand WITH THE TOY ON IT over his head and disassembling the toy.) Contacted Hasbro and they happily offered a refund upon us sending the toy back to them. Fastforward 8 months...grandma just bought this for the same child for Christmas (we never told her of the incident). We thought we were safe because his hand has grown...4 year old son got his hand caught!
5,Ball Popper,"The 1-year old loves it, and so do the older kids. If you put your hand over the place where the balls come out, for just a few seconds, it 'builds pressure' and when released the balls pop out higher. The 'older kids' game is to catch the balls before they hit the ground. Can be somewhat lively -- especially when the 1 year old wants to play with his own toy again!"
4,Awsome Toy!,"My 2,3, and 5- year-old boys love this toy. we first saw it at a friends home and they couldn't get enough of it. however the yellow top comes off often. so we just stopped putting it on. the balls still shoot up and my kids still have tons of fun with it, so if you are tired of putting the top on over and over again, stop. they will still play with it and have tons of fun even without the yellow top piece."
4,"Will be used for a long, long time...","My sister had this for her older daughter, so I had to get one for our little girl. At first we weren't sure if she liked it or not, but then she started whining if we didn't push the plunger again fast enough (she doesn't quite have the leverage yet to push it herself). She loves to watch the balls, experiments with what happens when she blocks it in certain places, pulls balls out....This is a very durable toy, so it is easy to find used, but it's worth it to buy new. My niece played with it from 6 months through 3 years!The whole thing is pretty sturdy. The only negative is, as a previous reviewer said, you spend a good amount of time retrieving balls, if your child isn't able to go get them herself. But the fact that the balls sometimes go popping up and out unexpectedly is one of the most attractive things about this toy for the kids, and eventually she'll go get them herself."
4,good stirdy replacement,"I had plastic valtera connectors on my RV and the city water connection snapped with just a little tug on the hose. This is brass and bullet proof, and the holes lined up exactly with the original equipment."
5,Perfect match for my MH - hose connection a little flimsy,"This item was an exact match for replacing both the city fill and black water flush ports on our 1999 Newmar Dutch Star MH. It is stamped with a ""B&B"" logo which I had tried unsuccessfully to find before deciding that this one looked close enough. Very happy to discover it's the same make and model. The brass connection is nice and solid on the plumbing side but the metal on the hose side seems a little thin. I plan to use it with a 90 degree elbow to reduce any stress."
3,does the job,"for those in need of a replacement city water inlet, this does the job just fine. the white plastic blends in better on the RV siding compared to the mill finish metal one that was there before."
3,"Buy A Used Copy of Gregg Simplified, Not This Version","This review is not a critique of Gregg shorthand ""Simplified Version,"" of which I am a huge fan and has proved invaluable for someone who attends frequent meetings. Instead, I am critical of the text being sold, because, unlike used copies, it does not contain an answer key to the exercises, which is extremely important. I learned this after I bought the new text, misplaced it, and ordered a used text for under $6.00, including S&H. Consequently, while I highly recommend Gregg Shorthand Simplified Version (there are a number of different versions and this is the most useful), I would only buy a used text."
4,Just what I wanted,The book arrived in good condition as promised. Yea..just what I wanted. The book gets a five. The delivery gets a yuck because I wanted it sooner. Over all a great deal. Sorry for the missing star in the rating.
2,this was pretty disappointing,"i've found this book good for learning what the shorthand symbols are, but when it comes to practicing writing them, it was seriously lacking. i used gregg-ruled notebooks to practice writing, but in the book, the symbols are shown without lines so it's impossible to learn placement of symbols. how do you know if symbols are supposed to extend above or below a line? you don't. learning to write english as a child, you were taught how to properly place letters on lines...it helps give perspective. otherwise an ""h"" could look like an ""n"" and vice versa. this book is very frustrating and i'm going to look into finding another that is more appropriate."
3,I did not need to buy this book.,"So far, I haven't used this book once in my online studies. Not sure if it will be useful or not farther along into the course."
3,Ok,The handbook does not include a full translation for each shorthand word. If one is not familiar with this edition of shorthand you would not be able to fully translate the sentences which are written in shorthand.
4,Gregg Shorthand Manual,This book is awesome.brings me back to my high school years..what a great learning tool...The delievery time was outstanding..i would recommend it to everyone..
5,Shorthand,This book was easy to read and the instuction was easy to follow..It is not a complicated book..It was a used book but it looked new and very clean..I received this book in a timely manner.
1,Hard to learn and use,"It was difficult to learn these ""scribbles"" which don't mean anything. I""ll have to spend weeks and months to remember them. I could not keep them in my memory all the time to use them when I needed to."
1,Old stuff!,"The book is copyrighted 1955; it talks of using the shorthand system with a steno pad. In the Gregg system, certain symbols are identified by how much of a line they occupy in the stenopad, i.e.: half-line; whole-line, etc. Hardly useful for one about to begin studying to be a court reporter that uses a stenotype machine. There are no lines to use. The book was a huge dissapointment."
5,Quick notes,Every take shorthand? I didn't but I always wondered how it worked and if I couldlearn how to do it. Curious? Give it a try.
5,Thank you for this book!,It was a treat to find this book--I was amazed at how quickly my old skills resurfaced. The book is well organized and very easy to use!
1,Strategy for Who?,"The description of the book says that ""Active Management"" is the set of new and powerful methods for investors to survive any climate.Well, I'd say its a powerful method for investment advisors to manage investor funds. If you are looking for methods or systems for investing, this book is a bust. What it is really about is driving home the distinction between money managers and asset gatherers, and how they can work together.Huh? And why do I as an individual investor want to read about this? Maybe so I understand the pitch from a fund of funds manager. But really, from the the title and the description, I expected something very different. If you are expecting what I was, don't buy this. (And why does Amazon ratings require at least one star... a zero feels appropriate)."
4,Unflinching Historical Overview,"Author has written an unflinching historical review of Islam from its origins to recent times. Dr. Schmidt tells it like it is - without waffling to accomodate politically correct bias. The book is written from a Christian perspective so, while accurate and honest, it isn't ambivalent. It's a good reference to have on your bookshelf."
3,Getting to love even more Blessed Mother Mary!!,"Well, this book brought me even closer to the holly events of the New Testament!! Being a mother myself, I felt even closer to lovely Maria, with a deep human compassion and a deep religious and human respect...The details of the everyday living and human contact of those days is an invaluable historical find!!The book being based on parts of another big book (The Passion of Christ) reffering only to Mother Mary'life, looses its deeper impact and value as a quality Literature book...I also felt , that I needed to learn more about the common life of Joseph, Mary, and all of their children! But this part of Maria's life is unfortunately missing in this book , while it is not missing in the Bible Itself ( : The original New Testament in Ancient Greek) ..."
5,Vision of the life of Mary as mother of Christ and Church.,"Miss Emmerich relates in minute and often beautiful detail her visions of the life of Mary, from her conception to her assumption. Although not necessarily historical, the visions are a benefit to meditation on the events that we do know to have taken place, and help transport the reader back to Palestine in the first century."
5,A must,"I find it hard to put this book down. A must read got Catholics and people of other faiths. It fits all the pieces of the mystery surrounding Mary together. It just all makes perfect sense. She was not picked randomly, but promised through her ancestors. It's one of those books you want to go on forever."
4,a very informative and charming book,"As many of the readers of this review will likely know, this book was one of the sources of private revelation used as information to create background and characterization in the Passion of the Christ. It is a wonderful book, and contains many insights into the life of the Blessed Virgin and the Holy Family.However, I must say that when I compare and contrast this book with Mary of Agreda's Mystical City of God, it is less cohesive, theologically oriented, systematic, and supernaturally focused (relatively speaking). Both books are good and are of course excellent additions to a Catholic library and a source of spiritual edification, and it is filled with genuine private revelation, but stylistically and in terms of depth, breadth, and cohesion Mystical City of God by Mary of Agreda is superior."
3,Information Not Authentic,"The book is written in detailed day to day happenings with the Virgin Mary and her family. The book isn't written with the kind of information I'm used to reading on other visionaries. I decided to research information on Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich and found that the book has not been approved by the Catholic Church as accurate and authentic. She was, infact, a very holy woman and did receive visions; however, the information states that, ""The authenticity of Brentano's writings has been questioned and critics have characterized the books as ""conscious elaborations by a poet"" and a ""well-intentioned fraud"" by Brentano"". Apparently Brentano spoke a different dialect and could not transcribe Blessed Anne's information immediately and had to wait until he went home. Brentano did not complete his editing for publication until 10 years after Blessed Anne's death. If you'd like to review more information, you can go to http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=6001."
4,The Life of the Blessed Virgin Mary,"This book should get more attention even in the Catholic community. Those folks with little understanding of the importance of the Blessed Virgin and cannot except what Catholics believe, might just change their minds."
5,absolutely wonderful book,"this book a wonderfully written book. very detailed, you almost feel as if you are there.it is great."
4,Glory days long past,"The glory days are long gone for ECW, but this was a nice visit with a few of ""the Originals""."
2,Not worth it,I was very disappointed with this DVD. If you have done any yoga before you already know what is in this DVD. Working with the breath is the foundation in yoga. The rider in this DVD is floppy and not properly seated so therefore not moving with the horse. I would not recommend it.
3,the opening does not fit the single DIN audio system size,"the opening does not fit the single DIN audio system size, i dont want to use dremel tool or a file to make to opening fit."
2,Does the job,"This bracket does the job, but does not match the trim on my car. The curvature is also incorrect -- in other words, its looks aftermarket."
3,Stick ons won't stick,"The game is fun, grandkids enjoy it, but it is so frustrating that the pieces that are supposed to ""stick like magic"" won't even stick at all. Is it just mine in particular? They wouldn't stick from the very first try. Otherwise...cute game, lots of laughs, especially from our 3 year old."
3,Not played with often but fun,"My daughter is 4 now. She's had this game for a little over a year. She rarely asks to play it but when we do, it's usually fun."
2,frustrating,"Didn't colorforms stick when we were younger? When you hold the toy upright in the holders they give you, the colorforms slide off. They work like the first three times you use the game. The idea is good but the quality is very disappointing and the child gets bored because the product does not work properly"
2,pieces do not stick at all,"This is a cute game. My 3 year old had fun with it for about 5 minutes. The pieces would not stick to the faces. They only stuck after she licked them. I know, it's gross, sorry. She is a resourceful 3 year old;) cute idea, but bad execution."
1,Very Disappointed....,"I purchased this game as a Christmas gift for my 2 and 4 year olds. I was very disappointed when I opened the package. The adhesive pieces were curling off of the sheets. When I removed them and tried to stick them on the faces, they wouldn't stick! We didn't even get one use out of this game and it is basically going to be in the trash, unless there is any way the manufacturer will send us new adhesive sheets. Sad to say it, but this game is not worth the money."
1,Not worth it.,"We purchased this to replace a version purchased in 1997. My wife used this game with many children in her sppech therapy job. Unfortunately, this game lost its adhesive qualities after 2 uses. the quality of the game is much worse than it used to be. this is not an Amazon issue, but rather the a manufacturing problem. i would not recomment this board game to anyone who wants to get a long life out of it."
5,Great preschool fun!,This was the perfect first game for my mature toddler. I loved to watch him surprise himself as he mixed and matched the components of a face into outrageous combinations!
5,Silly Face Game- Fun for preschool kids,This is the second Silly Face game I have purchased. My grandchildren love playing it. It's the first thing they go for when they come to our house. I wish it was still available in stores
1,Not Pleased,I am a teacher of preschool age children. This game was not durable. The pieces that should be reusable for the faces only stuck one time and curled up after that. I absolutely do not recommend this game.
3,Fun concept but poor quality,"We got this to play with my 3 year old son. The concept is very fun. You spin a spinner and it lands on a part of the face; then you get to pick out a nose, mouth, eyes, etc. and stick it on your card. The first person to complete a face wins!The face pieces are fun and goofy and highly amusing to all of us and it is a fun game.The problem is with the durability. After playing it once or twice none of the colorform pieces will stick to the faces anymore. They all curl up and fall off. This is frustrating to me and incredibly frustrating to my three year old. We can clean them off and flatten them and then they work for a little bit again.The spinner is also poor quality, it gets stuck a lot and is in general hard to spin. I guess not a bit deal, but it is just one more thing to hassle with.Personally I would recommendCootieover this game if you want a type of building game."
5,Years of fun,"This has been a favorite for all three of my children, as well as their friends. While I would mostly recommend it for children around three years old, my five year old and even seven year old still play along. (They think it's funny to put the smiles upside down and do goofy things with the hair.) It's quick and easy for the three year old set to understand. They can play the whole game without an adult stepping in to correct them or tell them where a pawn needs to go. Plus, it's not a huge deal when someone wins because then the other players can just finish their faces and show them off. A classic game that you can play every day and is still fun."
2,Colorforms,"This product arrived dried out and used-looking. The colorforms didn't stick, and the individual pieces rolled up. Terrible."
4,A nice change.,"For a parent who remembers Colorforms from her own childhood, I enjoy watching my four year old experiment with the silly faces in this game. The game itself is fun and he can ""play"" it by himself just by making up the silliest faces he can. The big problem I've had with the game is the small cards they supply to store the colorforms on. There are specific places to put each of the pieces and my child doesn't have the coordination to put them away himself. The game comes with a warning to store the colorforms carefully or they may stick to each other and lose their coloring. A simple large card would have worked much better."
1,colorforms don't stick at all!!!,"This was bought for my twin daughters age 3 for Christmas. We opened the box and started to play. What a cute game, my daughters would have really loved the game if they weren't getting so frustrated about the face parts not sticking to the cards. We used to have colorforms as kids and we loved them. I couldn't believe that the Colorform brand would be such bad quality. They did not stick at all right out of the box!!! The game is useless. The parts don't even lay flat on the card to get away without the sticky. Horrible horrible...don't waste your money."
4,Great for new game players,My daughter has played this game at her speech therapy sessions. It is a perfect game for 3 to 4 year olds who are learning to take turns. She enjoys it so much I ordered one for at home. Kids can be creative with the faces and it's a short game for short attention spans.
4,It is kinda fun but it is just a chance game. Playing it with young kids it okay.,"It has sticky stickers that you can desighn a face with. When your done you can pull of the stickers. You spinn the spinner if you get a 6 you can put on a hat or hair,3 nose ext. We made up this rule: If your the winner you can diseced who's face you like better,not counting your own.Game information:Ages:3-8Players:2-4(you can just desghin faces by your self but that isn't really playing the game)Time:5 minutesI think this game is a bit young for me. But it is fun when your looking for a nice simple fun game.Lydiaage 10"
5,Excellent album,"This album has some excellent tracks on it, like ""It's no game part one"", ""Ashes to Ashes"", ""Scary Monsters (and super creeps)"", and ""Scream like a baby"". Some of the subject matter may be a bit off putting especially if you're in a bad mood. ""It's no game"" has a reference to suicide (about putting a bullet in his brain). But Bowie and pals do an excellent job here. Bowie's singing is good, and the guitar playing is good too. For some reason though I really enjoy Dennis Davis's drumming on ""Ashes to Ashes"".I'm pretty sure he mostly worked with Bowie (I think this might have been his last album drumming for Bowie though). Dennis came from a fusion background and started playing with Bowie on Station to Station."
4,Rock with a vengeance,"Scary Monsters saw Bowie's return to a full-bodied rock sound, heavy with guitar and feedback. The catchy Ashes To Ashes revisits Major Tom of Space Oddity while the funky Fashion with its gripping vocals is in a way a rock treatment of a theme from Young Americans - it has become a club classic. Other great tracks include Up The Hill Backwards, Scream Like A Baby and the cover of Tom Verlaine's Kingdom Come. The sound is as heavy as on The Man Who Sold The World but with all the added experiments of the 1970's to create a very 80's hard rock effect. It is definitely more accessible to the rock fan than any of his Eno albums that went before, and better than most of what followed."
5,"A real-life adventure, worth more than pieces of gold!","This is David Bowie's finest album, bar none. The lyrics, singing and musicianship displayed here are all top notch. Bowie was at the top of his game, and unfortunately has not come close since. ""Teenage Wildlife"" is simultaneously soaring and deeply personal, probably the best single song Bowie ever recorded. ""It's No Game"" (both parts) are eviscerating and tell a twisted tale. ""Scary Monsters"" rocks out, supported by Robert Fripp's absolutely amazing guitar lines. ""Ashes to Ashes"" reveals the fate of Major Tom after he completed his ""Space Oddity"". The rest of the songs are equally compelling. This is not only Bowie's best, but one of the Top 10 albums of the 80's."
2,Flat frights,"2 1/2Occasionally the self-absorbed experimentation does stick, but all too often, which usually is the case for one of rock's flamboyant showman, sounds contrived, pandering, and regimented."
5,One of his best...Listen close,"I've been a loyal fan of Bowie since the late 70's, some of his albums can move you some of them can make you wish you didn't buy them.(They all deserve a listen to...)Scary Monsters has always been a favorite of mine, the creative energyis inspiring and feels right. Give it a few chances........I think DB is feeling the times out, pushing his endless creativity tolevels not seen by artists of his time(Sorry, I'm partial).This album is light years ahead of most modern rock, I thinkyou'll agree."
4,Bowie - Scary Monsters,"It still amazes me how Bowie thinks up some of the sounds and riffs used in this album. The second half of it I can't get into much but the first half is awesome! ""Ashes to Ashes"" rode the charts at number 1 for ages as did the album.The mastering is great too.It features obscure lead guitar by Robert Fripp and Pete Townsend played and contributed to one of the tracks. It's harsh in sound compared to Bowie's more recent work."
4,It's Great!,"I Think Scary Monstes is among Bowie's top albums. the LP is funky, it's electronic, the beats and the melodies are beautiful. His lyrics and authentic voice mixed with all kinds of different instruments make this among the best albums of the early 80's. Includes two of his most loved hits Fashion and Ashes To Ashes among others such as Scary Monsters Super Creeps and more make this album my day. I never get tired of it and the reason why it is fresh and after 20 years it doesn't sound a bit dated. I recomend everyone who wan't to experience Bowie to buy this album It's really really good."
3,BOWIE AT HIS STRANGEST...,"I have to admit that my opinion of this album is largely tainted by the fact that I love the Bowie-Eno trilogy. That said, the title track and ""Ashes to Ashes"" rank up there with Bowie's best. Some of the material kinda goes nowhere, but the lyrics are Bowie at his most clever. ""Fashion"" is a pretty funny jab at the world of pretty faces- I wonder what Bowie's supermodel wife thinks of that song? By the way, listen to ""Crystal Japan"" and shake your head in disgust at the way in which Trent Reznor lifted the melody almost note for note for his own ""A Warm Place""."
2,"Sorry but, I can't stand it!","Ashes to ashes is one of the best songs I've ever heard, but I really can't stand the rest of the album and don't get the hype and love around it. Teenage wildwife, how can you like it? It changes continually, there are too many words, it seems it has no end...I've tried to like this album, but no, it is not for me."
3,David Bowie Meet The 80's......,"Scary Monsters had the full intentions of returning Bowie to his former brilliance, but it falls short. There are too many inconsistencies in between the flashes of greatness. The title track rox as does the nod to Space Oddity Ashes To Ashes, but that's about as far as Bowie goes to make the full comeback from the brink effort. Thoroughly dissapointing but still listenable. Bowie could do a lot worse and so could you. Not the first Bowie album I would buy, but certainly above Young Americans and Station To Station.Dig it!"
5,Benchmark for future work.,"Excellent album. A fullstop to the seventies work that consolidated Glam-Rock and also completes the Berlin period. The man himself says (alas not personally to me)that anytime he releases a new album it is compared to this. ""Fashion"" is harsh and catchy but not as harsh as ""It's No Game #1"". Everything that one might love about Bowie is on this. ""Ashes To Ashes"" is an exorcism of the past and the likes of ""Kingdom Come"" look forward to... um... the 90's when he was worthwhile again. This is still timeless. Too much is going on to date it. Always more than a magpie of other styles, Bowie leaves a template for other, lesser, bands to build into the 80's. Some of it worked and some of it didn't. His new stuff is compared to this because there was such a big gap before he did anything as good again."
4,Finally replaced my vinyl copy:,"I loved this album when it came out in 1980 on vinyl. It's nice to finally have on CD. I consider it the last great Bowie album. Some might say 'Let's Dance' (1983) & 'Tonight' (1984) might be included as great, but I found them a lot more pop/dance orientated. I'll probably get them in time on CD also though. ""Scary Monsters"" has a real rock heart too it.Aside from Tom Verlaine's ""Kingdom Come"", all tracks were written by Bowie. It's noteworthy to mention that Pete Townshend plays guitar on ""Because You're Young"". I love the bookends of ""It's No Game (Part 1)"" and (Part 2). It is one of those album that should be listened to from start to finish in one sitting.I highly recommend this CD."
4,Punched in the gut,"That's how you'll feel when you crank up the bass on this SACD. This is a hybrid disc, so you can play it on regular CD players as well, but to get the full audio range you'll need a SACD player. I'll say it again - SACD and DSD remind me of playing a brand new audiophile vinyl record - there's just something else there that CD can't provide, and SACD blows the doors off of DVD-A. So even if you don't have a SACD player, buy this copy now and hang on to it until you do get one. You can't go wrong with a disc that has ""Ashes to Ashes"" and ""Fashion,"" and the incredible guitar work of Robert Fripp."
1,completely useless,"This sounded too good to be true and it was. It doesn't work at all.It doesn't detect the quick (or absence of quick). For one nail out of 20 (2 dogs, all with longish nails) it indicated it was safe to cut, and then the blades were so dull that the nail tip didn't come off and I had to use scissors to finish the job."
3,Quickfinder May Not Be Quickfix - Seller Great,"While the product appears to be an easy way to find the quick of a pet's nail, it may not be as accurate as you might like. Take special care in using it. Hard to clamp down, and scares pet due to plastic sounds.Seller shipped quickly, and packed well, however. Not the fault of seller, but more the manufacturers need to improve the clamping of the tool, and the accuracy of read."
2,Not worth it...,"This is a nice little concept, but it is definitely not as great as it sounds. I think most people who trim their dogs nails will agree that time is a big factor. Even a well behaved dog doesn't really want you messing with their nails for a long time. This thing has to ""read"" where the quick is which requires holding it over the nail and waiting for it to tell you if it is ok to cut. No such luck in my household of four dogs. About the time it would think about reading... they would wiggle just enough to have to start over. The other problem is the style of clipper. This style tends to splinter the nail leaving rough spots or potentially breaking it off shorter than you intended. I use the scissor type clipper and love the cut - very clean. I guess this type would work with little nails, but all my pooches are large breeds with heavy duty nails. In fact, it wouldn't cut my bloodhound's nails at all. Needless to say, I returned it for a refund."
1,Garbage,My dog has never been so traumatized as when I trusted these clippers to tell me where the quick is in her nail and cut it way too short. We were both crying and there was blood everywhere! The styptic powder only slowed the bleeding after five frantic minutes. It completely stopped after ten minutes. I thought we were going to have to rush her in to the vet for an emergency cauterization. Save yourself some money and trust your own judgment; you can't possibly do a worse job.
1,Do not buy!,Does not perform as advertised. I could see this being used by the CIA as a torture device. It does not cut the nail but more like shatters it and can cause your pet pain. Avoid at all costs.
1,What a piece of garbage!!!,This was the biggest waste of money i have ever spent. Does not work properly!!!!!!!
1,False Hope Money Waster,"The concept of these is awesome. If only it actually worked. I read through the instructions which seemed simple enough. Start at the base of the nail so that the light is red and has a base for where the quick is, move slowly up it will flicker yellow, continue up the nail until it turns green. Great, my husband had a good hold on the squirming dog so that I was able to do all of this. The light meter did exactly as it had described it would do. Green...go! Unfortunately it certainly didn't detect properly and my dog bled all over the place, poor girl. Not only did we feel horrible the dog had to deal with the pain. DO NOT PURCHASE. Gives you a false sense of security."
3,Big and Bulky,I like the concept of the clipper but have found it very bulky to maneuver. My hands are smaller and have a hard time wrapping around the base.My dog also struggles quite a bit as he had been nicked in the past from the groomer and has not forgotten. It is a struggle to do his nails in the first place so any extra time or difficulty in handling the clippers just makes my life more difficult.I love the concept of these clippers BUT found it difficult to use (some of it through no fault of the maker).
1,Gimmick,"Not only does the ""quick finder"" not work, but the blade even sucks!! It wouldn't even clip the nails...only crushed and split the nail. This product should be pulled from the market for misleading advertising. A total waste of money. AMAZON, YOU NEED TO PULL THIS PRODUCT FROM YOUR WEBSITE!!!"
2,Wait for Version 2.0,"I bought this item a while back and was excited at the prospect of it helping me detect the quick so I would not hurt my dog. The problem is you need such a perfect touch for it to work right. You squeeze the handles to get it to work. But-- do it too far and it doesn't work. Do it not quite far enough and it doesn't work. All the while the dog is sitting there, not to happy about the situation. And the result was I probably cut off less than I could have because I didn't really trust the electronics. And if that is the case, don't bother buying this- just get a really good clipper with no gadgetry and be done with it. So wait for version 2.0 - or buy one used a a cheap price so it's okay if it doesn't work well."
1,sensors are horrible,Bought this thinking it would take some of the worry out if doing nails but it only created more. Don't trust the sensor. It might turn red at the very tip of the nail and green at the base. Would love it if this great idea worked.
1,Don't waste your money!,"Blade was dull, green light seemed unreliable, was a horrible clipper all in all, action wasn't smooth and tended to crush my dogs nail...Junk x 2"
1,Double Thumbs Down!!,"The order did arrive very promptly but product was not what was expected. Don't waste your money! I have 2 dogs with black nails. Every time I went to clip their nails, the light would be green until I started to squeeze handle to clip nails. Then the light would turn red. The blade was not very sharp either. I would rather use regular nail clippers and just keep clipping the very tips of black nails (as done at Veterinary)until the nails are short enough without clipping into the quick. Big waste of money."
1,Would not buy these clippers,sorry to say this product didn't work for me at all. I can't even get it to clip my dogs nails even ignoring the light. Which also doesn't work like it's supposed to.
1,poor quality,"the quick find lights do not work as advertised and the cutting of the nail takes some effort. It does not cut very easily,"
2,save your money if you aren't coordinated,"If you can get close to poochie to watch the green or red light AND then take his nails, good luck.Perhaps I just am not coordinated enough to use this high tech tool on my dachshunds..."
1,Don't waste your money.,"It's absolutely worthless! The indicator systems seems to work completely randomly, not reliable at all."
1,Waste of money,"This was a complete waste of money. I bought it thinking it would be great having light sensors to monitor how close to cut. It doesn't cut, it crushes the nail. Very awkard to hold and see what your cutting. I went back to my old nail clippers."
1,Unimpressive product,"Just tried it out, and it didn't work very well. Lights were inconsistent, and the overall device was not sharp enough to really cut very well. I will probably try it again, just to make sure, but so far I couldn't recommend this to anybody."
1,Dog nail clippers,"Do not like this item. Difficult to use, especially on dogs that aren't cooperative in getting their nails clipped. A big bungly to use, at least in my prospetive. Could not always get the light to show me when to clip. I really wouldn't recommend this product. Sorry."
1,DON't BUY!!! It doesn't work at all,"I purchased this at petsmart while on vacation and didn't look at reviews first. Boy am I sorry!! It's awful! It makes this big noise when clipping that scares my dog, so it makes it a struggle when she was never scared before. Then the quick finder flat out does not work. This is going back!!"
1,it is Garbage,"I made 2 big mistakes to buy this so call quickFinder clipper.I rated one star for this review is far too much for it.I myself have 7 dogs, it did not work for any one of my dogs,the RED light keep on lighting regardless of the clipper blade position related to the nail of the dog.Some other times, the green light shows up even I moved the blade past through the middle of the nail, (I could see where the quick is, I just could not imagine what would be happened if I'd close the clipper).the 2nd mistake I made was, I'd bought it from upco.com instead of Amazone, because I had to order some other items from them.I've sent an email to upco for refund on the date I received the parcel, that was about 2 weeks ago now, but still no response yet."
1,Does not work very good,I have for dogs of various nail sizes and thickness and this product did not detect the quick nor cut the nail very disappointed.
1,This product should be banned,"We bought this product very excited to finally not have to be stressed when trimming our dogs nails, the idea for the product is great to bad it's a junk, the balde is dull, the sensors do not work, and it did not cut my dogs nail it split it in half l, my dog is in pain now. DO BUY THIS!"
1,Really? Waste of my time and money...,"I bought the medium size (for dogs 40-75 lbs) for my 27-pound beagle. She has an extra toe and due to her not letting anyone touch that foot, it became infected a few weeks ago. Our vet cut it and treated her and said not to let it grow again. This product was recommended during a PetSmart training class I took my other dog to a few years ago, so I got it to try for her. First of all, her nails are literally over an inch long right now and the light turned red when I got near her paw... not even had her claw in it. I obviously know her quick isn't that long, so I decided to ignore the light and cut her nails just a little. I fought this product to cut her first nail and it barely dug into the second nail. The point of this product is to NOT make cutting the nails painful by cutting into the quick. This product barely cuts at all and started to split her nail because the blade was so dull. Major thumbs down... dissatisfied doesn't even begin to cover it."
1,not as easy as they claim,"i used this with my dog, thinking it would be a fantastic way to avoid cutting the quick and hurting him. boy was i wrong. do not trust this product and its lights - i clipped when the light turned green, my dog yelped, and started bleeding :("
1,not sharp enough,It just cracks the nails and doesn't cut them-not sharp enough. I emailed the company and got no reply.
1,A total waste of money,"The lights take turns flashing and are inaccurate. Actually hurt my dog using it because I trusted the green light. A great idea, but it doesn't work well at all."
2,Quick Finder Nail Clipper,"Blade was very dull and split my dog's nail rather than cutting it. Also, the light indicator is not very easy to use. I would not recommend this product at all."
5,Highly recommended,"Although this topic has been covered in other books, journals, and studies, Nonverbal Communication in the Workplace is one of the few that stands out from the rest. Its coverage the basics is a pithy and straight-forward -- fantastic for a beginner.The author skillfully discusses the various areas of nonverbal communication in the workplace while delightfully engaging readers further into this complicated subject with clever and witty illustrations.A perfect addition to anyone's library!"
2,"It's a pamphlet, not a book","I sent this back to amazon when it arrived. It's a glorified pamphlet, not a book. It didn't seem worth the $10. The content might be OK, but realize what you're buying."
4,"Looks great, not so comfortable","I feel like a girl in this shoe. It's a sharp-looking shoe, but it is not something you want to go for a long walk with."
2,"Its ok for the money, but far from terrific.","I bought one of these for my father, a retired electrician who occasionally still takes jobs. At first, he loved this little drill. The only shortcomings he noticed in the beginning were the lack of a keyless chuck and the fact that the paddle-switch could be dangerous if you weren't paying close attention to what you were doing. In the end though, what became this drills downfall was the cheap construction inside the housing. After only a few jobs, a plastic component around the motor cracked, allowing the teeth to slip under strain. A DeWalt service shop charged... to fix this problem. The second hole it drilled after that caused the gears to give out. It was a great idea, but DeWalt needs to send this one back to the design board for more work... I wish now that I had spent the extra money on the bigger DeWalt right angle drill."
1,Poorly designed w/little features,"I'm an Industrial Technology teacher and have access to many new tools. I am very disappointed with this Dewalt Product. I still don't understand why they didn't put a reversable switch on this unit. It would have been great for installing and removing Kitchen cabinets. Moreover, when using spade bits to drill through flooring, you periodically need to ""back"" the bit up to remove it when it becomes bound. I think a better purchase would be a temporary 90 degree chuck that mounts to a portable drill. Be very careful when setting this unit on the ground ... it's super easy to hit the start switch and if you've got a large spade bit in the chuck ""watch out!!"" I also would like to see a variable speed adjustment as this drill does create a lot of torque and can easy twist and sprain you wrist if you're not anticipating it."
2,Full time construction worker,"I own this particular drill, although it is a powerful drill for a compact right angle drill, the major draw back for me is the non-reversing feature. What I have needed to use it for mostly is driving in screws in compact areas such as the inside of cabinets. If there is a need to remove the screw for adjustment of what you are working with you are really up a creek. Other than that it is also not variable speed which is not critical but would definitely be a plus if it were variable speed. I would recommend the makita model although not as powerful it has all the things the dewalt model lacks. P.S. A friend of mine has this drill and while trying to change the bit with the drill plugged in accidentally hit the trigger driving the chuck key deep into his hand. VERY PAINFUL!"
1,The switch on this 90 is dangerous.,The plastic gard around the chuck is strange and there is no reverse. It might be ok for wood.
5,How did I live without this?,"While remodeling my home, we were taking up the floor boards on the second floor, so we could access the electric to the first floor ceiling fans. The house is old and still had gas pipe in the floors from the old 'gas lighting', and to add to the confusion it still had the knob and tube wiring. Needless to say it was tight working between the joists. Thats were the DeWalt DW160 came in....it fit down inbetween the joists nicely, and had enough power to get the job done. As mentioned in another review, and keyless chuck would have been great, but other than that this drill is a great thing to have around."
1,Finger Pincher,"I recently purchased the DeWalt DW160V, the drill works ok but the shroud around the chuck with the three openings to access the chuck is a dangerous hazard because it creates a bad pinch point, I am a Millwright of more than 40 years and have used the Black & Decker Industrial but this was not on them and should have been left off because instead of making it safer it was made more hazardous."
1,DANGEROUS,I consider this one of the most dangerous tools in my shop and will soon be replaced. This tool was poorly designed and is unsafe.
3,it works,What can I say its an enclosure.... I would have given it 5 stars but it was bent out of the box.
4,Huge fan of Roseanne,I have always been a big fan of Roseanne because it was my mothers favorite show when I was younger. So I always get anything I find with her in it. This movie was pretty good but a big change compared to her show.
1,I couldn't get it to work properly,I bought this card so that I could play Oblivion. The card would freeze up after a few minutes of play. It would also freeze up with normal use (Word or email). I emailed their support and they got back to me after a few days. By that time I discovered that my son had a card I could use. I don't know what the problem was but I couldn't get it to work properly.
2,Poor PureVideo Performer,"If you've bought an Nvidia card for the video capabilities before, then you know how difficult it can be to figure out what the ""PureVideo"" branding actually connotes. It's a blanket term used on many of the latest Nvidia cards, and what the card actually offers can vary. Sadly, I found this out the hard way.This card can do some decoding well. It enhances progressive mpeg 2 video terrifically, exactly what you'd hope it would look like. But this card deinterlaces terribly! The much touted automatic deinterlacing wasn't properly implemented, and when turned on makes the video excessively shimmer. I've tried every option in the Nvidia control panel and different driver versions, and nothing will fix it. I instead purchased a Radeon HD 3650 and found it deinterlaces terrifically."
4,A Good Card For Some Systems....,"A good card for updating an older system but has it limits when using on newer ones. It works fine for me as I needed a upgrade from a 6200. One good thing is that NiVidia driver updates normally include a number of models in there updates and both the 6200 and the 7600 drivers are included in the lastest set. Overall, not a bad card."
4,Koala baby sun yellow crib skirt,It's a nice cotton fabric.It's a good quality item for the money. The color was not what I expected it to be. I thought by looking at the picture that it would be a brighter yellow. Although I like the item it does not work for our baby's nursery.
4,Very Cute!,"I have this in red for our son and I'm also going to buy it in yellow to switch out. He has a curious george room and it really makes the colors pop and the room look finished. It washes really good too! Definetely not a must, but a nice addition!"
4,Great Off Season Preparation,"This video, like the previous video of the same title, provides some great off-season hunting action. Ken Wilson does a great job of providing the viewer with ""side-line"" action. In addition, the video provides information that will help hunters both experienced and novices in judging the trophy qualities of the various animals to be hunted. A pleasure to watch."
5,Heavy Duty Contractor Grade Drill,"I purchased this model instead of the cheaper DeWalt 3/8"" drill because I wanted something to handle the abuse I will give it. Used it to build a very large wooden outdoor fort and swingset for my boys and loved it. Had no problem with using 1 1/8"" spade bit to drill counterbores. Plenty of power."
5,Extremely happy with this drill,"I have about 10 corded and cordless drills. I enjoy the handiness of the cordless drill, but I love this corded Dewalt.I have a small home repair business, so I use power tools all of the time. After I graduated to the cheap drills, I tried a Makita. It was fine, and handled well, but died after only a couple of years. That soured me on the brand. So the next drill I bought was this Dewalt.It's a workhorse. It handles everything I've thrown at it. Very highly recommended."
2,Way too powerful for our needs,"We bought this drill to upgrade from our weaker, cordless drill. I'm a 25 year old woman, with quite a bit of experience with power tools, and this was just way too strong for me. The version we got didn't have variable speeds, as some folks mention in their reviews. The speed was only: crazy high. It kept slipping out of our screws, and was impossible to use unless you were in a position to put all of your body weight into it. Heading back to the hardware store to exchange for a variable speed drill.Good luck!"
1,Wrestling Joke,I rate this video as poor. It was acomplete waste of time and consider these matches as a joke and filmed in a barn.
2,Was NOT worth the wait!!!,I truthfully have to say the best thing about this item is the DVD Menu Selection Screen.... that's it!!!
5,NOT 'Lo-Fi' at all,"TIARA has created a monster-masterpiece with their third full-length album, TITLETRON. With a wide range of song styles from Beatles to Radiohead to The Left Banke, TIARA sets the listener up for a seamless 40 minute ride thru music history. While most pegged 'indie-rock' type bands fall short of eclipsing their influences, TIARA never seems to be worried about this. Strong songs like 'Wish You Away' show the progress TIARA has made as songwriters, and the recording fidellity is excellent. Anyone who thinks this is Lo-Fi has got to be crazy. Anyway, pick this up if you enjoy great songs, good instrumentation and unique rock 'n' roll. Columbus OHIO is lucky to call these guys home."
3,Timeless Tiara Pictures,Let us be clear- this is a picture book. Beautiful pictures but just pictures. This book contains very little text. If you like detailed photo captions or historical background information you will be disappointed with this book. But for a photo overview of the wide variety of styles and designs in headgear this is a great resource.
3,Corporate absolution - again!,"Yes, divorce is taking a toll on children all across America. But Whitehead's analysis is another version of ""blaming the victim"" not the causes. In this case, the victims are families themselves. If we are sincere about forging stronger family bonds, we need to address those causal issues which really tear at the core of family stability and health -- maldistribution of wealth in America, underpaid and dead-end jobs, the consumer culture, and corporate tax evasion. The divorce culture is really an artifact of where corporate America has been taking us for the last few decades. To insist that families must simply swallow their angst and try harder to stay together is to miss the whole point -- and dispense absolution on the guilty parties"
5,A Must Have Meatloaf,If you like Meatloaf this is a must have. This one has his classic hits as performed in the 80's. This is a keeper.
5,Almost everything I expected,"Almost everything I expected, but I missed ""Dead Ringer for Love"" together with Cher.I had this one on videotape, and I'm pretty sure that one was included.But I love this dvd anyway!!"
3,Works but...,"This is the only replacement paddle I have ever been able to find for my Breadman. I've replaced several pans as the coating wore off, but the manufacturer does not sell replacement paddles. All of the non-stick coating had worn off my old paddle causing the bread to stick to it. This made the bread more difficult to remove from the pan and also left a large hole in the loaf of bread. This replacement paddle is not made by the original manufacturer (nor does the description say that it is) and it does not fit well over the shaft in the bread pan. I had to use a hammer and padded screwdriver to get it to go down the shaft most of the way. It will not come off, but it still works well and does not stick to my bread. I have to use a very small brush to clean under the paddle when I wash the bread pan."
2,Breadman paddle,The paddle would not fit on the Breadman breadmaker shaft until I filed the hole larger.As shipped it would not fit on the shaft all the way and came off when turning the dough.
3,Might Not Be Right For Breadman TR2200C,"This paddle works OK, I guess, but it ends up more deeply inside the loaf than the original. It doesn't fit all the way down on the shaft, leaving a space of 3/16"" or so. You might want to look elsewhere if you have the TR2200C bread maker."
2,Doesn't work on our machine,"We checked and double-checked to make sure this paddle would fit our Breadman Ultimate. While the description said that it would, turns out that it didn't fit. We were successfully refunded our purchase price, but we still were out shipping and handling."
1,Where in the world did you outsource this part?,This paddle is a disaster. We have made only a couple of loaves of bread and the paint is bubbling up and peeling off the paddle. Please look for another manufacturer. The original paddle that came with the Breadman did not do this.
2,Did buy the wrong paddle,After reading the reviews and the description I mistakenly thought this item would work on the Breadman Ultimate TR2500BC. It looks like it should. It does not. I don't think Amazon carries a paddle for this particular breadmaker. FYI.
3,Great service- but wrong description,"I ordered this, received it, then received a refund.The company provided great service - but This paddle DOES NOT fit the TR2200C model machine - it comes off during the knead process. I have been unable to find any replacement paddles for this model of the Breadman so have returned to kneading dough by hand."
3,"Paddle is fine, but not description","I ordered to obtain a replacement paddle for my Breadman Ultimate TR-4000, which this paddle was purported to fit. It clearly does not. The paddle comes off the spindle repetitively during the dough kneadingcycle."
2,Reading other customer reviews saves time-TR2500BC,"The bread paddle was supposed to fit my bread machine (TR2500BC) and it has an ever so slightly too small shaft hole. So I returned it. Another person wrote the same review 13 months ago, oh well, my bad. And 13 months later the product description still says the paddle fits TR2500BC. I give this 2 stars because by now the product description should have been corrected."
1,Wrong part,"Be advised that although this part looks identical, it does not work with Breadman TR2700. The part doesn't go down all the way and will jiggle loose when used. I am returning it."
5,Just what I needed.,"The replacement part I ordered is a perfect fit and does what is is supposed to do. The Teflon surface does not allow the bread to stick as it bakes, allowing the loaf to slip out of the pan with no problem."
2,TR2500BC?,"This paddle does NOT fit the TR2500BC as the product description says. The paddle in the picture (circle with one side cut off) would be the proper shape. The paddle I received is a circle with two sides cut off. Called Goodman's and they said they do not even carry a paddle for my machine? Going straight through Breadman now, as I should have initially...they will issue a refund when I return it, but it is a pain in the butt. Know when you are ordering this that it is NOT the paddle in the picture and will not fit pans with a notch this shape - like the TR2500BC!"
2,TR2200C -- paddle looks like it fits but is off by one....,i tlooks like it fits and when I put it in the machine it was slightly off. by the second knead it came flying off the sprocket and into the bread. the paddle does not work 100% with TR2200C. I am still looking someone who will sell me a replacement paddle. my machine is perfectly good. I hate to throw it away just because we lost the paddle.
1,Problem's NOT the paddle!,"It's a whole new PAN you need. And Salton doesn't MAKE REPLACEMENTS. Does that mean Black & Decker, George Foreman, Russell Hobbs, Toastmaster, LitterMaid, and Farberware and all brandname products of APN Holding Company, Inc., the parent of Applica Incorporated & Salton are junk? There's so many GOOD products available on the internet, why take chances? Just went to their website, no mention of any recall..."
1,Make Sure This Is what's needed.,I bought this becase I saw that it was loose on the shaft... When I got the new paddle turns out the shaft itself is worn not the paddle...
1,Don't get this unit,"rather get the DW272. I don't know if it was an isolated instance, but I couldn't keep the nose assembly tight. I believe the threads were stripped, and it wouldn't stay tight.The DW272 has not had the same problem. When I purchased it, my instinct said ""plastic isn't durable and it looks like it could be weak at the nose"", and well in this case it proved to be true.I certianly wouldn't rate the DeWalt tools based on the quality of this drill/driver...they make better products, I own many...and will continue to buy them."
1,very disappointed,"Bought this item new, never tried it because the nose piece was so cheep!!!! Could not adjust tip for drywall, could only set screws to deep. Plastic tip wouldn't even stay on screw gun and never used, what happens when if you used it at all the time. Big trouble if you ever dropped it by accident. I'am sending it back. I love all my other tools from Dewalt, would back them all up, but this one. I hope this isn't the way Dewalt is going with there products."
2,Songs that require maturity,"Ms. Church has included on this album some of the most stirring songs every written. However, the lack of expression on her part is disheartening, though understandable. Ms. Church has wonderful potential to be a great singer, but she is not such now, and the overuse of her young voice is only to her detriment. Although many of these pieces are vocally easier than those in her classical repertoire, she lacks the emotional maturity to really be expressive. Like so many young athletes, dancers, actors, etc...she is more a pretty face at the moment than a mature performer. I don't think this album is worth purchasing."
1,Can I Rip out her vocal cords???,"Man, i am tellin you, this hshould be rated a quarter out of five!! (...)She sounds like an elf when she sings. She can't even go up that high, and she always changes her chords. DEF. NOT A SINGER, and i wouldn't be surprised if she didn't have any other talents. If anyone buys this cd, it would be like buying a skunks head in a tuna fish sandwich, dipped in mallasas, squished underneath a 1000 pound elephant's foot, with tons of 100 year old gravy, and a rotten cherry on top. Cuz that's how much it STINKS!!!!"
1,This is not music .. it's hype,"Please, wake up! If you want to hear a great voice on a ""little"" girl, go re-listen to Judy Garland. Maybe Andrea McArdle. (...) She has NO business singing most of the songs she's attempting here. There is no interpretation, no texture or substance to her voice. She rarely is on pitch. Don't be mad at me -- or her. She's just a kid trying to sing grownup songs. I'm just trying to point that out. She should stick to what she CAN do -- falsetto-like ditties that won't offend anyone who thinks she's a musician. She's a kid. (...)"
1,Amateur Hour,"With so many top notch singers under contract to them, I can only wonder why Columbia would bring such an amateur sounding young lady as Charlotte Church in to sing some of the finest material to have ever worn its label. Charlotte will always seems out of place unless she is part of a choir. She simply does not have the emotion and vocal range to be a success as a vocal artist. I heard the song Habanera and wondered if she may have burst a blood vessel trying to reach some of the notes. While she can be somewhat pleasant when singing Christmas Carols, she appears incredibly inept when attempting anything else. The CD Enchantment is a total waste of your money. As for Charlotte, it would be nice if we could put her in a shiny box, tie a red ribbon around it and leave a note which says, ""Don't Open Until Christmas""."
1,Andreas,"At 12 her voice was as a miracle; however, at 15 her voice is only just promising.This work is suited only for the sort of person such as BBC's Keeping Up Appearances' Mrs. Bucket. It's Muzak for the pretentious. Not for the serious music lover.Miss Church, at a younger age, was precocious; however, one wonders if she can spell Bach or Mozart; never mind possessing the knowledge of who they were. She's failed to mature or to increase her talent.Time to either put this one out to pasture, or get her some training."
1,Disenchantment,"After listening to about half of this album, I was shocked to hear how far Charlotte's voice has deteriorated since her 3rd album. Whether it came from abuse or puberty, the fact is that she cannot sing the type of songs which this album presents. A possbile exception would be with Carrickfergus where she seems to hold her own. Otherwise, what the listener hears is little more than a High School rendition. In the future she needs to be more careful in her selection of music if she is to keep the favor of the listening public."
1,Disappointment not Enchantment,"I was very disappointed with this album. It was most certainly not the ""best"" of Charlotte Church! I was expecting the same quality that was found on her earlier albums but it was just not there. The singing felt very mechanical and had no depth. I would rather have heard the original artists sing the songs she did!"
2,Strictly for fans only,"Some of the singing in this CD is quite pleasant. After all, Charlotte Church's voice has a sort of innocent charm. Unfortunately, she always sings in a sort of whitish and naive tone, which just won't do for many of the more mature songs. More worryingly is her tremulously tonal emission and the failure to develop into a larger and more solid voice as she ages. Indeed, vocal emission is often annoyingly constricted and the singing therefore loses its emotional force. The big error in the planning of this CD is in the inclusion of Carmen's Habanera and the Laughing Song. In the former, Church conveys the impression of an 8 year old girl trying to put on her mother's make-up. Her singing of the higher passages of the latter is extremely embarrassing for both the singer and her admirers. I take it that it's not intended as a joke and I really feel sorry for her and angry at the CD producers. Strictly for Church's fans only."
1,Enchantment,"Like most of the rest of the people who have reviewed this record, I am not enchanted. 3 of my favorite songs, The Little Horses, The Water is Wide, and Somewhere were among the selections performed by Charlotte Church in this CD. In lieu of repeating what so many others have already said, it will suffice to say that Charlotte doesn't have near the maturity to attempt songs such as are presented here. I would like her to try again in about 10 to 15 years when her voice is matured much like Sarah Brightman's did. I'm certain that at least a few of these songs would then be acceptable. Until then, she should avoid such as is included here."
1,how was this able to be released?,Charlotte church is terrible!! is this what they call a classical voice nowadays? she has no sense of musicality! and yet people buy it?
3,"Decent, but concerned about her voice","Enchantment is beautiful. It's the only Charlotte Church CD I own, and I enjoy it very, very much. I think her voice is beautiful, but I'm slightly concerned that maybe she's reaching too far too soon without the proper training. Her voice sounds strained in places. I haven't heard Charlotte Church's other CDs, so I can't compare. Too much too soon will mess with your vocal cords, and I think that's what's happening here. I hope she slows down, because she does have a beautiful voice! As for the CD, it's still very enjoyable. Not for hardcore listeners of this genre, but for the ordinary listener, it's great and well-worth the money.BEST SONG: The Prayer, with Josh Groban"
1,A Long Way From Greatness,"After spending years listening to some of the greatest contemporary singers in the world, listening to Miss Charlotte Church on this album Enchantment was quite a disappointment. There are so many weak areas in her vocals that it is a wonder that she was allowed to sing such demanding songs at her age. Singers such as Fleming, TeKanawa, Battle, Brightman, etc. took considerable time to evolve to the point where they could cover the songs in this album. Its a shame that such great material was wasted on someone who is nowhere near the point where she would be capable of singing them. Hopefully Miss Church has taken note of those criticisms of her singing and will wait until such time as she is capable of an acceptable rendering before another attempt. This CD is recommended to music teachers and students as an example of how NOT to sing classic songs."
2,Delightful voice but...,"Unquestionably Charlotte Church has a phenomenal voice for her age, however, she is a bit out of her league with many of the selections here. In ""If I Loved You,"" and ""Laughing Song,"" oneeagerly waits for her to launch into the depths of these wonderful pieces, but she doesn't quite get there. A bit like trying to fly an ultra-light alongside a B52. ""Bali Ha'i"" has the desired dreamy quality, and the orchestrations are marvelous.It would be interesting if Miss Church would re-record these in ten years."
5,"""ASTOUNDING""","I thought this album was absolutely the best. I know it is not totally opera but she has such an amazing voice you will fall in love with it on the first song! I did!!! I loved ""The Flower Duet"" I don't care what type of music she is singing.She is ""ENCHANTING"" You gotta love this one."
1,Who Is She Singing For?????,"I listened to about 10 of the songs in this CD and without a doubt they were the most uninspired cold-sounding covers ever sung. It was if Charlotte was singing from a hymnal, learning the material as she went along. On some of the songs, it sounds as if there is a different singer singing. Or else Charlotte had a cold on the day she recorded those songs. I mean they are REALLY BAD. Also, I cannot imagine why she would try and sing a song like Habanera, where her voice is not even close to the octaves where many of the notes are sung. She sounds as if she is dying when she reaches for those notes. However, actually, you can assess her ability by simply listening to the last song in the CD, which is ""The Prayer"" On this one, she is literally blown right out of the studio by Josh Groban, who demonstrates what type of voice is needed for material which has been included in Enchantment. But Groban's voice on just one song is not worth the price of this CD."
5,Astounding,"I have been crying for three days over this cd. Slightly teary on Carrickfergus, tapping along for Habanera, and with the first notes of The Water Is Wide, practically bawling. Normally, I am not a sentimentalist. Nor am I a fan of opera or show tunes. So why am I listening to a cd full of opera and show tunes? That voice. And Jesse Cook. His distinct arrangements and guitar really get the music moving. (Try his cd Gravity if you like the guitar and percussion work on this cd -- which, of course, you're buying because it's clear from every review that it's a must-have.)"
5,Simply beautiful.,There is not much to say except that Charlotte Church is magnificent and this new album is astounding. I don't see how anyone could be displeased with this beautiful CD.
4,Enchanted,This CD is exactly what you would expect. ALL of the songs are beautiful! My personal favorites are The Little Horses and Carrickfergus. If you're looking for something soothing or if you looking for something sing aloud this CD is it!
3,wait anther few years,"Ms Church has a marvelous instrument in her throat,but this material is beyond her,if only for now;perhaps by the time she hits 18-20 she will beable to handle it better.Right now, she sounds like an extremely talentedteen trying too hard to be the next Streisand.If her 'handlers' want to lead her down this pathshe would be better advised to eschew 'covers'and display her talents while avoiding undue comparisons."
1,"BOO, HISS!! Kid Butchers Repertoire!!","Charlotte Church...the International sensation...SO WHAT?The kid, though with a lovely voice, butchers these songs, which some might I add, are way too difficult for her to be singing at this age ( Lakme's Flower Duet, Carmen's Habanera ). The rock beat interpretations, that I can handle, but not the complete disregarding of proper style, technique and singing procedures.The Bali Ha'i is WAY too low for her, and the high notes on the Habanera stink. It's obvious that they have been digitally enhanced.However, I suppose this is where music in America is heading, but if you want to hear a GOOD version of the Habanera ( though it won't have the synthesizer background ), check out Maria Callas's version. She does it correctly and it sounds better too...Poor Charlotte Church...hope she saves her money now...I'm willing to bet that her voice is shot by thirty...."
1,Tough to Rate,"After listening to a multitude of different divas, including Streisand, Fabian, Battle, Brightman, & Fleming, I find it very difficult to rate Charlotte Church. The main reason is that none of the aforementioned Divas began any type of commercial recording at Church's age. It would stand to reason that she would improve in another 4 years (Streisand started at 19) but at this moment she is at the bottom of the roster, ability wise, at least with respect to the songs attempted in Enchantment. However, I would suggest to anyone seriously considering buying these songs, that they review some of the above adult singers first and then decide if Charlotte meets your expectations. I did not find her meeting mine, YET, on Enchantment."
3,Charlotte..... What has happened with your voice????,"Charlotte's release ""Enchantment"" is very different from her previous work, and i do like, but man the songs she tried to sing is way out of her range. ""The laughing song"", is a very difficult song (which by the way should have been in German), when she comes to the high D, she sounds like shes straining. ""Habanera"" is for a Mezzo-Soprano, and she is yet a Mezzo, and when she gets high, she sounds like shes dying. Her coloratura is very airy, and her vibrato in ""Habanera"" is very unbalanced, and very thin. ""Carrickfergus"" was the kinda songs she should stick with, and i do admit ""The water is wide"" brings tears to my eyes. But Charlotte please get a new vocal teacher and get ur act together. I would love to see u putting out albums in the near future. I rate this as 3 stars, for she tried to make a classic album, and that she did, but without the vocal capabilities."
3,"Not as enchanting as I thought it would be, but nice try!","I liked it way better when Charlotte sang Christian music such as""Pie Jesu"" or ""The Lord's Prayer"". Now shes singing songs like ""Can't help lovin' dat man"". It's a very good song, but its not like Charlotte's type. None of these songs are like Charlotte, exept ""The Prayer"". All the songs are well and beautifully sang, however. Nice Try, Charlotte!!!!"
4,A new change for the young artist,"I must say that I enjoyed this album very much. Many of the songs are catchy and seem to be, in comparison to Charlotte's past repetoire, more fitting for her age.I am glad to see that she has entered the classic broadway world. She has also started singing some celtic songs that are absolutely beautiful. I think that Charlotte is heading in the right direction as far as repetoire. This young lady was thrown heavy classical music at such a young age when her voice was not close to being fully mature. This may be the reason for the thinning in her voice upon entering the lower register. It doesn't quite have the same quality as her higher notes; however, over all the CD is enjoyable, and I would recommend people to buy it."
1,Hearing is Believing,"It was hard for me to believe that Charlotte Church had digressed so far from her earlier days, so I took a listen to her first album to see if my recollection was correct. And it appears that it was. She doesn't seem to have near the volume in her voice, nor the enthusiasm in her singing. Its as if she is depressed over the fact that she has lost much of her voice and is simply plowing her way through the line-up of melodies which has been prepared for her. She needs to regain some of that which she has lost before venturing into the type of songs in Enchantment. They take a lot more than what she is apparently able to offer right now. She needs to re-assess her career right now and make some changes if she is to survive."
1,BaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaD,I cannot believe that the girl singing this album is an opera star. This must be some sort of a joke.
3,What is the big deal?,"I bought Voice of An Angel and while I thought her voice on some tracks was beautiful, I would practically cringe hearing her on some others such as ""Amazing Grace."" I realized it wasn't that she was astonishingly talented in general, but talented for a twelve year old. I swore I would never buy another Charlotte Church CD. I thought she was extremely overrated. But I received Enchantment as a gift and my opinion hasn't changed. I thought ""am I missing something here?"" I still thinks its just that she's so young. A 30 year old with her voice wouldn't stand a chance. I'm not an expert - in fact, I know nothing about voice, so I was relieved to read opinions from those that are musically trained that seemed to echo my own."
4,Great Songs,This is an album with great songs... well selected and well produced. My only comment is that the quality of Charlotte's singing has somewhat deteriorated a little... it seems that she's singing better when she was 12. She still sings great and I guess we have to attribute that Charlotte is getting older. Great album and still great singing.
5,best one so far,"Although I'm not a big fan of Charlotte Church, this is definitely her best CD yet. Great selection and arrangments! ALthough she says (according to the insert) that she felt that she was not ready to perform the Flower Duet, I think she may have been underestimating herself - it is superb! Other favorites are Habanera and Papa Can You Hear Me?But my favorite has to be The Prayer. Her clasical/opera training combined with the right amount of pop gives her version of The Prayer (with the equally wonderful Josh Groban) a wonderful and unique quality.All in all, she has definitely grown up and this is evident in this CD."
2,Charlotte's Worst,I have all of Charlotte's c.d.s and this is the worst one she produced...Don't get me wrong Charlotte is still the little girl with the BIG voice but the material she sings on this c.d. is just un-suitable for her and definately not her style...If you want to try a Church c.d buy Charlotte's Voice of An Angel or her self titled album....I did however find some favorite tracks the duet that she sung with Josh Groban encouraged me to buy Josh Groban's c.d...I have to give her at least one star and I'll give her another for effort...Perhaps her label should give her some better material for she still has the voice of an angel.
3,Growing Up Is Hard To Do!,"I admire Charlotte's attempt to expand her repertoire. I was a little disappointed with some of the results.She has a splendid voice. But, some of the songs may be too mature for her. Life experience can add a great deal to the interpretation of a song. Its not just singing words, its conveying emotion. Charlotte's not quite there yet.I hope the people around her rethink just what they do with her career. She's in-between! The joy of the little girl with a great voice is no longer an attraction. Allow her to continue to develop her talents as she grows up. Find her, quality songs that fit her current age, talents and experience."
5,Its a must,I think that Charlotte has come a long way from the first poorly recorded creations form SONY. This is well done all the way. A nice set of choices and lovely arrangements.
5,Love it!,"Ok, I know many say her voice has become worse, but i don't think so. She's learned you don't have to scream higher notes. She has more control over her voice, which is still lovely. She may not be a true opera singer, but she is only 15 on this, and for a 15 year old, she does pretty darn good. I love the songs and her voice and would recommend this to anyone."
5,I love it,"I just got this today,and it is wonderful. I've liked Charlotte since I saw her on PBS awhile back,but this album surpasses all the others. My favorite is Carrickfergus, which is so soothing and beautiful. Buy this,you won't regret it."
1,prodigy no more,"Though Charlotte Church was indeed something to be impressed with as a child, her credibility as a young woman singing classical repetoire is doubtful. I have no qualms with whether or not material is ""age appropriate"", I'm merely concerned with whether or not the singer can present the music as the composer envisioned. Unfortunately, Charlotte Church, when singing songs like The Flower Duet from Lakme, cannot.I listened to this CD expecting an example of matured talent and technical expertise. Instead I found a girl fighting to preserve the vastly acclaimed sound she produced so easily in her youth. If she took a moment to step back and evaluate, she would realize that such a thing is no longer possible. With age must come credible maturity."
2,Ick,"Charlotte Church has neither the voice nor the depth needed for much of this material. She has no buisness trying to sing opera at age 15-- not only does it sound unpleasant, she's going to ruin her voice.Oh, BTW, for the definitive version of ""Can't help Lovin' Dat Man,"" check out Ella Fitzgerald's version on her ""Jerome Kern Songbook."" FItzgerald had no vocal training at any point during her life, but her voice is superior to almost anyone else's-- many opera singers have admired her perfect pitch and intonation (something that CC certainly does not have. ;-))"
4,Don't get me wrong,"Ok, so I really like Charlotte Church. But I have a feeling that by singing as much as she is at such a young age, she's going to end up doing to her voice what Liza and Julie did. Charlotte is pretty good, and I love it when she sings opera, but she lacks a little when it comes to the Broadway songs. It's pretty, but her inflection is wrong. I think she should just stick to the Opera and classical. She's good at it, so why not stick with it?"
3,"Good, But Not Enchanting","This compilation fails to live up to its title and Miss Church's reputation. However, it is still a solid album and, for fans of Charlotte's or those that are not self-acclaimed classical music critics, it provides a very enjoyable listen. Keeping in mind that the artist is ""only"" 15 and serves as a positive counter-cultural role-model in a society currently dominated by 15-year-old celebrities of much less candor and charm should only enhance the pleasure you receive from each track.As an additional minor criticism, I found the album's apparent sole theme (songs that Charlotte likes) somewhat clumsy. I would have preferred that she grouped her songs more logically (e.g., an album of traditional Welsh music, another of broadway hits, etc.)As another reviewer noted, ""Habanera"" stands out as a definite gem. I also greatly enjoyed ""The Laughing Song"" and ""The Prayer."""
4,enchantment,"At first I was a little disappointed but after further reveiw I find it better than the first time I listened. I enjoyed greatly Habannera and I enjoy the fact that Charlotte uses all her voice for this song. I also enjoyed The Little Horses, and overall it is worth the money and it better be as I bought one and got one for a Chritmas present. As I read reveiws I believe I'm one of the fewer and fewer people who notice the uniqueness of young Charlottes' voice. I wish her continued success and look forward to her next release."
4,Total Enchantment!,"All the bashing is unreal here. Yes, I like opera. I listen to Maria Callas and Renée Fleming. Charlotte isn't an opera singer, she never has been, and she doesn't plan to be one right now. 'Habanera' might not be what you're used to, but it's got a fun flamenco guitar and a great beat. She does a fantastic job on the 'Flower Duet' from Lakmé. She does both Lakmé and Mallika's parts. 'Carrickfergus' is perfect for her voice, and she does it wonderfully. 'Adele's Laughing Song' is an admirable attempt, she does get a little airy when she hits the high notes at the end, but that's understandable, because she was only 15 when this was recorded. Her duet with Josh Groban is beyond fantastic, they mesh wonderfully. 'Papa Can You Hear Me?' is another highlight, she sounds perfect in this one. This is a wonderful album, and you'll be truly enchanted."
5,Beautiful voice for a teen,This CD is beautiful. It's a pleasure listening to a young woman that actually has talent and a wonderful singing voice. If only the people slamming Miss Church's vocal abilities would write bad reviews for non-talented young singers like Britney Spears!
1,What Happened?,"When I first heard Charlotte sing, I was expecting to be following her on the way up. After listening to 10 of the songs on Enchantment, it appears that I will be following her on the way out. Its difficult to believe that any girl her age could lose so much of her voice in such a short time. I mean she sounds no different than any girl who might step out of a choir.I have noticed in recent appearances that she appears with Tony Bennett frequently. Maybe the two have decided to go out together. Both are a shell of their former selves. At least we had her at her best for a few years. Its a shame, though, that she couldn't have grown up to be another Sarah Brightman. The music world needs someone like that."
1,No Soul,Charlotte Church's singing is just like her character; no Heart and no Soul. Its not surprising that this CD is the last in her contract. She sings like she wants to be out of here. Good. Everyone in the music biz wants her out too. Please let this be the last of Charlotte Church
1,Too Immature,"This was a good attempt by Charlotte Church to sing some really nice songs from movie's etc. But as others have said, she just doesn't have the strength or range to cover all 15 of the songs. These songs were tailor made for mature divas like the ones who originally sang them. I believe the only people who will enjoy this album are those who want to hear everything that Charlotte sings."
1,Charlotte Church's Enchantment,"If few of today's 18-to-25-year-old divas can deliver pop hits with any real maturity, how should a girl of 15 be exepcted to tackle standards that have daunted artists 3 times her age. That is the basic conundrum underlying Church's new CD on which the very young singer takes on arias, folk ballads, and show tunes that demand more technical and emotional authority than she can muster. Her light, breathy soprano has neither the depth necessary for a flamenco-laced ""Habanera"", (a number written for a Mezzo) nor the fluidity or wit required for the coloratura showcase, ""The Laughing Song"". And Church's readings of musical-theatre favorites such as ""Tonight"", ""If I Loved You"" and ""Can't Help Lovin Dat Man"" has a stiff, self-conscious quality that suggests a student auditioning for the high school musical - which would probably be a more appropriate, safer forum for Church's modest still-tender talents."
5,Pure Excellence,"I have been a fan of Charlotte Church for quite sometime now, and her latest release is, in my opinion, fantastic. Her voice is so much more rich and full, truly a delight to listen to. I was also pleased that Josh Groban sang, ""The Prayer"" with Charlotte, it is such a beatiful song, and Josh Groban is such a magnificent singer, the song is quite beautiful. Charlotte is very young, she is trying new things, its only natural, for the only way to find out if something works is to TRY IT OUT! I respect her for this, and at fifteen she seems very mature and responsible, I don't think we have another Britany Spears on our hands. I say let her try new things, and if they don't work out, she will do what she thinks best. I am still a fan, and I will remain a fan, no matter what happens. I am thouroghly enjoying,""Enchantment"", Its a shame that not everyone agrees with me. None the less, 5 stars."
2,I like her songs but not these,I guess there should be more suitable songs that she could sing beautifully and that the listeners could listen comfortably like the songs in her previous CDs. I wonder why she had to choose Habanera. Is she going to shift her professionalism as a classical singer to other kinds?I hope she will be back on the right track in her next CD.
2,Unmoved by the singing,"I don't know anything about technique and those profound musical arguments. I only judge one's singing by my own reaction, whether or not I'm moved by it. Honestly, I'm left mostly unmoved by Church's singing here. That's why I feel rather disappointed. It's that simple!"
1,15 Years To Go,"When I was a young girl, I use to listen to those musical talent shows like rocket To Stardom. After listening to Charlotte Church's latest CD Enchantment, I felt as if I were listening to a reprise of that show. While showing promise, Charlotte has neither the Strength, Range, Control, or Emotion, to attempt the difficult songs in this album. Had she tried something less challenging, it is possible that this CD could have risen about the demo level. As it stands now, she appears to be about 15 years aways from singing thse songs successfully. If she follows in the footsteps of a singer like Lara Fabian and gets a similar education, we may yet see her as a diva on a world stage.You've come a long way baby, but you have a long ways to go."
1,A Real Stinker,I had the opportunity to listen to this CD today at Borders listening station and was I disappointed. Of all the classical and classical crossover CDs I have listened to (in the 100s)this is absolutely the worst. This girl has no business passing herself off as a classical singer. She is nothing but a classical choir girl whose voice is as sterile as a churchmouse. This girl is sure to go the way of the Edsel.
1,This is Not Good!,"I am going to have to break with my fellow CC fan club members who are giving 5-star reviews for this album. In her first 3 albums, Charlotte has sung some great songs which are well within her range and accordingly come across very well. However in Enchantment, she ventures away from those Irish ballads, Christmas,religious and classical songs into an area of show and movie songs which require a much greater vocal range than her age allows. It is easy to spot where she is straining to reach some of the notes. It was inevitible that she would come up with a stinker sooner or later, and it has arrived in the form of Enchantment. However, I do not think this album is representative of Charlotte's ability as a singer and would encourage readers to check out some of her earlier works so as to really understand the abilities of this gifted artist."
1,A Generation To Go.,"I came over here from the Sarah Brightman pages because it said that people who bought her CD also bought this one. But after listening to this CD, I cannot understand why people would like them both. While their voices are somewhat alike, Charlotte Church does not have anywhere near the voice that Miss Brightman does. I believe that in time, she may but right now, she sounds like Miss Brightman's little daughter. I do not believe that Charlotte will be ready for any serious musical events for quite some time. At best, I see this CD as some kind of a preview of coming attractions."
1,The Charlatan,"When I first saw the songs being sung on Enchantment, I was amazed that anyone could sing all of these songs at any level of competency. After listening to them, I am now convinced that they can't. However, if they were going to let someone try, why did they ever select Charlotte Church. She has no more business trying to sing these songs than I do. For example, the lack of fluidity in her rendition of ""The Laughing Song"" would leave anyone laughing, or maybe crying, depending upon the person's expectations. The bottom line her is that Charlotte should not have taken these songs for her own. With the exception of Carrickferges, they simply do not belong in her repertoire of songs. This CD has the net effect of being a cruel hoax on the public."
2,Almost! Almost! Almost!,"I had doubted that I would ever see the songs on this CD on one album together. Naturally, I had to check out the entire album. However, even an array of classics like what is included here could not get me to buy this CD. Charlotte Church simply does not have the strength in her voice or many other requirements for that matter to sing ""Tonight"" and the others included herein. If this CD has sold as many copies as alleged, then hopefully the record label will take note and visualize what this CD could have sold with someone possessing a capably technical voice. I was Almost tempted to buy this one but it was simply too weak a cover. Give 5-stars for song selection, 4-stars for production and 0-stars for the vocals."
2,Enchanting Songs,"The songs in this CD are enchanting to be sure. However, they were meant to be sung by adults, like the originals, not a young girl. Maybe in time Charlotte will be able to do an adequeate rendering of these pieces, but at her age now, they simply sound like part of a high school play. I don't fault Charlotte here, but whomever made the song selections."
1,Is This Really Charlotte Church??,"After listening to Enchantment, it is hard to believe that this is the same Charlotte Church who sang Pie Jesu so many times on TV just a few years ago and suggested then that she was an opera or classical singer star of the future. That great powerful voice is gone and has been replaced with a muted, very average teenage-girl soprano voice. They say that nothing lasts forever, and with Charlotte's voice, it appears the end has come rather prematurely. Possibly she should have waited until her 20s before she began such a rigorous singing schedule. Even the softly sung ballads which have been included on this album can't hide the fact that Charlotte is not the phenom she once was. Only time will tell if she will ever be able to sing at that world-class level again."
1,Enchantment - Maturity is the Requirement,"This girl sounds awfully young to be singing the songs in this album. You need someone who sounds more mature than their age, not less mature. The young man, Josh Groban, who is apparently only 20 sounds much more mature for his age than Charlotte. I find myself more enchanted by his voice than hers.There must be songs for which her singing will be adequate, but these are not them. I recommend that you pass on this one."
2,Too much for one singer,"Enchantment is really a terrific compilation of songs. It would have been a lot better, however, if they had left it as an original compilation rather than having a single singer trying to do them all. Charlotte Church does O.K. on some of these, like Carrickfergus and The Little Horses. However, I think she went way out of her league when she attempted Papa Can You Hear Me and Somewhere. Some songs and some singers are just not made to be covered. Also, her duet with Josh Groban on The Prayer suggests that she is a few years away from attempting duets with dynamic singers, the caliber of Groban.Some may find this CD worth purchasing simply because of the unique song combination presented. Charlotte Church fans may also like her covers here. I don't think, however, that mainstream people into these genres will want to purchase this. Charlotte spread herself just a little too thin on this one."
2,Charlotte - Get Back On Course,"As a big Charlotte fan, I was shocked when she decided to go over to Columbia to do an album when she was doing so well with Sony. Carrickfergus sounds like the old Charlotte, but the rest of the songs have her out of place. She's not ready for those type of songs, nor is she ready to sing with Josh Groban yet. Its obvious by the record sales, that this is her weakest album to date. So, she needs to return to the music which brought her this far. There are an abundance of classical and christian songs yet to be sung and Charlotte should stay with them for the forseeable future. Things were going well there and needn't be changed."
3,Very Multifarious,"This album was not particularly well recieved. But, I must defend Charlotte by saying that though I myself study true ""opera""... I am not a ""purist"" and feel that with the modern attitude toward opera and classical music in general, broadening the horizions of (classical music) does no harm. In fact, if one stays true to the origional aria or opera, it cannot hurt to add a twist...to make it more interesting. Though on the flip side, many of the delicate and even unspoken aspects of true classical music are what makes it so fabulous. Therefore, as Charlotte incorporated all of these things, the album was perfectly acceptable.As I have said in other reviews, Charlotte is not for those who want to hear a strictly ""operatic, technically perfect"" sound. She is, however, great for sparking an interest in the wonderful world of classical music! ~Brava!"
2,Buy It Used,"I bought this album when it came out. I enjoyed it the first month because the album had a nice collection of songs, but then I found it intolerable because I couldn't ignore Charlotte's voice anymore. ""The Prayer"" really showcases how bad her voice has gotten--she can't hold low notes without losing air, and when she sings high notes, the orchestra overpowers her and her voice is lost somewhere between the wind instruments and the strings. I was quite suprised at this change because I was expecting it to be on par (or even better) than ""Voice of an Angel"".She might be a teenager, but is that a legitimate excuse for why you should be paying full price for an album that's not worth the money? ""Enchantment"" is the CD I regret buying the most. If you want to give it a try, buy it used."
5,Very nice,I admit I am a Charlotte Church groupie. She has God's gift of a clear and beautiful voice (that I wish I had.) Her efforts to develop and strengthen her voice shine in this recording. I enjoyed each song and wished the CD contained more. I am eagerly awaiting her next release and I wish her the best in her career.
5,I Didnt listen 2 the Album...,"But she gets 5 stars for being so damn fine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! She's like Lindsey Lohan without the annoying ""acting career"" to get in the way. GO CHARLOTTE!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,enchantment,"She still has the voice of an angle. A couple songs are ok, But instead of selling charlttes voice the record companies want to sell her flesh instead. My hat is off to Lulu, Charletts' voice instructor she still encourages a full range of charletts voice, and that is at least evident in this cd. I hope this is a passing phase and that charlotts handlers wake up before she ends up like Wittney Hoston and Bitinnay Spears. It is pitiful that in a few of her songs the morons doing the arrangements think there is need for electronic manipulation of this young womans beautiful voice. I'll personally be praying her career continues but I beleive she will need the spirit of Joan of Arch to do so. I'll be a little more careful when buying any future cds."
4,Very Nice,"... I like Charlotte Church, and while I doacknowledge that she still has a long way to go in her musicaldevelopment, I'm impressed by her very real talent and her courage inexploring some new types of music. There is some very impressivesinging on this CD even though some songs lack the emotional impactthey might have in the hands of a more mature singer. Overall I haveto applaud the effort that went into this recording, most of thetracks are sung quite nicely and I'm impressed by the breadth ofrepertoire that Charlotte sings here. Her singing is getting moremature and her vocal range is growing as well. In addition, I thinkher high notes are more secure and her lower-register is stronger. Myfavorite tracks are (2, 5, 6, 7 - see Amazon track list). Overall agood album."
1,Puh-lease!,"This CD stinks! Charlette thinks she can sing like Sarah Brightman--sorry, hun, but you can't. Sarah Brightman can actually sing and hit high notes without sounding like she's stressing her voice. Charlette, on the other hand, thinks she's got this powerful voice, when really all she's doing is screaming and moaning slowly. On all her CDs you can barely understand a word she's singing!..."
3,Great voice,"Charlotte Church has a magnificent voice and her range is quite impressive as she demonstrates with this album. The only tune on this album that I really cared for was ""The Prayer"". I did not really connect with any of the other songs on this album."
3,Good but not great,"Charlotte Church's voice never ceases to amaze me, but her marketing skills -- or rather, what she allows her publicity agent to do, that's another story. In this CD she's gone from the sweet and innocent 13 year old of her first release to someone who shows her sex appeal -- and her maturing body -- on the CD jacket! She's just a young teen, for heaven's sake! Some of the songs she performs also fall short, not because of her skills but because of the material. She is better than some of the songs she has recorded. I am hopeful her next release is a better match for her, but as she reaches the age where her voice settles into its adult range, I'm nto sure if she'll succeed."
5,An HONEST review!!!!!,"As a great lover for all things Broadway and loving opera/classical music, and being trained as a singer myself, I feel pretty qualified to review this...The bottom line is, this cd is excellent! Charlottes voice is still golden and takes me away, It in no way sounds ""weaker""...these were lovely songs, and Charlotte does indeed have a more mature sound. Her high notes are not to be belived, especially in The Laughing Song, and they don't sound strained at all! Charotte can do no wrong. I mus tsaym, however, that I was not too overly impressed with the cameo made by Jpsh Garnet or whatever his name was, he sounded ok but not at all the best i've ever heard! oh well. A great job done by Char!!!"
2,Could have been worse....,"I don't really want write about the whole album, there are things I liked and things I didn't. But, the thing that annoys me the most about this album is the song ""Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man."" Why have a little girl who sings ""opera"" sing a jazzy song like that? She doesn't have the vocal or emotional maturity to pull it off. With her high, head-voice singing this song just sounds silly."
4,Charlotte's Singing,I think a lot of people don't give charlotte enough credit for her talent. The fact that she was only 15 when she created this album makes no difference so I would suggest to potential buyers to not let other's doubts about her age to turn you off. She is incredibly talented and can sing difficult pieces that many people her age can't. The fact that she has been highly successful and internationally acclaimed for it already is testimony to that. And not to just young people really. Her demographic covers people mostly in the 5-12 or 30 and up range. So just because she is young does not mean she is not qualified to sing. She can and she does. Anyone with half an ear for music can tell by her music. This CD happens to be my favorite because of the song selections but any of them are pretty good as well.
1,Good Songs But Poor Singing,"I enjoyed the song selection on Enchantment, but Charlotte Church, in my opnion, was not the proper singer for such fare. He voice seemed weak and unemotional. They need an established Diva for an album like this like Lara Fabian or Sarah Brightman. Maybe in time, Charlotte may fit the bill but certainly not now."
1,Lack of Cultivation,"So she has a natural voice and sang at a young age. A natural voice is fine for church choirs, but the idea of comparing this voice to those of the world's top sopranos is ludicrous. Maybe by local choir standards her voice may be enchanting, but by standards of professional vocalists her performance is unprofessional. Her attempts at show tunes sounds like a high school version of Summer Stock. Her performance of arias from Carmen would make the writer role over in his grave. The recording of Habanera is spiritless and bland - resembling no better music than New Age Elevator schlock. If you are an old avid collector of show tunes, you might enjoy this cd. If you are looking for great music, pass this one up."
1,WHAT HAPPENED TO HER VOICE!!!!!!!,Listening to ENCHANTMENT was the first time I really listened to Charlotte Church since her Voice of an Angel Debut. And what a shock! That voice which could sing to the masses unamplified is gone. Now all we are left with is a weak teenage singer who still has problems with range and control. I guess the soothsayers were right and she did too much too fast and has just lost it. What a shame.
2,Almost Enchanted!,"I was able to obtain a copy of this CD at my local library and thus was able to give it a thorough review. At the first time through for all of these songs, I was pleasantly surprised with what I was hearing. By the time I got my second listen to each one, I began to notice shortcomings in all of them. To make sure, I was able to obtain and listen to the originals of Bali Ha'i, Tonight, and Papa Can You Hear Me Now. I concluded that Charlotte doesn't have the strength in voice or emotional expression to give these songs the character needed for repeat playing. The songs themselves are delightful and the musical accompaniment is first rate. If you have never heard this songs before, you may find this CD to your liking, but the original versions are so much better, I would recommend you hold out until they can be obtained."
1,Stupid is as stupid does...,"I visited the local music store to sample her work (will NOT purchase), and I agree completely with Music Fan from CT. Like all novelty acts, Church should stay in her homeland and perform ""tribute"" concerts covering the work of true artists. Better yet, she should go abroad to entertain the British soldiers serving as peacekeepers in Afghanistan, if they will have her. Then she should grow up."
2,Charlotte needs to mature,The only reason I gave this CD two stars is for the duet with Josh Groban (The Prayer). Most of the songs Charlotte sings all sounds alike and close to the same pitch. She is a well seasoned performer and well managed and should stick to singing and not talking. After her comments on the WTC I have found a new use for her CD's. See how far they will fly.
1,A Huge Performance Drop,"I had been a Charlotte fan for quite awhile. However after purchasing Enchantment on blind faith, I can no longer support the level to which Charlotte has fallen. As others have noted, her voice is extremely weak and no longer at a major league level. IMHO, the only genre which her voice can now support is Celtic Folk. Carrickferges is not bad. But that was the only piece on this CD worth commending. Until and unless, Charlotte is able to regain that performance level she once had, releasing albums like this is a waste of time and a disservice to those of us who expect improvement."
1,Amateur Hour,"This will be a limited review since I limited my listening of this album to those songs provided by Amazon on this site. The vocal qualities of this artist are very amateurish to say the least. I feel like I was listening to a little girl instead of a mature artist. There was neither the volume nor the range of an accomplished singer present here with Miss Church. The only song where she seemed somewhat competent on was Carrick Fergus, an Irish Ballad. Based on Miss Church's choir girl/boy voice, I believe Miss Church should stay in Church to do her singing and not make another attempt to venture into the recording studio until she matures considerably. If this is the best she can ever muster, then she should seriously consider a career change while she is still young and in school."
1,Is This The Real Charlotte??,"After having seen Charlotte on TV so many times the past 3 years, it was hard for me to believe that this was actually the same Welsh Soprano performing on this album. Either she was not in her best voice, or she has totally lost the brillance of her younger years. The voice I once heard which could sing to audiences unamplified now sounds like a beginner in a cocktail lounge. Its simply a so-so voice which works it way through some very ambitious songs with little or no emotion.I noticed some other reviewers complaining of the low ratings given this album. I had previously rated her Voice of An Angel CD with 5-stars. But this work is so far below her initial effort that anything higher than a 1-star review overstates the performance. I would hope that her next album returns to that level we all heard just a few years back. If not, she might consider taking a break from singing for awhile. Not an album to be proud of."
1,Folk Folks!,"I must concur with the others who say that Charlotte is singing the wrong genres of songs here in Enchantment. She just isn't cut out for these ""Hollywood"" type songs. I feel that she should try the folk songs like the Irish and Welsh songs she has done is previous albums. I remember when Sarah Brightman first started recording back in 1985, she did her first album of all folk songs and it sounded great. Charlotte should do the same until such time as her voice matures to where it can take on more challenging genres. Everyone is entitled to one mistake. So let Enchantment be it and get back on track with what you're good at."
2,Not Quite Enchanting,"As a Charlotte fan, I was expecting a little more out of Enchantment than I received. Charlotte doesn't demonstrate the strength and dynamics that have puncuated previous albums. Her voice seems flat most of the time and the only time I felt that I was hearing the old Charlotte was on Carrickfergus. I think she should go back to the classical music type songs where she did so well. The Broadway songs on Enchantment are just not her thing. I will be awaiting album #5 in hopes of writing a better review."
1,This is a Different Charlotte,"As a child, Charlotte Church was enchanting. However, as a young lady, she is incredibly ordinary. Whatever she had as a 12-year-old is no longer there. What we hear on this CD is no better than any 15-year-old with any singing experience could produce. Its kind of a shame that she has to continue through and finish a long contract with no more than a mediocre voice. However, Frankie Lymon went through the same experience. So, I will advise listeners to check out her first album when she really was enchanting. You will only be disappointed by spending any time with this album."
1,Forgive And Forget,"I am very dissappointed in this album by Charlotte. She ventured way outside her comparatively limited vocal range into areas for which she may never be qualified. The result was a CD full of otherwise classic show tunes which sound as if they were being sung by someone who was simply covering them as an exercise rather than having them recorded. Other than Carrickfergus, this entire CD was mediocre and pedestrian. Charlottes strength lies in her high-octave range songs like La Pastorella and Pie Jesu. To go into areas designed for a Mezzo is only inviting failure. I would strongly suggest some of Charlotte's earlier albums if you would like to hear anything worthwhile."
1,Two Out of Fifteen is Too Few,"The only songs which I found on this CD to be enjoyable at all were Carrickfergus, an Irish folk song, and The Prayer, which was a duet with Charlotte and Josh Groban, a young Baritone who has recently arrived on the U.S. scene. Unfortunately, the only part of the Prayer which I enjoyed was Groban's part. Charlotte's voice was so much weaker than Josh's that it was shocking that they would attempt to pair this duo. While many, I'm sure, will enjoy hearing Groban on this song, hearing his voice only makes Charlotte's seem so much more weak and pale by comparison. All of the other songs included here were once hits, but Charlotte's cover of them is a low quality rendition. Despite a couple of bright lights, this CD is shrouded in dullness and is not worth purchasing."
2,Barely Passing,"I disagree with those who say that Charlotte Church has ruined the songs in this album. However, she comes close. The songs themselves are classics out of Hollywood's and Broadway's past.And it would make no difference what if any volume that Charlotte no longer has in her voice. The fact is that she never possessed the range, the emotion, or the vocal control to tackle anything like what is contained in Enchantment. If you have never heard any of the songs in this album, then you may enjoy Charlotte's renditions. They would fit nicely in a High School Assembly program, but they are a far cry from what the original writers had envisioned. I would recommend this CD to those who have never heard any of the selections previously, as an introduction to what the originals may provide."
2,Not for her voice.,"Don't get me wrong, I think Charlotte Church has an OKAY voice. I'm not going to type a full scale review, but here is what I think: She sings songs that are way too high for her mezzo-soprano voice type. Take the Laughing Song for instance. This song was meant for coloratura soprano, a person with a high soprano timbre, but Charlotte was sitting there singing it in a mezzo timbre, and at the end when she came to hit the high D's, they were airy and strained! If she keeps up this trend of singing way too high for her voice, she WILL ruin it, and the only concerts she'll be giving then are concerts in the shower!"
1,OK 4 School But Not 4 Sale,"As a senior in High School here in Tucson Arizona, I have been in choir for 4 years. After listening to this CD of Charlotte Church, I can see that it would be nice to have Charlotte in our choir, but her voice is not that good so that she should be making records YET. I have made a demo of my voice so that I can try and get a scholarship to a music conservatory. After listening to Enchantment, I feel Charlotte should use that CD to try the same. If anyone buys this CD, it will be in spite of Charlotte, not because of her. Maybe someday, she will have the voice which people will find worth buying."
1,In Need Of A Rest,"After listening to parts of all of the songs on this CD, it appears that Charlotte needs a rest from singing. She has definetly lost much of her voice and sings as if she was tired of what she has been doing. There was a definet lack of emotion in all songs with the exception of Carrickfergus. However, an Irish Folk Song cannot carry this album. Lets hope that Charlotte takes a break from singing and does not end up like Mariah Carey. She needs to get away from singing for awhile and give her voice a rest."
3,"Beautiful Voice, No Expression","I really enjoyed Charlotte Church's first album, ""Voice of an Angel"". Her voice is flawless and her interpretation of the traditional repertoire is good. But this album... yikes!Charlotte's (if I may be so familiar) rendition of ""Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man"" is flat (interpretation, not pitch) and uninspiring. I don't blame her, I blame whoever picked the song. This is not a song for a 15-year old with no experience of the world to sing. Yes, it's technically perfect - but then so is a drum machine!Ditto with ""Somewhere"" from West Side Story. Feeling?! Where are you?! I won't give the CD away, but be warned if you're thinking of purchasing it."
1,Enchanted??? - I Don't Think So,"It is difficult to get enchanted, even with classic songs, when they are sung by someone who doesn't have a classic voice. In fact, the voice of Charlotte Church is downright juvenile. This album should have been sung by Lara Fabian. Then you would have been able to have heard some real singing. Some of these song writers must be rolling over in their graves."
4,same charlotte,"I'm shocked her voice hasn't improved as much as you would expect since she started singing. She stills sounds almost the same, or just a little worse, with a bit of noticeable wear on her voice. Her voice is still a little dull and lacking in depth of tone, but her voice is still tender and young so she could improve later. I love her anyway!I really admire her for all she has done at such a young age."
4,Good Introduction,"While all and sundry seem to have a problem with this CD, count me in the few that find it wonderful.This is my first Charlotte Church CD and was bought primairly because I listended to her version of ""The Prayer"" with Josh Groban and couldn't believe that two people could create another beautiful and distinct rendition of this song.Carrickfergus, The Little Horses,The Flower Duet and The Prayer are magnificent. The ""Carrickfergus"" song is simple, yet addictive to me and I still can't get it out of my head. Celtic music is so mesmerising at times.One or two of the other selections seemed to be a bit out of her emotional reach like ""Can't Help Loving dat man "" and ""If I loved you"" but she still performs them admirably .I recommend this CD to all who can appreciate talent and not just criticize a spectacular voice. Well Done"
1,Just Going Through The Motions,"Enchantment has some good songs in it, and I believe that Charlotte could have done better with her vocals, but it sounds as if she simply did one take of the song and walked off. The first take is usually a dry run just to see if everything meshes. However it is never used as the recorded version. But here it sounds as if Charlotte is just going through the motions with nothing more at stake than the dry run. This may be why so many others have commented that she seems devoid of emotion. If she is going to sing songs like the ones in Enchantment, she is going to have to get very serious about them and give the listener the impression that she really feels the songs and is conveying its meaning to them. I expected better from Charlotte and hopefully her next album will be that."
3,"good variety, poor versatility","I've always been awed by Charlotte Church's innate talent, but this CD truly disappointed me. I'm no musical expert, but I felt that her singing severely lacked heart. There was little emotion, little change in sound, despite drastic changes in song style.I was thrilled that there was such a variety of genres on this album, however, I think Miss Church demonstrated that she is not quite ready to handle all of them. I am certain that the fault is not entirely the singer's, but a great deal that of her advisors and guides.I listen through the CD a few times, but now I can't bring myself to put it back in the player."
2,Curious mix,"This album is a curious mix of music. I do find that Charlotte Church is much more pleasing to listen to than other pop Divas. I like the boy soprano quality from some of her previous works, and the traditional and Celtic folk music she performs can be quite charming. However, I feel that all works performed from Operas need to be executed with a reasonable amount of technical skill in order to show the respect that all great classical music written by master composers deserves. This recording can spark interest in classical music, but it does not do it justice."
1,Less Hollywood and More Holywood,"I had enjoyed many of Charlotte Church's renditions of some of Chistianity's favorite hymns, despite the fact that she needed a lot of improvement vocally. Unfortunately Charlotte leaves the realm where she had delighted so many and ventures into Hollywood Show type music where she is like a fish out of water. Others have noted the particulars of her shortcomings here in Enchantment so I shall not repeat. However, she has limits within which she must stay in order to be viable as a recording artist. Charlotte, take my advice and leave Hollywood until you grow up. Stay with what brought you here. Never change a winning combination."
1,Lack of Confidence,"There was something conspicuously absent from this CD which was present in many of the original versions of the songs sung here. To me, its best described as confidence which manifests itself as emotion in these very sensitive and delicate songs. Charlotte seems to be singing as if she is scared of something. Possibly she knew that she was quite a few years away from the age when she would have the mature vocal qualities necessary to do justice to these songs which rate among some of the best ever to be sung on screen and stage. This could be a preview of coming attractions some years down the road or, as one reviewer put it, just a Novelty Act."
1,Kid Stuff,"After listening to what was provided of this CD by Amazon, I had a difficult time determining which rating to give it. If you were to compare it to todays divas, it is certainly only 1-star stuff. If you would go up against many of the unsigned singers roaming around local clubs, it might be a 3-star rating and if you were to compare it to school-girl performances, you might want to give Charlotte 5-stars. However since Amazon is asking you to pay the same price as if you were getting the CD of a diva, then it is that comparison which must guide my ratings. There are certain vocal elements which almost always come with age. There are exceptions suchs as Judy Garland, but Charlotte does not fall into that category. Possibly in 10 years, you may want to revisit some of Charlotte's music if she is still singing. However, Right now, this is still kid stuff."
1,Too Little - Too Late,"After listening to this entire album, it seemed to me that the producers were trying to find something that would please everyone. They tried Hollywood, and Broadway, and even Ireland. However, it wasn't until the albums final cut, ""The Prayer"" when they got my ear. Unfortunately, it wasn't the CDs featured singer, Charlotte Church that did it, but Josh Groban, a personality from the Ally McBeal Show. Groban has a voice which should be world renown within this year. Unfortunately, his voice is so good that it makes Charlotte's voice pale by comparison. And possibly Charlotte's voice really is the problem here. In any case, a single Groban cut was not enough to entice me to buy this album, but I will certainly give his CD a good listen. One song does not an album make."
1,No Longer Remarkable,"I'm sure other have said this same thing, but after listening to Charlotte's lastest album, Enchantment, she is no longer that remarkable 12-year-old, but just another 15-year-old who sings. Her efforts on this album are O.K., but nothing more than probably hundreds of girls her age could have accomplished. As many have pointed out, her duet with Josh Groban demonstrates just how normal her voice is as Groban exhibits what is an exceptional voice. In fact, its difficult to even call ""The Prayer"" a duet. If Charlotte means to go on singing, she needs to find good original material for which a voice like hers will suffice. Her voice is no longer able to carry an album by itself."
1,Charlotte - Avoid Pop,"There has been a buzz around town that Charlotte Church was breaking out of her Angel image and was ready to follow in the footsteps of her stable-mate Christina Aguilara. Well, if Enchantment is any example of her pop potential, she needs to reconsider that type of a move. She needs to have more volume and energy that what is demonstrated in this CD. The energy which she once demonstrated in her early work is conspicuously missing and all we hear are some breathy renditions of some songs from the movies. Its not surprising she has received so many negative reviews. They are well deserved. Unless someone can create some new type of pop for her, she needs to retreat back from where she came until she can generate the strength to give us more than just some Enchantment."
1,The Law of Supply and Demand,"After listening to Charlotte Church's Album, Enchantment, I began to wonder why anyone would pay money to listen to such inferior singing. And then the answer came to me. There simply isn't anything else out there like this, so the people have no choice if they want to listen to these types of songs freshly sung. Its the good ol law of supply and demand. The record companies, thus determine what we are given to listen to. I will recommend this album only to those desparate and starving for the type of songs in Enchantment."
1,A victim of Puberty???,"I'm not sure what happened to Charlotte from the time she was 12 until now, but she is not the same singer she once was. Maybe she was only good for a few years of ""opera-type"" singing. Whatever the reason, Enchantment provides the listener with nothing novel; merely weak renditions of some well-known show tunes. Fortunately there are tapes and CDs from her earlier years where she was worth listening to."
1,A Lost Soul,"I have read some of the other recent reviews which indicate that Miss Church has not lost her voice. However, a review of the selections from Enchantment along with that recent article in GQ Magazine serve to belie that disclaimer. The fears of many that she would lose her voice if she continued to abuse it have obviously come true. That volume she once had where she could sing, without the benefit of amplication, to the multitudes have gone. Its not that her pale soprano voice is bad, its just that it cannot be distinguished from 1000 other girls her age here in my home state of Texas. She will have to be far more selective in her song selection in the future and not attempt to venture in territory reserved for those Divas, which at one time we thought would include her. The songs of Enchantment were not meant to be sung by a choir girl. And accordingly, the result is something far short of what the writers of these timeless pieces had envisioned.Samantha"
1,"Lovely tone, but there's nothing upstairs","Church has a lovely voice and might eventually develop into a good singer. Currently, she sings everything as if she were singing phonetically in a language she does not understand. Her phrasing is nonexistent. Her voice is soulless and dull. (...) I have a hard time believing any American music lover would waste their money on this talented but shallow child. Audra McDonald's ""How Glory Goes"" shows what an actual singer can do with this sort of material. Buy it instead."
1,Out of Place,"I have only heard Charlotte Church a few times on TV before listening to this CD. However it is obvious she is out of place with this type of music. I must agree with the other reviews which suggest she stay with Xmas Carols and the like. She has a choir girls voice which cannot possibly sing Show Songs like they have in this album. Hopefully, these reviews will help her return to what she does best for her next album. She is totally Out of Place in this one."
1,Enchanting Songs - Impuissant Singing,"There are some beautiful songs in this album, but the vocalist selected simply doesn't have what it takes to sing them. Other than Carrick Fergus, an Irish Folk Song, I simply couldn't get into any of these songs with Miss Church's singing. Its a shame because you don't often see an array of songs like these out of Show Business's finest hours. Hopefully time will cure Miss Church's singing ills. But for now she should look towards the Irish Folk music where she seems to be confortable and her weak voice are not such a burden."
1,A Losing Battle,"I was drawn over here from the Kathleen Battle pages, and had hoped to hear one of musicdoms newest prodigies strut through her paces. However, what I heard was someone who apparently has remained in stasis since she came on the scene 3 or 4 years ago. It simply sounded like a child attempting to sing adult songs. For a small child, it was O.K., but on an adult scale, it was not satisfactory. Possibly Charlotte can be 12 forever, but if she is trying to reach an adult level of competency, she is losing the battle. Not up to traditional standards."
2,A disappointment,"I have Charlotte's three other CDs, and I enjoy her work.But this is NOT her best effort. It has its moments, like Carrickfergus, a Celtic song which seems to fit Charlotte's talents well. But in general, it seems these are the songs that Sony wants Charlotte to sing, not those she would choose herself. And it shows ... her heart doesn't seem to be in them, as it was on the earlier CDs. My advice is, if you want to hear Charlotte at her best, get her Christmas CD (Dream a Dream) from last year. Skip this one. (...)"
4,Wonderful Singer.... but limited to operatic style!,"Charlotte is phenomenal! I've followed her work for years. She has a voice that is VERY easy on ones ears. However, she does not possess the talent to have different styles of voicing. She's singing Broadway songs in a very profound operatic voice. She BEST singers like Streisand, Eder, Peters, Salgona, etc sing these songs in a much more becoming style. All in all, though, this is a GREAT CD. ...don't expect the songs to be the best renditions, though."
2,Extremely disappointing,"Definitely not one of Ms Church's better works. The choice of songs is uninspired, pitching her thin adolescent voice against some of the best who have done the same songs before (Tonight, Secret Garden's A Bit of Earth, The Prayer, Yentl's Papa Can you hear me) and coming out very disappointingly.If you haven't bought the album yet, don't!There wasn't one song on the album that I liked - and this is from someone who religiously bought her previous albums and DVDs"
1,Enchanting? - In Part,"The songs in ""Enchantment"" are certainly so, however, the singing does not remind me of the originals. Charlotte needs to stay with songs more in line with her voice. She should stay away from Hollywood and closer to Ireland."
1,Change Course - Please!!!,"There is an old saying that ""If It Works, Don't Try To Fix It"". Unfortunately, Charlotte strayed from what worked for her with her first 3 CDs and tried songs really not suited to her in Enchantment. She needs to either go back to those successful light classical/traditional folk/religious songs she has been doing or go to some Joni Mitchell type pop. The Enchantment songs are just not her thing."
3,Descent Option for Tie Control,Product works as expected. It arrived without some pieces. I contacted customer support and the replacements were delivered ASAP.
3,Tie rack,The idea is good but the product is a little shaky. The rack is not real secure on the closet rod. Even tightened all the way down it still has the ability to move and tip. It operates fairly well but I have to keep leveling it out because it tips so much.
3,Borrow or Rent it if you can,"To be honest I bought this movie because I am a fan of the band TOOL and their lead singer (Maynard James Keenan) has a small part in the movie. I am also a fan of Rage Against the Machine the band in which the lead actor (Brad Wilkes) is the drummer. Ed Asner did a very good job as well as Keenan, but I found Wilkes acting to be a little sub par. It was an interesting movie to see, but if you just want to see a short film I would recommend trying to find someone that has it."
3,WEIRD WHODUNIT,"Coming from the usually graphically violent Asylum Films house, RED RIGHT HAND is more of a murder mystery with supernatural overtones. A group of friends reunite for their fifteenth reunion, and we gather from their apprehension, all isn't well. Seems like on the night of their graduation, one of their friends died under mysterious circumstances and the friends tried to cover the death up. Some of the sexual dialogue borders on being laughable but the performances from group of unknown actors are strong and the movie has a forboding sense of impending doom with a rather predictable dark ending. A faster pace may have helped build better suspense, but it's much better than most of the films from this studio's catalogue."
5,"A creepy, dark supernatural suspense","A high school reunion reveals a dark secret of a select cadre of attendees: That they have bloodied their hands with the corpse of a fellow student buried in the town. An interlocking web and past and present sexual relationships contributes another layer of sinisterness and amorlity to the story, which takes on a supernatural dimension as it progresses.A superbly acted, sharply filmed psychological study of ordinary people confronted with encounters of the murkiest kind."
2,Stupid movie,"I read the other reviews and thought to myself ""How bad could it be?"" Well it is pretty stupid. Please do not waste your money on this."
3,Interesting Book,"Like wat the editorial review says, the front portion of the book covers several techniques of knitting, the basics like increases, decreases, yarn overs, color knitting (fair isle, slip stitch), short row etc. There are samples given to illustrate the techniques and basic instructions as well.There are several projects at the back that covers knitting garments in unusual and challenging ways like top down, side to side etc. It has pullovers, vests, bedjackets, pillows and hats. But just a few projects are given. Have not tried them yet, so not sure if there are any mistakes.The book is pretty expensive to buy and if you are a frequent buyer of knitting magazines, you would have read similar articles relating to knitting techniques before.If you are an experienced knitting, then don't think you will need the book, rather borrow a copy from friends or the library to try the projects."
2,sucks,"I have to say when I bought it I thought there would be more, michelle m. pillow is an amazing erotic book author, but even the best have a bad day and unfortunately for her this was a very bad day indeed, the book was stupid, silly and a great disapointment. I sold it the next day if that tells you anything about the book."
2,For the locals only,"The problem with this book, and most of the others in this series, is that there is no overarching narrative to hold it together. When was Livingston founded? What prompted its growth? What differentiates it from the surrounding towns? So much of this information is left out. You don't even find out which of the famous colonial Livingstons the place was named after until 2/3rds the way through the book! The second-half of the 20th century section looks like a combination of people's photo albums. Why photos of the police chief or head librarian? I'm not saying they weren't important people but why are they spotligthed over others?Having said all that, there are some photos that illustrate the historic elements--the few existing--that make one realize how far back the place goes. One can seek out those structures that have endured time. But even then, there is no context to put them in. I suspect that residents of the place might find the book interesting, but not many others."
5,Excellent Selection of Stories,"I stumbled across this book years ago in a Border's remainder bin, and on a whim decided to see what other people thought of it. I was surprised to see that not even one person had reviewed it yet! Overall, this book is a strong collection of short stories, each one containing completely believable, if not always sympathetic characters. If you have read and liked The Mermaid's Singing, you'll probably like this one, since it shares a lot of similar themes, though Mary Morrissy's writing is stronger."
5,Powerful yet simple,"Good all around drill~Light with plenty of power to drive 3"" screws~rear bubble level is a nice touch~unquestionable Dewalt quality!"
5,Excellent Drill,"I have owned this drill for 3 years now and it is very powerful for a 3/8"" drill. I use it alot and have never had any problems. Only wish that I would have gotten the keyless model."
5,A Film That Will Change Your Life!,I initially did not have high expectations for this low budget film but was amazed at the life lessons that were taught in such a way to relate to nearly every viewer. The acting was solid and it truly gives hope and meaning to a person who is struggling to figure out what this life is all about...This movie is a MUST see for all families (there is one violent scene that may not be appropriate for young viewers). I laughed and I cried! Five Stars!!!!!
4,A good book,I like this book but the only part I didn't like was when Sarah and her father were in the cave. My favorite part was when Sarah was left alone and the Indians came. You should read this book.
3,Sarah Noble,I liked this book because it tought me about Indian life.I would recommend this book to a friend because it is a true story.
4,The Courage of Sarah Noble,Sarah Noble was only eight years old.She said she could cook.Herfather said bravery and afraidness were the best courage of all.
3,The Courage of Sarah Noble,I did not really like this book because it did not have many exciting parts.The parts are not exciting because there was no surprises.
3,The courage of Sarah Noble,"Our class read The Courage of Sarah Noble. I liked this story for several reasons. First I liked the part when the Indian childen played with me. Then, I like Tall John and his family. I also like when I read a book to the Indian children. I learned some interesting facts. First, I learned that Indian children can play with other children. Also I learned that Tall John knows how to speak a little English. I liked this interesting book."
2,Sarah Noble,"Our class read The Courage of Sarah Noble. I liked this book for many reasons. I liked it when Sarah taught the Indian children how to speak English and the Indian children taught Sarah how to play Indian games. I also liked when Sarah stays with the Indian children while her dad goes to get the rest of the family. Last, I liked when the rest of Sarah's family lives with her at the end. I learned some interesting facts. I learned that the Indian children play different games than the English. I also learned that some Indians live in homes called wigwoms. Finally, I learned that Indians are not mean to the English. The Courage of Sarah Noble is an interesting book."
1,The Courage of Sarah Noble,I disliked the Courage of Sara Noble because there was notvery much action and excitment. I don't think Sara wasvery courageous because she had to sleep with a cloke every night.I would not recommend this book to my friends because I don't think they would like it that much.Charlie
1,A Review Of Sarah Noble,"I didn't really like this story but I still recommend this book because it has a lot of twists and turns and is pretty exciting. If you like Indians, history, or Connecticut You're going to like this book."
1,Parents and Educators: AVOID this book!!!!!,"The author's condescending, simplistic attitude towards American Indians is exactly what we do NOT want to pass on to our children. If you must teach this book, at least have your students think hard about how American Indians are portrayed in it. No doubt it was considered a masterwork of tolerance in its day (1954). Thank goodness times have changed since then, although the fact that this book is currently being taught in schools shows that there is still quite a way to go!"
4,Sarah Noble,I liked this book because it was very interesting. I learned that it was very hard living back then. They had to build everything.I think other people would like this book.
4,Cute,"I thought this book was cute, but could be boring. Also if you had a 3rd grade teacher who over did this book, you wouldn't care for it that much. It was about Sarah Noble, who went with her Father out in the wilderness and has to stay with the Indians."
2,The Courage of Sarah Noble,The courage of sarah noble was a good book.The part I liked about was when sarah heard rustling in the trees and it was a skunk. The part I didn't like about it is when sarah always talks about her doll because I am a boy and boys don't like dolls.I would not be afraid on the journey so I would not go because I would not want to be hungry and thirsty a lot.
3,The Courage of Sarah Noble,Our class read The Courage of Sarah Noble. I liked this story for many reasons. I liked it when Sarah and her dad went on the journey to the land were they would build their settlement. When they finally got to the land they had to build their house. While Sarah's dad built the house Sarah made friends with Indians. I learned some interesting facts. I learned that the Indans ate with their hands. The Indians lived in wigwams. The Courage of Sarah Noble is a great book.
5,The Courage of Sarah Noble,I am a third grade student. My class just finished reading the book. I liked this book because it taught me not be afraid of the woods.This book taught me to not always be afraid of strangers because they might be a nice person.This book taught me that people that you hardly know might still protect you from bad things.I recomend this book to a friend because he is afraid of strangers.It would teach him to be less afraid and face his fear.Chase
2,THE COURAGE OF SARAH NOBLE,I disliked the book because I dont like the olden days.I would not recommend this book to a friend because her fatherleft her with the Indians.
5,the courage of sarah Noble,I really liked this book because The courage of Sarah Noble sets a good example of a good way to meet frends and travel in a lot of different ways and not be scared of things. I would recamend this book to a friend because it's almost the best in the world. I liked the action and events.
2,Courage of Sarah Noble,I disliked this book because it did not have alot of action. I would not recommend this book because it did not have alot of technology.Dylan
3,8 kids write a review about The Courage of Sarah Noble,"We liked this book because it is historical fiction and we are learning about Native Americans in our History classes. It was full of many adventures about how pioneers and Indians lived long ago. Sarah Noble was a real girl who lived in New Milford, Connecticut. We would recommend this book to others who like an easy to read book that is not too long. We would also recommend this book to someone who likes history. This book ended happily and was a great story."
3,Be on the lookout for stereotypes,"I liked this book because it was full of adventure. There were a lot of stereotypes in it, though. The author made it sound like the Native Americans are stupid, Native Americans are poor and not as well dressed as Sarah is, and it talks about Sarah as a much more beautiful person than the Native Americans.The illustrations are not so good either. The illustrator made the Native Americans look like big fat babies and they were bare naked! The book was written with stereotypes because at that time people weren't aware that the things that were written about the ""Indians"" were not actually true. Alice Dagliesh wrote the book in 1954, so the book is not how it would be written today.I recommend this book but since it was written a long time ago, people who read it should be on the lookout for stereotypes.A third grader at the Gordon School"
5,Sarah Noble Book Review,"Our class read The Courage of Sarah Noble. I liked this story for several reasons. First, It was interesting. Next, it was cool. Third, it was exciting. I learned some interesting facts. I learned that some indians don't have any plates and silverware so that means that some indians are poor. The Courage of Sarah Noble is an interesting book."
5,My favorite book,I liked Sarah Noble because she was brave. I would recommend this book to a friend because she was kind to the Indians. It is a very good book for 2nd graders.
1,Silly and Outdated,"This book reflects a 1950s approach to images of Native Americans, who apparently had little cultural sophistication except for rudimentary skills like weaving baskets. They also got a kick out of carrying little white girls on their shoulders through the forest. ""Tall John"" is one ""Indian's"" name. How funny is that??!! Sarah is a hero for ""teaching"" the Indians. How nice!! One can list about 50 stereotypes in this silly book. ... One can only chuckle (or get angry) to see that this book is actually being used in elementary classrooms today. If you buy it, be prepared to fall off your chair from laughing so hard."
5,sarah's journey,What I like best about the story is when her family came back. And I liked it when she was reading a book and the Indian kids came and listened to the story.The thing I don't like is when her dad was building the house; they lived in a cave!I think other people would like this book because it has interesting parts like when she made friends.
5,The Courage of Sarah Noble,I like this book because the character Sarah kept up her courage. I would recommend this book because it teaches people how to be brave.
3,The Courage of Sarah Noble,"I do not like Sarah's story. Well, I like the adventure of meeting the Indains. I don't want to spoil the story though."
3,An Old Newbery Honor Book,"Sarah and her father travel together to build a new home for their family in early 18th century America. The house is built and it is time for Sarah's father to collect the rest of the family and bring them to their new home. Sarah must remain near the new home, with a Native American family. It is a good experience for Sarah as she comes to care for the family almost as much as her own, as she sees the commonalities of the Native American family with her own. There is a general feeling of condescension, but that has to be placed in the context of the time in which this book was written. In addition, the experience of discovering the ways the families are alike makes the book worthy of reading despite the book's flaws. Newbery Honor."
2,Its not the best book,I think this book is not so good because it doesn't really have a good point to it. Remember it is your choice not mine. If you want to pick it you can. This book is also not so good because it doesn't really have exciting parts.
2,A Not So Good Book,"I did not like this book a lot because it didn't catch my interest. It wasn't that great,and I found it boring, especially in the end. I think it would have been better if it had a little action and mystery. It was a not so good book."
4,The Courage Of Sarah Noble,I would recommend this book to a friend because I liked that it was a true story. Sarah Noble was a true girl eight year old girl who had to be brave when she was helping her dad build a house in the wilderness.The book also talks about other people. It gets exciting when you read and find a new character. I liked the character Tall John who is an Indian who helped Sarah and her father.
3,Franky Reluzco's Review,"I like this book because it gave so much detail in the pictures and the writing. It also tells you how colonial people moved, lived, hunted, ate, and I like learning about colonial times. One thing I learned was how things in the 1700's were for childeren, Indians, and adults. I learned what Indians and colonial people eat and how they eat! I like how the author made very detailed writing. She made the story come alive by putting the important pictures only or the pictures she wrote about."
5,Are u ready for bed?,"once there was a rabbit named miss rabbit here how it gose. once miss rabbit sighed when all of her children were tucked safely into bed. ahh peace and quiet at last she said. mrs. rabbit tried a gentle lullaby hush a bye bunny on the tree top when the bough breaks the cradle... bunnys eyes began to close.is my bunny sleepy now? whisplerd mrs rabbit so as not to wake the others No! said little bunny im not sleepy at all. he wanted to stay up all night long with his mommy.

5,The Courage of Sarah Noble,I am a third grad student. We just finished this book. I like this book because Sarh gave love to her family. I wouled recommend this book to a frend because Sarah loves her family so much.River
4,The Courage of Sarah Noble,My fourth grade class really enjoyed reading this book. It kept the atttention and interest of both the boys and girls.
3,Finding Courage,"I liked Courage of Sarah Noble because it showed how much courage Sarah had in her and it shows what life was life back on those days. I did not like this book because Sarah was mean to the Indians at first. It gets better after that part of the book, though. I also did not like the way Sarah's mother said the Indians were savages. Besides that it is a good book. I think you should read it."
3,A Good Book That Is A True Story,"The Courage of Sarah Noble is a good book. It is historical fiction. That means that some of it really happened a long time ago. It's about an eight year old girl who went into the wilderness with her father to build a house for her family. The trip was only 26 miles. It was scary, though. When the house was done Sarah's dad left her with some Indians while he wemt to get the rest of the family. Sarah had to keep up her courage even though it was really scary for her. I think this was a great book."
3,Courage of Sarah Noble is a good book for kids,This book is about Sarah and her father taking a rough journey. I liked the book because it was action packed. My favorite part was when Sarah made friends with the Indian children. I thought the plot and the setting were clever and good. The main message was to keep up your courage and be brave. I think other kids should read this book because it teaches you to be brave. (8)
4,Keeping Up Your Courage,The book is about an eight year old girl who is the main character. I liked the story because the story was very interesting and all the characters were good. My favorite part was when all of the Indian children crowded around Sarah when she was reading. My favorite characters were all of them because they were all good. I think the main message was that you should keep up your courage when you are scared. I would recommend this book for children because it is very interesting. (7)
3,an o.k book,The courage of Sarah Noble was an o.k book.I liked this bookbecause it had a good plot.I would not recommend this book to a friend because it is to long!If I had to pick my favorite book this would not quite be it.
3,What seems to be wrong?...A LOT,This story is about a pioneer girl who goes to New Millford with her Dad.The things that are wrong are :1.They call the Indians savages.2.They do not tell the name of the tribe.
2,a student,I think this book could be better. It's a book that has no real life troable. Nothing goes wrong. It's just not a book for me!
1,An ok book,"The book was bad. If you want to read it, read it. I wish it was more exciting. I do not like adventures."
3,A GOOD BOOK,I would rate this book 3 stars because I am not really into the olden time. You would like this books about the olded times . I would recommend this book to my brother and my three sisters because I think they would like it.
4,this book is good,I would recommend this book to my family and friends because they might like the Indians and Sarah.They would also like the book because they like early settlers.I also liked this book because it taught me a lot of stuff about early settlers.
4,Interesting story!,"I had never heard of this book until my 1st grader was reading it for a school book club. The book is rather short, easy to read, and tells a nice story about a time in American history that my son didn't know much about. The story was simple and easy to follow and he really liked that it was based on a true story. It made it seem more real. There's not a lot of story resolution or much in the way of character development, but it's a nice historic novel."
2,the courage of Sarah Noble,The book: The Courage Of Sarah Noble was a great story. It teaches you to keep up your courage even if you are alone with someone you just met a few days ago. I would recommend this book to my friend Daniela because I think she would relate!
1,The Courage of Sarah Noble,The Courage of Sarah Noble is mainly about Sarah keeping up her courage. I didn't like the book because it didn't tell about her family that much. My least favorite part was when John Noble took Sarah away from Tall John because Tall John was sad to have to let her go. That's my opinion of the book. (5)
3,"Great book, but don't believe everything you read","The Courage of Sarah Noble is a wonderful book because there are many twists and turns throughout the story, and it shows you what friendship means.This book also has many examples of stereotypical thinking. Back in 1954 they were not so sensitive to how the book might look to a Native American. Also the author and the illustrator did do a very good job researching but they did not take the time to look and listen to a Native American.Once the author mentioned that ""Sarah realized with a shock that they were not wearing clothes, unless you could call that small piece of cloth 'clothing.'"" Alice also said ""the children came in, creeping nearer, like small brown field mice..."" I think these descriptions are demeaning to Native people.This book is easy to visualize. It would be a great book to learn from but don't believe everything you read."
5,The Courage of Sarah Noble,This is about a young girl who moves to the wilderness with father to build a family home. As they travel through the forest they see and hear wolves and other wild animals. After the house is finished her father leaves her with the indians while he returns for the rest of the family. It must have been very scarey for her. She is only eight years old. Our teacher Mrs. Anton teaches us the words we don't know. I like adventures and this is a great adventure story. I know everyone would like this book.I think my sister Taylor would like it too.
3,"Well written, unintentionally mean","The Courage of Sarah Noble is well written. Sarah is helpful, caring, reliable and, of course, courageous. Sarah's main quote, ""Keep up your courage, Sarah Noble,"" is used throughout the book.This book is also fairly stereotypical. The Native Americans look bad, making them look dumb. There is also unintentionally mean thinking about the Native Americans within the book. The book has a highly descriptive background.Sarah is illustrated with hard work, making her look better than the Native Americans, making her look superior.In the time the book was written, the government was not very sensitive to stereotypes, and did not know much about Native Americans. So I personally think you cannot blame the author."
4,I really liked this book,I liked this book because it's about Indians and Americans getting to know each other more. It's about a girl and her father that go on a journey to find a home in the wilderness. And it's a true story.
4,To Be Polite,"I liked this book because Sarah was nice to the Indians and she was polite. I'd recommend this book because it's interesting, exciting, and fun to read."
4,Judging Others,"I liked this book because Sarah is friendly and she knows what is right and what is wrong. I recommend this book because it teaches us to keep up your courage, not to judge others by their outsides, but to judge them by their personality."
4,The Courage of Sarah Noble,I thought the book was really cool. when Sarah lived with the indians. When Sarah lived with the indians she was brave.She played cool games
4,Sarah Noble the Brave,I think most childen will like this book Sarah Noble. It thought the book was good because there was a lot of travoling and I like travelling and I like traveling stories. My favorite character is Sarah and Sarah's mom and dad and brothers and sisters.
1,The Courge Of Sarah Noble,I didn't like the story becuase their was no action. But if you like stories with no action this would be a good book for you.
3,The Courage That Sarah Had,"I think it is an ok book.I would recommend it. The book was about a girl who goes to Conecticut with her dad to build a house. They meet Indians. Later Sarah's dad goes back to Sarah's family. Sarah has to stay with the Indians. Sarah's dad came back later,Sarah saw her family again and they lived in the new house."
4,"Brave, Sarah Noble","This story was pretty good because some parts were really sad, some parts I really liked. My favorite part was when Sarah saw her family again. That was good. I don't know you might like this story. I might recomend this story to a second grader or a first grader. If you like Conneticut or Massachusettes you might like this book or if you like Indians you might like this book. Sarah has to keep up her courage to make it through this story!!!"
4,The Courage of Sarah Noble,I like this book because it is a good book to read and write about. I like the size of print and drawings that the author did. I would recommend this book to a friend because they can learn how Indians lived and the pioneers.
2,The Courage of Sarah Noble,"I disliked this book because it was not exciting enough.But,I did like how real author wrote how the skunk smelled and Sarah reacted to it.I would recommend this book to a friend to see if they likeit or not just for their opinion.But"
5,The Courage Of Sarah Noble,"I like the book because at first she missed her mother, then at the end , she was happy to see her mother. I would recommend this book to a friend because this book is a journey book and I like journey books."
4,The Courag Of Sarah Noble,"Our class read The Courage Of Sarah Noble. I liked this bok because this book has good storyline. I also like this book because they met the indians and they became friends. The last thing l like about this book is that there is lots of parts that are scary, sad, and nice.I learned some interesting facts. l learned that the indians helped the people build homes. l also learned that some indians are enemies to other indians. The final thing l learned is that they made clothes out of different skins like deer skins. The Courage Of Sarah Noble is a great book!"
5,The Great Review of Sarah Noble,I would recommend this book because it's been really adventurous. It was adventurous because it was exciting and she takes on a big responsibility. I felt like the book was very interesting.
2,Sarah Noble,I disliked this book because it was not that interesting to me. I did like how the Indians were so nice to Sarah and her family though. I would not recommend this book to a friend because it does not have alot of adventure and excitment.
3,A good book,The novel Sarah Noble was full of good facts. It was cool when the father was going to shoot the deer. I liked when Tall John was carrying Sarah on his back.
3,A Super Book,I like this book because it is full of adventure. My favorite part iswhen Sarah first met the Indians.
2,Pick another book,I didn't like it. The book was very dull. It wasn't good and adventurous. It wasn't fun to listen to.
1,It's OK,I didn't really like this book because it didn't have many good and exciting parts in it. It had no good pictures either. If you want to read this book you can but I didn't like it at all.
2,Sarah Noble Review,I liked this book because I learned a lot about the 1800's. I would recommend this book to someone else because it is interesting.
5,The Courage Of Sarah Noble,The Courage Of Sarah Noble is a great book! You should read itbecause it's exiting and adventureous. My favorite part was whenSarah stayed with the indians.
3,The Indians,I liked this story because it had a lot of opinions about the Indians. Some characters said things that were not true like Indians were savages but they are just like us. Just because they do things different does not make them savages. I would recommend this book to friend because they can learn a lot from some of the characters in the story.
4,The Courage of Sarah Noble,I am in second grade. Our class just read The Courage of Sarah Noble. The only reason I didn't like this book was because I wished it had been about a boy. Actually I really liked it. I liked it because it really was about a true story. Everybody should read it as a class. David
4,"Excellent Book, just had a dumb ending.","Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys. Real good book, could've used some Nancy/Frank romance. (I'm sorry for those of you addicted to Ned Nickerson, I just think Nancy and Frank should go together.) Didn't like the ending. It also took them too long to realize who was and WASN'T doing illegal things. I figured part of it out before they did!"
4,Pretty good book not one of Keene's best,Nancy Drew and George Fayne are staying at the university in Utah with their friend Alison Fernley.Things go wrong when her boyfriend goes missing. Frank and Joe Hardy are working undercover at the site for the 2002 winter olympics.The Hardy's and Nancy team up and catch the bad guys after many setbacks. To find out more read the book
4,Great Book!,"I have to give this book a 4. But i wish it had a little more 'Romance' between Nancy and Frank. Other than that, Great Book!! All who read this book should also read ""The Last Resort"" That's a good one. So are The Hardy Boys Casefiles and Nancy Drew Files. Check em' out!"
5,Proud to be Canadian!!!,This man is a lyrical madman. His rhymes are so down-to-earth that you feel like you know him. Great live performances under his belt as well. Comes from the maritimes in Canada and rates with most all of the underground hip-hop sensations from the U.S.of A. Takes hip-hop to a new level. Keep it up homie.Much love and respect... PEACE OUT!
2,Great Read for Auburn Lovers,"If you love Auburn, particularly Auburn Football, this book is for you. Rob gives you the positive inside view of a great tradition as told by a young man with great talent. Once I started reading I could not put it down. This book is a great read for Auburn Lovers."
3,The first All-Starr Band,"When Ringo decided to get together with a few friends and tour; it was time to party. Just looking to have a good time, Ringo is represented by 5 of his songs and he opens and closes the CD, but all the artists make contributions. From Dr. John doing ""Iko Iko"" (again!) and a hard rocking ""Life in the Fast Lane"" with Joe Walsh going crazy, the collaborations are loose but there is a definite sense of fun here. Even little known songs, like Nils Lofgren's ""Shine Silently,"" and Rick Danko's take on Buddy Holly, (""Raining in My Heart"") are treated with equal energy. A good keepsake from a fun show, but that is really all it represents."
3,"A pretty screwy live disc, but passably entertaining","I'm not sure this live disc really deserves 3 stars, probably more like 2 or 2 1/2. I guess I just feel generous because I bought this album the day it was released back in 1990 and I still occasionally listen to it. But really, its really only of interest to Beatles' completists-- of which there are many. The reason I say its a screwy disc is because of the 12 cuts, less than half are sung by the main attraction: Ringo. Nobody is buying this for Nils Lofgren's ""Shine Silently"", if you know what I mean. They're buying it for Ringo, and out of the five songs he sings, not one of them is a Beatles' tune. Yes, a couple were recorded with the Beatles, but his biggies aren't here. Save your money for the all-Ringo VH-1 Storytellers."
1,Horrible text for introductory differential equations,"The book is filled with abstract theory little of which makes sense to an ODE introductory student. The examples given in the book are rarely similar to the ones found in the problem set. I am currently taking ODE and I feel like I spend more time learning from the internet than from the book. The author takes the simplest topic and makes it sound like neuroscience. If you can avoid buying this book, then do so at all costs. If not, just get the old version for a low price( for the problem sets) and try learning the material from youtube and google."
2,very useless book,As far as text books go this book is just awful. limited examples and very poor explanations. not that it really matters though because i doubt anybody would pay a $100 for this just to read it. It is a required textbook for a college class so ya dont really get a choice
3,"Not so elementary, my dear Watson","While the book certainly covers all the material one needs to gain a basic understanding of differential equations, it does not present the information in a particularly clear manner. The writing style does not help to break down the complexity of the subject, and in some cases the notation is a little strange. I have had to read several sections two or three times to grasp the material, even after attending class for the week. My teacher's accent and handwriting don't help matters, so it would be nice if this book were more accessible. I am giving the book three stars because, as frustrating as it can be, overly complex language in math texts seems to be the standard."
4,Very Good Differential Equations Book,I was a teaching assistant in a class that used this book. I liked the book a lot because it had very clear exposition. The methods to solve differential equations were clearly delineated and the exercises in the book served the class well.I thought this book was very good. I particularly like how each chapter had a summary of the results. The summary helped me find the technique I was looking for faster and get a good appreciation of what was going on.
3,As ordered,"Bought it for a course, we went through most of the book in a semester, it is worth noting that the chapter on oscillations (ones with and without forcing functions) is very dense and assumes background knowledge. Otherwise, fine."
2,Bleh,"This book sucks, but on the bright side the back of the book has the answer to every problem, instead of just the odd ones. Plus, I managed to make a profit by buying the book on Amazon, then selling it to my school for $60 at the end of the semester."
1,Terrible Introductory Text Book,"This book is a terrible reference for learning students new to differential equations. The readings are very complex and are certainly not written on a level suitable for newcomers. The problems at the end of each section often do not have examples, so one is forced to figure out the solution from scratch. No key concepts are emphasized; walls of text must be deciphered to identify vital components of the lesson. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I have never truly hated a math textbook until now."
4,RCA TV,"Overall good TV. Guide Plus is a neat feature for regular cable, but not with satellite. Also, PIP feature basically useless with satellite. One of the video inputs hasn't worked correctly since I got it. One other little problem: When viewing tapes on the VCR, there's always a little fuzz at the top of the picture. Originally I thought it was the VCR, but I have hooked up several different VCRs and they all do the same thing, whereas when the same VCRs are hooked up to another TV, that problem doesn't happen. Has something to do with the coaxial hook-up. As far as the picture goes, it's great. Super TV for the price."
3,It's Brazilian. What else can I say?,"Those of you familiar with Brazilian death metal know the drill. Blast beats galore, crazy technical guitars, barking vocals about blasphemy, the Apocalypse, the minions of Hell rising up to engulf the Earth, stir well, bake for 30 minutes, rinse, repeat. This album is....more of the same. Put this cd in and dare people to guess if it's Krisiun, Abhorrence, Ravager, or Rebaelliun for instant fun. But there's another side of me that thinks ""Why mess with a good thing?"" How do you improve on the sheer brutality and energy that come out of bands like this? Yeah, it's single minded of purpose and pretty one-dimensional, but nobody hammers it home better than this band and the others mentioned. If it's what you're looking for, you can't go wrong."
5,Great Deal!!!,I love this perfume. I have gotten several compliments on how great it smells. It is soft. This was a great deal. The company only had 3 of the 4 bottles I ordered and they very promptly refunded the fourth. I would order from them again.
2,OK,I do not know if they even make these any longer - these worked great for a little while - but then the lens popped out - ?? A little dangerous as it is small - I threw them out after trying to contact the company without succuss.
4,Puzzle,"It is fun to do puzzles. This puzzle is fun and educative, and I love Norman Rockwell. Puzzles from Buffalo Games were the best I bought. I did three of BG and they all were great. However, in this particular set pieces are not really interlocking -(( And this is a little bit disappointing.Looking forward for a new puzzle of Norman Rockwell from Buffalo Games."
2,"""Too odd for me""","Mary Gaitskill portrays most of the women in her stories as derranged, freakish, and monsterish. Each of her main characters have some sort of hidden anger, which have underlying themes of sex obsession. ""Because they wanted to"" seems to be some strange, creative release to Gaitskill, telling so intricately about everyday accounts, or rather of harsh 'subburban cruelties' that one would not think to find worth reading in a story, much less a book of stories. Gaitskill uses too many extraordinary words that throw off the rhythem of normal, everyday language she gives to her characters. This book is not worth anybody's time or money."
2,"No power, no message","This book was recommended by my writing professor. To me, her stories seem so shallow that I do not feel her authority and power. They are merely entertainment that you read before you go bed and not for readers to think.Another thing is, praising this type of writer makes American literature dull. No wonder many people today in the US do not read. So many books are just as boring."
2,Because she deflated us,"All I know is that I attended a reading Gaitskill gave from this book in Philadelphia on Valentine's Day, 1997 (I believe her selection was from the title story) and watched her manage to bore an audience of initially appreciative listeners to near-catatonia. It's amusing in retrospect, as Gaitskill happens to be a very attractive woman, dressed that evening in a provocative outfit with fake-leopard-skin gloves, and sexual tension was palpable in the hall as she began to read...and read...and read...The story just wouldn't stop, went here, went there, shapeless and endless and seemingly pointless...and she didn't even read the whole thing. Seriously, you could sense the air leaking from the room, the interest draining from brains, the blood departing from, well, never mind where. It was either a brilliant display of literary blueballing or the most fumbled public event I've ever witnessed. Either way, I've been afraid to pick this book up ever since."
1,Looking the other way,"The author seems to have a problem with the other side of today's society. She likes to add the issues that makes everyone look the other way. She also adds thoughts and ideas to the characters and in her stories that makes the reader think ""what does this have to do with anything."" This book might be appropriate for the proud western society citizen or the devout catholic. If you like a lot of controversy in your stories with a touch of morbid thoughts then by all means read this book. This book, has some good stories with some good plots, but ther rest just destroys it all."
2,Don't Waste Your Money!,"If you like stories that end ""happily ever after"" this novel is not for you. Mary Gaitskill leaves her readers with too many open endings and stories that really have no point. Readers should be aware of all the dark and strange issues she covers in her novel, from slight pornography to constant charcters that are bisexual and or lesbian. Overall, don't waste your money!"
1,One Wild Ride,"Gaitskill takes the reader from the most perverse sexual fantasies to the pressures and problems associated with family life. This collection of short stories drags the reader, however, through a muck of sex, drugs, and profanity leaving the reader with an unsanitary feeling. She surfaces ideas and mental images into ones mind that ought to stay buried. I felt that nothing was benefitted from reading this book. A majority of the book I spent cringing my nose at the grotesque images and ideas that Gaitskill presents. This book was definetely a wild ride that I would not venture to take again."
2,"Excellent writing style, but with an ugly undercurrent","Each time I read Gaitskill, I expect to like her better. The writing is so fine, but the underlying message and world view is simply ugly, barren and void of any depth or complexity."
2,green light...yellow light...red light,"Gaitskill brings up controversial topics that are sensitive to the average person. She gets into details and paints a good picture for you to imagine but her style is like a stoplight: she gets the reader into the story, slows it down with the meticulous detail, then stops them with the controversial dialogue that doesn't fit in right with the mood of the story."
2,style not substance,I'm not a big fan of this style of writing so this must be takenfrom that perspective. I wouldn't have read this book if it wasn't assigned by my teacher. The writing seems overly stylized. This book is basically full of metaphors. Thoughts are expressed metaphorically when they could have been stated more simply and matter of fact. Do people really think this way? I don't but I'm not so self absorbed in my feelings and thoughts. Some of her male characters have thoughts and perceptions that don't seem realistic. They are more a woman's idea of what a man might think or do. It's as if she projects what she wants men to do or say into her characters. The characters are interesting though. This would be a good read for people who are into this style of writing.
2,because i need to...,Mary Gaitskill's short stories are of a dark nature. She writes about subjects which most tend to shy away from. The shorts stories give a very vivid tale but to me is distracted by shocking outbursts and out of charater dialogue. It's not my idea of great reading.
1,Because I had to,"forced to read this book, nothing ever seemed realistic in any of the stories. many ended without a decent conclusion, granted, great writers can do this, this author lacked style. It was like she didn't know how to conclude the story so she stopped, hoping readers will think it was done on purpose. the verbal exchanges between characters were unrealistic, especially between man and woman. it was like women talkin too each other but the author called one a male. This book almost makes ""The Watchers of Waipuna,"" a great novel. the one good thing about this book, it helps to start the grill at the beach."
2,Boring Boring Boring,"This is not the best collection I've ever read. I felt as though I was reading some bi-sexual romance novel. The author's attempt at being controversial gets old within the first five minute of reading. There are some interesting emotional and psychological issues dealt with, however the weak ending of each story made me lose interest in the book as a whole. I'd recommend this book highly to insomniacs."
4,"Stylish and taut, but ultimately small","While reading this book I experienced the kind of vertigo I associate with the best writing; I was tipped into the author's mind, a distinctly uncomfortable and sharp-edged place to be -- and I was floored by her stylistic brilliance, her acuity and obliqueness. But the residue left by the book was slight: her technique and talent are apparently limitless, but her soul is cramped and stunted -- in retrospect, the narrative voice is smug, the vision of human nature is bleak and truncated and artificial, oddly starved. I wish she would match her AWESOME writing with a concomitant deep, true self-knowledge -- she could be a great writer."
5,This is a GREAT book!,"I have read all of Mary Gaitskill's books and loved every single one of them. She tells true stories -- the highest goal of literature, and perhaps the only one. This collection revealed a ""maturity"" in her writing -- just when you think she can't go deeper, she does; be more concise, she is. The title story in this collection made me shake to the core. Thank you, Mary Gaitskill, you've written a great book. I look forward to reading your next one."
3,Therapy,"The stories are interesting yet, emotionally disturbing. The author seems to be expressing her experiences, thoughts and feelings through the characters. Maybe she has experienced a sexual lifestyle that may have been disturbing, abusive, abnormal or fantasied, which has penetrated an urgency to release herself through other characters. This may be a means of therapy that has helped her deal with it emotionally."
2,"Dyes light, dissipates quickly",We followed the instructions and even used this stuff on bleached hair but it doesn't give a very intense color. And it doesn't last more than a few weeks. I had better luck with koolaid.
1,hair dye,"This product sucked I left it in for an hour and it did nothing but turn my hair like pink salmon color, not pretty or flamingo."
5,Fashion Fever Doggie Bed,I really don't know what to say except it is so cute! My daughter will love it this Christmas. I have it wrapped up and ready to open under the tree.
5,Alien Nine is Great,"I'd just like to point out that the above reviews are reviewing Nadesico's manga and not Alien Nine. They're in the wrong section.I have Alien Nine and found it to be one of my favorite OVAs and the books are great as well, going well beyond the OVA. This isn't a must buy, but it's something special for an otaku's collection."
4,Lovely Folk/Americana with strings,"James William Hindle delivers beautiful arrangements accompanied by a lovely voice. I put it on and was instantly swept into his delicate world. Recommended for those who enjoy Elliot Smith, Red House Painters, Nick Drake..."
1,One of the worst live records I've heard,"I like Bowie, and I'm sure he could put on a great show. But ""David Live"" is as zombified as he looks on the cover. His soul era produced his weakest moments of the 70's. Just listen to the studio albums like ""Ziggy Stardust"" or the excellent ""Heroes,"" and skip this bore."
1,David Dead,"The back up vocals and arrangements on this album are embarassing. His version of Edie Floyd's Knock on Wood is made of wood. His voice cracks and the band members are all playing in different styles-a cacophonous mess. If you want to hear a good live Bowie recording hunt down a copy of Stage. Better yet, stick to the studio recordings as they are all wonderful."
4,Good CD - Lots Of Disappointed Reviewers Here,"This was the ""Diamond Dogs"" tour despite the 'thin white duke' cover. I admit that the quality of the sound is not perfect, but it is as real as one can expect from 1974. Bowie sings his classics and what you hear is NOT what you see. Fortunate enough to have been there, I cannot tell anyone how fantastic the sound, light, the crowd and the showmanship was in tha tiny theatre. However, this is just sound and if you want to hear Bowie as he truly was in concert - it's here. For a better live Bowie recording, check out ""Stage"", which was much better produced. For a song concert song collection, I'd stay with ""Live""."
4,This album gets a bad rap.,"Fans of the over the top tinny treble sound of Bowie don't like this album,but if you like a little more full sound in your music with different interpretations than just recreating the studio versions with flaws, then this one is for you.The first six songs on disc one are great, from 1984-Suffragette City.The last couple of songs on disc one and the first couple of songs on disc two are a little lackluster,but Bowie really makes up for it with Big Brother,Width of a Circle,Jean Genie and Rock n' Roll Suicide.I haven't heard the last couple of songs on disc two because they were not on the vinyl so I can't comment on them.The bottom line is this is over all a good concert with more soul than any earlier or later bowie shows released so far.This would have been a spectacular single live disc.I recommended grabbing this one if you can find it for under $25.00."
2,Live - 1974,"Good, but not great. Sure, David Bowie's hit songs are in this record, but I just didn't like the way he sang the songs. For a better live CD, check out David Bowie's ""Stages"" album (1978)"
5,Amazing Book,Awesome! Dr Missler has delivered as usual! Interesting and informative. His historical review of coding helps the reader put into context the value of understanding the magnitude of what GOD has done in the Bible.
3,Take it with a grain of salt,"I found this movie rather so so. Some of the scenes were quite touching, but some of the events in the movie were just too improbable. The refs disallowed the first goal by the chimp because he was an ineligible player, why did they not disallow a later goal for the same reason? I thought the movie tastefully done on the whole, but too many little things rather spoiled the whole effect. How many households are in the habit of storing ceral under the kitchen sink? Just one of the many points where I had to sigh and shake my had. Still, not a total loss. I had the opportunity to see one of the chimps at a hockey game, and it is impressive how it could skate and shoot a puck. Some of the scenes are clearly borrowed from other films, and if one could ignore the more questionable points, still manage to derive some enjoyment from this work. Just be prepared to take certain things with a grain of salt."
4,Chimp film with lots of heart!,"I'll admit - I usually avoid any film that stars a monkey. I find them intensely dull and corny. But I'm a big Kevin Zegers fan, so I forced myself to watch this.Wow, was I surprised! No corny chimp humor, and lots of heart! Rather than ""The Barefoot Executive"", this film looked more like ""A Dog From Flanders""!The film is a bit of an Air Bud take-off. But that's good - because like Air Bud, the emphasis is on the people, not just the animal. Kevin, who stars in all three of the Air Bud films, plays another jock, but this time he's a star player from the start. Unlike ""Air Bud 3"", Kevin is featured in lots of hockey scenes, sharing the ice with not only real-life professional hockey players, but even director Robert Vince (you'll see his name credit under ""Hockey Players"")!The DVD features (an older) Kevin in the Production Featurette and in his first-ever (that I know of) feature-length commentary."
1,A Tragic Waste of a Blank DVD,"As you watch this ""film"" you find yourself asking ""Why was this movie made?""Don't waste your time or money on this. You will hate yourself if you do.1 star is the lowest rating possible, this movie doesn't even deserve that."
2,Almost awful,"This movie is very bad, infact nearly awful. Yes the chimp does do somethings like make cereal on his own, however he isnt in any of the hockey scenes. All of the hockey scenes are edited and have a pee-wee hockey player doing all of the chimps moves and shots. The characters are just as bad as the chimps skating, and were often laughable. On point sticks out is when the main character puts his 10 year old deaf sister in a junior hockey game (with 20 year olds) so the he can help the monkey escape the evil college. Stay away from MVP."
1,Go to the circus if you'd like to laugh at majestic animals.,"A silly little wobble of a film. I don't find these type of films enjoyable at all. Even as a child, I found it hard to laugh at the exploitation of animals if only for the sake of a low-brow audience. If you enjoy low-class comedy (i.e. fart jokes and the like) then by all means check out this movie...it will surely tickle your ""dumb bone""."
1,"WARNING! The description is wrong, this is FULL SCREEN!","Regardless of what you order, you get full screen, which really pisses me off. There is no excuse for only making a full screen DVD in the 21st Century!!!"
5,Great DVD!!,Arrived promptly and in excellent condition. I would buy used DVD's from this seller again.
4,Golden Years (2011),"Four brand new remixes of the classic hit by DB. All are well done. Would have been nice to have a few more. The last remix (Jeremy Sole) is worth the price alone. In one word, phenomenal."
2,Could have watched for free and still it would have cost too much!!,"Oh Lordy what a pile of claptrap! Yes I took into account it was fairly old so the resolution was VHS weak but that didn't account for that little pretentious dweeb they chose to play the prince, god I hate to speak harshly of anyone's child but that kid was insipid and if he was acting he definitely deserved a littlle mini Oscar like Shirley got!The whipping boy couldnt save it nor ole GeorgeC.Scott and the period sets or even the premise of the film which actually could have had merit.Oh well, can't like em all now can we!"
2,"Failed after just one week of use - worked well, otherwise","While it worked, I was pleased. It actually requires two slots for using powered USB components, such as an iPod, fan, or multi-picture card reader. Very compact design and works automatically with both Mac OS or XP Pro.Unfortunately, it failed after just one week. The failure was related to data transfer. The connected devices were receiving power, but they could not communicate with my laptop. Rebooting did not solve the problem. When I connected the USB devices directly, they worked fine. It looks like the data transfer chip failed or the connector for data failed. Either way, failure after just one week of use is not good."
3,Too scary for little ones?,"My 3-year-old daughter loves the Rugrats show on TV, but there are a few things on this video which scare her. The video has five episodes related to the ""bedtime"" theme. In one, Chuckie gets a new bed and thinks there's a monster under it. In another, the kids are home alone at night with a babysitter and scary things are happening in the house. If this kind of stuff could scare your kid, you might stay away from this one."
5,The Collection of the best Computer game ever made,"The Age of Empires Collector's Edition brings together Age of Empires 1 and 2, with their expansion packs. Age of Empires is the award winning game developed by Ensemble studios and Microsoft. I suggest you buy this game for endless hours of entermtainment. It also has a map editor to make your own maps. Its endless features includes more than 12 civilizations, multiplayer support, map editor, plenty of campaigns and scenarios. Even if you didnt do good in your history finals, this game is a must. You will learn a lot. I rate this as the best game ever made!Please buy this game..."
4,"Great for fans of the early 10,000 Maniacs","If you're a hardcore 10,000 Maniacs' fan, you probably know their early CD ""The Wishing Chair"", and possibly the work they did prior to that (collected on the CD ""Hope Chest""). The guitarist (John Lombardo) who wrote the music for the majority of the band's songs at that time early in the group's history left the group after the recording of ""The Wishing Chair"", before the band started having mainstream radio hits. He then started the group ""John and Mary"".If you enjoy the kind of experimental folk of the Wishing-Chair Era Maniacs, you'll find a lot to like in the John and Mary CDs.(See my ""So you'd like to know..."" list devoted to John Lombardo)"
2,Short book,"This is a very short book and appropriate for maybe Junior High School physical science classes. Maybe, some day, the book will be expanded and dive deeper into the astropyhsics/cosmology of the solar system and beyond. If you are looking for a very basic starter book, this may suit you; if not, skip it!"
2,Beautiful Music Marred By Muffled Sound,"Vocalion is a pretty neat label. They're re-issuing and rescuing some great tunes from the vinyl graveyard. I own several of their CDs. Love the music on this one, but it's got a very muffled sound. The volume setting is out of line with other songs in my WMP ""playlists"". So I have go turn up the volume then quickly turn it down again when the song is over. Be easier to nix it from my playlists, but then I'd never hear it."
4,good game,My daughter seems to like this game and seems to be learning from it.It's not a boring game at all.Im glad i bought it.My daughter is 7.
2,V-Smile has made better,"My son picked out the Sponge Bob game and I had high hopes until he started playing it. Even though the game is for a higher age group, I found the game a bit slow and boring. I'm not expecting the graphics to be stellar for any V-Smile game, but the Sponge Bob game is the worst. Winnie-the-Pooh is still my favorite, and Toy Story 2 and Nemo aren't far behind.I wish the folks at V-Smile had put more effort into this one."
2,Not interesting enough!,"My kids enjoyed it at first, but it was unable to keep them interested after a few days; which meant that they did not learn much. Not enough variation."
2,a little too advanced,"it seems too advanced for the age group it says. my daughter can't seem to get very far on it, and it says that it should be for her age."
2,an uneven hodgepodge,"This is not a coherent history, but a series of disjointed stories, all related to the original settlements in the US. THere is virtually no analysis, only poorly documented anecdotes. SOme of them are very good - the chapter on the export of ice from New England to the Caribbean will stick in my mind for the rest of my life - and some much less. From the reviews, it would seem that people liked Boorstin's approach very much. It grated on me as I expected something more from a writer and historian of Boorstin's reputation.REcommended as pass time reading rather than serious historical research."
3,Motivational but take it with some salt,"Do you ever feel that constant growth is sustainable? That by the constant struggle for more, shinier, bigger things, that people are just exercising greed? Well some words of caution with this book. In one point I even read something along the lines of 'refuse to look back at bad events'. Sounds like a river in Egypt to me (think about it).I do agree with some of the authors words, about making excuses for yourself not following through, but to me, it read like the words of someone who is finding more efficient ways to knock his way through a jungle without knowing where he's going."
4,"If you follow the book's advice, you WILL improve your life","This book is nothing more than many pieces of excellent advice with descriptive examples. TMOTB tells you how to be a better employee, a better boss, a better entrepreneur, and a better partner in your relationships. If you read the book, make summaries on some cards, and gradually incorporate the lessons into your life, there is no doubt you will achieve more success in all aspects of your life. Of course, reading and having good intentions is easy; the difficult part is making the changes, putting in the necessary effort.The reason I give only four stars is the following: the book was written a long time ago, and it shows. The examples are dated, ""he"" is used throughout, and women are portrayed in a manner outdated by a half century. Despite this major flaw, I strongly recommend the book to those determined to improve their lives."
5,A great book for improving self,I highly recommend this book on anyone wanting to improve there lives 360 degrees. You really do learn to think big when you understand how the minds thoughts produce the results you expect. Check it out for yourself.
4,Keeps you in perspective!,"We have enjoyed this audio, it keeps you from falling into the pitfalls that sabotage plans. Helps to focus on achieving your plans. I recommend it to anyone who might be having trouble seeing the big picture. Much success to all!"
5,Best Book Of Its Kind,"Totally Awesome !;-)This is the book Arnie read when he was young, you can depend on it!It's is from 1959 and the most valuable work on self-improvement and success on this planet for sure, no exaggeration !;-)"
5,Fast delivery and great read,The delivery took just a day or two (granted i live very close to where it was shipped) and I read it in only three days. The book itself is a great read and very inspiring. Very pleased with this purchase
4,Worth the time,I bought this used on Amazon from Goodwill for a few dollars (used books here are a great value)! Very pleased with the book. Not one of my all time favorites but I got alot out of it and it will be staying on my bookshelf. Recommended.
4,Great book but,The message and the book seemed more or less the same I just think it was a bit short. I don't remember seeing that it was the unabridged version but I could be wrong.
2,very disappointed,"If I would have realized this book was originally published in 1959 I would not have purchased it. The information is so outdated to make it laughable. There is nothing new in here that hasn't been said much more deeply than other contemporary authors. It has a sexist leaning, which I was able to overcome, but the simplistic advice was very disappointing. It offered nothing new and only touched the surface of the concepts it did introduce. I can do nothing with the information in this book. Not sure I will finish, which is very unusual for me."
3,Very Average,"Pros: Its a decent book on positive thinking and self affirmation.Cons: This book does not offer a new perspective on the topic. It simply restates the current notions on positive thinking.Conclusion: This is good first book about positive thinking. If you have read other books on the topic, do not buy this book."
3,Large collection of positive statements,"Not a very original view on focusing your mind on positive outcomes and living the right attitude. The author shares a lot extraordinary real life stories. Although it does not seem a masterpiece, I keep reading it time and time for some positive mindfuel."
5,A must read for anyone wanting to succeed in life!,"Was introduced to the book via a Recommended Book programme and have found it highly applicable if you are thinking of succeeding in every area of your life; be it spiritual, mental or physical. If you have not read this book, you just don't know what success is and how to put yourself in a position to gain successful principles in life. Get it, READ it over and over again until you fully absorb all the successful principles that are taught by Dr. David Schwartz."
5,This book will change your life!,I highly suggest this book for those of you who want to gain the proper perspective and create success over and over and over again. The words in this book have changed my life.
5,Excellent,Great buy. Everything was as promised. The book was near perfect. Came in about 6 days. Great read as well.
3,"it's ok, but there's better","I probably would've rated this book higher, but after reading ""think and grow rich"" by napolean hill, and ""how to win friends and influence people"" by dale carnegie, I have'nt found more sound advice in any other book since. Think and grow rich has all the advice in this book and waaaaaaaaaaaaay more. I have done my best to tell everyone I know about it. The reviews on that book tell it all. Get that book first, then read this one if you don't believe me."
3,book,"Don't have a clue about this book. i bought it for another person, there fore i dson't have an opinion."
3,Good,"This has helpful advice, but it's kind of naive at times. To overcome shyness, ""shake a person's hand and smile and you'll banish shyness."" I overcame shyness, but it took a lot more than that!! Also the money amounts should be updated. If you follow his advice you can be in the group that earns ""$15,000 annually."" Wow, I'll be rich! Woohoo!But, nonetheless, a lot of good is in this book."
2,Rambling thoughts,"Bunch of rambling thought as if you were listening to an old man spitting out life lessons. Lacks appropriate method of achieving the ""think big"" way."
5,Magic of Success,This book was recommended to me by a colleague of mine and this book really opens up the way you think. My views on life has changed after this book and I recommend it to you!
1,Misleading.,"I had been under the impression this book was focused on entrepreneurs, and not only corporate individuals. Well if you were expecting another entrepreneurial advice book like I was, do not buy this. This is strictly focused on how to get ahead in the corporate rat race. If that is your profession though, I recommend it."
3,Good read,This is a good read. I like they way he thinks and how to apply it in every aspect of your life.
2,Same old stuff,"If you have never read or heard any of this type of material in the past, then this book may be worthwhile. I felt that this book really lacked content in terms of managing our thinking and applying thinking principles to acheive success; the book mearly illustrates that thinking big is a pre-cursor to acting big, then it goes into a repackaged presentation of Dale Carnegie material - dealing with people."
1,boring,The book is plain boring and outdated for my taste. The message is clear but it is a message based on blind faith rather than on actual analisys of facts. I couldn't get rid off the feeling that the book was written for drop-outs and then retrofitted for the corporate shark wannabies.
1,Unhappy about the effects!!!,"I haven't read the book, but I know a person who have read and who says he changed positively after reading. What I want to tell is I did NOT like the effects the book made on him and I do NOT think these kind of books can make the same and good effects on everyone! I am sure the purpose of the book is not to make the reader more selfish, insensitive and hard-hearted."
5,Read and grow,"Not only is this book good for people persuing a career in management but it is also good for people that have not entered or are about to enter the work force. The recommendations in this book are easy to follow and are beneficial to even the most experienced management personnell. I purchased this book in 1996 and have read it at least once a year since then. It can really make a difference with an individuals academic, work and personal goals."
3,Very basic,"This book has a copyright of 1987, but it reads more like it was written in 1957. It's not that the information is bad, it is just very basic. If you're completely new to the genre of self-improvement it might be of some help, but otherwise I would look for something a little more advanced. On the plus side, it is a lot of book for the money."
4,"Excellent Book, for adults and kids","This is a great book, and one of the handful of 'fundamentals' books that should be read by people of all ages, regardless of profession. The earlier in life this book can be read (or listened to) the better, as it is critical to the building blocks of positioning life for success. It is easy to follow, understand, and has excellent tools/techniques that can be applied immediately. Probably a book that should be reviewed again every couple years. Along the lines of the 7 Habits of highly effective people by Covey, this book is another key read for strategy of life."
4,How BIG is this book actually?,"Most people think small. Being put down by their own fears or society, people shouldn't act better than one another. If you have trouble accepting this statement, read on.The Magic of Thinking Big is all about upgrading your life, not about making your first million. You first have to think big, before you can act big. And if you want to stay small in your career for some reason, you can still act big in your family life. Just pick the part of your life you want to improve on and start working!Don't think this book will do miracles for you right away. Every success comes with a lot of tears and sweat. Although the actions described within the book really guide you towards improvement, the only one who can really do something about it is still only you..."
3,It's alright.,"The points the author makes are valid. But, my problem is he wastes a lot of time repeating his point, using multiple examples. And the examples aren't short, they tend to invovle stories.I had to buy this book for a business class, it gives you a positive outlook on business and trying to think 'bigger' than everyone else.If you have to buy it, it's alright. But, I personally did not find anything 'magical' about this book."
2,Not the right conversation,"I picked up this book and found it to feel very dated. The paradigms are dramatically different now, and it wan't what I was looking for. I suppose I should have scrutinized the first chapter more before buying it. Basically, if you're stuck in a job that you want to bust out of, and think you're ambitious but don't know how to get from here to there, this may be the book for you. If you're already on a career arc and ambitious, it would be better to read a more challenging book like ""Good to Great"". Another thing I noticed, almost all of the examples cited in this book were about men, women did not make many appearances. I also noticed a focus on ""make more money, get a bigger house, live the good life"" kind of thought process. It seems to advocate that you have to be ""successful"" to be happy. Dislike. Well, take this for what it's worth but I'd recommend moving on. -Garry"
4,This is a very good book.,I was very happy with the book I received. It came quickly and was in good shape. I would diffinitely order from this person again.
3,Useful Yet Disapointing,"There's something darker and more sinister about the 2006 Nautical Almanac. Oh sure, the old standards are there-the 57 navigational stars (including Polaris), the Sun, Moon and visible planets. The First Point of Aries and the Greenwich Hour Angles, the Sidereal Hour Angles, the declinations and right ascensions-they're all still present. But there's a certain lack of joie de vivre as it were that somehow makes this edition less satisfactory than previous editions. Use this volume with caution, and let's hope that the U.S. Naval Observatory and Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office can return to their winning formula with the 2007 edition."
5,For those who cannot forget Frank Herbert's Dune,"In a context of a very disparate Human Space located in a small part of the galaxy, one sexomorph is selected to bebone of the 13 most important persons leading them. The only problem is, he does not wish that place, and cannot accept the human universe as it is preparing for it's xth Universal War. How can only one person deal an absolutely new card game, against billions of opposants who do only wish him dead? Once begun, you won't stop before the end!"
5,Great Movie,"I think that this is a Great Movie and wanted to have a permant copy for myself. I think that Mel Gibson is a great actor and enhances them, and have really enjoyed him in every movie I have seen him in."
5,Epic in scope but not in feel,"There are not too many films that are put together on such a scale - they simply cost far too much and reach too small of an audience. But in this case, everything aligned just right so that the pieces all fell into place to create an excellent work.Mel Gibson may very well have his moments, but we do not have to worry about him here. Everything moves along at a perfect clip, and the pace keeps going so well that you scarcely feel like you are watching a nearly three-hour long movie. Usually such things feel much, much longer."
5,Braveheart,Awesome characters and dramatic storyline propel this movie to the top of list for both action and historic genre. Story includes dramatic beginning of Scotland history and continued fight with Kings and Lords exploiting the common man and each other.
4,"It's just a film, not history","I get slightly disturbed when I hear people take Braveheart as a serious piece of history. There's an awful lot in the film which simply isn't true. Incidentally, I live just 5 minutes away from where Wallace was captured (it wasn't in Edinburgh, contrary to the film) and I recently found in an old walker's guide to Bishopbriggs that WW supposedly threw his sword into a loch so that the English couldn't display it as a prize!"
2,Disappointed,"I have always received good products from Amazon. The DVD Braveheart works 1/4 of the way through the movie, Then it stops and starts at the beginning. I would like to return."
1,false description of product,The item said in the description infothat have subtitle in spanish an doesnt have itthis was a special order for a client and doesnt want it for this issue
5,An Intelligent man's view,"I am a doctor, of Greek heritage, and have spent many of my formative years in the beautiful land of Scotland, and i would like to once and for all quash this historic arguement.. Quosh! there! Your feeble arguements are no match for my stunning intelect! Braveheart was a marvelous film, beautifully shot in the Highlands of Scotland, the flat sequence of Stirling's battle was filmed in Ireland and is obvously not Scotland to any mendicant who has ever ventured beyond his own garden. It is a tale of passion and romance.. vengance and brutality.. men and women.. Scots and English.. A Film for the ages i recommend it to all who wish to broaden their horizons"
4,Outstanding!!!!!,"this epic is on my list of top five action movies of all time!!!!the beginnings a wee bit slow, but the middle and the end is incredible!!!!!"
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!,This is absolutely the best movie I have ever seen! The best part is that it is based on a true story. Mel Gibson definitely did his homework researching every aspect of the story. I have heard people say that this movie is too gruesome but I believe it must be that way in order to be factual. War was really like that!
5,A Rare Movie That Is Worth Your Respect!,"Good movies like these are hard to find nowadays. I rented a bunch of videos and this was the only video that I wasn't disappointed in. The rest were junk and a waste of money, not worth a second watch.Not only does this movie combine excellent, flawless acting, but also directing, movie shooting, and all else. I have yet to think up of a flaw that this movie has created. Nothing important.The gore in this movie was great! It might seem nasty to some but it makes the movie more graphical and realistic, also shows that the directors really try to bring out the real picture when it comes to love and war.I'm sleepy but other than that, this movie was very good, a rare movie definately worth the 5 stars if not more."
4,An epic tale of bravery ...,"Braveheart (1995), directed by Mel Gibson is an epic tale full of war, drama, and action. The movie has a run time of 177 minutes.Braveheart is set in Scotland during the Dark Ages. It is about the true story of William Wallace (Mel Gibson) who was a famous commoner who led his people in a rebellion against the English.This is a great movie for history buffs and those who love war pictures. It is rated ""R"" for a reason though. It is a very graphic, gorie, movie that shows the horrific nature of what actual battles in that time period would be like.The cinematography does the movie justice by showing the natural beauty of the Scottish countryside.I rate this movie a 4 star, and would recommend it as at least a one-time must see."
3,"Inaccurate, and racist.","Braveheart is essentially Rambo or Lethal Weapon set in thirteenth century Scotland. It is yet another case of Hollywood re writing history in and stepping on everyone's toes. The portrayal of the English as cowardly sadists is nothing short of racist.However, if you do not mind being thoroughly patronized by big budget and rather pretentious action films, this could be for you."
1,"A fantastic movie, however....","I can only give this movie one star, and that is because I cried so hard I can never watch it again.Wonderfully made movie, however."
1,Rating for AMAZON not for movie,"Just to let everyone know the pre-order fans get ripped off by amazon. I still have not received my order and wont until the 10th. Walmart has it cheaper than what I ended up getting it for on this crappy website and I could have had it on the 1st. Me and amazon had a good relationship for a while. Thats all over now, NEVER AGAIN AMAZON!!!! YOU SUCK"
1,Ultra violence meets (...) humour,"Mel Gibson must be a very disturbed man. All his films are very violent. ""Payback"", ""The Patriot"" and ""The Passion of Christ""(which at least I found to be pretty funny though I don't think it was meant to be) all glorify violence.Catherine McCormack takes off her clothes in this film which is why I give it 1 star and not 0. Unfortunately Sophie Marceau doesn't take off her clothes and even more unfortunate is that Mel does. I found the mooning scene in this movie to be quite childishThis movie is intended for the less intelligent American market rather than for us Scots. All of Mel Gibsons recent films are marketed towards less intelligent people such as George W Bush or the Pope or Mel himself I suppose.Mel Gibson hasn't made a decent film since ""Mad Max 2"" yet he continues to make millions of dollars making these awful films.I guess...YOU CAN TAKE MY TALENT BUT YOU CAN'T TAKE MY MILLIONS!!!!"
1,Dumbest thing I ever saw,"Ridiculous Hollywood acting here in a film purporting to recreate the late Middle Ages. I laughed out loud at Mel's Mad Max getup, and his scene with his chosen girlfriend plays like a 1980s teen flick, only set in brutish times. This is a howler. How did this ever win 5 Oscars? Oi-vey!"
3,Braveheart (Special Collector's Edition),"Two times on this DVD it froze and then jumped ahead by 3-4 seconds. Not really a problem as far as missing anything on the movie, just think it should be perfect for the price I paid."
5,Wow,"Every home should own this movie. Everyone should watch it.Part false, part true - this movie is the story of William Wallace (Mel Gibson) a brave Scottish man who fights for his country's freedom from English oppression in the 13-th century.William Wallace's family were all killed in earlier battles with English - this time he's gonna Free his country once and for all!A must see movie."
5,The best history lesson I ever had.,"This is by far the best history lesson I ever had. The story is invigerating, the action scenes ar great, and the love story is very emotional. When I first watched this movie I thought it would be boring because it was three hours long, But when it ended I wanted more and thought it was too short. You must see this movie."
4,Solid Excellence,"Seems to me that several folks have axes to grind in reviewing this film poorly. This is a very, very good film for people who like history, costume dramas, ""English"" -- pardon me --- novels, and stirring stories of patriotism and passion. Gibson has proven he is more than just a Lethal Weapon-Bruce Willis type clone. Maybe not Olivier, but who is? What a good movie. I have bought it and watched it several times over. There is much to be enjoyed. Lovely score, excellent attention to detail, high ideals and heroes... and just enough romance to keep my heart swollen and my throat choked up. And Stephen, the Irish hero... WHAT a great addition. I want to take him home and have a few beers with him.Thank you, Mel Gibson. What fun!"
5,Best movie ever made!!!,Braveheart is without a doubt one of the best movies ever made. Mel Gibson is an amazing director and an amazing actor. I was so moved my this film. Words can't even describe how excellent this movie really is. Buy it buy it buy it!!!
5,unforgettable,"I couldn't resist doing a brief review of Braveheart, a perpetual favourite of mine that always leaves me inspired, regardless of how many times I've watched it. Most importantly, it leaves me pondering its messages, characters and storyline well after James Horner's intense, final score fades to silence."
4,Mel Gibson delivers in every sense of the word...,William Wallace's story couldn't have been depicted more powerfully than it was in this film. Gibson is ahead of his time with his battle scenes and effects. Could have done without the breast scene. This movie sucks you in beginning to end. A must-own for any Blu-Ray collection.
5,Great buy.,"Braveheart is my all time favorite movie and I have seen this movie over 40 times (no kidding) so I felt there was nothing about the movie itself that was going to entice me anymore. Inspite of that, I bought the Blu Ray disc to experience the hi-def version of the movie I love so dearly.. and boy, what an experience !! The highlands of Scottland, the war scenes, and just everything else in the movie just dazzled a million times over with the Blu Ray. I realized I was enjoying earlier whatever was possible with the standard def but I now get to see so much detail that the same movie becomes enticing all over again.If you are a Braveheart fan, you've got to buy this one and experience the magic. And I am going to watch it 40 times all over again in Blue Ray - no kidding !!Someday I might start a Braveheart Fan club. Meanwhile, enjoy this one !!-Deepak"
5,Taking on Goliath,"This is an excellent history piece, well written, acted, and directed. Definitely NOT a chick flick."
5,It's Braveheart,"This is the grand and glorious, romantic and adnventuours, thrilling, action packed and exciting, sweeping epic of battle and struggle of good against evil, the upper class and the lower nobody's that everyone knows, everyone loves and everyone has got in their vocabulary. ""...for one chance, just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies, that they may take our lives, but they'll never take, our freedom."" ""Wallace! Wallace! Wallace!"" How can this movie not inspire courage in everyone? How can it not reaffirm the majesty and mytsique of the glorious epic dramas of yesterday? This is a wonderful film, with a wonderful score, beautiful cinematography and some damn good performances. This is an excellent film and it gets my highest recommendation possible."
5,Most compelling movie of all time!,"Excellent movie by Mel Gibson. Portrays real life history of the battle for Scottish Freedom. Very inspiring movie. It affects you in so many ways, it really makes you think about how lucky we are to have freedom."
3,Not quite sure what I gained by buying it,"The movie is an Academy Award winner for Best Picture, so you know the movie is quality and an epic vision of feudal England and Scotland. Therefore I will not review the plot and story. The quality of the DVD is good, but I don't see a significant improvement over other DVD's of the film. There is some additional footage you don't get in the TV versions, more graphic killings, a bit more blood, and some extra love scene kind of stuff. Other than being able to watch it whenever I want, I don't know that I gained that much in buying it."
4,"Very Good, but could've been better.","This is a very good movie, however, I'd have prefered it was more well-rounded. I was wondering why they did not delve into the signifigance and source of the blue war-paint and pre-war rituals that would have further defined the culture and belief systems of the clans during that period in history.Instead, I was left feeling battle-weary and glad it was over.Costuming and sets were authentic looking, casting was good and Mel did a passable Scottish accent. Cinematography was very good too. Still, it could've been better.**Not for children"
5,In the top 10 movies of all time,This is one of my all time favorite movies. Pulp Fiction is #1 and Braveheart is around #2. Much better than Gladiator or any other recent movie w/a similar theme.
5,The Best Movie Ever,"This is my favorite movie. It is action-packed, intense, passionate, and makes you feel just about every emotion possible. I wish I hadn't given it away just because it was rated-R....I want it back!"
2,"Big, bold, beautiful, pointless","This big budget historical epic, complete with the most explicit maimings ever captured on film, and Patrick McGoohan's portrayal of King Edward as a villian so foul you are surprised he does not cackle, is big, broad spectacle in the Cecil B. DeMille tradition. Alas, it ultimately fails to give a reason for William Wallace's fight and fails to give its hero's cry of ""freedom!"" any real meaning. Apparently, ""freedom"" means Scottish women would be abused and debauched only by Scottish men and not by English ones. Wallace is definitely a figure worthy of a film like this, but I think this film misses the chance to explore the nature of Scottish nationalism, and it misses the chance to explore the remarkable example of a peasant who came to lead armies. It misses the chance to explore the collision of a tribal culture and a feudal one. It's a good movie, but nowhere near living up to the hype."
2,Dissapointed in this Blu-Ray version.,"This being one of my favorite movies of all time, I must say I was really dissapointed in what this Blu-Ray version had to offer. Not a single deleted scene. On NBC, Braveheart was aired with added footage. Why was this footage not included in this 2-disc version? Owning the DVD and having seen this movie probaly 10 times, simply having a little sharper picture doesn't justify this purchase. The special features in the original DVD are actually better than the Blu-Ray. If an extended version is ever offered I will be the first to buy it, but I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this one."
5,A MUST OWN for Braveheart and Blu-ray fans alike!!!,I'll keep this short and sweet... This is Braveheart on beauty crack... When running both the DVD and Blu-ray side by side I S%#^ my pants!!!! The audio is strong and the bag pipes and Celtic music will strum your heart strings more elegant than ever before. Mix the perfect HD quality and great soundtrack with one of the greatest films of all time and you have movie nerd heaven...
4,Major abdominal surgery the hard way!,"A friend of mine at work gave me the VHS version of this movie soon after it first came out--in order to help entertain me while I was convalescing a home after a hospital stay. It was indeed pretty entertaining with all the battles and so forth. But the final part, where poor old Wallace is drawn and quartered was really too much for me--especially given the fact that what I had been subjected to in the hospital was major abdominal surgery! To see all of those crude implements assembled and then applied to Gibson's character made me wince--especially with a few dozen surgical staples still holding my incision closed! I really doubt that Wallace would have been able to articulate even the word ""freedom"" after having his guts mangled in such a way!"
4,"Great movie, disappointing features","If you're going to buy this DVD, buy it for the movie, not for the extra features. The 28-minute ""making of"" documentary was moderately interesting. The greater disappointment was Mel Gibson's feature commentary soundtrack. Not only were there large gaps of silence (you'll sometimes wonder if you've got the right audio channel selected!), but even when he did speak, he doesn't provide any great insight to how he approached a scene. His explanations of some of the technical aspects fall short, too. Frankly, he sounds bored through most of it."
5,5 STAR FOR BRAVEHEART.,"This is a wonderful movie I love it!Mel Gibson is a great director and also a great actor for his role for William Wallace.I was addicted to this movie since I borrow from my friend then I bought this movie,the story was great and you can't stop watching it.The battle scene was intense and brutal,WOW! the romantic scene with his girlfriend soon to be wife was lovely and great I like the background music they use.Also I love the music ""it was compose by James Horner""the music was my favorite so I bought the soundtrack hehe!.So Paramount Studio has finally release Braveheart on DVD I'm happy for that!is gonna be great!I own this movie on VHS three years ago,maybe I might buy this on DVD too.""BRAVO FOR MEL GIBSON"""
5,Can I give It Six Stars?,"excellent cinematography is the main attraction of this movie. You actually feel that it is all happening right in front of you. for example: when Wallace smashes the Scottish nobleman's face in with an iron ball you hear his bones cracking. or, when Wallace impales the archer on a fencepost in the first battle you hear his bones and spine cracking. Overall, an excellent film, but it is incredibly gory."
5,Classic Movie,"Just got a DVD of this movie from Amazon. Just remembered this film, looked it up and ordered it thru Amazon Prime. This is a classic movie and Mel Gibson did the character well. This was a good look back when battles were fought hand-to-hand."
5,Great Movie,"Braveheart has to be one of the best movies ever made. The streaming from Amazon worked just fine too, there was only one brief moment where it paused, but that could've been my bad internet connection. I'd recommend this service/movie to anyone."
5,Kleenex Stock Rises Again Following Braveheart DVD Release,"If you are the type who enjoys historical movies, great acting, (and you like to cry), then this is the movie for you. When the movie released in the theatre, I wasn't exactly sure what the movie was about. 1/2 hour after the credits had rolled, I was still crying - in the theatre - in the dark. I am anxiously awaiting delivery of the DVD as the 2 copies that I have on tape are just about worn out. Yes, there are some historical innaccuracies, but what few there are aren't worth getting hung up about. The general history remains in tact. I have a collection of over 500 movies on tape and DVD. This movie, by far, is the best of my collection!"
2,weak movie,The movie is not engaging - it's weak - it's slow - it's long - and overall uninteresting except some scenes. fastforward helps get through it painlessly.
4,"It was good, but, You have distorted the true story","William Wallace was indeed a scottish patriot, but according to this movie he was more than that. This movie was excellent besides the fact its supposed to be historical. Yes, some facts were true, but lots was ...for you to root for one side of the other. Lots of the core elements of Wallace's character remained, but by fictionalising, romantising, and adding more victories they ruined the true story. ANYONE WHO WATCHES THIS MOVIE I SUGGEST:first: Know that this movie is not completely factional, do NOT base your public oppinions on this movie!Second: Study up on that period of Scottish HistoryThird: Come up with your own views of what happenedandFourth: Even though the movie has alot of non-needed material, ENJOY IT!"
2,Pure Entertainment - but also pure rubbish,"There's no denying the film itself is a ripping yarn, rousing and exciting - as well as at times brutal and downright gorey - from beginning to end. However, it's lack of historical accuracy and the fact it's so nauseatingly and ridiculously anti-English throughout detract from the overall film...."
5,One of my all-time favorite movies!,"If you haven't seen Braveheart yet, I highly suggest it. Something in the story struck a chord with me. I saw it seven times in the theater (okay, so I was a teenager at the time with much time to waste), and rented it twice more before buying the two-tape set. In fact, when I loaned it to someone who didn't return it, I went out and bought it again, only this time on widescreen. Now I don't loan it out anymore.This movie is a true story about William Wallace, a man in medieval Scotland who wanted to free his land from British control. The king of England is truly evil, Willam's loves are breathtaking and heartbreaking as well, and his friends are by turns loyal and traitors.The cinematography is beautiful, and Mel Gibson really should direct more films, as he really has an eye for the job.All in all, a film well worth its Best Picture Oscar."
5,Top 10 of all times,"Since so many people have already written so many great comments, I would just like to say this movie is one of my top 10 movies of all times and everyone should see it! This DVD version is excellent. I especially like the special feature - making of Braveheart."
5,Fantastic,Just brilliant from the acting to the directing.Best Film of the century for me. Romatically none of this happend of course but Mel Gibson will be praised by the Scots for the true portrayal of the english.
3,Good kids movie,"I saw Braveheart when it came out in the theater. I was about 14 or 15 at the time. I feel this is the perfect age to see Braveheart. All the cliches, the historical inaccuracies, all the flaws were lost on me. I was totally into the story, the violence, the bits of humor, the sweeping epicness.Now that I'm older I see for the most part what a hammy, hollywood mess this movie is, and I get why people don't like it. I catch all the little mistakes, the Irish instead of Scottish pipes, the glaring historical stuff, etc.But I still remember sitting in the theater being swept up in it. This is the ultimate teenage boy fantasy movie, nothing more."
3,Utterly Fantastic In Every Aspect,"From beginning to end, Braveheart delivers a no-holds-barred look at what it was like to be a Scottish dude back when men were men, and they wore skirts. Mel Gibson portrays this Scottish dude who knows that what he believes is right, and he rallies everyone around him to fight the other dudes. In the end, there's a major battle, and everyone starts fighting, the scene is totally awesome. If nothing else, see this movie for the end battle scene because it's totally awesome. This movie kicks major butt."
5,Very cool movie..,This was a very cool movie. Just everything about it makes it a very enjoyable experience.One of those movies you can watch over and over.
1,I don't really like this movie,"Maybe I would be more interested in the story of a man SO HAUNTED by his wife's murder that he leads his country to war if the protagonist wasn't smirking and looking quite care-free through the entire film. Maybe I would think him more heroic if the movie didn't show him, inside, on HORSEBACK, killing an old man who was IN HIS BED... from the perspective of the old man!! It showed Randal Wallace, the ""hero,"" killing a bed-ridden geezer from the OLD MAN'S view-point, I'm serious! Am I the only one who had trouble rooting for the elderly-man-crushing hero, telling a few lame jokes to his mates before lightheartedly rushing out to very violently kill dozens of people? The movie can't decide whether it's lighthearted comedy or gripping drama. If you like the movie, don't be offended, I just can't relate to it I guess, mostly because of Mel Gibson's Christ-like killer/hero; he doesn't seem all that brave to me, just really really fake."
1,terrible,"Some times I feel that Hollywood should stay away form European history altogether.The movie is so boring and so hollywood. It did not impress me,and did not decerve any oscars."
1,See Rob Roy Instead,"Rob Roy is a more interesting, memorable, and accurate way to inform and entertain yourself."
5,Very emotional and touching,"This is, without doubt, one of the best films I've ever seen. Want violence? It's got it. Want emotion? It's got it. Want it to touch you deep down? Yup, it's can do that too. It's not very historically accurate, but then if that's what you want then go read a textbook. You're as bad the Comic-book guy from the Simpsons. This is a film which works on quality instead of relying on a million different special effects (cough-Titanic-cough). The acting is very good and totally beleivable.I would write on but no review could do this film justice. It's hailed as great. It IS great. And if you like your violence without all the mindless machoism (eg. nearly every typical action film, which this is not) plus you don't like slushy romance but a little is OK then this is the film for you.P.S. It's anti-English and rightly so - I am English myself but I can see the atrocities that the English did and THAT is why I'm no patriot."
4,So what!,"If you wanted a documentary you went to the wrong place. Stay home and watch PBS and leave more room in the theater for those of us who want to go be entertained. With that said, this is an excellent piece of fiction based on real persons and events which I found very entertaining."
5,Very pleased with my purchase,"I ordered a copy of this movie from a reseller and I am very happy with the purhcase.As for the movie, you don't need my review...This movie is great both historically and aesethically.A+++"
4,a great movie,"Yes, this isn't historically accurate, and yes, the common laymen shouldn't use this as historical reference, but I think this movie does show medieval warfare quite well, not just medieval warfare in Scotland, but just generic warfare. It is horrible close combat slashing, and actually, this movie gets yer adrenaline up better than SPR. Yes, it's patriotic, and I dont like patriotic stories, and yes, it has (as usual) a cheesy love story, but what do you expect?? This is a hollywood movie DIRECTED by a Hollywood star! How could you possibly expect better? This is still a great movie in that it shows medieval warfare better than any other movie ever made."
5,AWESOME,"I didn't think this flick can get any better and then when I watched it on bluray, i was blown away. INCREDIBLE!!"
5,Braveheart,Mel Gibson shines in this movie. Well scripted and plenty of action. Battle scenes are tremendous and reminds one of the slaughter the Scots went through. I highly recommend this movie.
4,"This is BraveJeart, and not braveheart","Although commonly confused with a movie and title very similar, bravejeart is the story of a boy who excels and lawn jearts. His story begins in quiet Ireland at the turn of the 17th century. Evil imperial britans come to take away the bountiful lawns and lush countryside of the Irish. Only a noble jeart thrower can save the townfolk.Don't confuse with the gory, butt-brandishing braveheart."
5,FREEEEDOM!!!,"I think this is definitely one of those movies you either love or hate. I loved it, but I know some people who thought it was crap. Well, those people probably don't like a lot of movies because this flick was better (in my opinion) than many others. The length of it didn't bother me at all....I felt that this movie was appropriately 3 hours long, unlike many other long movies that could've been shorter. No, this one needed to be long. Definitely worth seeing."
5,Awesome! One of my all-time favorites!,"OK, so what if it's not perfectly historic --- this was a great film! Mel Gibson was perfectly cast as the Scottish hero, and the effort put into this one went above and beyond what Hollywood normally expends. Not since the biblical epics of the 50's and 60's have I seen a movie that impressed me this much! I loved this film!"
2,Braveheart,"Lush? Yes. Slick? Yes. Historically accurate? Waaaaayyyy NO! Too Violent? WAAAAAAY YES!!!I Love Mel Gibson. But his real talent seems to be realistic looking gore and who needs that?? I don't. I just don't need to entertain myself watching someone build an argument for a violent campaign of revenge and bathing in blood. Who knows who will build some argument in their heart like him and go postal, unloading on the innocent, unknowing public.And Mr. Gibson is having his own crisis personally. Perhaps he doesn't need to be submerged in violence either.... Poe."
5,How to describe this movie? Five words...,"Greatest Movie Of All TimeAs for the DVD, an excellent use of this format. The original documentary sheds light on the experience of making the film and Mel Gibson's commentary is superb. On most DVDs, the commentators attempt to talk over the entire movie, this makes most DVD commentaries unwatchable, as the key insights are often marred by boring filler space. Gibson only chimes in when he has something relevant, from key details and information like ""It took six weeks to film this part"" and ""that's a real scar, not makeup"", to nice little moments of trivia ""That guy is my brother.""Five stars for the movie, five stars for the features."
3,Best picture of 95,how can such an incredable picture not be on DVD? is this a joke? This film just begs to be on DVD. why it's not? i have absolutely no idea. Very frustrating. I'm removing 2 stars from this review because of the boneheaded move by the studio to deprive the hardcore cinema lover of such an epic and wonderful film.
2,Cheap thrills for mass market minds,Mel Gibson seem to be a mesochist determined to impress the world with his willingness to protray himself suffering with make-believe valiance in some cheezy pretense of historical settings.
2,Good movie but not complete,acquired this excellent movie but it brings subtitles in Spanish as the description indicates. Do not buy if you need the subtitles in Spanish.
5,"A pure, fascinating, extremely satisfying movie experience","What can be said about this movie that can make people like it more? Nothing, that's what. This movie is perfect. Perfect story, perfect choreography, perfect musical score. This film left me with a sense of awe that bewildered me for a long time. If you haven't seen it, make sure you remedy that as soon as you can."
2,Embarrasing,"The movie has its moments. Some beautiful photography, impressive sound and sentimentality galore for those in the move. But in truth it is really a very poor film. The plot is obvious. The characters belong in a second rate comic book. The stereotyping borders on the racist. It even makes the remarkable Sophie Marceau boring. Even melodrama should be more engaging."
3,A Pain To Sit through.,"This film suffers from so many things, its the same old crap you've seen before, kinda a chore sitting through it, Filled with clitches and oscar Wins this is another film that suffers from hollywoodism(If thats a word lol) But anyways it'll entertain Blah blah blah youve all seen this before, catch it on Cable tv dont buy the dvd.Another film which was visually good to look at Gladiator, suffers the same as this film."
2,Takes forever to load,This is a graet movie. I only wish it would load and play on my LG BD640 Blue-ray player. Any help would be appreciated. LG has tried but no luck so far!
1,Worst Historical Movie Ever Made,"As a true-born Scot I was terribly disappointed by this Hollywood ""adaptation"" of the story of Wallace. They got the names right, but that was about it. For example, Sir William Wallace was a junior lowlands nobleman, not a kilted highland peasant - that's a bit like portraying George Washington as a Native American. Then, yes they did once paint their faces blue in battle - but against the Romans, not against the English. Only about 1300 years out there. And so on throughout the film. The sad thing is, the actual story is so good in itself, there was no need to take liberties with it and mess it all up. But then, what can one expect of a director (Gibson) who managed to confuse the 18th Century British Army with the Waffen-SS in Normandy? (The Patriot) Giving this one star only because the review system won't let me award zero."
2,Braveheart,"Mel Gibson as a medieval Scottish Rambo. I spent the first hour waiting for something to happen, and when it finally did I found it difficult to care. The second hour had me laughing where it was supposed to, and I learned that the great thing about kilts is you can moon the British army. Hundreds of bare white backsides, or frontsides if you prefer. The third hour was a bit long. This was a loaner, and I fast-forwarded through all the action scenes, so it wasn't so bad. Since so many of my students write about it, I guess I had to watch it. I solved some crossword puzzles at the same time."
4,Cool but it makes me want to watch Mad Max 1 & 3 instead.,Nice job Mel G. This movie is a classic in my mind.The only difference between Gibson & the real Wallace is that William Wallace had a beard! Mostly everyone has seen this movie by now so if you want an opinion on the DVD or VHS... I say both of them are worth the price.
5,THE BEST FILM EVER MADE!!!!!!!!,Braveheart is the best film that has ever been made in the history of film-making!!! The actors are great and the storyline superb-even though it is not 100 percent historically correct! I love it and mel gibson soooo much-and no matter what i say-nobody will understand how much that is!! if anyone wants to critcise it in any way-please leave a message and ill answer you!!!
5,Awesome movie!!,"Nothing more to say. Mel Gibson, Scotland, etc. You can't go wrong with Mel Gibson's movies!"
2,mildy entertaining,"Who wrote the lines for the princess? Sure she looked great, but wouldn't it have been better if she had some depth? When Mel asks her why she is helping him, she breathes ""because of the way you're looking at me now..."" Come on! Give us some credit. I like to imagine her saying something like ""because the King's an a** who will ruin us"" or ""I believe in your cause."" Mel's sexy and all, but is he really worth the secrets of a kingdom?"
3,"Great action, sketchy history","I've always been a little torn about Braveheart. There are aspects of it that are thrilling such as the action sequences while others that drive me a bit crazy, the diminutive role of Robert Bruce for example. It's certainly a movie worth watching, if only for the battle scenes, but it also has some deep flaws. The acting is spotty and the history that the movie is based on is generally skewed, if not completely wrong. The movie is also long, and perhaps worse, it at times feels long.It's a movie that's best watched once with a lengthy pause before a second viewing."
5,Best movie ever made,real life experience for the age of deceit and cruelty with much war time gore overlying an inspiring and captivating story .
3,Only a marginal increase in quality,"Braveheart is and always will be one of those ""stuck on an island, what 10 movies would you take"" films. UPDATE: Mel has turned into and maniacal racist, causing me to have a 'metallic-taste-in-the-mouth' feeling about all of his films. Having said that, and witnessing what can be done with respect to older films (james bond films come to mind), i was somewhat disappointed with the final product. Comparing this BluRay production to, say, Thunderball, there is no comparison. They could have digitally mastered this movie, frame by frame, to remove noise, correct fade, etc. They obviously didnt. I was hoping this would be the version i could rely on for a long time. [...] It does have TrueHD sound which makes a difference, but the video side looks like it was just a straight-up transfer. In short, they didnt process the film at all, at least thats my take."
5,Mel Gibson at his finest in this 5-star epic,"Very rarely does a film come along that is worthy of the title ""epic"", but Braveheart has proven to be one of them. Directed and starred in by Mel Gibson, it is about William Wallace, who after a personal tragedy leads Scottish rebels against the throne of England. KIng Edward ""The Longshanks"" is ruthless, played by Patrick McGoohan. He is out to destroy Wallace and his ideals for a free Scotland. Both sides of the conflict get equal treatment, with a big portion of the movie dealing with King Edward and the Prince and Princess, played by the always-lovely Sophie Marceau. Running close to 3 hours, the film is never boring. It is worth checking out, especially for the incredible battle scenes. The DVD itself offers outstanding sound clarity, and Gibson himself has a commentary track."
5,Quite Possibly the Best Movie Ever!,"This is, quite possibly, the best movie ever made. Yes, I'm serious. It has a wonderful story, great acting, humor, romance, love, action, intrigue, history, politics, murder...everything. Very powerful themes of freedom, love, loss, and standing up for what's right. HIGHLY recommended!"
3,Looking for history?,"You'll be looking in the wrong place for history if you watch, but it's fun - as a movie. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good gore-fest/love story like every other young male movie lover, but I'm also a historian, and I simply can't understand why movie makers can't just come up with original characters to tell their stories and not go about letting the masses believe that _this_ is factual. In any event, enjoy the movie, but read some honest history before you start talking about Wallace's ""fearless crusade against the English."""
4,Great movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"When i first got the movie in the mail it was well packeged. The movie also was great. I gave it 4 stars because this movie was great, it followed history pretty well,but keep in mind this is a hollywood movie the dialouge was off for the time period.Movie:The movie starts with William as a kid, when his Dad and brother were killed. His uncle came and trained him for awhile. William came back to find his countryman still under Engish. He went back not for his countryman but for a girl but soon enough his love dies and he goes after the english. As this story goes on you will be very pleased with the story and special effects and acting.Mel Gibson:Wore three hats as directer, producer, and star. Mel did very great in his role anyone buying this movie will be very happy with the results.Hope that was helpful."
4,"VERY GOOD, A TRUE HOLLYWOODIAN CLASSIC !","Although not being historically accurate, this picture is very entertaining, gripping. Gibson won the Director's Oscar in a brilliant way. There are a lot of blood, of course. The only real weak spot is the unconvincing romance between Wallace and Princess Isaballa."
1,Junk.... Bad History and Bad Action...,"Don't be a lemming!While oft considered a ""classic"" and ""accurate"" concerning medieval warfare and Scots history, it is neither! The writer himself said that he ""...never lets history get in the way of a good story...""! If you can't make the REAL history of these times into a good story, then perhaps screen writing is NOT your true calling!The plot is perfectly adequate, as is the acting. The action has little to do with ""realism"" or true medieval warfare. The history? Just plain WRONG! Wallace was not a Scots/Pict warrior in woad, but a KNIGHT in ARMOUR. Robert the Bruce did NOT ride for Edward I and betray Wallace. Absolute RUBBISH.If you want a tear-jerker and schmaltz, buy this film. If you want a good action and history flick, AVOID THIS LIKE THE PLAGUE!"
1,Achy Breaky (Brave)Heart,"Mel Gibson, looking uncannily like Billy Ray Cyrus, tramples all over Scottish history in his relentless pursuit of the almighty dollar. 1995 wasn't a vintage year by any means but how this travesty managed to beat out the likes of The Usual Suspects, Heat and Se7en at the Academy Awards is a mystery on a par with the Easter Island statues and anyone liking prunes."
2,Not that great...,"I haven't seen Braveheart until a couple of weeks ago when I had to watch it in Alternate Forms of Literature class and I was excited about seeing it because everyone was talking about how good of a movie it was. In my opinion they couldn't of been any more wrong about the movie. Sure, the movie had decent acting and cinematography but all of the facts and the storyline of the movie SUCKED!I really did not like how he William Wallace got married and then just ends up doing the princess soon after his wife dies, in real events William and the Princess were not even anywhere near the same age. It really took out of the movie for me also because William has all of these epic battle scenes but then he just ends up getting tortured and dies and that made me think a lot less of William as a hero. Overall the movie had some okay fight scenes and the dialogue wasn't bad but this movie to me definately did not live up to the hype."
5,Magnificant!,Braveheart is definitely a worldwide classic. Everyone will love this one. Although long (2 hrs. 57 min.) it doesn't drag. I agree with the reviewer who said that Mel does an excellent job of portraying a Scotsman; unlike Kevin Costners sad attempt at being an Englishman. A must for Mel Gibson fans!
2,Bizarre. Blue Velvet in Kilts,"This is one of the most bizarre and disturbing films I have ever seen. A fairly predictable little story about a specific fight for freedom is turned by Mel Gibson into a picture of twisted masculine desire that makes Blue Velvet look like Barney's Picnic Adventure. Watch this movie, and think about what Freud would have made of all those men sticking REALLY BIG SWORDS into each other. It is not a pretty picture."
3,This is strictly a comment on the Blu Ray,I really thought that this was meant to be comments on the Blu Ray or the specific products from Amazon rather than reviews on the movie itself...SOOOoooo- I just want to say that I think this Blu Ray is not much better than the average DVD---sad because the areas filmed in Scotland and Ireland(locations per the Timelines extras on the disc) are breathtaking....you want the added dynamics of BluRay and yet the opening minutes show scratched footage and disappointing sharpness;Gladiator is MUCH sharper and has more useful visual contrast. It is true that Braveheart is about 14 years old vs the more recent Gladiator but it is a bummer to see or more accurately not to see the beauty and added enjoyment that Blu ray is supposed to offer;A shame because it IS a terrific movie--everyone who buys it already knows that and thus the reviews movie-wise are superfluous...
3,Good movie - but a few confussed reviewers...,"Just a quick historical/geographic note for quite a few (!) reviewers on here. 'British' DOES NOT = 'English'.People from Wales are Welsh, if they're from Scotland they're Scottish, from Northern Ireland, Irish and if from England you're English. Together they are `British' because they all come from the British Aisles and have the same passport.So if big Mel was defending, ""Scotland from the evil Brits"" it's not only impossible but a case of shooting himself in the foot. Also remember a large part of the `British' army in America during the war of Independence were Scottish, sadly a fact Mel failed to mention in `The Patriot' strangely enough."
4,Historical Inaccuracies!,"Let me start off by saying that this is one of the best movies of the '90s and one of my personal favorites. The movie itself is excellent while the amazing score by James Horner only adds to this picture. The normal viewer will get a great amount of enjoyment out of this picture. However, there are some rather large historical inaccuracies that provide the basis for the whole movie. If you are familiar with William Wallace, these will slightly take away from the movie. Otherwise, it is an excellent piece of american cinema not to be missed."
2,Why?,Why bother re-releasing this if they're not going to bother to release the director's cut? So they can re-release it again next year?
5,What an amazing movie,"I strongly recommend this masterpiece to anybody with enough intelligence to appreciate it. It might be rather long, but it doesn't feel like it once you get into the story. Hands down the best film of all time."
5,Perfect! Absolutely perfect!,"This movie is one of the five best movies I have ever seen in my entire life (the other four being Amadeus, The Natural, The Last of the Mohicans (1992 version) and Blade Runner. Braveheart is an instant classic, and a must have for anyone's video collection. Two items to note as you're reading the other reviews: 1) By Mel Gibson's own admission, Braveheart has no political agenda--he never wanted to be the poster boy for modern-day Scotland's freedom. 2) Braveheart is not homophobic. That accusation is the most blatantly self-serving, knee-jerk thoughtless reaction anyone could possibly have to this stirring epic. Buy this film...NOW!"
4,One of my favorite movies of all time,Good release but not enough. I hope that there will be a limited or special edition release soon like the German release. One of my favorite movies of all time.
3,Fantastic Movie - Average Video Transfer to DVD,"In my humble opinion, this is an excellent engaging film that I have enjoyed every time I have watched it. However I was disappointed with the DVD transfer - found it soft; it looked slightly out of focus to me on a projector that was perfectly focused. This may not be noticeable on a screen size less than 60 inches. Sound transfer, however was excellent.Oops, gotta go, it's time to be fed and changed..."
4,"Good for wood, but......","The DeWalt DW106 is a good drill for some applications. It is a lightweight, high rpm, dependable tool. It does have it's limitations, though. If you plan to do much drilling in steel or other hard substances, this may not be the right tool. It will heat up fairly quickly and just doesn't have the torque needed for the heavy duty jobs. If you do a lot of hole-drilling or screw-driving in softwoods, the light weight of this tool makes it ideal. If you want to buy only one drill for a wider range of applications, without going to a 1/2"" drill, the DW222 might be a better choice. It has 6.7 amps instead of 5.4 amps, which makes a significant difference. It still has 1500 rpm, which isn't all that slow, and the torque is unbelievable. The price is also significantly higher, but you get what you pay for."
5,Great Value,"I bought this drill recently, and have used it to build a few projects. It easily handled drilling 3/8"" holes through a three inch sandwich of tempered masonite and particleboard. The only thing that slowed me down was the drill bit getting hot. I did a side by side comparison with the Bosch 1005 and the Milwaukee 0233-20, and found this drill to be the best value. The Milwaukee was a little smoother and nicer all around, but it was too heavy and not very comfortable for me. Also, I didn't need the extra durability of the Milwaukee since I use the drill primarily for my woodworking hobby and for occasional home repairs. The Bosch seemed ok, but sounded kind of rough compared to the DeWalt (it was not up to the typical Bosch standards). The final clincher was that the DeWalt was made in the USA, whereas the Bosch was not. I'd give it four stars, since there are better drills out there, but because of the low price and great features, I have to give it that extra star."
5,great tool!,"i have had this drill for two and a half years, and havepunished it. much to my surprise, after about seven or eight decks, afew retaining walls(a 3/8x18"" bit through wet 6x6) etc.. it still works great, i now use it to install cabinets, and it has outlasted 3 cordless drills. no carpenter should be without one! END"
4,"Good Power, but travel case is difficult","Wonderful drill with lots of power. The bit chuck works well and reliably (i.e. easy to tighten bits -- no key required, you tighten the bit in by hand). The case, however, is a minus because it is too difficult to put the drill and cord away quickly and correctly. I suppose if you like throwing your tools into a bin, or hang it on a rack, this won't be an issue for you."
3,Could've been the best Wings B-sides ever,"This is the record that got Jimmy McCullough into Wings! A great hidden treasure for Paul McCartney fans. Brother Michael brings his crafty wit from The Scaffold. Paul, Linda, and Denny sound great. Why this wasn't a hit in the middle of Band )n The Run-mania is beyond me. ""The Man Who Found God On The Moon"" is incredibly innovative for 1974. A must for Paul fans who loved his 70s stuff!"
2,Good approach for beginners,"It was hard to believe folks were giving such high ratings to this book but reading each of the reviewer's notes it seems most seem to be in the beginning level, for which this book might be helpful.But even from a beginner's standpoint this book causes to lay on a crutch, Ro-omaji, or romanized Japenese words.The whole concept for this book lost ground by simply not including Japananese characters; Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji.Having Japanese characters is very important for whichever level.So, perhaps in a future edition of this book the authours and/or publisher will smarten out with an authentically bilingual edition.It would be superb also if apart from including the Japanese characters they recorded the examples on a CD too, but it seems too much to ask for now, as it is!Doomo ... Ja mata ne"
2,Not Cohesive,"I was disappointed in this book. The photos appear so dated that I actually double-checked the copyright date and was surprised to see that it is a fairly recent release. What troubled me most was that it seemed incohesive, with no theme or direction. Saeks usually does an outstanding job with her design books, but I'm sorry I purchased this one."
3,You get what you have paid for,"This Leviton was purchased to replace a failed 4.5 year old 1x1 RCA TV/VCR Distribution Amplifier model VH121. This 1 GHz Leviton is marginally better.Colour artefacts (noise) was present in dark areas of the video image on my CRT and HDTV's which would only mean the noise filtering of the Leviton is substandard. The edge sharpness of the image was soft and finer detail was also lacking.I returned the unit and purchased a 4.2 times more expensive 1 GHz Leviton 3x8 Enhanced RF Module 47692-3BY where the results were dramatically superior. Including improvements to broadband internet speed.Presuming you wish to stay with Leviton, you need to purchase and test to see the differences between the lesser and more expensive Levitons."
4,Good for its price,"I cant quanitfy the exact amplification I get with this Leviton, but it is indeed an improvement over a standard signal. And best of all, the amplification is pretty clean thanks to the FM trap. So, for under $30 you get signal amplification with an FM trap and a variable attenuator dial made by a reputable manufacturer. Which, considering all the crummy off-brand super-fun-happy electronics on the market, is a good deal.I confess I am only using this to amp local OTA channels, and have not tested it with cable input. Perhaps as the previous poster noted, it isnt strong enough for high volume cable input."
5,Best face wash ever-too bad it was discontinued!,"I absolutley love this product. Sad to say I wrote to ""Dove"" and they informed me that they are not making anymore facial products. Personally I don't understand this since I have been buying it ever since it was introduced. I did eventually find it on Amazon but my last purchase was ""VERY PRICEY"". Apparently the seller is making a HUGE profit from whatever he has in stock.All I can say is ""farewell to an outstanding product""."
2,"product great,but the price is not!!!!!!!only 2 stars & a sad face","I love the product....I really do, but It's not economically correct for me to continue to order it. The product is wonderful, and I DID enjoy it the few times I received GREAT DEALS....thanks"
4,See David play,"On this album, David Bowie performs some of his favorite songs by mid '60s British groups . Most of these songs were big hits in the U.K., but not in the U.S. The album works pretty well, for the most part. He has a top notch band, and the arrangements are good, if occasionally a bit ""busy"". Bowie is in good voice, although sometimes his vocals get a bit too ""hammy"". Think of this album as ""Ziggy Stardust plays the '60s hits"". It's not the first Bowie album you should get, but if you want to delve deeper into his catalogue, it's worth a listen."
3,Pin ups & pop ups,"Bowie's tribute to the sixties contains familiar and obscure covers from The Kinks, The Merseys, Yardbirds and Pink Floyd among others. The band is tight and the selection is interesting, but the sound is rather samey throughout. More variety or flavor in instrumentation and arrangement would have lifted this album above the ordinary. Using different producers would have been a good idea. The overall style is not dissimilar from his cover of the Stones' Let's Spend The Night Together on theAladdin Sanealbum. Having said that, I still find Pin Ups enjoyable to listen to and definitely more rewarding than some of his later exploits. My favorite tracks include Here Comes The Night, Friday On My Mind and of course the beautiful Sorrow with its lilting rhythm which was a well-deserved great hit. This new CD edition includes his version of theJacques Brelsong Port Of Amsterdam which is interesting at least."
3,don't expect too much concept,"Fun, but a throwaway album of covers.The only innovation you're going to find is in the arrangements, which truly are delightful."
2,David Bowie Pinups.,"The marketing surrounding this item led me to believe (whether my mistake or not) that this CD contained the single ""Port of Amsterdam"". That is what I wanted. That song was not on the CD and the CD contents were unappealing to me to the point that after listening to it once completely I have not had any inclination to play it again. I later purchased the CD David Bowie at the Beeb which contained the desired song and I am pleased with it and play it often."
1,Be Warned!,"Judging from the five-star review that currently exists here for Pin-Ups, it would seem this is an album you will either love or hate. Personally, I hated it- as much as I love Bowie, I can't deal with his James Dean-inspired take on '50's bop music, which frankly is what you'll find in Pin-Ups. Saturday night brawls, drive-ins, fast Chevys, Betty and Veronica- this is the order of the day here, and sadly David Bowie just doesn't fit into the role. The lyrics and music, coming from Bowie, are ridiculous at best and horribly inappropriate, annoying bubblegum bop at worst. Whereas at the album's release this one could have been dismissed as a bad take on a currently-popular genre, listening to Pin-Ups today is a horrible, horrible experience akin to having one's skin peeled off with a rusted bottle opener. Bowie does not have the energy to make this sad collection of lackluster '50's bop tunes even remotely interesting. First Bowie album I've nearly tossed out the window."
2,'Money-maker'-,"is all that comes to mind with this album. Cover albums are not only tacky, but unexpressive, mostly effortless ways for a musician to cash in on songs that as far as I'm concerned aren't theirs to perform or record (live is one thing, this is completely different). I can understand an artist who plays, say, heavy industrial music performing pop songs, because it's a unique take, but this album is a rock artist playing other people's rock songs, umm, wow?Don't get me wrong, Bowie is one of my all-time favorites, I practically worship him, but during the time that this was made Bowie seemed to be in a rush to continue Ziggy's success instead of making great music, though I do love Alladdin Sane and Diamond Dogs and Hunky Dory, but honestly I don't care for Ziggy Stardust very much minus a few very great moments.I do like a couple of cuts on this album, but, like other reviews have stated, it is disappointing not to hear 'Port Of Amsterdam' on here."
4,Odd Collection - Great Band!,"Bowie's first and only complete 'covers' album was a mediocre sales item, as most people wanted Bowie tunes. Taken from UK sixties hits, Bowie brandishes a cracker of a band and ups the ante with every song. Updated (at that time) to modern hard driving rock and roll, Bowie improves (in his own way) each song. ""Sorrow"" may be the slowest song here, but it's one of the best and one that's been chosen to represent this album on later collections many times. It's easy to argue with the choices, but not with the delivery. The band is tight and the sound is perfect. Not bad at all for a covers album. Definitely deserves a listen!"
4,Pin Ups - still sealed,"Pin Ups - still sealed being Bowie's 1973 release was a covers album and featured covers by groups like Pink Floyd, The Yarbirds and Bruce Springsteen to mention a few. The album was a major hit for Bowie and reached the number one spot for albums in the UK albums chart and the single ""Sorrows"" peaked at the number 3 spot in the UK singles chart. The booklet is really odd but considering that Bowie is an avantgarde artist it does not look unbecoming. 4/5."
5,Absolutely superb,"This is an album of cover material by one of the great masters in rock history. Just like Let's Spend The Night Together, from his Aladdin Sane album also released in 1973, every cut here leaves the original version in a cloud of dust. Next to Ziggy this is his best effort."
5,Sarah Edwards Is A Great Storyteller!,"I am in the process of reading this book, almost finished. It is SO hard to put down. Ms. Edwards has written a wonderful story about the lives of several different characters entertwining and evolving around community. It is very well written. It is full of life lessons we can all relate to and use in our everyday lives. I can't wait to get to the end, but also don't want to get there. It is such an enjoyable ride, and I don't want it to be over. Perhaps a sequel to this novel would be in order! Thank you Ms. Edwards for this incredible work of art! God bless!"
5,Rare good reading (and thinking!),"This is one of those rare books that's fun to read and that has an important, uplifting message. It is timely, too. It seems that so many of us are now longing for a true sense of community, and that experience is at the heart of Ms. Edwards' story. Her tale illustrates the refining process that doesn't come easily but that is available when we reach out and cross the barriers that reside outside of us AND within us."
3,Say no more JJ is against gun ownership....,"With the overwhelming evidence that GUNS SAVE LIVES, Bittenbinder's personal stance against firearms is unreasonable and unrealistic. The rest of the information in this book is better presented in another text by a well known former policeman turned Oprah guest and TV Star, Sanford Strong. While Strong like Bittenbinder doesn't like firearms he doesn't let a personal bias get in the way of saving someone's life. I really only give 3 stars as it is a decent reminder for everything that I already knew from reading Strong Against Crime."
3,It's a Good Video!,It's a great video for kids to learn about the bath tub and that it's not so bad and nothing will happen to you! My niece and newphew kinda like Rugrats so it was a good tape to get for them!! They kinda grew out of it however!
1,Bulova 96E02,"I don't even know if these watches are real. I ordered two of them and they both had scratches all over the bands as if they were rubbed against a brillo pad. I went to the Bulova website and the watch model number didn't even pop-up on their site! Also, kinda on the lite side for me. Can someone tell me if these are real or knock offs. Returning both of them!"
5,An Enlightening and Thought Provoking Analysis of the Effects of Adoption,"As an adoptee who searched and reunited with my birth family many years ago in my teens and have experienced wonderful and life enriching relationships because of it, I found this book an enlightening and thought provoking analysis of the effects of adoption. I had read it just prior to search and reunion and found it very helpful not only in dealing with emotions, and relationships but to know the other experiences of other adoptees. It's an extremely helpful book in shedding light on the many issues in the psychology of the adopted."
3,"mmm, bad game, but addictive","this game is really boring, and the riding is impossible. You lose money like every day. It is neat how you can breed your horses. The foals are really cute. I lost this game, but am still looking for it. I gave up making money and just kept breeding my horses and selling some of the foals. Well, if your looking for super fun games, don't get this."
4,"Pretty bugged, but good otherwise!","Let's Ride: Sunshine Stables is pretty addicting to any horse lover, but many things could definitely be improved if they were to make a second GameBoy version. You should be able to enter your horse in some competitions, maybe pause the game on the course or during ride-out, and also there is a HUGE money bug. Half cheat, half bug, I like this! Every few rounds, make sure you have at least one empty stall (and no horse named Sweet Bee), then go to the office, go to the horse breeder, and go to try and buy a mare. Go down to the last mare on the list. Every few rounds, if you're lucky, the horse will have a price of anywhere from -16000000 to -106000000. Nicely done!"
2,Dull,I tried to like it so I dont feel like I wasted my money but. It just to dull maybe the reson boys dont want to play game that are aimed at girls is because you make them so dull and boring . Girls love horses yes but put so excitement in the games girls like action and fun to . grow up not all girl stuff should be dull .
4,A fun game,I really enjoy it. I sit and play it for hours. A fun game for horselovers. My dad bought it for me and I am glad he did. I recommend it to others who love playing horse games.
3,"Great design, crappy materials","I love this wallet, but the ""leather"" tore where the snaps attach due to pulling it open repeatedly. Now i have to hold down the base of the snaps with my fingernails to not tear further and open it..."
3,Last Unicorn Wallet w/chain,"I really like it. It's too cute. Bought this with the trucker hat and pink T-shirt (careful, the T shrunk in the wash a little). I like all the items. The chain is heavy, but it adds that little something to the vinal wallet and makes it fun. Although I could have done with a different color than the pink they used. Violet or blue would have looked better, personally. Oh, well."
5,A first of its kind - Extremely useful,"To my knowledge, this book is pioneer in its coverage of the 'support' aspect of training. Most training books are concerned with trainer's skills or style, learning, trainee behavior, etc. Barbazette, however, chooses to provide us with the tools and resources that we all need to run a hitch-free, administratively smooth training.The book is brimming with useful forms, resources and even downloadable utilities available on the Internet. It is arranged in a logical manner and it is easy to locate the material that you might need if you are searvhing for a particular form.Overall, this is a must for all trainers, especially new-comers and is probably an indispensable tool for any training department or function."
3,Funeral Directing and Funeral Service Management,"This was a required text for 2 courses of my Funeral Service Education program.It's not the worst book that was ever written, but it certainly isn't the best one either.If you're new to the Funeral Service Industry, then you may find it to be ""right-on-the-money"" for you...but beyond that....JeffLicensed Funeral Director and Embalmer"
3,rather interesting,"Pygmalion is rather interesting, it is just about the dream that every girl has! Someday a prince comes and rescues her from all the trouble and misery: He asks her to marry him and takes her to his castle after it, and they lived happily ever after! It is amusing to see Eliza become a lady, but I must confess that "" My Fair Lady "" is too long, I had to watch it for school and it was unbearable. You could reduce it to one and a half hours, that would have been enough."
2,A ironical classic play,"In fact the story is funny how he learns her to speak like a higher social class. But if you think more intensiv about it, it is very stupid, because Mr. Higgins uses Eliza as an object and just wants to win the bet. There is no real friendship between them. You read and have always the hope that something interesting might happen. From the beginning you can see how the plot unfolds how it will end. The only tense moment occurs when the man who speaks so many languages, appears during the crucial moment of the bet during the party. Then you don't know for some instants what'll happen."
2,Just Okay,"The play was relatively entertaining and has a promising beginning, but Higgins' infuriating and incesant bullying doesn't change, and quickly becomes tiresome. You keep expecting the characters to evolve, to grow into something better, or at least different, and none of them really do. Doolittle is still lazy, Pickering always the gentlemen, and most frustratingly, Eliza and Henry are never truly able to understand one another. In the beginning I was an immediate fan, but as the story continued I grew more and more dissatisfied, and by the end I felt that it was a complete waste of time."
2,What a piece of crap.,"This play was very, very horrible. I give it a second star because at least Shaw (being a dramatist) at least had the sense to realize that this was long enough as it is, why make it longer by making it prose. It was boring, and frankly, I hated EVERY LAST CHARACTER. Shallow, self-absorbed, and the odd thing is, Shaw was celebrating these traits, rather than mocking them. For a while, I thought maybe I was missing some kind of sly mockery, but I went back and checked, and I hadn't. Shaw--who was a socialist, which should tell you something right there--probably should've gone with his beliefs celebrated the worker a little more (he got his licks in with Mr. Doolittle) and the elitist, idle rich a little less, in order to make me believe he was something other than a hypocrite and an elitist himself. And everyone winds up idle rich in the end, after all. Frankly, why did I read this five-act wasteland of aborted jokes and hateable characters in the first place?"
5,All kinds of hilarity!,"What happens when you pull a girl out of the gutter and make it your goal to teach her how to act like a princess? All kinds of hilarity!This story was smart and funny. I loved it and wanted more when it was over. I'll have to buy another one of Shaw's books. I just love his style. I can't resist any chance I can get to peek into the mind of a genius, and Shaw was a true genius. This story was delightful and brilliant. Eliza is unforgettable. She's intelligent, fiery, and stubborn and makes Higgins earn every cent of the money wagered in his bet that he can transform her into a lady. This is an absolutely charming story. I highly recommend it."
4,Fun Discussion Maker,"I thought Pygmalion was a fun discussion maker. To read the origin of My Fair Lady, or one of the origins at least, and have in my head all the dramatic yowling portrayals of Liza - it was fun. I assigned this to my high school students and it led to great discussions."
4,A Quick Classic,"This was a quick classic read. Although Higgins and Eliza are stubborn and often unsavory, the book had its redeeming qualities. I loved the calm patience of Mrs. Higgins and the complementary Pickering. It's a good story that's been re-told through the years because of its timeless theme of redemption, forgiveness, and even a spot of romance (sexual tension, anyone?). My favorite line was from the afterward: ""[Eliza] has even secret mischievous moments in which she wishes she could get [Henry] alone, on a desert island, away from all ties and nobody else in the world to consider, and drag him off his pedestal and see him making love like any common man."""
1,best part was when I was done reading it!,Pygmalion is one of the most annoying books I've ever read. You might like it if you enjoy reading about irritating characters that complain and argue throughout the whole story. I wouldn't have finished the book if my english teacher din't make me. I would also give it no stars if I could.
3,Great performances,"I loved listening to this on my drive to and from work. I had never heard/read/seen the play Pygmalion, but was familiar with the story, characters, and much of the dialogue from My Fair Lady. My Fair Lady is an improvement only because the songs are so wonderful and it contains Eliza's other adventures before the garden party (such as the horse race). The anti-climatic ending of Pygmalion and the ""happy"" ending of My Fair Lady are both some what disappointing though. I like to imagine that after the curtain closes, Higgins and Eliza somehow worked out an arrangement where they would team up and start a school for cockney girls to speak like ladies."
3,Bilious Pidgeon,"On the surface, the prospect of listening to a live performance of Pygmalion, one which could be shared with my students, should be exciting. Absolutely not the case here. Shaw's script, unfortunately, is brutalized by the flagrant omission of many of his lines. Listening to the play, with a recent copy of the play in hand, I was mortified when I realized I would not be able to use this performance. Too many lines cut. Be forewarned: this is an ""abridged"" version of the play."
3,an interesting play,This play is a interesting. We think it's a destiny that Eliza is going to meet her teacher. The play is not easy to read. In this play you can see the difference between the rich and the poor. Eliza it's a pretty girl and it is funny how she is learning to pronounce the words. But she is almost a prsoner in Higgin's house. We think Higgins doesn't like Eliza as a human being.
3,radio performance,"This is not the complete play--which is important to note if you were thinking of using it in the classroom. If you just want to listen to a pretty good (albeit incomplete misrepresantation) version of Shaw's play, it's good for a drive in the country."
5,A lovely story,"If you love to read classics, this is a novel that you do not forget. I enjoy it a lot. I recommend strongly"
5,Beautiful. A classic!,"Beautiful. A classic! Grabbing romance and play. If you like it, see "" My Fair Lady "" which is equally wonderful! I've had since 94' and have read it repeatedly time and time again!"
5,Gold-plated goodness!!!,A high quality gold-plated cable! I just wish I tried this one earlier...instead of using the one that came with my DVD player!
5,Great Product,"We have a German Shepherd that has a very bad stomach problem and was on medicine for that problem. Within a month on being on Life's Abundance we no longer have to give him any medication. The price is high,but you are also getting human grade food. The dog food is also very fresh, not sitting around a truck for months and then being sold.Life's Abundance by far is a great product."
3,GREAT INGREDIENTS BUT DOGS DON'T LIKE IT,"I love the ingredients, processing, and shipping but my dogs don't like it and the only way I get them to eat it is by mixing it with human grade food which I cook for them daily anyway. I just supplement with excellent dry dog food such as this in case I am missing things that they need with human food. I cook them hamburgers, and boneless chicken thights daily and also add healthy choice chicken and rice soup as well as cooking them brown rice.This company is excellent and even call you for feedback. I would highly reccomend this quality."
2,Forced to purchase by our breeder,"We were made to purchase this food from our breeder in order to pick up our puppy. We had hopes of just keeping our new puppy and switching our yorkie to this food. Unfortunately, our puppy was pooping close to 5 times a day and was always SO hungry. We also noticed our yorkie scratching a lot more pooping a lot more. Our vet told us it appeared that the reason our pups were pooping so much more was that they weren't absorbing what that needed to from the food and it was a being flushed out of their system. Our yorkie actually LOST weight on this food and our new pup demonstrated allergies and we were afraid of resulting malnutrition. Please don't waste your time on this food. Dogs need completely different nutrition than humans."
5,Great! Wonderful! A Must for the Devo Fan,"Very raw Devo material, and it's just great! Everytime I hear this CD I have to wonder if the band members knew what they were on to? Wonderful new sound that clearly showed why Devo became the masters of a new wave."
5,Must have for Devo fans.,"I've been a Devotee for almost as long as I've been alive. A few years ago, I stupidly got rid of most of my Devo collection. Now I'm slowly rebuilding it. When I finally received Hardcore vol. 1 in the mail and popped it into the player, I could not help but smile with the memory of these songs. As I sang along to the likes of ""Midget,"" ""Golden Energy,"" Space Girl Blues,"" and others I marveled at how, even though these tracks are raw and have a definite, unfinished garage sound, they are catchy. They positively ooze with Devo's philosophy of society falling apart by mankind's de-evolution through its pursuit of money, sex, and popularity while either becoming pinheads, monkeys, or robots in the process. These 15 tracks have an indelible place in the avid Devo fan's collection."
3,"Interesting reading, but...","I found this book very interesting and informative, but it's poorly and childish written... It's very easy to read, I finished it in just a couple of hours...Reymundos story is great, but he lacks professionalism."
2,boring compared to my bloody life.,"i knew this book was going to be a little less ""in your face"" because its about him trying stay out of trouble but man was this book boring compared to the first book.I don't know if its because i read my bloody life a year before once a king always a king and maybe my taste has changed since the first book or if it really was boring but man did this one bore me."
2,Interesting Books That I have Read,"Heads up to anyone that is about to read/purchase this book! I previously read Reymundo Sanchez previous book about his life as a Latin King, and though I did not believe all which he had written; I did consider it an interesting book. Unfortunately, in this current book, if you read VERY carefully, Sanchez states that this is not an autobiographical memoir, but rather a true-life story about the LIVES OF A FEW Latin King members made into the fictional life of ONE PERSON!!!! Therefore, like I had previously thought,this book is not at all true! Sanchez is a good writer and he must be given credit for that. But, he shouldn't have written this story as his own true-to-life events, when in fact it was based on happenings that occurred to a few of friends. Sanchez converts all of this information into one fictional person for his book, wants us to believe this his his true-life sob story!"
1,Proves that cheaper is not always better,"Book came with over 20 blank pages throughout the book. Unreadable. It was listed as very good condition. I just threw it in the recycle bin. Even though I didn't pay alot for it, it was wasted money."
2,UNREAL ESTATE,"FOR SALE BY OWNER is a strange, somewhat convoluted ghost story. Using the unsolved infamous Lost Colony of Roanoke in the late 1500's, writer/star Scott Cooper weaves a psychological tale of paranoid SCHIZOPHRENIA. Cooper utilizes gloomy settings, often incoherent passages and a totally ineffective conclusion. Cooper himself is totally wrong in the leading role. He has little emotional range, stiff and unconvincing. More talented actors are wasted in cardboard caricatures: Tom Skerritt as the credit-stealing father; Kris Kristofferson as the enigmatic homeowner; Rachel Nichols as the tolerant wife; Scott Wilson as the country doctor; Tom Bower as the disgruntled sheriff; Joanna Cassidy as the registry clerk, and an unrecognizable Skeet Ulrich as the redneck mechanic. And what happened to the whistling realtor?I did find myself involved in the movie, which is mild in terror/gore which is often refreshing. But it's not scary and the payoff is disappointing. Rent it, but don't buy."
4,Ghostly and hauntingly Movie,This is a movie about a guy that lets his mind run wild and ultimately loses it. The movie has a good dialog and ending.
5,Very good book,"This is by far the best book on J2EE and Weblogic I have read. I like how the author explains every single step of a project (the bigrez.com project), from design to deployment, and justifying not only every choice he has made, but also taking time to explain other alternatives, why they don't fit for this project, and where they could be more useful. The Struts framework is widely discussed, and EJBGen has found a little place in the discussion.It's very nice also to avoid ""J2EE for newbies"" type of discussion, this book is really starting where many other books and references stop."
5,Best weblogic/EJB book available.,"Just to be up front, I know and have worked with the author so take my comments as you will.If you are using Weblogic to build enterprise-level software you need this book. The author tends to stay away from the newer and more gimmicky Weblogic features (workshop) and delivers the information you need to know - in an easy-to-read style. You'd be digging through BEA's on-line documentation for a long time trying to compile the information and experience that went into this book.In wouldn't give it five stars if I didn't think that it would be useful to every Weblogic developer/admin.BTW: One reviewer asked why xdoclet wasn't used in favor of ejbgen. While both are basically the same idea, ejbgen focuses only on Weblogic and provides much deeper support and is supported by Weblogic 8.1. Unless your code base needs to be deployed on multiple platforms, ejbgen is the way to go for Weblogic development"
1,Not detailed enough,The book does not have detailed explanations - it just brushes the surface of a few topics. It does not really talk about the internals of WebLogic.I bought this book and now will sell it on amazon or something. Glad that my company paid for it :)
2,not what i expected,"this is supposed to be the new and improved x-o. i mainly tried the new one for odor control in bathroom, etc. as with the earlier formula, it really does not help bathroom odors, and it leaves behind a strange smell. they should at least have added some citrus scent to the stuff."
1,not working at all,"This product does not prevent my dog from making again in the same spot. It is as if it has the opposite effect. It does not clean at all, it stains more the area, it is as if it does not penetrate the tile because it is greasy. Besides the dog goes to the spot I cleaned with this product and makes again on the same spot. I am totally dissatisfied with this product. I want to return it but I used it already. It was a waste of my money!"
4,Good but need larger bottle,"I have used Bry before, but can't find it locally now...It does a nice job of keeping meat moist while grilling. Just remember to shake each time you use it.My complaint is that I would like to be able to buy a larger bottle or 3-pack of the original Bry (at a better price per ounce than separate bottles as currently defined)."
1,"Bible? ""Opinion"" would have been a better title choice.","Being an avid fan of the paranormal, I couldn't wait to delve into Trent Brandon's ""The Ghost Hunter's Bible."" I was so disappointed! I found far more opinions than facts, and it was absolutely full of grammatical errors and misspellings. This book appears to be one man's attempt at self publication rather than a professional work. I cannot in good conscience recommend this ""Bible"" to other ghost and supernatural devotees -- whether they be of the amateur OR professional level."
2,very disappointed,"I bought this book on recommendations from other ghost hunters on-line. I was truly disappointed. First, the book is full of spelling and grammatical errors. So much so that it distracts from the reading. Second, what appears to be hypocritical content. In one place, the author rips apart the Amityville horror case, basically calling it a fraud. He doesn't even mention that one of the foremost demonologist couples, the Warrens, visited the house and was convinced. But later, he uses the Warrens as they dealt with other cases, treating them with the respect they deserve; but only, apparently, as long as they covered cases the author was comfortable with. Third, he quotes the Bible in several parts of the book, and slams Witchcraft. As a Wiccan, I was offended to read that I was being duped by demons, practicing what I thought was positive magick. I am very disappointed in this book."
3,Very useful book,"This book is overflowing with grammatical errors. If only some of these publishers would hire a real proofreader instead of just running their manuscripts through a spellchecker program! If you aren't distracted by horrible grammar, you will find this book very interesting and useful. Although much of the information is redundant (do we really need a separate category for every type of ghost?), this book covers a lot of material the other books leave out. The sections about interview techniques are very useful. So are the tips for carrying out an investigation. There is also a strong religious slant to the book which comes through in parts, but like all books about ghost hunting, this one is slightly biased by the author's personal beliefs, so it is to be expected. Still, I found it to be an interesting read."
5,Listen to the music!,"Okay, this is definately an awesome cd, but I'm kind of mad how everyone admires and talks about how creative this is instead of the actual music. ""Sound and Vision"" might be my favorite song of all time. ""A Brand New Career in a Brand New Town"" is definately my favorite instrumental song of all time. ""Breaking Glass"" is another wonderful song. This is a cd that you can listen to the whole way though over and over and over....."
4,Bowie/Eno Effort: Strange Bedfellows,"After the dissappointment of Station To Station, Low seems like a welcome trip back to Bowieland. Weird in spots. Experimental in others. The odd thing about this album are the catchy tunes like Speed Of Life, Breaking Glass & Sound And Vision, those mixed with the ulrta-experimental instrumental trax make an effort that is fun to listen to. Beats Young Americans & Station To Station by miles and miles. Sure there was tension between Bowie and Eno, and you could feel it, but it kinda works. Better Bowie, definitely. Worth a listen, definitely. Strange, most assuredly.Dig it!"
2,Science Museum Type Music,Bowie has always been very creative and I'm sure that this sound was very unique when first released but it now sounds like something you would hear at a science museum. There is not enough vocals and the catchy choruses of his early stuff is missed.
5,Bowie's best.,"While the vocal tracks have an instant appeal to them, the instrumentals may take some time to unveil their beauty. But when they do, they're just as amazing as the vocal tracks. Every time I listen to this album I hear something new or different. I've come to recognise Low as flawless a long time ago, but I'm still amazed by it upon each new listen. It is and will probably remain Bowie's best."
2,Very Over Rated,"Bowie is best creating an ""aura"" around himself, and a lot of people bought into it. Hey if that's what you like he's awesome at it.Some very good musicians. There are some good moments, mostly Eno's treatments, but over all this ""technological"" marvel sounds dated and thin. It's pop music with a few of Eno's intelligent stuff stuffed into the cracks.Bowie has better albums and Eno has much better albums. I would recommend Eno's Triliogy: Here Come the Warm Jets, Another Green World, Taking Tiger Mountain over this."
5,"And to think, for years I thought that Heroes was better","I remember when I was talking to Bowie fans saying that Low is their favorite Bowie album, and that Low is Bowie's most critically acclaimed album. Well I remember listening to it for the first time and thinking ""What, how can this be his best?"" I thought it was a bad idea for the album to be half instumental. Man was I ever wrong, in my case, Low wasn't necassarilly an easy listen. You have to open your brain up to the music, and once that happened to me, let me tell you, this album made me feel a way no other music has ever. Highly Recommended to all music fans."
4,only one word for this one:,"WARSZAWA!!!this must be the most stunning piece of music ever written byBowie,the rest of the album is also VERY good but this trackis so beautiful it almost leaves me with tears in my eyes(andI'm definitely not a big fan of instrumental music)."
4,The beginning of the end...,"...Because five years later, Bowie would be making cheesy pop like ""Loving The Alien."" Yet, with the Berlin trio and the fantastic ""Scary Monsters"" he would go out with a bang. This, the first of the Berlin trio, is probably the most even and the best introduction. It lacks an anthemic single like ""Heroes"" but has no odd experiments like ""Boys Keep Swinging"" or ""The Secret Life of Arabia."" Instead, you gain a pure glimpse of Bowie making himself at home with electronic production and gauzy, ambient songwriting. No real hooks, but some beautiful music. ""Always Crashing in the Same Car"" is one of Bowie's best mood pieces and ""Breaking Glass"" is his poppiest instrumental. And in the second half of the album, you can hear the roots of trance, industrial and much, much more."
5,Career high,"Nice songs on the first side (Always crashing in the same car, Sound and vision), nice soundscapes on the second side. This was actually the only Bowie album I ever owned on vinyl and it sounds like it was meant to be. Great album by a great (but slightly erratic artist."
5,Yoga scholarship/Yoga history,"Yoga history is often written by those with strong ties to a particular guru or yogic system. Only recently has truly scholarly attention been focused on this subject. Elizabeth De Michelis has done a meticulous job of presenting her thesis. She shows how a typical Modern Postural Yoga class, her terminology to differentiate modern yoga from classical yoga, is a type of healing ritual of modern secular religion. We gain historical insight in to the development of yoga in the West that explains why many are more interested in postural yoga as an end in itself. I recommend this book as essential to anyone interested in the history of modern yoga."
5,"Light Weight ""Roto-Hammer"" Helpful in tight places!","I have used quite a few of these wrist ""bangers"" and ear ""achers""...DeWalt seems to have found a nice balance of rotions per minutes and beats per minute. The ""percussion"" seems to be just right to make this drill extrememly efficient with bits 1/4"" to 1/2"" - seems to be pushing it to make it drill 3/4"". It is a very handy drill for the tool box. I have used it to drill ""perimeter holes"" when adding some utility through the foundation-concrete wall - great! Also for drilling concrete anchor holes for Rawl-studs - super!"
1,2nd worst movie ever!,"Have you ever seen a softcore porn movie with no softcore porn? Well then, you haven't seen Vampires vs. Zombies. This is the second worst movie I have ever seen, (Troll II being the worst). This must have been filmed in somebody's back yard. If you enjoy zombie movies, do not bother with this. If you enjoy vampire movies, please stay away. The only thing keeping this from being the worst movie ever is that fact that there is a little bit of comic self-awareness. And, I hesitate to mention this, because it will lead to some hard-up teenager renting this movie, but there are a couple of topless shots included. The director was not a complete dunce, which is why this is second only to Troll II as the worst movie of all time. There isn't even a scene in which vampires fight zombies!"
1,Hmmmmmmmm,"At least they had the ability to make the movie! It may be crap, but we watched it..... Well, maybe!"
1,Movies can't get any worse than this one,"Watching this movie was the worst mistake I have made in my entire lif. I felt as if a piece of my life has been wasted because of the time spent trying to view this film. If you have any amount of sanity, DON'T watch this, you will be more than dissapointed!!"
1,Place under the genre of Horror-ible,This is absolutely one of the worst horror flicks that I have ever viewed. It is simply filled with gratuitous scenes that pads time. And I don't recall anything about an actual plot suggesting a battle between zombies and vampires as the title states.
3,Skinny Guys fight Till They're Burger,"Napoleon Dynamite tracks down Rollergirl in an exuberantly sexually-confused food truck. He way overpays for an educational deflowering, though only you and I know that he paid for it. Sex and the City meets Planes, Trains and Automobiles. Kalifornia meets Sisterhood of the Travelin' Pants. Gumby meets Pokey. Beware New Englanders: Cattrall, a UK native, attempts a Boston/Maine accent. Y'know. The accent that doesn't exist."
3,dixieland,qualité du produit reu tel que décrite par le vendeur.réception rapidesurveillance d'AMAZONE est effiquace confirmée par leur vérification.en ce qui concerne le C D le son de l'enregistrement est passable.excellent custummer service
5,A visually stunning and artistically done docudrama of Patrick,Very artistically and beautifully done. There is so little primary documents on the legendary life of Patrick. This docudrama has compensated with visuals from the Emerald Island and beautifully done photography. The best DVD of Patrick that I have seen.
4,Well done,"Portrayal of Patrick's kidnapping to Ireland, followed by his escape, and returning home only to voluntarily return to Ireland. Documentary style at times glosses over periods of his life while going into deeper detail of others. Overall, conveys the material in an understandable way and who couldn't listen to Liam Neeson for hours!"
4,An informative biographical film,"This was different than I thought it was when I bought it. I had thought that Liam Neeson was playing ""himself"" (meaning the Bishop of Armagh). He narrates the documentary. This is an informative film of about 1 hour's length, and should be useful for schools, or for Irish American parents who are trying to reconnect with the auld sod, or instill some sense of heritage in their children. Enjoy, and may you be in heaven an hour before the devil knows you're dead."
2,"My, oh, my.","You know you're not getting a quality Latin American Spanish DVD when the titles to one of the stories ""Los doce meses"" is shamefully misspelled as ""Los Doses Meses"" right on the cover. Pathetic. Did any important figure in this studio even took a glance at the cover prior to distributing? Good Lord..."
1,FLimsy,This item was not sturdy.The control knobs you use aren't able to move the marble as precisely as they should so getting the ball to the end isn't going to happen. It's kind of stiff or something. Can't really put my finger on it. Wouldn't buy again.
1,"Complex, flimsy, unstable","Bought this with high hopes because of its compact design and supposedly good features - BUT: 1) The setup is very long and tedious. And if you don't complete it the moment you change batteries, it's very difficult to do so later. 2) The buttons have all the tactile feedback of a pencil eraser. They are almost impossible to operate. Very poor quality. 3) The darn thing keeps falling off! And every time it falls off, the battery pops out and it forgets everything, of course, and so it demands that you go through the tedious setup again. Basically, I have never bought anything Made In China by Oregon Scientific and NOT been bitterly disappointed."
1,Does not work,You would think in this day and age with the technology we have that a devise could not fail so miserably. It is really hard to use and just does not seem to work as far as I can tell. I have given it a few days and keep going back to the instructions to see if I can get more out of them. The control buttons are really hard to use. I just wish I had done a little reading up on pedometers before I bought this one.
1,Do not buy this product.,I purchased this product and it is impossible to program. You are not able to program the pedometer since the side buttons are so small and difficult to manuever. I basically threw away my money. Do not buy this product.
1,Disappointed!,"""In My Wildest Dreams"" portrays Rowena de Bernard, an exile from France after Napoleon's conquests, and Captain Tarquin York (Quinn for short), a British cavalry officer falling in love as he escorts her back to France. Of course there are French armies trying to kill them, so as they go through difficult times together, they are brought closer until they fall in love.To be honest, I got all that info from the back of the book. I couldn't get past page 67. I read Ellen Tanner Marsh's ""The Enchanted Prince"" which I loved very much, so I made an effort to get this out of print book. Unlike ""The Enchanted Prince,"" I found the characters unremarkable and boring. Thus, despite all the ""exciting"" things happening around them, I didn't care.Don't waste your money...instead, check out ""The Enchanted Prince,"" which was sweet and loosely based upon the fairy tale, ""The Frog Prince."""
2,Not their best item. Don't be fooled by the picture.,"First off I would like to say that I LOVE Silver Insanity items and have bought things from them numerous times. They are a good company with quality items, but this item is not one of their best. I think they should just take it out of their inventory. I'm sad to say that this item looks much better in the picture than in real life. The metal is of poor quality, not like their usual silver products, The globe itself actually looks really cheap and ugly. I'm thinking that maybe if I found a round stone to fit inside and glued the lock shut then it might work, depending on if I can get the metal shined up to standard. Right now it's been sitting in my jewelry box for over a year and I have never actually worn it yet. Also the lock mechanism on it doesn't stay closed all the time."
2,Got Conned,"The picture online was so beautiful. To me it reminded me of the Cat collar, ""Orion's Belt"" from the first Men In Black movie. Not that big of a MIB fan, although I was interested in a necklace look-a-like I searched online and stumbled across this pendant.When I finally got it I was severely disappointed. The cage that was supposed to ""open"" Was stuck and I broke a nail attempting to open it. It's about the size of a quarter and doesn't even come with a chain.The small hole where the chain goes through is about the size of a needle head. Most of my chains wouldn't fit and the ones that did were too delicate for this half pound paper weight.The globe itself is very beautiful but the thick fake gold gridlines running through the entire globe ruin the effect.I wasn't SEVERELY disappointed but then again I didn't think I would pay nearly $40 for something the size of a bottle cap."
2,rough looking,The earth is very unclear and the holder rough looking. I was expecting a more fine piece of jewelry.
4,Sterling Silver Caged Earth Globe Pendant,Item is very cool. Took a long time to get item and got no response when emailing vendor. Might use vendor again
2,Can't trust the lock.,"I have only had this piece for two days. I received it as a gift. I no longer have it. The lock on the cage opened at some point and the globe is now gone. I loved this piece. It has been on my wish list for two years. I am terribly dissapointed, and will be contacting the seller to request a refund, or a replacement of the globe. I had contemplated wireing it shut... had i been able to find the globe."
2,"Cool stone, bad lock!","I bought this necklace for my wife and she loves it. The globe inside is a deep blue, and the continents are made up of different stones. The quality of the chain seems good, and the globe is not too bulky, so she can wear it comfortably without feeling like there is a giant ball hanging around her neck. The bad thing about this item is the lock that keeps the stone globe inside the case. It is just a little tab that clicks into a hole, but either the tab is not big enough or the hole is not deep enough. We have had the globe pop out five times now. Luckily it's been in the mall or while we were walking through a parking lot, so we were able to retrieve the globe every time. My wife is scared to wear it out of the house now, so it is just sitting on the dresser until we figure out how to rig the lock to make it hold better."
5,Carry the world with you,"Recieved this from my girlfriend and she wrote a very inspirational message (So it's a great gift idea!) Necklace is BEAUTIFUL, stands out and extremely well made...recieve many compliments. You can't lose with this piece"
2,Disappointed!,"Although I was pleased with the overall appearance of this pendant, after opening the world cage the clip fastener refused to re-fasten properly. It cannot be worn with confidence. Too bad!"
3,Don't open the clasp!,I loved this necklace when I saw it online and even more when I got it for Christmas. It's unusual and pretty and felt special. On Christmas I unclasped it and looked at the globe. 2 weeks later I realized I hadn't really looked at it closely and did the same. Then I spent a half hour trying to get the clasp to shut. Eventually I got it and it held for several hours but I'm pretty much just waiting for it to open. It just doesn't seem able to fasten securely. Time will tell. But I love it a lot less now that I'm not sure if it will break any minute and after only 2 weeks!Even though I like it I'm not sure I would have bought it if I'd known it would break or better yet I just wouldn't have opened the clasp.
4,silver insanity,I needed to hold an item in a cage and Silver Insanity had some very cool options. I selected the Caged Earth Globe Pendant. It was all it was portrayed to be and it came very quickly. The only reason I don't give it a five rating is that I had to glue the clasp closed permanently as it came open when brushed against by shirts or whatever. I would use Silver Insanity again because the selection was so interesting.
5,Very useful for anything you want to drive,I had a chance to use this screwdriver this past weekend and found to have plenty of power to put drywall up and to put in deck screws through redwood decking it worked great. the set and forget nosepiece was handy. i can't say enough about this dewalt we own many dewalt and other brand tools and this dewalt does not let us down.
4,NEEDS A LOCK,"OVERALL I AM WELL PLEASED, I INADVERTANTLY KEEP KEEP CHANGING MY DEPTH ADJUSTMENT BY GRIPPING THE END OF THE GUN TO DIRECT THE SCREW TO TIGHT SPOTS."
5,Very Good Joe McDonald Music.,Nice Songs From Joe. Very Good Addition Of Jerry Garcia On A Couple Of Songs.Buy It You Will Like It.
4,Good Series,"This is a good series for anyone who needs to make the Bible ""come alive."" I am a pastor and have been buying all the books in this series. You won't be wasting your money.It provides a theological perspective as well as ""modernizing"" the stories. I enjoy it and hope you do as well."
1,Your Co send the DVD in wrong region 2 to me( it should be region1)because I live in US. It was too late to return & replaced.,Your Co. send the dvd in wrong region 2 to me (it should be region 1)because I live in US. It was too late to return & replaced other dvd. It was a gift . When my told me the dvd wrong region. It was too late to return date has pass.
4,A good mystery novel!,Mary Higgins Clark keeps you turning the pages and guessing who the killer is. I reccomend this book...it was great!
4,"Good book, slow start","This book was very good and very suspensful. The characters were believable, but the plotline would be hard to follow if you are confused by the author changing viewpoints. If you don't like books that go from one character to the next, this book may not be for you. The story line is a little bit slow and some parts seem to drag on. All in all this was a great book and a good read!"
1,awful,"I must've read a different book than most of the other reviewers. I thought it was terrible. I have read other books by the author a long time ago and enjoyed them, if I remember correctly. Either the author has gotten that much worse or , probably, I have been exposed to MUCH better writers! I have placed this author on my ""no more"" list."
1,This is the worst book I've ever read!!!,The theme of this book is good. I didn't like the way it was written. Mary Higgins Clark obviously wanted to style it and make it look like a movie. But it added nothing to the story.
1,The Worst book I've ever read,This is the worst book I've ever read. The parts are not connected to each other. The author jumped from one scene to the other.
3,Let Me Call You Sweetheart,"Let Me Call You Sweetheart, by Mary Higgins Clark, was well written, but was not her best book. I found myself getting confused by the continuous scene changes. I enjoyed the book, but I have read better. This mystery had a good plot and Clark was very descriptive. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes mysteries, but before reading this I would try one of Clark's other books."
2,"Pretty Good, Not the Best","Clark is very talented, but doesn't show it in this book compared to some of her others. At some points the different stories all blend together and get rather confusing. If you love Mary Higgins Clark, I'd go for a different book."
2,Pseudo-personality. . .?,"While being a regular reader of Mrs. Higgins-Clark, I just couldn't get myself to understand how a talented lady like herself could write a book like Let Me Call You Sweetheart. While the idea behind the book is quite good and original, the building of suspens is mediocre and her character cartoonish. This is not what she usually writes. That brings us to ask ourselves one question... Is that the same Mary Higgins-Clark who brought us such succulent novels like Silent Night and Moonlight Becomes You, or was this written by a low-budget copy-cat. The ladder would seem the saner thing to think.."
2,"Was a dissapointment, not MHC's best","I've read about 10 Mary Higgins Clarks books and many people said this one was great. It was not. The story jumped around and got confusing and the end was a total disappointment. It was like she couldn't think of an ending, although she dropped lots of hints what it would be, but you just didn't believe she would do it. Don't give up on her, just don't bother reading this one."
2,is this all there is?,"so many holes you could drive a truck through the plot... soft, sappy and silly... is this the best this author can write? i was surprised this wasn't her first book!"
3,"For little hands, buy the jumbo ones instead","I have both the Melissa & Doug Triangular Crayons and the Jumbo Triangular Crayons. My 2yr old loves to color, and she was snapping all the Crayola crayons in half, so I bought these. The Jumbo crayons (10pack or 12pack), are great...the 24pack like this one, has more colors which is great, but she is able to break these in half as well and is leaving broken, expensive crayons everywhere. You also cannot sharpen these, so if you ever need a finer tip, you have to keep coloring to 'widdle' down the tips."
5,"Sturdy, Nice Colors","This set has pretty colors and good color saturation (you don't have to press hard to get rich color) in comparison to some other brands. I like the red case, and will try to reuse it as much as possible to make this a more environmentally friendly purchase."
5,Great crayons in a great container,"These crayons are great! First off, the colors are vibrant and there is a good variety of colors. My daughters (2 and 4 years old) have no problems coloring with these. We have had these crayons for six months and not one has broken. We have also not lost one! I think this is mainly because it is easy for my daughters to see when they are missing one and they then search until it is found. I also like that the container is a little difficult to open. This means that my two-year old can't get the crayons while unsupervised, but my four-year old help herself when coloring. Another benefit of the flat container is that it displays all the colors - no guessing what color you are grabbing out of a box or dumping them out all over the place just to see them. I will definitely buy more when these need to be replaced!"
3,Great Crayons,"These crayons were great! Not as strong as they said, but as long as you're kid isn't going all out pressing on them like a brute, they are pretty average. They're perfect for my little toddlers fingers and they don't roll away, which is always a plus!. These are such a great priced item for the quantity and quality, I wouldn't care about any other complaints!"
5,GREAT CRAYONS!!!!,"I love these crayons! I have a 4 and a 2 year old and they go through crayons like crazy...til I found these. They are really tough and I love the package they come in, helps keep them together and not broken!! I have ordered two sets now and I recommend them to anyone!"
5,Pretty great crayons,"These are good crayons. The colors are bright and fun (much better than the Crayola sets of the same number-- these include metallics), they don't break quite as easily as regular crayons, they come in a pretty nice case. Would buy again. I saw a review that said these smell bad, but I sniffed them and they smell like crayons to me (imagine that!) and I'm pretty sensitive to smell."
5,These crayons are WONDERFUL!,"These crayons are perfect for my 3-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son. They seem to be the perfect size for their little hands. They don't break easily and don't roll around. The case makes it easy to clean them up and keep them neat. The color variety is good, and I'm pleased with the vibrancy of the colors. Since we have gotten these, my children want to color more often. I will keep these on their wish list, so hopefully we can keep them well-stocked! They are a little more pricey than regular crayons, but they are so much better."
1,Terrible crayons-Don't understand other reviews!,"I bought these crayons for my daughter based off of the very good reviews they received from other people. I honestly can't even begin to understand WHY people say such good things about crayons. They are NOT durable...maybe they are more durable then the thinnest Crayola crayon but certainly not the jumbo crayons. The color is so light and barely there, it's not fun for young children. The crayons feel weird and are not at all like the color of the actual crayon when the color is on paper. These are the worst crayons I think we've ever used and that includes cheap crayons you get at a restaurant for kids to color with. I usually love Melissa and Doug but I am HIGHLY disappointed with these crayons."
4,Not as good as the large ones,My daugther has the larger M&D crayons for school so I got these for her at home. She never breaks crayons but somehow managed to break one of these. You do get more colors this way but I recommend getting the larger size crayons if you are going to have a toddler using them. They do color just as good as crayola and are awesome crayons otherwise.
5,Great crayons,These crayons are really nice. You have to push kinda hard with some of the lighter colors to make them work but they are nice. Plus there are a lot of colors to chose from. And the case is really nice and takes a little effort to open so smaller kids cannot get into it alone...which is nice.
2,"Yup, They Break","These crayons are just ""OK"". I expected them to be a bit more durable based on my experience with the jumbo sized crayons but I was disappointed as immediately after opening the box for the first time, my 2 year old easily broke 2 of them."
4,Still Testing,"We have the M&D; big version ""pyramid"" crayons and my daughter has enjoyed them, so I ordered these to add to the color palette. The hardness is a pro 'cause then they do not break easily as regular crayons do when toddler/preschool pressure on the paper. The hardness is a con 'cause these don't work well on cheap grocery store coloring books. Infact M&D; crayons work best with decent paper on a hard surface.This more multi-color set certainly opens up a wider variety of hue which just expands her understanding of color. The crayons themselves were a bit smaller than I expected. First thing she did was break one, purposefully, with two hands. Immediately asked me to fix it, and was disappointed when I knew I could do nothing. :/ Since that first experiment though she's enjoyed them."
3,Okay crayons,"These are very pretty in the case, and have the advantage of not having paper wrappers to get shredded and left all over the place. The crayons are fairly hard and not very prone to breaking, but that also means that they don't mark very brilliantly. Also I don't love the selection of colors; there's a weird proliferation of olives and browns and not as many exciting near-primaries as I would expect. The triangular shape is nice for not allowing them to roll off the table. Overall, these are okay, but nothing to write home about.My toddler and I vastly prefer these: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005YWG5VM/ref=wms_ohs_product"
5,Una Mattina by Ludovico Einaudi,"Words cannot adequately describe the beauty I discovered upon listening to Una Mattina, by Italian composer and pianist Ludovico Einaudi. Ancora, the last piece on the album astounds me each time I listen to it. It reaches to the soul. I can't believe such beauty can exist in the world. Ludovico is a genius of high degree. I recommend this to all who appreciate beautiful music, especially the piano. Ludovico Einaudi is, in my opinion, the greatest music artist/composer on earth. You won't be disappointed if you buy his works."
3,"A lovely album, but...","... try as I might, when downloaded into iTunes Track 4 insists on appearing by itselfI just cannot seem to consolidate into one album!?Other than that - this is superb piano, very relaxing"
3,Nice For Background Listening,"As my title says, I prefer this album as background. Or music to go to sleep by.I consider this genre New Age or Very Light Classical. It's quite pretty and relaxing but has little depth. I would say if you like Philip Aaberg, George Winston, or Lori Line you will love this album. If you are a lover of ""Classical"", you will not find this satisfying.Don't let the negative tone of my review turn you off to it completely. I do like it playing on my computer when I do some websurfing or am housecleaning. Probably will use it during worktime as well. I don't think I'd buy any other of his albums - after listening to clips from them they all seem to blend into one. I find this a lot with New Age music."
4,Una Mattina by Ludovica Einaudi,"I discovered the talent of Ludovica Einaudi about 2 months ago, and became mesmerized by his piano playing. I'm not much into piano music in general, however, when I heard his piano playing, I became captivated, and decided I must have his music. I've listened to it over and over, and I never get tired of it. There's something almost ethereal behind his piano playing, unlike I've ever heard before in other piano classical music. His music is definitely worth your time to check into, you will not be disappointed."
1,Not what you hope for,Being a big fan on Ginger Lynn in the 80's I was pleased to see Ginger Hawaiian available on DVD. Somehow though all the sex was removed and it is mereley a strip tease dvd hardly worth an X or explicit rating. An R for partial nudity would be more appropriate since there is no sex. If you were hoping for classic footage of Ginger in action do not waste your money on this dvd offering.
5,God and Science?,"An ambitious task--putting together God, science, end times, and creation--but Cootsona pulls it off with choice quotes and clean writing. Definite recommendation."
3,good book although more self help than philosophy,"i have to admit i was a bit disapointed with this book,expecting more in depth analysis of happiness and its causes. Although a great self help book it is not much of philosophy. this of course having nothing against betrand russel one of the greatest minds of the century"
3,Time Impacts Read,"One wishes Russell were with us today to update this work. Seventy plus years takes its toll. Much of the book relies on examples that are no longer relevent such as a womans place in the home and the method and speed of life and communication. Still, as you repaint examples in your mind while reading - the book offers unintended opportunity to the reader. Fill in your own dots - change the color - but the room remains - Russell makes clear that we can control our own happiness."
4,A clear vision in a clear prose style.,"So often we reguard happiness as something that happens to us, independantly of our mental and physical habbits. In the ""Conquest Of Happiness"", Russell refutes this fallacy, and encourages his readers to consider pro-active measures to both eliminate unhappiness and to ensure our happiness by rationally considering his advice, without self-absorbation or muddled thinking.The advice is very practical in nature and very much addressed to the general reader. Given the age of the book however, (first published in 1929), the language can tend to be a little malestream at times.However, if the reader is willing to wave a bye-ball on this minor draw back, Russell's prose style still is capable of charming and entertaining his audience, rather like a good parent might humor a disruptive child. (He was after all a nobel praise winner, awarded for his book ""Marriage and Morals."")All in all, well worth the money and effort!"
4,Great For what I need,"Being a serious home improver and a former carpenter, this is a great tool for my periodic use. Boring up to 1"" holes in concrete for anchors, wire access etc is made easy with this tool. Not too useful for hammering, unless you're working on cinderblock or other softer masonry, but fine for cleaning up rough concrete surfaces. Good selection of SDS bits... and reasonably priced. If you're a home owner with periodic small scale concrete/block work, this'll do fine. For heavier work, I'd go with something a bit bigger"
4,Cool watch but as it has been said before...,"it is useless at night... unless you have a way to light it externally like a keychain light or a cellphone (though, if you have a cellphone then you don't need to worry about seeing the time from your watch in the first place)it's specially cool in december as the way it tells months is interesting and when you put it in month mode it looks like the imperial japan flag."
5,A Step Up With A Grand Mix Of Styles,"After the great acceptance of ""Young Americans"" (no surprise), Bowie once again reevaluated himself and mixed a little funk with some serious drama vocals. Sure, the lengthy title track has some nice special effects and a three-tiered bridge that keeps the momentum going, but there is so much more. Other than the finger snapping ""Golden Years"" and the techno-pop endlessly repeating chorus of ""TVC15"" (a slam on MTV), Bowie tries his voice at `high' vocal drama. Both ""Wild Is The Wind"" and the funkier, ""Stay"" show Bowie's remarkable vocal range. It's no wonder the RYKO additions were included. It's a satisfying combination and, once again, Bowie succeeds."
1,Arrived rusty,"I've ordered other Denali products,including 2 different style loppers and the wood borer kit which were very high quality and incredible bargains. If this tool wasn't so rusty, it would have been nice too. I didn't think aluminum rusted, so I wonder what it is really made of or had added to the aluminum. Anyway, I'm returning it and NOT asking for a replacement."
5,Great movie...,Even more so that Sam J. Jones is in it! Thanks for sending it in a timely fashion and it was packed very well. Thanks again. :o)
2,not dat good of a movie,"rhis move starrs sam jones (the flash). the act is not that good and the action is not that good. this is a mob movie where to familys make peace with each other until backstabbers destroy the pledge.dont rent it, it will peobably air on tv. sometime. wait until then. be patient"
2,"Hey, folks! The Hughes edition of Milton has been reprinted","Stop the complaining that the Hughes edition is out of print. It's back! (Yes, with its dated notes; but the table of contents and the editing more than make up for that.) Find it here.John Milton, Complete Poems and Major Prose$48.00 new. My version's 30+ years old and I still lovingly consult it."
2,1998 edition omits 3 lines of Paradise Lost,"There is a major error in the 1998 edition of this volume. Three lines of Book VIII of Paradise Lost are omitted due to a typesetting misprint. Just thought everyone should be apprised. The lines are in Book VIII, lines 533-535.Other than this glaring fault, I like this edition. It is not practical for class instruction, but it is thorough, though perhaps to a fault. 1/4 of the footnotes to Paradise Lost regard typographical variants of commas, periods, and semicolons. This would be useful information to a small subset of scholars."
3,This edition is inclusive but difficult to use,"This is a solid and inclusive edition of Miltons poetry with some useful introductory materials. It lacks a useful table of contents, however, and individual poems are hard to find. The weight and quality of the book suggest quality, but the layout wastes a lot of real estate without being particularly more readable. The notes are at times informative, but at others partisan and opinionated. I've tried hard to like this book, but reach for my 30 yr old Hughes edition when I need to get something done and want to enjoy it."
1,Disappointed,I bought these books thinking they were hardcover books and they are not. The are more like magazines. If I had known that I would never had bought them. In fact my daughter already has these books and I purchased them at a dollar store for .50 a piece. And when I tried to return them to amazon I found out I would have to pay for return shipping. Which I chose not to do. Because after paying for the return shipping I would not get much of a refund back. These are not coloring books but books about the dolls themselves and beauty tips. My daughter loves the set she has. I just think amazon should not advertise that these are hardback books when they are not.
4,Great toy for a three to four year old girl!,This game is great fun for my four year old daughter. It occupys her for a long time and it is fun to play along with her to!
2,Not worth buying,"i bought this for my 4 yr old daughter for christmas, it is a cute game and she liked it but after playing it 2 times the outfits wouldnt stick on the people anymore. so its a waste now it just sits there and theres not alot of outfits for the girl dolls mainly blue and boyish. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."
3,Very cute for girls!,I bought this toy to use with my students but was very disappointed to find that you can only dress up the girls. There are no boys to dress up. I ended up selling this toy to one of my clients who has 2 daughters. Hopefully this company can make an educational toy to be used with girls AND boys.
2,Pretty poor quality -- missing pieces,"I had high hopes for this, since I remembered these from when I was young. Unfortunately, we had to do some quick explaining at Christmas when we opened the package and there were no stickers! I ended up just throwing the game away."
3,Good toy for the price.,"I tried to find regular colorforms and couldn't. This is a good game for the money, but the clothes don't stick on very well. Although the pieces are colorful, cute and durable."
1,Not What They Used To Be,"These ColorForm toys today are just a nothing, they do not cling like the old ones when I was a kid, will never buy another one for my child, they are a piece of junk, I think they belong in a trashcan!!!"
3,good concept but....,"Bought this for my 2 and 3 year old children at Christmas. My daughter likes it better than her older brother.It's a game, but she just likes to dress up the cardboard figures.Personally, I hate the small colorform pieces. They tend to get lost very easily. The cardboard doll stands fell apart after 2 uses."
3,Doesn't live up to the expectation...,"While a great concept for a beginner game, this game does not live up to the Colorforms name. This was the second set I purchased, hoping the first failure was a fluke. The colorforms do not stick after playing with it only a couple of times. We have other colorforms that have lasted much longer...this game, however, does not. Disappointing."
3,Delta power feeder,The product was shipped promply and shipper corrected problems with machine. Delta needs to change their packaging design as the handles break during shipment. If they would just leave them off the machine and put them in the box with the other parts it might keep them from breaking. It performs well and was easy to install. Just a problem with broken handles which I was expecting due to other reviews of this product.
3,Good for occasional use.,I work in the woodworking industry and this would not cut it. It has performed well in my home shop though. My only complaint would be that it doesn't have enough torque. If you have to much downward pressure on your workpiece and you stop the feeder it may not start again without you pushing it. Good feed speeds and easy setup/installation.
5,Great Protein Option,"I try to stay away from milk derivatives so I don't use whey, soy has a lot of negatives associated with it and then bean based proteins that use peas, garbanzo or other beans can cause bloating and gas. This type of rice protein is easy to digest and doesn't have any other possible allergens such as soy, gluten, milk, egg, wheat, corn, and yeast.I'm fine drinking it with water, but it definitely tastes even better when I mix froze berries, baby spinach, banana and rice milk (yeah, I know rice milk with rice protein, but it works)."
3,"OK for the price, but have had better","I was using UNI KEY'S Fat Flush Body Protein but it is so expensive ($46. for 2 lb) that I was trying to find a replacement. This RICE PROTIEN is less expensive, but it doesn't mix into the liquid as well and the taste/texture overwhelms the juice and fruit I mix with it. I am going to go the extra $ and get the other so I can enjoy my smoothie again."
5,"Tastes great, fabulous price on Amazon- gets the job done",Have been using this for years...me likes! What more os there to say? :) Makes GREAT vegan smoothies & I genuinely LIKE the taste (kind of like cake batter) if you purchase vanilla...
4,Easy To use,"This quick release system is perfect for the Shure 55s series,makes it easy to turn the rigid retro microphone into a walk around mic."
3,Art of Coppersmothing,"The book is an interesting history of coppersmithing, but too much is relating to boring the apprentice. The style of the book is in the old English wording (late 1800's) which is a slow read for today. The needs of the day were well explained but don't relate well today. Most current artist keep their skills a secret, so you will be looking for more."
2,Written by the pilgrims,This is a book which may be of historical significance but is of little practical value today. It was originally published in 1894. Do not get this as some kind of how-to guide or you will be disappointed.
4,Subotai the Valiant,A good overview of Subotai and his military exploits. Great for someone who knows little about Subotai. I found it had good coverage of the battles in the Caucasus and Russia. Also good on the campaigns in China.
3,"A book, less about the man, more about the campaigns","When I purchased the book, I had hoped it would be more about the man behind many of the great Khan's successful campaigns. Gabriel provides plenty of insights in an easy-to-read novel about a master military tactician.I had hoped that the book would contain more information with regards to Subotai's character. What makes him tick? The introduction was good, which provided a history of young Subotai, and I certainly would like to have read more about his development."
1,Handle with care,"This book is poorly researched. Instead of taking the time to understand the key sources, the author makes use of low quality secondary sources combined with guess work and speculation. Sube'etei can be associated with more than 20 campaigns and more than 35 battles. The author deals only with a few of these and not even able to reconstruct these correctly. This book should be classed as fiction."
5,Spellbound,"There have been so many reissued versions of this album over the years, some with bonus tracks, that it gets confusing trying to keep up with what's in print and what isn't. But the bottom line remains: this is a flawless, fantastic, fun album. Surely a candidate for my favorite albums of all time. I've been listening to these songs for the past 30 years and they still sound fresh and exciting. Costello was on a roll when he recorded this collection of pop and soul masterpieces. Don't miss it!"
3,The beginning of the end really,"At first for a long time i did not buy it because it had the pseudo-damaged sleeve. OK I was dumb but maybe not so much. This was the period when Costello started to take himself way too seriously, and which unfortunately has not ended. What a great talent went wasted..."
1,Don't Get Happy,"This CD was recommended to me by someone who I thought was a person of good taste: I now know otherwise. I don't know what you have to do to sit through this entire record but I barely got through the first five tracks before I was fed up. All I heard were a bunch of shallow, lyrical cliches; trite, undeveloped, unexplored tunes that were too short to be anything but shallow; and an overall delivery that was less interested in being interesting than it was in fulfilling some unfathomable whim of Costello's . I started playing it with high hopes, and after the first song I said ""that's IT?"" I kept listening hoping it would get better, but it went nowhere. So there I was, stuck with a CD I couldn't return: it went in the trash. Lesson: ALWAYS, ALWAYS listen to a CD before you buy it."
1,Sometimes there's just nothing to get,"Sorry if I gave the impression that I'm some naive shmuck who can't enjoy anything more gritty and abrasive than Tesh at Red Rocks. ""Get Happy"" is R&B? Please. It's the most uninteresting music I've owned. It almost put me to sleep when I first listened to it, even though I had it up loud and I wasn't even tired to start with. Do people bring pillows and blankets to the concerts? And this isn't a fan club page. It's for anyone even remotely interested in Costello. I'm sorry if the True Fans feel their hero is maligned by my honest opinion which I have every right to give. I don't like any music that a zen master would have trouble focusing on. Maybe ""Get Happy"" was ""One for the Fans"", a little in joke. If so what *should* a newcomer listen to (I was told *this* was a good place to start)? Or is it just one of those things where some losers want to feel ""hip"", and implicitly agree to ""get"" something that isn't there? See review title."
1,Misleading description,Do not buy this copy of Get Happy! if you are expecting to get all of the songs listed above. The original album has 20 songs and so does this one. The extra 11 songs listed above are not on this version of the album. I returned the cd and bought another one.
3,Blues Creation - self-titled (Black Rose) 3 1/2 stars,"Originally released in 1969, as I was unable to find much info on this Japanese psych / heavy rock four piece. But,apparently they did put out several albums. Need to find more of their music. Tunes I was sort of impressed with were the catchy ""Checking Up On My Baby"",""Double Crossing Time"" and ""All Your Love"". Line-up:Fumio Fuya-vocals,Kazuo Takeda-guitar,Yoshi Yuki-bass and Shinichi-drums. Do check it out."
5,A Must Own DVD For Real Fats Domino Fans,"This is an absolutely wonderful Fats Domino concert!! So emotionally involved does one become as Fats sings one great hit after another, that it somes close to being at a live performance."
1,Biginning CorelDraw 8,I was disappointed on recieving the CD. And will have to return it. I can't find any mention unless there is a reviewer that states if it is PC or Mac and or PC/Mac. The difficulty of buying on line is that you can't read the fine print. PC or Mac friendly should be next to the title on all software presented.
5,Non-Sensational history of Knight Templars,"I've read several books on Knight Templars. This books provides an outstanding historical view into their lives and history. Many books claim them to posses mystical powers. This books explains some of the stories that are attributed to Templars, but with a clear explanations and without creating any sensations. A must have for anybody who is interested in Freemasonry and Knight Templars in general."
5,A Splendid Addition to a Research Library,"The Rise And Fall Of The Knights Templar by Gordon Napier is a meticulously researched, well written examination of the rise and fall of one of the world's most mysterious groups: The Poor Fellow Soldiers of Christ and the Temple of Solomon.Within the context of this work, Mr. Napier displays an impressive array of talents; his deft handling of the topic leads us through the knight's tragic story with both a scholar's passion for research, as well as an artist's flair for detail. So whether you are a serious student of Templar History, or just looking for a good, solid over-view of this topic, I recommend this book highly."
1,Below average read,"This was a highly anticipated purchase and read for me but I came away very displeased with Gordon Napiers book.Rather than go into any detail, Gordon Napier skipped from one subject to another before the reader could catch your breath. In other words, this book is nothing more than an overview with little detail and excessive use of puncuation. Quite honestly, I came away from this book knowing as little as I did when I started it.I rate this book 1 star and this is only for the cover art only and recommend that readers who wish to gain more knowledge try other authors with more skill and knowledge."
1,Never got it,"I would love to rate this book, but it has been delayed for 2 months now. Bad service, Amazon!"
1,If only I could read it!,Like others I have been waiting for months for this book to arrive. Where does Amazon get off saying it should arive in 10-14 days. Be honest Amazon.
4,Sweet!,"I dove right after this album after hearing 5 minutes of it on the radio. I wasn't disappointed. How sweet the sound. I'm not at all a harpsichord enthusiast - and, yes, the album has the general tone of one - but the guitar adds what was always missing from the early keyboards, warmth!Harpsichord always seems to me of a very mental energy. Probably makes it good to study to. Guitar, however, is for the Heart - even more so poised against these tinnier sonorities. The blend is superb. An even more perfect Bach![Remember ""Switched-on Bach"", the Swingle Singers, the authentic instrument movement.] I'm surprised that these [the #2 of this series included] are the only harpsichord/guitar recordings of Bach. Google.com didn't find one CD result to <Bach harpsichord guitar>.By the way, the only jangling cut for me on this album was the 1st."
5,Collected Tales of the American Indians,These tales are fanciful and magical and some are just bizarre. I have loved reading Barry Lopez's writings for many years and bought this book because I have read about Coyote in the books of Tony Hillerman and was curious to lean more of this Indian legend. This book is full of the stories of Coyote and gives a better understanding of his doings.I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Indian legends and who loves to read good stories.
4,"Hairball ""Roots""","Lopez heralds a message to our so-called ""modern"" Judeo-christian culture from the stone-age past: You can't separate the good from the bad. Coyote resembles nothing short of an agent of Bacchus, welding god-like powers of creation, with basal human desires and weaknesses.In his anthology, Lopez has focused strictly on the Coyote of Native American lore, and thus has attempted to filter out most of the more modern interpretations and spin-offs, as well as removing any european influences. The observation that Lopez was not entirely successful in this effort shows the difficulty of such a task. The last story, ""Coyote Finishes His Work"", shows a distinctly ""Euro-christian"" influence. However, Lopez was at least successful enough to distinguish this piece from Bright's ""Coyote Reader"". Both are excellent works, and deserve your eye."
4,"He Deserves More Popularity, a lot More","Not all take delight on the conductor Kurt Masor but the orchestra itself is gorgeous. This violinist is comparatively young who looked to be in his mid-thirties. I first came across him right after I've heard Heifetz. Interestingly this violinist's hand/fingers resemble that of Heifetz, albeit it that his are slightly larger. Of course, he has less drama and less facility than Heifetz. But he didn't come out too badly in comparison. He reminds me more of Zimmermann who is of about the same age, and one couldn't really say who is better. But then the latter is so popular now. He also reminds me of Suk who shares his fate by not having the due recognition of the American market. Broadly speaking, his approach is more classical than romantic and he is just graceful on the stage, quite a contrast to Gidon who hops and gasps on the stage. The recording is very good but it's nothing like a DG. Recommended."
1,could have been said in half the amount of pages,The material is first-rate but his writing style is horrid. His five-part typology of memory doesn't make sense since he is basically repeating the same theme for each type of memory in each chapter. The underlying theme is about the destruction and shattering of the self. Very poorly written and bad organizatino of his material. There are much better and clearer books on the Holocaust! Don't bother with this one!
3,Big price jump for set number 5,I hope the price comes down on this set. The other sets are priced well below this one on a per disc basis.
2,Not for parrot people,This may be a good guide for people who raise chickens or pigeons. It's not helpful at all for folks wanting an outdoor aviary for their exotic birds. The book does not stress safety or bird-safe materials.
4,"Good ""How To"" Book","This is a good book. It is not for the person who has never built anything though. Fortunately my roommate is a real handy dandy person and can decipher these how to books quite easily. I don't know what half the tools are. So if you plan to use it to build cages or an aviary, you better know something about building things to start with, or have a good friend who does."
1,Shoddy cages - NO aviaries...,"Bad information,shoddy cages and NO aviaries sums up this print.It saddens me if the author really is a volume breeder of pet birds raised in such crappy environments.Small cages made from wood are impossible to sanitize properly and thereby guaranteed to be a breeding ground for mite,lice,mold and more.Cutting corners to make a couple bucks on behalf of the animals' welfare is not where I hoped aviculture in America to be today.There's no help in this book for those who look for help or hints to build a backyard aviary to provide their companion bird(s) with fresh air,sunshine and rain in an enclosure built to allow flight - the way pet birds ->should be kept."
5,Its a light bulb,Its a light bulb what do you want me to say about it. I need it for my light fixture to work and ordering online saves the hassle of having to go to different stores to track one down.
4,Different Twist,"As a prolific reader of fiction, I'm always looking for that new twist. Using the PGA Tour as the back drop got me hooked (pun intended) on Corrigan's Jack Austin series. I liked his first book but this one is better. I suspect that Corrigan is going to be around for awhile."
5,An addictive read,"When I started this book, I could not put it down. The characters and story line got me hooked and I couldn't wait to see what happened in the end. This is an enjoyable book for mystery lovers and golf addicts alike."
1,Not the best read,"Not a good read. hard to follow, unrealistic (even for a fictional mystery), poor story line. Not what I was looking for."
4,Sisters enjoy the Castle Pounder,"My one year old got this toy for her birthday, and it is her favorite of the gifts. Her almost 3 year old sister also loves it. Though it does make for some tense moments when they both want to play with it (""Watch out for your sister's fingers!! Please use the hammer carefully.""), it is also nice to see them learning to play cooperatively. The younger one will load the balls on the castle turrets, while the older one will hammer away. Lots of silliness and laughter. A good buy."
3,castle capers,mytwo year old twins love this toy. however as a parent it can be noisy at times. they also fight over who will use the hammer and it can be dangerous when they are hammering the ball into the holes
5,Perfect Punk for Now (and then) People,"When this album burst forth, the New York Dolls seemed a distant memory (even though their demise came only a few years earlier), but David Johansen scraped off his makeup, slipped on a pair of sensible shoes, and proceeded to rock.It's a pity his back catalogue is in such disarray; this album (along with ""In Style"") are Rock 'n' Roll masterpieces.Will someone out there remaster these CDs already? We're waiting!In the meantime, check out the New York Dolls NEW album (how exciting is it to say that?) ""One Day It Will Please Us To Remember Even This.""The story continues...Ed Kaz"
4,Soothing Songs,This is a very soothing collection. Wonderful for the newborn months and long after--I use it now for the perfect backdrop for my toddler when we are getting ready for bed at night. A great gift for others too!
2,"The book is great, but what's up with her voice?","This could serve a purpose for those who don't read music to learn the tunes. The singer sounds OK on some songs, but her renditions of ""All the Pretty Little Horses"" and ""Rock-a-bye Baby"" were horribly sung. The book has beautiful images and is a real keepsake. If you are looking for a fabulous voice with great emotional feeling in it, get someone's grandma to sing from the book."
4,Good way to protect your Wii...but,"This is a great way to protect your Wii, if you can get everything to fit. We decided to purchase this case after buying the same brand and style for the PS3.The Wii fits VERY snugly in the case, so much so that it's a little tricky to get it out of the case (we had to add a strap around the Wii to make it easier). Also, you have to try different configurations to get everything to fit (2 Wii-motes, motion bar etc)and get the case closed.Over all it makes transporting the Wii very easy."
2,Too small,"It's very durable, but by the time you start packing the case with additional controllers or the power brick, there is no room and it kind of defeats the purpose of purchasing the product."
4,Good Case but...,This is a good case.Pros:Sturdy and heavy dutyLight weightGood value for the priceCons:Wii Console and accesories are a very very tight fitNot much room for anything eles but console and a few remotesOverall:It does what it says
5,"Solid, Strong, Well Made Case","This case works fine for transporting your precious Wii. It does not hold very many games (maybe 6), but the accessories all fit in nicely, and everything fits tight, so it won't be jostling around in transit. Okay, the foam did indeed smell a little funny, but not like what others have described. The smell is all but gone after a couple of weeks. Regardless of odor, this is some of the best form fit foam that I've seen. It looks like it will hold it's shape and not tear or get squishy, like other foam liners I've had."
1,VERY Disappointing,"I bought this case for my son for Christmas. He used it once successfully-- it seemed like a great solve for safely carrying his expensive new toy. The second time he went to pack up his Wii, the case broke! The hinges broke when he opened the case with a little too much speed. The weight of the lid was too much for the little molded plastic hinges. The design is such that here is no way to fix or replace them, and no way to use the case without the Wii falling out. We were both soooo disappointed. Next time I'm going for the padded messenger-bag style."
3,Not big enough,"This case is good for carrying the basics (i.e. cords, tower, a few games, and only two remotes w/out the covers). I have to carry either the cords or nunchucks in a different bag. But I do feel good knowing the sensor bar and tower are safe and snug."
3,"Great on the outside, tight in the inside","When I was looking for a case for my new nintendo wii, I went through a lot of styles. Finally, I bought this one because it is hard and tough on the outside, but when I got it and started storing my videogame inside to go out with it, I found it tight to fight in all my games (8) and my 2 wiimotes and nunchucks, cables, etc. I have found a new way to arrange things inside it, but I still think it is small if you have a lot of accesories. And other thing, it has no lock, as it shows in the picture. That was also a nono. :( Overall, a great product, and service.Thanks, hope you enjoy your case once you get it. !"
4,Great for traveling Wiis,"We were taking our Wii everytime we went over to friend's houses in a backpack which doesn't provide enough protection. My husband wanted to buy a backpack specifically made for the Wii, but I wanted something that could take a beating and still keep everything safe inside.This case is perfect for a traveling Wii. The console, controllers, games and wires have their own little compartment. Even the sensor bar has a specific spot where it is strapped in safely out of harms way. The case is strong and sturdy, yet light. A few drawbacks: 1) You have to remove the batteries since the controllers bump into each other and drains the battery quickly. 2) Not enough room for a lot of games to be stored. I had a hard time closing the box b/c I was trying to pack in 5 games. 3) No room for my nunchucks since the wires takes up a lot of space and I always feel like I'm jamming them in. Overall, this case is worth the awesome price."
4,Wii Pro Gamer's Case,"It's a tight fit, but securely holds my son's Wii system and a couple of games."
4,Nice listening,I bought this CD because my son is learning to play Spanish Dance on the violin. The other tracks are nice to listen to too.
5,The dark side of Copper Blue,"I've always thought of this as a companion piece to Copper Blue - same type of thing, but a whole lot angrier. Noisy, but still melodic. Buy it and play it loud."
5,Pain,"Ethereal, spiritual, brutal. Bob Mould leads the band through the tunnels of religious struggle with this visciously visceral mini-album. Sugar's finest moment, but barely heard (probably a result of Mould's shrewd marketing sense, knowing that the band was widely considered a power-pop group), it is a true Bob Mould album of grit and ugliness. The band is at its musical zenith here: the guitars are just dirty, Malcolm's drumming moves beyond the often plain patterns on ""Copper Blue"" and ""F.U.E.L.,"" and Dave's bass-playing is just sprawling all over the album. The record opens and closes with heavenly songs of acceptance (the opener willingly, and the closer more out of necessity/hopelessness). But it's what's in between that's really interesting: angry and confused, as dislplayed in ""Tilted,"" perhaps the band's best song overall (but that's a close one) and ""JC Auto."" Sugar's finest moment."
4,"If you can get this, do so.","If only, of course, you are a stout anime fan or a big fan of Evangelion. The RPG plays out pretty well, if only a few nuances that need to be first learned."
5,Great HDTV decoder for the price.,"I live in an apartment complex and the dish for my DBS is right between two buildings on the first floor firing over the building next door. With just a little Terk42 10db Omni directional attached to my dish I get all the local OTA HDTV broadcasts.The HDTV 480p, upconverted 720p are great and the 1080i is fantastic.This STB has some limitations but I can accept them, for what it does well, is fantasic."
2,Not the right one to get for most users,"Unless you have industrial-type 5"" dust collector lines, get the Model 50-355, also sold here, instead. In spite of what it says on the 50-355 page, it works fine for both left-tilt and right-tilt Unisaws. The 4"" port on the 50-355 is also the standard size for home shop dust collection systems."
3,Dust Collector Review,"Overpriced in light of what you get (or don't get). They need to include the 5"" to 4"" adaptor (to get it down to the size most people use) and the correct screws to atach it. Otherwise it works fine. It keeps the dust to a minimum. I purchased a standard 5"" to 4"" heating vent adaptor at Home Depot and pop riveted it on so it would stay put. Extra cost and work that should not have happened if Delta had designed it correctly in the first place."
4,Phenomenal perphormance,"4 1/2One of the greatest live recordings I've yet had the privilege of hearing, this is widely regarded as one of the greatest jam band's greatest shows- ergo, one of the most vital electric, high-resolution recordings of the last thirty years. Forget about all the amazing things they do to make this holy even to the obsessed, I am preaching outside of the choir on this one."
5,Amazing,"Recently, I have been getting more into Phish. I have a few of the studio albums, a few Live Phish CD's, Hampton Comes Alive, A Live One, and this New Year's Eve show.This show is incredible. The songs that stand out the most to me are Chalk Dust Torture, The Lizards, Collective Soul's ""Shine"" (which features Tom Marshall, who wrote many Phish lyrics), and The Lizards. The jams on almost every song are incredible. This is far better than Hampton Comes Alive and (the practically flawless) A Live One. Buy this show. It's worth it."
4,Worth The Hype...Trey's Voice A Little Shot...,"If you saw these guys a lot between 1993 and 1995 like I did, this is an essential addition to your collection. Late 1995 is when all of the steam they had been building for the previous few years finally came to a head. 12/31/95 (along with 10/21/95 from the Live Phish series) has all of the quirkiness and intensity that won over so many fans on full display. One star deducted for Trey's voice, which is a little rough throughout the show."
5,best of the best,"I own all the live phish cds and all the live download archives, and this stands at the top of them all. I agree with most opinions that the live phish series generally lacked in sound quality, but not this release at all. They did their best live remastering job by far on this album, which makes sense with the quality of this show. It took me two weeks before I could even stop listening to and move on from the first set. The Reba and Squirming Coil Jams are worth the price of admission alone on this set, then throw in a 16 minute jaw dropping runaway jim on disc 2...and forget about it. This show defines live phish for me, all phans know they love it, and if you are new to Phish, this is the one you want to check out."
5,One of the best shows ever,Just got this for Christmas and haven't stopped listening to it for 3 days. Better than Hampton comes alive at almost a third of the price. Trey proposes the question what if we were forever stuck in 1994 as the band begins playing Shine by Collective Soul... need I say more?
2,As overrated as it gets.,"The last 6 minutes of a 25 minute long ""You Enjoy Myself"" - so loved by Phisheads that it's been nicknamed YEM - are 6 minutes of my life that I will never get back. They're almost as bad as Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music.If you want to listen to what *can* be done with 20+ minute tracks of live rock, please turn to Built to Spill's Cortez the Killer, or to any old Allman Brothers.And as for the rest of the album? It's mostly just boring.If you're not committed already to loving Phish - be warned and stay away."
1,will really only fit into a vehicle with mounting points that are spread apart perfeectly.,I bought this to a 2009 Highlander and found out that I could not adjust the straps small enough for the width of my vehicle. so I decided to zip tie it in so the straps were tight accross the vehicle. BUT due to the mounting points being too close together the poles are not held up at all and i may as well have just put them in the back with the rod tips hitting the roof on the way towards the front seats. It did come with custom mounting points that can be installed in you attic garage or otherwise used in an old vehicle to add correctly spaced mounting points. I would not recomend this product to anyone unless you have an old vehicle you are willing to drill mounting points into the vehicle.
3,fishing season,"Seem ok less than expected but usable. little difficult to put in car, but that could be me [65 years old]."
2,Great for lightweight tackle or weekenders.,"This item was too wide for my 1996 Ford Explorer and had to be cut and modified to fit. I can tell that after a season or 2 it will need replacement, probably because i have medium to heavy tackle and use it year round. It is well suited for a larger vehicle, and i suggest you leave the heavier setups resting on the seats. I hope this review helps. Now i know why there are lots of luggage rack units around my area in use."
1,Too Big!!!,This is good if you are on the ocean. This strap is very large and cumbersome. It would be a nice fit for the coast guard!!
2,Don't waste your money,"I went to a recent concert of MZ and the Hardways. It was okay. Not great, but okay. So I purchased the album. Three words for you: overproduced, pretentious and schlocky. Another pseudo-rocker who is counting on his good looks to go somewhere. Chris Isaac of the 21st Century. An average band, an average song writer. If you have $15 extra bucks, spend it somewhere else. After listening to this album a couple times, it's likely to end up on the shelf, collecting dust and remaining unlistened to. The fate that it rightfully deserves."
3,"Not my first choice for these great works, but still adequate at low $$","I thought the sound quality of this recording was acceptable, but the playing was a little too ""safe."" Concerto Elegiaco was composed for Julian Bream, and his recording has Leo Brouwer conducting the RCA Victor Chamber Orchestra. In spite of it's lower audio quality and live performance flubs (which kind of make it even more appealing to me), the sensitivity of the Bream preformance is much more enlightening to me. Concerto de Toronto was composed for John Williams. This Ricardo Cobo cd is okay if you can pick it up for $5-7. Otherwise, get the Bream and Williams editions if anything for the authenticity. Oh yeah, I almost forgot: the cover art for this cd is lame."
5,"pencil,,perfect","i like the pencil just fine. no need to spend a dine more than thing.i would think twice before buying from who i got it from,,they sent me a bent one in a paper envelope. even myn kid wouldnt try to send anything semi fragile in a paper envelope.he would get a box.anyways,; they sent me another one,a month later. and i got to keep the bent one,.,yeeeayyyywould i buy again,, yes(the product)R"
5,A Tribute to Ricky Nelson,"Excellent is all I can say about this DVD. I had it on VHS but the DVD version is so clear and the sound is super. Much better then the VHS version.What a shame the kids of today do not have someone like Ricky to look up too. He, as well as the whole Nelson family, brought my family and I so many years of laughter.If you are a fan of Ricky Nelson, this DVD is for you. It's highly recommended! And someday I hope there will be other high quality DVD's available of Ozzie, Harriet, David and Rick."
5,Good for all stages of cooks,"I'm a soon to be chef (I hope) and in school we used this book. Let me tell you, its good. I has lots of good recipies and color pictures. The best thing about it, is that is shows how and why you do things. I think that is very good for someone to know. One thing that might be a bad thing is that it is a text book with questions at the end of a chapter and things like that."
4,Excellent Resource,"I'm currently a culinary school student and this is my text book. I find the instructions to be informative and the sections on recognizing foods, grading foods and storing foods to be exceptional. The explanation of techniques is informative and cumulative; the techniques used in later chapters build on earlier ones. There are hundreds of classic recipes which help you exercise technique. My main complaint is the lack of a measurement standardization. Dry goods can be measured in weight or volume, sometimes in the same recipe! Some of the recipes occasionally need a taste ""pick-me-up"". Still, its an excellent reference and I would recommend it to any serious home chef or would-be professional."
5,On Cooking has become the first book I reach for these days.,"I have found this book to be a great resourse for anyone who loves to cook. It answers any and all questions regarding techniques and fundementals of cooking. I am a student at the Culinary Arts Institute at Mississippi University for Women where Chef Labensky is on staff. I have had the opportunity to take a class with her and it was like having a chapter of her book come to life. This book not only relates techniques but tells the hows and whys of food. I feel this book is a wonderful addition to the library of anyone who loves to cook or who just loves food. Sarah, Thanks for sharing your knowledge."
4,best book for the new chefs,one of the best books for new chefs or people that just whant to try and cook somthing then the norm easy to follow recipes
5,"Read this book, possums!","I've been a fan of Dame Edna's for years and I have to say that this faux autobiography is one of the funniest books I have ever read. Starting from her humble beginnings (with mauve hair even then) we see our lovely Edna blossom into womanhood, marriage and motherhood---though she rarely has time to properly look after the kids because of her hectic and famous life. As an advisor to the rich, famous and royal (a spin doctor, in her words, to the Queen), Edna becomes a superstar in her own right---struggling with her troublesome childhood friend, Madge Allsop, who Edna lets us know, is a burden a good deal of the time! Edna deals with many dramas----her eccentric children, her husband with his desperate prostrate problem and the trials of being so easily recognizable to the general public. If you wanna read a book with a great deal of laughs, try to find a copy of this book. You won't be disappointed."
3,"""Acts of the Apostles: A Socio-Rhetorical Commentary""","To understand this book you need to know alot about the New Testament, and you need to be able to understand theological principal's."
3,only tried three so far,and I thought the quantities included in the recipe were off and they were. I have found two others where there were missing ingredients and wrong amounts. Cotton Country (Monroe Jr. League) is better book in my opinion.
4,Collection of Southern Delights,"Received this as a gift, and enjoy searching these for those outstanding, unique recipes you'd never find in other sources.There are some good ones in here, besides all the collection of basic, good food with southern emphasis. Finds include: Collection of recipes from former Miss Mississippi, Hostess Twinkie Dessert,Shrimp-stuffed Catfish, Bass and Artichoke Supreme, Oysters Bienville, and Fruit Tea."
5,A compact and Accessible Introduction to Infinite Group Theory,"Kaplansky explicitly states in the forward that this book is not so much aimed at those wanting to learn about infinite abelian groups, but rather at those wanting to learn about infinite algebra. While this book is certainly a superb introduction to the theory of infinite abelian groups, it does a better job of teaching familiarity with the methods of proof commonly used in more advanced mathematics. As such, the book is extremely accessible, requiring only the absolute basics of group theory. On the other hand, it does require a certain level of ""mathematical maturity,"" the ability to learn with a minimum of motivation and fill in gaps in proofs. For the specialist looking for a reference on infinite abelian groups, I would recommend both volumes of Laszlo Fuchs'Infinite Abelian Groups, Volume 1, Volume 36-I (Pure and Applied Mathematics), which is aimed more at the professional mathematician than the amature."
5,KEEP YOUR YOUNG MINDS ON EDUCATION.,THIS ALBUM WAS THE GREATEST I'VE HEARD SINCE THE JACKSON FIVES. KEEP THESE LYRICS ON EDUCATION AN THESE KIDS WILL BE IN THE HALL OF FAME BEFORE YOU KNOW IT. GOD BLESS EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU.
1,Awful,"This tape is primarily in English. The English is dreadful to listen to -- an English-speaking narrator trying to speak English with an distracting ""fakey"" French accent. This tape will not further your child's understanding of the French language, nor is it a good choice to start with. We purchased Volume II at the same time as Volume I. Both volumes are as equally bad."
2,Bonjour les amis,very repetitive; lacks the animation for child interest; songs are very drawn out; could be better.
1,Don't buy this video,This has to be the WORST foreign language video on the market. It is incredibly slow and WAY too repetitive. It also switches from condescending english instructions to poorly pronounced french. It's ironic that a french instructional video has 3 times the amount of English in it than french. It didn't even hold my 2 year olds intrest (and that's hard to do in the cartoon format). I can't see how anyone could learn anything from this video. Save your money.
1,"Pathetic, boring, ugly","This video feels very outdated, with it's primitive, ugly and slow animations. It also has a very boring teaching approach, where English is everywhere and the story is really weak. Children will get bored in an instant. Please don't waste your money. Your kids won't learn much from this video, simply because they'll walk away in minutes!"
4,HOT MOMMA? YEA!,"David Johansen, definitely delivers in this fun rock work out. It has a lot of moments similiar to the wrecklessness of his music w/the dolls. It doesn't quite compare to his debut, (wich sounds like it could have been the dolls third lost album, and is a must have to any music collector), but that hard rocking punk touch is still prominent. ""In Style"" is ironcially in-style, excuse the punn-s, (I like a touch of alias in my reviews). Sorry to digress, but as I was saying this album is off the wall in dizzying rocky dities-a must selection.also recommended: the Jam, X, Mott the Hoople, T. Rex, the Music Machine, the Shadows of Knight, the Standells,"
4,Stellar Stuff!,"In Style is a fine continuation of what David Jo started with his self-titled debut....same brilliant band, some great rock & roll songs (She, Wreckless Crazy) and a bit more of a soul direction (title track is the best example). Flamingo Road is a brilliant album-ender (the xtra version of Swaheto Woman is a bonus track). If you love his 1st one, move right on over to this one."
5,Still fresh comedy after 38 years,"Jackie Gleason is great in this movie. He play a troubled man who has no idea how to be a good father. But when he finally trys to do it, he goes to far. The result must be seen to be believed!"
5,Another must see.,"This is an excellent old movie and is a must see for the family . It is funny, has it's sweet moments and then will also bring tears to your eyes."
1,The Right Storage is the Wrong Book,"The photos in this book are only so-so. There are some interesting tips for making your own storage containers, but their so called ""clever"" storage solutions are not very clever. This book seems outdated. A better book is Simple Solutions Storage Space by Cahill."
5,Elvis' Seminal Work,"I've been an Elvis fan since Day One, no matter what format he decided to take. I pull out Elvis once a day at minimum, but if I were asked to take only one of his works with me, I wouldn't hesitate to name Blood & Chocolate.Here's a clue how much I enjoy it, my 38 yr old (as of 2007) Golden Crown Amazon parrot can sing every word of this album. Alice's favorite artists are Elvis, Jimi and INXS. But she only sings the words to the songs of Blood & Chocolate. Otherwise she's the opera diva with a loud voice, but no words.I can't place my finger on what exactly it is about this album that hits me so, but it might be the deep lyrics and their meaning. Or it just might be that it's a great beat to belt out as you paint your blue chair."
2,OVERRATED!,This session was an experiment in both songwriting and engineering. The cuts 'Blood and Chocolate' and 'Uncomplicated' are the only songs with the EC's customary tightness and energy. They're both GREAT EC&A. Everything else sounds tired and insincere. EC's most overrated recording.
2,Elvis' most overrated album,"I love E.C., I love the Attractions, I love Nick Lowe, so I was SO excited when this came out, as it was so hot on the heels of King of America. I was actually disappointed with King of America (it has improved with age, like a fine wine), so I saw this as an obvious attempt to return to the fantastic form of his pre-Punch the Clock days. As I listened, I was so let down. I thought this album was a noisy mess with weak songs. As time passed, I thought perhaps I'd been subverted by my own high expectations, so I bought the Ryko reissue and gave it another chance. Well, my opinion hasn't changed. It's still a struggle to listen to this album, possibly even more so as my ears have aged and the mid-range heavy production grates more than ever. I hate to say it, but I'd rather listen to Goodbye Cruel World than this album."
1,I thought I already had it,"Great album... but I've already paid twice for it: when it came out and when it got reissued with a first set of unreleased songs. I thought I wouldn't have to pay for songs I already paid for (isn't all that copyright saga just about it?)So Elvis, I hope you won't mind if I use Audiogalaxy this time."
2,One of his worst,"Not sure I can recall even one memorable song from this album. I bought it when it was new and listened to it 10-12 times. I've been a big Elvis C fan for years. Love Armed Forces, Imperial Bedroom, This Year's Model, even All this Useless Beauty is much better than this one. It just doesn't hold up."
4,Must read,i had to read this for my class then do my final paper on it i end up liking the book its a great read educational and interesting
3,Informative and humorous,"I found Ms. Nelson's book to be very informative, disturbing and humorous. I believe Ms. Nelson walked into the Washington Post with a lot of preconceived notions. She did not know she was entering a ""man-made"" jungle, and in the jungle one becomes a predator, prey or a skilled survivor. In the end she became a skilled survivor and not a ""Washington Wildebeest"". I am glad that she found her way back home, and she did not permanently damage her health, sanity or her outlook on life. God bless you Ms. Nelson!"
5,Nearly 10 years later and Nelson's words still ring true....,"Volunteer Slavery is STILL the book! Family, friends and coworkers are probably sick and tired of hearing me raving about the revealing, blistering and gossipy tell-all memoir! It's been nearly 10 years since the book was published, but I still regularly reread certain passages when I need inspiration, a good laugh, or a clearer understanding of the journalistic imbroglio with which I frequently have to deal with--after more than 15 years in the business!! Celebrate the anniversary of the BEST book EVER written about what it's REALLY like being a black journalist on the plantation...the newsroom at a daily newspaper!!"
5,A stunning visual display.,Contemporary Native American culture is revealed by a photojournalist who spent over 20 years exploring the Southwest region. Enjoy a stunning visual display which packs in contemporary photos of modern tribes and peoples: a blend of cultural history and art book. -Reviewer's Bookwatch.
2,as authentic as a plastic souvenir,"I bought this CD because I wanted to listen to Zulu voices, and the blurb on the back claims this is ""one of the most authentic ethnic performances every produced."" Perhaps I neglected the line that said ""Additional music written by George Raphael,"" because the Zulu singing is degraded by electronic accompaniment. This is about as ethnically authentic as a plastic trinket you buy in Disneyland. The original singing sounds good, but you can barely hear it under the muck of the `additional music."" Really too bad. If you want to hear Zulu voices, I suggest you look elsewhere."
2,Dado insert doesn't fit,"I purchased the insert with certainty from both Amazon.com and Delta that this is the right insert for my saw. There is only one problem, it is too large to fit in the saw. It is approximately 1/4"" too long. In comparing it with the insert that came with the saw it is visibly larger. The only solution appears to be to grind it down as other reviewers have noted on the insert for the 8"" Dado sets. While it can be done, it is disappointing for something that should simply drop in."
4,Really Good,"This Book is Fantastic. I know some people may have been dissapointed that it didnt mention as many Fantasy artists, but for that, you need to buy the ""Spectrum"" fantasy books. This book is Fantastic BECAUSE It took a few of the many great artists, and let them tell about themselves and how they made it to where they are and what theyve done, as well as some sketches and behind the masterpiece work. There was a wide variety of both fantasy and science fiction, paint, drawing and digital. Great for detail. But if you want an overview of MANY artists, its not what youre looking for, (as I said). The color and layout of the book is done well. Great book to have, especially if you're an aspiring fantasy artist."
3,"""Fantasy Art Masters"" Great for Fantasy Art Fans","""Fantasy Art Masters"" has a lot of different media and a wide variety of fantasy art methods. This book has everything from futuristic, sci-fi art to The Hobbit. Some are a little over the top. The color is fantastic as is the quality. The style of writing leaves a little to be desired, though."
3,"More ""Okay"" Than ""Wonderful""","""Fantasy Art Masters"" is something of a misrepresentation. Sure, I'll accept Alan Lee as a ""master"", but Gambino or Stone or Maitz? Hardly. There is some excellent art printed throughout the book, but there are also an equal number of works that could best be described as unintentional kitsch, starting with the cover. And if this book is meant to represent fantasy artists ""worldwide"" (with less than a dozen contributors, all from the U.S. or England), where are the creators from Japan or Germany or Spain? ""Shadowfire"" may dis the ""Spectrum"" books for reasons known only to him/herself, but ""Spectrum"" certainly features a much wider selection AND larger quantity of EXCELLENT art than can be found in ""Fantasy Art Masters."""
2,Disappointing,"I was pretty excited when I saw this book, but it was quite a let down when I received it. Over half of the book deals with science-fiction instead of fantasy and it also includes lots of computer made art. The best artists of the fantasy art world were left out. There are some interesting pieces in this book, but it was not really what I was hoping for."
3,interesting,"the painted art side of this book is classic fantasy art - the I.T. based creations are dated , but nevertheless interesting .... made me decide to take a course in I.t. art .The text , though , despite being detailed and full of information , is the usual dancing to architecture ; you can either draw or you can't , and no book can change that ."
5,excellent,A must read for all serious Christians! Steve Smallman does a wonderful job explaining the call and spiritual walk of a christian.
2,so dumb and boring couldnt finish,It sounds like horror fun but it is just a sleepy mess. Bad actors silly storyline. It really is like a high school film project someone did. And got a B. That's good for high school but theater wise that's a C!
5,Gritty Underground Film,"Reminiscent of 1960s/1970s exploitation films, ""Tied Up"" has everything you want in an underground film: lesbians, drugs, rape, masturbation, boobs, torture, and murder. How can you go wrong?"
2,Not really all that useful...,"... if you have more then two remotes and/or nunchuks. This simply doesn't have a place to store more then two remotes and two nunchuks. Here is the breakdown in pros and cons.Pros:It does help control clutter by keeping remotes and nunchuks nicely organized.Has dedicated storage for SD and GameCube memory cards.Is made of high quality plastic/plastic polymer SIMILAR to the Wii, so it matches nicely.Cons:It doesn't help control clutter if you have more then two remotes and/or two nunchuks (or any classic controllers). I would prefer to have four areas to store remotes and get rid of the storage for SD and GameCube memory cards.Kinda unnecessary sense the Wii already comes with a vertical stand. So all you are really buying is a place to hold two remotes and two nunchuks... so in my opinion, not really worth the money.It works, but I just don't think it's worth spending the $30-$40 for something that only holds two remotes and nunchuks."
3,Good for 2 controller people.,"If you have more then 2 controllers, I would suggest getting a different stand, but it does very well if you only have 2. The cords are an issue, and you have to remove the nuchuck from the remote to put them in the stand."
4,nice stand for the Wii,is nice for the gamecube..but i give 4 starts coz the wii doesnt have god ventilation and the wiimote dont fit well...so... is almost ok...
1,NO MORE COMPILATIONS PLEASE !!!!!!!!!!,"THESE GUYS HAVE THE MOODY BLUES DISEASE- YOU KNOW THE ONE THAT MAKES YOU RELEASE TONS OF COMPILATION ALBUMS...TOUR ENDLESSLY FOR NO APPARENT REASON OTHER THAN TO ""SURVIVE ANOTHER YEAR""...TOUR WITH SYMPHONY ORCHESTRAS TO DO WATERED DOWN VERSIONS OF THEIR SONGS....ENOUGH ALREADY...HAVE YOU GUYS RUN OUT OF IDEAS????? USED TO BE MY FAVORITE BAND....END OF AN ERA...STAY TUNED FOR KANSAS GREATEST HITS LIMITED EDITION TAPED AT THE COUNTY FAIR!!!!"
4,Kansas... Sail On 30th Anniversary Collection 1974-2004,"The reason I didn't give this collection 5 stars is because I'm not to crazy about the Kansas years without Steve Walsh but other then that this is by far one of the best Anniversary Collections ever put out in my opinion... The mastering is excellent & the highlight of this set is the DVD, you get vintage Kansas doing live versions of their songs... plus video's that haven't been seen in years... I recommend this Anniversary Collection to any Kansas fan out there... This is excellent... Definitely worth getting!"
5,Great Collection of Kansas,"This was a gift for my husband's birthday and he was totally surprised. The music contained in this collection is awesome along with the DVD of performances. He listens to it all the time and he already knew the words to all the songs as he is an AVID Kansas fan, and this collection just topped off his collection. It is well worth the money."
4,Qui!,I found this very helpful in our trip. I used it as a companion piece to things friends had told me about. The photos were great.
2,For Completists Only,"I love country music -- the real stuff -- the kind Elvis attempts here. I also love Elvis Costello; for the past week, I have listened incessantly to his collaboration with Burt Bacharach, ""Painted From Memory.""*So with that as a perspective, I have to say that this may be the weakest effort in the entire Elvis catalog. Getting Billy Sherrill in Nashville surely was the right thing to do, but these songs don't click, and about none of these covers can stand along side the original. I can't specifically carp about the playing or the vocals, but where they fail is in capturing the heart, the spirit, the feel of country music. They sound too much like an experiment. Years later, Van Morrison, another giant, would fail in a similar effort.*For sure, this is not a ""bad"" album, but there are 20 better collections that Elvis has recorded and thousands of better country albums."
4,SOLID ALBUM,"Costello's country excursion works well because of the quality material he chose. His voice is suited to the genre and the Attractions give it all they've got, supported by some expert Nashville musicians. My faves are Tonight The Bottle Let Me Down, Too Far Gone, and especially Good Year For The Roses, a brilliant interpretation. It obviously doesn't appeal to all Elvis Costello fans, but I find it a pleasure to listen to, especially with the new added CD tracks."
5,This album is pure genius.,"I love this album. It is one of my all time favorite records by any artist, anywhere. I believe that 'Almost Blue' ranks up with the likes of 'Armed Forces', 'Trust', and 'Brutal Youth'.The highlights for me, are ""Why Don't You Love Me?"", ""Honey Hush"", ""Colour Of The Blues (VASTLY underrated)"", ""I'm Your Toy"", ""How Much I Lied"", ""Brown To Blue""... well, the whole darn album.I'm an 18 year old kid from Massachusetts, and because of this album I now have a love for country music that is only paralelled by my love for Elvis Costello's music."
2,so bad it's kinda good....,"""Why Don't You Love Me (Like You Used to Do?)"" and ""How Much I've Lied"" -- the tunes that open and close this collection, respectively -- are bold, affecting interpretations; but the ones that come between them are misguided, poorly performed horrors. The whole thing's like bad sandwhich: tasty bread, but the middle's just junk food...."
1,What the hell is this?,"Hmmm like some kind of experiment that got away, Almost blue is just plain weird. I just can't appreciate any of the material."
1,a crushing disappointment,"Prior to this, Elvis Costello made a series of rock records of such brilliance as to inspire the pursuit of a musical career in many of those who heard them. This album is a slap in the face to those people as well as to authentic country music performers who come from places like Birmingham, Alabama instead of Birmingham, West Midlands. This is a narcissistic, self-indulgent musical vanity project of the worst kind - an idea as stupid as Loretta Lynn rapping or Sean Combs attempting to sing Ella Fitzgerald or Roberta Flack songs. The more you like his first records the more you'll hate this one - don't waste your money."
1,What A Mess,"Ol Elvis wasnt up for this one. These songs need someone to SING them, and, at the time, EC didnt have the voice for it. The song composition is rather weak both for EC and the other writers. I think Elvis needed a cathartic alcohol-song purge here, and the way he sings on the disc is unfortunately apropos. If you loved Kojak Variety, you may like this. I'm a big fan, but I think this go round is a big mess."
4,Costello-politan - works for me.,"I think this is an album where either you're into it, or you aren't -- it isn't an issue of whether it's a ""good"" record, or a ""bad"" one. As a fan of Costello's early work, as well as a fairly well-informed country fan, I've found this to be an album that's grown on me over the years. He knew what is was doing, and he did it well. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Country Music)"
5,Genius,"A wonderful journey with Elvis; it opened my mind to good country music. Fun to listen to, fun to sing along with, and has held up beautifully over time."
4,Almost Brilliant,"Almost Blue works well because of the quality material he chose. His voice is suited to the genre and the Attractions give it all they've got, supported by some expert Nashville musicians like John McFee on lead and pedal steel guitars, and Tommy Miller on violin. The fast paced Why Don't You Love Me (Like You Used To Do) sounds more like early rock `n roll than country to me, whilst Sweet Dreams is done with feeling and lots of soul. Success is a gently lilting ballad with lovely piano. My favourites are the buoyant Tonight The Bottle Let Me Down, the moving Colour Of The Blues, this slow version of Too Far Gone, and especially the poignant Good Year For The Roses, a brilliant interpretation. Costello's country excursion reminds me of another highly successful country album by a UK artist, Marianne Faithfull's very authentic Faithless (also available as Dreamin' My Dreams). Almost Blue obviously won't appeal to all Elvis Costello fans, but I find it a pleasure to listen to."
4,A Kaleidoscope Of Sound,"Sadly for Roxy Music fans, Manzanera was pretty much relegated to the role of second banana by the time Avalon hit shelves in the early eighties. Gone were the looping, edgy guitar runs that marked key Roxy tracks like ""Both Ends Burning"" or ""Editions Of You"". On this, his third solo disc (fourth if you count 801 LIVE), Manzanera took all sorts of chances and came up with an inventive prog-rock album that sounded fun and varied. From ""Walking Through Heaven's Door"" (with its ""Kashmir""-like construction) to the cheesy Farfisa organ runs on the instrumental title track, the album has a little bit of everything for fans who've come to love the man's guitar work. Simon Phillips' intense drumming on the wistful ""Gone Flying"" is to-die-for while guest vocalists Tim and Neil Finn add the right amoount of pop fizz. Easily one of his finest and a find for Roxy Music fans with a fondness for cuts like ""Out Of The Blue"" and ""Mother Of Pearl"". Recommended!"
2,badly dated record,"If you want good pre-Avalon Manzanera get Diamond-Head and stay away from this record unless you like simplistic adolescent lyrics ('slow motion tv') and overly self-serious Geddy Lee-esque vocals (with lyrics triter than Peart's worst). Tim Finn of 'Split Enz' fame (infamy-?-) sings on many of the tracks and is painful to hear. John Wetton contributes one of his trademark Greg Lake vocal impersonations on 'numbers'. Really, the only listenable songs on the record are the instrumentals, 'k-scope' and 'n-shift'. The ultra cheesy production duo Godley and Creme make contributions to several tracks, and the fact that they are invisible here leads one to realize that most of the album is just as cheesy as they are; gorgonzola just can't compete with limberger, can it? In layman's terms, this album sucks; ignore any praise it may receive from essentialist rock critics who got their copies for free and don't care if you blow 14 clams on this slicked-out wank fest."
4,My son loves watching Diego,Good value for the 3 DVD pack. If your kids like Diego or dora they will like this DVD set also.
1,Not worth your time or money!,My 14 year old was very excited to buy this unicycle with his own money. Was very easy to put together but within the first 2 days of riding it bolts were broken and the tube has a leak. We have bought a patch kit and it still will not hold the air. After two trips to town and replacement tubes not fitting properly it is sitting in pieces on his bedroom floor. Thanks Mongoose for wasting our time.
2,$120 Later,"I got this for my daugther for Christmas,it came with no instrustions but we were able to put it together it wasn't that hard.The probem came when she attempted to ride it. The left crank fell off, we put it back on and again it came off. So I took it to a bike shop only to be told that the crake was bad and would have to be repleaced. So I am ording another one. At this point I wish I had purchased the Unicyle at the bike shop for $90.00."
1,this is the size for taller than 5 feet,"Mongoose 20-Inch Squid UnicycleI purchased this for my 9 years old son.This is heavy weight to handle.The tentacle frame's corner hits my sons inner knees.Assemble instruction does not mention which way to put volts,where to install 4 rubber sheets.we have to wait using this when my son gets taller than 5 feet.I am going to order the different 16""size unicycle."
3,BUMMED!!,"my daughter loves this cycle,although withih three days the right wheel bearing split open and she could not ride in the 4th of July parade, she was bummed, also the bearing on the right pedal is messed-up clicks rather than spins. hope this can be rectified soon. Called the company and was to hear back today and did not get an answer.product Mongoose Squid Unicycle (20 inch wheel)"
3,Heavy with flat tire,"It was somewhat of a pain assembling this, then only to find out it had a FLAT TIRE!!! Had to return it only after disassembling it. It's kind of heavy to lung around."
2,happy kid,he loves it but it came with two left cranks so the petals wont fit. try fixing that on christmas morning with nothing open!!! we finally found a petal that may work... we'll see
2,Poor instructions,I can't comment on the quality because I can't put it together. The single sheet instruction is laughable. My guess is the people having problems with this is due to bad assembly caused by the poor instructions. Customer service was very helpful though. give them a call.
4,Very Funny and FUN,Classic Italian humor at it's best. Yes there is some nudity and some sexy scenes (along with marching band music) A recommended movie!
3,The Sensuous Nurse,"This film was alright,but it really wasn't as good as I had hoped.There's no question that it could have been made much better.I sure am glad that I didn't have to pay for it.Amazon.com picked up the tab with a free gift certificate."
3,is a cool film,"I see the picture in my country 1978.It's a satire, very funny for relax.Ursula is a wonder his strip is a master piece. I recomenden this film."
5,An absolute must!,"This book is THE standard book for developing technical facility on the horn. The key to playing any instrument well is learning your way around the instrument, and this book is the best way to get there. Every serious trumpet player I have every met, including myself, has used this book and continues to use it. You will literally never outgrow this book. Go all the way through it, and then start over at the beginning at a faster tempo, and then do it again, and so on. If you use this book faithfully you will be astonished at how quickly your playing will improve. This book is one of the fundamental building blocks of playing the trumpet, no matter what style you play."
5,Excellent book of technical exercises for the developing trumpeter,"I am a student. My instructor is an outstanding professional, and he regularly gives me assignments from this book. I have been amazed how the exercises, if done correctly, have dramatically improved my skills on the trumpet. I highly recommend it."
1,"Great service, poor quality telephone.","Great service, poor quality telephone. Can almost hear phone in speaker phone mode. It went directly to the trash."
1,Frustrating low quality product,"I lost my last juicer to fire and started looking for a small good quality juicer. Waring sounded familiar and the juicer looked good. However i am so disappointed.My BJ120 Model 31JC25 is short of junk. Low quality light plastic which wobbles right and left and spills the juice. Watch the video, that's exactly it. I don't recommend this product at all. Please don't pay such a high price for this. Maybe for $25 it will be ok. Mind you, the motor may be strong and not too noisy. I'm trying to be fair.I did not buy it from Amazon since Amazon does not mail this type of merchandise to PR. I bought it in internet though. Did not return it because i was going on for a long stay in Europe and could not manage it at the time."
5,Finally Venom live on DVD!!!!,"After watching this show for about a 100 times on video ( under the name: Alive in '85 ) I'm still glad that it is released on DVD! Great sound and picture quallity, and a great show of the world's only true Black Metal band. I'm following these guys now for about 20 years,and they are still the best band in the world!!! The only bad thing on this DVD is the discography; it's all wrong! And so is the biography, but he....it's the music that counts, and that's still great!!!"
4,Great package!,I bought this as a gift along with a grilling recipes book. It was very well received and is great for people just starting out using a grill or who want to add a little spice to their grilling!
4,Great book for dog lovers.,"This book made our vacation to St. Augustine great. Our boxers had a great time, especially at the beach! Thanks Sally, Robert and Maggie!"
4,nice clips,"They are NOT carbon fiber as it claims in the description, they are polymer. That being said, they are great for attaching items to my blackhawk! backpack."
4,Handy,Ever want to attach a belt loop to MOLLE - here's the solution. Two through the MOLLE then weave two through the belt loop and attach them horizontally on the other two.
4,i don't know of a better way to do molle,"molle/pals can be tedious at best, these clips are light weight and rugged. i find them to be the easiest quickest way to go. it is good to keep a table knife handy and best to use a tounge depresser when you weave your molle."
5,Excellent Alternative,"I ordered two packs of these (#3 and #5) because I was super irritated with trying to weave Maxpedition tac ties into MOLLE webbing. It was an outstanding decision.The speed clips work perfectly, and they make it remarkably easy to move MOLLE attachable gear from one pack to another. You don't need any tools or anything, and it takes a couple of minutes to attach something, and a few seconds to take it off again.Love Maxpedition gear, but these Blackhawk clips are so much better than any flexible ties I've used. I have no complaints."
4,Better than Tac Ties,"Maxpedition's Tac Ties are a fine product, but these are GRRREAT! Easy on, easy off, hold tight, and without the frustration of the Tac Ties. I use my Maxpedition Malaga for a man purse most days, and a day pack when I do short hikes. You just don't want to carry all the same STuff and the Malaga doesn't have a regular place for a waterbottle so you need a outside pocket. With Speed Clips I can add or remove the outside goodies I want in minutes and be headed out on the next adventure, whether to the woods or the local coffee house."
3,"Not worth the money, get them cheaper elsewhere.","I absolutely love these earrings but they are not worth $39.99, I was expecting a longer stick on each end and a little thicker. These are very light, good for your ears but it makes them swing too much. I bought a similar pair at a mall jewelry store, sterling silver, longer sticks for $12.00 but with a swarovski crystal on one end. I really liked the idea of a stick on each end but I was expecting a little more bulk. These are almost invisible when you're wearing them unless you get up close."
3,Delta Dado Insert,"The size of the insert fits well with my table saw. However, there is no effective way to secure the insert to keep it from vibrating or moving a bit while in use. This is a design flaw that could be corrected by providing an anchor screw like those available for the regular blade insert."
5,Great Dado blade,"I have had a very good experience using this dado blade so far. I have only used it on poplar wood, but it has given good service. The steel shims are great, the cut is clean."
2,Insert Doesn't Fit!!!,"I own a Delta 10"" Professional model table saw. One of the first and most necessary accessories I bought was a dado blade which entailed buying the table insert. After double checking model numbers, etc. to make sure I was buying the right thing, I got it home and it didn't fit. I had to use my angle grinder and quite a bit of time to make it fit. The insert works great now, but it was extremely frustrating having to ""custom fit"" it to my table saw, especially when the model number was supposed to fit properly."
4,Great Idea but NOT an incredible book,"I am a 10th grade teacher so I read all of the books that I will teach my students. One of these was Farenheit 451. I know it's a classic and I love Ray Bradbury but this book is famous more for the idea than the actual story. This is the type of book that you could discuss but not the type of book I would recommend for pleasure reading. Some of his other works and short stories I find much better than this including the one he references in the book, The Pedestrian. Ray Bradbury is great but don't read this book thinking that you will be completely engrossed from page one. However, if you want something to really think about and an idea that is incredibly interesting this is the ticket."
3,"Another disappointing ""classic""","I sometimes think people rate classics high because they felt they were supposed to and not because they are a good read. I am trying to read more ""classics"" and am fairly consistently disappointed. This book was no exception to that. While I found it entertaining at times, I didn't find it captivating or life changing. In fact, it was somewhat difficult and disjointed at times. I am glad I read it (if only because I felt I was supposed to) but I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it to others. Let's see what other Bradbury books say to me."
4,a troubling prophecy,"Even more troubling reading this book now, than 25 years ago in high school. How did all of this come true? (What forces on high--or down below--are at work in the world!?! It is well-written, too, nuanced and complex. It's not the ""best"" book I've ever read, but it's a very important book to read. It would have been an easy read, an enjoyable read, if I were reading it in 1953 instead of now (I can't believe this was written in 1953).. (Ironic that this was required reading in school! I'm sure that it's not anymore...)"
2,There is much better albums from Larry then this.,"I would not say this one is one of the best efforts from Larry Peirce. Although this album is better then ""I want to be a pimp"" it is nowhere near as good as his earlier albums. On here it sounds like some of the older songs recycled into a new way of singing it, but not nearly half as good. About the best song on here is ""If she wants romance (just unzip my pants)"" but even as the best on the album, I would only give that song a 3 out 5 rating. It's a real shame that this is one of the only albums still able to be purchased, they really need to re-issue his best stuff again like ""Songs from the locker room"" and ""Hard hat hits""."
2,Scattered storyline that jumped the shark,"The weakest book so far in the series. Implausible plot twists. Still, I enjoy the main character, and there is great potential in future books. I will stick with it."
4,The Kydd series is getting better with each book,"""Mutiny"" is the fourth book in Julian Stockwin's ""Kydd"" series. These books are set in the Napoleonic-era Royal Navy and follow in the same vein as C.S. Forester's Horatio Hornblower and Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin books.In the first book, Kydd was initially a pressed seaman, but by ""Mutiny"" he has worked himself up to a master's mate. After a couple of adventures in the Mediterranean, Kydd ends up embroiled in the Nore mutiny. Stockwin's well-researched account of the mutiny is very well-done.Although it has taken a few books, I'm finally truly enjoying Julian Stockwin's books. ""Mutiny"" is the best, most entertaining of the series so far. Kydd is growing as a character and Stockwin's writing style is developing. Anyone who has enjoyed Horatio Hornblower or Patrick O'Brian will enjoy these books."
1,camera would not download pictures,I bought this camera for my husband 2 years ago. Worked fine until recently would not download pictures. I ordered a new battery and it still didn't work.A real dissapointment.Would never recommend it.Sorry
1,POS,"I bought this thing six months ago and I must say the quality of the photos and the duribility of the c-50 was horrible! Get this, I just returned it because it broke and it has been discontinued. SIX MONTHS AGO THIS WAS THE SHING DING. Olympus makes a great product and I exchanged it for the c-5000, 5 star for that one. Please stay away from the c-50, it has been discontinued so if it breaks and no warrenty, SOL."
3,Dying after 3 years of use?,"As reported by others, my lens cover is giving up its ghost. The camera does not turn on everytime on first attempt. Opening the cover and general cleaning did not help. The power-down mechanism is still very effective though - sometimes in the middle of composing a shot, it would power down at the slightest provocation.It was a great camera 3+ years back with a solid feel and a compact size then. Now it is neither here nor there; the superzoom cameras have made a 3x optical lens obsolete (or, ""entry"" level only) and the really compact cameras have made this look like a tank.Losing a camera in slightly over 3 years is not good; my Minolta SLR from 1990 is still functional a 100%.I suppose it is time to buy again and I will buy another Olympus this time , probably the E-500 with dual lens kit. That would allow me to use the current remote - and I have been VERY satisfied with the optics."
5,Great pictures with ease,"I have had this camera for about a month. It meets or exceeds my expectations except for the editing software.It is small and light to fit in my pocket.It makes crisp clear shots that can be enlarged - A face in the crowd can be enlarged it seems forever before it begins to break up.It is fast. On a par with my 35mm.Automatic setting are easy to use and provide so much flexibility that I have not felt the need to use the manual overides.I got the 128 mb card that holds about 115 high res pictures.The cameral is very small and thus the viewing screen is small. This makes it difficult to see the pictures and printing if your eyesight, as mine, is not very good. Practice with the the menus before picture time has helped.The Camedia editing software works but I find it awkward. To be used properly it has to be upgraded for a few bucks but I would hope there is something better available."
2,olyokolympus,"I could not agree more on the issue not brought up here regarding xD memory that this camera is limited to. As if there were not already enough memory formats, yet another one. It seems to be about either desperate, or greedy companies trying to capture customers into their markets forever. Why can't we just have one or two formats of memory?? This is as bad as it would be to have 5+ formats of CD-RoM drives. And SONY is even more guilty than fuji/olympus.Smartmedia was developed by Toshiba/Fuji/Olympus, and now Fuji/Olympus couldn't get along with Toshiba/Panasonic for the sD card. Memeory cards will become more and more versatile into the future and soon be used in countless devices. We need to standardize the market. We can't afford to buy special memory for each and every device. If you buy Fuji/0lympus, I sincerely suggest you buy a camera that is not limited to xD such as the C-5050 (drools over it). Together the people can control the market for our own good.."
1,Beware of this camera: mine won't turn on anymore,"I received this camera last year for Christmas (12/2004) and it is almost unusable now because the sliding door in the front doesn't switch the camera on. The door is on a thin, plastic rail that has bent and now it isn't positioned properly to hit the on switch. If I push the door in while I slide it open, it will turn on; however, in the middle of taking pictures it will shut off again. I treated the camera like gold, too, always keeping it in a protective case and it was never dropped or banged up. I find it very frustrating that an expensive camera like this could be designed so poorly."
3,Great pics....sometimes,"This is my 7th digital camera and I've taken and published pictures around the world. The auto focus on the C-50 is spotty, sometimes very good and more often producing a blurred picture. When its good its very good, color is great, 5MP gives you a lot of room for editing and cropping, etc., but the overall performance is average. A coworker has the same camera, has the same opinion. Just ""lost"" a couple of great shots from a trip to Europe, not too satisfied at the moment."
2,ok until....,"this camera worked fine for me until i had problems with closing the cover, which caused the camera to turn off and on automatically. a very simple design defect that new purchasers are unlikely to spot, but which has destroyed my enjoyment of the camera. it was only then that i discovered that olympus after-sales service leaves a lot (ie everything) to be desired. it was a fine camera while it lasted, but there are plenty out there with the same features and without the design defect... i'm defecting to the competition."
1,defective,I received the camera and after trying to work with it I discovered the slide on the door was no good and the camera would shut itself off with the door open. I tried may different ways to see if I could get it not to turn itself off with no success. I notified the seller and was sent a RMA number to return the camera. As of today I received an email that my account will be refunded for the full price. That is a seller that I would buy from in the future since he stands behind their product. Thank you for everything.
3,"weak materials, warranty didn't cover damage","while i was happy with the picture quality, except for theabundance of red-eye in photos, i had a reocurring problemwith the track of the cover chipping and causing the slidinglens cover to loosen and even come off. this was a huge problem because the buttons that control the camera turning on and off are triggered by the sliding door and this is affected by the door being loose or coming off. this was considered""damage due to rough handling"" or something like that, so ipaid 180.00 to have it repaired only for it to happen again,withing a couple months of the repair.i never dropped it. i kept it in a case, so i am convincedthat the materials on the track that the cover slides on aremade of weak materials. i decided to live with it for a whileand finally gave up and bought a different camera.the e-mail i sent to olympus customer service was handled witha form letter with no answer to my specific questions."
2,POOR SHELF LIFE,"My husband purchased this camera for me a few years ago. I didn't use the camera very much. As a matter of fact, it still has the original stickers on it. Many add-ons were purchased at the time, some of which I have never used and are still in their factory sealed packages. After the waranty was up I started experiencing problems with the retractable lens; it would not extend out when I opened the sliding door. I have tried to get the sensor part required to fix the problem, from Olypus, but they say the only thing I can buy is a new battery cover. I told them that I was recently advised that poor sensors is a common problem with their retractractable lenses and replacements should be made available. The representative said I could send the camera in to them and they would fix the problem for $125.00 What nerve! I will never buy another Olympus product and I will tell everyone I know about this issue."
1,Olympus C50 Poor Red Eye,Almost all pictures with or without the reduction come out with red eye. Not worth the valuse for family photos even if you can take it out with software.
3,Olympus C-50,"I've been using this camera a lot now that I have a baby.It works fine even when he runs around, but ONLY if I use the flash.Without the flash, the pictures get blurry.The video only lasts 16 seconds without sound. It has NO audio! That sucks big time.The memory card that comes with it is way way too small. Definely needs to buy a bigger memory card.My sister got a much cheaper camera and it has audio without the limited recording length time. I'm considering buying another camera, and give this one to my 21 months son!!!Also, the x-D card are more expensive than other memory card."
2,huge disappointment,"I just received this camera, I ordered this one after I dropped my power shot elf - 2.1 from canon, I loved this camera and thought I was ready for an upgrade. Well not this one. The Olympus S50 did not do what I thought it would.Almost all the pictures I took were blurry, took to much time in between the images, soft ware has a lot to be desired, manual in the package is flimsy - not at all what I am used to from the user friendly canon. I am sending it back and getting the upgrade from canon Powershot S400 and never changing again."
2,The camera itself isn't the problem,"I've never owned a digital camera before, and bought this one on the advice of a trusted photoshop guy. I have no basis of comparison for the actual photos it takes or the features in the camera. However, I find the software and the lack of effective instruction so appalling that it makes me regret buying this camera. ... Of course, there is no ""troubleshooting"" guide to tell me what's wrong. If I'm going to spend even more cash for software, I would consider Adobe Photo Album--but I am not looking for any more disappointments. Obviously, I am not the ""technical"" person most people are--but I was hoping I wouldn't have to have been."
5,Necesito Informacion,"señores AmazonYo deseo comprar la Camara Digital Olympus C 50 5MP, yo vivo en Cali - Colombia y quisiera saber si ustedes me envian a mi ciudad Cali la camara y si tiene algun costo el envio.Agradezco su pronta respuesta.Mil graciasJuan Carlos Chemás"
2,Keep Looking,"I bought this camera based on several reviews most notably Consumer Reports.Size good. Battery life good. 5 megapixels very good. My experience using the camera not good--too much red eye, weak zoom and not durable. My camera quit working after just 3 months. It jammed in the open position. It was not wet or exposed to sand. However, all of those things can void the warranty."
4,lighting still a problem,"This camera takes great shots - but low light is still an issue. Even taking a picture of someone sitting inside with the sun shining on them through a window will still blur if there's any motion.It also takes a good 3 seconds or so for the camera to ready itself to take a picture. I've missed a few spontaneous shots because it couldn't extend the lens fast enough.Other than that the camera is great. It's super small, so it fits in my jeans pockets. The 5 megapixels shots are huge and can make 8x10 prints.I would recommend a spare battery if you're going to do extensive shooting. I usually recharge before I head off somewhere, but if you run out of juice halfway through your tourist day, you're out of luck until you can get back to the hotel and plug it in."
4,Very Good Compact Digicam,"I loved my Olympus D-40 Zoom, which this camera replaces. It took very nice pictures, and despite annoying shutter lag, it served me very well. (I lost it during my honeymoon and nearly cried -- fortunately I had just replaced the 128 mb memory card so I didn't lose all of my pictures too.) I just bought this camera and am pleased so far. The shutter lag seems improved. My only concern is a bit of red eye in the pictures I have taken, but I haven't used the red eye reduction flash yet. And, of course, software can remove the problem easily enough. The camera is not quite as small as my Minolta Dimage X, but 5 megapixels are much better than 2, and it is still pretty small -- fitting easily in a jacket or pants pocket. Just be careful and don't lose it!"
3,"For Taylor Fans, This CD Rocks","While this live recording does not capture virtuoso performance that Mick Taylor is capable of delivering, he still manages to display melodic lead playing like no one else. Credit goes to the band and Carla Olson, whose vocal style has rough edges that can be either annoying or funky, depending on your point of view, for putting a nice collection of rockers and blues derivatives, on which Mick's talens are showcased. A definite must have for Mick Taylor fans, I would also recommend this CD for those interested in British guitar players. For die hard Stones fans, Silver Train alone is worth the price of this CD."
4,A winning combination,"I was looking for something different when I came across this live recording. Olson's southern blues-rock style paired with Taylor was a good one on this live outing.Taylor locked in nicely behind Olson's band on a number of her songs, such as ""Midnight Mission.""The cover of ""Silver Train"" was also a great one. I had not heard of Olson until this, but I love her voice, then and now."
1,horrible,"my kids love little bear. I ordered this one because it had the episode ""Marbles"" on it which they love. All the episodes were cut so they were starting in the middle of the episode there were no stop and starts so the stories just go right into the other one, very confusing, and the marbles episode started half way in so you don't even understand why he is doing what he is doing. HATE IT. very disspaointed"
5,Costellian Staple,"Any fan of Elvis Costello must add Trust to their collection. Unlike other compilations, Trust is not a mix of top hits. Rather, it brings together finer songs from Mr. Costello's and the Attractions' collaborations.As a bonus, Trust offers 7 previously unreleased and delicious versions of songs ranging from old jazz tunes and newer Costellian jewels."
3,And now the decline begins...,"Costello starts his long, slow decline with this album. Some good songs, but lots of filler. His vices (patching phrases together and calling them songs, rewriting other composer's melody lines in his key, etc.) are more than apparent here."
4,"unstable, unfocused, & totally essential","this is truly a ""transitional"" album. both the young, snotty elvis and the middle-aged, bitter elvis can be heard in these intricate, claustrophobic songs. elvis sounds like he's not entirely in control of his unruly band or his thorny, difficult songs here, and he doesn't really seem to care. the end result is rewarding, but only for the previously committed. trust me...."
5,Essential Elvis!,"Trust indeed catches Elvis in a period of transition. He seems to be growing away from the thumping pop hooks to more sophisticated, although somber, material. I believe he delivers in both areas, popping and rocking on great tracks like ""Strict Time"" (give it a listen above), ""From a Whisper to a Scream"" (with Squeeze's Glenn Tillbrook) and ""Fish and Chip Paper""- whilst toning it down to great effect on ""Watch Your Step"" and ""Big Sister's Clothes"". I don't think his vocals have ever sounded this good. If you are someone who is trying to figure out what Elvis is all about, I would suggest this album. It may not have all the hits, but catches him at the first fork in his career road. I highly recommend it. I have every one of Elvis's CDs and this remains my favorite."
2,Very Ordinary Performance,"One can't blame Mr Kapp for trying. However, he does not have a natural feel for these pieces or if he does, it is not evident in this recording. The rhythm and the maintenance thereof is not necessarily strict and makes the listener feel uncomfortable. The violin playing and especially its double stops are not well-executed and many of the tempi appear contrived and unoriginal. The only redeeming feature is the recorder playing which is just gorgeous.Not the most outstanding buy, but the price is right."
2,"Not the best, not the worst","Well, Richard Kapp is still a ""hot head"" unfortunately. His ego makes communication difficult. One need not praise him because he is adept at praising himself. And if you disagree with him you are ""wrong.""This performance of the Brandenburgs is not great, but it is also far from bad. I agree he does not necessarily understand the music. Some of it sounds awkward. The excellence of the musicians seems to come through in spite of him.Perhaps a good recording for beginners who are not aware of the missing nuances in this performance."
2,"Bowies, Big Knives...by Bagwell",The author dwells too much on knife fighting rather than the knives. I found the book to be a disappointment.
3,Interesting but blow-hard flawed,"It is an interesting book. Bagwell's repeated condemnation of knives less than 9 inches long wears pretty thin though. And on this point he doesn't know what he's talking about - there are situations (fighting a large animal,eg,) where a blade longer than 7 inches will rapidly become a liability.Also his pronouncements on the absence of effective short blade fighting tradition in Japan is just wrong.And would anyone really choose that U-shaped Chilean military knife over a Kbar in combat???"
3,Nice look.. but too small !,"First, I don't know why this product is advertised solely for the Nikon 2500; the Nikon 3500 has the same body (just more resolution) and therefore all of the products bundled in this product shall apply as accesories for the Nikon 3500 as well.The camera case is the only available (from Nikon) for the Nikons 2500 and 3500. I think that a slightly larger case would make a big difference. The problem in this case is that... it is so small, that you cannot acces the front bag without first removing the camera from the case. Also, you cannot carry the camera, extra battery, and the cleaning cloth in the case. So the cleaning cloth will end up in a drawer and not where it should be (always near the camera :)"
1,Not a fan,"The service was horrible, my book never came, they never responded to my messages, they sent two automated responses telling me to wait but no personal message telling me what happened. The tracking on Amazon didn't work at all, I believe it's because they didn't even have the book. I read some of the negative reviews and all of them sounded like what happened to me! Do not use this seller!!!!!!"
3,This is not a book for technologists.......,"I read this book after reading MDA Explained by Anneke Kleppe and found it wandering into many areas but not deep enough in any one of them. While this book is a decent attempt to bring forth the impact of MDA in enterprise computing, a reader looking to understand ""what"" MDA is and ""how it"" works would be thoroughly disappointed. MDA Explained is a far more useful (and thinner) book that is not only more readable but also lucid in explanation."
3,"Superb performance, horrific sound quality","If you're reading this then you are probably already familiar with the genius of John Martyn. And if you've ever been fortunate enough to catch him live (I saw him in Tokyo in the early '90's) then you know what a tight, passionate performer he is. Not to mention a wicked guitarist. I was so excited when I saw that this DVD was available. On Ktel? Hey, power to them. Well, I wish I could say that this DVD is everything I hoped it to be. The performance, an intimate London club setting, is top rate. Now for the bad news: the sound quality is HORRENDOUS. Completely distorted and tinny. I hestitantly give it 3 starsbecause at this price, its a value. But if you don't yet have the ""Philethropy"" cd, his 1983 live masterpiece, it is is a MUCH better investment, a 5 star thrilling addition to your collection."
5,Great DVD!!,This dvd is truly awesome. I've been a fan of LOTNC from the beginning. The image and sound are really good for an older dvd. It's a shame that this dvd is out of print.
5,Best value starter knife on the market,"First the bad:1.) Made in China instead of in Germany2.) Stamped instead of forged blade3.) Plastic handleNow for the good:1.) Full tang instead of fake handle2.) Stamped high-carbon stainless-steel blades3.) Dishwasher-safe (though not recommended)4.) Full Henckels lifetime warranty5.) Low-cost but high-value6.) All the utility of much more expensive knivesThis knife is available at Target for the same price, but the full set on Amazon is a better value overall if you don't already have a knife set. If you have any aspirations of some day owning a great knife set, you owe it to yourself to get this knife or its set to learn how to care for a more expensive set. This knife will provide years of solid use while giving you an idea of what it takes to properly care for a fine blade. If you're the average amateur chef, you'll probably abuse this knife or possibly even chip the edge, which you would NOT want to do with a $200 knife."
3,A Thin bladed knife.,"This knife is sharp, but it is too thin. The blade is very thin. When you have to apply pressure to the top of the blade, it could hurt your hand or finger. Spend more money and get the quality knife."
2,All Henckels are NOT created equal...,"Okay, so this knife only costs around $14. There you have it -- that's the sole ""plus"" of buying this knife! It's an uncomfortable knife to use, the blade is TOO thin, it doesn't keep a sharp edge for very long, and yes, when slicing veggies they WILL stick to the sides of this knife. It's ""made in China"" of course, and while the workmanship seems acceptable, the quality of the blade and the function makes me REALLY wish I had known enough to pay a little extra to get one of the Zwilling (made in Germany) Henckels Santoku blades instead. Unless you want a ""beater"" knife to just take abuse in the kitchen, stay away from this cheapo Santoku!"
2,Disappointed,"Sue Civil-Brown is one of my favorite authors. I really enjoy her books under Rachael Lee as well. Something was just missing in this book. I kept reading anticipating better things...but unfortunately it never materialized. I never felt close to the characters. Normally in Sue Civoil-Brown's books..TEMPTING MR. WRIGHT and CHASING RAINBOW...you felt like you at least knew the characters involved. Samantha's character was alittle understandable but somewhat shallow. The real difficult one to understand was Derek. He just seemed to appear in Florida, crew and everything. I wont go into the plot because it would ruin the story....if you can call the plot a story. I'm very sorry to say that the book did absolutely nothing for me. The ending was very bland and silly. It didn't even make sense. This was a big disappointment for me and I feel let down by the author. A side note...maybe shorten some of the ""silly findings"" and lengthen the characters."
2,"Yuck, I expected much more!",I have read all of S.C. Browns and have enjoyed them in the past but I absolutely hated this one. Boring and completely inane plot! Usually I pass books on to my friends and this one went in the trash. I hated it!
4,True's follow up,"After the success of the True album, the Ballet were always gonna struggle to top it, but they almost did. With strong songs such as Round & Round, I'll Fly For You and Highly Strung this is as enjoyable to trip through as True. It mirrors True in many ways...the lush ballads and the up beat rhythms of the support tracks.True was their peak, Parade sustained the joy but it was mostly down hill after Parade."
4,French Music is the best,Bye Bye American pie. The music in America is dead. I blame George Bush for that. French music is the bomb.
5,Live IT up!!!,"I love this CD, I already owned it as a cassette, but brought it again. Johansen's voice is strong and the Animal's songs are done well with conviction. Funky but Chic is another winner, It's a real well done live LP."
4,4 stars.,"**** In a world where it often seems like the only right some vocal people are willing to grant Christians is the right to remain silent, it is easy to begin to wonder, ""am I wrong to believe?"" Addressing this question with solid reasons why you are not wrong to believe and what makes Christianity logical, this book will give you the confidence to deal with a world in which Christans are resident aliens. How do we know we have a soul and are more than animals? What about the strange things in the Old Testament that often seem bizarre and harsh? Did a lot of books get left out of the Bible? The answers to these questions and more will give you surety that not only are you, the Christian not wrong, but you are right. ****Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
3,More subjective picking & choossing,"This is an excellent book for anyone who confronts today's Evangelicals. It's a good demonstration of the expected subjective selection between which Biblical passages are chosen to be re-interpreted and which are held to be unquestionably true as-is. Mr. Copan does an excellent job of stressing that certain difficult passages (e.g. Jacob's sacrifice of Isaac) must be viewed in terms of the environments in which they were created: locations, point in times, and overall contexts in which they appear. Unfortunately, for Biblical passages which support his particular prejudices, he does no more than assert that they are self-evidently true and must be taken as-is. Hopefully, anyone reading this book will be able to see the ironic light in which this casts Evangelicalism, and will go on to view ALL Biblical passages with regards to the evironments in which they were created."
3,depressing,"I bought these cards for my sister, who has two beagles. It is hard to find Christmas cards with beagles on them! I find the picture on the card a little sad: these poor dogs are being teased. There is only one bone: who will get to chew it if they ever get it down?! Anyway, the inside is nicer than most of the other twelve cards, as the picture on the inside is far away from the writing. But please, Santa, bring these guys more bones!"
1,Don't even bother,"I bought this pedometer hoping that it would motivate me to walk more. Needless to say, it's been sitting on my desk since I bought it 3 weeks ago because it's useless. It took me about 30 minutes to program it when I got it. Once I started using it, I found it was INCREDIBLY inaccurate. I would be sitting at my desk and look down and it would be counting steps. If I was walking it would count steps and add an additional 5 once I stopped. I found this pedometer to be useless."
3,AN 11 YEAR OLD MUSIC FAN THOUGHT THIS SUCKED,THIS IS ONE OF MY WORST ALBUMS I THOUGHT AFTER ALL THESE YEARS SNOOP COULD COME UP WITH SOMETHING BETTER THAN THIS. THERE IS SOME TIGHT SONGS ON IT. GET 2001 ARE ELSE STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON. TRY A NEW BAND CALLED JURASSIC 5 THAT ARE TOP NOTCH THEY BRING A WHOLE NEW MEANING TO HIP-HOP. TRY SOME MC-REN STUFF IT'S VERY UNDERATED.
1,Absolutely terrible,"A couple of years ago, my friends and I got a big kick out of how funny we thought this album was. Well, honestly, this is one of the worst albums by anyone ever. If you are an absolute die-hard fan of rap and must own every album ever, then maybe consider it. Otherwise, don't bother. It is a waste of your money and time. Don't let people tell you it is good either...all the reviews for this album are a joke done by the same group of people."
1,Why?,"You must be kidding me. Jermaine Dupri made Kris Kross credible for a minute but NOBODY can help these two. If they do a video w/ fine women, I will vomit. Ok? Stick to eating in movies. Ya'll got that locked down."
5,DRUMS! I LOVE THE DRUMS!,"This is a great album. The drums are so whacky, just like my eyes. I want to join this band because the drums are so cool. This is a good very album."
4,A Very Good Documentary,This documentary was very convincing. I now believe in aliens after seeing this. You will too. I would definatly recommend it.WARNING: It's very creepy!
1,About as fake as can be !,"I was wanting this tape to be the smoking gun, something different than the rest of the stuff out there. The so called alien interview is so fake it's comical that anyone would believe it's real! There is no audio at all, so that tells me right there that it was probably staged by actors. And the alien looks and moves like a puppet, not like any real being. This movie is a total hoax, I wish someone really would come forward with the truth once and for all. Come on Victor give us something better than this, lol"
3,Watch your back !,"I purchased the advertised NEW modem. I recieved an opened box / used modem. The rubber feet had dust and hairs on them from the previous owner. So I feel like I got ripped off. My advice is to watch your back if you choose to do business with Westronics / Amazon. You could get ripped off. The modem operation is only average and does seem slightly slow. However, in my case, I don't know if this slowness is because this is actually a defective returned item or if this is the normal modem operation. What a scam !"
2,This Product Is A Ripoff,"This Product Is A Ripoff. It will not operate with either Windows Vista or Windows 7. Further, it is no longer supported technically by US Robotics because it is too old. None of these facts are mentioned in the product description here."
5,Sweet Puppy,"This is an extremely well-made image, showing that which endears puppies and other young creatures to us all, a sweet young face, sound asleep. I know my heart melts at the sight. I love dogs, and puppies are especially dear to me. I don't think anyone could resist that sweet, peaceful face!"
2,Worth borrowing ...,"The photography is clearly less than professional. None of these photographs would make an Architectural Digest cut, and, as a side note, neither would the decor of these homes ... lots of over-paid-for tacky stuff being shown off. Worth borrowing for curiosity's sake."
1,THIS BOOK IS NOT WORTH IT,"this book is not worth it.. the pictures are not really good, not interesting, and by the 5th page you are bored already.. I find no good reason to buy this book as I find the photographers work to be mediocre, leaning to poor work...I am sorry but If you are intersted in photography I would seriously recommend the work of Bravo or other more artistic photographers.."
4,Captain and Commander3,I ordered this CD after watching movie. It's good music to eat to as its similar recordings are all baroque quartets.
3,"nice background music, forgettable","This is a bunch of rather quiet and low key chamber music. I'm not a performer myself, I bought this after reading all the Patrick O'Brian books and seeing ""Master & Commander"".The performances seem good, but nothing really caught or held my attention - this is good background music during a work day.I'd bought this after seeing the Master & Commander film - the music in the film a great deal more memorable"
1,Defective Item,"This CD did not play at all in my two CD players. It did play on my 2 Macs (1 laptop and 1 desktop) and a PC laptop but there was a loud, rhythmic ""scratching"" sound in the background that rendered the music unbearable. I tried to download the songs to iTunes but the distortion remained. I returned the CD and ordered another, which Amazon makes very easy to do, but the second CD was as defective as the first. I looks like a great CD but the two copies I've had, both produced by ESS.A.Y Recordings, were thoroughly defective."
2,Not as purported...,"Musical Evenings with the Captain, though musical evokes a decidedly sullen mood in the listener and does so without reprieve. At least this was the effect on my family and me. We found the recommended companion CD Musical Evenings in the Captains Cabin much more uplifting and more like what you might expect Captain Jack Aubrey to be playing with Doctor Maturin in his cabin.Let's face it, most of us are in search of the final duet played in the film Luigi Boccherini's ""La Musica Notturna Delle Strade di Madrid no. 6, op. 30, however the phrase or movement in the film is not the one on the soundtrack. I have read that this movement is Passacalle From Quintettino, but have not, as yet, confirmed this. Amazon should have this available if you dig. Please let me know if you find it!Buy Musical Evenings with the Captain if you are a real Baroque buff but Musical Evenings in the Captains Cabin if you are looking for more the ilk of what was played in the film."
1,Laughable,"Actually I've wanted to try this album for once, K'maro is made me laugh on the floor. Not because he can't sing, use of Franglish and low quality songs. He leads the bad stars after Günther as second place."
5,Great saw.,I bought the Delta left tilt arbor Unisaw. I'm very happy with it. I could have purchased either the Powermatic or the General. The attention to detail on the machining seems better on the Delta than the other machines.
3,A little disappointing...,"This album is packed with flute blockbusters, but the flutist does not live up to the greatness of the music. His tone is often fuzzy and I don't agree with a lot of his interpretations. On the plus side, the recordings are well mixed so you can always hear the flute. This is a good CD for the wide sample of great music."
2,Can't get past the taste and texture,I will not buy this again. The texture and taste is simply something I can't get past.I add water to my protein powders after lifting and this won't work for me.
3,Not so chocolatey...,"This protein, in my opinion, is not the best tasting protein. I did find that if i mixed it with a different chocolate protein than it was more tolerable. By itself, in water , forget about it! Nasty! If you mix it with something like vanilla almond milk, or coconut milk it is tolerable. Wasn't too satisfied with the taste but im sure i got the protein i needed from it."
2,Too chalky,I just couldn't get used to the texture. I tried so many combinations but it wasn't working for me. I also don't ever normally use protein powder so I'm not the best judge on this.
2,Tastes like gritty dirt,"Nutribiotic rice protein sounded like a good alternative to the whey protein I usually use.I mixed it in a bender like I do with the whey powder. It actually blends well, but the taste is not smooth and creamy like the whey. I sometimes blend cook brown rice with water and even that tastes better than this."
2,Not for me...,"I bought the chocolate kind a while back, and I still absolutely CANNOT find a way to make it edible. I love bitter stuff and rarely eat sugary things, so I don't think that's the problem. Any which way, this protein powder just makes me gag and feel physically ill after I eat/drink it. I've tried mixing it in water, almond/rice/coconut milk (all unsweetened - result = unmixable), yoghurt (plain - result = clumpy and... warm? ew?), even oatmeal (plain - mixed well but still tasted horrible). I do wish I could tolerate this stuff: the nutritional specs are fantastic. I haven't tried any other brands, but now I'm a bit wary of rice protein powder as a whole."
2,Does not mix with water or milk,"I did not like the product since it tastes chalky and does not mix with water, but then again...I don't know that I have a powder that I actually love...but The Vitamin Shoppe is a GREAT seller! They took the product back, no questions asked AND customer service was also VERY helpful and quick"
1,Inedible,I only gave this 1 star because Amazon makes you give at least one star.DO NOT BUY THIS!This stuff is disgusting. Seriously. You shouldn't sell it. I have had tons of brands of Soy and Whey protein and this is nothing like them. It tastes like chalk and does not dissolve *at all*!
3,A House in Sicily,"The colorful characters and the the descriptions of the beautiful town, Taormina are well done. It is a lovely little trip to Sicily."
4,Life in Sicily,"This was a very good read. It took abt 50 pages for me to get ""into it"". Once past that point this was a fast and enjoyable read!The author learned the ""ways"" of life in Sicily.Her stories and visitors are interesting."
2,"Vignettes of Sicilian Life, But Difficult to Enjoy","Phelps' style doesn't seem quite right for a book about Sicily/Italy. It's a little to sparse and long winded for my taste, and I found myself forcing myself to finish the book."
2,The House in Sicily,"Because I am going to Sicily for 2 weeks I have bought quite a few books on the subject. I couldn't really get into this book, it was slow and I expected to be taken on a new experience like the author had by living there. More description of the people, food, customs and atmosphere was needed."
2,There are better memoirs ...,"I usually love memoirs set in Italy, but was quite disappointed by this book. I was interested in the author's description of post-World War II life in Sicily, but her condescending comments about the ""child-like"" Sicilians (who made her life easier) were rather surprising. Her very obvious disdain for them reduced my enjoyment of the rest of her writing. Not recommended!"
2,Not complete,A fun book to read.Unfortunately for me I wish I learned more about the Sicilian character.I found Ms. LiCastri-Babcock review right on target.Ms. Phelps was not very generous in describing obvious romatic interludes. After all she was in Sicily.
2,"""50 years in Sicily and I'm still English!""","Another ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" story of the Mayles variety. This time our narrator is an Englishwoman who inherits a house in Sicily and turns it into a guest house in order to make ends meet. With guests like Bertrand Russell, Henry Faulkner, and Roald Dahl this could have been interesting. Instead it's more stories of ""how quaint these people are,"" even the local mafia chief! Lacking depth and detail, this book substitutes cute stories of the people and their way of life. Even the stories that were humorous are retold rather archly and with a disaffected attitude."
1,Totally unreadable and worthless edition,"The company who produced this book should be ashamed of themselves. And Amazon should not be selling such badly produced books. Here is a snippet.WE turned the corner of a ftreet, and I perceived in the midft of a fpacious place a circular temple crowned with a magnificent dome. this edifice, fupported by a fmgle range of columnes had four grand portals; on the front of each was written, The Temple of God. Time had already imprinted a venerable complexion on its wall, from which it received' and additional ma- jefty. When I arrived at the door of this temple, what was my furprife, to read the following lines in large characters:Loin""'-'<;;=.,1l.*While they do give a warning of possible mistakes in their process of digitilazing this book, this is simply not acceptable. Don't buy anything from General Books."
2,Not a Book - a Book-ette,"As a collector of Sherlock Holmes oriented works there is a certain expectation I have about the physical make-up of a book. It this is important to you as well, consider this a critical alert. When I received this printing I had to search to find it in the box - yes the book itself was small - though small does not conjure up the proper idea I am trying to communicate - I must call this printing a ""book-ette"". Good size for a child's doll house.The actual story, once I found it was solid. However, I believe in the total reading experience - the physical surroundings of the room, the weather, etc. This book-ette left me disappointed. If I could figure out how to get my money back I would."
5,"Weird and uncomfortable, Yet Awesome!!!","This is my favorite album by PH.It's very strange in the sense that it has a very ""attempt to be commercial"" sound to it, yet feels quite alone and disconnected from the mainstream of life.I imagine it is quite unappreciated by the majority of PH fans(not to mention the general public) who are trying to relive the old ""VDGG"" days.The atmosphere has quite a haunting feel to it, but still remains somehow friendly.The tones(sounds) that are used are great.This album is full of interesting rhythms and parts without being too ""out there"" for non musicians.I listen to it as if it were made today(rather than 20 years ago), that makes it more of a special experience.This is a work of Art.Grey Melcher"
