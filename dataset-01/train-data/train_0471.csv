5,Left Behind# 3,Bought the first book and it was so good that I ordered the rest of the series...you will love it
4,Finally Picks Up Again....,"Well I finally dragged thru the second book. #3 is a much more faster paced book, but I was expecting to learn more about Nicolae since this is the name of the book. It was more about the adventures of Buck, who seems to always get into stuff, but always makes it out. It is interesting to read how he does it. I am getting about sick of Chloe though, she's always nagging, whining, worrying and calling Buck at the most inappropriate times. Other than that a good read!"
1,Nicolae is a poor excuse for a villain.,"I'm sorry, but Nicolae is hardly the diabolical nemesis the antichrist is supposed to be. He feels more like a slick politician or a bureaucrat than the embodiment of evil. The villains in James Bond movies are far more sinister than this. Maybe it's because the authors are writing for a Christian audience that they feel that they have to sanitize their characters. You won't find a good characterization of evil here."
2,Don't bother buying the hardcover.,"As much as I liked the first one, the sequels are getting a little tiring. It seems like the authors have to recap everything that happened in the previous novels for anyone who picked up this one out of sequence. And I'm not sure these are worth buying brand new. Wait for the paperback, or borrow them from the library."
5,This book was amazing,"This book was worth 6 stars if they had given me a choice. It had a lot of action and suspence, and with all of that it kept me the whole weekend to read it. The books just keep getting better, and I am on hte first page of Soul Harvest. This book might be even more exciting than all of the other books."
3,Hooked,"I have just started this 3rd book and find it imposssible to stop. I will continue to the very last book. I am not a Christian and do not plan to be one, but I find these books very entertaining. Alot of the reviews I am reading are complaining about how these books dont follow the scriptures and that it is'nt realistic. I am just enjoying reading them. I am connected to the characters and want to see them succeed. I dont need to be a believer to read and I dont need to become one to enjoy this series. I feel sorry for those of you who can't just read it for the sake of reading, instead you have to tear it apart and discourage other possible readers to look elsewhere for a good book."
1,The keft behind series,I ordered this book way back in august and i have recieved the entire series but i still have not recieved this one yet and its october...i want my book!
3,Is the author high?,To much dialogue not enough action plain and simple. I never read a book with 70% of the text is conversation 5% action and 25% I can't even explain. All in all this is a difficult subject to tackle so kudos to the authors.
5,No Compromising!,"I loved this 3rd installation to the ""Left Behind"" series. What keeps me so interested is not the action scenes or sometimes long dialogue. It is the fact that the premise of the book is based on basic biblical Christian principals. We as Christians have been charged by God to spread the good news of the gospel and the authors, through their dialogue, allows an unsaved person to examine themsleves and say the sinners prayer if they feel led to do so, while at the same time entertaining them. Some may disagree with their stands, ie abortion, but if God said it (Bible) then we as Christians beleive it and do not have to apologize for it, alter it, compromise our stand, or be politically correct. I think the real point behind these books is that although entertaining to some, these events will happen because scripture tell us so. The question is, will you believe or will you be left behind."
5,NICOLAE,This is a wonderful addition to the Left Behind series. I enjoyed getting to know the enemy through the eyes of Tim LaHaye. I reccommend this series to anyone who is searching for answers to questions about Revelations.
3,A Little Quicker Paced Than The First Two,"The third book in the ""Left Behind"" series. Fast-paced novel which moves even quicker than the first two books. Some definite, well-written action - especially in the desert chase and evasion sections and the earthquake sections. The character development is slowed a bit with more emphasis placed on the action of the books - and on some rather preachy sections. Aside from those preachy sections (one disturbing section involves a rather slanted abortion view - but this is a book written by a pair of Right-Wing Christians, so what should one expect?), this particular book raises the bar from the first two. It will be quite interesting to see where the writing style will go, especially now that some action has been injected heavily into the storyline."
4,A good tool,"This book begins with the Tribulation Force recovering from the death of its mentor, and one of the team will save Tsion Ben-Judah. In this part of the series, the population must survive the first part of the seal judgments.The pace of the books in this series is fast. This book is no exception. I found myself caught up in the events and eagerly looking for the next book. I would recommend having the next book ready to read.The strength of this series is that it will increase your interest in the Book of Revelation. I think this a valuable tool and recommend it."
2,"10% Can't-put-it-down substance, 90% filler","I would have to rate Left Behind as one of my two favorite books of all time, a definite 10 rating. Tribulation Force certainly falls within my top ten favorites scoring at least an 8. Nicholae, however, seems to have dropped off greatly. It appears to me that the idea of a seven book series seems to be a novel idea (no pun intended), but after reading Nicholae, I'm afraid of more filling dialogue as opposed to the gripping action and suspense of the first book. I am still enough of a fan to continue to read the series but had I known what I know now, I would have gone to the book store and simply read Chapter 19 (and would not have missed out by doing so). I love the series but it appears to me to be a ploy to make twice the amount of money to tell a story that could be sufficiently be told in three (maybe four)."
1,"Left Behind, Tribulation Force...","I'm writing this review on the Nicolae page because I happened to land here. I have only read the first two books in the series--I quit on Nicolae. As a Christian I am embarrased by the poor writing in these books. The characters are so paper thin and unbelievable that I don't see how anyone can identify with them. The writers seem to have absolutely zero flair for capturing the range of emotions common to human beings and they have no talent for writing realistic dialogue. Even the non-Christians seem to come out of a Norman Rockwell painting. Really, really bad writing. Lame...very lame. If you want to read some good Christian novels, pick up ""Pontius Pilate"" and ""The Flames of Rome"" by Paul Maier; or some C.S. Lewis books like the Space Trilogy or The Screwtape Letters. They're not only thought provoking but they are skillfully written as well."
3,Characters still trapped in one dimensional hell,"The disheartening thing about ""Nicolae"" is that with all the attention these books have been getting, you'd think more time and care would be given to character development. This book, more than the first two really begins to paint a picture of what's morally right and wrong through chacters who speak like no one I've ever met. The woman are portrayed basically as weak willed puppets like Hattie, or an agressive angry lesbian like Vera. Chloe and Amanda spend most of the book worrying about their respective husbands who trudge forward like the Christian Indiana Jones. I will continue to read the books because I think it's an interesting way to explain the Rapture which I've always been interested in. I just keep thinking I wish the books were being written by people who could create realistic dialogue, & multifasceted people, not one dimensional stereotypes."
5,No More Mr. Nice Guy,"Everybody takes off the gloves in this one. Though the title would lead one to believe that the entire book is devoted to the development of one character, perhaps the most exciting sequences are given to Buck in this one. The action scenes are well thought-out and plausible. It has all the action and suspense of any current secular thriller.The only complaint I have is that the book had no ending. While Soul Harvest is already available, the first two books could stand by themselves, but chapter one of ""Harvest"" will be just an extension of this book.In this one, Jenkins has finally found his groove as an action and adventure writer, and its easy to get lost in this one. Great reading."
3,Nicolae: A Review of Left Behind...No Pun Inteneded!,"The reasoning for my ""no pun intended"" statement is because this addition to the Left Behind Series seemed more like a Rehashing of the previous two installments. As I read, I was waiting for more detail about the Tribulation to unfold, but the majority of the story seemed like a repeat of the personal lives of Rayford Steele, his daughter Chloe, and Buck. This may serve better to a reader that had not already have read the first two, but for readers that had previously just read the other two books, it deffinitly seemed to lag and was a disappointment.The fact of the matter is, that there is better religous fiction available then this, though is worth a read anyway."
2,"I found the third novel ""Nicolae"" to be a disappointment.","The main problem I had with ""Nicolae"" was that for the anti-christ, he was not very mean, or treacherous. I know some people who make this character seem like ""Mickey Mouse"". When the believers are persecuted, it's got to be really BAD. In America we have been blessed, and most individuals have not had to face heavy persecution. Perhaps this is why this novel is deficient in relation to persecution during the tribulation. Make it rougher- the anitchrist is supposed to ""wear out"" the saints of God. Inspite of my feelings about Nicolae, I am looking forward to reading Soul Harvest."
3,the rise of anticrist of nicolae crystal soignier,I like this book because it had to do with god and the devil. I love reading things about god. I love learning new thing about what mite go on or what has gone on in life. What I did not like about the book was that it did not explain that much about what happened. I think they could of explained it more than they did. I did not really understand it that well but it was pretty clear what was going on in the book. I watch the moves of the books. I will tells other people to read these books.
4,"Great books, but accurate?","I love all three of these books. Riveting story, great characters, couldn't put 'em down. But, something no one is mentioning: what if the rapture occurs AFTER the Tribulation? If so, lots of folks will be misled and disappointed. The church believed the rapture and the second coming would be at the end of the trib. for 1800 years! Virtually all of the church fathers thought so. Read 1 thess. and 2 thess., Matt. 24, and Rev. 20. It sounds like the rapture comes after the trib. And why are christians being warned in the bible about the antichrist, and trib. suffering etc. if it's something that they supposedly would never see? Check out Walter Martin's tape about the church and the Tribulation available from CRI at equip.org. And str.org has similar view. thanks."
3,"Shallow part 3 all cliffhangers, nothing else.","Beginning with a global thermonuclear war and ending with a massive earthquake, Jerry Jenkins third book in his Left Behind series continues a downward spiral of emphasizing action over character. Other quibbles are how unscathed just about everything seems to be after the war. I know that the Anti-Christ is supposed to appear as quite the miracle worker and all, but come on. A little greater attention to detail would be nice. The book is breathlessly paced and full of action and intrigue, but without a heavy dramatic anchor to hold the story for us it is hard to care too deeply about the characters and the upcoming perils they will face. As with Left Behind and Tribulation Force, Jenkins' ends this novel with a cliffhanger that will have hooked readers (of which I am one) anxiously awaiting the next volume, others may feel cheated."
4,Nicolae another great book,"The third book in this series was just as great as the others.As a gift last Christmas my friend gave me the entire Left Behind series and told me I should read it. I started out with the first and am slowly working my way into the series.In this book Buck, Rayford and there wives are still trying to find the answers they need. This book has it all the action, the adventure, the plot twists.Overall, this was a great book, and I can't wait to read the rest in the series."
3,good book,this is a good book. but sometimes I think the author is too repetitive of the contents from previous ones.
5,Will YOU be Left Behind?,"I am so thankful that this series was put into my life. What keeps me reading is how I can relate to the characters. Their reactions aren't phony, but so genuine that I realized that I don't want to be in the ""LEFT BEHIND"" situation. My favorite passage is half-way through ""Left Behind"" when Bruce Barnes is describing his life. He was the assistant pastor, who went to Bible College and was essentially ""Living the Lie/Life."" He was ""playing around the edges."" To me that was so powerful. So many people are assuming that they are ""Christians"" yet lacking the best and most important part ... A MEANINGFUL AND REAL RELATIONSHIP WITH JESUS CHRIST! Lacking this could very well mean you could be ""Left Behind."""
1,Open to God's Love,"""And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?""When I read the New Testament, I find a God of love and compassion. In these books I find a message of hate and fear. Why are so many eager to condemn those around them who don't believe exactly as you do? The history of early Christianity isn't one of a uniform understanding of Christ's message. If even those right after Christ couldn't get is right, why, on earth, do you believe that you understand the exact message of God? I would suggest we all work on bringing ourselves closer to God's love and spend less time imagining the punishment of those who don't conform to our idea of how God wants us to live"
5,A Good Book,Some of the graphics in the book are a little much but the author's don't call any punches and don't want to sugar coat anything. The story moves fast and holds your attention along with being well written. I enjoyed it.
3,Reads like a magazine article,I've read all 3 books and don't get me wrong I've enjoyed them but I was a little disappointed that it didn't move more quickly. I really wish there was more detail. I found it a bit predictible.
5,Earth Shakeing,"Got all 3 books Dec 25, they where so powerful and realistic, that you feel as if you are there. Should open any ones, heart, mind and soul, to the truth. Yes!!! Jesus is soon to come, and many will miss him. Cant wait for the next book in Aug.(they sure do write slow. LOL)"
1,A Romanian? Get real - a Romanian?,"The average reader probably knows only two things about Romania -it's the country of a fictional archfiend (Dracula) and the historical archfiend who inspired him (Vlad Trepes). You would that instead of picking further on this now improvrished country which is a threat to nobody Lahaye and LaHaye would have written about an antichrist with a background that gave his a mediocum of irony.Myself, I would have used a seemingly straightforward Texan who grew up in a political family surrounded by the power and influence of the energy industry, who had the enthusiastic backing of the wealthiest part of our country, the support of the all-powerful U.S. military, plus had millions of highly religious followers ready to snarl in defense of the man when the slightest criticism was applied...now *that* would be a believable Antichrist!"
4,"Nicolae: The Rise of Antichrist ( Left Behind, Book 3 )","Awesome, it makes a person think twice about whats going on in our world now of days with all sorts of thing coming to pass like the bible says. So great that it keeps a person wanting more."
3,Decent fiction masquerading as fact,"LaHaye and Jenkins will never win a Nobel Prize for literature, but their storytelling is fast-paced and creative. Here they continue to attempt to do the impossible, that is, write a book chronically what they feel the Biblical book of Revelations articulates. This is the third book of the ""Left Behind"" series doing just that. One point everyone must remember when reading this book. This is a human interpretation of what they think God was revealing in Revelations. There have been other interpretations and until God reveals more truths, no one can be sure of the full meaning of the book. As such, this series must be viewed as fiction, and in my opinion average fiction, at best."
3,Not the best,"I'm just going to say that I read the other two books in a matter of days, this one took me a week and a half. The beginning and the end were exciting, but the middle draaaaags and the writing is not the best I've ever seen. Simple things like repetitive descriptions within the same paragraph and dumb unnecessary descriptive clauses like ""Antichrist Himself"" used many many many times in the same chapter. I found these things annoying, but maybe that's because I'm an English Major. All in all, I'm glad I read it and I'm on to the next. I'd recommend reading this book if only for the chronology of the character's lives and what happens at the end. It's not as suspenseful as the second one was where you need to go from chapter to chapter because they all leave you hanging. However, good read..."
3,"Good story, but predictable. Leaves reader hanging.","I have mixed feelings. I read the book in two days. It is an easy read and a page turner. Similar style to first two books with a good story line. A little too much rehashing of material in previous books. Some exciting though somewhat predictable sequences. Won't win any awards for writing, but remains true to the Bible. Should have been combined into a longer book. Ending is definitely not satisfying.I recommend waiting for the paperback. Then you can read books three and four together."
4,it was good but not the best of the first three,The story was moving so easily after the second book so I was really looking forward to the thrid. It was great and had its moments where it really captured you up into the story with the chacters but the depth and description wasn't there. The couple page summary of the past books really bogged you down. The other thing that stood out was the fact that the title made you think that the anti-christ would be the main focus of the book but it wasn't at all. He didn't hardly even touch the subject of his future plans. I feel that I didn't learn anything about him as I was expecting to. Other than that the book was wonderful
5,What are you talking about?!! Definitely the best so far!,"This is definitely the best book of the series so far. The authors definitely have displayed incredible insight on the events of the end times. It's a marvelous interpretation of Revelation and should be taken at what it is; simply the authors' description of what end times could be like based on careful study of Revelation and prophecy. I have read ""The Last Day"" and it is also an incredible description of end time events, however, it should not be compared to the books of this series written by LaHaye and Jenkins. These books are extremely unique in their own right. My wife and I are proud to own the whole series and look forward to the next release."
3,Fading quality,"Maybe it's because I just read a great novel about WWII, The Triumph and the Glory, but Nicolae, which I read next, didn't do much for me. I really liked Left Behind, it was great! Tribulation Force was not quite as well done, but still OK. I was hoping Nicolae would redeem the series but it hasn't, it just seemed so contrived and forced."
5,A fantastic journey!,I commend the authors for writing this book. I could not put it down. I was hooked on the first book but the Series keeps getting better. I think this is the best so far. The characters are vivid and real. The plot is biblically based and it gives me an additional boose just knowing that I won't be left behind!
5,Excellent!!! I could not put it down...,"I never was much at reading the Bible, much less revelations, but after reading these books, I understand it so much better. It really shook me up. I have become a Christian just recently."
2,Sorely disappointing . . .,"The only readers who will come away satisfied with this series (I quit halfway through ""Soul Harvest"") are fundamentalist who can't get enough of the same ol' fire and brimstone. These books are the shallowest of shallow, with about as much intellectual stimulation as a bowl of cold oatmeal. There are vastly more exciting and fearsome novels on the subject of The Last Day--not the least of which is the novel by the same name--""The Last Day."" If you have the mental wherewithal for a really scary spiritual ride, ""The Last Day"" delivers a story of unsurpassed suspense and controversy. If you just like to sit back and veg out, stick with this juvenile ""Left Behind"" stuff!"
2,Poor format,"I found this book very frustrating from the sense of how it was written; the format if you will. The author ""profiles"" about 70 homes, but gives very little history on each home, and the most disappointing/frustrating aspect of this book was for all but a few homes there was only one, yes ONE photograph of the exterior. Simply put, there would be one exterior photo of the facade, a couple paragraphs of text, and on the next page, on to the next house! Gee thanks for that photo of a beautiful mansion. I sure wonder what the foyer or the formal dining room looks like, but I guess I'll have to just keep wondering!? It's simlpy astonishing that there is one exterior photo per house, and that's it. I believe the author would have been much better served focusing on each house more, discussing the history and providing several exterior shots of the home and grounds(including landscaping and gardens), as well as the interiors. If a book can underachieve, this one has."
1,Didn't work out...,"I bought this product as a gift for my boyfriend... and he hated it. It didn't so much tingle as burn. I guess if you or the person you plan on getting this for loves the sensation of IcyHot on their genitals, then this product if for you.It was so bad that I felt crappy for buying it for him. The rest of the Kama Sutra products I've bought have been exceptional however."
1,"If you like lies, this book is for you.","Firstly, I admit that I haven't read the whole thing, but not without good reason. I decided that this would be the first book in while I would actually look up the quotes that it makes since I have most of the sources.I don't think I even got past the first chapter but this book wasn't making sense on a logical level and a lot of the quotes either were changed or had some things added in them. I find it disgusting that a person should quote the Torah and change around the things it says to fulfill their own purpose.Even more so I became so disgusted about the things it said I HAD to make an online page for people to read the book in junction with my page. (...)In anycase, I don't advise buying this book, I will finish reading it at one point or another just to write my thoughts on it..."
5,A good start to enjoy contemporary cinema,"It's an extreme pleasure to view the art of four contemporary masters in one film. Especially Pasolini's ""La Ricota"" could be one of the best films made by this controversial Italian director. If you like to see some very funny, charming, delicate, yet profound artistic movies but don't want to spand too much time, check this one out!"
4,VERY FINE NOVEL,"This is a splendid novel about China during the Cultural Revolution. The author makes you care about the characters; from the first pages you are involved with the young girl who is the narrator and as the novel progresses you come to care about her, her best friend from the poorest class, and the other characters. Aside from the very interesting people in the novel, you also learn a lot about China during the Cultural Revolution. The author gives us a child's view of how Mao was literally worshipped as a revolutionary deity. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to ""get involved"" in a fascinating novel."
4,Not to bad,"Put together well, does not have that cheap feel to it like some others and the chrome shine is real nice. Can be a little difficult to install if you have fairly large hands."
4,Its a little too long but I like it,Took a minute to get used to it. It is pretty long and hits the floor but I am happy with it.
1,not good,Didn't fit the Mitsubishi Galant 2001 gas pedal. This gas pedal is not universal. Buy with caution and make sure you can return product.
5,"GOOD, GOOD Information !","I am in a women's investment group and we used Ms. King's book as a textbook--it was VERY HELPFUL. I would recommend it highly. After working through the book, we invited her to speak to our investment group (she lives about 150 miles from us). She came and we learned even more through her lecture.She will return and give us more information and even do a book signing."
3,T M T bringing hell on earth,"Too much trouble was one of the RAP-A-LOT groups of the early 90s they consisted of 'GHETTO MC','Drunk D','Bar None',and 'Bad News Black'.I consider the original ""bringinng Hell on Earth"" a classic.This one here is arap a lot chopped and screwed version. I cant say that rap a lot is great at chopping and screwing.It was OK but not great,I think this album should have been left alone THE ORIGINAL RECORDING was a bangin album."
5,Brings back memories!,"I got this album from my cousin, he didnt like it and pawned it off on me. I ended up loving it. I just ordered a copy just for nostalgic purposes. It brings back all kinds of memories of my teenage years."
1,Lame as hell,"A classic? Are you kidding me? This album is one of the lamest pieces of sh*t I've ever heard. Seriously, at this point int time Rap A Lot was putting out a lot of garbage for friends of the Geto Boys to ride their coat tails, ie, Too Much Trouble, The Terrorist, Gansta Nip. Geto Boys were great, but their friends who wanted a record deal based off of their name were some of the biggest no talent hacks I've ever heard in my life. Rap A Lot records tried to capitalize on their name and in my opinion ruined the overall reputation of the label. Generic as hell and just plain lame. I wonder how long they had to search the ghetto of 5th Ward to find a white midget to cop off the fame of Bushwick Bill...""if a midget is good enough for the geto boys, a midget is good enough for us...but let's make ours white so people won't think we're ripping them off""...since people won't know we're riding their coat tails by referring to ourselves as THE BABY GETO BOYS"
3,Good idea but ...,"I bought this cookbook based on the reviews I read here. While I love some of the ideas these recipes generate, I find that most of the recipes lack flavor. I understand that they were made with children in mind but I even have to add spice to suit my 18 month old's tastes. With this in mind, it might have been helpful if the authors had added notes on complementary spices that would punch the recipes up a bit."
3,Not all the quick,"I was dissapointed with this book. The meals are not that quick and easy. There is a good variety to choose from, and they look tasty, but I haven't made too many due to the complexity of the recipes."
2,Just doesn't taste good!,"Well, I really wanted to like this book. I read it like a novel then rolled up my sleeves to try some recipes... I ended up throwing a lot of food, as I couldn't get anybody else in my family to eat them! Even I could not bear to eat the leftovers. And the recipes weren't as quick and easy as I wanted. Maybe I'll have better luck with a cookbook by Jeanne Lemlin, which I will order next."
5,nene,they sound so good and can we have a fan club address and i also was wondering are they in a relationship with any one
5,"This song is absolutely ""off the chart"".","This song is absolutely ""off the chart"". I love it! Thanks, Ideal."
4,Nice Collection of Classics,This is a great starter set at a very reasonable price. Some of THE essential early gangster films. Highly recommended.
5,At last the great gangsters films are here on dvd!!,All the great gangsters films are now on dvd for all to enjoy!!I waited years for these films to get the proper dvd treatment with all the great extras!!Thank you Warner Bros.!!
2,One-time classic now dated,"I am a big Bogart fan but hadn't seen this movie in a while. I watched it and found it somewhat uninteresting and dated. The first 1/2 hour is mostly Leslie Howard and Bette Davis talking and flirting. By the time Bogie showed up, I'd just about lost interest. I'll watch other Bogart movies but I think I'm done with this one."
1,"BAD, BAD, BAD","Now I know why I never bought this; it looks boring and it is. A long, winding and unrealistic plot. How many times does a villian with a gun have to say, ""Sit down, shut up, move away from that door"" for the characters to respond..in the real world, all the hostages would be dead. There are no real high points and the plot does not really make sense. Leslie Howard's role is annoying and again unrealistic, and Bette Davis just rolls along on this disaster waiting to happen. I am typing this review as I am watching the DVD, for I couldn't wait until it was finished to say how bad it was....oops, it just ended; one would never guess that the ending would have been so rushed & anticlimactic. Do NOT buy this!!!!!!!"
5,Truly Great Screen Classics,"I can't add any new praise to the other reviewers...this set is just a delight from beginning to end. I am relearning just how amazing an actor Cagney was. What I will add is that when you watch these movies you see the building blocks of every gangster movie made since, before they became cliches. (A drinking game could me played requiring a shot whenever anyone says ""saaay...what's the idea?"") The featurettes are nice and the ""Warner Night at the Movies"" format is a lot of fun as well. This and Universal's package of its' classic monster movies are terrific entertainments as well as educations in the roots of each genre."
5,The Archetypical American Film,"If I was to choose one film to show a foreigner what America was REALLY all about, this would be it. It is all encompased by this one story, a national microcosm in a desert truck stop. Not only isn't it dated, but in some ways it seems that we are just catching back up to it. Leslie Howard gives his best lifetime performance as Alan Squire, a drifting, disillusioned combination of artist and intellectual. Betty Davis is perfect as the pure, unspoiled spark worthy of dieing for. And Humphrey Bogart as Duke, is the model anti-hero, a supposed mad-dog murderer with more soul than the creatures, and the system, certain to bring him down...."
3,Forced Drama and Typical Characters,"""The Petrified Forest"" is a mediocre movie. With names like Leslie Howard, Bette Davis, and (introducing) Humphrey Bogart, I was really expecting more. The one dimensional characters and run-of-the-mill script seemed to come together as a barely passable result with an ending that desperately tried to be something the rest of the movie just wasn't able to support. It held my interest just enough to finish it, but I have no desire to see it again. In my opinion, you're not missing anything should you never see this movie."
2,upset by it,"i'd like to warn people who like bogart and davis, who enjoyed movies such as ""all about eve"" or ""baby jane""; ""the dark passage"" ; just like i did. I just can't go through this one without being a bit bored honnestly ( this , with no offense to people who love this movie, it's just not my cup of tea and i was fearing that people sharing my tastes would buy it too and would be deceived as well)."
2,"Leslie is the star, but Humphrey's the cover guy? Strange...","I could sum this up in a very brief paragraph, and I will, because it simply did not thrill me to the depths of my soul, leaving me appropriately petrified.Bette Davis was fine. Leslie Howard is, as usual, a watery intellectual, this time turned hitchhiker. Humphrey Bogart is the tough guy whose entire role required little more than sitting pointing a gun at people. The others were unremarkable.This movie wants so much to live, and love, and be loved, but there is nothing to be found for it - not here nor anywhere else. It longs to be buried somewhere in the Petrified Forest, where the winds can blow over it, and perhaps - being so chocked full of dramatic, poetic statements, some will leak out from its grave, and the occasional tourist will hear the gentle whisper, ""'Tis for this end that we twain are met!""Let this movie rest in peace."
4,Fun collection,If you like some of the old movies you will like this collection. Very entertaining without a lot of explicit blood and guts and irrelevent sex in the new movies. Brings you back in time.
1,dont get the reissue,I just got my reissue copy of vision of misery and it turned out to be swallowed in black with the cover artwork for vision of misery and the cd print for vision of misery but the data on the cd is swallowed in black. I got screwed good. Get the original issue if you can!
3,"Half worth seeing, half not","About fifty-fifty composed of shorts worth seeing and shorts not worth seeing. The ones worth seeing aren't so good as to justify sitting through the ones that aren't, though."
2,Brine pump review.,I am a chef in Salt Lake City first of all with over 17 years experience in the restaurant industry. This brine pump does not work as well as the exact one it replaced. So i guess thats what happens. We use it every day multiple times and it just does not make me happy. I will be replacing this brine pump with another just like it because nobody makes a better brine pump than FDick.Jim
1,Disappointment,disappointing product. This is not the Daniel Green slipper I remember from the past. Not soft nor flexible. Very uncomfortable. Had to put foam insoles in to tolerate walking in them.
5,Quality Product,"Fits well, very stylish, excellent quality, the company offers a good selection, you cannot go wrong with a Daniel Green product."
3,Don't like the man-made sole!,"The shoe fits fine, but I need shoes with rubber soles as i am handicapped.Daniel Green Women's Meg SlipperI hope Daniel Green has a slipper that has a rubber sole. I ordered the product from Amazon."
5,good product,"bought these for my mom as a gift -- she loves them. She wears them more as a house shoe than a slipper, because they have more support than a slipper."
2,WIDTH is SO wrong!,"Due to a recent injury, and a very swollen foot, I ordered WW width. I was hoping to have something that I could get on my foot, since this will take a long time to heal. The slippers that came are actually more narrow than a regular width! The box label says WW but they are FAR far from it. I am NOT impressed. BEWARE!"
3,Not for high instep,Had to return this slipper as I have a high instep and they did not fit. Seemed like nice quality but didn't work for me.
2,bedroom slipper,the quality of these slippers is most disappointing. i do not recommend them.i was very please with amazon's process and will use again
3,Hard sole,"I had to return these slippers, though they were good in all ways but one. The sole and heel were as hard as walking on concrete and with joint replacements, I need a softer, bouncier sole."
2,Disappointing,"After wearing them only once or twice, these slippers required repair. The insole came apart from the sole itself and needed gluing. At the price charged for these slippers, and given the company's reputation, I expected much higher quality and a reasonable period of problem-free wear."
4,More than needed,"This item was worth it, My wife was looking everywhere but it is allot but we hope it wont spoil"
4,very readable; engrossing;,"Spence picks up some loose ends Donelly could not tie in his book 'Atlantis'. Explanations for the pre-atlantean giants, antediluvians, and the subsequent diaspora. If you are interested in 'factual' Atlantis, or theoretical History, then you should get this book."
1,Wireless Mini Mouse Prove to be Junk!,"This is a poorly made mouse with lots of issues. Simply junk! After opening the mouse to insert batteries, I could not get the mouse to click correctly. JUNK! Beware! The seller was able to refund my money in full."
2,Be Very Wary - - - of this book,I agree totally with Cynthia (first reviewer). These are some of the most one dimensional characters I've ever read. Parts of the story where vaguely interesting and could have developed into a reasonable mystery - but you had to slog through the main characters' constant reminiscences to get there. It would have been a welcome relief if the serial killer had knocked off Liz and Jake about one third the way through.
1,cheated,"Dear sir, madam,Indeed I purchased this cd, thinking it would be good. Unfortunately I feel very much cheated because it holds no R.O. nor L.R. sung music. To me they are bad imitations. I already mentioned this to you at Amazon when I had to rate this product and so far I did not receive any answer. Once again, It was only a couple of dollars buy but I would have appreciated any suggestion from you as what to do with this cd."
2,Difficult,"Who said such was a ""Classic"" .. notes are helpful but for a Freshman in HS, it is difficult to totally coordinate between notes and book."
1,It's a floater,Tried everything to keep this filter from floating. Finally pulled it after 3 weeks of no success. Is there a perfect filter out there?
3,Good...but not great,"As others have mentioned, the photos are great. They do a great job of showing the state and conditions of sports car racing at the time. So if the photos are great, why only three stars?Because the content beyond that is really light. I'm too young to have seen these cars the first time(36 now) but have seen many of them at vintage events. While pictures of a field full of three different types of Lotus are enjoyable to look at, there's no explanation as to what makes them different. The same is true for all the marques. Also missing is much detail from or about the drivers and teams.Finally, the book has a decided West Coast bias. I've been to Road Atlanta several times and live a short drive from Road America but found few photos from either of these tracks.It's not bad, but you'll need some other reference material to fill in the dead air around the great images."
5,Excellent package!!!,"Our American Legion Post uses these for our Memorial Day Avenue of Flags and have done so for many years now, we just keep adding flags and poles. I ordered three of these, two are identical and real heavy gauge poles, but the third one is much lighter gauge steel, still a good buy, but I would prefer all to be the same heavier gauge. All have the same model number and identical packaging."
4,A fun record by a band I'd never heard of before,"I took a chance on these guys based on a review in Blues Access Magazine. I'm glad I did. Has a real raw, upbeat boogie, almost rockabilly feel and the lyrics are a blast. Sounds like they'd be a lot of fun to see live."
5,A Book To Warm Your Heart,"This book arrived from amazon and was read cover to cover all in one evening. It's a tiny volume, easy to read. Each little chapter is an aphorism about God, based on a verse of Scripture, with a brief personalized comment by the author. In some cases she will share a longer anecdote from her life, and in doing so she always reveals something very vulnerable and touching about herself. This is a very sweet book but it also has a depth that comes from the author's real struggles and heartaches. It is real without being preachy or the least bit solemn. You need to read this book!"
4,Great message on release. Metaphorically right on.,"This book is metaphorically right on in regards to releasing the thing(s) that keep you wound up, things that hinder your worship and relationships."
1,Be careful...this is a pricey sets of ordinary essays,This is a set of essays and we purchased it thinking it is by Ms. Sue Monk Kidd. she only wrote the commentary. Quite a pricey mistake
3,With Open Hands,"When I read this book many years ago, it left a lasting impression on me. I ordered a copy for my own library. This time, the photos seemed dated, although the text was still significant.My greatest disappointment is that I bought it as an Amazon used book, and the seller did not mention a personalized inscription on the opening page...argghh. I prefer clean books. So my complaint is about the re-seller not the author of the book."
5,The Standard on the Subject,"This extremely dense text is still head and shoulders above other contenders as the standard history of the rise and history of the roman empire. The authors thesis, that Rome never truly fell but evolved into the catholic church/feudal state is well defended with ample evidence.What makes this book so extraordinary is the depth and breath of the subject matter covered. Military history, politics, technology, art, science, social development, trade, are all given ample coverage. While it can be quite dry, the reader is free to skip around reading only the subjects of interest. For the scholar or the curious, this is a must own text that will serve as a crucial guide and reference."
4,Better than BJD,"It has been a year after reading the BJD books before reading this one, as I thought it might not be as interesting and fun. I must say Cause Celeb has more depth than the other two books, it got me thinking about how the difficult it is for the refugees to just to survive and how these camps might be like. Really enjoyed it cos it has a thinking (or sort of) and an independent heroine, instead of the seemingly forever dependent-on-men Bridget (though I like BJD too). Rosie is more realistic and knows her mind, whereas Bridget just seem too unreal and self-absorbed. There just one thing about cause celeb that I am unsatisfied-------Rosie's new relationship. It was not mentioned much unlike the Darcy-Jones relationship in BJD. Hmm, was just hoping for more.On the whole, this is a more touching and deeper book."
2,It's not what i have expected from Fielding,The book is a bit disappointing. A bit of inconsistency in the actions of the story' heroine. The part that describes Africa's refugee camp is more or less fine but still is a boring thing to read...I wouldn't recommend buying this book and if you think it's written in the BJ manner - you are wrong.Olga
3,Kind of boring!,"I am a huge fan of the Bridget Jones books. This is clearly not Bridget Jones. It took me awhile to get into the story and a lot of the book felt like it was plodding along. I felt as if I had to force myself to finish certain chapters, which is not a good sign! I never actually finished the book - I left a chapter or two unread. I just couldn't force myself to finish it."
3,Not as good as Bridget,"This book was not as good as bridget jones but an ok read. Near the end it gets very slow and I skimmed a lot. Overall I'm glad I read it, but I won't revisit it like I will Bridget Jones."
2,Unpleasantly Surprised...,"I feel like there should have been a warning on the cover ""This is NOT like Bridget Jones"" rather than all the Bridget comparisons. It's not a bad book - it's just not what I expected, and not what I would have chosen to read. It was too crass to mesh Rosies two worlds. I felt the book mocked the starvation issue."
1,UGH,"As a major fan of the Bridget Jones books, I didn't think it possible for Helen Fielding to write a bad book. She proved me wrong. So wrong, I could not finish it. Ugh."
3,Not the Next Bridget Jones,"Don't go into this novel expecting another Bridget Jones. While a lot of the same ingredients are there -- boorish men, flighty yet appealing women, and star-crossed lovers -- that's where the similarities end. Cause Celeb is more a wake-up call intending to make the public aware of the need for continued support of African famine relief than it is a love story. There are comedic elements, but I cried more than I laughed."
2,What a let down...,"After having listened to both Bridget Jones novels (beautifully read by Tracie Bennett), Cause Celeb was a huge let down. It was the anti-Bridget Jones. The subject matter was heavy and the story was often times boring. Worse still, was Bernadette Quigley's narration....extremely bland."
1,"Major disappointment, characters weak & undeveloped","Having read Bridget Jones & Fielding's lastest novel I was excited to read Cause Celeb. From the very beginning I was disappointed. The lead character is not really developed & she makes choice that I cannot understand or respect. She ended up driving me nuts, as did almost every character in the book. The dialogue for certain characters, like Nadia & Andre, was very annoying & was hard to read smoothly. There is also very little humor or romance in this book. While you feel for the refugee story the rest of it is pure cr*p and should be avoided."
2,Bridget Jones goes to Africa,"Ever wonder what it would be like if Bridget Jones got a job in an African refuge camp during a famine? Wonder no more! This is a valiant attempt to juxtapose the life of celebrities in London with starving masses in Africa, and the crassness of the celebrity-charity culture, but it just doesn't work. A proto-Bridget-Jones character has a bad relationship, so the logical thing to do is to became the administrator of an African refuge camp (???). I think it would have been more effective if the book just stayed in London, because the parts in Africa are contrived and pat."
4,"Not Bridget, but just as good","This book is not another Bridget Jones slapstick funny type book, but it is a solid good read and an interesting story.I read this book in about a day after seeing it in a local bookstore. After plowing through it, I am certainly looking forward to Helen Fielding's next book, whatever it may be about.I highly reccomend this, it is kind of like John Grisham's Time to Kill versus the Firm. Two different kinds of stories, but both good."
3,"Very good book, interesting topic","Althought it is not as funny as Bridget Jones stories, it is a very good book. I found it hard to stop reading. The author clearly knows facts about the topic and uses her own experience from stay in Africa. I really liked it!"
4,Something to tide me over...,"After gobbling down The Edge of Reason I was curious to read Fielding's first novel, and hoping to re-experience some of the style I so enjoyed (actually, loved!) with Bridget. Cause Celeb fits the bill. While the protagonist is a less-extreme Bridget, more sure of herself in general, you can see Bridget's roots in Rosie and Fielding's style evolving. While the Bridget books are, let's face it, poor, unbridled silliness (Hurrah! What fun!), Cause Celeb has more of a social conscience, not only regarding the plight of Africa but with Rosie herself acknowledging she is worthy of more than being a doormat for the lunacy of a man. And, the best thing, tho superfluous...it's a slower read than Bridget, delaying the inevitable ""What do I read now?"" feeling! Keep 'em coming, Helen! Mmmmmm..."
3,_Almost_ as good as Bridget Jones . . .,"After a desperately awful blind date I reread Bridget Jones' Diary (very therapeutic) and then went in search of more Helen Fielding. I liked Cause Celebre, particularly the interactions between Rosie Richardson and the diabolical Oliver. The depiction of the African famine is interesting and unsentimental. The book isn't as tight or as confident as Bridget Jones, but it's a hell of a first novel. I wait impatiently for Fielding's next book."
4,Harder to read than BJ but more rewarding,"There are big warnings that this is not a BJ book, and whoever missed those has no one to blame but herself. That's exactly what you should expect - not a BJ book. I was finally relieved to see the heroine shed her BJ ways, although not completely convincingly. What was very convincing was the depiction of the camp, starvation, bureaucracy-ridden organizations; Fielding did obviously plenty of research."
4,Fine stuff,"This book is what I would have liked to have earlier for mylectures. In spite of being comprehensive, it gives not onlya good overview about the physics and current computationalmethods of the various fields of ship-related hydrodynamics,but contains also a host of valuable ideas which are not wellknown, and it concentrates on the important aspects withineach field. Many exercises show how to apply the facts andmethods to practical problems.A difficulty relates to viscous flow computations: Here specificmethods for naval architecture are hardly required; thus thisfield is handled superficially only. For all other topics Iknow of no other book of comparable quality."
5,Grooovin good record,"Excellent record. The whole record has what I can only call a ""happy bounce"". Groovy versions of 'My Cello' and 'The Piano has Been Drinking (not me)' bring a smile to my face. I dare you to listen to this record and not snap your fingers, tap your toes, or move your whole body. I got this record three days ago and can't stop singing to myself. I love it! Also, I highly recommend his recent album Beatin' the Heat, which I picked up on a whim, and has become my favorite record(and many of my friends and family's also!).This guy is one mellow, cool cat."
2,Ho-Hum Boooooorrrrrrriiiiinnnnnggggg!,Boring is a compliment. Dan is an accomplished musician but this isnot one of his finest collections. 'Nuff said. Go with his earlier stuff and forgt the live performance.
5,the best lyrics from Gangstarr since '89,"If you don't have this album, you should order it, cause it's DoPe. Dj prem' dj'n and Guru flippin' your a** with their own way of expression. Danm good album."
5,buy it right now,premier is the best dj in hip hop and guru won't let you down either. this album must be bought immediately. full clip is a song unequaled in 99 and the album is indispensible. that's all. go buy it. and crank it. peace.
5,HOLY S**T WHAT A GREAT ALBUM!,"This album has only one word that can describe it, UNDESCRIBABLE. ""Full clip"" is possibly the best rap song of '99, yet it's WAY too underplayed. This song deserves WAY more recognition, as does the whole CD, nobody really talked about it, but it deserves to be the most talked about album of the year. I'd never really heard GangStarr's music before this album came out, but I was making a big mistake. I should've started listening to these guys earlier cuz they're frickin AMAZING. Listen to the son Full Clip and you'll know what the f**k I'm talkin about!"
5,Almost Everything A Gang Starr Fan Could Ask For,"Gang Starr's Full Clip has just about every notable song the duo has made. This double album also features many hard-to-find b-sides and remixes for the collector. The production is amazing and Guru never goes wrong on the mic. Check out all of the classics: ""Mass Appeal"", ""Just To Get A Rep (version with an extra verse)"", ""You Know My Steez"", ""Words I Manifest (Remix)"", ""DWYCK"", ""The ? Remainz"", ""Take It Personal"", etc. All of the new tracks are top-notch too. The only songs that I believe should have been on here that are missing are ""Love Sick"", ""Doe In Advance"", ""2 Deep"", and ""Sucka's Need Bodyguards"". Otherwise, this compilation is perfect. If you don't own any Gang Starr, let this introduce you to one of hip-hop's greatest groups."
1,This book is dangerous nonsense!,As a result of reading this book I went to a clinical ecoligist in New York City. He was affiliated with a major upper east side hopital so I felt he should be legitimate. He gave me dilutions of chemicals including formaldehyde both by intradermal injection and sublingualy. After 3 month of this treatment my I could no longer work my blood test doubled in the allergic indicater Ige ( the highest any allergist I seen has ever encounter). I found out from the Office of professional medical conduct and the FDA that clinical ecology is quackery. In forty years these guys have been unable to show one double blind study proving the effacy of their treatment. The quack who teated me is currently under investigation. Before you try any of this nonsense I strongly urg you to check with the FDA or your local Health Department.

3,...until the novelty wears off.,"Ok, I'll admit I smiled when I opened up the little package this came it. Mr. Snot-A-Mug is whimsical, and it works. However it still suffers the limitations of just about every other egg-separator out there: you can only separate one egg at a time. While it looks like you could put three or four eggs in at once, the separator holes (i.e., nostrils) are set rather low (I guess which makes sense anatomically) which means in reality at most you can put two eggs in at the same time. And even then, you won't get a complete egg separation. Since the holes are in the nose which protrudes outward, every time you tip the rig to separate the yolks slide into the nose and block the holes (congestion?). There's always some white left! Oh well, it works, it looks funny, and the wife likes it, so...win?"
5,Neat item,"This is a cool item for the fun hearted cook. It is a great egg separater, and fun to use. Just crack the egg in it, the yolk stays in, while the egg white runs out the nose holes. If the white is cold, it comes out in a slimey glob, room temperature and it comes out fast.This product is fun and useful. I recomend it for the young cook in your life, or the fun seeking grandma who likes to show off to the grandkids."
4,Great introduction to perspective drawing.,"The illustrations are pretty small and not in color. But if you take the time to read through it, this book actually does a nice job of explaining the subject. Other books I've read just show you how to construct vanishing points, measuring points, etc. But this book actually does a decent job of explaining why these constructions work. It has given me an deeper understanding which makes all the techniques much easier to remember and apply. Highly recommended for anyone serious about learning to draw in perspective."
5,The best book on the subject I have yet seen,"This takes you way beyond anything I've yet read on the subject of drawing perspective. I'd say maybe 75% towards really understanding, (most references go maybe 10 - 25% into it.) It has a lot more applications than the illustrations might suggest, for example, the tiled courtyard with crossing, descending steps might easily translate into a river or cascading stream. The book only hints at panoramic perspective, that is, when you turn your head to view something to the side, you shift you center of vision, creating additional vanishing points. Intriguing."
1,not fit on Audi at all,same as abve it cant fit on my car Audi 2003 tt even when I put it it drub and can do an accident.
1,DON' T BUY,THIS WAS A VERY CHEAP UNSAFE PRODUCT. I CANNOT BELIEVE ANYONE WOULD STOCK SUCH A PEDAL. THIS LOOKED LIKE SOMETHING YOU MIGHT BUY AT A FLEA MARKET OR GET AT A LAWNFATE. IF YOU WERE TO INSTALL THESE THEY WOULD COME OFF WHILE YOU WERE DRIVING AND CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.
3,Dark Horse by B. M. Bower,"Description from the back of the book:When Big Medicine saved the strange rider who had been struck by lightning, he was something of a hero among the cowhands of the Flying U. But not for long. The stranger had amnesia and couldn't remember who he was, so they called him Nameless. He also had been exposed to smallpox so the whole ranch was put in quarantine. When red-headed, flirtatious Myrtle Forsyth was quarantined with the others, smallpox became a mild danger by comparison, as TheNative Son and Nameless both had eyes for her. Suddenly, it seemed, the Flying U's happy family was falling apart. Finally, the stranger was identified as Lopin' Larry Jones, a whirwind track star from the Coast, and the ranch became a secret training ground. Threatened on race day by a dirty double-cross, Big Medicine saves the day and reunites the Flying U again."
4,Ordered the whong shade,"But it was a great product. i didnt know how to use it at first, but i got the hang of it, and it's a lovely product"
4,Love this powder,"I've always been a fan of compacted and loose powders. I've been through so many and when I found this I couldn't resist. It gives great coverage without looking powdery. I've always large pores and this product hides them really well. It's great for setting my foundation and the color flesh matches me perfectly. The only reason this is a four out of five, is the container. As soon as I opened it I got the powder everywhere. Still it was worth every penny!"
5,Im In Love....,I seriously LOVE this powder its the best and it leaves my face so soft and natural looking.. I hope amazon will always have it so can buy more in the future cause everywere else this powder is discontinued... <33333
1,Nomads from Kashmir,I want to whole story about the nomads of Kashmir I would like to write about them. Please You can help me about my requirement. Complete thesis on Kashmir's Nomad
5,Water Pills Tabs,"This pill works well as long as you don't become dependent on it as a diet aid, as it is just what it says it is...a water pill. I took it on days that my fingers were tight and by the next day most of the water was gone and my fingers were'nt little sausages!"
3,Pretty good even if I was skeptical at first,"This was actually a lot better in the end than I thought it would be. When I picked it up off the shelf and glanced at the preview, I didn't read it thoroughly, and when I got into two or three chapters I was pretty skeptical. It turned out to be very good, excellent in its outcome, and worth reading."
4,great soundtrack,"A terrific soundtrack featuring excellent exclusive songs by Ice Cube, The Click, Too Short and UGK. B-Legit's and Spice 1's songs appear on their own respective albums."
4,yeeaahh,"The only reason I bought this is for the track ""Alright"" which is from Too Short and UGK. Smoke somethin', B---h!!!"
3,Not the best hip-hop soundtrack around,"The 'Big Names' on this CD make it worth buying it. Ice Cube's The World Is Mine is a good track and sounds somewhat like he would sound on his War & Peace-duo recording, Jay-Z's You're Only A Customer (Roc-a-fella y'all!) is cool and Keith Murray's Dangerous Ground is a good one. Furthermore KRS-One delivers a cool track, Perhaps She'll Die that sounds nothing like he's ever done before. The rest....well, that's just the rest."

1,Bogus testimonial,"In 1992, Mike Warnke is uncovered as a sham with a fabricated story. Shortly after, the IRS revoked his tax exempt status when the multi-million dollar salaries he was paying himself and his family members was revealed. Warnke thereafter went on ""hiatus"" until a few years ago, when he re-emerged playing much smaller (and presumably less-ethical) venues. While the humor on this CD is OK, it's hard to get around the fact that he was lying all along about his involvement with the occult. Lies never further the truth!"
1,Gadzooks! My purse purloined by ren-faire poseurs!,"This album doesn't suffer a lack of talent as far as musicianship goes. Tracks #6 and #16 are good and show what this album could've been. The problem lies in the songwriting, arranging and production. This is NOT Rennaissance music! I'm not sure what it is trying to be, but it fails miserably. Ms. Night has a lovely voice, but she doesn't really stretch herself. After the first couple of songs, her singing becomes tedious. Rock rhythms, synth bass lines and the excessive doubling and reverb on the vocals not to mention the weak lyrics and songwriting really disappointed me."
1,Really Lame,I thought this was a terrible album. The singing was pedestrian and the music sounded like the soundtrack to an episode of He-Man. Not just a waste of time but of money. Guitar playing is uninspired and has almost nothing to do with the musical forms that supposedly inspired this outing. For a real flavor of this type of music I would check out the Century Classics series from DHM.
5,Excellent album,"Again, Blackmore's Night out do themselves. The title song ""Under a Violet Moon"" seems to take you on a journey from the present to the past.Another must have for any Blackmore's Night fan."
4,Tight and polished.,"Once ""Under a Violet Moon"" made it into my CD player, it didn't want to leave. Although there are a few throw-away tunes here, the album overall is quite excellent. Blackmore's Night has filled the CD with less familiar traditionals and several very good original pieces. Even the traditionals are cunningly arranged to elicit a fresh sound, with just enough modern influences to set the band apart from the crowd."
2,"Just slightly better than ""Shadow...""","This CD is only *slightly* better than ""Shadow of The Moon"". To repeat my opinion about Blacmore's Night efforts: it's a sentimental and not very skillful stylization for early music. Apparently Blackmore is a very good guitar player, but his skills as a composer (esp. concerning melodies) are somewhat questionable. I wouldn't mind this album if it didn't pretend to be something it isn't - a modern interpretation of an early music. It's just some ""romantic"" pop. And finally, if you really like ""Past Time with Good Company"", give ""Pastime with Good Company"" by Gryphon and ""King Henry's Madrigal"" by Jethro Tull a listen - and see which one you like the most."
4,"Romantic,poetic...a great album.","Ritchie Blackmore has always been known as a guitar god;'Under a Violet Moon'introduces Ritchie the poet,the minstrel and the troubadour.This is a one of a kind trip,an excursion into magic and poetry-for this one you will need some good wine,true friends and companions,incense and candle light!"
4,Under a Violet Moon,"I didn't care for this album as much as ""Ghost of a Rose"" and Shadow of the Moon"" although I still liked it. Hard to describe in other than my global impression."
4,Shadow of the Moon is better,"But Under A Violet Moon is still far better than the tripe we get fed day in and day out on the radio. Ritchie is the king, and Candice has an enchanting voice. I can listen to their music day after day and never get bored with it."
4,Melodic and wonderfully constructed music!!!,"Ritchie and crew have put together another winner. I really like this ""new"" style of music for Ritchie, although he has always had minstrel music influence his work in Deep Purple, Rainbow, etc...I found this CD has enjoyable as Shadow..., and the recording was just as high of quality. A relaxing piece of music, you won't be disappointed if you purchase this."
5,Great effort from Mr. Blackmore,"A Great pice of work. Different from""Shadow..."" but still the same.Each song so different, so manymoods, melodies and ideas, and that iswhy i dont have a favorite song.They all are so GOOD. One of Blackmore' best albums."
5,Bushwick Bill's canibalistic recipe's all here!,"A brilliant collection of classics, if not a consistent album... from the disturbing horror-rap of ""Chuckie"", to the titilating erotica of ""The Other Level"" (though feminists will understandably object to that one), to the radical political stance of ""[screw] a War"" to the hilarious over-the-top rage of ""Homie Don't Play That"", through to the tragic fatalism on ""My Mind Playing Tricks On Me""..... Get it!!"
5,Good,Of course you have to get this CD if you are a Scarface/Geto Boys fan like I am. It's pretty good.
2,Ignore what the first guy said,"First off, being a fan of Screwed and Chopped music, its sad to say that a classic album was destroyed this time, and OG Ron C did not do this album, I never heard of this cat who did this one. Only reason it got 2 stars from me is because of the Name, it could have been chopped better, no blends, its sorry."
4,Good Set,"this is a good disc.Scarface,Bushwick Bill&Willie D. set the stage right on cuts like Chuckie&Tricks.but the classic Jam Mind Playing tricks on me is timeless.Before No-Limit,Cash Money,Outkast,Goodie mob,&Many Others Down South they were The Ground Breakers."
3,A good place to start,"If you're curious about Saucy Jack, this book and the one by Sugden are the places to start. The contributions by various Ripperologists that conclude this collection will convince you that there are two or three Ripper ""experts"" as loonie as the Ripper himself. The one fact I away with from reading this book that I had not previously realized was that there were probably 100 males living within a couple of blocks of the sites of the Ripper crimes, all working men who would normally be on the street at the time of the crimes, who had all the background ""qualifications"" of the modern serial killer. So what are the odds the actual Ripper has ever been named or suspected by anyone?"
2,Filled with Half-Baked theories and Poor Arguments,"Embodies a series of essays on ripper suspects that prove generally poor in analysis with a lack of any substantial or indepth counter-arguments. Anyone who has studied the Ripper case can easily pick up on how the author of each essay leaves out the evidence that doesn't fit his/her suspect.Just about all of these suspects have been much more intelligently discussed and the evidence for their being the Ripper all but dismissed in Sudgen's excellent ""The complete History of Jack the Ripper"" and Begg's et al ""Jack the Ripper A-Z"
2,A Disappointing Tome,"Althought this book is replete with details about the ripper victims and their post-mortems the presentation is so dry and clinical you may want to use this book as replacement for counting sheep. There isn't much here to whet the appetite but if you're interested in ""just the facts"" by all means pick this one up. If on the other hand you're more interested in something imaginative or entertaining pass on this one."
5,So worth the money.,"I had ordered the Tech Force 89 from Compasseco but sent it back. The rifle was for myself and my wife to target practice with at camp. However, it was simply too heavy and difficult to cock. So, I called the folks at Compassaco and arraigned an exchange for the Tech Force 97.We could not be happier. They sent the new rifle with no problems and this thing is a real gem. Like the 89 the wood is beautiful and the rifle fires true, it's well made and an absolute steal for the money. Unlike the 89 however, it's a breeze to cock and shoot and lighter to handle. The only negative is not with the rifle but the clearance loading pellets if you have a scope. It's not impossible to do but I just wish there was a little more room for the fingers to do it.Still, for the giveaway price for this pellet rifle compared to the Daisy's plastic handle toy for the same price it's a no brainier. You'll be happy with your purchase."
2,poor workmanship,The workmanship on this gun was poor. When I received the gun a screw was missing in the stock. The plugs for the front sight fell off within the first day of owning the gun. I expected better workmanship.
1,Disappointed,I purchased this item as a gift. Imagine my disappointment when the item did not work! I returned it. I have better things to say about the return process than the purchase. The response was immediate and complete.
1,Soap Dispenser,The product was delivered promptly and was as described except it is a flimsy piece of junk. Save your money.
1,Disappointed customer,The product simply did not work. We tried two sets of brand new batteries and we could not get the soap or the lotion to even begin to flow. We added a little bit of water thinking that maybe that would help it along--it barely flowed. We returned the products (I bought two).
3,Informs the reader about media literacy,"I liked this book. I read it for a class, but really took in the purpose of the book.That is, for people to become aware of the importance of media literacy. 3 stars."
4,Somewhat dry but very enlightening,It's a small book so the fact that it is a bit dry at times is easily countered by it's brevity. Quite enlightening to understand some of the historical culture to then apply to reading the New Testament.
1,don't waste your money,"The only good songs are the ones by the late grat Luther Vandross( if this world were mine), back in the day, and i wannna know. the teddy pendergrass song( you're my latest greatest inspiration)-you know the one played when taye diggs and lisaraye were married or something-wasn't even included in the soundtrack. BOO!!"
3,"Yeah, it was slightly poopy.","The first track is way cool, then there's some poopoo tracks like R. Kelley who needs to I don't know do something about his yodeling, and then Back in the Day was kickin and then bleah. It would have been worth, like, two dollars."
4,The album is O.K.,You should have included Teddy Pendergrass's song on the soundtrack. I would have brought the soundtrack. That song brought back memories for the older group that went to see the movie. We can't remember the name of the song. But it made the wedding special.
3,too $hort you fool,"three stars. one for the greatest ever, too $heezy, and one for dre and big boi. both of their songs are phat. f mystikal, he sucks."
2,it was just Aight,"this Soundtrack had cuts from R.kelly,The Roots,Outkast,&other folks along with Classics from back in the day but overall Ahmad stole the soundtrack.other than that not much to really speak on.it was just aight to me.still dig the film though."
3,"Fair soundtrack, several good songs, several bad","My review is right in the middle because if you average off all the songs thats wut it is. Anyway, my fav tracks are, of course, the roots ""Y'all Know Who"", cause any roots song is tight if u's a fan, ""Neck Uv Da Woods"" isnt up there lyrical, but its got a dope beat so i give it some credit, ""I Wanna Know"" by Case and ""Think about You"" by Blackstreet, both very smooth tracks, the adequate R. Kelly songnd of course the classic Biz Markie track ""Make the Music w/your mouth Biz"". Some disappointments were the DMX track (HE MUST HAVE BEEN DRUNK WITH THOSE LYRICS!), the Cash Money song and a bunch of tracks by unknowns. It has several good songs, but dont look for a masterpiece here. Peace."
3,Hmmmmmm,"This CD was a disappointment. It didn't have all the songs that were played in the actual movie. I've put it away and rearely listen to it,,,,,,,,,,,,Sad, cuz I TRULY loved the movie!!!!!!!"
4,This album is knockin.,"THis album is knockin. It's got a lil sumthin sumthin for everyone. The song wit mystikal and outkast is a long awaited collabo, and the songs by R. Kelly and Too short are not to be overlooked. Overall it's one of the better soundtracks to come out in a long time."
1,Two Words: HATED IT,"If it wasn't for AHMAD's effort on this CD, it would have been a total waste of my hard earned money."
5,Good CD!,This CD brings you back to the day for a majority of us who were coming up during this time. It was a good CD! It does the movie justice since the movie was a good one as well.
1,Versatile vibrator,"The title says it all. Another reviewer made a snide comment to this effect and he's probably right. I can't believe that it's advertised as ""ultrasonic""... because it's not. It just vibrates. And there's more vibration at the base than on the brush head."
1,Poorly made,It is cheaply constructed. It is not water-proof. The batteries inside the battery compartment are wet after first use. Not recommended!
1,Returned product,The battery compartment on the product would not remain closed. It is cheaply constructed and totally unsatisfactory.
4,Not Too Shabby,I have been a Battletech fan since I bought MechWarrior 2 and have never stopped enjoying the different aspects of the Battletech universe. The RPG brings a new dimension to this series and this box set is and item no Battletech fan should be without. Even if you don't like the RPG the minatures are really cool. I hope you have fun with this set.
3,Good book until the end.,"I was really enjoying Nest of Vipers until the last 50 pages. The ending was unoriginal and boring, ruining a plot that had real potential. Same situation with the main character. A good protagonist ruined by a lousy ending. The author shouldn't of rushed to complete the ending. The book would have been a lot better."
2,Not so hot.,"This book features Sarah Jensen, a young, gorgeous, exceedingly bright (When are we going to have a book about an ugly, old not-so-bright heroine?) currency trader who is asked by the British version of the Federal Reserve President to go undercover at a trading house and see if they are using inside information to make millions of pounds. Much trouble ensues.The female lead is a little too well-connected (she always knows just the right person to help her when she needs something) and I was kind of bugged that the characters used dollars and pounds interchangeably in their financial wheelings and dealings. Maybe that's the reality of international currency exchange and the power of the United States. If so, ""Go USA!""Back to the book - It's better than reading nothing, but you might want to read an old National Geographic instead."
1,Worst Of British,"For once, here is a book with an accurate title. Reading it is like sticking your head in the said nest. Stratch that. Sticking your head in a nest of vipers would probably be more fun. I must admit, if this was a movie, it would be like once of those Ed Wood features: so bad it's hillarious. Well, not quite. Badly plotted mystery, with the world's worst every heroine, with the only high point being the suprise addition of a lesbian hitwoman late (far too late) in piece. I got this novel in a bargin bin. I should have left it in the rubish bin."
2,True example of how artist sell-out thier soul!,"Maxi could have left a huge foot print on the walk of Reagge music if he could only remember his roots instead of what is hot on the market. Maxi remember what put you on the map remmber Bonifide, Intantions and the CD Maxi. In the eyes of your true funs like my self you're selling out."
1,Makes a nice paper-weight,Worked great... for a week. Then it did not work at all. I have since stayed clear of everything that this company makes.
1,Beware - Do NOT buy this product!,"This product has a major flaw - it is IMPOSSIBLE to get thesafety latch fastened or unlocked to set up / unfold this bench!You will be cursing each time you do and it gets even worse withimpatient, crying children running around you.I returned the first one and the replacement item was identical.Why hasn't Little Tykes recalled this product? Trust me, do NOTwaste your time, money and frustration on this very poorly engineered(read: crappy) product!!! It would be a great product if it worked, but itsimply doesn't.The most laughable aspect of this product is it's misleadingname: Little Tykes ""Easystore"" table..."
2,"Will bend, warp quickly","I bought this table for inside use. I liked the idea of bench seating for my toddlers. It is a safe table with big some issues. As soon as your child sits on the table (& believe me he won't be able to resist :) the table will sway/bend in the middle & stay that way. It makes it worthless for building blocks, arts, etc....it becomes a tea party table only & even then frustrates kids because nothing will stand up on it. You won't want to give them real food on it because everything will topple & fall off.I just ordered 2 desk size Virco tables with adjustable legs because I know they will never bend. I really don't recommend this table unless you find it at a garage sale for $5 & only want a outdoor play table that swoops down in the middle. Mine is for sale by the way :)"
3,space for cups limits my childs room on the table,"This is a good table, durable. the cup holders are cool, I guess, but when we want to do other things like color, she has very little room in front of her, because of the large dip for cups right in the center of the table"
5,Great Option,"Folds up tiny, like promised, and very slim. Wide, open table top with plenty of room for multiple kiddos to sit at. The curved benches seem to make it easier for little ones to slide in and out of."
4,"Nice size, a little flimsy","This table is cute and a great size, perfect to hold my 2 girls and a few friends. The seat part is narrower and not as sturdy feeling as I expected. I would like to be able to sit opposite my kids for crafts, ect but although there's plenty of room to sit sideways I'm worried it will bend. I found the latches to fold and unfold it a little difficult, hope it doesn't break with the force needed to do it. But I was happy about the price for this product compared to other places and the free shipping and my kids love it and will get lots of use out of it."
5,Great,"My Grandson loves his new larger table, he had the smaller table since he was one but now that he is four, he needed a larger table and this one is great."
5,Little Tikes Products Are Always Reliable,"My daughter had a Little Tikes picnic table and used it from age 2-6 and its durability was terrific. So, when it came time to choose a gift for our 19 month old grandaughter a Little Tikes picnic table was a happy choice. This one is even better than ours was because it can fold up for storage."
1,EasyStore Table,The table arrived at home broken. We returned it and did not buy a new one. I was very dissappointed! There was no fee to return the table and Amazon refunded our money promptly.
4,Great table for the price.. very sturdy.. great for busy toddlers,I have to admit.. I use this table along with my toddler and it feels very sturdy.My 20 month old loves to push furniture around so I wanted to buy something that was a little harder to maneuver. I also didn't want to have to go on a hunt for a chair when I needed her to sit somewhere ( I love that the bench is attached).
5,My kids love it,Hey my kids love this product the color play on it all the time this is lasts for ever I have this for over 2 years and is still in great conditionThe height of the product is also geat better then the step 2 as the step 2 is much shorter then this onegreat product
2,cd review,"When the cd arrived to my house, the case had a crack across the entire front of it. As far as the songs go, there's a lot of good songs but theres no reason why i shouldve received my cd with a broken case"
5,Nice jack!!,This trailer jack comes w/ everything and installs in about five minutes. Very sturdy and a nice rise to get your trailer up on the ball.
4,"did not fit my 3"" x 5"" trailer frame","Description said it will fit a 3"" x 5"" trailer frame but it looks like it would only fit a 3"" x 4"" frame. Giving 4 stars as it is very well built. Wanted to post this review to let people know about the description error. Will try find one that fits. All Fulton wheel jacks say they fit 3"" x 5"" frames but now I'm wary."
5,Fulton Trailer Jack,I purchased this jack to replace an old one wheel jack and what a difference this makes. The crank is so easy my wife can now raise and lower the boat alone. The jack is very heavy duty and has great construction. Very satisfied with this purchase.
5,Solid case with unlimited possibilties,"My company purchased several of these 1495 cases to use for transporting and displaying samples of our products. We actually contacted Pelican and were put in touch with a distributor of theirs. We had the foam inserts custom-made for the items we wanted to protect. We had tried a larger case several months ago with the pick-n-pluck foam. It worked ok, but if you can afford to pay for the customization (i.e. if you need more than one or two cases), I highly recommend going the custom route. The bottles fit like a glove and we couldn't be happier with the end result."
3,Product description off,"Good case, strong, works well.Product descriptions says pick and pluck foam... mine came with solid foam. Can't return because I'm in Afghanistan. Good job Amazon, got one over on another Soldier."
5,Outstanding!,"As a US Marine who goes out in the field, this case protected my Toshiba Qosmio laptop from the harsh elements of the mojave desert. I was running power from my light armored vehicle's power inverted and storing my laptop in this case. We did a ton of bumpy off road driving that would've destroyed my laptop if it had been in perhaps a backpack."
3,Soundtrack CD,The item was shipped in a timely matter and well packaged. The item was in good condition and played well in my cd player.
3,Bootiy Call Soundtrack,"Owned this CD back in 97' and it got lost somewhere in time. So I repurchased it at a great low price through Amazon. It has a great remake of ""Fire and Desire"" by Johnny Gill. Also like the R. Kelly song ""BABY BABY BABY"", And Joes ""Dont Want To Be A Player"" And SWV'S ""Can We"" Get Freaky Tonite. Great R&B. But, most of all the duet of Lil Kim and Too Short on the nasty rap version ""Call Me."""
3,The 'Fire & Desire' Remake kills the CD !!,"This CD is very average for the most part, and decent tracks by Joe, SWV, Lil' Kim, and R.Kelly give the project my 3 stars. Like someone stated before me, the tracklisting is nutty (you have to figure out what you're listening to!), plus that outrageous remake of 'Fire & Desire' by Johnny Gill & Coko costs the CD 2 stars. That classic love song (originally sung by Rick James & Teena Marie in 1981) is completely butchered on this remake. This is one song you just don't mess with, and no remake could do the original any justice. Coko's limited vocal range is made apparent when she reaches for Teena's famous notes (with no luck!), and Johnny Gill 'oversings' his parts. If you want a good laugh, listen to the remake of 'Fire & Desire', and don't spend more than $5.00 for a used copy of 'Booty Call'!"
3,BOOTI CALL,"THIS CD IS OK, NOTHING SPECTACULAR. I THINK THE STANDOUT CUT IS ""IF YOU STAY"" BY THE BACKSTREET BOYS, BOY CAN THEY SING! I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR THEM NOW. THEIR POP TUNES ARE REAL CORNY BUT THIS SONG SHOWS THAT WITH RESPECTED R&B PRODUCERS THEY CAN FLIP THE SCRIPT. RESPECT."
3,Alright Listening!,"I choose this rating because although this is a pretty good cd, I probably wont be listening to it very much. The songs are out of order on the insert, but they are in the correct order on the cd list. The songs on this soundtrack are different from the actual songs on the movie. I wouldn't really recommed this soundtrack to anyone."
5,yay-ya!,Had this when I was 20 & lovin it. Brings me right back to old school days....obscure R&B songs I still love to this day.
3,Backup knowledge,As the others in this series it is a good 'resumé' off deep knowledge on the issue.A litle to much as You'll feel unconfortable unless some what 'initiated' on the subject.Very good for consolidating dispersed acquired knowledge.
2,Massage Therapy or Cult?,"I originally had a 2 page rant on this book, but to sum it up- this book wasn't for me. It is required reading for the accompanying class, and I am assuming everyone purchasing the book is doing so for the same reasons. I almost canceled the class because I thought it was based solely on the book. It is very ""new age,"" to the point of going overboard. There wasn't any valuable information in it. Just read it to get it over with.A newager may like the book as a fun read (which is why I will still give it 2 stars)."
4,Good book,Is a good book to give you an idea of what to expect in a hot stone workshop. Very informative. I recommended it to a friend and she loves it.
4,Not what you think it is,"I bought this thinking it was the musical score of Captain from Castile, and it isnt. Its music written by Alfred Newman, but he apparently has no connection other than that to this disc. Its Newmans listing of a dozen or so of his scores played by someones philharmonic. Good, but pedestrian at its top."
1,A lot of theory but not much practice content,There are a number of related books by these authors but to me 90% of the content is waffle and not really worth the purchase. The other books are very similar and just repeat the same things. Would not recommend these
5,Donkey Kong Land 3,I have it in color.The game is for Game Boy Color and is in Japanese. It is quite hard for me to play the game since I speak normally I just wanted the game in color. Buy it buy it buy it we need more Donkey Kong Land games.
5,An incredible album,"This is an incredible album with a lot of cool and interesting songs, like ""Not Like You"" and ""In a Different Light."" Vicki and Debbi Peterson rock!... Of Susanna's songs, I have to lean towards the one written by Prince: ""Manic Monday."" I can't help it; it's a song I grew up listening to. A very pretty song... I think Michael really shines here with her playful rendition of ""September Gurls"". Also, her voice has a really dark tone, making ""Following"" one of the most moving songs I've ever heard... ""Let It Go"" is the best song and, disappointingly, also the shortest. Their four-part harmony here is brilliant."
2,TWO SONGS DO NOT A GOOD ALBUM MAKE,"""Walking Down Your Street"" and ""If She Knew What She Wants"" are both high caliber songs. They sound good, the lyrics make sense and they are just all around good songs.The rest of the album did not appeal to me. I didn't like any of the other songs and I especially detested ""Walk Like an Egyptian."" Like real Egyptians walked around with their limbs at right angles following obsessive/compulsive step formations! Oh, puh-lease! That song has never once failed to irk me. I hate it.The Bangles were talented, but I just was not one of their fans or followers."
4,for a while ...,"For a while back in the 1980s, the Bangles - fronted by the inimitable Susanna Hoffs - practically defined the upbeat Girl Band phenomenon. Lightly packaged female angst about men, relationships, and getting to work late again combine with one of the all-time most memorable tunes ('Walk Like an Egyptian') to make DIFFERENT LIGHT an eminently own-able album, one that repays regular listening. The latter song also generated one of the all-time best early music videos.Influences? One thinks of Heart, especially in the broody voice of Vicki Peterson, who looks seriously offended on the album paperwork. There's an almost Dylan-esque ironic randomnness in the lyrics of 'Egyptian', though the similarities end there.In sum, a tight sound and a fun band to watch. 'Generative of a question that may await resolution in eternity: 'What ever happened to the Bangles?'"
4,Three words - NO REVIEW REQUIRED!,If you grew up during the 80s and need to read a review on a Bangles album then my sympathies are with you! :-)Even though its probably not too late to catch with tunes that remind you of the carefree and fun 80s.
1,Don't waste your money!,"Unless you plan to use the 6000 model, the 5000, or 4000 models for true free to air don't waste your money. Support for these models virtually doesn't exist. I have two of them...they will probably make good bookends! Move on to Viewsat, Sonicview, or Captiveworks."
3,not the best of Charlie Hustle,"First of all, i ain't a hater. But i was all hyped about bying this cd. The only reason it got three stars iz cuz of the pac appearance and things'll neva change. Only 50% of the songs were koo. In a major way was twenty times better...now that deserves 5 stars. But i love e-40 cuz he knows how to represent for the yay area. keep spittin' them lyrics and coming up with that unique slang that all the eastcoast people bite off of!"
2,Not the greatest,"I tried this item on both my regular and mini UCO lanterns. To be honest, the focusing of light wasn't that great. When I set both lanterns about 8 or 10 feet from a wall I could see a little extra light being directed with the reflector but I can't say that it would help in seeing better. I think I could have gotten the same results with aluminum foil. Sorry OCO, but this one didn't do it for me."
4,nice touch,"Not a critical piece of kit, but nice to have for a couple of reasons. Bends pretty easy and you end up with a funny light pattern, but all in all, a nice addition."
2,Should of stuck with the Original title WHEELS OF CONFUSION,"As a fan of Black Sabbath, I was disappointed in this book.Rosen had his chance to write a definitive book on Sabbath and failed miserably.His failure however left the door open for two other excellent books to be written.1. HOW BLACK WAS OUR SABBATH by David Tangye and Graham Wright. (Yea!)2. NEVER SAY DIE by Garry Sharpe-YoungTo the reviewer who said about Rosen's book, there are no better books on Black Sabbath out there, I say bollocks!DO NOT buy Rosen's book until you have gotten HOW BLACK WAS OUR SABBATH and NEVER SAY DIE.Then if you are still hungry for more Sabbath books, I would recommend the Mike Stark book BLACK SABBATH AN ORAL HISTORY and lastly Steve Rosen's appropriately priced book."
4,Omar junans' wonderful review of Black Sabbath,"This book about Black Sabbath is extremely interesting. It tells about how the band evolved and became who they are now. It shows the ups and the downs of the musical scene in the seventy's and eighty's. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Ozzy Osbourne. If you like rock and roll and everything that comes with it, you will love this book."
5,A WONDERFUL SCORE,"When will a fully staged, complete, professional revival of this extraordinary musical be presented, hopefully on Broadway? It seems that producers are ""frightened"" of the racial satire inherent in the plot in which a white, republican bigot becomes, in one magical moment, an African American sharecropper. Much less worthy musicals have been revamped, redesigned, even re-written and have become hits.The Burton Lane/E. Y. Harburg score is certainly one of the glories of the golden age of musical comedy featuring some of the most beautiful songs to ever grace a stage: ""Ole Devil Moon"" and ""If This Isn't Love"" and, especially, the perennially recorded ""How Are Things In Glocca Morra?"". Even the comic songs score points: ""When I'm Not Near The Girl I Love..."" and ""The Begat.""This original cast recording has sound that is not the best, but the performers shine and until a new, complete recording is made, this one will have to do. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
4,A good compilation against Scientism,This book is valuable in that it is a good overall review of various arguments against materialism and scientism that seems so well established and anchored in our modern world view. This book will help start ripping out those deep dry roots. A new dimension and view of reality will start opening up and you will see that your concept of reality has been so limited by modern science and that existence is much more profound and mysterious than the materialist philosophy conveyed to you in school and popular culture. You can skip around and read on various subjects. Some of the chapters are excellent and its a good introduction to the various authors that champion the traditionalist philosophy and metaphysics.
1,Cisco 7970G IP Phone for SIP Environments? No.,"Nice looking phone, but what a pain to configure in an Asterisk environment. I've configured Polycom and Cisco 7960 Phones so I have some experience with tftp and editing all the config files. These Cisco 7970 phones come preloaded with SCCP and not SIP firmware. That is the first hassle, which requires purchasing a Cisco SmartNet service contract ($10.99) from CDW. You then have to wait at least 5 business days for Cisco to approve the service contract before you can even get the firmware. I will never purchase this phone ever again -- it isn't worth it. Too many other good options out there to have to go through this nightmare."
1,Ítem was not new as offered,The item was previously used but offered as if it were new. To set it up has been a big problem as it is password blocked so new firmware must be downloaded but the version managed by the phone is old so the one available it Cisco right now is not useful. I have not been able set the phone to use it as it should have brought at least the passwords stablished by the previous user/administrator
5,Worth the money,Chair arrived almost assembled. All I had to do is place the seat on the base and I was done! Never had one that easy. Very sturdy and good back support. Have had it for 2 months and no complaints yet.
2,rip off,"First of all my charger was stole I went to target to get something, so that I could charge my phone I did not have it for even a week, when the charger shorted out, I had to twist and turn, hang the phone upside down, I have a co-worker, who uses the same charger, she also went to Target to get a new charger same thing happened the charger shorted out and we had to play with to get it to work,to different people, to charger brought in store states a part, I took my the charger back to Target! We spent $16.00 for it, some would say you get what you pay for, but this was just careless, on the. Company level."
2,Won't work in every pond...,"I found that the net was thinner than expected and would easily catch on the cement blocks surrounding my pond. It also did not hold much weight (a clump of algae for example) without placing too much weight on a portion of the net, causing it to sink. A sinking net is not good for small fish and acts as a gill net catching the fish. The instructions suggest anchoring the perimeter every 5 to 10 feet, but on a small pond, surrounded by cement blocks, no real easy way to do this. It was worth a try but knowing what I know now, I would not have purchased it for my pond."
5,Real Hip Hop,"I was really suprised when I heard this CD. This CD shows what the Real Hip Hop is about. It's a shame radio stations do not play KRS-ONE music alot since there are some great tracks such as The MC, Step into a world, a friend, and can't stop wont't stop. You can obviously tell this album took sometime to put together and wasn't just thrown together to make a album. People like Nelly and Fabolous sell records basically off of catchy beats but have nothing to offer lyrically. I don't fault people for buying those sub-par albums but they are just uneducated about what Real Hip Hop is all about. I hope KRS-ONE next album is as good as this one."
2,My least fav from krs,"P. diddy should've never be in a krs record i kinda felt like krs was tryin to sell out wit diz album... Good tracks ""the mc"" & "" a friend"" krs even did a rock track... Skip diz and get all his other albums."
5,"KRS-ONE, always has been and always will be onea tha best",I got next is a tru example of Krs' talent.. hes a raw as he ever was and doesnt show any signs of letting up... id deff reccomend this.
4,Better than advertised,"This movie tends to get poor reviews. While it isn't necessarily Harrison Ford's best or most famous effort, there are a number of things to like about the movie. The concept of two people getting together after the death of one or both of their spouses in an accident isn't necessarily fresh and the idea of corruption in high places isn't either, but this movie has just enough romance and just enough action to keep your attention. It's not terribly memorable or original, but it's good enough to be entertaining."
3,"Not so exciting,yet interesting progband from Turin(Italy)","There are some interesting symphonic breaks through, with an interesting flow of melodies and a pretty instrumental interplay between the keyboards and the guitar (Arcansiel-like or in the vein of bands such as Nuova Era, Galadriel and so on)...this work is better than the insipid 1st album,by means of conceptual pieces, sometimes influenced by early Marillion. The vocals have improved a lot, in comparison to their debut, even if They are inferior than other italian prog bands such as Aufklarung or Sacka, from the point of view of their creativity and composition as well ...quite recommended if you like the bands I have mentioned above"
3,Useful but not great,The previous reviews are right in that the garlic needs to be pushed down and they bounce around as you turn the handle. I sort of solved that problem by turning the handle slower. If I had the chance to try it I might not have bought it but it was cheap and works well enough for me. I didn't see the other products before I bought this one.
4,Works well for garlic---and for romano peccorino,"Unlike the other reviewers, I really liked this little device. I had no trouble getting to create thin slices of garlic, quickly and easily. I found that if I just turned the slicing drum rapidly, the garlic fed in fine.Even better, I can cut a slap of romano peccorino or Parmesan cheese and use the device to create very nice shavings of the cheese. Might even work with chocolate, though I've not yet tried that.I'm happy with it."
1,POORLY ENGINEERED,"I AM IN THE EQUIPMENT BUSINESS AND WHEN WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT WORKS LIKE THIS, I CHANGE IT. THIS SLICER NEEDS A HANDHELD PUSHER TO FORCE THE GARLIC INTO THE BLADE AREA, NOT UNLIKE A MEAT SLICER AT YOUR SUPERMARKET.AFTER READING THESE REVIEWS, WE HAVE A SAYING AT OUR COMPANY, ALL THOSE GOOD PEOPE CAN'T BE WRONG. STICK WITH A SHARP KNIFE BEFORE SPENDING MONEY ON THIS. MY BAD!!!!"
1,Missing a key part..,"The gizmo needs a spring loaded lid that holds or pushes the garlic into the breech. Without it the garlic keeps popping out as the crank is turned. This brand looks like others that function far better because of the described modification that is absent here. The slicer itself is quite good but you have to push the garlic into it with your fingers and doing so might result in.... Well, you get the point (or the slice, if you aren't paying attention)."
1,Agree with above reviews,"I formed the same opinion as the other reviewers for the same reasons. This product not only doesn't work, it's dangerous."
4,favorite Martin And Lewis,Good quality no problem viewing. My kids like to watch this movie over and over again. If you like slap stick this is a must for your collection.
4,Check out the cover art!,"Being a huge fan of Martin & Lewis I was pleased to see that this movie had been released to DVD. Not sure why it wasn't included in the Martin & Lewis sets that featured all of their movies but three. The movie itself is a classic but I was disappointed in the cover art. The first mistake I noticed was on the back cover. Instead of a scene from this movie a scene from ""The Caddy"" was used. Also, on the front cover, I noticed the dollar bills used were not even in existance when this movie was made. Very poor graphic design if you ask me."
2,ONLY if you're a fan of Runyonesque characters,"I am NOT a fan of Damon Runyon or ""Guys and Dolls"", but I DO like Martin and Lewis, so I got this DVD. But I could hardly watch it. The best moment, in my opinion, is Jerry helping a mother dog cross a busy street. The rest of it I fast-forwarded through very quickly... oh well. I may trade this one back in to Amazon for store credit.I also noticed, as another reviewer here did too, that the DVD's cover art is peculiar. As far as the disc, the actual digital film transfer is well done, and the color looks very good for being more than a half-century old.- William"
3,Definitely cuts the smell,"I have three dogs, one very large, and that means a lot of waste. Doggie Dooley enzymes do a great job of breaking it down and eliminating the associated oder. I just add three scoops (one per dog) every week or so and pour a little water over it. I clean the yard daily, and you can really see that this product is working day by day. It's easy and it completely eliminates the smell. You can't ask for more than that."
4,Empowering in a Melencholy Weigh,"Little Billy in his wheelchair cannot turn off any of the frequencies but manages to tune in on what's most important - in this case a communique concerning a button. What button? The big red one.Only occasionally descending into Waters' trademark abyss, this is lighter fare than 'the wall' and Billy can even be empowering to the listener at times.Especially dig 'the powers that be,' 'the tide is turning,' and the title cut."
1,Simply Useless,"I still can't believe it..... I was such a fan of Chantay savage, yearning for this new album for years. ""this time"" is one of the worst album i possess. there ain't no song that saves the cd; each one looks like the other; the production is so poor and common....a total DISASTER. I love chantay's two first albums, ""here we go again"" and ""i will survive."" Steve ""silk"" hurley's production was simply great, as usual. Chantay's voice is as beautiful as before...but that's all. Don't waste your time...this album is awful."
1,Plagiarized at least in part,"Joanne Parrent plagiarized an article I wrote in 2000 called ""Film Festival Strategy: Guerilla Marketing"" and published it in this book under her own name. I contacted Mike Saunders, the editor of the book, and he admitted that she had used my work without permission. I sued them but lost, they had much better attorneys than I did. Anyway, you can enjoy my writing in this book if you decide to purchase it. I agree with the other reviewer that said the book was a ""wanna be's dream and a professional's nightmare"". Except the part I wrote, can't remember which pages they were but just look for the word for word copy of my article. You can Google my version and compare and contrast."
5,"Beautiful, Simple Vase","Elegant, but does not distract from the flowers it holds. Looks good in multiple decor settings. It is easy to clean."
4,excellent,I found this book to be a great read. I picked it up because it was written by one of my favorite authors (and I got lucky with it being a vampire novel). I like the different slant he took on vampires.
3,new twists on old themes,"gr-s puts a great twist on the vampire mythos. he puts foward a very interesting hypothesis for the origin and transmission of vampirism. a very good read, quick and tight."
4,Coleman one pound refil adaptor,The refil adaptor works as described and I used the well publisized method of freezing the bottle prior to filling.I found it best to weigh the bottle as it filled to avoid over filling.Richard
1,THIS IS MY TOWN,"The film opens with some horrible first person narration to build a story. Queen Pin (Rhanni) becomes the mistress of a drug dealer. When he gets busted, she goes to jail too for being a bad actress, a crime in Jacksonville. Once out she wants to build her ""own organization"" so she can start her own record label, although I couldn't figure out why she needed her own record label. She mostly spends her disposable income on clinging clothes that make her look chunky.As a new drug dealer in town, she steps on the toes of the existing one. The writing was cliche and the dialouge was terrible. The actors couldn't deliver their lines with any kind of realism. One of the guys had the nickname ""Killer."" The only thing Gin X accomplished was to make 50 Cent look like a genius, and I didn't think that was possible.F-bombs, n-words, sex, no nudity."
5,Breath taking!,"This is the first time I have been inspired to post a review. Deborah's photographs are some the most beautiful blank and white photos I have ever seen. My first thought when I started looking at her book was that I would love to have her take portraits of my dogs. Her work is inspiring and will break your heart. And, as a dog lover, I loved her subjects and the delightful way she choose to portray them. This -- and her book ""Dog"" -- is an absolute must for any artist, photographer or dog lover."
1,"Warranty out, doesn't work","I have had this dvd combo and it worked great until it was about 1 year old. The warranty ran out, and it started spitting dvd's out saying it couldn't recognize them. Called customer service and was told I hadto pay $60 for them to look at it, but they couldn't guarantee anything. For that price, I might as well buy a new one!I'm lucky if a dvd plays. I opened a brand new dvd, put it in and it wouldn't read. One time it did read one, then then next time I tried to play it, it spit it out. All I can do now is watch the vhs. It's 2 years old now. Was it worth 100.00 a year, no. (about the price when bought)"
4,Excellent book on football training,"When a football player follows this book they will increase there skills and abilities exponentially. The training program in this book helped me to increase my forty yard dash time by .2 seconds over a summer, and also helped me to score in the top 5 on my team in overall atheletic ability!"
5,hip surgery or not,"This book is very informative and can help a prospective hip surgery patient decide about his or her options. It is very helpful. I had hip surgery over 15 years ago; and I am hopeful about the new treatments today. I can say from personal experience, the exercises are critical to walking with ease whether you have surgery or not."
4,Very helpful,"I found this book to be informative. Much of it is about stretching and strengthening exercise programs in the pool and on land. I would have liked to had have more in-depth information on soft tissue issues (such as tendonitis, capsulitis, psoas). The best thing about this book is that it exists at all, as I am finding it very difficult to locate books on restoring hip health."
4,I think it's working!,"My husband has been in therapy after a badly broken hip and pelvic region for several months, but had never heard about water therapy until we read this book. He found a hospital that offers it and is now giving it a try. It seems to be helping."
4,Very Helpful Information,My husband and I are both starting to experience pain in the morning with our hips. A friend recommended this book and it has been very helpful for the exercises it offered. We have been doing them and feeling much better. Better than surgery!!
1,Save your money!,"All this information is on the internet or available from your doctor. After many years of struggling with hip pain the water exercises are no surprise. Nothing in the book is new. I was very disappointed, if I could do the exercises listed, I wouldn't need the book. Good luck to all of you, go to the local Y or swim therapy, put the money to good use for a good therapist, hips are not do it yourself."
2,What Fundamental Relations?,"Somewhat disappointing as I was looking for a deeper explanation of the fundamental relations, as the book's name implies. Aikido and Tai Chi Chuan are both internal martial arts and I would have thought that the philosophies, techniques & applications would have been described in more detail than maybe the two sentences mentioned in the entire book. A great deal is discussed about the history of the Chinese Martial Arts and its influences into the Japanese martial arts, which is fine and perhaps from which the fundamental relations are drawn from. In this case, the book should have been titled - ...""The Historical Relations."" Keep looking elsewhere if you are searching the true fundamental relations."
5,13 years later and I still love it.,"I still play this game almost every day on my game boy color. This is, in my opinion, the best Tetris game ever made. I got this for my 7th birthday and have logged thousands of hours on it. I have other systems and games but this is by far my favorite game of all time."
5,"Fast, furious and fun!","You will love Tetris DX! I had the Tetris Gold Collection from Spectrum Holobyte CD for Windows, and I didn't think I would like this one, but it hooked me! You can change the music, pause the game and it keeps 3 of your highest scores. Very addictive and enjoyable!"
4,poignant and subtle political satire,"Milos Forman's 'fireman's ball' is a classic among political satires.. It is remarkable that a film so subtle would be condemned by the czech government. It, in fact, appears harmless to our sensibilities today.. this indicates just how repressive the czech government was at the time.. Not to indicate any superiority in the U.s. (think of all the books and movies that have sadly been censored and banned from schools and the like here)... The fact is this film is a great satire of a desperate nation - forman comments on the common phrase of the time - if you do not steal you are stealing from your family.The technical aspects of the film are also spot on.. It is perfectly formed and sculpted at 73 min.. as elegant as a Borges short story.. highly recommended viewing."
4,Forman's last Czech film and first color film.,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.The Fireman's Ball, known as ""Horí, má panenko"" in the Czech language, is a major film of the Czech new wave movement.The story is about a party a the firehouse that preoccupies the firemen so much that they barely notice the alarm for a nearby fire. The film is intended as a comedy and has some great slapstick humor in it.The film infuriated the censors in communist Czechoslovakia and was banned ""forever"" This prompted Forman to move to the US and has since went on to direct ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" ""Amadeus"" and some others.The DVD has an interview with Forman and a special look at the film's transfer by Criterion and remarks by Forman and cinematographer, Miroslav Ondricek.This film is sure to please."
4,Great for a quickie!,"This book is structured very differently. Its 30+ stories are divided under 5 sub-headings, each characterizing different tastes and temptations. These include stories of times gone by, futuristic stories, and phase of life (and womanhood) stories, including tales of open lesbian love affairs, forbidden passions, life-long lovers, and stories about identity confusions--basically, very similar to real life. Any one section is bound to hold a gem of a tale. I just picked this book up, so I haven't read that many stories, but the one I like so far is ""Free Love"" by Ali Smith, which is about a young girl's first love-making experience, and the first time she falls in love with another woman. Very touching. If you're in the mood to read a short and tender, romantic lesbian love story, minus nasty sex scenes that often demean the female body, then this book is for you. It's great...very enjoyable!"
5,"For ""emerging"" parents",This book has already been very described and valued. I bought this to send to my daughter. I am reading and she will have to wait a while. Wonderfully enjoyable.
4,progress in designing and running a grid,"The book defines the state of the art of grid networks. It shows the progress made in recent years. No longer is a grid network mostly a conceptual idea or just an implementation that proves such a network is possible.Instead, much of the book is devoted to showing how to design and manage in some optimal manner a grid network. Definite progress. Another plus is a section that discusses how to integrate such a network with the distributed Web Services. Something that plays naturally to the distributed nature of the grid. There are simple examples using Web Services Description Language and UDDI. Nothing too sophisticated yet, unfortunately. But maybe in later editions of this book, we'll see some nontrival Web Services explained."
2,Marginal Advertising Book,"I purchased this book expecting more detail and theory about the practice of advertising. Instead this book was very high level, almost high school-ish. I found very little useful information about advertising practices and rules.Secondly, since this book is a UK book it is very British centric. Since I did not find out this was a UK book looking on Amazon this was also a disappointment."
1,The Worst,Shaq and his family must have written the 5 star reviews for this cd because I would't wish this horrid piece of crap on my worst enemy
1,More Worthless Than an Old Car Battery,"You've got to be kidding me. For starters how can one have the guile to make a ""greatest hits"" albulm when you've only actually made two albulms? Further, how can you make one when the stuff you have is already so horrid? Possibly the only use for this CD is to give it to your worst enemy and hope they suffer the terrible fate of having to listen to this albulm."
1,BAD Joke,Shaq Has No Rap Skills.He Is Very Bland on The Mic.His Lyrics are COrny.His Free-Throws are Better than His Flow.
1,SUX<SUX<SUX<SUX<SUX<SUX,"Shaq sux, lets be honest. Anyone who would call this music instead of a shameless marketing scam must have traded there brain cells with the big oaf himself"
1,Buy it for pure humor,"If you're ever feeling sad, just pop this CD in and listen to ""Biological Didn't Bother"" in either of the two versions here. It's so unintentionally hilarious, which is kind of sad because Shaq is really sincere and seems like a really nice guy to boot. But you will find yourself laughing out loud at couplets like ""I learned to dribble from right to left/I couldn't do a damn thing with all them F's"" or when he names family members whose house he stayed at when ""moms gotta go to work.""If you can track down a video clip of this song, it just intensifies the comedy. If this album were a satire of rap music (of which 98% in my opinion is just as bad as this record) then it would be an easy 5 stars. Happy listening!(PS the other tracks are pretty comical too... ""Yo Shaq, where ya at? Yo yo, I'm over here"")"
1,This CD is trash,"Shaq is a disgrace to the name hip-hop, and if these are his greatest hits then he should give up. Go buy some Mos Def or Pharoahe Monch you retards. Dont buy this. Its wack..."
1,I was taken hostage by Albanians,Before I was released I was given a choice. Listen to Shaq's greatest hits the whole way through or eat a bucket of dirty toenail clippings. I opted for the CD and half way through I wish I had chosen the bucket.So this is the 'best' of Shaq's albums huh? I would hate to listen to his B-sides.I can barely watch him struggle through a Burger King commercial never mind listening to him sing. I can't even understand him when he talks.
5,These shoes are great.,Love these shoes. They were a gift for my sister. I recommend them. They are well made and very stylish looking. They have a smart look about them.
4,"comfort and style - yes, it is true!","I am not a flashy person, but I do like a great ""pop"" in a shoe. Nine West always makes a comfy shoe with style and this is no exception. The fushia works well with the gold accents. Every time I wear these shoes, they stir up comments - the good kind! Great with jeans or a skirt, these are a great accent piece to any wardrobe."
4,My first experience with the Blue Hawaiians,"I bought the album based on a favorable review of a live show. I didn't know what to expect, and it took just two listens to this album to knock my socks off!! The tunes transport the listener to some exotic 1950s-based tropical isle, a refreshing change from current-day hits which have no melody or the maddening '70s and '80s ""retro"" trends. I've got to get their other albums, and look forward to seeing them on tour."
1,Over produced.,"Seeing them live from Vegas to Redondo Beach to the Lava Lounge, I don't see how anyone could rate this 5 stars. It is over produced and way to commerical. And what is up with the song ""CHEAT?"" They ruined it!. If anyone ever heard the first two CD's before listening to this so called CD, you'd know what I was talking about. They should stay true to their original music, because this new stuff stinks!"
5,"BIG! Beautiful, and stylish.","Yes, it's big, but I didn't think it was heavy. ***I JUST WEIGHED THIS KETTLE WHILE IT WAS FULL OF WATER AND IT ONLY WEIGHS 6 POUNDS. I can see that if you have trouble lifting a cat or bag of flour then you may have a problem here.The craftsmanship is pure Kitchenaid. You will have no problem there. But beware that ONLY the stainless steel version is usable on glass-top stoves. The ceramic-covered versions are NOT. ***For those that don't know, you can click on this product to see what a glass-top stove/range looks like: Ceramabryte 28oz Cooktop CleanerThe whistle is a bit screechy, but then again, you want it to alert you over the noise of the house.The handle DOES get hot. Not burn-your-hand hot, but very warm. If you only touch the rubber part, you're fine, but you almost have to grab the whole thing to lift it and pour it safely.I highly recommend getting the stainless steel version; it's beautiful and functional."
1,Rusted,I have had many tea pots and most of them have been inexpensive.I purchased this one hoping it would last longer and notrust. I've had it for less than a month and itis rusting already. I've been drying it out afterever use to try to lengthen it's life.I thought that if I spent $50 on a teapot it would last...wrong!!
3,9 months of reliable use and then...,the pour spout mechanism stopped working. I've hammered the brackets into place and am hoping it holds for a while more but I have a feeling it's only a matter of time before I'm unable to open and close the spout with ease.I completely agree with those to also loved the design of this stainless still water warming beauty but I'm afraid our time may be nearly up.Hope others have better luck than I've had.
1,I do not like this tea kettle,"Handle gets really hot, spout won't stay open, the opening on top is too small. There's gotta be a world of better tea kettle options available in the 50 dollar range."
3,It's ok,"Fundamentally, it's a stainless steel kettle. It doesn't have a magnetic bottom, so I wouldn't buy it for induction.I have 2 problems with it, hence the 3 stars. First, the handle heats up, and is too hot to hold, using it on a gas range. It might be fine on electric, no idea. Second, the whistle does after a couple of years. Kitchen aids quality has quite noticeably gone downhill over the years, this is just another example. Sadly, it's gone from a brand I trusted to a brand that makes me automaticallyLy think twice - they are heading towards sunbeam territory, and it's time for somebody to start making their products with the old quality"
4,Good but not Great,It is a good kettle. It looks nice.It should for what it cost me. My major upset is that the handle gets hot! Everytime I use it ( which is at least once a day) I have to wrap a towel around the handle in order to pour the water. Would I buy another KitchenAid Kettle? Not until they change the design.
2,Not the best,"I prefer a kettle with a wide enough opening to put my hand inside for cleaning. The rubber on the handles seems cheap. Also the handle requires a oven mitt to hold when hot. very pretty though!!! If you don't use it a lot, and mostly want something that looks nice, this is for you."
3,Almost There,This is a very good tea pot but was let down because of the function of how you have to open the spout. Othere than that it looks great.
1,plastic part will melt with heat,"Watch out! Some parts are made of plastic, so they will melt with heat. And, once it melts, the kettle looks so ugly. It happened with in a day of parchace. If possible, I wish I did not buy the product."
4,Kitchen Aid Tea Kettle,"I looked at everything on Amazone and this one caught my eye. Reviews always cause me to pause, because many are so negative. I finally decided that you just can't please everyone, so I bought it. It is just fine. I use it every day at least once. I would buy it again in a second. I really don't understand why some others were so unhapy with the ""whistle"" and the finish. It is a brushed stainless steel pot and lovely."
3,"Products heats water very fast but you need to use a pot holder when picking up the kettle, it gets very hot.",The pot heats water very fast but you need to use a pot holder to pick it up. The handle gets very hot.
2,Good design - Does not last,"I bought one of these 4 years ago. It's a nice enough kettle - I had no trouble with the handles getting too hot or anything, and I like the 1-piece construction of the body (I've had kettles come apart t the seams before) but it started to deteriorate after 2 years. Call me old-fashioned, but a teakettle should last 20+ years if not abused.The spout and whistle-cap mechanism are not as well-constructed as the body of the kettle. The spout began to get loose and the cap started wobbling after about 2 years of use - it became tricky to get the cap to sit right (and if not, no whistle)About a month ago, the mechanism stopped being able to hold the cap open - now it won't stop whistling unless I prop the spout open with something.I'm buying something else this time**FYI - after reading the reviews here I also wonder about the metal content of this item - particularly the spout (one reviewer says it's aluminum, but I think mine is rusting)"
3,"Decent kettle, but useless on induction stoves","I ordered this kettle since it is nice looking and stainless steel. It IS nice in person, but its iron content must be very low (maybe ""too high quality"" stainless?) because it took FOREVER to boil water on our induction (electromagnetic) stove. So long that, even though my wife really liked the look of it, I returned it. It took 5+ times longer to boil water in it than a regular pot, rendering it useless. If we had an electric or gas stove, we would have kept it; hence the 3 stars.I'm trying the Demeyere Resto 2.6-qt kettle next since at least one reviewer said it works well on induction stoves. I really wanted the Spring 1040 for the same reason (and since we prefer the look of it), but it hasn't been available for months. :("
3,"Decent teapot, but expected better from the brand","In all fairness, I bought this teapot to replace a teapot I loved (Le Creuset porcelain teapot), after I found out it was no longer being made. So, it really wasn't what I was looking for in the first place. The pros are that it is quite large and the water boils pretty quickly. Also, I was surprised to find the handle actually stayed cool (the one issue I had with my Le Creuset.) It doesn't whistle, which I noticed was a negative in some other reviews, however, I wasn't used to one that did, so I don't really mind. The one issue I have is that the spout has been leaking since day one. The water pours out in three different streams and would get all over my counter, if it wasn't for the huge bowl-style mugs I usually use for tea. Had I used a coffee mug, it would have been a mess. I really expect better quality from KitchenAid. While I won't return it, I wouldn't recommend it either."
3,"Beautifull kettle, but dribbles and spits hot water out of the spout","Well, I read the reviews that said this tea kettle spit hot water out of the spout, but I hoped that it was only due to over filling the kettle. I was careful and filled the kettle a half inch below the maximum marked on the kettle, but no matter how much or little water was in the kettle, it spit and dribbled hot water, and for the price I expect more, I am returning it. I'm really sad to though, because it's such a nice looking kettle."
3,Beautiful kettle,This is a beautiful looking kettle that I like very much. I enjoy hearing the kettle whistle when the water is ready. It does not get perfect marks because the handle gets very hot. I cover my hand with an oven mitt or towel when using it.
4,"Nice, solid kettle","This kettle replaced a 10-year-old Revereware kettle, which was still working fine but didn't match my new set of Kitchenaid pots and pans. It's beautiful and solid, a nice heavy weight but not too heavy. It's easy to clean because I can fit my whole hand inside the opening and scrub, and I have large hands. The lid stays on nice and tight and the whistle is loud enough to alert me from anywhere in the house. I didn't notice the handle getting hot like some mentioned, but I didn't fill past the maximum fill line. It's so pretty that it stays out on the stove all the time and the brushed stainless resists fingerprints. Should last me a long time."
3,Handle heats up...,"...that's what I would've liked to know before I purchased this thing. There's silicone (or something) on the handle itself as well as at the points where the handle joins the body, but those may just be for show, as you clearly need to use a potholder to pick this thing up. It's pretty (the brushed version anyway), it's nicely weighted and pours alright, and has a wide enough base to accommodate my largest burner on my stove and heats up fast.Other reasons I don't love this thing:The whistle tone is shrillThe hole on top is kind of small, too small to really get in there and clean it out.You have to manually flip that lever to open AND to close the spoutSlim pickins here on Amazon tho, and I'm not sure if anybody has a kettle that has a cool handle... so I think it's ok.UPDATE: One of the hard-plastic pads that sit betweet the handle and the kettle's body has partially melted. I'm not sure how or why, and the kettle still works just fine."
2,Not such a great buy,"I've had this tea kettle for about a month and I thought so far so good until one day when I was washing I noticed a bit of rust inside. Then I started noticing rust around the top of the whistler. It's a functional pot in that it serves its purpose to boil water and whistle; however, paying over $40 for something that is supposed to be stainless and rusts within a month leads me to rate this product low; needless to say, this is being retunred to Amazon."
4,Best Tea Kettle I've found so far...,I really like this tea kettle. It's easy to use with the spout that opens nicely and the padding on the handle. It seems like it takes a while to boil though. Other than that it's a great tea kettle.
1,Amazon sold me an old kettle,"I just got my stainless kettle, and the hinge is scratched and used! I am applaud by such. I asked for a new kettle, NOT a used kettle. Anyhow, I will have to go to Kohl's or etc. to buy from now on. I am buying a new kettle at Kohl's and exchanging for a new kettle there instead. This also happened last time I purchased a Vulli for my daughter, and it was USED as well. Amazon's quality and goods have gone WAY down. I rather pay more for new items, NOT USED."
1,Problems - Taking it back!,"If you like filtered water, beware. I cannot fill this with filtered water from my fridge because the handle is fixed into place, it doesn't swivel to allow me to get close enough to get the water into pot. The spout won't reach the dispenser either. This is a major problem for me because I like filtered water. It also leaks steam from the lid and dribbles water all over the stove top. I am taking this back, what a disappointment."
1,Garbage,"If you're an average size male, getting your hand in and out of this kettle to clean it is almost impossible. It's definitely not made with American males in mind, perhaps in the land of Lilliputians it would be ok!"
2,Tea Kettle,"I cannot comment on the kettle's performance. I must have had trouble understanding the ordering buttons, as I had thought I was ordering a (specifically) RED kettle. Not only did my red kettle turn out to be brushed stainless (silver), but I received it too late for Christmas. Not only was it late, it arrived without instructions for returning the item. I have sent (three) Emails to Macy's, asking for return/exchange information. I have now received (seven) Email responses from Macy's apologizing for the delay in responding, but that I should get an answer within three to five days...They should have said three to five weeks! I am not happy!"
1,No whistlin' here,"Such a beautiful tea kettle, but the first issue was the sticky tape they used to tape on the lid. It left a thick residue on both sides of the lid and pot. I put peanut butter on the residue and let it sit for a couple days and was finally able to wipe off the residue and try my tea kettle.Unfortunately, I was disappointed because my tea kettle did not whistle. The seal isn't tight enough, so steam dribbled out the spout onto my ceramic top. I'm sorry that I will have to return it; I need the whistle since I don't stand over the stove waiting for the water to boil."
2,Rusted after one week.,"We purchased this kettle to replace our old enamel-coated Kitchen Aid kettle that had started to rust inside. We assumed that since it was stainless it would not rust. This kettle started rusting inside after only one week of use. Obviously NOT stainless steel. Plus, I could tell that the kettle purchased years ago was superior in craftmanship compared to the current model. Our Kitchen Aid stand mixer is all that it should be, but I will stay away from Kitchen Aid accessories and lower end products from now on."
2,why make a kettle with a sloppy spout?,"love the look and feel but watch your feet when you pour the boiling water out of it. It has some sort of splash delivery system that half does-half does not make it into the cup. It ends up running onto the counter then my bare feet on floor. Seriously, how do you make a tea kettle that can't pour? I keep tryng different ways to pour the water out, ie angle,speed but it always ends the same - a puddle on the counter.michelle milne"
5,LOVE this LOUD Tea Kettle!!!,"This tea kettle is THE BEST! I've unfortunately been one to forget putting on a previous (same brand - Kitchen Aid Gourmet, but the 2.25 Quart, Soft Grip) tea kettle that did NOT whistle! Because it didn't whistle, & I'd forget, I left the kettle on TOO long, burnt the bottom, melting the outer layer onto our burner! After reading reviews about this one, I decided to give it a try, & it IS awesome. :)"
3,Too hot to handle,"This is a nice looking kettle that has good balance, a nice loud whistle, and holds a good amount of water. My only complaint is that it is impossible to pour from without using a pot holder. I am a chef and I am known to have asbestos fingers and hands but I cannot hold this to pour without protection. It is a shame because there are nice soft grips on the handles. Unfortunately they do not extend out far enought to protect the hands."
5,Great for Inductive Stove Top,Love the fact that the flat bottom makes this kettle perfect for my inductive stove top. Heats fast and whistles loudly.
2,Looks nice but not practical,"The kettle looks nice and works as you would expect. However, the handle gets hot, and the location of the spout cover makes it difficult to release without burning your fingers. I would not buy this again."
5,Great Teapot,"Before purchasing this teapot I read many reviews some of which were negative. I took a leap and purchased. It is a great teapot!Most of the negative comments had to be from people who did not read the instructions. Teapot pours well, heats on medium without melting the ""rubber"" coatings and looks great on the stove. Stainless model works very well on my glass cook top."
3,"Great kettle, but the handle on mine does get very hot","My husband & I like how easy this kettle is to fill and clean but once the water came to a boil the handle was blistering hot and burnt my hand. There are nice looking rubber grips on the handle, but it does not cover all of the metal and it does not protect your hand from the hot steel. Some people had no trouble with this at all and I'm glad for them, but nevertheless, some customers had the same complaint as I do and one customer's grips were melted off from the excessive heat. If you buy this kettle, just be sure to take it off the heat promptly once the liquid comes to a boil to avoid searing your hand. I have no other complaints about it. It looks nice and cleans up easily in my opinion."
2,Handle gets HOT!,"The handle does get very HOT on this kettle. It makes me wonder if the designer ever tried this out after making it. The whistle is very quiet and inconsistent in its noise output. If you have lots of water in the kettle, yes it is loud, but if you have just a couple of cups you can not hear it in the next room.It is well made but always very hot on the handle."
5,This is an incredible teapot. Outstanding deal too.,"Beautiful, elegant teapot. Finely crafted stainless steel teapot that works great. I use it on a gas stove. It heats quickly. Easy to fill and pour. It is also an incredible buy.....right now it is less than half-price. It should last forever too."
5,KitchenAid tea pot review,I bought the KitchenAid 2 quart gourmet essentials brushed stainless steel kettle. It is very substantial and I am very happy with it.
2,It's okay.,Got this to use on a glass top stove. Takes forever to heat and you can barely hear it whistle. Might be better for a coil burner or gas stove.
2,Function Follows Form,"It's difficult for a kettle not to do what it's supposed to do which is to heat water and pour easily. However, I think there are some flaws that only allow me to give this product 2 stars.The primary issue I have with this kettle is that the silicone grip on the handle does not cover the entire handle and leaves some of the stainless steel exposed. With a gas stove, the heat can rise to also heat the handle. When lifting the kettle from the stovetop, the tendency is to grip the entire handle and not just the silicone portion. The same goes for the lid and the spout which I think is positioned in a rather tight spot and too close to exposed steel.The pros -- it's stylish and holds a fair amount of water. However, I think this kettle is about design and less about pragmatic function."
3,"Very nice, but the whistle is awful",This kettle is very made well and from a quality standpoint it's fantastic. But the whistle sounds like fingernails on a chalk board. Not a great way to start the day.
4,Great Tea Kettle,"I really like this tea kettle. It looks great, but my favorite part is that it has a one piece base. The whistler opens easily and sounds nice. It is easy to pick up and easy to pour. The only drawback is that it is hard to fill through the spout as it doesn't open up as far as some other models."
2,Not long lasting,"I was given this kettle as a gift about nine months ago. It was used two-three times per day to heat water for tea. It worked fine but the handle got too hot to hold without hot pads if left on to boil for more than a minute or two. The whistle feature fell out of the holding about a week ago so it wouldn't whistle when the water reached boiling. I just left it on the stove for a couple of minutes too long and the water evaporated and the rubber around the handle base melted. Lovely.Overall, it was a good looking kettle but didn't hold up to repeated wear and tear. It would probably be fine if you aren't hard on things and don't use frequently. It was also hard to keep clean. I am now looking for a stainless electric kettle now that won't give off a plastic smell."
2,Looks are deceiving,"While this kettle is pretty to look at, its functionality is questionable. Since you cannot fill the kettle more than halfway without risking complete boil-over, the ""2 quart"" size is doubtful. I find that you cannot keep the whistle/stopper open for any extended period of time because of the way it's designed; the lid prevents the mechanism from going back far enough to remain open. Pouring from the kettle is awkward, usually requiring two hands (one to hold the kettle, one to hold the stopper open). The whistle itself sounds like something being strangled and/or ready to explode, depending on how much water is in it. If you only want one or two cups of tea and don't mind the occasional steam burn when pouring the water, this kettle is for you. This is the first time I have been disappointed in a Kitchenaid product. Here's hoping it's an aberration."
1,Disaster....,"What a disappointment!At first I loved this kettle. It's beautiful, and worked well for us. I didn't even mind that it was a bit difficult to fill. Then the plastic pads that secure the handle melted. The plastic poured down the sides of the kettle and onto my stovetop. Now the handle wobbles back and forth. I guess the kettle is scrap metal. Such a bummer! And a waste of money."
1,Safety Issue - Should be Recalled!,"Kettle has rubber pads on the handle and where the handle meets the kettle is also rubber. After about 3 weeks of use on a gas 5-burner stove the rubber pads started to melt and shoot hot molten rubber around the kitchen! There is permanent damage to my stove top and a safety concern as my wife tried to remove the kettle from the heat. The rubber dripped all over the stainless kettle and ruined it. Don't buy. I was wondering when I bought it how rubber and heat would work, guess I found out the hard way. This kettle could injure someone, I see a lawsuit in the works it they don't pull this item from store shelves!"
3,Doesn't work on induction cooktops,"I was puzzled that my new stove kept blinking at me when I tried to heat water for the first time in the kettle. I had assumed that all stainless would work on the induction cooktop. It doesn't. The stainless has to be ""magnetic"" and the steel of this kettle isn't. Regretfully, I'm having to send it back."
2,handle gets too hot,"I really wanted to love this kettle. It looks good, weighs nicely, holds a decent amount of water, but everytime I actually let it get to a whistling boil, I have to pull out a pot holder to use it or I get burned by the handle. The metal edges get ridiculously hot since the rubber grips do not go all the way around, and it is really awkward to try to hold it so my hand doesn't touch the metal parts. If it just went a little closer to the edge it would work."
3,Not bad for the sale price,"I bought this on the Friday Sale for $25 (I think). For that price it was well worth it, but the regular price of $175 is not worth it. It could be a bit ""Thicker"" as some of my diver's watches fit kind of tight, but all in all it's something I'd been looking for for a while and fits the bill nicely."
2,Broken zipper,"The Watch Box did its job, for a less than a year, of very rare trips, before the zipper gave out. I cannot, in good faith, recommend the item with sub-par quality components to carry fine watches."
4,Just what I'd hoped for...,"My order for Thyromine came shortly after I requested it and I took a dose immediately. My energy level greatly improved and my cravings decreased within the first two weeks. Even though my thyroid levels are fine, I continue to take Thyromine as it has helped me to focus. I still have sluggish days on occasion and am taking D3 to help with those, but will definitely be reordering Thyromine when my second bottle is close to empty."
2,no results,it's been almost a month and I have yet to see any results from taking this overpriced supplement. live and learn
3,A little confused.,"The title is a bit misleading. I ordered this thinking I would be getting a package containing six five-pound containers. But what you accutally get is just one five-pound container. "" Still no sure why it is ""sold in packs of 00006."" Just thought to let others know."
3,Water-proof or just plain broken?,"I bought this as my first vibrator. It worked GREAT for about 3 wks. I even tried it in the bathtub. Shortly after, I started hearing this clicking noise and it would not max. vibrate. The whole thing kept getting slower and had more noise until it just quit one day. Although I liked it, I am not going to risk that again and so will buy from a diff. company."
2,waterproof my eye.,"I used this product a grand total of two times before it stopped functioning. First I started in the shower but moved out of it; I noticed a small amount of water inside the battery housing. I removed the batteries and let it air dry. The second time I used it wholly within the shower and submerged it within the tub which, since it was marketed as waterproof and all, I figured I could do. (i even jammed it shut as hard as possible before operation.) My session ended with no malfunction, but when I opened it up, there was a lot more water in the housing, some of it on the batteries. I towelled it off as best I could, removed the batteries again, and let it dry for several days.Now, it won't come on at all. Switching batteries did nothing. I guess 'waterproof' translates to 'leaky utensil' in German, which is very unfortunate.. I like the design, the quiet motor and the material. Maybe I'll keep it around in its stunted form, but I'm extremely disappointed overall."
1,The worst book of its kind for this topic,"I once owned this book and do not recommend it to anyone for any reason. I have several books of this topic and this book is by far the worst of the bunch. No details on planning, design, installation or support of network cabling. Just some worthless pictures on how the network cabling looks and works. If there is any redeeming factor to this book it almost shows how to crimp a RJ45 plug onto the end of a wire, but almost doesn't count and its not redeeming for this book.I sold this book at an internet auction and I was glad to get rid of it for postage. Do not buy."
4,Great Reflection,"John Mayall is a great artist in his own right. This album is much more reflective than normal but contains so many tracks that show how good Mayall is (but 4 stars may be slightly high). His harp, piano and organ standout as does the guitar of Buddy Whittington. The album features a variety of styles: Dead City, Blues for the lost days, It ain't safe which feature the excellent guitar of Whittington. Trenches, One in a Million and You are for real, How can you live like that which show the refective and sentimental aspects of this album (with some Jazz tones)."
5,Lou Reed's Greatest Album,"This album is the greatest ever made by Lou Reed.Here you can hear that this guy is not only someone who can make (sometimes beautiful) noise, but has great musical talents.The album forms an unity, the tracks have something in common.Also his sense of (sometimes morbid) humour can be heard."
5,Nice windows,MS Windows 95 is the most proficient book available currently. The best guide to get u through learning and interacting with your PCs.
4,"bad,bad,bad",1.long pauses 2.very slow game 3.Medrith Vieira is not nice at all 4.game freezes right when you awnser the $100 question correctly.My freakin' game freezes some times on the million dollar question.OMG!What a stupid game.For freezing me up!But anyway this game is educational.Not like the mobile app.
3,I Guess I Will Not Be A Millionaire On This Game,The game was alright but it was not as exciting as I thought it would be. It would have been nice if there had been a way to play before I purchased to determine if it would be something I would really enjoy playing. The questions are really hard!!!
1,Who Wants to be a Millionaire,"Questions are too easy, and it is the old edition of Millionaire. I was looking for the new version."
4,Who Wants To Be A Millionaire with Meredith Viera,"Since purchasing this game in early July of 2008, I've only played it once and that was July 4th (It's hard to get people to sit down today to play a DVD game show. I've always like the Millionaire game show so naturally I enjoy the game. I was surprised by the difficulty of some of the early questions such as the $200 and $300 questions but all in all it's fun and educational. What I am curious to know is how the phone a friend will work? That, and polling the audience are two lifelines not used so far in playing the game."
3,Not great but not awful,"The game is designed for two to four players. After each question,Merideth asks who got it right and if anyone decided to walk away,which slows up the game. One can play, but will have to enter theminimum two player option and purposely give a wrong answer forone of the players to be eliminated. It comes with the threelifelines, but NOT the ""switch the question"" lifeline. I actuallywon the million the first time I played it. Overall, a decentgame. I give it a 6 out of 10."
2,Nice Idea But Misses The Mark,"I bought this DVD game thinking it would be more like the show and exciting to play. To a certain extent it is. But we found the game too easy and there are no options to make the questions harder. So when four of us played the first time and nearly every time after at game night, we all became millionaires -- if only it were that easy in life. We also noticed that the game stalled between questions but that might be because we have a DVD player from 2001. We also found that the questions began to repeat as early as the second game. That took away a lot of the excitement too. If kids are playing and the adults dumb down, it is the perfect game. Even then I may be insulting kids. For all adults, not such a good game."
2,the memoirs of colonel john s. mosby,"Sorry just was not my kind of book,was very dry to read,but if you are interested in his detail life they you may enjoy.I also only read around 50 pages on the kindle."
1,Poor Execution,"Without a doubt, this is the worst edited publication I have ever read. While the information contained in this book is valuable, the editorial missteps and omissions are maddeningly distracting. Some examples include sentences that don't finish with periods, formulas with typos, poorly reproduced graphics, mathematical errors (in the examples!), objects omitted from sentences, and a contour map that requires a mirror to decipher (figure 3-5). As a teaching tool, this text inspires confussion and frustration rather than delivering clarity and instruction. A 4th edition might correct the many errors, but this edition is far too expensive for it's lack of professionalism."
1,big mistake,"this text is filled with so many errors. sentences end in the middle of an explaination leaving you without any conclusion. this text is a required purchase for my landscape construction class at my university and i can't believe the errors have not yet been corrected! without a knowledgeable instructor to correct the many errors, this book will confuse anyone who is trying to learn from it. i do not recommend this book."
2,"The only one of its kind, unfortunately","I know one of the authors; he was actually a professor of mine before he retired. I know that he knows his stuff, so I'm praying that this mess of a book is the fault of the publisher.The typos alone make this text incomprehensible. Add to that illegible diagrams and a complete disorganization between text and headings, and you end up with headaches from just trying to read this silly thing. Unfortunately, this text is the only one of its kind, as far as I can tell.This book is meant as a comprehensive landscape architecture construction text for students and professionals and covers everything from grading to irrigation to structural load, although not deeply enough to be your only reference."
3,Don't buy it new!,"It is unbelievable that this book is $80. I agree with the other reviewers that this book falls short of what a professional reference should be, and the typos are plentiful. For the money, Time Saver Standards is a much better buy.Unfortunately, there are not a lot of other good options for a construction reference at the time being, so if you run across a cheaper copy of this book it still might be worth picking up. Though none of the topics are treated with great depth, it does manage to get the ideas across and could be helpful for someone just entering the profession or needing a general refresher.This book is just a very basic overview of construction, and other supplemental references about the topics covered would definitely be a must."
2,Very disappointed!,"Most of the illustrations are hard to recognize, the print is so bad! For some illustrations, I had to find the hardcover version to see what's in there, and I had to draw them on my book just because those on mine look like the blank paper! I just used it one day, some pages have already begun to fall because of the gel problem."
5,"Strong, sensitive type..","These gloves are comfortable enough to wear all day. My hands have never sweated in these.You actually forget you have them on. And they look like weight lifter's gloves, for that proper ""macho"" garden presence.They are responsive enough to be able to pull up a single blade of grass, yet protected my hand from a glancing blow from a machete! (this test performed by professional idiot on closed course) Do not try this at home!Love this 21st Century technology!"
3,"Booksellers ""get it""!!!!","This did not hold my interest BUT:Honest description, speedy shipping and good condition make happy customers!! I'm one!!Booksellers need to give seminars on how to please"
4,A little bit of WWII Britain,"These charming, understated, funny, and not infrequently heartbreaking stories give us a glimpse into life in home-front Britain during the Second World War. They are largely written about people of the upper middle class (and their associations with servants and working class evacuees)--people who had wartime jobs with the government or the armed services, and those who had the trying job of trying to hold things together as people and supplies disappeared. They are therefore often, but not exclusively, about women.If you enjoyed ""The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society,"" of which I was reminded by this set of stories, then you will very likely enjoy ""Good Evening Mrs. Craven."" Highly recommended."
5,A Journalist's WWII Short Stories,"Carefully limned stories about life for women on the homefront in England during WWII. With great economy, the stories describe the changes and challenges faced--living with evacuees, coping with the lack of menfolk, dealing with shortages of food and just about everything else, the comraderie of the Blitz, and economic and social dislocations. Journalist Mollie Panter-Downes skillfully portrays in fiction what she herself experienced and wrote about in her Letters From London in The New Yorker."
5,Great stuff,"I love Perez Prado, he was a true original and one of a kind, a Mexian genius. These recordings are from the 60's so the recordings are better and cleaner than a lot of his earlier stuff. However, for my money, his best album is STILL and always will be Havana, 3AM, a classic."
4,Great....but,"The seat is innovative and worked well for my short meditations (30-60) minutes. After that, it was pretty much like any other seat...uncomfortable for me. However, my friend (who purchased one on my recommendation) had much better luck than I did and is still raving about it. I'm still recommending it, but it's not the miracle chair that I had hoped it would be."
4,I LIKE THE SEAT...,"I LIKE THIS SEAT AND CONSIDER IT TO BE REASONABLY PRICED. THE COMPANY MAKES SEVERAL DIFFERENT MODELS OF THIS TYPE OF SEAT AND THIS IS THE MOST ECONOMICAL. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE THE INVESTMENT, YOU CAN ALWAYS SIT WITH A CUSHION ON THE FLOOR...HOWEVER, THIS SEAT WAS DESIGNED TO HELP MAINTAIN YOUR POSTURE, WHICH, MANY BUDDHIST TEACHERS BELIEVE IS IMPORTANT WHEN MEDITATING. THIS SEAT ALSO COMES WITH A LITTLE PAMPHLET FROM THE COMPANY TELLING HOW IT WAS INVENTED. HOWEVER, WHEN YOU RECEIVE THE SEAT, THERE IS NO RETURN CARD FROM THE COMPANY ASKING YOU TO RATE THE PRODUCT IN TERMS OF SATISFACTION, QUALITY OR COMFORT.. MANY COMPANIES LIKE FEEDBACK, BUT NONE IS ASKED FOR WITH THIS PRODUCT."
4,OK. I'd recommend them because of the price,"Great ESD bags for the price. Haven't used them for long, so no comments on durability."
2,Don't bother,"I was not happy with this product. Too small, fur not soft enough, bought for a 5 yr old and don't think she was overly thrilled with it either. I have purchased other similar products and was happy with them. I would not recommend."
4,The Golden Retriever that changed a family,"Star, a registered Golden Retriever who is a cherished house dog is stolen by strangers and then abandoned when she is pregnant with her first litter of puppies in a snowstorm. She finds an abandoned badger hole and bears her puppies there. When they are three weeks old Greg, a farmer, finds her and two of her puppies and takes them home.Shelley, Greg and Sheina's daughter confined to a wheelchair after a terrible accident in which her husband is killed, has moved in with her parents along with her 6-year-old son, Dannie. Star, who is extremely intelligent, bonds with Shelley and Dannie. Star helps Shelley to see the possibility of a future and helps Dannie to deal with his grief from losing his father.I would have given this story a five-star rating, except for the terrible times Star when through before Greg found her."
2,Can't recommend,"I've been through two bands on this watch so I have to think now that it isn't of good quality. I like everything else about the watch...it is lightweight, the band is comfortable, etc. BUT, the band easily breaks near the watch face unit. I've been through 2 in 2 years! $33 a pop to fix it."
2,Battery went dead after two months.,I have previously purchased Skagen watches and they performed very good. The Brown Mesh watch went dead only two months after I received it. Skagen is a supposedly Denmark product. On the back of this one it said made in China. Go figure!
4,Very good watch,"This watch is everything everyone says it is; small, sleek, and stylish. I would recommend it to just about anybody. My only complaint is that minor scratches show on the edges of the face, because it's only anodized. But, it is a great watch anyways, and it's unnoticable unless you really scrutinize it."
3,Comfy- Good price,This sandal was a great buy! I love Aerosoles and finding it for this price was a treat. Good looking and comfort! One couldn't ask for more!
4,Great Forgotten Show,"This show ran a bit shorter than Schmidt and Jone's Fantasticks- but it was a better show. Nash's Rainmaker was a perfect vehicle for a musical and Inga Swenson as Lizzie was brilliant. It's a shame she only did a few shows before reaching fame on TV in Benson. Now, Robert Horton was already famous on TV when he did this show and afterwards he happily returned (never to try singing again). The supporting cast was great, particularly Stephen Douglass.Don't miss this great score."
1,yawn...,"when this type of mindless ultra-violence is repeated over and over and over again it just gets boring. Oh boy, he punched a guy in the head, I wonder if his head will explode like the other thirteen opponents... guess so. Imagine this, over and over again and you have ""Fist of the North Star"" in a nutshell. The plot is nothing special. The animation is not top-notch. Still, some of the characters were half-way interesting... until they died brutally with lots of arterial spray."
1,It SUCKED!,"I was rather disappointed by this film. I suppose the only unpredictable thing about it is that the ""Fist of the North Star"" himself always loses the big fights. The English dubbed dialogue was flat, awkward and just plain lame. Plenty of gore (exploding body parts-- particularly heads), one nude scene. If that does it for you, go buy it. Otherwise, save your money for something better."
5,It's a Classic!,"What can I say the storyline and inovative plot is great. Who can say their rival poked thier fingers threw your body, stole your girl, and threw you off a cliff(Non Metaphysically). Then you got up and beat him to death. Bloody action the way it was meant to be seen."
5,Old school anamation VS new. New cant compare.,One of the 1st japanamation movies i ever saw. Excellent nothing like this. I collect anime had over 1000dollars worth of movies until my apt was robbed they took 4-5 boxes of anime. Ive been trying to find the fist so here i am.
5,Love it or Hate it....,"Whichever side you're on, you can't deny that Fist of The North Star is satisfying to watch. Fact is, the world would be a much better place if martial artists like Kenshiro actually existed. Kenshiro represents something truly fictional; kindness towards good but weak people, and extreme cruelty towards strong and bad people. In the world we live in, particularly in the typical american high school, its the other way around. Sad thing is, if a martial artist like Kenshiro actually existed and executed his brand of justice on evil people, he would be demonized by the media because the more powerful, fortunate and cruel among us would be threatened by him. I guess that, despite the fact that the voice acting is terrible, the animation horrible, and the effects downright cheezy, people love this move because Kenshiro represents an impossible ideal."
5,An Animated Splatter Fest!!!!!!!!,"It's real shameful that Japanimation isn't given the recognition and credit that is long overdue. Don't get me wrong I love Disney animation but if Japanimation films could just get a huge opening and premiere like Disney's animated films maybe film lovers will finally see the light and wondrous,loving hard work that goes into these animated beauties.""Fist of the Northstar"" is a wonder to behold in the world of Japanese animation. Extremely violent with a decent storyline and the dvd just adds to the beauty of this animated classic. Give this movie a chance and you'll love it!!!"
5,One of the Best,"This is properly the best Animation avaiable, the Storie line is great! If you are a Fan of Japanese Animation,this is A MUST HAVE!!!!It really is an Epic Assault on the Senses"
5,One of the best Anime's I've seen.,"One of the best anime's I've seen. I saw all 152 Episodes in the English Laungage for sale on Ebay for $28,000.00 and its legit."
3,Pretty cool flick.,"Good movie, but I think a lot was lost in the dubbing. The dubbing makes the movie seem rather silly, whereas it was probably intended to be serious. A must-see if you like animated violence.I don't think it takes the cake for worst dub ever. The new Dragonball Z episodes from Funimation are much, much worse."
4,Good picture quality,Best print of Fist of the North Star I've seen on DVD and VHS. Looks great on Blu Ray and HDTV.
4,Fast Shipping / Interesting Movie,"I bought this mainly because my husband loves this movie, along with Ninja Scroll and Akira, it's one of his favorite animes. It was shipped super fast, like everything I buy from Amazon. Movie is put to DVD well, no problems with playback. It has some special features that are interesting, like the additional trailers, but we don't really buy movies for the extras."
5,BEST ANIME EVER,"Nuf said. This movie is one of THE classic anime. The characters in this movie are very deep, from the tortured soul of kenshiro fighting for good, and his brother Raoh, the ruthless conqueror. If you haven't seen it, the 20 bucks is WELL worth it."
3,Condition of new book from Amazon is not new.,"I realize that Amazon uses different shippers and stuff but I would not recommend buying this book from Amazon b/c, first of all, it took 6 days for it to ship to me when I have 2 day shipping and because I paid for a new one(direct from Amazon) and the copy I was shipped already had scratches and water damage on the inside pages although it was wrapped in clear plastic and supposedly new. This is not the first time where things like this have happened but I think this will be the last time. I am canceling my 2 day shipping and have decided to use other sources for my textbook and other book needs after my vouchers are used up."
3,book itself is good.,I like 'neuron to brain'.But this used book was not so good.Because it is used book. so I can't complain about this.
3,"SORRY, I FIND THIS BORING","BLASPHEMY! I AM BORED READING ENDLESS LISTS OF NAMES, BATTLE DETAILS AND DETAILS OF HOW A MAN WAS KILLED, ETC. AS FOR BUTLER'S VERSION OF THE BOOK, AS FAR AS I CAN TELL IT'S GOOD.PHYSICALLY, HAVING THE BOOK IN HARD COVER AND CLEAR LARGE PRINT IS A BIG PLUS.IN SUM, IF ONE IS A HOMER FAN, THIS BOOK MIGHT SERVE WELL. MY 3 STARS MERELY REFLECT MY 'TAKE'. YOU'D THINK THAT A GRAD FROM A PRESTIGIOUS COLLEGE WOULD WRITE A VERY DIFFERENT REVIEW!"
1,This is the Samuel Butler translation - not the Fagles translation,"Despite what's stated on this product page, this leather-bound Canterbury Classics edition of the Iliad and the Odyssey is NOT a translation by Robert Fagles. Rather, it's a one-volume Samuel Butler translation. I ordered it because the description said it was a two-volume Fagles edition, and am now returning it. Until the copy on this page is corrected, potential purchasers should be aware of what they're getting. My one-star rating is based on the misleading copy, not the quality of the translation."
4,Good but not consistent with other Halcyon Classic,"This is a wonderfully rich and poetic translation of Homer's two epics. It would be nice to have the Greek along with the English as was done with Latin and English inThe Aeneid, The Eclogues, and the Georgics in English and Latin (Unexpurgated Edition) (Halcyon Classics). However, the lack of the alternating language versions does make it easier to navigate. So, overall, this is an ideal way to have these classics handy for enjoyment anytime."
3,No Roman Titles,"Butler is a longstanding and famous translator of Homer. I find his translation to be quaint, and I personally have no problems reading some rather archaic turns of phrase. However, where this particular edition goes wrong--and I am not at all sure why Butler would have done this, nor am I a Homer scholar, so I don't care overmuch to find out--is that the Greek gods are addressed by their Roman titles. So, for example, Zeus is not the king of the gods, but ""Jove."" Even some of the mortals' names are treated the same way, e.g., Odysseus becomes ""Ulysses."" I can think of no good reason to do this. Not all Butler translations are this way, but this one is. Otherwise, if you don't mind converting the names in your head, or if you prefer the Roman titles, then this is a cheap and easy kindle read."
4,The Iliad & Odyssey,I am in the process of listening to the audio tapes of the Odyssey and find it fascinating to listen to while I am traveling. I read the book many year ago and this is more meaningful listening and make traveling enjoyable. I highly recommend listening to the book in this fashion.
5,Very happy with this book,After doing some research on what book I wanted from the several I browsed and checking user reviews I settled on this book. I don't mind the name but I do mind that the book serve the purpose I buy it for and this book serves that purpose to the T. It is very enjoyable to read and study. As far as I have read it (and I don't have much time to read) I have enjoyed every chapter of it and expect to continue enjoying it. I was sure glad I got it from Amazon. The price was right and the contents are what I wanted. The reviews helped a lot especially when they were of people who have bought the book.Happy studying!
2,Dissapointed,"Had this been the first book I read on Roger Williams, I might have enjoyed it more;however, I feel it is a weak attempt to present Roger Williams' beiefs and their evolution. There was way too much time spent learning of Edward Coke (although interesting, not the subject of the book). There is more to his leaving the Church of England that just being exiled from the Bay Colony. We get no religious philosophy; just political. Why did he found the Baptist Church in America and then leave it? Seven generations back he was my grandfather; he deserves a better telling. A much more filling work is Liberty of Conscience:Roger Williams in America, by Edwin S. Gaustad."
5,Great story about a great man in interesting times,"I learned that Roger Williams is a relative of mine so I wanted to learn about his philosophy and integrity. This book did not disappoint. In fact, I am now fascinated with history which I had not been before this book. The descriptions of the times and lives of the people are so well written about that I found myself wanting to continue the journey in time. Like I said, I am not a history buff but if you just want a good story of interesting events and people -this book has it."
2,WHAT!!!,this is not the best K-Os you can buy. Go buy Joyful Rebellion or some of his duets.With People like Dr.Dre of Rascalz.
5,Cam Jansen and the Ghostly Mystery,"I just read Cam Jansen and the Ghostly Mystery.In the beginning Cam, Aunt Molly and Eric were in line to get concert tickets for a T-Pops concert. A ghost came and scared everybody. He scared an old man, and he faked a heart attack. Meanwhile the ticket seller was robbed. Cam and Eric were looking all around. Did they find the robbers?"
5,shot calla,"this album is the best of the two ablums uder his belt. both shot calla and six figuers are tight but this one is one of my favorite albums. with the likes of studio ton, my favorite producers and d-shot on the boards its a yay area classic. it would of been a world wide classic if he had sam bostic on it. but overall it was real"
2,Mostly D-Shot singing.,This album isn't to great. Only 2 maybe 3 tracks D-Shot raps in. If ya like R&B you might like dis album because he sings a lot in Six Figures. Check out his other 2 albums he gots out right now. Both of the other ones are reel good. If you would like to contact me you can reach me at yuckplace@hotmail.com.
3,Just a printed version of accompanying documentation,"This book and vol 2 are nothing more than a printed versions of the documentation that comes with an installation of R -- and only for the base package. If that's what you want then these books are for you. Be aware that it is already out of date.While part of the purchase may be earmarked for development, perhaps it would be better to send all of the price of these two volumes directly instead."
3,disorder of descriptions,"I am a embeded linux programmer who want to make a chassis that processing ethernet packets. At that point of view, the contents is insufficient and disorder of descriptions. Hard to understand."
5,You'll never hear songbirds the same way again,"A magical, sensual brew of the mystic and the erotic, heavily peppered with Latin American magic realism. Funny, tragic and thought provoking, with enough plot twists to keep the lovers of pure story turning the pages. A great accomplishment."
4,It's big,"It is what I expected it to be. A coin with a squirrels nuts on it haha. It is nicely made and the painting is nice. My only issue is that, it's a little too big. Other than this, it is nice."
2,Poor design.,"It is annoying that installation instructions are not included. However, their customer support is very helpful.The shims are too large for the top bracket to be installed. To be able to squeeze the bracket around the tubing with the original length shim is next to impossible. To install it, we shortened the shim by 1/3"". If you are able to install the bracket with the original shim, you run the risk of the nut coming out due to the stress on the plastic. Further, the idea of the nylon webbing to secure the seat makes my uncomfortable."
1,Baby jogger carseat adapter,"No instructions were included, but found online; they stated you merely remove screws & attach the adapter...however, the stroller is put together entirely with rivets, requiring drilling them out. Our conclusion: just strap the carseat to the stroller, resting it on the tray, it is just as secure."
3,it's time to shyne . . .,"if you haven't heard this, you are going to be shocked. sean combs has recently signed a biggie soundalike who appears on the remix of total's 'sittin' home'. don't be fooled. the joint is phat, though, and total can't be faded."
1,beto grupero,no desperdisien su dinero en es te disco noes por las cansiones sino como lo grabaron no tocan lacansion completa como un minuto en cada cansion
2,"Good idea, bad execution","The problem with this book is not the content; Chansky's stories are often interesting. The real problem is that Chansky has serious problems with the English language. Scarcely a page goes by without a mangled mixed metaphor or breathless cliche. If you're a Carolina fan though, you probably won't notice."
3,How do I feel about this book?...,"...I don't really know, that's why i rated it with 3, i'm not sure i liked it, but i'm not sure I disliked it. Different? yes, very different, very creative and original. The book starts ou very well, but half way thru it started to feel heavy and the more I read the more i wanted drop it but at the same, finish it. I guess it was too much in the same plate so i felt like at the end didnt make any sense or didnt come to a resolution, it was just sort of like a period of time on pages, i still wanteed to read some ending. It started out with one character that you get to know and then he died and another character is now starring. It was like Aldiss started writing and just adding more and more ideas without a trace of facts in the same story. But yes, even so, you want to read, it was a weird experience reading this book, i can't relly recomend it, but it's there. If you like this kind of books, go ahead read it, but dont expect too much."
4,Science Fiction or Fantastic Fiction?,"This whole world feels much more like Alice in Wonderland than Science Fiction. In fact, most of the science in this book is so implausible that I think this would have been a much better book without it. Although the story seems to be driven by the science, which weakens it, the setting more than makes up for it. So fantastic, beautiful and deadly, I kept yearning for a less epic story without getting disturbed by implausible explanations. But the setting was so powerful that nothing could take it away, so in the end I have to give it four stars."
2,"limited originality in insights, non-personal in wstyle","A collection of essays reflecting on the existential meaning of suffering, this book offers only limited original insights not already found in countless Bible commentaries, theology texts or devotional literature. The author chooses to use a psychologically remote and emotionally disengaged third-person writing style, that removes much of the human personality from his writing on this highly personal subject. I find C. S. Lewis or John Goldingay much more engaging and provocative."
4,Nice Resource for Nurse Managers,"This is a well organized resource for nurse managers. I bought it for MSN classwork, but have decided to keep it for future reference at work. The text is organized well and provides a basic level of accounting understanding along with budgeting concepts."
5,Classic Elegance,The Mikasa Lavender Lane dinnerware set is an excellent set of everyday dishes that also works for dinner parties.The colors and design are elegant and vibrant. The background white shimmers. The rectangular shape really works and is always good for a compliment from our guests.The Mikasa rectangular serving platter is a very nice complement.Mikasa Lavender Lane Rectangular PlatterWe have to wash our fine china by hand but this Mikasa place setting is both microwave and dishwasher safe. The fine china is likely to stay in the cabinet for all but the major holidays.
4,Malt Whisky File,"Great Book!!!!! Came on time. This is one of the best books for novice scotch drinkers. You learn a lot about the where, the how, and the different regions!"
3,Three Stars for Holly Palance,"This is a pretty bad movie. Filmed and (I think) financed in South Africa.There's only one reason to see this: Holly Palance. She's not even the female lead, if I remember right, but she's smokin' hot in this movie. She's Jack Palance's daughter and used to host ""Ripley's Believe It or Not"" with him. She was also the nanny who hung herself in front of the birthday party in the original classic, THE OMEN (1976) and she was one of the wives in THE BEST OF TIMES.Anyway, if you ever wanted to see, to put it more nicely, a more sensual side of her, check this movie out. The overall movie is pretty bad but if you had a thing for Holly, you won't care."
4,Mercedes Sosa sings Violeta Parra,A bit melancholy but good if you like protest and melancholic music. Definitely for listening to when you are feeling good - not when a bit sad or depressed! Certainly not lift-you-up music.
2,narrow paths,"This book can make for a ok discussion in a group setting or small class, but it is bit narrow at times. moore presents a narrow path to god strictly from a males perspective. i believe the path to God lies within in us all. narrow thinking leads to narrow paths and few choices."
5,book review,This book was spectacular. It provides a lot of very helpful information regarding the ins and outs of being a clinical reasearch coordinator and would be very helpful for both those just inquiring about the industry and those already in it.
1,"LOVE Amazon, but beware when buying used products","I ordered a used book so I shouldn't have expected the most recent publication but I think it's deceiving when the book I got didn't even have the same picture as the one I ordered. The book I received was from 2004. Hopefully, the laws haven't changed much since then and I can still pass my test."
1,DONT DO IT,I am embarrased that someone is looking at this page and considering reading the cliffnotes for one the the best (and not to mention shortest) pieces of american literature. Try to use your brains for something other than reality television and choosing a fast food joint. Its not all that hard to read this book and understand it. ENJOY!
2,soap opera,"This is a 150 year old soap opera, not my cup of tea, but it would make good reading for someone who enjoys that type of material, or someone researching how novels were written so long ago. Historically speaking, the author lived in my part of the country, and I chose to read it to see what she was all about. She did start teaching school at 13, and she was considered mad when 10 years old because she spoke openly to invisible people."
5,A lifetime plan,"This program gives a body, mind, and spiritual (soul) intensive in a sensible and interesting manner. It is delivered by the doctor who gave us Brain Longevity, and it is no wonder that it follows through with a complete and doable program aimed indeed at pain in the human body. He absolutely and logically proves that pain does not exist alone at the site of the pain, but lives within us. It is a thoughtful, and non-invasive book. I feel this book is always there for me, as a reference and a thoughtful,research-based and compassionate friend."
5,LIFE CHANGING BOOK,"This book is amazing!! I could not believe FINALLY someone put into words what I was feeling but could not express! (1st chapter) His suggestions are so logical. He is a wonderful dr. and I hope he is educating others in his way of thinking. This is a ""must read book"" for anyone with chronic pain!!"
2,The book lacks authenticating detail,"This is a small book, made even smaller by omitting pictures, sketches, diagrams and references. It is not worth even the low Amazon cost."
2,Book thrown together with little effort,"This book appears to be thrown together without a lot of effort, i.e., it has no photographs, no illustrations, no maps, no index, and no bibliography.Anyone with a strong interest in the subject should try to find a copy of the older book by Nat Barrows, ""Blow All Ballast""."
4,Would benefit from diagrams,"I found this an exciting book that I did not want to put down. ""Swede"" Momson's story is inspiring and well worth reading. However, it was very hard to visualize what was being described, and diagrams of the submarine layout as well as placement of the pontoons would have made the story far easier to follow."
3,A fitting tribute,"As a scuba diver, I found this memoir of a remarkable man, indeed a heroic man, to be a fittng tribute to his life and the contributions he made the the science of underwater exploration. Peter Maas has corrected an oversight of history and crafted a stirring tale of the sea."
5,One of the great stories in naval history,"I've long been a fan of the late Peter Maas. I liked Serpico and Underboss, and now this riveting military history about the Squalus submarine. This is a satisfying story as well, not just because of the successful rescue operation but because the good guy (""Swede"") prevailed. Swede's leadership as portrayed by Maas was stunning. I think almost anybody would appreciate this book."
5,Remarkable story of disaster at sea,This book is expertly written by a very popular author and contains every emotion you can imagine. It's a true life story of a dangerous rescue at sea set off the New England coast. It's hard to put this book down. It's as exciting as the most well written mystery. It's truly one you will remember.
2,Major Disappointment,"I love reading these type books and hearing these stories, but ""The Terrible Hours"" was difficult to get thru and was more of a tribute to Swede Momson than the actual rescue of this doomed submarine. I found myself skimming thru pages of technical mumbo jumbo about Momson's experiments in order to read about the actual rescue itself.And the lack of a few diagrams of the interior and exterior of the Squalus, made the book all the more difficult to really understand and grasp the entire story."
4,A Haunting Tale,"As I write this review, the world waits to hear of the fate of the Russian submariners aboard the Kursk. When the news first broke, I immediately thought of this book and Swede Momsen. That same night, my sister called me and said, ""Have you heard? 'The Terrible Hours' is happening all over again."" Neither of us had ever forgotten this book.Peter Maas does a terrific job of recounting Swede Momsen's career in the context of this spectacular rescue. You don't need to be interested in submarines or the Navy - just in what can be accomplished with creativity, persistence, and heroism.My one quibble is that I do agree with the reviewers who would like illustrations - that's why the four stars rather than five."
4,Kept me awake!,"This book on tape was perfect for a journey from Boston to Rochester, New York. I found the miles flying by as I was drawn ever deeper into the suspenseful crisis of a trapped submarine. Even though it was clear that some of the men survived, because of the amount of first-person information that was given, I still found myself on the edge of my car seat as the minutes ticked by and the air in the sub became more and more toxic and colder. If you're looking for examples of real heroism and human ingenuity, this is a story to savor."
3,A small rewrite of Maas's first book The Rescuer,"A great story that deserves to be told, but unfortunately this is almost a word-for-word copy of Maas's first book The Rescuer. At least that one had pictures of the S-4, S-51 and Squalus operations."
4,A mission to remember,"A very well written book, which makes you feel a part of the rescue and salvage mission. Bringing out the hard reality of the adverse conditions faced by swede and his team, specially when technology was not as advanced as today."
1,Writer in need of an editor?,"I was interested to learn about this true story but couldn't make it past the third chapter. The writing was terrible, or perhaps it was the editing that was at fault. Regardless, this was very poorly done. I'm sorry to say it, but it's so."
4,A Separate Peace,"A Separate Peace is an amazing book, which explores the innermost thoughts of mankind. There is rarely a dull moment in the book. The author does an excellent job of creating a closeness with the reader and the characters. This book has many symbols in it. A Separate Peace teaches great life long lessons. Its main purpose is to show that every person fight a war within themselves and they spend their lives defending themselves against this inner enemy. These inner changes take place regardless of what is happening in the world. I would highly reccomend this book to all teenagers, but guys specifically."
4,A good little read,"This is an enjoyable little book, even if it is largely a regeneration of earlier stories Maas had written on the incident and people involved. At least Maas acknowledges this in the book. Nevertheless, Maas tells the story in a factual, but easy style that is informative, yet fun to read."
4,Courage in Conviction,"Mr. Maas's book is not just an exciting, true-life tale, nor is it just a wonderful biography of an unknow Naval hero. It's a story of an individual who has vision and through sheer dint of personal fortitude, overcomes tremendous organizational inertia and every conceivable obstacle over the long haul to realize his goal.Although in a Navy setting, this story of courage translates to any worthy undertaking and serves as an inpiration.Excellent reading for teenagers who could use a little shot of ""Blue and Gold."""
4,Great Reading,"A great story about a man that few have really ever heard of. His calmness under pressure and his ingenuity are superb. They don't make them like that anymore. I wonder if under today's standards Mr. Momsen would be allowed the latitude and patience that was afforded him then. Again, a great story."
3,Review of 83 major works,"The same as about other monographs from the same series, e.g. ""Hans Scharoun (Studio Paperback)"" by J. Christoph Burkle.The only difference is that Philip Johnson was an active fascist sympathizer and active propagandist for the Nazi government, who had tried to implement fascism in USA for at least 8 years between 1932 and 1940. Details of this past are described in ""WE CANNOT NOT KNOW HISTORY:"" PHILIP JOHNSON'S POLITICS AND CYNICAL SURVIVAL by KAZYS VARNELIS in Journal of Architectural Education, November 1994 published also on the Internet, and also discussed at http://arch.designcommunity.com/viewtopic.php?t=3709."
5,Nothing here is left hanging,"If you look to the tracks of this disc is just beyond great, it's one of my favorite Silvio's ever. ""El mayor"" beautiful and respectful homage to Cuba's independence leader Major Ignacio Agramonte y Loynaz; ""Madre"" song dedicated to the heroic efforts to save motherland by vietnamese patriots against french and american imperialism; ""Santiago de Chile"" and ""Te doy una cancion"" painful first hand experience of Pinochet murderous coup; ""Pequena serenata diurna"" beautiful reflection of love put onto the historic perspective of social struggle; the very intimate and lyrical ""Yo digo que las estrellas"", ""Claro de luna"" y ""Esta cancion""; the fiercely critical ""La verguenza"", ""Sueno con serpientes"" and ""Dias y flores"". Believe me, you will need an extra copy to keep on listening to it!"
4,The Wounded Healer: Ministry in Contemporary Society,"It was ok, but not exactly what I was looking for. This book was written mainly for clergy , sothat they wouldn't burn out."
3,The Wounded Healer: Ministry in Contemporary Society,"I am reading this for a women's retreat and found the title very interesting. However,the beginning of it is quite clinical and as a Pastor I struggled with making a connection. With effort and a ""dictionary"" you can grasp the meaning of the nuclear man. Unfortunately, I did not gain any new insight or best practices in my approach to counseling or ministering to people. I found it an OK read and look forward to learning more from other at during the retreat discussion."
1,Contrarian,I have hated this book ever since I first read it. It is incredibly light in any kind of real thought; it provides no original insights. It is practically barren of any Scriptural references. I frankly am astounded that any Christian finds anything to like about this book.
3,Pretty good movie..... gay or straight........,"It's a cute movie, though not as humorous as I'd hoped..... it was different.... not a comedy about gays. Ryan and John both develop their characters well and show some 'real' emotions that can develop within couples. It seems to have been a more subtle intro to the gay community, not portraying them as total lunatics (i.e. Robin Williams, in Birdcage). The 'bad guy' is a horrible actor..... he came off too 'slapstick', but it didn't spoil the movie for me. I enjoyed the movie, but only once... gave it to a friend who had recommended it to me."
4,Partners,"Enjoyed this movie-first saw it when it was released in the theaters(1982),than purchased it when came out in video format(Beta and VHS). Had to wait long time for it to FINALLY-NOW!, be released in DVD format-VERY FUNNY,ENJOYABLE GAY COMEDY. It also point outs---helps the straight/hetrosexual(insight into the gay communtity and the relationship that exist within the homosexual community) sector of life.FUNNY,ENTERTAINING FOR ALL AUDIENCES-PARTICULARLY GAY AND GAY-FRIENDLY AUDIENCES!"
2,The Ezekiel Option,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. If Mr. Rosenbaum continues to go on with the path he has taken in this book, I certainly will never read any of his books again. Unless you are a Born Again Christian or Evangelical Christian, this book will turn you off. I was so anxious to read this book and so unhappy about it.Thank you."
1,Thinly disguised religious tract,"Short and to the point... If I wanted to read a religious tract, I would have done so. This is billed as a novel, a ""thriller"", and it is anything but that. If you want someone's interpetation of writings in the bible, then this is for you. If you want to believe that only Christians can be saved, all others doomed, then this is for you.If you want a thriller, a novel, a story that isn't a book length sermon, then by all means pass on this. I wish I had."
1,Lousy,"I read the Last Jihad, and was anxious to read the follow up books. However, the author spends so much time preaching his own personal beliefs that this book and Last Days become boring beyond belief. I was anxious to finish this book and would read the action parts of the book and skip the pages where the author went on and on about religion. If I wanted a book on religion or sprituality, I would have gone to that section of the bookstore.By the way, when I did get to the end of the Ezekiel Option, I was severely disappointed. I read my last of his books.Eric"
3,Deus Ex Machina,"If ever a book deserved the phrase ""deus ex machina"" this is it.There is absolutely no suspense of any kind in the book. From very early on, we are told that God will solve all the problems and all will be good in the world. (except for an untold number of 10's of thousands of deaths)This is the aspect that is used to sell the book and is the aspect that kills the book. To have God come down and save the day is cheesy. Such a method is looked down on in most books and other media."
1,CHICKEN LITTLE-SKY IS FALLING- UNBIBLICAL DRIVEL,"WHEN are these last days, escapist false prophets going to stop peddling fear and teach we are in the never ending, gates-of-hell-will-not-prevail New Covenant?"
5,A fiery welded to your seat novel.,"I just finished reading your latest book ""The Ezekiel Option"", the ""I couldn't put it down ""expression was never more true. You have been named ""Joel"" correctly and prophetically, as the Spirit of the Lord has been poured out upon you. I have been In both Moscow and Israel, so the pages became even more alive to me as I recounted my own experiences in both countries. These are truly amazing days as we daily see God's Prophetic Word come to pass. I was convinced in the 70's of the soon return of our Lord Jesus, I then began to see it wane in the minds and expressions of the Church at large. Now once again I see brothers and sisters in Christ catching the re-ignited flame of revealed prophecy. All you describe in this book is so relevant to these times. God bless you as you continue in His work."
4,Relevant For Today's World...,"This is an excellent book which manages to incorporate politics, history, current events, a love story, and Bible prophecy. It evolves into an intense and compelling thriller which, unfortunately, could also be prophetic in its own right. The fine line between reality and fiction is blurred, as many events have already transpired or are currently in motion.I don't believe this book would interest anti-Christians, or close minded liberals. For all others, I highly recommend."
5,The Ezekiel Option,If you are looking for an 'I can't put it down' book you needn't look any further. Rosenberg keeps you right on the edge of your seat. A GREAT read!
5,The Exekiel Option Book,"Again, I love this author and I want more of his writtings. He keeps you on the edge of your seat. This order arrived in great condition and on time."
2,Gets lost in the details,I had high hopes for this book. The storey starts off great but starts bogging down in the middle. The author constantly switches from subplot to subplot so that the storyline developes in a rather slow and choppy fashion.
1,Swimming in the shallow end,"I keep desparately hoping to come across intelligent evangelical fiction but I fear that is not to be. After the appalling Left Behind series(which only left behind your wallet but took all your money)I was determined not to buy any more of this genre. But, after hearing it praised by Rush Limbaugh, I relented and ordered it. What a waste. The characters are two dimensional, the plot is boring, the preaching is obvious and once again, I found myself swimming in the shallow end of the great literary pool of truly Christian literature. Where are the Graham Greenes and the Chestertons???? When dealing with the ultimate things i.e.,the battle of good vs. evil, eternity and salvation, can't we please expect more than the adult equivalent of the comic book Bible I bought for my 6 and 8 year old children???? Don't waste your money on this one. Just go re-read your old Clancey books."
1,"Preposterous, preachy claptrap","I had hoped this book was a ""DaVinci Code meets the Middle East Crisis."" Instead, when the plot thickened, the sermonizing began and was so ridiculously religious that I could barely continue. Being part masochist, I read through to the end and encountered the most preposterous last 8 pages of a book I've ever been sickened to read. Go to a book store and read the last eight pages and see for yourself. PLEASE don't waste your money on this piece of preachy claptrap."
1,Its Not Very Good,"Part thriller, part religious polemic Joel Rosenberg proves that you can't do both effectively in one book. Whats really painful is that he is not a bad writer. The prior two books in this series were good, solid reads. Thats why I bought this one and boy was I disappointed. His apparent recipe was 2/3rds thriller and 1/3 Religious content without any effort to blend the two. The result was an awkward and unbelievable tale with little redeeming value.I am amazed at the reviews praising this book. I cannot believe they read the earlier books in the series. I for one am finished with this author."
1,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE,"Most boring book I've read in a long time. If I wanted more info about prophesies and the ""last days"", I would read the Bible or the ""Left Behind"" series. This is a religious pamphlet disguised as a novel"
5,Ezekiel Option by Joel Rosenberg,"I have read all of Mr Rosenberg's books, and theEzekiel Option holds true for his most excellentstandard of novels based on hisorical biblicalfacts, as well as having tremendous suspense,holding the reader's attention rivetted on thecharacters and plot at all times. I am mosthappy and fortunate to have been able tohave these in my library."
5,Totally Believeable,"Following the action packed and Biblically accurate The Last Days and The Last Jihad, Rosenberg once again packs his latest End Times novel with non-stop action and credible characters. Once again good trihumps over evil. Bennett and McCoy are portrayed as vulnerable yet immensely strong and determined representatives of modern humanity.Rosenberg supplies endless (albeit at times tedious) evidence based on the Bible about just what happens, and will happen, to the world in the End Times. As a caveat, I'll confess I'm a believer and a student of Biblical prophecy, so I'm intrigued by the various End Times portrayed in Rosenberg's novels. Like his previous End Times novels, Rosenberg's Ezekiel Option kept me engaged and amazed. I believe the concept is totally credible. And the novel is a great and entertaining read!For Rosenberg fans, there's a not so subtle hint at the end of a ""coming soon"" follow-up involving Iraq and Babylon and more End Times excitement!"
5,The Ezekiel Option.,As A novel I would give 5 stars. It is a fast moving exciting Novel. In addition to that I felt I had just had a course in bible study. Since I am in a group that studies the bible I loved it. And learned from it.Thanks!Phyllis Gobin
5,awesome,"Great book by a great author. Book was exactly as described. Arrived slightly damaged, but no other wear or tear."
4,The Ezekiel Option: A Novel,Well written and definitely a page turner. Looking forward to reading other novels from Rosenberg.
3,New slant on current Middle East issues.,Not as good as Rosenberg's earlier books - The Last Jihad and The Last Days. Dialogue about Christianity was a bit too preachy and evangelical. But it may cause readers to do a bit of biblical research.
2,Lay off the preaching,"I grabbed this book in the library, as it sounded like a good ""take it on vacation"" read. And the first 1/4 of the book was. But by the halfway point, I was so turned off by the heavy proselytizing that it was tough to finish. I have no problem with books of all POV, but I don't like to be preached to. There were multiple scenes where the characters engaged in heavy Christ-oriented prayer sessions, that had nothing to do with the plot. If it advances the storyline, great. But these passages appeared to be inserted simply for the sake of evangelical prayer.This book gets a two-star (instead of one) because the story was ok, but geez (pun intended), ease up Joel. You seem like a decent writer, but this book will put you on my ""pass"" list."
5,The Ezekiel Option,An excellent read. My husband & I plus several friends have really enjoyed this book.
2,It wasn't what I expected....,"I am an avid reader and looked forward to THE EZEKIEL OPTION, having read Mr. Rosenberg's other two novels. However, this one is very different and not written in the same vein as the other two, even though this is a continuation.The overtly pentecostal Christian overtones were a bit much for me [ and yes I am a practicing Christian]. Mr. Rosenberg has changed publishers with this one - now using the same one as the LEFT BEHIND series. As a result, Mr. Rosenberg's entire premise amd writing style have changed.If you are a reader who likes political thrillers, this one is probably not for you. if you are a reader who enjoys 'end of days' novels, you wil love it!I have read my last book by this author."
2,No real live human-type people in this book..,"You would have thought that by his third book, Joel Rosenberg would have learned something about characterization and scene setting. But he hasn't.I never expected characters of the quality drawn by W E B Griffin or Bernard Cornwell, for that takes a master, but once again, I don't care whether Rosenberg's hero survives. Even when Bennett receives the severed finger of his fiancée, he has no emotional response.The whole plot uses a great deal of action to support what could happen if the Ezekiel prophecies came true. In this volume, no attempt has been made to hide the author's evangelical mindset, including a quotation of the 23rd Psalm in its entirety.I gave it the old college try. I read three of Rosenberg's efforts. I will now return to authors who write characters that make me care whether they live or die."
3,i feel like i am reading a book with the 700 club,i think this could have much less religious quotes. it was very hard to all of a sudden get into the story when all the quotes keep popping up. i think it would have been much better to eliminate them. i will finish reading it because the plot is great. just not happy with the quotes. i am not anti religious but this distracted me very much.
4,The Ezekiel Option: A Novel,"Well written, fast paced. Kept my interest. Wasn't particualarly a happy ending for those who like everything neately wrapped up. In fact, I was wondering if we were going to have another in the series type of book."
5,The Ezekiel Option was awesome!,I couldn't put it down. The end times prophesy's are Joel Rosenberg's forte'. Get the whole series! You won't be able to put it down!!
5,Great series of books,"This is the third book in a series of fiction books and is certainly an eye opener. The story line brings together many interesting characters, a lot of suspense, a little romance and thought provoking story lines. It is an excellent book which brings together Bible prophecy, politics, history, and current events. Because of the events in the Middle East going on now, I have to remind myself often that this is fiction and not reality, but the reader gets a grasp of Bible prophecy. As with most of Joel Rosenberg books, I did not want to put this book down. I am excited to know that when I do finish reading this book, book four in the series will be waiting."
2,NO comfort,"I bought this bra for its comfort strap feature but that's the worst thing about this bra. I wear a DD and the straps are too thin and really dig into my shoulders. The rest of the bra is very nice. The cups are nice and full and I think it truly is a ""minimizer"". Unfortunately, the straps are too painful for me to continue wearing the bra."
2,Not as good as JMS used to be,"The padded straps are only in front (probably just for the picture to pretend to have padded straps). The shoulder straps are not padded, and they cut into your shoulders badly. would NEVER buy again."
1,Been asked to review an item,"It would be nice to be able to give an impression of an item purchased a month and 5 days ago, IF I HAD IT TO TRY IT OUT THAT IS.There is still a glimpse of hope.... please ask me again in one month or so, may be then it finally arrived and I can tell you if it works OK.Until then, I will be wondering why on earth didn't I go to the local hardware store.Marc"
1,Authors / Title are deceptive,"THANKS FOR ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!!! Book claims in the description to have loads of charts and step by step instructions for remodeling .Personally i do not consider an example of a contract to be an example.Like in the section about replacing windows, now there is where a diagram is needed.Yes i may have been a sucker for buying the book, but the dummies are definitely the authors !!!!"
4,She Looks Like Beyonce :),"I got this Lea doll because with her tan, she looks just like Beyonce in the face. :) I'm not sure what ethnicity Lea is intended to be (Native American? Latina? African American?) but it doesn't matter because she is a very gorgeous doll. I recommend her also because she has the newer Barbie body mold (more Bootylicious) and it is more realistic mold than the previous Barbie body."
3,"Great, but there is a problem","This comforter looks very rich and elegant on the outside - the problem is underneath the filling weedles it's way through the comforter and pills-up in bunches to looks absolutely horrible. This happened within a week and I can't seem to remove the pills, at least for any length of time anyway. Beautiful, but I would only put it on a bed that was never used and was seen for decoration only. The comforter is soft and warm, and otherwise well-made, but the pilling problem is a huge deterrent"
3,Not his best,"I have seen Chris Duarte live a number of times and neither of his discs even begins to approach what he does live. Nevertheless, both of his offerings are very good and worth having. His first CD; however, is the better of the two and more similar to what you get live. If you ever get a chance to see him live, don't pass it up - he is awesome."
2,"Sorry, but this one's a dissapointment","I was gonna give it three stars but then I popped in Texas Sugar and demoted this one even further. A couple of good songs, but like many other artists, tried a bit too much of the funk and lo-fi rap drum garbage. Really ruins these songs by a very talented player. Buy Texas Sugar... Outstanding!! Hope there will be more from Chris."
3,I agree - Not his Best,"Chris has a much more ""funky"" feel on this CD. His first (texas sugar strat magic)showed what Chris is - one great guitar player. This just doesn't grab you like his first. It's not bad. I have both in my drawer at work. When I go to listen to them, I pick his first 90% of the time. Parts of it show a hint more Hendrix than SRV, but there seems to be a pinch of Prince in here as well. I'm still waiting for Chris to come to Ohio. I understand he is fantastic live. His web site is also cool with lots of downloadable music."
2,cute but painul,this shoe is just perfect with everything but when you walk with it for a long time your toes will hurt w/the wooden sole... Just to painful.. good for short distance walking.
5,this really does work,"i have porcelain veneers that are sensitive to stain, and i have to say that this is the first over-the-counter preparation that i have ever found, and it really worked fast. within the first four days of using the gel, i saw a marked difference. i use it last thing at night before going to sleep, and so far so good."
4,small but wonderful package,"So the film is only 17 minutes in length? Who cares. It's quality here, not quantity, that matters. The viewer is assaulted with a barrage of iconclastic images - the severed eye, dead donkeys, etc. - that haunt the mind indelibly. Anyone whose attended film schoool has seen Un Chien Andalou. It's not jusy a 'artsy' masterpiece, but it's a lesson in visual storytelling and editing. Luis Bunuel has influenced many great directors, including David Lynch and Pedro Almodovar. The bonus feature included in this DVD, Slice of Bunuel, is excellent. Juan Luis Bunuel (Luis's son)sheds some interesting light on the film, his key point being - I believe - Un Chien Andalou was meant to defy interpretation. This is why this film begs to be watched repeatedly. I guess it's natural to imbue things with one's own special meaning, even if this film was meant to have no meaning at all."
5,"Amazing, Extreme, Bizzare, Fun,","This is the Granddaddy of all expermental avant-garde films. It is a must for all film-buffs. And, it will definitly make you say HUH????"
1,What??,"It seems like this film is not my cup of tea, or maybe I'm missing something, am I? I know that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but this beholder couldn't find any beauty in this film. I try to be open minded when it comes to art, but I also think that there's a fine line between art and rubbish, and to me this film classifies as the latter one.The reviewers can talk as much as they want about surrealism and Freudian stuff, but to me Un Chien Andalou is nothing but a pile of nonsense, a complete waste of my time. It lasts only 17 minutes, just as well! I loved Bunuel's Le Charme Discret de la Bourgeoisie and that's the reason why I picked this film. I should have known better, Salvador Dali is part of it."
1,DVD-R recordable media doesn't work for this product,"Unfortunately because it is not a professionally created DVD, it will not work for everyone. My ""copy"" does not work on any DVD player I have, my Xbox360, nor my computer. I wish they had put the ""This product is manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media. Amazon.com's standard return policy will apply."" at the top of the description instead of down at the bottom. My mistake, one which I will not make again.Go for professionally made DVDs, not copies like this."
2,"Disappointing, amateurish","I tried this out on the strength of Loud Like Nature. I wasn't completely sold on it, but thought that it was promising. Unfortunately, Avant Hard nowhere near as good, and it's hard to believe it is by the same group.It sounds like the work of someone who has just aquired a synthesiser, and is making the amateurish mistake of piling all sorts of ""cool"" effects on top on each other, and hoping that the resulting mess will stand up as art.There is simply no conception behind the pieces, which come over as just mishmashes of effects. Worse still, many are with larded over with irrelevant push-button sounds. It sounds like someone was playing an arcade game in the next room, and it somehow ended up in the mix.Buckminister Fuller is probably the most satisfying track, but Ann's Eveready Equestrian is really terrible, with some of the worst keyboards I've ever heard.Clearly, the album has its fans, but I'm sad to say I'm not among them."
4,One of Bushman's Best,"Definitely would highly recommend this album. It's one of those albums that you can play all the way through without skipping tracks. Some of the many highlights are ""Fire Bun a Weak Heart"", ""Total Commitment"" ""Hard Time"" and ""Terrible Inna Gideon"". Very thoughtful lyrics and the beats will have you skanking all the way through."
4,this sounds like Luciano,I swear this sounds just like Luciano who also calls himselp Jah's messenger.
4,Best Movie At HorrorFest!,"Very good movie...out of all the J-Horror I've seen this is one of the easiest to follow...I hear people tell me all the time that they get confused watching J-Horror...this ones not going to confuse you. It was creepy too...and well done. There was a creepy atmosphere through the whole movie and the end was really good even though I had it figured out before it was over. Probably the best out of all the horrorfest movies...of course that wouldn't be to hard considering most of the other ones sucked. It is subtitled so make sure you're willing to read before you buy it...but it will give you a scare. I actually would give it 4 1/2 stars because there were parts of the movie that were a little boring and some of it does move a little slow....but its really worth a watch, especially if you're into J-Horror."
3,Reincarnation,"I'm not a huge fan of J-Horror, just so you know when going into this review. I probably liked this movie least out of the entire Horrorfest, but it wasn't bad, I just found it to be an hour of boredom before things finally picked up (a common problem I see in J-Horror). And then the pick up in pace and visuals was so great it almost made up for the entire first hour! So to be honest, I had a hard time sitting through this until the payoff came, and even though the last bit of the movie was outstanding, it's still slightly below average."
2,Not quite what I had hoped for,"I remember seeing previews for these movies when they were being shown at movie theaters and they looked pretty good. I know they wouldn't be the best quality films, but I had seen one on TV and it was decent, so I didn't expect a problem from buying these 7.First of all, I was bummed that they didn't give you all 8. Why did you have to leave out that last movie? Was it really that much of a problem? That issue aside, these were mostly pretty lame movies. The story lines were interesting, but most of the actors ruined it. I can deal with cheesy low budget effects, but if you have that AND poor acting then there's no hope.I didn't find a single one of these films ""To Die For"". Not even a single moment of any of them was scary. Maybe next time they'll have higher budgets."
1,Sucked,"I can't begin to explain how completely unscary, non-gory, and boring these movies are. I love almost all horror fimls, especially the corny older ones but these movies were on a whole new level. While some(but few) may have had a decent plot, they lacked anything even remotely scary. The blood and gore was almost non existent. These were honestly the worst movies that I've ever seen. I think that the directors had a contest to see who could make the worst movie on the lowest budget. I watched them one after another praying that they would get better but they actually got worse. I wouldn't watch them again if they were free. I've watched films shot with a home video camera that were better. LONG AND DRAWN OUT, NOT SCARY, NOT GORY AT ALL!!! They should have called it crapfest."
2,was disapointed,"I was very excited to see this one. It looked really scary in the previews, but when I watched it I thought it was confusing at times. There are some scary parts in the movie but it is one that I would not watch again."
2,Do these japanese horror movies all have the same writer?,"Why is every single Japanese horror film exactly the same. They all have the same premise and it's starting to get really old. This was another dull horror fest film. It had a few creepy moments, but definately not enough to make it worth buying. I have seen just about every horror fest film and have been let down everytime. Don't bother with this one either."
1,Cure for insomnia,"I really don't know how this film got any positive reviews. There's nothing positive to write about it. It is very confusing, and hard to follow. Acting is very fake, and has next to no scares. This movie should be part of the BORE-FEST, and not the HORRORFEST"
3,The AFTER DARK horrorfest,"When the After dark horrorfest came to my city, I was hyper, hyper excited, and really, I was not too much disappointed by the result.The only ones I missed were Hood of Horrors and The Tripper (not in this package anyway).I agree that these movies were originally over-hyped as ""too graphic"" or whatever.While by and large these are indie horror movies, they were a departure from all the hollywood horror I see, and I personally thought there was a wide enough range to make the festival appealing.Each one is totally different, which is a plus.My favorites were Reincarnation (japanese horror), Penny Dreadful, Unrest.About the price, it's a bit too high, even if the packaging is cool. If they are individually on sale at 14.99, the box set should probably be a little cheaper. it would be nice if was maybe around 90 bucks."
4,Horrorfest 7 pack,"I enjoyed all these movies but I am not sure what all the hub-bub was about. They do not seem to me to be any scarier than any of the horror out there now.I purchased these because I thought they were done well with some serious BOO factor. I will admit that I rented them before actually buying them.Having seen so many horror movies in my time I found these refreshing. I was a little disappointed that the newest one I've seen, ""The Abandoned"" was not part of the seven.If you love horror you will enjoy these.KD"
2,Reincarnation,"I'd seen Shimizu's ""The grudge"" and so my expectations were pretty high on this supernatural horror film.It's nowhere near the scariness or originality of the grudge but that bein said, it's not too horrible as far as japanese horror flicks goes these days. The trailer was actually a lot scarier than the actual movie.The special FX are probably better than other stuff I've seen recently in b-type movies.Bottom line, I was expecting much more out of this."
5,Can't wait for the next 8 in 2007,"Great set, great horror films, I cannot wait for the next 8 in 2007. Keep making these and keep making them extreme!"
1,CHUCKY GOES EAST .......,"Dreadful mix of the ""Chucky"" series meets ""The Shining"" - this one becomes so confused at the end you're not sure which is which : ""If the movie within the movie and the present plus the past are one?????Confused? Bet your Bippy! Now find that in your Funk and Wagnalls ....."
3,"WAS REAL GOOD BUT, IS THE BIG BUT!!!","I heard this movie and ""the greavedancers"" is the best of the dark fest serial..Ya had lots creepy parts and liked the scrip. But this movie have a lots dialog, Most of times my eyes was on the subtitle, and could't see the movie, looks like was reading the movie insted watching it !!,Such I hate that! I had to rewind the scenes and watch it ,Because was reading the subtitle and so and so on ,Till done watching this flick. Liked the movie ,But was pain in the A** watching it throw!!, From now I never going to watch any movies with subtitle, just B.S and wasting time. if I want to read, I just read a book instead & more enjoyable . Anyway had a lots creepy intense parts.. was good!! Worth to rent or buy, if subtitle dont bother u! B"
5,We'll Stay Together Forever,I don't really like subtitled movies but this one was really good. i was so into it that i didn't care about the subtitles. this movie was pretty creepy espicialy the walking doll. i would say that i would put this movie in my top 20 scariest movies list.i thought that the director did a awesome job getting you confused on where the characters were. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do.
4,"good rap/rock band, but not sellout","its good to know that you can have a rap/rock band that isnt sellout like limp bizkit etc. i wouldnt have rated this CD so high if it werent for (hed)'s ""broke"" and some other songs i've heard. hed is awesome. as for this CD....id go with it if you were a somewhat big fan but not if you just want to try them out. ""serpent boy"", ""firsty"", ""tired of sleep"" and ""ken 2012"" have to be the best tracks."
5,leading the G-PUNK era,"hed (planetary evolution) is simply amazing.mcud delivers the goods by the plenty,and yes it does make fred look like a pud.hed just cant be touched with phat rhymes and phat beats and all the hard parts to match and bring it together.they also put on a really tight live show so catch them at the tattoo the earth tour if ya can and then wait till aug.22 for the new cd which is pretty smooth as well-later"
5,THis cd is the best,"i can honestly say this cd is defiantly my favorite cd, every song is aweosme... if u like bands like incubus, soulfy, LB or korn youll defianlty be into this group... its defiantly worth the money , buy it"
5,The the G-Punk invasion begin!!!,"(hed)p.e knows how to grab your attention and rip it to shreds! They mix a killer blend of hip hop, metal, and punk that'll blow your mind!!! With dj scratchin' and killer drum beats, thick heavy guitaring and vocalz to scream and rap your head off to, you're gauranteed to love this!!"
5,A wonderful rollercoaster ride of a CD,"The CD starts off with a nice bassline that relaxes the listener, the catapults him to his feet. This CD is wonderfully eclectic, and ranges from Hardcore(Ground), to R&B (T.O.S.), and everything in between. A must-have for hardcore/rapcore listeners!"
5,The best CD in the World..................,"This is Clearly the best cd ever made by any band or individual in the world. it fuses elements of reggae, funk and jazz and throws them together in a bag of the best hardcore rap metal you'll ever hear. ..."
1,Close to horrible,"The only good song on this album is ""Tired Of Sleep"". Seriously how can you people give this album 5 stars..... Its one of the most boring cd's ive ever heard. Save your money and if you must buy a Hed(PE) album, then get ""Broke""."
5,The Best CD. Period.. (hEd)p.e. Is the Best ever.,If you are into Urban tunes and Love Metal check out (hEd)p.e. They have there own Genre of music called G-Punk. They are the orginators of this type of music.
5,(HED)pe's CD is dope. Flat out.,"ok you can label (HED) any way you want but they break out from it. They are anything from hiphop, punk, some techno, metal, reggae, everything. its some crazy stuff going on. (HED) is always in my CD player, and when im pulling bongers, YOU KNOW (hed) is pumping out my speakers. This CD is flat out dope, Buy it."
5,Classic definition of what rap rock should be,"To put some context on my view on the band, probably necessary as my view is reasonably strong, half of their records are great and a couple didn't click with me at all.But this one is perhaps one of the greatest records I have ever heard. Me being a fan of early rap like Public Enemy, and modern hard rock like Nine Inch Nails, Sevendust, Living Colour, rock rap should generally grab me. And it wasn't until I heard this mob that I was taken at all.It's intelligently written, played and sung with intense passion, the guitar riffs and general playing has all the energy and agression of someone like Sevendust - just powerful.Hard to explain it as there is not really a lot to compare it too - a couple of Bionic Jive tracks maybe, but nothing like this.Tracks which describe the record well are ""Hill"", ""IFO"" - this is a masterpiece"", ""Serpent Boy"", ""Ground""brilliant"
5,No one else is close to (hed) pe,I like this album because not many bands have the same style of music as (hed)pe. This album represents one of the best rap/metal mixtures I have heard. Some of the songs on this album have that real heavy sound to it and others have more of a rap feel to them. Two of the best songs on this album are Firsty and Circus. They both represent the heavy sound that(hed)pe can obtain. No one else is close to the sound (hed)pe obtained in this album.
3,"Trendy, Very Trendy","Interesting, but far from original. (Hed)Pe sounds very much alike all those ""rap metal"" bands out there. The same screeching vocals, detuned noise guitars and funky beats are undeniably present; the reggae singing is a nice addition, though."
4,An Interesting Medly of Musical Tastes.,"I bought this CD without hearing them b/c I was buying my Incubus CD, and at first I didn't like it. I'm usually into more lite stuff like 311, but after listening to it for a while, it grew on me, and now I like it a lot. They have a nice metal rapcore sound without sounding too much like Korn."
5,hed pe,"all of (hed)p.e. music is amazing ... if you are a fan of sytem of a down, incubus, coal chamber etc. you will love anything by (hed)p.e."
5,(hed) pe,planetary evolution is what the pe stands for. I'm not exactly sure what they are aiming our planet to evolve towards but the music is dope and if you never heard (hed) then check em out. Ever been to a CD store and saw a CD you heard about but your not sure if ya wanna buy it? Well this is a CD you can buy without even listening to it but if ya get the chance to check out (hed) do it they put on a good show and have a great CD
2,what is up,hed pe is so cool but the music just doesn't have enough cords you guys would be the best with tom morello of rage.
1,RATM is way better!,rage against the machine can stomp this band anyday. hed pe ain't got nothing for good talent.
5,Fabulous Pilates Workout!,I brought this DVD as I had purchased Tracey's Booty Barre which I really enjoyed. This is a great well cued Pilates workout that really worked my core with precise Pilates movements. I really enjoyed working the ball as it added variety and challenge. I liked that I could pick a few section as an addition to my other workouts for cross-training. A total abs and lower body workout!!!
3,A little disappointed,"I tried this DVD this morning and I am a tad confused. The DVD menu did not have the AB section or the Total Body section. I purchased the DVD as it said it was 60 minutes. The DVD I used with the segments for selection is only 40 minutes. Something is not right here.On the leg section, Tracey leaves out a hamstring segment on one side. I hate when instructors do this (or is it bad editing).I do love the addition of the ball though."
4,Playground?,"I love that the description says you need a small playground to do this work out. I think they meant playground BALL, but too funny."
3,Good book,"I never realized that God would have a prescription for depression until I read this book. But He does! Through the author's work, we have another source of hope."
4,good cd,"Personally i didnt think this was a classic like many other people said, but it was good, i think that if joe had the money and technology that he has today to spend on sound quality he couldve made this better. and joe's topic range can at times not be the best. the best song without a doubt is no one else compares, this song blew me away, classic song no doubt, let anyone listen to this song that at least has a heart and they'll love this song, but the rest of the cd is good but not a classic, i think that if joe put the best songs from each of his albums on one album it would be the best r&b cd ever."
4,Joe Love,"Smooth rhythms and the sweet melodies make this CD one of the greatest. Lyrics from ""No One Comes Close"" is awesome, touching many hearts. I know music, and I say his songs are great."
5,BREATH TAKING!!!,This boy can blow!!!! This C.D. is great for love making and rebuilding relationships.
5,I Fell in Love with Joe after I listened to his CD.,"If I could give this CD 10 stars I would. Joe has always been a great vocalist proving himself on his first CD, but ""All that I Am"" is by far the best R&B CD I've purchased in a long while. I love the CD so much, I purchased 3 (1 for home, 1 for the car and 1 for my husband). Joe has what it takes to make it to the top without being raunchy and crude. He gets my vote anyday!!!!"
5,I think it's a pimp cd,I think Joe's cd all that I am is the best cd I have I'm a songwriter and I think his songs sound alot like mine. he's my favorite artist. If anyone is interested I'm a 12 yer old song writer and I'm tryng to get started in a music career. I've wrote 8 songs and I also sing pretty good so please give me a chance thakyou. peaceout
4,"Actually, It's Just the Tip of the Iceberg of Who Joe Is","This second CD of his really helped him boost his career and helped to uplift the spirit of the 1990s. Songs like ""All the Things Your Man Won't Do"", ""No One Else Comes Close"", and ""The Love Scene"" help to bring out his depth in R&B as a singer and performer. Personally, the song ""Good Girls"" describes how I felt for most of my life, including the period that the album came out, so as a whole, I give it 4 stars, and it's definitely worth the time and money spent."
3,All That I AM-Big Will's Review,"So this is the second album from Joe. Although it has a few songs I like a lot it only gains three stars. Don't get me wrong, the songs I like I really like. It should be said that the stars come from my iTunes rating, and are subject to change as I develop new tastes. Considering though I have had this album since it first came out there probably wont be too many changes. Here is how I rated each song:1. All The Things (Your Man Won't Do)-4 Stars2. The Love Scene-5 Stars3. Don't Wanna Be A Player-5 Stars4. Good Girls-5 Stars5. How Soon-3 Stars6. Sanctified Girl (Can't Fight This Feeling)-2 Stars7. All That I Am-3 Stars8. No One Else Comes Close-4 Stars9. Come Around-2 Stars10. U Shoulda Told Me (U Had A Man)-2 Stars11. Love Don't Make No Sense-2 Stars12. No One Else Comes Close (Unplugged)-4 StarsLike I said really the only songs that have potential to move up right now are Tracks 1, 8, and 12. I like track 1 but when it came out it got played to death."
1,WARNING: 2 Books with the SAME NAME,"When I ordered Massage for Dummies I had no idea I was ordering a miniature edition (2.5"" x 3""). It's worthless. DO NOT order the hardback mini-book with the ISBN number 048693408390 unless you want a little gag gift. BE CAREFUL SO YOU ORDER THE BOOK YOU REALLY WANT."
1,PLEASE READ BEFORE BUYING!!,This book is very small!! So small that I almost cant read the print. This would be a good gage gift or if you want to take this book on a date and not have the other person know it's in your back pocket or purse. Due to the size this book has only 4 chapters but is 128 pages long. This book isn't very helpful at all due to the fact you can barely read or see it. I thought I was getting a great deal for this book but I found I have great disappointment instead.
3,Good for beginners,"I bought this book to learn about the art of giving a massage...my wife pestered me to no end to give her a massage, and would complain about it when I DID attempt to do it.This book is useful. It covers the basics of kneading, gliding, etc. For someone with no knowledge about massages it is a good starter. And, it got my wife off my case (for the time being).I did not find the whole part about ""How to receive a massage"" to be useful...anyone can receive a massage and enjoy it, so why write a whole chapter on the subject?-R294"
2,"Light on content, full of filler","This book covers the basics, but it will make you work to unearth the very rudimentary tips buried underneath dull asides, lame jokes, and torrents of banal information.I would be more willing to tolerate the author's lame sense of humour if he didn't peddle so much nonsense - the amount of pernicious anti-scientific twaddle in this book makes the author look like a gullible fool (pimping reflexology, acupressure and other inane practices), which makes it so much more difficult to esteem him as an expert.I read this book out of duty to my girlfriend, who got it for me, but it was painful to get through the first few chapters, which could have been replaced with bullet-points in their entirety."
4,small but mighty massage book,"When I received this book I was a little surprised by its size but after reading its contents, I decided it was small but mighty. The book is about 3in by 3in but packed with good info about how to give a good massage."
1,Disappointed - heavy chemical smell,The Backside Anti-pil Fleece Sleeping Bag has a very strong acrid chemical smell that remains even after five consecutive washings. Had to return two of these colorful but not so soft fleece bags. Poor stitching on one of the units.
3,Should be in the bookshlef of your work place,"This guide book, describing revised Bethesda system, sould be beside pathologists and cytopathologists. Nice color photos are quite informative."
3,The Bethesda System for Reporting Cervical Cytology,"I found the cheapest current edition of this text. Overall the book was in good condition but appeared alittle used. There were some scuffs, stains and a large fold on the back cover. I am guessing that is why this book was discounted. Just wish it would have been mentioned."
2,Disappointed With Amelia,"I have read all Amelia Peabody books and would give any other an enthusiastic five stars! But this one just lost its charm. At LEAST 50% of the book was boring an uneventful. The book was missing the usual wit and humor behind almost every line out of Amelia's mouth. David and Ramses were trying to be responsible parents and didn't sneak out on adventures. There was not a lot of disguising (on the part of the Emerson's, that is.) If you're a huge fan, like myself, I'd read it (but it isn't worth buying, get it from a library) just to meet Ramses' and Nefrets twins, Davy and Charla, and learn Sethos's real name!Otherwise, if you want to read fabulous, funny, page-turning books, start with The Crocodil on the Sandbank and work your way up to The Golden One!"
4,Not one of her best,"I was so excited that a new book was coming out, I couldn't wait. Well after finshing the book it was not the wait. I was excited to read that the family has come back together, but the family is getting way to large. There are just to many people involved. I thought that all of the loose ends were tied up in the last two books Peters surprised me by adding some new twisted to the beloved Emerson family. Overall it was good but not one of her best."
2,Slow Paced,"Not one of her better Peabody books, the first 3rd of this book is very slow paced.It is a great series, and she's a strong writer, but you have to be a dedicated fan to slog through the beginning of the book.If you are new to reading this series, I would recommend starting off with one of her earlier books. There are a lot of characters to follow, and a long history to each character, so it's not an easy series to jump into part way through.Having said that, once you start to read the series, you'll enjoy the family and their travels and tales.It's more of a beach read, than any type of serious intellectual pursuit, but you'll still pick up some interesting trivia along the way."
4,Always excellent,Elizabeth Peters has done it again. Her Mrs. Amelia P. Emerson is the heroine that comes as a fresh wind in the violent profession of sleuths in litterature today.
1,I am so sorry,"I am so sorry I read this book under the illusion it was a mystery type of book. The author has been writing on the edge of fictional biography/mystery, and this time she crossed the line. I got bewildered when the ""plot"" never turned up, the bad guys were just so unimportant that the twins linguistic skills just overrode their appearance on the scene and Peabody's maternal instincts just couldn't be bothered with evil doers. The book is probably fine for those who bought the author's work for reading about the sentimental family interrelations but for those who expected something more exciting it is a dissapointment. I feel as if I was sold this book on false pretenses."
5,The sky's the limit,"In Ann Perry's book, young people from three very different backgrounds meet, interact, and then move on to find a purpose for themselves. Their families, their loved ones, and their friends are also involved in these relationships and in either hindering or helping in their growth and maturity. As always Ann moves us into the internal conflicts and questions of people in tough situations."
5,Perry triumphs again!!!,"Anne Perry is a wonderful writer. Her Monk and Pitt series paint pictures of the late 1800's.Now in this new series, we meet and come to care for the Reavley family, circa WWI, whose parents were murdered due to discovering a treaty that would stop the war, but in essence makes everyone in the world members of 2 world powers, instead of freedom.Perry takes us to the trenches in Ypres, where sister Judith is a volunteer driver, and brother Joseph is a chaplain.Her descriptions on the grim reality of war. including gas attacks, and horrid conditions in the trenches transports you there...As effective as reading Wilfred Owens' poetry.This is a series to add your list.Perry continues to be top in her game."
2,"Fascinating subject, terrible writing","I really wanted to learn more about Maeve Brennan, but we got stuck with every detail around her in this book, like we wanted to learn about this colorful carousel, but all we got were details of the circus!"
3,Hank deserves better!,"It is a good cd,don't get me wrong. Some great Hank songs and several good covers.But he deseves so much better than this.Trick Pony should not have done ""All My Rowdy Friends"" and Aaron Tippon should be ashamed of his cover of ""Family Tradition"".Travis Tritt should have been on the cd and Kid Rock should have been on here too. I do reccomend the cd to all the true Bocephus fans though."
3,"Hank Tribute is pretty good, but missing a few things. . .","This album is pretty good but it's not as good as I think Bocephus deserves. A true outlaw and a country rock pioneer Hank has influenced so many artists over the years, but few artists have the same sound and attitute that Hank does. Blake Shelton I think could have covered a better song than ""Young Country"". Montgomery Gentry did a fine job on covering ""Women I've never Had"" and Marshall Tucker and Lynyrd Skynyrd did good covers too. The best song I think is ""Outlaw Women"" by Tracy Lawrence, with a swampy feel to it, gave me goosebumps when I first heard it. What this album is missing is Travis Tritt covering a song.If Hank has influenced anyone in music today, it's him. He has done ""Lone Wolf"" ""Old Habits"" and ""Whiskey On Ice"" in concert and it could have been the best if he was put on the CD. Overall this album is average, but I would only reccomend it to Hank fans."
3,Hank Deserves Better!!!,"Don't get me wrong,this is still a good cd.But only suggested to true Bocephus fans.Trick Pony should not of done ""All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight"" and Aarron Tippon should never have released his version of ""Family Tradition"".Travis Tritt along with Hank Jr. friend and fan Kid Rock are both missing on this album,and they really should be there.The cd is ok but only suggested for true Bocephus fans.Let's face it after all Hank Jr. has done for us he deserves better than this cd."
1,Trying to be as nice as I can!!,"I bought it, played it, and before I drove up my driveway it had been tossed out the window (seriously). Don't bother spending your hard earned dollars, this CD is not worth it (putting it mildly). Whoever thought of this project should have gotten fired. Come on, Trick Pony trying to sing ""All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight!"" The classic ""Family Tradition"" was completely butchered, by God, if you didn't know, it's a drinking song. The only ones that did a commendable job were Tracy Lawrence and Alan Jackson. I'm truely am very really sorry Hank!! Since no one said it, I'll say it for you, ""WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE THAT BOY ALONE AND LET HIM SING HIS SONGS."""
5,chapter 10...Father Yod and the Source brotherhood,"Steve Allen was a good friend of Jim Baker long before he opened the SOURCE RESTAURANT and formed the Source communal family. Brian, Steve son had joined the Love Israel Family and he also spent time with the Source Family in L.A.Steve use to come to the Source and Eat and reconnect with Jim who now was Father Yod...he dedicated a whole chapter to Jim Baker/ Father Yod and the Source in chapter 10 of the book and commented how he looked like a Michael Angelo painting of what God would look like :)This book is a good read and is honest and presents all sides yet was done in fairness.isis aquarianSource Brotherhood"
5,Fun-filled fiction,"The Finch family was in desparate straits. They had to find a house to rent in the town of Ashfield. Finally they were given the only available house, along with a warning: it had a very unusual furnace - a small volcano. This book describes the lengths that the family must go to in order to keep their ""furnace"" a secret to their neighbors. The climax comes when the volcano starts to grow larger! The author of this book has an unbelievable imagination. My brother and sisters and I have read this book many times. We thoroughly enjoy it."
4,Fast Paced,Classic film about one good idealistic person against the big Evil Firm. Mpves at a good clip and keeps the viewer interested.
3,Good movie..not great..,"Good on suspense and.story. Viewing experience was terrible though especially from a source that doea so much in the cloud. Kept buffering even though my connection was snappy everywhere else. If there was a place to rate that, I would use it."
4,Tom Cruise in his better years,The Firm is a book based on a John Grisham novel. It is a great movie and an even better book. This movie is accurate to the book and is a recommended watch for any Grisham fan.
4,I saw this twice.,"I read the book and then re-read the book. I saw the movie not once but twice. It is somewhat different from the book. I like Pollock a lot, his movies are so interesting to me that I could'nt wait for the movie to come out. The acting was well done only one flaw. Casting Tom Cruise in this otherwise well developed movie. Everyone else does a great job of acting here. To me though, Tom is miscasted. He seems to be out of place. His thinking is good and his intentions are what the character is suppose to be but He just did'nt click of what Sidney wanted the character to be and do. Sorry Cruise fans he is wasted as far as I am concerned. Gene Hackman, and as well as Ed Harris they did well. A great movie but could have been better without Cruise here."
4,"Overlong, but never less than engrossing","Cruise continues his graduation away from teenage girl type movies like ""Top Gun"" and ""Cocktail"" and puts in a superb performance in director Pollock's excellent , if overlong adaption of Grisham's book. Cruise plays a hot shot young lawyer who discovers that the wealthy Memphis Legal firm he works for represents a particularly sinister customer. He's given strong support from an all star cast, particularly from Tripplehorn and Hunter and a brilliant (as ever) Hackman. It goes on too long by at least 20 minutes, but is slick, engrossing and suspenceful, particular at the end. The softer ending that shys away from the tough stance of the book is slightly disappointing though."
4,Very Good,"The worst part of this movie was the casting of Tom Cruise's wife, the Nobody that played in Waterworld. She comes across as way too old for a brand new lawyer fresh out of school. Other than that, the movie had great suspense, a somewhat unbelievable ending, but good, clean entertainment."
1,Very Good - if you want to SLEEP,"This movie is absolutely boring. So, save the money and buy a better one"
2,not firm enough,"good points: gene hackman, some great cinematography, some fast-paced scenes, at points the female co-star cuts the mustardthe bad points (my revenge at having to sit through 2.5 long, annoying hours): tom cruise is often emotionally fake and shallow, the story isn't always logical (so don't watch it if you like to analyze stories too much), many of the characters and scenes were WOODEN!, overall mostly just junk food quality (and at times i got a hair in my burger!)why i kept watching it: gives insight into our culture and its ideals - the immature grandiose fantasy of being the genius, brilliant, athletic hero who stumps everyone and is more clever than the FBI and the mob [= the child is more clever than the abusive parents = unreality!]"
2,Boring Legal Mush,"There is one thing you can't call Author John Grisham, and the word is ""original."" Book after book, made into a legal ""thriller"" that is supposed to entertain us. Some of his stories were good, like ""The Client."" But this movie is not as great. It is way too long (2 and a half hours) and tends to drag on at the end. The story has a conflict, but no substance because it seems that the conflict in this story is an empty threat that never evloves to anything. Even though the characters go through heated emotions, it is hard to relate or care about them. Not Reccomended."
2,It was pathetic.,The movie was the biggest waste of time. It was so far off the book and there was no suspense in it. The novel was a thriller and the movie was just long and boring.
2,Could have been better,"The book, as always, was much better and more interesting. The worst part of this movie was the irritating piano music that underscores most or just about all of the scenes, very distracting. Did anyone else notice this?"
1,Terrible If You've Read The Book,"I LOVED the book. I was really amped to see the movie but after it was about ten minutes in, I knew I wasn't going to like it. Changed A LOT of the story and it was not enjoyable whatsoever. Not to mention that Abby was pretty fugly and a poor actress. I always knew Cruise was a weenie and this one just further advanced that opinion. Just go read the book, way better."
2,Read the Book First,"I have read every John Grisham book he has ever written and loved all of them. This movie moves so far from the book that it's like two different plots and sadly, looses a lot of the Grisham appeal. I though the actors did a good job, but after just reading the book a week before watching the move, it was hard not to keep making the comparisons. One simple example is that in the book Mitch get a new BMW when he signs with the firm and in the movie he gets a Mercedes. Simple, but why not stay true to the book? Did Mercedes pay more for the rights?"
4,Very good,"I like Tom Cruise in most of his movies, I thought this was one of his better ones. A young husband and his wife start out with a big Law Firm making major money only to find it is a very corrupt firm trying to take over every aspect of their lives, at work and in the home. I really liked his solution to the problem, not only did he get his brother out of prison, but he freed himself and his wife without giving up his whole life and career and had the FBI where he wanted them for a change instead of the other way around. And he kept all the evidence against the firms clients and them in the event he ever needed it, so boy did he have the hammer! He also got rid of two of the really bad guys. He and Abbie went on with their lives in a new place and in a new way."
1,Implausible Ending and Overacting Ruin Grisham Novel,"""The Firm"" stands out as a shining example of why one should read the novel before watching the movie made from it. I noted that some reviewers have criticized the music, which I always thought of as being out of place in this picture. The two biggest problems I have with the movie are Tom Cruise's ham-handed acting performance and an ending that strays from that in the novel and simply is too implausible. A previous customer reviewer commented that Cruise's character would have been killed by the mobsters, and I agree wholeheartedly with that assessment. If Cruise had been a little more restrained, and if the producers had followed Grisham's book more faithfully, I believe that it could have been a much better movie than the forgettable waste of time that it ended up being."
1,No Substance,"I was extremely disappointed, prior to seeing this movie I read the book. it has no way near the intensity of the book, neither is it true to the storyline, especially the ending. Do Yourself a favour, if you haven't seen the firm already, Don't see it, Don't waste your money, buy the book instead. unless you like watching paint dry, avoid at all costs."
2,NOT FOR ME,"I did not like this film. It did have drama and suspense, and Tom Cruise and Gene Hackman were good. Bribery, blackmail... always good premises for action pictures. But personal taste dictates that I just did not get into it. Jeanne Tripplehorn is one good reason not to like it. Sometimes she is very likeable (in the virtually unknown Til There Was You) but other times not so (Sliding Doors). Most people who see this will probably like it. What can I say?"
1,Simply Too Implausible,"Maybe its because I'm a lawyer and know what the ""real world"" is like (as opposed to the fantasy portrayed in this movie), maybe its because I'm not much of Tom Cruise fan (the only movies he's done that I can stand are Rainman and The Color of Money, and that's because of his co-stars in those films, not him), but for whatever reason I've got to rank this film as one of the worst I've ever seen.The ending of the movie (which is different from the ending in the book) is so totally implausible that it ruined whatever entertaining aspects the film possessed. Cruise's performance is even more woodeen here than in last summer's disasterous Eyes Wide Shut. And, except for Gene Hackman, the casting is completely misplaced --- I mean, really, Wilford Brimley as a Mafia enforcer ???? Gimme a break.If you're looking for a legal thriller, go get The Rainmaker instead, or watch an episode of The Practice."
3,Different than the book,"I have read the book and I was interested in the motion picture, but when I saw it I felt disappointed because it is different to the book, and in my opinion, the history in the book is much better than the history shown in the movie after the changes they made."
4,Intense with a good ending,"Intense but enjoyable, I liked that there was minimal violence on screen with nominal profanity which is hard to find these days. Something both men and women could enjoy."
5,A suspenseful legal practice story,"""The Firm"" is a thriller genre film that leaves the viewer continually on the edge of their seat. The narrative is well presented with changing dynamics that cause young Lawyer Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise) to face precarious situations, and he has to use clever wits and scrupulous strategy to stay ahead of extortive coercion. Cruise provides a lively and compelling performance.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"
2,Betrayal of the Book,"The acting was good, and the movie was fine as a whole; however, the book made a point. The movie simply bashed lawyers. That's not tough sport."
2,What was Sidney Pollack doing in directing this?,"The first sign that this movie was going to be well below the book's quality level was the jazzy piano music from the first step. The early scene was a lot weaker than the book's. It continued from there. This did not need to be an R-rated movie, but some Hollywood idiot thought better.There had been several actresses who received both best actress and best supporting actress (different roles) the same year, and the norm was typified by Jessica Lange in '82, when she lost the best actress but won the best supporting actress. The next actress in that position (Sigourney Weaver, for ""Gorillas In The Mist"" and ""Working Girl"" failed to win either. Holly Hunter was nominated in '93 for ""The Piano"" as best actress, which she won, and this movie for best supporting actress, which I did not believe she was as worthy of.I like Wilford Brumley, but I cannot think of anything in this movie that is worth recommending to you."
1,Disappointing letdown for a very great novel,"Why would anyone want to take a really great novel, ""adapt"" it, and come up with a bomb? Ask the script-writers of the Firm. The movie is illogical and preposterous. The taut extremely clever thriller book has become a soap opera combined with a routine chase movie."
1,What a load of rubbish,"Oh please! what a pathetically long boring movie. Yes, I have read the *book* and Cruise, Trippelhorn, Hunter and Hackman are all flat as a pancake. The firm's lawyers look like George W with a Marx moustache. The firm itself doesn't even look menacing, and Tarrance looks like an egg. Ray McDeere looks impossibly sleazy, and what on earth happened to the Locke of Bendini, Lambert & Locke. And what a ridiculous ending - mail fraud. The whole point of this story is Mitch's conscience, as the newbie, his fresh law school ethics. Instead he helps the FBI indict BL&L for f***ing MAIL FRAUD. Good grief."
1,The Firm,Great movie but CD not perfoming in the last few scenes. It gets stuck or restarts itself. Very frustrating and more frustrating to have to return new CD.
1,Typical Over-Rated Cruise film,as usual Tom Cruise over acts.the only thing that saves this film is Paul Sourvino&Gene Hackman.John Grisham wrote a far better book.sadly you get the Hollywood version.all Gloss and not much Substance.
5,a masterpiece,This is the first book I ever read that created a symphony in my mind as I read. The images are deep and full. The characters are rich and tormented. It is magical.
1,Not new,Book was not new as advertised. It had been reglued with pages being impacted and some are unreadable due to the regluing/rebinding.
3,"Very basic, generic information","This is not a bad book - if you have had your head in the financial sand for the last 10 years.If, however, you regularly read the business section then it is an overly simplified quick read that will benefit you nothing, except to show you how much you already knew. Each chapter of the book is basically a well written magazine article, giving general tips for life such as ""get a credit card with the lowest interest rate"" or ""pay off your mortgage early to save interest costs"" or ""don't over insure yourself"".This would be a good book to give someone just graduating high school, but for anyone with the slightest financial sophistication, it is a waste of time."
1,"WARNING, no color photographs in this art reference book...","I ordered this book August 28, 1998, it arrived well over four years later (publishing date delayed). Well, the publishing date should have been delayed even more.There is not a single color photo in this book, a homely object without even a colored dust jacket to adorn it. It is a disappointment and incredible irritation to receive an art reference book without colored photographs.The grainy black and white photos that illustrate (without color) harpsichord decoration are poor quality reproductions and many exist in clearer form (and color) in other reference books.So few books are published on the harpsichord topic, it was a tragedy for the publisher to waste this opportunity. Anyone interested in this topic would have gladly paid the premium for color photographs."
3,good stories but pictures can be a little scary,"This is a great collection of stories, but when I was a little girl I was very scared of some of the drawings of the villians. So, the illustrations are excellent but a very young child might find them a little...intense. Nevertheless, I still liked the book and read it often."
4,Daughters Kindergarten Language Arts,This book is one of the cornerstones of my daughter's online based Kindergarten Language Arts course. She is now 6 years old and has had the book since last February.I think the vocabulary in this book is more suited for 2nd graders and my daughter gets frustrated with how drawn out some of the stories are. The illustrations can be a bit much but so far she has not complained about them. She's not the type to get scared easily but I can see how some kids might get a little frightened.It is a very nice book from an adult perspective. I am purchasing a copy to keep for when she has to turn this school book in. I have noticed as she has gotten older she is getting better with this book. At first she used to try to hide the book and would moan and complain the entire time I read it. To say she hated it would be an understatement!
5,A perfect collection of Fairy Tales,This book is absolutely wonderful. My childen love it and it is exactly what is being taught in the schools.
3,This is abridged!,"I was very annoyed to discover that this audiobook is an abridged version of the book. Many of the most delightful parts--the train ride with the smelly cheeses, Uncle Podger hanging a picture, Harris singing comic songs--have been removed in order to give the audiobook a more stream-lined feel. I don't mind that Jerome K. Jerome's ponderous philosophical interludes have been trimmed, but I would have liked to have known that I wasn't getting the whole book when I bought this CD!"
4,Funny almost all the way through,"This is one of the funniest books I've ever read. So why only 4 stars? Because it's not consistantly funny. The problem seems to be that Jerome started to write a travel story, with some serious thought on history and life, and added a few humorous bits as he went along. His editor got him to tone down the history and emphasize the humor, but we, the readers, are still stuck with some dreary Victorian romantic musings.But then there are the funny bits. And there are a lot of them. I'd say 80% of this book is funny, and a good 10% is hysterically funny. Well worth the dull patches.WARNING: Do not read this in a public place. You WILL embarrass yourself by laughing out loud. The pages on cheese are especially deadly. I still giggle uncontrolably each time I re-read them."
4,have read his other work - a wonder,"Perhaps I break the rules, having not read the book, but I know the praise all too well. I found Jerome's ""Idle Thoughts of and Idle Fellow"" in a box of discarded booxs. It is the finest thing I ever read. Why isn't this old Englishman a household word - that's what I want to know . . ."
2,Not that Great!,It was suggested that I read this before a tour of England and Scotland. Can't say i enjoyed it as I guess I don't get British humor.
3,Fun Book,"It''s a fun book, and many times even funny, but not on a high level. There are many places that just ramble on for no apparent purpose or relevancy."
3,Heard a lot about this book,"So many people on my online reading site loved this book. I am not sure if I had my expectations too high, but I couldn't really get into the book."
1,Three Men in a Boat,"The book Three Men in a boat is hilarious, a comic jewel.But,warning,do NOT buy the edition with a photo of only the boat (prow I think)It is an ugly edition, not for adult readers."
5,Classic comedy at its best,"Trully a funny book full of humourous ramblings and a boat on the thames makes a great setting the sequence with the can opener or lack of is an absolute jem. This is in the class of Lazonby Trips the Light Fantastic and other comedy classics, if you love humour read it."
4,Good humor,"The most amazing and humorous stories I've ever read. Characters seems to be minor compared to situations there are in and what they do. Whatever happens in the story is depicted in a funniest words and phrases. Sometimes characters are presented as naive, childish, moronic, although not feeling such."
1,Kindle Edition unacceptable,This Kindle version is not acceptable. There are extra words and missing words. It was free but don't bother with it. I bought a copy at a used book store to read the book.
1,Boring boring boring book,I did not enjoy this at all. Very boring book..also sexist.. The jokes were not really funny. Perhaps it will be better liked by single men.
5,Fabulous Book,"When I began to read Three Men in a Boat, I didn't realize it was not a contemporary book. Even though it was written in the nineteenth century, it felt very modern. The dry humor reminded me of Monty Python, and I laughed out loud throughout. I came away feeling like I had just taken a trip up the Thames, and I learned some history along the way. A funny, fast, terrific read."
4,A comedic classic,"I had put off reading this book for many years, and finally got to it.The writing in this novel is simply superb. Jerome possesses a comic timing that most authors don't have and can simply never hope to have. He is able to weave in a history of the River Thames in with the bumblings of the three main characters and their dog, without hurting either major premise of the book.The main reason to read this is because it will make you laugh. If it doesn't, you are not understanding it correctly."
4,Who are these guys and can they come for dinner?,"At first I thought: Oh no, this is going to be one of those 19th century books that everybody says is great...like all the ones from English in college...that you hated to read because they were like slogging through mud.But it wasn't. I actually ended up laughing so hard while reading in public that my teenaged kids moved away from me so as not to be humiliated.This is a very, very fast read, and worth every word. I wish I could find another like it!"
3,Abridged!,I feel like I should point out: The audio version here is in fact abridged. So don't pay more for this one because you think it's the unabridged reading. CSA Word only produced the abridged reading.
1,Boring,Everyone is different which is which i found this book boring and not humourous at all. I will not be back buying from this author
2,"Pieces of humor, too well-hidden","If you can page-through the many long-winded remarks about nature, etc., you still find a few nuggets of wit that are still pertinent today. Unfortunately, these witisisms are hardly laugh out loud and most of the diaglogue is incredibly dated. For $1, you can experience excellent writing and some interesting comments on human nature, but I was left feeling cheated. There are plenty of modern writers commenting on human nature, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
2,"Order was somewhat filled, and late.","Ordered four copies of this book, from three different Amazon vendors, on 12/7/11. Shortly after that, I received one copy. Then nothing until 1/9/12, when two more arrived. The fourth has yet to appear.As I had planned for all four to be Christmas gifts, I'm extremely disappointed."
3,Victorian sedative,This book is a very slow-paced story of a rowboat journey on the river. Many humorous incidents. Mark Twain's much better.
1,Not for me,"I had rave reviews from a friend for this book, but for me I could not even get through it...."
2,Three Men in a Boat,"Sorry, not my type of book at all. This book was only the 2nd book I had downloaded on my new Kindle and it was free."
3,"Humorous, but half way through...","I enjoyed the beginning of the book. It was chock full of quick-witted banter that made me chuckle. But when I reached the middle of the book, a question came to mind: Why am I bothering? The book is not funny. It's mildly humorous. There's nothing about the story or the language that is particularly uplifting or edifying. I decided to stop reading and move on to something more beneficial to me."
5,Absolutely delightful,"I laughed out loud through the whole first chapter, and when I was done, I thought to myself, even if I don't read another page of this book, it was worth it, just to have read this one chapter. To my delight the rest of the book was just as good, at least! This is one of the best books I've ever read. Buy it. Read it. And have one of the best experiences of your life!"
4,Hilarious!,"The author in his inimitable style has managed to make me laugh even in the technology crazed days of today ( as opposed to gliding down the Thames in a simple boat). It is truly one of the most entertaining comic capers of our times (and presumably those times as well !).To be read when depressed, lonely, sad, happy, cheerful, angry, scared, horrified, feverish... just about any mood ( even when you're moodless!)"
3,A Trip up the Thames River with 3 characters,"This was a delightful old-fashioned book written in 1889. It is funny, dumb, ridiculous,and special. It made me want to take a trip down the Thames River in England, (so I wouldn't have to work so hard pulling the boat or rowing up-stream). I have the first printing and it has delightful sketches of the various problems the men and dog endure. There are elaborate descriptions of the various stopping points. So your imagination enlarges the pleasure."
2,Didn't age well,"Jerome K. Jerome might have been a riot 100 years ago but this book will provoke only a rare smirk. The best bits belong to the dog who only seems to appear at the end of every third or fourth chapter to drop a one-liner. Other than that, it is aged, slow moving slapstick with some oddly out-of-place moments of reflection.How anyone can call this a laugh riot boggles my mind."
4,Light and funny classic,"In this classic novel of humor, three men (to say nothing of the dog) decide to cure their hypochondriac ailments by getting fresh air and exercise. They decide to travel down the Thames in a boat. The narrator jumps back and forth between humorous description of their preparations/trip and silly reminiscences of loosely connected incidents about the characters. This is the type of book where, at the end, you're not sure if there was any story in there at all, but you certainly enjoyed the trip regardless. It was a good-natured, happy sort of humor. This is a short book, and certainly worth reading if you like the classics."
4,Still Funny After All These Years,"This is a funny rambling story told by a Victorian era ranconteur that still holds up well for the most part. The Boat trip up the Thames is the setting that allows Jerome Jerome to reflect on all sorts of things in the style of a Mark Twain and his wit is highly entertaining. Don't expect to be bowled over with laughter though, his material is a bit dated.Nevertheless, this is a funny.witty and at times enlightening look at a period in England that is no longer."
5,Sustained comic yarn,"Having grown up in a storytelling culture, I recognized the tones of this book immediately. This is a beautifully crystalline, razor-sharp example of the sustained comic yarn, of the sort told late of an evening over drinks for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. This book was recommended to me by a friend, and now I'm recommending it to everyone I know who has an appreciation for a straight up, running humorous anecdote. If you have that kind of funny bone this book will gratify it, particularly if you like your tall tale told in an distictly British accent."
4,Hilarious,"I read this after reading Connie Willis' To Say Nothing of the Dog (which is sort of a remake of Jerome's book). I was worried that, after Willis' book which is fantastic, I would be disappointed by Three Men and a Boat but no such thing!Jerome is hilarious and his characters are wonderfully unselfconscious English eccentrics. Their journey down the river (taken b/c of poor health-all the characters are hypochondriacs) had me laughing non-stop.I can't understand why this book is not better known. If you are an Anglophile, a history buff or, even just a lover of eccentric characters, this is the book for you. Buy it, rent a boat and float down the nearest river reading this! You won't regret it!"
5,Stop Whining,"Is everyone that impossible to please? First Bruce puts out what is easily the best box set of the 90's with plenty of great stuff. The insatiable lot of you whined that it wasn't enough and cried specifically that The Fever and The Promise weren't on it. So Bruce finds a recording of The Fever for you and goes back and re-records The Promise for you. He puts them on a small sampling of the box and throws in another unreleased song for you too. You waited 20+ years for these and now you're crying about 12 lousy bucks? How much money did you cheat Bruce out of buying bootlegs?Thanks Bruce, for responding to the fans and critics and giving us these songs, too."
2,Generally mediocre. I was struggling between 2 & 3 stars.,"But settled on 2 due to the rehashed material. If The Fever and The Promise (even in this bowlderized version) had been included on the original Tracks, that would have been a great set. As it is, Tracks is weakened by the exclusion of these two songs (among other less notorious omissions), and 18 Tracks is has only a few worthwhile songs (most notably Growin Up, Hearts of Stone, Born in the USA, Pink Cadillac & Brothers Under the Bridge, besides the new cuts). Of the new songs, The Fever is legitimately a great song. The Promise could be Springsteen's best song, although this version doesn't live up to it's full potential (I appreciate that The Promise is finally available, though). Trouble River is probably the worst song on the set."
3,Okay,I usually love all springsteen music but was not exactly thrilled with this CD. I do occasionally listen to it but not like the others.
4,It delivers the goods,"David Quantick of Emap Consumer Magazines is a very silly person. Springsteen is not capable of writing or playing a song that is ""accidentally trying to put people off rock music for ever"" as he snidely suggests. It's a bit late in the day for a critic to make his feeble name by slagging off world-class talents like Springsteen.The best stuff on this record sounds like exactly what it is; songs Springsteen left off his familiar albums because they didn't fit. In the liner notes, he says he thinks in retrospect some of these editing decisions were regrettable mistakes, and he's mostly right. I'm glad to have almost all of 'em at long last.The 4-disc box set of unreleased tracks may be too much of a good thing, but this set plays like greatest hits from an alternate universe. Go ahead, David Quantick, be enthusiastic. Springsteen has yet again improved your little world!"
1,Bleeding the Fans,"After shelling out big bucks for Tracks, I can't begin to describe my ire upon discovering that I would have to spend yet more money on this condensed version for the ""privilege"" of owning three popular, but rare, recordings that should have been included in the original collection.Screw you, Springsteen."
3,"Some great songs, some bad filler","I'm a big Bruce Springsteen fan, so I was excited to listen to 18 Tracks, a representative set of songs from Tracks, Bruce's set of (mostly) never-before released songs. Mixed with the better material, like a terrific acoustic version of Born in the U.S.A, which was originally recorded at the ""Nebraska"" sessions, and the pretty ""Sad Eyes"", are a lot of filler, especially from the late 70's period. Those songs show poor songwriting which is so rare from Springsteen. The better songs do balance things out, and there are also some good songs from the last several years."
3,"Bruce ""promises"" to sing like Tom Waits","Three new ""tracks"", otherwise just a sampler of the ""Tracks"" box set. Of the 3 new songs, Trouble River is just an attempt to squeeze something out of a typical Springsteen image-phrase. I'm sure many people questioned why the next two songs weren't released on Tracks. Why? So Columbia could save them for release on another CD. The Fever is from the E Street Shuffle sessions and bootleg copies received heavy radio play in the mid-70's. For this release the vocals and bass sound off to the side of the room when compared to the vinyl versions. The Promise is somewhat of a disappointment. This version was only recently recorded. The piano sounds similar to the song that was a late-70's concert favorite, although minus the accompanying ringing electric keyboard, but the 1999 vocals are mumble and slur. Sounds like it was done at 5 am when the coffee pot went dry at midnight. Lackluster. Nevertheless, it's good to see a lot of this material released."
1,26 years is enough,"OK enough is enough. First we had Human Touch and Lucky Town both at full price on the same day. Then we had the Greatest Hits album with the bonus tracks to make us shell out. Now the fans pay 40 for the Tracks set of which the great complaint is The Promise is missing and hey, guess what, a few months later it pops up on another sell out record.Bruce has always laid great store on his control over the whole recording process and his rights over his music (like the recent London court case). Sadly I guess that means he has to take responsibility for this prolonged rip off throughout the 90s."
4,This is why he's the boss,"A bit off an oddball, some good stuff, some average stuff and one or two outstanding tracks.The acoustic version of ""Born in the USA"" alone is worth the purchase price, but the real showstoppers are ""The Fever"" and ""The Promise"". What must be questioned is why songs of this calibre were not previously released. The album highlights why he is the Boss."
4,The Fever of tracks,Those who think this CD is another way to squeeze money from the fans don't need to buy it. Be with your lauzy bootlegs. For me PIRATE is not good. Any way The Fever is his definetly best track before 1975.
3,"Okay, despite finally releasing The Promise","""The Promise"" is a great song, and it's great to see it finally released, but the version released here is certainly not the best. ""The Fever"" is also a great song, and this version is excellent. ""Trouble River"" wasn't worth releasing. The extracts from ""Tracks"" are a mixed bag."
3,When you just have to have it all.,"If you're a Bruce fan you're buying this for three songs: ""The Fever,"" ""The Promise,"" ""Trouble River."" They're good tunes, but Southside does a better ""Fever,"" and the other two are fine, but the bottom line is this is not even a very good sampler of TRACKS, as there are much better songs on the box set. (""Roulette"" anyone?)Casual fans stay away; I wouldn't buy it until it hit the discount bin."
3,"Disappointing compilation, but...","I am a big fan of the Boss. This album has proved a considerable disappointment, however, even after repeated listenings. If these are the ""highlights,"" I'm hardly compelled to buy the full Tracks set. Seriously, how many of these songs are up to Bruce's usual high standards? To my ears, very few make the cut. Most are mediocre at best, and several are among the worst of his career: Part Man Part Monkey, Lion's Den, and Where the Bands Are, among others. In fact, without the ""bonus"" tracks, I'd rate this CD one or two stars. The three new songs are easily the best on the album, and The Promise in particular stands comfortably among Bruce's best ever. Pity these songs weren't included for all the folks who shelled out for the Tracks set..."
5,Wonderful Memories,"Although the whole collection is great, if you're a Bruce Springsteen fan, I really bought the CD for one song only--""The Fever"". I originally had these songs on an 8-track, so this specific song, ""The Fever"" brings great memories from the 70's."
4,Very fun album.,"I'm a relatively new convert to the Bruce Springsteen crazy fan club, but man -- once you start listening to this guy and his fantastic bands it's very hard to stop. You get drawn in and now I absolutely love his stuff. I bought this album early in my obsession, because I wasn't ready to spend all the money on the Tracks album. Now I figure that I'll probably end up buying that too... The song Janey Don't You Lose Heart is AMAZING. I could listen to it over and over again. I recommend this album for beginning Springsteen fans (along with the Greatest Hits album, although some die-hard fans might criticize me for that). But in my opinion, the Live 1975-1985 album is a very good collection of well-known and more rare Springsteen stuff. So as you become more obsessed with him (as I can imagine you probably will) you can buy the Live album. Enjoy!"
1,The bonus,I like Springsteen but that's too much. The bonus tracks in here are the fifteen you pay twice if you got the 'old' Tracks. And this time the bonus is not for you... Have this disk only if you have more money than the boss... or if you don't have and don't wanna buy 'Tracks'.
1,I FEEL CHEATED,"I can't believe Bruce would do this! I bought the ""Tracks"" box set for $40 and now I have to pay another $15 for three extra songs!? I am convinced that Bruce only cares about money, and he won't be happy untill he has every dime in my bank account! The E Street reunion is only an excuse to cash in further. If he cared at all about his fans he woulnd't have screwed us like this."
1,A Bad Move By A Great Artist,"I worship Bruce Springsteen. He and his music have provided me with joy for years. This album makes no sense. It has three songs people like me didn't get when we shelled out $60 for Tracks, and the selections from Tracks are, for the most part, mediocre. This CD might contain two or three of the best songs on Tracks, but the vast majority of the real treasures on Tracks didn't make it. For 25 years, Bruce Springsteen never let me down. This time, he did."
5,18 Tracks,"It is rare for an artists outtakes and demos to rival their recorded work, but in 18 Tracks you have exactly that. This is a great selection of some of the tracks from the main boxset and is fairly representative of what you are likely to expect. It is good album in it's own right and perfect for when you haven't got time for the whole boxset. The last three tracks do not feature on the original set so there is some incentive for die-hard fans to buy this as well, and 'The Promise' is one of my all time Springsteen favourites. Any of these tracks could of featured on an album. There are acoustic demos, full band rave ups and up to date outtakes. Bruce could always write a brilliant song, but these hidden tracks demonstrate just how prolific and constant his ability is. Worth every penny.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
4,great lotion,just the right amount of scent..used with yardley rose soap it is perfect. wish they sold it in stores still
2,It was ok.,I had a pretty high expectations of the smell... I dont like the smell. It was not nice smell... Not like a baby smell.
4,Good stuff,"So I got this for my mom because she was feeling nostalgic about the scent of Rose Milk lotion and how it reminded her of childhood. It made for a PERFECT mother's day gift -- I ordered three regular sized bottles. The only thing that concerned me was the packaging...it wasn't in the displayed pink bottle, but rather in a white bottle with simply a sticker of the Rose Milk brand logo etc. Once my mom opened it and tested a small amount on her hands she confirmed it was in fact the lotion she remembered. Glad it worked out and happy to have found this on Amazon (albeit a bit pricey for lotion, but worth it)."
5,Shirley Valentine -- My Hero!,"Love the movie! Love the soundtrack! Through the soundtrack you can relive the movie. Some titles are expanded and are wonderful to listen to. If you love the movie, you've got to have the soundtrack!"
2,dissapointed,the CD in weiminuche has changed and those changes are not in your book. further more this book says nothing regarding recommended camping spots and when to top off your water bottle.
3,"Nice section breakout, but left me with questions","I liked the section breakout and the elevation changes that were shown in each segment. There are comments in the text to certain features that are not shown on the map, which makes you turn to other resources to locate them. Overall: Worth the money, but room for improvement."
2,didn't work for me,"didn't work for me i tried a couple time but i didn't notice any difference and after the first three or four time i used it, one of the light went off."
1,"3 tries, no product or leaky product","I've tried purchasing this in 3 different places. The results are the same everywhere. Either you get no whitener in the package, or it is leaking all over the package."
1,Very disappointing,"I was so excited to get this product, but when it arrived, BOTH TIMES, the whitening product had leaked all over the package and was unusable. Big bummer!!"
4,Nice!,This whitener is really nice! Works great! Saw results within days!!!! Plus the pen is comes with last quite a while! Havent had to repurchase another yet!!! Highly recommend it for this great price!
4,famous book of hours beautifully presented,"This beautiful and richly illustrated book of hours was made for Catherine of Cleves on the occasion of her marriage to the Duke of Guelders. It was created around 1440 in Holland by an unknown artist. The illustrations are of biblical scenes;the latter 56 pages are suffrages with illustrations of various saints. It is unusual to find a book of hours that is so liberally illustrated.The first section of this book contains a useful and informative introductory essay. Following this, there are 160 color ilustrations (in the original size)with a brief commentary by the author.This book was originally released in 1966 and is now reissued at a very reasonable price. While I cannot claim to have seen the original manuscript, the colors of the reproductions, while quite acceptable, are somewhat hard and unnatural. Otherwise this is a beautifully produced book that will give great pleasure to fans of illuminated manuscripts."
4,"great art work, but no translation","considering this small book is printed at the orignal scale, the details are astonishing. the printing quality delievers the art work right to your hands. it is a superb full color reproduction. the introdution is an indepth study of the history of the two original copies and the process of reconstruction of the book. the related history, manuscript making of the time are well studied.however, the published book does not translate the Latin text in to any language i can understand. but, i guess, the text is just explaining what the picture is, which the editor always gave a longer explaination paragraph for every picture in the book, in modern eyes.this is one of the best reproduced manuscript available today."
3,A job cries to be redone,"The Hours of Catherine of Cleves is one of the most exquisite book of hours of all time! This edition is not doing justice to it. The colors are hash and unnatural, and the gold here masks the details of the prints without doing any good. Just go to the Morgan Library online exhibition to see for yourself how beautiful this book of hours actually is!I still suggest getting a copy of it so you can use it as a reference when you browse through the Morgan Library online exhibition. I got hold of a 1966 copy, it is much better than the 2002 edition. The color is still off, but the details are better. for example, golden peas are like peas, while in the 2002 edition, they are flat gold circles."
4,"Great, but lacking.","Yes, this set has almost all of Kurosawa's great films. However, in my opinion, a set that doesn't contain ""Ran"" (a MAJOR masterpiece on the King Lear story) and ""Dersu Uzala"" ( a minor masterpiece in Russian and about a marvelous wilderness guide in pre-revolutionary Siberia) is deficient. Ran is an overwhelming Japanese re-telling of the Lear story and is one of AK's last and best films. Dersu Uzala should be included if only because of the great photography of the Siberian woodlands; it's a good character study also. ""Dreams"" (another absent film) is a good film, but is a bit quirky. I think that the absence of ""Rhapsody In August"" is justified, because it's a sentimental mess centered around the A-Bomb and survivors of Nagasaki. That's a compelling frame for a film, but Richard Gere as part Japanese??... puhleeese.One does not really need this set in order to study AK's style and broad strokes; a few of his famous films suffices. But the absence of ""Ran"" is ridiculous."
3,Yojimbo (1961) - Akira Kurosawa,"Yojimbo is both an influential film and an incredible mess. Kurosawa never finds the right balance between the comedic and violent moments in the film. The cinematography is nice, but the film is often too contained indoors. The performances from some of his usual collaborators is good, but the film just doesn't live up to it's lofty reputation. The pace of the film is slow, and you never become emotionally invovled with the charcaters to really care what happens to them. Kurosawa is a great filmmaker, and has made much better films like High and Low (1963). And like High and Low, Kurosawa is his best when working in contemporary times."
2,Two words: non-anamophic,"Ok, we all know the film is brilliant, but this DVD rates very low. The transfer is non-anamorphic, and the subtitles are placed out of frame. This means that if you have a widescreen set and you need to see the subtitles, you are stuck with a very small image. Not only that, but the resolution of the image isn't nearly as high. It's unprofessional and stupid to format any widescreen DVD this way, especially something as awesome as a Kurosawa film."
5,Pointing Out Again,"I've done a longer review of this film already... but i'd like to take the opportunity here to point out once again that Kurosawa himself said that the original story of this film is adapted without credit from a USAn gangster novel by Dashiell Hammett,""Red Harvest"".For another handling of the story (taking off directly from the Hammett, rather than via ""Yojimbo"") check out David Drake's SF novel, ""The Sharp End"""
4,Not as good as most of Kurosawa's work,"As usual, this DVD rendition of a Kurosawa film has almost no extras. Having become accustomed to this as part of the price of owning one of his works, I can only judge this on the merits of the film itself. The acting was good (Mifune's superb), directing and photography excellent, and script OK. Why OK? Well, our hero's power and fate seem to depend more on the improbable stupidity of his antagonists than his own cleverness. Can anyone believe the town bosses could rise to and hold their positions with such gullibility? If this is meant to be comedic, it borders on the cartoonish. Nevertheless, it is my compliment to Kurosawa that, while one of his lesser films, Yojimbo is well worth my time, and Hollywood's compliment that Fistful Of Dollars is an almost scene-for-scene knock-off. Ignoring the DVD's lack of features, I give this a 3.5."
4,One of Kurosawa's greatest films.,"Toshiro Mifune is exceptional in one of greatest roles. He plays the playful, vagabond samurai Yojimbo. As he enters a town torn apart by an age-old gang battle, he decides to clean up the mess in his own unique way. The character of Yojimbo is so infectious that the audience is immediately drawn to him. Although cool to the end, he shows that his righteousness is far above those around him. Mifune stamps his claim to be one of cinema's greatest treasures in the role he'll be remembered for. Amazingly, Sanjuro - the sequel - is even better!"
3,"Great movie, unfaithfull presentation.","Eventhough this is one of the greatest movie from Criterion collection, I can't say this is recommended for anyone who loves this film. likewise ""Yozimbo"", Criterion did not use new print for this DVD edition. Instead, they used same transfer from their old LaserDisc version. The print is not in good condition, neither is the soundtrack. The more pathetic thing is that you can't see all of samurais filled on the screen. Most of the time, ten samurais, including Mifune Toshiro, are fit in widescreen originaly. But in here, one or two samurais are missing in left or right side. This is almost pan & scan! I want to know why Criterion did not use Hi-Difinision transfer from Japanese LD version approved by director himself? (Did you know that one of his film ""High & Low"" is in 4-track surround stereo?). I realy hope that when they releace ""Red beared"" on DVD, they'll have the best transfer......"
5,a complaint about collections,"I think it's wonderful that Criterion is honoring AK in this way, but here's my problem. Anyone with an interest in AK's films has probably already shelled out a couple hundred dollars for just the half dozen (or so) films they most treasure, i.e. the best of the lot. That means spending $300 more for the rest, the ones with less value for the purchaser. In a way, those who have never bought a Kurosawa film are in the enviable position of getting a great set at a great price. The rest of us are essentially paying double for the same items. Nothing against Criterion - this is true of most collections on DVD, but especially the ones that confine a new release to a set of readily available discs (I wonder if this will happen with Drive He Said on the forthcoming Jack Nicholson collection?). I would really prefer to honor AK by releasing all these films, sans extras, at something like $10/disc. Then I'd buy a dozen of the ones I want, instead of nothing."
5,Kurosawa: the untiring genius working!,"Under the perspective of forty elapsed years it 's easy to understand the narrow existent distance respect to ""High and Low"" or ""The Bad sleep well"" in which Kurosawa develops similar concerns.A peculiar Samurai (Toshiro Mifune in another terrific performance) is recruited as teacher and spiritual guide in nasty corrupt times (any similarity with those times is a simple coincidence). He will advise and help against this villain, through a set of admirable vignettes and fabulous sense of humor.This the sequel to Yojimbo."
3,Great movie - bad DVD,"If you haven't seen this movie before, by all means buy this DVD. It is an excellent story by an excellent director with an excellent lead actor. However, if you have seen the movie before, or have seen other Criterion productions, then steer clear of this print. The contrast of the picture is good. But the actual movie often has lines and scratches throughout. I find it hard to believe that this is the only print that Criterion could utilize in making the DVD. Likewise, the opening credits are in English, instead of in Japanese like the Seven Samurai or Hidden Fortress DVDs. These English credits spill off the screen, and this is sort of a prelude to the quality of the rest of the DVD. Indeed, the film quality of the older Kurosawa movies issued by Criterion is far better than that of Yojimbo.So, buy this movie for the adventure and the exciting story. But if its quality photography you are after, just beware. Criterion usually does a good job but this ain't one of them."
4,Samurai with no name,"A nameless ronin arrives at a village where two criminal factions are battling for supremacy while the peasants cower in fright. ""In this town I'll make a lot of money for killing,"" he muses, ""and there are a lot of people who need to be killed."" Establishing a reputation as an expert fighter early on, he soon has both factions bidding for his services and takes advantage of the chaotic situation to inflict damage on both of them while surreptitiously aiding the peasants. Toshiro Mifune excels as a rogue who seems amoral on the surface, and director Akira Kurosawa demonstrates the filmmaking skill that made him a legend."
5,AK 100: 25 Films of Akira Kurosawa (Criterion Collection),Wonderful Boxed Set. Lovely quality collectable set. Would have really liked the option of commentary during the movie - always interesting to hear about the details. Book very nice.
4,Not YOJIMBO.,"SANJURO reintroduces us to the hero from YOJIMBO, the invincible mercenary portrayed wonderfully by Toshiro Mifune. This movie was apparently made at the insistence of the producers, due to the overwhelming success of YOJIMBO. While amusing, the plot is contrived, often silly, and does not have the cynical power of the script of the previous film. Mifune is creditable enough in recreating the character, but it just doesn't work as well. Still and all, it's Kurosawa at work, so it remains a fun movie to watch. Just don't waste your time trying to compare it to YOJIMBO, for it won't measure up."
5,A Must!!,If you are a favorite of korusawa this is a must. This film as others such as 7 Samurais are the basic for the famous spagettiwesterns that made Clint Eastwood famous. The coresponding Eastwood film to Yojimbo is an exact copy. I do beleive however that Korusawa in his black and white captures the people and details few other directors can match.Get it!!
2,a bad misstep,"It's hard to believe this is a Kurosawa film. Other reviewers have liked it but is a pale shadow of the magnificent Yojimbo. Everything that made the latter great is missing.Mifune just shows up. No buildup.The young men he helps out aren't worth his time and all are faceless.The villains are all the same. Not one is memorable. Even the great Tatsuya Nakadai, so outstanding in Yojimbo, has no personality at all. His death, though, is ""interesting.""The terrible comedy weakens whatever plot there is. It advances the story in Yojimbo, though, and Daisuke Kato, as Nakadai's older brother, is hilarious though he doesn't mean to be.And, worse of all, there's no one to root for.Skip this and get Stray Dog, a Kurisawa film finally getting the credit due it. It is one of kurosawa's four or five greatest films and has been overlooked for nearly fifty years."
3,Funny but still kinda boring,"Toshiro Mifune plays a samurai who's just lookin' for trouble. He comes to a town, lops off some arms, get's beat up, and then ingages in a battle at the end. It's really hilarous watching Mifune chop guy's plastic limbs off. Funniest scene: Dog carries a man's hand around in his mouth. Tape is letterboxed and subtitled"
2,Doesn't translate well to a non Japanese audience,"This film used to be shown a lot in double bills with Yojimbo. It is a very different film and not as good. Where as Yojimbo is about a self confident swaggering warrior, Sanjuro is based on a very different story. It is about a samurai who is cowardly but cunning. It is a sort of joke or playing against type which would make a lot of sense to Japanese audiences but can leave western audiences scratching their heads.The film is also reasonably talky and is set largely in interior settings. The inside of a house, gardens and so forth.The plot involves the cowardly samurai who helps a number of younger samurai overcome an evil lord. A well made film but a dissapointment after the Seven Samurai or Yojimbo."
3,Antithesis of Yojimbo,"Kurosawa Productions, Inc. released ""Sanjuro"" [aka Tsubaki Sanjuro] in response to the popular reaction to the excellent ""Yojimbo."" And what a falling off was there. What was once both cinematically deft and funny became merely funny. The swordplay in ""Sanjuro"" is adroit, but it serves no other purpose than itself. The comedic element is reduced to a juvenile subtext involving the salvation of a group of worthless (but, oh so cute) young samurai. Mifune wasted his time. So did Kurosawa. And so did us all."
5,Great Service!,The product arrived earlier than the said delivery date. This was a V-Day gift for my husband..so surprised and so happy!
1,the worst of Kurosawa's black-and-white samurai films,"I'm not sure why Kurosawa is so invariably highly-regarded: was it because he didn't have much competition? He made a couple of great samurai films, but after seeing several of them, they get to be a bit repetitive.If you're going to watch several of them, I would save this one for last: it's probably the worst of that lot. Hammy acting, a confused script, obtrusive score, campy directing, and an uneven tone make this a forgettable outing. Unconvincing combat scenes and no real memorable scenes at all, other than the ""footstool."" In fact, most of the action of this film takes place indoors, a bad sign for a samurai film.Characterization is also cackhanded: the only reason Sanjuro seems different from everybody is because Mifune is the only one using method acting."
3,DVD vs Blueray,And when can we expect a Blu-ray release of this set. Or would those be made available one by one?
1,Save your money!,"I recently ordered the book and it looked great based upon the contents and other reviews. The book needs rewritten as it lacks substance (details), is difficult to read, and is WAY overpriced! It is more like a summary of what needs to be done, yet lacks the details of the process. I was sorely dissappointed with this book! Anyone want a... copy?"
3,Over rated,"I bought these blocks for my new granddaughter who is 8 months old. I thought the fact that they came from the Discovery Store insured quality and educational value. I was greatly disappointed. Babies this age love to take things out of and put back in a container. This product was advertised with the nice container which is pictured. However, it is cheap plastic, so cheap that there was a caution like you get with a dry cleaning bag! So the case was not in fact part of the toy. Also, the blocks themselves are much larger than I imagined when they were described. All in all, a good idea, but not as advertised. If I had to do over, I would have purchased the Fisher Price purse with stuff to put in. I would not recommend this product."
2,Last Jill Winters book I'll read,"I was not impressed with this book at all. I thought the characters were corny and superficial. If you like funny, contemporary romances with great, in-depth characters, don't waste your time with Ms. Winters - try Rachel Gibson or Susan Elizabeth Phillips instead. They definitely won't disappoint you like this book will."
2,Odd Man Out,"It must be me. I fought my way through this book. There were way too many odd ball characters. There was not one normally functioning employee at Lonnie's office. That didn't work on television for me, and it falls flat here. A few idiosyncracies are great for comic relief and to move the plot along, but a chronic diet of them strains the plot.Too much time was spent on the insanity at Twit and Bell and too little time on the romance between the characters. The murder of one of the partners was glossed over and barely noticeable. It could have been petty office theft for all the impact it made on the story. I did like Peach and her interference in Lonnie's life, but she wasn't around enough to make the book more enjoyable."
4,plum xxx rated,"I'm trying to be fair, this is a good read for those who like xxx rated books,but there was nothing about this book saying how detailed the sex was, I think it should have a warning on the cover for the very young readers,i have young readers in my family & I would not be happy, for them to read something like this. The book cover looks like a cute & fun read."
5,L.O.D. - Def Squad,"Keith Murray steps out for another dictionary rhyme book tales with another album entitled Enigma. He impressively both used a vocabulary to conversant with scholars and entertained his listeners with tales of adventure with titles like ""World Be Free"" and the heartfelt ""To My Mans"" featuring Dave Hollister. As he begins by antagonizing others on ""Intro"" it continues over to ""Call My Name"" as he dares any competition to contest. ""Dangerous Ground"" featuring 50 Grand is more upbeat than usual for Keith, but his ability to adapt nearly passes by. The highlight of this LP is ""What A Feelin'"" with its groovy, scale runs with the bass. ""Love L.O.D."" featuring 50 Grand & Kel-Vicious is a good display of patience and the tight knit of L.O.D. as the trio shows why they are the nicest in this profession. To close, Keith Murray's Enigma is lyrically fulfilling."
5,YEAH!!!!,"The BEST album from Keith Murray!!! All the songs have keiths signature lyricism and Def squad beats to keep your head knockin'! Don't sleep, Keith's a genuis with the words!"
4,Super-hip,"Hive is a fantastic musician. I heard Devious Methods before this and it blew my mind, really got me into drumnbass and hiphop. Finally I did my homework and got this cd, and I am very pleased. Most of the tracks are superjazzy, not a lot of boom-boom-krack stuff goin on... He changes the melody and beat up a lot, which is always nice. Very good instrumental hiphop. This album sounds a lot like DJ Shadow's work, but with a helluva lot more evil-genius behind it."
4,Cleveland 1986 is Very Good,I love almost all Tangerine Dream compositions. All of their live albums have been very good to excellent! This one flows well from one compossition to the next.
4,"I Do, I DO! musical",wonderful show and cast and memories for those who were lucky enought to see the broadway show. the sound track will harken one back to those glory days of Broadway.
2,"Academic, mannered, boring - the Coen Brothers of poets","This is sepia-toned, art-directed, self-important, highly artificial work by someone who loves ""literature"" - and rightly so - but feels she can produce it herself simply through intelligence and learning. The miseries of reading this book are legion - pompous enjambment, moments of ""shock,"" Frostian copybook grimness, dull exposition, the fancy that a whole world is being produced - when it is all Linda, Linda, Linda. Gregerson has a mildly interesting mind which clearly amuses itself - but not the rest of us. To quote her - and note the oh-so-daring enjambments -... myhour with you (onebreath, one more) was theftof an otherwise perfectly good hour."
2,Full disclosure,"Buyer beware : nowhere on the packaging does it say so, but this CD is a live recording. In fact, it is an abbreviated version of the ""Twisted Sister Live at Hammersmith"" CD. The performances are fine, but a little truth in advertising would have been appreciated. Dee Snider is a great performer, but the long raps between and during songs pall after repeated listenings.Added note : Word is that BMG has agreed to stop production of this unauthorized CD and recall all of the ones that are in stores. It will possibly be re-released in the future with a less misleading cover and title."
5,TWISTED SISTER WILL RISE AGAIN,TWISTED MAY NOT BE THE BEST BUT THEY ARE THE MOST FUN TO LISTEN TO. THIS CD IS SURE TO BE GREAT BY THE WAY CHECK OUT THE NEEW TS AND DEE STUFF ON STRANGELAND
1,abiility to review album tracks in order to purchase/not purchase. I can't purchase unknown content.,"I must be able to see the tracks on the albums, this and all Los Incas albums in particular, as there are a select number of tunes I'm interested in. It is frustrating these are not available. I don't know where or why the breakdown in what I consider absolutely vital data. It makes the difference to me, whether I buy, or don't buy, which should make a critical difference to Amazon. I am one of thousands with this complaint/regret,; to Amazon it translates to lost profit."
5,"Score from ""Damn Yankees""",I thoroughly enjoy my cd of the score of the movie Damn Yankees. It came from Amazon when it was supposed to and lived up to all the advertisement about it. Thanks again.
3,Never got it,"This is not a product review but an Amazon service review. I ordered this and received the wrong cd. I followed all the instructions, sent it back and asked for a replacement. I never got it, nor did I get a credit. I have since ordered and received the cd from Barnes and Noble and it's a fun recording - almost the same cast as the broadway show."
1,Defective,"The motor was mounted off center, and the fan blades hit the inside of the case when they spun. This unit should never have passed quality control."
4,Criminally overlooked...,"...by nearly everyone except certain rock critics, this album sold poorly, because very few people heard it. Not nearly ""aggro"" enough for commercial rock radio programmers, and too dark for any other format, this album nonetheless stood out as one of 1999's very best. Impassioned performances and top-notch writing are here in abundance, for fans of intelligent, literate rock."
4,Class of `76,"C'mon, David.....more music like this. Good album but I love ""Twentieth Century Chemical"" even better.If you love early Bowie, you'll love these."
5,"Without question, my album of the year!","Anyone who considers themselves a connoiseur of fine music will not be disappointed with this band. Musically, these guy's (and girl) have put together a sometimes ""edgy"" recording, layered with a mysterious and artsy sound. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention the straight-on powerhouse rock which is laced throughout the recording; subsequent listenings yield more and more instrumental nuggets (get a load of the violin). The lyrics are a bit dark-but targeted, and conjur up some pretty dreamy, and frequently familiar images. The overall production is simply outstanding. Adding this CD to your collection is risk free, as long as you are a wee bit adventurous."
5,Great Book!,"If you are into thrilling true stories then buy this book! It was really great, I couldn't put it down after i started. The stories were well written and you could actually picture them like it was on the tv. Trust me, you will love this book."
5,Outstanding,"I have read many books about bears attacks and McMillions ""Mark OF The Grizzly"" ranks up there with the best of them. It was a well written read and will be on the shelf next to Herrero and Shelton. Mark of the Grizzly gave not only the perspective of the attack survivors at times bt also of the bear. It is also obvious the Author deeply cares about the animals in the writing of this book. I would highly recommend this book for anyone interested in the subject."
4,GRIZMAN,"I love this book .........fun and entertaining, though gory and spooky as the reviews suggest."
1,Yuck! Way Too Politically Correct!,"I started reading this and stopped because it's chock full of PC stupidity (bells, bears prefer berries to human, etc.). I don't recommend bothering with this book. Try Tom Hron's book ""Fighting for your Life: Man-eater Bears"" instead, I think you will find it a much better read.I'm very tired of getting the PC stuff in books about predators and other wildlife. I very much prefer a more reality based kind of thinking that isn't bogged down in some fake enviro-weenie agenda.I'd avoid this book if I were you."
5,The best bear attack book I have read!,"I have read three bear attack books altogether, but this is my favorite by far. Actually, the first story is the best of the whole book. The author did a superb job in getting in depth interviews with the victims, the victims families, and park rangers about the attack.He also tells the true storys in an suspenseful and actionlike way. I was pretty into the book and couldnt put it down. I recommend this book to everyone."
1,Rediculous,"The bear attack stories are very good in this book however I can't get past the tree hugging, gun hating flavor of these stories that is the underlying agenda of this book. It frequently encourages bear spray and makes rediculous statements such as no one has time to use a gun during attacks so they are useless. Yet in many stories multiple people use their spray only to further anger the bears and get some more of their face chewed off! Makes no since to me. If you go out in the wilderness without adequate defenses than your not very smart. A 400-500 lb grizzly will not be phased by some pepper spray get real people! Stop being pusses and protect yourself or stay out of the woods!!! That's just my opinion! This book would have been better if the writer left his opinion and evident dislike of firearms out of the story telling!"
4,Importance of Preserving the Grizzy Bear,"I have read an enormous amout of material pertaining to grizzly bears going back to the work done by the Craigheads. The plus side of this book is that it makes clear that a gun(s) will not stop a grizzy but that red pepper spray will, most of the time stop a grizzly bear attack AFTER you have made enough noise as to not surprise a grizzly whether it's eating or has cubs, etc. I am in favor of NOT removing it's endangered species designation which is being pushed for now. They are an important part of the earth's eco system and if you are intent in hiking in areas that have grizzlies then you must accept the risk as well. To get a balanced view of living among grizzy bears read other literature like ""True Grizz"" written by biologist Doug Chadwick. Man can live with grizzly bears--with great care."
3,"Interesting and informative, but preachy.","When the author went out of his way to preach his own bias about the relationship between bears and mankind, his book lost a little of its luster in my view. I am not of the opinion that man is the bad guy, and that we should give way to the bears. Bears are not man's equals."
5,Terrifying.,"I first saw this book in the hands of my Dad a few weeks ago. Then in my older brothers. They both were very intrested in this book so i asked my mother to read it to me. I think i may never leave our family ranch and hed off into the forest again. Bears killing humans and eating them may not scare my dad and brother but it sure scared the pants off of me. I always thought that all bears were always cute and playful, who whould have thought. Scott McMillion did a great job on this book. It takes a very good or very funny writer to get me into a book and this man has done it. I applued him(i hope i spelt that right). Even though it may be quite some time before i will want to see a bear again."
2,"Due for a revised edition, more like reading a novel","Chapter was fun and interesting to read. Written like a story, describing the characters involved, going outside what is relevant to the grizzly relating topic. That is not wrong by itself but just shows the 'novel' style of the book. It mentions bite marks in a wallet, then never mentions if they were used to identify the bear, the outcome of not having identified the destroyed bears with 100% certainty suggests it didn't.Chapter 2 is mainly about Banff, back in 1998, this chapter needs a complete rewrite, it's old and out of date.I found the book lacked scientific structure, that is, systematic and consistent.If you are looking for an entertaining book, it's fine, fore bear behavior and analysis, Herrero's book is much better structured and focused on bear behavior."
4,Excellent tactical overview of nymphing techniques,"A very easy to read discussion of tactics and tips. Very enjoyable read as well. If only I could get my friends Bill and Dave to read it, they might catch fish."
3,what happened?,"this book, we are told, was originally a manuscript of 1,308 pages. i mention this because one comes upon paragraphs here and there that seem part of a longer work. the first chapters are by far the best with the narrative smooth and the early years ""fleshed out"". however, when bowles' artistic carreer begins so do the problems, which may have to do with the tremendous job of cutting out 3/4 of the original manuscript.the book contains no new important information or point of view but there are some new details here and there ( mainly about press runs, money matters and sexual partners).ms. carr travelled 13 times to tangier for her research, arranged for bowles' medical operations in the u.s.a. and had her subject as a house guest for 3 months. however, bowles' literary executor refused to authorize this biography. we are not told why."
4,Nice compilation,"Song list:#01 Juuni Genmu Kyoku(Piano Arranged Version)#02 Rakkou(Piano Solo)#03 Shihouka(Piano Solo)#04 Kuni ... Seinau Hibiki(Piano Arranged Version)#05 Yoake ... Ryochou(Piano Arranged Version)#06 Touhou Raisan ... Minimal China(Piano Arranged Version)#07 Itsumono Asa ... Yokan#08 Koshinkyou(Piano Arranged Version)#09 Yasou Getsuka(Piano Arranged Version)#10 GenkoushinshoThis is a nice compilation, and is good to listen to. Definitely recommend to people who have seen the anime."
3,Artistically Beautiful,"I purchased this volume thinking that it would be covering the history of Lindisfarne in the early days; however, the section dealing with the period 300 BC to 300 AD was scant and not particularly accurate. Why? Because, this book was more focused on the arts and naturalistic reader whereby it did a wonderful job. The quality of this volume was excellent with thick glossy pages and supurb color and photography. The entire transaction was fast and easy."
5,A very good and authentic cuisine textbook!,"This is a very good food textbook, simple, clear, easy, no gimmicky or outrageous and so-called innovative modern Chinese nouvelle cuisine, such as those made up in ""Susanna Foo Chinese Cuisine."" The other one that I found as authentic as it is ""Mrs. Chiang's Szechwan Cookbook"" by Ellen Schrecker and her husband. Only the latter is so authentically Chinese that you may have to reduce certain fat from the ingrdients by using leaner stuff."
4,London's underworld exposed in work of intrigue and romance.,Taylor Chase has written a wonderful story full of intrigue and passion. The pages of the book crackle with the combustible chemistry between Vivian and Rafe. The story moves quickly and provides a thoroughly enjoyable ride. Taylor Chase creates a rich romance and a delightful read.
2,This was more of a mystery than a romance. It was a good story but a little too heavy with details for me.,"I had to take notes while reading to keep track of all the different names and activites. I prefer books that don't make me concentrate and work so hard. Readers who love mysteries would probably enjoy this more than I.Rafe's grandfather and brother are imprisoned due to suspected treason, sending defective weapons to the front in Queen Elizabeth's army. Rafe's best friend was killed in connection with this. Rafe goes undercover to work for Nick and Vivian Swift who control the underworld in a section of London. He believes they were involved. The back story of how Nick and Vivian became crime bosses is also told.Sexual language: moderate. Number of sex scenes: nine. Setting: 1586 London. Copyright: 1999. Genre: historical romantic mystery."
4,"what a man, what a man, what a woman","I highly recommend this book to readers of romance. I have never before read a romance where the hero blushes as much as Rafe does. Queen Viv really did remind me of everything the today type of women. She knows what she wants and she gets it. Her past experience is not a hinderance to her relationship with Rafe. He is very accepting of who she is and I think does not try to change her.The very explicit love scenes were just enough to keep me interested in the book, but what really kept me reading was the emotion between the two characters. They both were so strong that they had such a hard time expressing how they really felt toward each other."
3,cute,"This is a cute purple toe ring. I love how bright the purple is. Just be careful because sometimes it can poke you. Besides that, its great"
5,thought provoking and sobering,"The detailed historical perspective that the author brought to the subject of regimes was important. This is not an easy book to read. First of all, fhe reader must stay focused on what he/she is reading. Secondly, it is heart wrenching to understand what has happened to our country in the past century, particularly in the past couple of decades. All in all, if you are a patriot, this is a must read."
1,Drivel masquerading as Research,"If one is a hard core survivalist, creationist, Neo-John Bircher, Birther, and former Klan, this book is for you. No thought required, just follow the rooter's guide and qeues from the cheering section.What might have been an interesting treatise useful on cross-cultural relations is prepackaged ""argument"" for the next spate of emails."
3,bowling shirt,"Took a while to get, kinda cheap, strings hanging off it and part of the collar was sewn together wrinkled, (so it's permanent) but hey, what do you want for $30? Well, something a little nicer maybe?"
1,Don't mess up!,"Hey, don't mess up on your order! They make it most unprofitable to return an erroneous order. Just keep it and move on."
4,Nice product,"These gel caps are very simple to fill by hand. I ordered the 00 size and they are easy to swallow. My only issue was that I am filling these capulets with liquid stuff and they break down fairly quickly, so if you are planning on putting liquid in these make sure you fill and take right after. Now that I take the pills as soon as they are filled, instead of filling multiple capulets then taking them I have had no problems at all. They arrived with in the projected time, and packaged ok. They came in a padded mainilla envelope which was fine, however if the envelope had been beat up much more I'm afraid the out come would not have been positive. Over all I would order this product again."
4,They Work Well For Me,"I use these gel caps for meds for one of our pets. They've been a life saver because they've cut down on the number of pills we have to administer. My only quibble is that sometimes as soon as you open the empty capsule, the material warps a bit and you can't close the pill once you've filled it."
1,the caps are good but you may not get the right size,Be careful ordering your capsules from this seller and Amazon in general. This is the second time I have ordered capsules apparently from 2 different sellers and gotten the wrong ones. Both times I ordered 00 size caps and was sent 0 size. The first seller was very quick to make things right but this seller was very slow to even email me. I ended up having to keep and use these size 0 caps because it was 2 weeks before I even got them and I had run out of my supply.They will let you send them back but so far its been about a month and this item still has the deceptive option button and you will get the wrong item. Better luck to you.
5,No problem,"No problems here, except I ordered the wrong size one time, this is a good price on enough caps to keep you going for a while."
2,Just okay,This one got a little bogged down--I lost interest halfway through. had to force myself to read on...really a shame.
4,A good read but too much information,"Okay, I admit I loved the first book. I like this book. But, just a little too many teasers. A possible book about their little girl, a definate book about her Isadora, the woman found in the prison etc. Please, I would have rather have had a book just about Rhys and Judith. I really liked the shapeshifter concept and was really interested in his life, but I was disappointed by the resolution. It was a little fast form me."
2,Rebels In Arms,"Weaver's imagination is good, but perhaps a little too good. His battle scenes are confusing and unrealistic. I didn't read the prequel, and many of the hero's talents seem to have been explained there (ability to teleport, survive repeated gunfire, etc.) The hero is indestructable, yet kills hundreds of the enemy single-handedly. I struggled just to finish the book.On the plus side, his characterization is pretty good. I'd give him only 2 stars for this one."
5,Even better than the first!!,"Continuing the saga started in Brothers in Arms, Ben Weaver spins a masterful story telling more of the fascinating Scott St. Andrew and his fellow soldiers. St. Andrew continues to be the reluctant hero, torn by the events of a war stretching across many star systems. As the tale continues, it becomes more and more apparent that Weaver has spent a considerable period of time developing the setting/universe in which he has placed his stories. Many of the cliffhangers from the first novel are resolved in the second... but more arise to be answered in a third novel. My only regret was that I finished the novel in only one day -- I couldn't put it down! Mr. Weaver, please hurry the next one along!"
5,Best book ever.,Rebels in Arms is the perfect end to a perfect series. My favorite part is how believable the characters are. When I read the book I was living it through Scott st Andrews eyes. Ben has certainly outdone himself with this one. It is the best book I have ever had the pleasure of reading and I recommend it to anyone who hasn't taken the time to go through it. It is the best thing to happen to literature since Lord of the Rings. His are the stories that I will remember for the rest of my life.
4,Good Sipping Chocolate,"It's not easy to find sipping chocolate like this. Trader Joe's sometimes carries similar sipping chocolate during the Christmas season, but one can find the Bellagio product throughout the year from Amazon and other online sources. Although it comes in the same metal container and has a similar dark-chocolate flavor, the Bellagio sipping chocolate is not identical to Trader Joe's. I like both products, especially when added to coffee, and feel they are quite similar in texture, color, and flavor. I've been happy with Amazon's price and service, although my most recent order was delayed a few days because the item was out of stock (even though when I ordered it the site indicated that four tins were available)."
2,Kitchen Boy,The story is obviously fiction written to seem like a true story. I found the ending contrived. It was required reading for a reading club. Sorry I bought it and wasted so much time.
3,not as meticulous as claimed...,"I am enjoying reading it, I have studied this period extensively and am myself a historian. However, I am not even a quarter of the way through and have found sloppy research.The Catherine Palace was built to honor Catherine the First, NOT Catherine the Great (aka Catherine the Second). They tell you that the second you walk in the door, it is in the first paragraph on wikipedia. If he is missing basic easy facts like that I can only think that the rest is pure fiction, which would be fine if he wasn't claiming that it is full of historic facts.I love the premise, I will certainly finish reading the books, but I am disappointed."
4,Great book.,"The book brings the Tsar and his family closer to us as if we were living with them in their imprisonment. I know it's fiction, but it reads so well, you'll want to know more about them, their culture, and the circumstances surrounding their imprisonment."
2,Ending is borderline offensive,"Up until the last 15 pages of this book, I admit I really enjoyed it. I think the author did a splendid job of weaving facts and fiction into a well-written and gripping story about what really happened to the Romanovs. While I agree that this portion of the book was very respectful to the family, I felt the ""plot twist"" at the end was both unnecessary and offensive. I cannot imagine any world in which that ending could possibly have taken place. The book would still have been a very good read without the massive plot twist in the epilogue, but with the plot twist, it becomes quite tasteless. I would never have guessed that an epilogue could undo the excellent qualities of the rest of the book, but this one succeeded."
3,Twist on the Romanovs,"This book starts out similar to other Romanov stories emphasizing the family's devotion to each other and God. The story was somewhat slow with most of the real action and plot twists taking place in the final chapters. If you prefer accuracy in your historical fiction, you may be disappointed. This was a factor in my rating, as was the repetitiousness."
5,Enjoyed it a lot,"A good book, with an original approach, written with respect for the main characters and easy to read and enjoy."
2,"Interesting facts, imaginative plot, overly simplistic writing","""Wait for a whistle towards midnight... Such enticing words. To the ends of the earth Romeo could have thus enticed his Juliet, Heathcliff his Cathy, even Zhivago his Lara."" Please!!! If this is a romance novel, the cover is all wrong. If this book is meant for young teenagers, something should flag that on the cover. I found the simplistic, over the top style distracting at every turn, and it just prevented me from enjoying the story and the historical perspective that, clearly, Mr Alexander possesses quite well."
5,Great Travel Read,"I bought this book in the Hermitage Museum shop in '05. It's great for a short travel book. Filled with history, plus a good mystery mixed in."
3,"Light on history, light on depth","Although I did enjoy parts of this book, which was a quick read, I felt that it did not do more than skim the surface of this critical event in world history. I felt the author repeated himself as he tried to build to the suspense of the family's last days, especially when referencing the hidden jewels and forshadowing of the final hours, as well as how the general population may have felt towards the Tsar and Tsarina. Again, too little depth. There is a little bit of a surprise ending, but I was not engaged enough with the characters to feel strongly about the ""truth"". More like ""oh"" instead of ""oh my"". I am very interested in this family and would like to learn more, but this is not a strong source. This novel lacked the richness that could have, or should have, created great compassion for the characters."
2,Ugh.,"Robert Alexander presents the story of Leonka, kitchen boy to the doomed Romanov family, and tells the story - through Leonka's eyes - of the days leading up to the Romanovs' murder. Told through the eyes of 90 year old Mikhail, who took that name after his time spent as this kitchen boy, he is now living in Chicago and writing the never-before-told real story for his granddaughter.Alexander spent years traveling to Russia, and apparently had access to the previously sealed Russian archives. This story is detailed, it is thorough, and it is very boring. Ugh. It might provide a more accurate understanding of those final days, but it's still mostly a fictional story - and a bad one at that."
2,A Waste of Time,"After reading Massie's, Nicholas and Alexandra I thought The Kitchen Boy would be a positive experience but instead it was a disappointment. There is far too much unconfirmed detail of the Romanov's time in captivity and their murders that detracts from the sensitivity surrounding this tragedy. Why is it necessary to keep the myth of survivors alive? This is a waste of time if you are searching for authenticity of Romanov history."
4,good historical novel,"The Romanov family and the Russian Revolution are so fascinating. This was good fiction set in factual history, which made it all the more entertaining."
4,The Kitchen Boy: A Novel of the Last Tsar,Quite a good read but sometimes the storyline was a little slow. Provided a good overview of historical events given I had previously not known much about Russian history during this time.
2,Unbelievable plot,"A dedicated fan of the Romanovs may find this book worth reading for its faithful recreation of the family's last days. As a novel, however, the book is seriously flawed. The story-within-a-story format is clumsily handled - the narrator goes off on long tirades about things that don't advance the plot at all, and spouts some tiresome (and cliched) opinions about the downfall of the Romanovs. Everything that happens after the murder of the family is completely unbelievable. It's like the author was trying to show off how torturous a plot he was able to dream up, without understanding that plots have to be character-driven. The character of Kate, on whose behalf the story is being told, is a thin and unconvincing one. This would have been a much better book if it had been done as a simple, fictionalized account of the Romanov murders without trying to turn it into a suspense novel. I give it 2 stars for atmosphere."
5,Riveting story which kept me up late!,"I'm not usually much of a mystery reader, but I've always been interested in the last days of the Czar and his family.It was an excellent book but the sudden twists in the story at the end kept me up late and moved it into the outstanding category. I've recommended this book to several friends.This would make a terrific movie!"
5,Best shoe ever!!,These are probably the most comfortable sneaker I have worn since I was a kid! The color is a perfect match to the shoe shown and the price is AWESOME (I've seen the exact same shoe elsewhere for twice as much!). I will DEFINITELY purchase these again!
4,fun but frusterating game,"I think that this is a really fun game and all, but it is really frusterating trying to get past that seventh level. If anyone has some advice for me it would be really appreciated. The reason I rate this game with four stars overall is because of the thought they put into making it but it would have been five stars if it had anything to do with the fabled princess Zelda from the other games. But this game is ultimatley fun and anyone who hasn't tried it should try it. Another game or two people should try is The Legand of Zelda a Link to the Past, The Legand of Zelda Ocarina of Time, and The Legand of Zelda Majora's Mask. Personally I've beaten all the games listed there."
5,Zelda,"This is one of the best games i have ever played...color gameboy or not. The graphics are pretty good, and the story line is great! You are Link. You have been stranded on a mysterious island. First search the town to get a clue of where to go next, and a mysterious owl guides you with cryptic clues. There are many levels, each with a certain ""dungeon"" to complete. At the end you beat the final level and are shown a way off the island. The game is not limited to the main dungeons there are plenty of other places to explore and things to discover. Help Link defeat all his enemies and set him free. Also a major plus to this game is that it is so well known, that if you ever get stuck, there are hundreds of websites and books with clues and solutions"
5,Lots O' Fun!,"This was one of the best games that I've ever played. I recommend it to anybody who likes adventure! Make sure you don't hit the chickens unless they will attack you, and you can steal from the store, but don't go back unless he'll kill you. Have fun with this one!"
4,I would recommend this game,"I would recommend this game because it has very cool graphics, it's not too hard or too easy. There are alot of different characters. My little brother found the sword, but he couldn't get there because of the 'spiky things' (he's six). This game was one of the best games I've ever played."
4,Zelda,"Zelda DX is one of the most fun RPG's i've ever played for game boy or game boy color. It has a long, twisted, funny, story line in which you save damsles in destress and defeat monsters while tou try to escape from the island."
4,The legend of zelda,"I absolutely love the fact that I received my zelda game very fast and in perfect condition, however, its non-colored when i specifically ordered colored."
3,Fun but Hard,Zelda is a really entertaining game in which you are trying to awake the Wind Fish. You go around to different caves to fight and earn musical instruments. You must collect seven to win the game. I enjoyed the game at the beginning but it gets boring after a while. It is also very hard and I got stuck many times at many different points in the game. I would only reccomend this game to people who want to spend hours trying to find a key to a cave or walking around aimlessly not knowing what you are looking for.
3,"A good Zelda game, but not the best","This is a side story and it is implied that the whole thing is Link's dream. Play this if you're bored, but if not, don't bother, it's not really worth going out of your way for. It is long and occasionally boring. I would suggest Ocarina of time, Link's Awakening, or if you're just looking for GB get Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages."
2,I Really Don't Advise Getting This Product,Do NOT buy any Zelda game for GB. We have the original Links Awakening-BORING. Very challenging gameplay but it is not replayable at all. Pretty lame storyboard (Wind fish?) and easy bosses. The puzzles are kinda hard but the island is big and roomy. Overall a 3 star product-only after you play it once and no more.
5,Greatest Game,"This game is the best. Playing legend of zelda dx kept me playing for hours, even above higher quality games. This game is just plain fun. Eight Dungeons, and a secrect one in the graveyard. Is it worth buying again to see it in color? YES! This is the greatest game boy game ever!"
2,Currently in the trash,"The game arrived early, which was nice. But when I played it, the thing wouldn't save. It played fine, but it's hard to enjoy when you can't save. So I tried to remedy the situation by replacing the battery. However, it just made it worse. So I just decided to take the hit and toss the thing."
5,Amazing Zelda game,"Link's Awakening DX for Game Boy Color is an amazing Zelda game considering it was made with Game Boy technology. The goal of the game is to awaken the Wind Fish which will make this island Link has drifted on vanish. Strange goal, but the game is impressive otherwise. Graphics wise and storyline wise Link's Awakening is very similar to the Super NES Zelda game called Link to the Past. The graphics are almost just as good as the graphics in Link to the Past and this is a worthy Zelda game that is well worth a gamer's time.The game features an owl similar to the one that appears in Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time. Link's Awakening is a huge step in Zelda gaming. It adds to the Zelda game just as much as Link to the Past did. The world in the game is large considering the console is Game Boy. I had a good adventure playing Link's Awakening while just looking at a small Game Boy screen."
5,Great Text and quick delivery,This book arrived very quickly an was in fantastic shape. I'll certainly order again.
4,For School,I had to use this book for school - I liked it. It provided me with the basic information that i needed to know in this field.
4,Forensic Science,Great book for my intro to Forensic Science class..... the professor believes it's currently the best.
5,Very Unique and Talented Production,"I've owned this album since it was first released. And still to this day see it as purely incredible. Simply put, this is by far one of the most unique collaboration of talent. Very dynamic and creative. Lots of changes and heavy used of samples. I like a good dnb song but after a while they all sort of fall into the same rut...same beat, typical bass lines, not a whole lot of innovation going on. But unlike most of those greater club bangers, this project is memorable and will always have a place in my collection for decades to come."
4,Only D&B CD I have,"Maybe it's the only one you need? In any case, even classical fans (like myself) should find this complication thoroughly delicious. Funny, scary, psychedelic... it's all there. My favorite part? The clips of dialog or speech which precede and sometimes end almost every track. Each clip is something fresh and entertaining."
5,It's about time...,"This is a great film, and it's crazy that it hasn't been available on DVD until now. I think it's HH's best work. Now where is 'Trust?'"
1,Pretentious Drivel,"Two brothers go on a road-trip to find their on-the-lam anarchist father and in the process meet an assortment of odd characters.""Simple Men"" is possibly the most pretentious films I have ever seen. I watched this film to the end in the hope of finding something that resembled a plot but was sorely disappointed. All that happened was a bunch of characters, that I cared very little about, said a lot of things that I think were intended to be deep and profound but which I found to be meaningless.This is not my first Hal Hartley film. I had previously seen ""Henry Fool"", which I loved. However, whereas ""Henry Fool"" actually had something to say (and was pretty funny too), ""Simple Men"" is just pretentious drivel. If you must watch one of Hartley's films, watch ""Henry Fool"" instead."
2,Hartley has done much better.,"I might have just been expecting more from this, but I was very disapointed in this movie. It was placed under ""Comedy"" at the video store, and I can't imagine why. Some scenes were funny, but only some. Most of the film was slow, and tried too hard to be romantic. Perhaps I should see it again, but I'm afraid that I'll just end of disliking it even more. Other people really liked it, so perhaps it is just me, and maybe the film really is great. But I personally liked TRUST and AMATEUR, two other Hartley films, much more than this one."
5,"Release all of Hartley's films on DVD, immediately!!","Seriously, I love this movie. This and Trust are my two favorite Hartley movies. I think it's criminal that they are not available on DVD. To me the dialogue is absolutely true (not to mention hysterical) in a completely different way than I've ever seen done by any other filmmaker, plus the deadpan delivery just cracks me up. I can't even really do it justice, you need to see it for yourself. However - be warned, if your idea of a quality flick is one directed by Tom Green, you will not appreciate the subtle charms of this movie. If you have half a brain, however, you should be able to get into Hartley's strange but ultimately satisfying groove.ETA: About frigging time -http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000YEE1W/103-5852099-3885449"
2,Clearly the other two reviews were planted,"I have always been a fan of low budget movies, especially zombie flicks. However, Biophage was a let down. 2 stars is gracious. Acting was almost unbearable and the script at times feels like it was written by an infant. Sound quality in alot of scenes was clearly dubbed and poorly executed (noticable with embarassingly long breaks in dialogue that should have flowed smoothly). I caught myself saying ""who in their right mind would say/do that?"". Its a shame because the plot is unique, and the underlying tension between the doctor and soldier was brilliant, but camera work and directing took this movie from 4 stars to 2. Its worth a watch once so rent it if you love low budget zombie movies, but since I purchased it all I have now is another coaster for the coffee table. Ive never given a movie less than 3 stars, so obviously the other 2 reviews giving this movie 5 stars were planted there by people associated with the movie. Dont be fooled."
3,Maiden's Trip,"This seems to be a first person remniscence, or slightly fictionalized remniscence, of the adventures of a group of Engish high school girls operating a cargo carrying canal boat on the inland waters of England during World War II. There is some interesting history and information on canal boats, a straight forward narrative, and some character development. It is an interesting look at a culture, pre-war England, that was about to undergo drastic change.It is promoted as a YA for girls, I picked it up due to my interest in boats. I believe the author meant it as a simple narrative story, and as such, it stands on it's own. I would recommend Maiden's Trip to anyone old enough to read. It's a good story, and Miss Smith comes across as an interesting person."
4,Good glove,Pros: Look great. Good flexibility (easy to manipulate the bike controls). Block the wind well and are comfortably warm on a 50-60 (F) degree day.Cons: Slightly smaller than I expected. I have only worn these a few times so far and I hope they stretch just a little. I normally would use an L but I think I would get an XL if I had ordered these again.Sidenotes: I havent really gotten them broken in yet so maybe they will stretch to fit. Also I havent been on a long ride (60 minute+) yet with them but they feel comfortable around town.
1,They look cool; I'll give them that.,"Ridiculously thin leather, weak stitching. If you're going to shell out $50 for a pair of leather armored riding gloves, it would be nice to get a pair that might have a reasonable chance of protecting your hands in an accident.These are not that pair of gloves."
4,Sleek Gloves,"I have had these gloves for a few months now and I really love them. Come to find out, my friend also owns a pair of these gloves. His pair are a few years older than mine and he still wears them. They seem be be holding up just fine but the color of the leather has faded quite a bit.I really like the look of these gloves. They are very thin palm side so I don't think think they will support a skid for too long but I suppose they will last just long enough before you skin your hands. The nuckles are lightly padded which is enough to protect you from stones kicked up from other vechiles or drunk flying birds.The only downside to an already excellent glove is that from years prior, the nuckle protection went from very ridgid and firm to soft and bendable. I noticed this when I wore my friends gloves. On a different occation, he made a comment on how soft my gloves padding were to the couple of old pairs he still has. Thus, 4 stars. But, I would recommend this to any serious rider."
2,dont buy,"good material, but hands turn black after wearing gloves. you know how when u wear cheap gloves your whole hand is black afterwards? well thats exactly the case with these."
3,It's alright,"After seeing Seven Samurai, this movie is OK, I was hoping more out of it, but it's OK."
5,Greatness,If you haven't seen these movies you are missing out. Akira Kurosawa was one of the greatest directors of all time. All directors steal from his storys to composition. These are two of his classics.
5,Sterling Prints,Two of Kurosawa's best have been re-released in pristine prints that convey the genius of the director and the richness of his cinematic vision.
4,"absorbing, chilling characterizations, seems true to life","This book pulls you into the story early on, as seemingly separate global events start coming together as chapters progress. The people seem ordinary, even moral, but their actions suggest that they can readily compartmentalize their lives into separate, even dissonant arenas. Unfortunately, it all seems so true to life; I really think the world works more this way and less according to any idealized view of right and wrong. Definitely worth reading. Well-done. I understand it's a first novel by a first-rate author."
5,Great works,"Very easy jazz to listen to. I play it at night to relax. ""You are everything"" takes me back--well years. I went to school with Bill and I always knew he would be a very good song writer. Can't wait until the next CD. Buy the CD you will be glad you did."
4,"Wild and Domestic ""cats""","This movie is one of my 3 year old's favorites. She loves the kittens, and seeing all the other types of wild cats. The thing that my older daughter likes is the song at the end encourages everyone that it's upto all of us to protect wild animals and our planet. It's got greatfootage at Shambala, and a good message."
4,"Good quality, but no features","The transfer quality is nice, and all of the episodes are here. That's likely the best any EWJ fans are going to get, so I've probably won you over with that. Unfortunately there are no special features whatsoever on these discs. That's a little disappointing as even the old VHS releases of two episodes each had a short production feature. Including those four segments on here would seem to be an easy add-on. Really though, the main draw are the funny, eclectic episodes of this unique series, so it's not a big lose."
4,Nice kettle; Color didn't match.,"I bought this kettle in tangerine to match my tangerine kitchenaid mixer, but i was disappointed when i opened the package and found that the color didn't match! The kettle was not as vibrant an orange as the mixer. I ended up returning the kettle, and buying the same one in stainless steel, which i am very happy with. The whistle is not obnoxious like many i have heard, and the spout opener is easy to use and keeps your hands away from the hot steam. The only negative is that because it is such a heavy duty kettle, it takes longer for the water to heat up than in a cheap, lightweight one."
4,Love the color,I love the color of this tea kettle. It arrived quickly. Very happy with the product. Wish the whisle was a little louder though.
3,returned after arrival,"The kettle arrived in a big package, safe and secure.After opening the kettle, I was dismayed to find that the inside was not stainless steel as I expected, but ceramic. Woese still, there are many small dots on the inside surface. I bought this kettle exactly because the kettle I am using had this kind of dots and rusted at these dots. Not a good sign.Another problem is that the kettle handle does not look new.Therefore it went back to Amazon. Want to praise Amazon.com for their customer service, the return process was prompt, painless and costless on my side."
5,Love orange KitchenAid,"I have everything there is in the color that KitchenAid makes. I love it. My kitchen colors are orange, green and yellow. I use this tea pot to make tea about 3 or 4 times a week and it does the job - but mostly it just looks fabulous on my stove."
2,4 month experience with a15-s127,"I bought this due to the cheapest price. The performance of laptop for Matlab, Solidworks and Arena is similar to Pentium 2 733 desktop Pc. I donot suggest you ,if you are planning to use some programs which require more cpu power.It has a severe problem with touchpad or related with pointer. It jumps and destroy what you write. It is not suitable to install more than 10 programs.Network and modem are working properly.Cd writer causes problems sometimes. I have to fix it to write a cd.Appearance : It has a good looking.As a summary, You should pay more to get a better one."
2,"Low price for features, power, space, and good lucks but....","After extensive review I found this Toshiba to be the cheapest way to get the most power in a laptop. It is sleek and the display is great, but good luck if you need tech support! I installed DeLorme's Street Atlas 2003 and Earthmate GPS. It wouldn't run even after I followed all of their trouble-shooting advice. When I called DeLorme they refused to help and told me it was a hardware problem. Toshiba's tech support person was foreign and almost unintelligible. I was not impressed with what I COULD understand. She told me my brand new 2.0 GHz, 256 MB computer with XP Pro ""probably doesn't have enough space on the hard drive to run the program."" When I insisted my laptop met minimum requirements she told me it must be a Windows OS problem! Moral? Dude, I'm getting a Dell!"
5,Great First Laptop!,"I recently purchased this laptop and find it to be a very worthwhile investment as a first laptop for any person. The spacious 30GB of room, excellent video and 256 MB of DDR Memory should be enough for day-to-day duties and for students and office workers on the go. The large screen works and looks great, and the speakers, although not very loud, come through as clear as I've heard on any laptop. The laptop's physical appearance is sleek, with a medium-sized thickness for the body, and nice appearance from the outside. As for cons, the lack of firewire ports, two USB ports, and lack of 'quick-launch' buttons take away from the beauty of it, but for this price, you get more than what you pay for."
1,"Bad Motherboard, bad design","I purchased this laptop 1 year ago next month. It is nothing but trouble. Looks ok, but operates horrible. This is NOT a laptop designed for your lap. It has a sticker on the bottom saying that it will burn bare skin. It gets really hot, really quick. NOt to mention, 3 days ago my motherboard randomly went out. I reasearched this problem and found that MANY Toshiba laptops have this problem. Toshiba will do nothing for you. I've tryed. If you buy this laptop, I PROMISE you you will not be happy after awhile. Pay about $200 more and get a nice IBM."
3,"Excellent narrative, but","The narrative itself is an excellent narrative of the homey aspects of camp life in the Army of the Potomac. It does not specifically address conditions in other Union armies, or those for the Confederates, but within its sphere is a truly excellent work.I'd give the *print* version 5 stars. However, the Kindle version is missing all the line drawings and chapter headings that give the original book such charm. With some books that wouldn't matter so much - with this one, you're easily losing half the value of the book, so three it is."
5,Best Book and a Must (Want to Equip with Knowledge),This the best book on sports nutrition I have read so far. this book is for those who want to equip themselves with knowledge and get the best out of their physique.This book has amazing section....it tells us what to eat ...when to eat.....how to eat (recipes)...tells you which latest supplements that work and without promoting any brand......the book seems to be clean as it seems not to have funded by any supplement manufacturer...It is a must for those who have partial or no knowledge about nutrition.....It is a also good learning once again for those who have very good knowledge....Amazing and a must.....
2,Nothing New.,"I had high hopes for this book having something new to offer. I've read a lot of books on the subject and found nothing new that can't be found on the internet for free. The author is also from Europe and her constant reference to kg vs. lbs. is somewhat annoying. Not her fault mind you, just annoying for American readers.I am not saying that the author's book is bad, just the same old information that's been around for years. If you're serious about sports nutrition I suggest you read Sports & Exercise Nutrition by William D. McArdle. Its a college textbook that offers a strong insight into nutrition.Some may find the book too technical, but how else can you understand the science behind such a scientific topic.Good luck."
4,Just good comedy,"This show has some very good talent and obviously even better writers, I don't see this show getting old and tired."
1,Original artist! 40 years later on a karaoke machine!,"Until the original Cameo/Parkway label masters come out of legal deadlock, the best we'll get are substandard re-recordings like these."
1,This disk is DEFECTIVE-- it will not play. Sob Sob Sob.,Neither I nor the person to whom I gave the CD as a gift can get the disc to play on ANY device available to us. HUGELY DISAPPOINTED.
1,Worthless Screen Door,One is still in its packaging - the other that was used temporarily is in the trash. The velcro that was sent didn't work and the seller never replied to me - I had a buy velcro that cost as much as the door.
1,wrong item sent by vendor! not as pictured on amazon.,product ordered not product received in mail. had purchased before from another vendor. couldn't believe the hardware required to install! nothing good to say about this purchase experience. product thrown out!
1,Dont believe what you read,"I bought this because I live in a rental place thinking I wouldnt need to drill or screw anything into the doorwall because the product states ""Simple to install NO TOOLS !. Well to my surprise thats the first thing they ask you to do. The screen itself does not line up with the door they say it fits any door up to 36 inches and my door measured 35 inches. I measured it purposely to make sure it would fit before purchasing it. The gaps that remain around the door would let every insect in bringing me to the third misleading thing about this product. ""It keeps out insects and other pests"". Pretty hard to hold up to that claim when you have gaps all the way around the door. Very misleading represenation of this product. Save yourself the hassle and go with something different."
3,More like a folding screen door,"The product is not exactly what the picture looks like. The product is more consistent with those pop up mesh laundry baskets, the screen is not as see through as the picture and the frame is not a solid piece as the picture shows.This was a good temporary screen door, it allowed me to keep the door open and most bugs out but I had to tape it to the door frame.Over all I would say this is a good product but don't expect it to work the same as the picture shows."
3,pop up screen door,"I thought the new design for the instant screen door would be an improvement. My las one was a hanging screen and it curled, letting in the bugs. This one was only slightly improved. The support pieces that are located near the handle do ot stay in place, therefore, it does not close all the time!!!! As the time goes on, the brace comes off more and more. Maybe I should glue it in place!!!!!!INSTANT POP UP SCREEN DOOR"
3,You get what you pay for,"The screen came bent so when I put it up the screen wouldn't stay straight or flat. It curled up on one side. After manipulating the wire edge, it did straighten out a little bit. I purchased this because I live in an apartment and cannot install a real screen door. I love to cook so I need the front door open and to circulate the air. However, that also means bugs and flies come in too. The instant screen served it's purpose of keeping the bugs out. You can easily take it down and put it away since it's not very eye pleasing."
3,Not Goldsworthy's best work,"This book is somewhat scholarly and therefore, dry. He is not very clear on what he is trying to convey to the reader. However, the author does raise a few interesting insights into ancient warfare. His latest work: Cannae is much better. He expands on his thesis of the conditions in ancient warfare which is quite interesting. He manages to get into the psyche of the ancient soldier. However, in the Roman Army at War, he does not deliver."
3,Very Good and Iconoclastic,"There is a large literature on the Roman Army. As Goldsworthy points out, much of it is flawed by an idealized view of Roman soldiery and anachronistic interpretations. Inspired somewhat by Keegan's pioneering ""The Face of Battle"", Goldsworthy sets out to review the evidence critically in an effort to reconstruct how the Roman Army was organized and was the experience of service for both commanders and rankers. His use of sources is excellent and he is very careful not to over interpret the data. This work is based clearly on an excellent knowledge of Roman history. Interested readers should be aware that this is specialist monograph, written with an audience of scholars in mind. To understand the text fully you need a good basic knowledge of Roman history. Acquaintance with prior works on the Roman army is very helpful."
4,Jim Crow: A New Reality,C. Vann Woodward challenges long-held beliefs about 'Jim Crow' which will astonish Americans today. Northerners will be surprised by having to own up to prejudices quieter but more pervasive than encountered in the south.Robert SwainNew York City
3,Somewhat Disappointing,Professor C Vann Woodward was a great historian according to what I have read. Unfortunately for me this book was unclear at times. Instead of a narrative I would have preferred a chronology of events.
1,"Product color rubs off, leaving dark gray powder on hands, and anything white","This paint has some kind of metal leaf within it, that causes a dark gray powdery color to rub off whenever it is touched. I painted a large lateral file cabinet with it, and now need to redo the entire thing, since it was intended to hold archival white art boards. While the company has offered to repay me for the cost of the paint, it took 4 man days to paint the cabinet, and 3 for it to dry, and now I will need to redo everything. Very poor product."
5,supermodels,"i love that song, i first heard it on the wb show called popular, and i loved the show even more because of the song. i love the lyrics : ""i'm just tired of being compared"" it's very appropriate for the media images society is inflicted with. buy the cd, you will not regret it."
5,Excellent,"Where has this lady been hiding,,we want more of you Kendall.. Definetly one of the cd's I listen to most.."
5,Kendall is amazingly talented in her writing and singing.,"This CD is amazing. There is such a sincere honesty in her lyrics and a diverse range in her voice, which was even evident a couple years back when she was 16 and I saw her perform for the first time. 'Supermodels' is a big hit with me as well as 'On My Bones', and 'Formerly Known As'."
4,An incredibly solid first effort.,"This is one of the best freshman efforts I've heard from a female artist in a long time. When I first heard Kendall live at Lilith Fair I was immeadiately hooked, and the album has not been a disappointment. Most of the songs come flying off the CD with exceptional guitar riffs and Payne's voice cutting through it all with unexpected power. My biggest critisism of the album is that stylistically Payne is all over the place. Depending upon the track she can resemble any number of artists: Jewel, Sinead o'Connor, Shawn Colvin, or Alannis Morrisette to name a few; she hasn't come into her own style yet on the album. It's obvious from her live performances that she's gained a great deal of musical maturity from the artists of Lilith Fair, and I anxiously await a second album where she can showcase that growth. Until that time enjoy this album and don't miss a chance to see her live."
5,A good Payne,"This is a great album. It is has individuality and talent. You really feel you get to know the artist when listing to her songs. She shows passion and feeling it each song, giving very creative vibes and vocal arrangements. It is almost as though she is putting part of herself in each song. A woman that shows power and strength is always high on my list."
2,Hold out for a better design.,We find this kettle to be lacking in several departments. The handle gets too hot on a gas burner. On an electric burner it does stay cool. The whistle indicating the water is hot is nothing special. The pour spout trigger doesn't always hold the spout open. The pot has been slippery. If you do like this I would hold out for the Stainless steel version so you don't have to worry about cracking the porcelin.
3,Love the Color,This terra cotta colored tea kettle is very pretty. It is a little difficult to fill it up with water because of the odd design of the pouring spout. It does not open all the way and requires you to tilt it almost all the way up to fill it. I liked my Chantal better but it almost cost me twice the money!
1,rusty kettle,I bought this tea kettle thinking kitchenaid would be a reliable brand. Granted I bought this kettle back in September but recently I found rust spots on the inside of the kettle. We've stopped using it and I wonder how long its been there. Do not buy this kettle?? What good is a kettle if you end up with rust in your water!!
4,Well made costume,"This costume was well made for the money. Just a warning, the sizing ran very big."
2,DISAPPOINTED,I finished this game in 3 days. I never want to play it again. Bugs can do barely anything in his defense and there are a ton of annoying passwords to write down. There are actually 61 levels and the treasure Bugs does all this for is just Lola Rabbit!
1,NEVER BUY THIS!!!OR RENT IT OR ANYTHING!,"This game is [not good] such a RIP!!!! You don't know that enemys are falling on you. You CAN'T move when falling, there aren't ANY options. If I had a choice i'd give this a 0 star rate!! There are so many doors that you don't know where to go. There are also too many shortcuts, Sometimes- too many pipes. You WILL get confused. unless your really want to, dont buy..."
4,On Behalf of my Kids,"My kids (4 yr old boy & 6 yr old girl) love this game. The 4 yr old can play it, and actually get to the next level. My 6 yr old gets into the double digit levels, but my wife (mommy) observed that they both started talking about killing things, which are obstacles in the game. They drop stuff on Daffy Duck, blow up Elmer Fudd, and dispose of them to advance. This could be the only negative about this game. It is also very absorbing. A good value for your Gameboy Color."
5,Great kettle!,I bought this kettle and am very happy with the way it works and looks! The water boils fast and water level is seen very clearly. I bought this kettle on sale but would pay full price for it -- my previous experience with cheaper brands were not good.
5,Perfect!,"I bought this kettle after a trip to Scotland. They have one in every B&B and hotel room for tea. I love the rapid boil and the locking top (no spills!) Perfect for tea, hot cocoa, boiling water for cooking anything! I'm sending one to my mother and Grandmother. Well worth the money, you will find many uses for it."
1,Why the British Empire collapsed,"Reading James' book RAJ gives one a much clearer impression of why the UK was eclipsed in the 20th century: no sense of distance or perspective. This book is an okay introduction to a basic history of the English conquest of the Subcontinent; as far as anything approaching history from an unbiased perspective, it falls far short. Snippy remarks about Gandhi, entirely too much editorialization about Mountbatten, and a surreal disregard for the people who inhabited what has become India pervade and nearly ruin this book. While those whose country was colonized will understandably present an entirely different portrait of this century-plus of history, this is the exact opposite: an almost jingoistic portrayal of the Raj and the ""civilizing"" mission of the English in India. I cannot recommend this book to anyone who does not take what they read with a large dose of suspicion."
1,A disservice to history,The author would belong well with the 19th century British historians who manipulated historical events to create their own version of history. I threw the book down after sampling a few pages. Bravery displayed in war by Indian is labeled as 'reckless spirit' while bravery displayed by British soldiers is labeled as 'pluck'. He should rename the book 'A few hundred pages of nonsense'
4,A Needed and Well-Written Review of Britain's Raj,"This book is a fascinating look at British India, from the days of Robert Clive to Viceroy Mountbatten. Lawrence James has once again shown his remarkable talent for writing British, especially Imperial, history. I highly recommend both this book and Lawrence James' ""Rise and Fall of the British Empire."" ""The Making and Unmaking of British India"" is a book I waited for months to buy and I was not disappointed. Anyone who is fascinated by the British Empire, particularly India, will want to read this book. It profiles political, military, and cultural events in Indian colonial history and, while recognizing the problems of the colonial regime, also brings the positive qualities of British rule to light."
2,This book is good if you have insomnia.......,".... because it reads like a dictionary. I suppose you could buy it as a reference, but it's way too long and dry to be readable. If you want to read a book that really gives you the flavor of British Empire, look elsewhere."
3,A perfect sample of biased story telling,"A well written book on a subject rarely covered by historians, James' book falls short on one very important account: objectivity. His narrative on the Raj is rife with prejudice. He certainly pays homage to political correctness by throwing in a few bones of anti-imperialist sentiment in England; however, the gist of his tale is that the British conquest was a godsend for the impoverished and downtrodden masses of India. He claims the resistance of early rebels was motivated by a desire to maintain their tyranical authority, while the actions of latter-day leaders (e.g., Gandhi) were motivated by English-taught desires for democratic independence. He only vaguely alludes to the possibility that the Indians did not want to be conquered by a foreign power and were motivated by patriotism independent of British influence.Again, The Raj is a well-written book on an interesting topic, but readers should keep keenly in mind it is far from a objective narrative."
4,"good album, but too short","If you like Agent Steel then you'll like Rival. This band has definatly studied their metal, and have released an album full of great riffs and solos. the only complaints that someone can make are in the album length (only 35 minutes) and the vocals aren't as powerful as I would like. The vocals are good their just not great, they remind me very much of Bruce Hall(Agent Steel) without the Halford like falsetto and the polish. but all in all a very good metal album definatly worth a listen."
4,Rival,Surprisingly good CD by an unknown I found on ebay. The songs are crisp and different enough to make the CD unique. This one won't be your all time favorite but I find myself going back to it frequently. The singer has a bit of a strange accent but his range is good and the guitar leads are sharp.
2,Disappointing Text Messenger,"This product is easy to use and comes with very basic directions. But the text messenging feature does not deliver. In order to send a message the other person needs to be within 10 feet and have their handheld on ""receive"" mode waiting for the message. The address book and scheduling features are fine as data banks but the text messaging feature was very disappointing to my 6, 8 and 9 year old kids."
2,Too complicated,These text messengers are way too complecated. The messages routinely don't go through. Even when following the directions exactly many of the functions don't work correctly. I couldn't even get the time and date to reset correctly. Definitely don't waste your money.
1,Not impress with Wireless Text Msg,"My son was looking forward to get ""pager"" to play with so he can text msg with his sister while playing around the house separately or outside but the book said it has to be front of each other. He wasnt too happy so we took it back."
1,Worst product I have seen in a very long time,"It has been many, many years since I purchased a product that simply did not work. After struggling for over an hour with trying to send a message I finally gave up. A quick Internet search found dozens of complaints about this toy. I don't know if my purchase was defective or if the product and documentation are just so horrible that I gave up.Do not buy this toy."
3,It works,"Pros It works. This is a one size fits lots of GM cars.Cons It has a foam Gasket instead of the nice rubber one that comes with the OEM. You can reuse the OEM Gasket. The connection was a little different than the OEM but it works. When the fan is running on high it shakes the whole dashboard and steering wheel. I don't believe that its out of balance but has more to do with the way its made. When it was outside of the car and you turn by hand at low speeds it felt rough. I picked this one up online, had it been local I would have return it and pop for one that was little better made."
3,...,slightly unbalanced wheel which makes some noise but was not expensive and works as promised. good for car with 160000
5,TOTALLY AWSOME!,I love the Muppets! My favorite song is Celebration by the Alien Gonzos. Any Muppet fan has to get this CD.
5,A Funky Good Time,"This is one of my favorite soundtracks ever, because it's just so darned fun! Collected here is some of the best funk music around. A real highlight is the duet with George Clinton and Pepe! But don't get me wrong, the Muppets themselves only appear on 3 songs, the rest are preformed by humans. The only track I don't listen to is the last one, a remix of the classic Gonzo song, ""I'm Going To Go Back There Someday"". Why they felt the need to remix this song I'll never understand, but at least it's at the end and eaisly skipped over. I play this soundtrack when I workout and it never fails to get me through it with a smile on my face. I've even played it at a party once and not only did it get everyone dancing, but no one could believe it was a Muppet soundtrack! I thnk a few even bought themselves a copy.This is a perfect CD for any age and especially if you're ready to have a funky good time! Buy it now."
5,This soundtrack is a wonderful new venture for the Muppets!,"This amazing CD is a perfect accompaniment to the fantastic movie. Pepe is hilarious with George Clinton singing ""Flashlight"" and the Alien Gonzos are irresistible in their version of ""Celebration"". This is the first time a Muppet movie has had music that was already written, and it really works. This is a must for any Muppet fan."
2,False advertising...,"A mad scientist performs brain surgery on gorillas to control their minds (with the usual aim of world domination) and a unlikeable mercenary enlists the help of a jungle girl to stop him. That's it, no Kong, no Island. Talk about false advertising :-) This is a substandard Eurotrash effort, graced by atricious acting by muscleman Brad Harris (who did quite a few sandal-films earlier) and a completely ridiculous plot. It's not bad enough to be really entertaining so unless you have to see every Italian junk film - save your money. The Retromedia disc is not really packed with extras - although an ""uncut European version"", with includes some brief nudity is supplied, however, this uncut version was obviously taken directly from a Greek videotape, including the subtitles."
2,Rating Based on Five Minutes,"But those five minutes told me all I need to know. First, the movie opened with a jeep driving along a beach or a desert or something. First sign of trouble: rather than spend real money having the name of the company painted on the door of the jeep, a piece of cardboard under the windshield says EAST AFRICA TRADING COMPANY. So we know we are in Africa and not in...say...Italy. A gunfight ensues. Most of the casualties drop without so much as a spot of blood (more economy). Cut to a gratuitous underwear scene.This movie was part of the 50 Sci Fi Movie Collection, which has a lot of stuff better than this but this isn't THAT bad. I will probably watch the whole thing."
3,Muscles and Monkeys,"There is not much to this film.... but to see Brad Harris take off his shirt to reveal one of the most awesome set of muscles on film, its worth getting! Woof!!"
4,"Fun, original break from reality","Loved this book; it's pure brain candy! The characters are vivid and surreal, which adds to the book's appeal.Fetch a glass of iced tea, settle into your recliner, and escape the workaday world with 'Stray Not Beyond.'Within minutes, you will forget your worries as Carslile enounters a kaliedoscope of hilarious characters."
4,Realistic view on our history,"I was impressed by historic quality of this DVD. The timeline is precise and the story values the truth as much as possibly could be achieved. The holocaust is terrible part of our history, but must never be forgotten. Furthermore is a good thing to see how world democarcy has been preserved, people died for a simple thing called freedom. It should be mandatory to watch for everyone! A guy from the Netherlands"
3,Faulty DVDs,"Unfortuantely, the DVDs I received are faulty. The captions are locked on. No attempt at turing them off through the main menu will shut them off."
5,Great continuing story,"Ends the story. Great. Now you can buy the whole set, starting with Winds of War."
5,"War & Remembrance - Vol. 2, The Final Chapter: Parts 8 - 12",***** 5 Star production and a must see.... you will never forget the images of what actually happened during a dark time in world history.
5,"War and Remembrance, final chapters","The casting is superb, especially Polly Bergen as Rhoda. All the actors shine and I appreciated the no-holds-barred scenes of the Nazis as they did horrific crimes against the Jews. The quality of the production is so great, it makes me regret that no TV mini-series will ever come close."
3,"War & Remembrance, Vol. 1 & 2. Very good but not as good as the original Winds of War. Too much Auchwitz.","Very good but not as good as the original (Winds of War). There was so much Auchwitz, it was very hard to watch."
3,WAR AND REMEMBRANCE PART I,"I suppose historically this is a good mini-series but it is very soap opera-ish and very long and drawn out. I bought it for my mother who enjoyed this whole mini-series and she does love it, but I think the series might be longer than WWII actually was!"
5,Student of Y K Kim,"As a TaeKwonDo student of Grandmaster Y K Kim, this text is required reading, not so that he can gain royalties, but that his entire philosophy for the techniques of life is contained within. From the definition of a healthy life to meditation to movement to stretching to TaeKwonDo, it's all here, and explained in a very easily-understood format. Please read this book. You will never regret it!!"
4,Morgan,"Jack Morgan is a man who lives in perpetual crisis, a microcosm of the twentieth century whose astonishing vitality electrifies the pages of this novel."
5,Another Captain Underpants Novel,"Captain Underpants is a great epic novel series by Dav Pilkey.With his new book Captain Underpants and the Attack of the Talking toilets we discover his power against talking, eating, mad toilets. He uses cafeteria food and his underware.This book also has more flip-o-ramas than ever.The flip-o-ramas are filled with even more juicy underware fighting.Captain Underpants beats the talking toilets with underware and his extreme power.George and Harold,the main characters,try to help Captain Underpants but just stir up more trouble.Captain Underpants not only has to worry about the evil talking toilets but also freeing George and Harold.Captain Underpants ended up winning the battle and freed George and Harold.Over all,Captain Underpants is an awesome fighter and awesome warrior."
4,Captain Underpants,"Captain Underpants And The Attacks Of The Talking Toilets is an awesome book, like the rest of Dave Pilkey&#65533;s books are. It&#65533;s about these two kids that get in trouble with all the teachers. Then something bad happens. In this case it is the talking toilets which want to take over the world!I think it is awesome that Harold and George go and make comic books about Captain Underpants. Then, they photo copy the comic book with this kid&#65533;s copy machine that makes pictures come alive. Read the book and find out the rest."
5,this book rocks,Once i started reading i could not stop try it out.This book is awsome by Dav Pilkey its about two kids name goerge and harold there trouble makers but at a piont of the book the need help and the person to do it is captain underpants.There are toilets going wild eating up the teachers.But soon after that Captain Underpants comes and helps.BUT CAPTAIN UNDERPANTS WAS DOING GOOD UNTIL THE BIG TALKING TOILET came and ate up captain underpants.all of these talking toilets came in the first place because of harold and goerge every thing in there comic came to life.Buy the book to find out the rest.
3,its ok,As soon as we got this book we opened it up and pages fell out of the book! My son loves this book though just wish it was put together a little better.
5,Captian Underpants and the Attack of the Talking Toilets,I admit that the title is a little off putting but any book that can get reluctant readers to pick it up gets a A+ in my book. Not a great work of literature obviously but kids love it and it gets them reading. That is the important thing!
2,"SMALL PRINT, ITS ALMOST LIKE READING A DICTIONARY","The words are too small to read., with black and white cartoon pictures..The book is only good for knowing what you want and finding it in the index.. i recommend the Better Homes New cook Book..."
5,A Males Cookbook,"The Book is great for new Cooks like Newly Weds or Young Men learning about cooking. It has it all. Like how to grill. The things men do wrong when grilling the way thier fathers would teach them like, salting your meat prior to grilling. Great pointers as in why Red potatoes are better for boiling than Idaho. Even a reciepe for Hush Puppies. How to cut a Wedding cake and a menu for a New Years party. I tell everyone I know this is the best cookbook you will ever find and its easy to understand. Most books I give up reading after the I have to go to the far east to find the ingredients. I will always... have this book. If you did not learn it all from your mother, and she is not just a phone call away, then you can almost always find the advice you need in this book. It is written in easy to understand verbage and I love it."
3,"Nice collection, crummy paper","The book is a delightful collection and no kitchen should be without it. However, The pages are of poor quality paper and the printing is similar to photocopy quality. The spiral bound is even worse, being printed on paper similar to newsprint. I think I would have been happy to pay a bit more for better quality materials in this book. I saw the hardbound book at a local store and didn't think is was much better."
4,Cookbook review,I bought this as a gift for my new daughter-in-law. Just like the one I have. Came in great condition. Perfect.
1,Joy of Cooking CD-ROM,"We wish we had gotten the book instead. We were taken in by the menu planning and shopping list features listed on the box. They are very difficult to use and we probably won't bother learning to use it. Maybe we'll print out a recipe occasionally, but a new copy of the book would have been a better choice."
2,disappointing,"This book is fine if you're in the habit of cooking roast beef dinners with all the trimmings. It has some good old-fashioned information but given the size of this book (big enough to kill someone if dropped on the head) it's disappointing. The muffin recipes have way too much sugar for the amount of flour required, the cookie recipes are not good, and if you're Italian, you will have a good laugh at the pasta recipes."
1,Bad Choice for CD Rom Cook Book,"Overall a bad choice for a PC based cook book. I ordered this book specifically for the CD Rom. I have an older copy of the cook book and didn't really need another copy. The CD Rom is not for the faint hearted. It is very difficult to use. It requires you to insert to CD Rom every time you use it. It takes control of the pc--i.e., you don't have use of the Start Menu Bar to transfer to different software programs; and the exiting of the program takes ""forever"". I had hoped to use the ""Add your own recipe section"", but this again is too time consumming to use."
1,Software is terrible,"I am absolutely disgusted with the Joy of Cooking CDROM. It is a terribly designed piece of software. The content is good (it is the Joy of Cooking after all). However the graphical interface renders the software useless. If you aren't VERY comfortable using computers, don't even bother trying to use this software. It will make you want to throw your computer out the window. Why the authors ever agreed to tarnish their names and the name of Joy of Cooking by associating it with this software I will never know. Simon & Schuster should have never let software of such a poor quality be sold."
5,Does this book have sewn binding?,"My old 1975 copy has sewn binding, does this one?--or is it glued? I'd like to buy a new one.The give the book 5 stars because I know the content is good, since I already have it. I am assuming it has sewn binding..Please comment if you don't mind; I'd like to know."
1,"The Spiral Edition ins't inexpensive, it's cheap!","Joy of Cooking is a wonderful resource in the hardback edition, especially the version updated with a new copyright in 1997 with Ethan Becker added as an editor. The new hardback, though expensive, is worth every penny and then some."
3,Joy of Cooking (spiral bound),No problem with the content. The very thin paper and minute print hinder the pleasure of using this book.
5,DICTIONARY OF COOKING,"IF ONE WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT FOOD, HERE IS THE BOOK TO USE....MORE ABOUT INGREDIENTS THAN ABOUT RECEPIES. i HAVE HAD ""JOY OF COOKING"" FOR MANY YEARS IN PAPERBACK AND IT SPLIT IN 3 PIECES. I AM NOW THE PROUD OWNER OF THIS NEWER EDITION IN HARDBACK. I USE IT ALONG WTH OTHER RECEPIES.."
5,the one cookbook everyone should own.,We bought for our son for Christmas. This book is the textbook on cooking. It explains why you do things to prepare food from a scientific standpoint. There a numerous sections on every type of food and examples of nearly every dish prepared in western Euro-American cooking.
5,oh joy!,"I have been cooking and baking using the Joy of Cooking for nearly 40 years. This has many advantages over modern specialty cookbooks, it has tables of conversion, substitution and much more. Lots of classic, wonderful recipes. Highly recommended for beginner and advanced bakers and cooks."
4,Don't throw away!,"Just a quick word, in case you buy the ""new version"", this one has recipes (quick hollandaise), that the ""new"" joy of cooking doesn't have! This one's a keeper too!"
1,the joy of cooking,the cookbook is great. i bought it for my daughter but the book was very dirty. some of the receipes had a lot of food on it. i sent the book back. will buy another from someone else.
1,YUCK!!!,"If you want bad gourmet recipes, then this is your book. The basic information is poor at best, and the ""fancy"" gourmet recipes are not even good. When I begin to cook a meal, i'll look in the ""joy of cooking"", get disappointed, and go and find what I want on the internet. The recipes are what you would expect to eat in the early 20th century. This book should have stayed there. I'm sure your grandma loves it though! squid in ink sauce?! for real? c'mon!"
1,Has been,"Found recipes dated, layout makes it difficult to use and although some of the how-to is useful, its generally from another era. Bought Gourmet cook book instead."
5,The best book with which to start and finish cooking!,"I remember my mother's ""essential"" cook books and I always appreciated that they took nothing for granted in their expectations of what you knew about cooking! I was so please with my discovery of ""The Joy of Cooking""! My family cooks a lot of food from a variety of cultural backgrounds (we are a multicultural family) but every so often you draw a blank on some of the most common or essential elements of North American cooking. This book will get you through! I also like all the background information about ingredients (are the authors closet chemists?) and the susbtitution tables. This book fills in all the in-betweens that lack from most cookbooks. Speaking as a person who is not a cook but that thoroughly enjoys food I gotta say this is the best book I have encountered for both making an approach and successfully carrying through a cooking project. (Gosh! By the sounds of my review these folks should be canonized!)"
4,Still Useful,"I got my first JOY when I moved into my first apartment, but I'd been using my mother's older copy for several years before that. I agree that this new edition (which is now my third) is missing some of the old-timey stuff found in the older ones, but the new recipes and reference material make up for that lack. Overall, I think that I'll keep all my copies, and use them as one might use an evolving set of reference encyclopedias - the newer versions have new discoveries and knowledge, while the old ones have little-known but useful tips. By the way, if you haven't tried the recipe for banana pudding, do so - I made it for a large dinner party, doubling the recipe without a hitch, and it was all we could do to keep some guests from just eating it spoonful by spoonful directly out of the bowl...yum."
5,Still A Classic,"My mom gave me this cookbook with an inscription: ""If you can read, you can cook"". Every new household needs this book and the same inscription.A few years later, I gave mom a new VCR. I hooked it up but left the flashing ""12:00"" and didn't program in any of the stations. I handed her the instruction booklet and said ""If you can read, you can operate it"". Half an hour later, the VCR was fully programmed.Amazing how reading the recipe/instructions helps!"
3,"How to, great! Recipes, not so great...","I've had this book for a number of years. I've found that I refer to it mostly to read on the hows and whys of food, cooking and preparation, rather than the recipes that are within. As another reviewer stated (however unkindly she did it) the recipes are very dated. I suppose newer editions of this book include more modern versions, but I have plenty other cookbooks and the net to satisfy that need."
4,Joy of Cooking,"First knew of this book from the movie Julie and Julia in 2009. Was more interested in Julia Child's book, but 2 years later, I found this and I'm so pleased! Have not gone thru it but received it in good condition. Thanks!"
4,Handy Kitchen Bible,"Any kitchen questions are answered in this best-selling cookbook, and I deliberately purchased the spiral-bound edition, for easier reference. I had a paperback version for over 20 years, and it began to come apart at the seams, literally. Throughout my adult life, the one cook book that has stayed with me is The Joy of Cooking."
5,The best cookbook ever,This is the best cookbook ever! I grew up with it. My mom used it and I lost the book after she passed away during a move. Now I have the same version she had. I love it!!
5,Essential to any kitchen,"I've worn out several copies of several editions of Joy of Cooking over the years. This is THE basic cook book, the perfect gift for a newlywed, or a newly single guy. The best part about this book is that it tells you how to do everything - from the simplest roast to elaborate sauces. I have nothing but good things to say about Joy of Cooking."
3,book smaller format than expected,"I ordered this book for a friend, as I have the same cookbook spiral bound and love it. I was surprised and disappointed to find out that it was printed with pages that are 2/3 the size of mine, so smaller print, harder to read."
5,A Must-Have for any serious aspirant to the Art of Cooking.,"After the Boston Cooking School CookBook, this was my second. I've had it for over 30 years and still use it. It's a virtual encyclopedia of cooking everything from soup to nuts. No kitchen should be without it."
2,hurts my eyes,"The recipes are fine, but the format is irksome. I much prefer the ring-binder with tabs cookbooks to this one, which I recieved as a gift. The other irritating aspects of the book are:* small font* thin, flimsy pages (Think newsprint or coffee filter absorbancy.)* instructions interspersed with the ingredients (I prefer to see them listed first, followed by instructions.)* drawings only (In this technologically advanced day and age, you'd expect photographs at the very least, and maybe even some color -- but not with JOC.)* no tabsDid I mention there are no tabs in this book which has many, Many, MANY pages? To find a recipe or section you must either use the table of contents/index or else flounder around until you find it.This book makes me tired and cranky and I find that I am very averse to using it, not because the recipes are bad, but because of the format."
2,Not a good general cookbook for the novice,"I am by no means an expert or even experienced cook, but I am also by no means an idiot. I have had this book for several years and have used it often. It is full of good reference material and some very good recipes.But I have also found that it is often far too un-necessarily complicated. I have also tried several receipes that simply didn't work. Like I said, I'm not an idiot, I followed all the directions carefully, but still...I think maybe if I knew more about cooking then I could figure what went wrong and what to do correctly, but I don't think a cookbook should be trial-and-error exorcise."
2,Reading comfort of the local phone book,"I bought this book a result of a reference while looking at other cookbooks. But I do not think it is a really big addition to my library of cookbooks. In the first place nobody mentioned that it is a book without any fotos, just small tiny drawings to illustrate cooking steps. And I really think that cooking books a lot more inspiring with nice pictures. And on the second hand nobody neither commented on the book's very small printing on poor paper. You really get the impression that you are looking something up in a phone book. Because of the two mentioned reasons I really did not concentrate a lot on the recipes. Maybe that the book might be helpful if you are looking for some recipe someone mentioned or you just remembered using it as a kind of encyclopedia. But it is definitely not the right book for lightening up your daily brainstorming about what to cook for your family."
2,A little disappointing,"The product took a little longer to arrive which made me worry at first. Then it had stated ""hard cover"" which it definately isn't. It was a little more worn that what I thought it had been discribed as also. And the book just wasn't what I had expected which isn't really no ones fault. I thought it would have more recipes in it - i.e. meat recipes, etc...."
2,Not for Everyday,"This book is great if you're a gourmet. If you're just a plain old mom (or plain old anybody), it's not so good. Most of the recipes require too many ingredients, odd/gourmet ingredients, and far too much preparation time for those of us with busy lives who don't love to spend all our spare time cooking. I much prefer a more down-to-earth cookbook which uses fewer ingredients per recipe, more ""standard"" ingredients - the things we almost all keep our refrigerators and pantries stocked with (think Cheddar cheese instead of Gruyere) - and which doesn't expect me to spend all evening in the kitchen. Mark Bittman's How to Cook Everything is much better in this respect."
1,Chowderific....................do you copy?,"So far zero response so in actuality Chowderific earns ZERO stars.The story so far:On August 11, 2010 my account was charged and ""Joy of Cooking"" was shipped from Chowderific with an estimated delivery window ending September 2, 2010. On the 3rd of September I politely emailed them via Amazon regarding the missing merchandise. No response. Today is the 8th and still no response so I just fired off another (futile?) e-mail. I saw their ratings and thought something like this wouldn't happen but here I am. I plan to update this review later but as of now my advice is purchase at your own risk and don't say I didn't warn you.PS. You can't go wrong with this edition it's been in the family for years but my mother wisely will not give her copy up.Update as of September 9, 2010: a representative from shipping has contacted me and is sending out another copy with a tracking number this time. I should have it in 8 business days."
5,Snowchains for the occasional user...,"I purchased these chains for the once or twice a year I travel to Colorado for skiing. I drive a full size 2 wheel drive pickup and these chains really provide the bite necessary for traversing the passes in the packed snow and ice. Rest at ease if you don't have 4 wheel drive... these chains are the ticket! Also, the cam-lock variety makes it easy to properly tension the chains, HIGHLY recommended!"
2,Not heavy chain,"Chain wasn't heavy enough, heavy duty does not mean heavy duty chain. If you are looking for heavy chains like used on duals on semi's then look somewhere else."
4,Fit like a glove,"Chains fit standard Toyota FJ Cruiser tires as expected. EZ to install. Minimal extra linkage. Box that the chains came in could be bigger to make it easier to get back in the box. As cheap as the rubber chain tensioners are, it would have been a bonus if the tensioners could have been included with the chains as part of the chain set."
2,Wrong Size,"It seems to me that the specs. on the 01 tundra are wrong. The width of the chain is right but, I need to take a foot out of the chain to make it fit. This needs to be fixed. I would have preferred a choice on using vehicle information or tire size."
2,Product seems to been used..,"I ordered this chain set new. However, it seems to me that this was a used product and has been repackaged. I saw signs of rust on most of the links, but I ended up using it anyway just because of the major snow storm we had a week ago. Amazon should have checked their products before shipping it out."
1,It just never comes,"They seem to be much more interested in sending everything BUT the magazine. I got maybe two issues but I got a boat-load of contest entries etc. etc. It you want to read it, go see your dentist and you can catch up on People mag too."
5,Great quick read!,"While each issue is packed with ads, the content more than makes up for it! I look forward to finding it in my mailbox."
1,kindl readers digest and other concerns,"Magazine subscriptions blog from MagMall.comSo I've been having the readers digest for sometime on the kindle, and I am going to discontinue. One of the reasons I got a kindle was because it was advertised that books would be only 9.99, and now the books are getting more and more expensive. A regular reader's digest is 10,- a year but with the kindle subscription I pay 15.- a year, and I don't even get to see all the pictures which are in the real reader's digest version. So I am charged more for less and am punished for being environmentally friendly, which is what I gave up my hard copies of my beloved books for. I think not. I'll go back to my hardcovers and scrap the electric kindle, which not is starting to cost me more in books, and also eats electricity."
3,Much Better Deal,I have subscribed to the Digest for years but their price is somewhat higher for a magazine that is no longer published 12 months per year and has more ads and disclaimers than in previous years. Sometimes I wonder why I subscribe at all.
3,not as good,Years ago I used to read Readers Digest and its no where as good as it used to be. I have been giving it away to a friend.
1,"Too many ads, not enough substance","This publication isn't what it used to be. I am 32 years old and for my entire (yes entire) life my family has subscribed to the Reader's Digest. It is the perfect ahem... restroom reading material because it contains short, well written stories that are either amusing, thought provoking, heart warming (or a combination of all three).Now, every other page - literally - is an advertisement for a pharmaceutical product of some kind. The first thing I do when I receive my monthly copy is I rip out the ads. In doing so I'm usually left with LESS THAN HALF of the pages I started with. I feel like I'm paying for a monthly subscription to pharmaceutical ads. ""Now, That's Outrageous!""I'm so sad and disappointed. I won't be renewing my subscription next year and I feel like I've lost a lifelong friend. I hope my review helps you in your decision."
3,They will not stop calling you when your subscription ends!,"First off, I agree with what others have said about too many ads. That's partly what is keeping me from renewing it.Overall..if it weren't for the ads, I would continue to enjoy this magazine because I love the humor, easy reading stories, information, etc.However...when my subscription ends they keep calling and calling and CALLING me about renewing. Or saying ""We hope you are enjoying your subscription to Readers Digest""..(when I'm not subscribed anymore). I tell them no, I'm not going to renew..the next day I come home with three calls on my answering machine from them. This is not a one time occurrence either.The magazine itself is good. However I think they should either lower the price or drop some of the ads."
2,"Lots of ads, then they spam you","RD does have some interesting consumer & finance articles, but it has waa-a-a-y too many ads. I would never actually pay for it, but I do get a subscription as a gift every year. I end up ripping half the magazine's weight out in ads - and no, that's not ""just life"" as some other reviewer said, it's downright shameful.Also, make sure you get on the RD website and change your privacy preferences; like other second-rate companies who like to abuse customers, they implicitly assume you want to be spammed by them and have them rent your information out to third parties."
1,Never again,"I've always loved this magazine, but I completely agree with the other reviewers... not ONLY are there entirely too many ads, but they make a FORTUNE selling your information. I was completely shocked at the amount of junk mail that started POURING in after I first subscribed to Reader's Digest. They should be ashamed of themselves. I do enjoy reading it, but refuse to renew out of principle."
1,Readers Digest Changes the Terms,I bought this subscription to Readers Digest here at Amazon in January 2011 and didn't receive mt first issue until March 2011. Started getting renewal letters in with my magazine about 2 months ago and got to wondering when my subscription was ending? I looked here at Amazon and it says March 2013 which is correct then I looked at the label on my magazine and it says November 2012. What's going on here that is a 4 month difference in what I paid for and what I am actually receiving. So I contacted Amazon about this and they promptly shuffled me off to Readers Digest (Thanks Amazon)who gave me a song and dance story about how the May issue was a special issue and it was so much bigger that it counted as 2 issues. Well I pulled out my May issue and it has about 10 extra pages compared to the other issues. so shame on you Readers Digest for trying to rip off consumers and an even bigger shame on you Amazon for not standing behind what you are selling.
1,Are you ready to pay for reading ads?,"I'm echoing the same sentiment as expressed by other users.If you are planning to subscribe it, because you liked it during your childhood/Teens - get ready for big disappointment. The once great RD seems to be taken over by the marketing department, who believes that less content and more ads will help them boost sales.""Goose and Golden Eggs"" story fits very well here.Problems with ads:1. TOO many ads (ya, it needed caps).2. Too few good articles.3. Too read a full article, you have to skip multiple ad pages - breaks the flow (besides being annoyance).4. First 10-12 pages are just adds.5. More than 50% of the book is made up of ads.Of course, I was disgusted with the marketing material and didn't care to renew the subscription. No wonder, they filed for bankruptcy."
2,error in ordering,I thought I was ordering the kindle version of the readers digest....so I guess I have a confused review. Have not received digest yet.
4,Almost satisfied.,I was surprised how quickly we got it. We have been getting it for quite a while and the first 2 issues you sent us were the last 2 issues we got from that subscription.Is there anyway you can add 2 more issues at the end of this subscription?Thanks for your promptness.
3,Too many ads,"I agree with the reviews about too many ads, but that is what is keeping the price low - 20 issues for $15.00 - I feel."
5,Readers Digest is the best light reading ever!,"There are times when you don't want to get caught up in reading something heavy but you want something interesting to pass the time. Reader's Digest is just that. Whether it's waiting for your doctor's appointment, kid's sport practice or thinking on the throne, if you know what I mean, this is perfect reading."
5,Reader's digest,Have always loved Reader's Digest. Quick to read and it hits on the leading articles from many journals and magazines.
2,Readers digest has changed!,"Readers Digest isn't the same as it used to be. Ats all advertising, even to the point of selling it own product (a diet book!) under the guise of a featured article, even occupying space on the cover of the book. It used to be one of my favorites, but I have little interest in it anymore."
3,Reader Digest junkie,"I hate all the commercials in the mag, but love the short, informative & entertaining stories, reports & reviews. Light reading for spare-moments, vacation,...etc. Family friendly & uncomplicated. I got the bug from my mom as a boy and with 55 still enjoy. I pass on most of my editions to others and keep a supply at our vacation cottage."
2,End date for subscription?,"I recently subscribed to Reader's Digest thru Amazon.com. Yesterday I got my first issue, which is the February 2012 issue. However, the end date for my subscription is listed as November 2012. Now, I never was a math genius, but I'm smart enough to figure out that, unless they plan to send me 3 back issues, I am going to be shorted 3 months worth of magazines on this subscription. Or did they change the calendar and now a year is only 9 months long?"
2,sending me issues leftover,"This subscription wasn't supposed to begin until March 7 2013, they already sent me the Thanksgiving 2012 magazine as my beginnig issue! sending me issues that are leftover from previous stock is not ok, and there are more ads than ever, very disappointing, they should pay me to sort through the advertisements to see what""s worth reading, nothing like the old readers digest I loved years ago."
5,Magazine Subscriptions Ordered as a Gift,"I cannot offer a review of the periodical as this subscription, along with another publication, was ordered as a gift for a nearby men's shelter. However, I can tell you that the price was great and past exposure to Reader's Digest makes me confident it will be well received by the residents at the shelter."
1,have not received yet hope to soon,I know it takes a while for subscriptions from amazon to go through but sometimes it seems to take to long. Hopefully with in the next month I will receive my first one. It has only been a little over one month at this point.
1,Disaster!,Wow! Thankfully I read all the reviews here! I was tempted to suscribe for the low price of $5 per year but even at that I don't see a point doing it so.
3,missing subscription mags,"I ALWAYS RECEIVE PEOPLE MAGAZINE ON FRI. OR SAT. I RECEIVED NO PEOPLE ONTHE 12TH OR 13 OF AUG. OR ANY TIME THAT WEEK. I SAW IT IN THE SUPERMARKETS STARTING SEPT.11TH BUT IT NEVER ARRIVED. I ALSO HAVE NOT RECEIVED READERS DIGEST FOR 2 MOS. I'VE ALSO SEEN THE LATEST SUBSCRIPTION IN THE SUPERMARKETS BUT NOT AT MY HOUSE, IT'S PISSING ME OFF. I DIDN'T PAY ALL THAT MONEY FOR NOTHING!!PLEASE SEND ME THOSE MAGAZINES. THANK YOU. r.courtright@hotmail.com"
2,Shipping very slow,"Ordered my subscription in March,2009 and received my first mag in August,2009. Recently received two mags late October, 2009. Not happy with this and i am not renewing my subscription."
4,Readers Digest,"Readers Digest offers a little bit of everything for its readers. They have stories that are thrilling, tips on how to go through everyday life (ex- how to sleep better), health tips, an advice collumn, and of course, the jokes. It is a decent magazine that holds ones attention and entertains. The one critisicm I have of this magazine is the ads. There are so many that I have to go through when I get each issue and take all of them out."
5,Love the many different stories - all in a small paperback,I really enjoy this! So many different subjects and stories! Great bathroom reading too ( doesnt take up much space!)(just takes up more time spent in the bathroom!)I also feel this is good for people of all ages!!! So many members of a family can find this interesting! Good reading material!
1,TERRIBLE NOTHING LIKE THE OLD READERS DIGEST,BACK IN THE GOOD OLE DAYS READERS DIGEST HAD LOTS AND LOTS OF QUALITY STORIES AND JOKES NOW IT IS HALF THE THICKNESS AND 45% ADVERTISEMENTS .IF YOU THINK YOU ARE BUYING A QUALITY READER YOU ARE SO SO INCORRECT.LIKE HALF THE BOOK WAS ABOUT HEALTH IF I WANTED THAT I'D BOUGHT HEALTH DIGEST.ANYTHING FROM VIAGRA TO WOMENS SEX PRODUCTS ADVERTISED HERE NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY LIKE DAYS OF OLD.THE BIGGEST WASTE OF A DEAD TREE OUT THERE SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOME OTHER PUBLICATION ....
1,Fun Magazine but...,Auto-Renewal stinks and I don't recommend it if you don't like surprises! Great magazine for the whole family with food articles and informative information.
2,I might cancel my subscription...,"Don't get me wrong, I like the content. I just have trouble finding it in a sea of ads. It's really ridiculous how many ads are in this magazine. I was reading an aritcle that I actually enjoyed, but the article was interrupted by 16 pages of ads!!! I went back and actually counted it. I'm not feeling this magazine. Trust the negative reviews on this site and look elsewhere for easy reading."
1,FAIR WARNING: Subscribe at your own risk,"Please heed the warning. After many years, I have come to believe that Reader's Digest and its associated resellers are scammers of the worst order. My mother-in-law, very senior citizen, is now the owner of 11 Reader's Digest subscriptions. At least she was being billed for them before we cancelled them all. Here's how they work: shortly after you receive your initial magazine, you'll receive a ""renewal"" offer with all sorts of warnings not to let your 'special' price offer expire. Well, as I stated, she is a senior and her memory isn't the best. So she heeds the 'warning' and within 14 months she has 11 magazines being delivered. This is unconscionable and RD knows the seniors to prey on. Their reseller--READ AMERICA was given her name and number by RD and they pestered her into paying $449.95 for Readers Digest subscriptions. These people are all despicable. I'm hoping someday an attorney will file class action suits against both of them."
5,Readers Digest,I have always enjoyed reading Readers Digest. It is a great book with many things new every month that I enjoy.
5,Love,I love having this magazine in my salon. This was a great price for such a fun short read magazine
3,gift,i bought this for a gift and the person was really happy. no complaints. good way to save some money too
1,Problem,"Magazine is fine, but subscription is not what I expected.We have received duplicate copies of Dec and Jan issues, which means you did not commence new subscription when current one expired. Please adjust your records and the new subscription so we get a full year's worth, beginning when our current subscription expires."
1,Never received,"I ordered this subscription and another, paid for of course, I have never received either one and have not been notified as to why. I have tried to contact Amazon over this matter to no avail. my opinion is dont order mag. subscriptions thru Amazon."
3,"Love Reader's Digest, don't like the subscription practices","I subscribed to this for a year when I saw it on sale for five bucks on November 19. I had to wait until the second week of January to actually receive an issue (the February issue). Then a week later I received the Dec/Jan issue and the November issue. I don't like that. If you're going to unload those months on me in order to meet your 12-issue obligation sooner, why make me wait close to two months to receive them? The November issue should've been sent to me immediately, or not at all. Same thing with the Dec/Jan one -- either send it to me when it's supposed to come, or keep it to yourself. Love Reader's Digest, but I probably won't renew unless they offer another five-dollar deal."
5,Awesome!,"My son and daughter (ages 2 and 3 respectively) and I have been watching this series off of RFD-TV and we love it. It's got music, lots of action, some humor, great photographic quality and lots of history. It's hosted by a kid, which should tell you what audience this is aimed at. We don't have the DVD yet.. but if it's the same as what's shown on RFD-TV, which I'm sure it is, it's sure to be a favorite. At this age, they like it much better than ""There Goes a Train"", which has very little train action and lots of adults talking"
5,The Fontane Sisters,"This music recaptures the happy memories, feelings and dreams of my youth, bringing those whom I knew and loved at that time into clearer focus."
2,bam43467@pbs6.milton.port.ac.uk,I thought this book was pretty difficult to follow and the plot was very thin. I must admit I gave up half way through as the story bored me to tears.James MonnellyPortsmouth University
1,.,"This is worse than Power Rangers (oh, you want to know what THOSE are...). If someone brought that up as a storyline, if would take it for a joke."
5,Have to agree,I read this in graduate school 25 year ago. It is one of the few books from that period that I want to reread from start to finish. Seems more important now even than it did then. Absolutely is ready for a re-print. Hold on to your copy if you have one!
4,"M. Johnson ""collector""",I came across this by accident. I really enjoyed the characters and the plot. I found the locale exotic andthe insider tidbits interesting. I hope there will be more books featuring Jason.
5,Great !,"I loved this book.... i bemoan the fact that Karen Robards seem to have move away from sprawling historials to modern romance/suspense...although i enjoy those books as well. The setting was different with Srinagar and a tea plantation . The romance was fanatastic and they do feel for julian who feels he has to compete with Ana's deceased husband Paul, whioo happens to be his half brother! the4 ending was spooky and different but overall the book was a night of reading pleasure !"
4,Sometimes the Obvious isn't so....Obvious!,"When an intruder (Julian) fails to accomplish his goal, Anna takes advantage of it. Wanting nothing more than to get as far away as possible from her brother-in-law...she flees and is quite surprised when Julian shows up. He is set on revenge but that's not quite what happened. This story has adventure, playfulness and romance all in one package. Very enjoyable read and recommended."
3,Julian was great!,"I enjoyed the story mostly because of Julian. He was a likeable hero and extremely sexy. Ana seemed sweet but took a little to long to realize her love for Julian. And why did she always call her daughter ""chicken?"" The ending was a bit much for me too."
4,Great notebook!,"These notebooks are a great size- about 8-10"". The paper is smooth, a nice pale green, and the pages are numbered- which means I can keep track of my notes, and find references more easily. I prefer ones with a spiral binding- but I have a pile of these as well. Good notebook!"
5,I Believe I can Fly Is the greatest song ever written,"I love this song. This song is amazing. When my grandpa was dying of cancer, I turned on the radio and heard this song and I thought that everything was going to be OK. When he passed away I turned on this song. Every time i hear this song it makes me think about him and me. I am 13 and have a hard road this past year but this song makes me think everything will turn out fine."
5,FANTASTIC!!...,what can I say about this Classic from R.Kelly? truly one of His Highlights as a Composer&Producer.His Vocals truly hit home on this Award Winning Song.One of His Best&if the Guy could Ever balance some of His Other Material we could be Hearing Genius in His Work? He has that Poetential in Him if He ever figures out how to balance the two.
4,It's cool,"I like ""I beleive I can fly"" a lot. It's better than a lot of other songs I've heard, but it's not #1 on my list . Probably more like #2, or 3."
1,You Can Never Go Home Again,"I was looking for a bit of nostalgia with this purchase as I remember sneaking up to watch ""Bizarre"" as a young lad of nine or ten when the episodes were rerun on network television(desperately hoping that the guy in charge of placing the black box that covered the girls boobs would slack on his job just once). Alas, these skits are terrible, and should be avoided--unless you happen to be a ten year old boy that has very liberal parents, or you have the maturity level of a preteen. Even when judging these episodes in an early 80's vacuum it's hard to see ""Bizarre"" as the purveyor of impudence that it was billed as. If your looking for cornball sketch comedy from around the same time period check out the ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" which has at least one skit that still manages to offend."
5,Unpredictable is the Bomb,"Mystikal is the type of artist who makes you feel what he is saying. I've been listening to him even before he was with No Limit. Mystikal has that FIRE!!! Unpredictable just continues to prove this. If you've never listened to Mystikal before, it would take less than a minute to get hooked on his lyrics."
5,The best solo project from any of the No Limit Soldiers,"Although he doesn't have the singing talent of Bone Thugs and Harmony or the smoothness of TWISTA, Mystikal brings it raw!!!! Not only are the beats amazing, but Mystikal has learned to drop true knowledge the southern way. From rapping about the death of his sister to about signing with No Limit, Mystikal's rap stays tight and combined with the excellent production, it makes for an album to bump in the club, car, and crib."
5,This cd is the best by the No Limit family,"This cd is so much better than Mystikal's first release, Mind of Mystikal, it is incredible. Mystikal finally found his style and has lots of great No Limit beats to back him up. Favorite Songs: The Man Right Chea, Still Smokin', Here We Go, and Did I Do It. A must buy for ANY No Limit fan!"
4,I wanna give it 4.5 stars!,"This is a great album from the Man Right Chea himself, Mystikal! Mystikal is tight and also hilarious with his crazy, flippin lyrics that work well with the tight beats on this cd! The best song on here is Here We Go but most of the other songs are tight as well, including 13 Years, Unpredictable, Ain't No Limit, Murder 2(which I think they messed the title up on. It should be Murderer 2, but oh well), U Can't Handle This, The Man Right Chea, D**k On The Track, and Sleepin With Me. This is an excellent cd from No Limit, so if yoou like No Limit, or if you just like Mystikal, or if you just like crazy, hilarious lyrics, then check this album out today!"
5,Mystikal is da bomb!,I love this CD as well as all others he has composed. Mystikal is my all time favorite rap artist and always will be. He is so real and I understand everthing he says whether he's screamin or just rapping. He is the bomb and I want his new album cause I had all the others. This CD is too cool.
1,It is the worst CD in No-Limit,"I thought this CD sucked! I don't know why people like it. I mean I don't know why I even bought this CD. People thinks that Mystikal is the best rapper in No Limit, but Master P and Silkk is way better! P's bout it bout it!! No Limit is phat, but Mystikal is bad!"
1,Close but no Cigars!!!,"Mystical comes off as a poor imitation of Busta Rhymes. He has no lyrical skill and his style is just whack. No I am not a fan of Mystical or the whole NO Limit crew. I like Master P, Silk tha Shocker, and Mia X, but thats about it. They all need to work on their style and beats, but his is the worst. Don't waste your time and hard-earned money on this crap!!!!"
5,Mystikal & P,This is a tight azz album. When P uses his old voice like he used to on all his earlier albums and you put thath with Mystikal you got Platinum music. Born 2 Be A Soldier has to be one of the tightest songs No Limit has ever made. This album is tight. No one can hold Mystikal. NO LIMIT 4 LIFE.
2,Why'd I buy this again!?,"Ok...so it's a marquee name from no limit, so I guess I know why I bought it, but I must say I'm dissapointed with the lackluster beats and how little of depth Mystikal shows throughout the album, I like 1 song so I can't slam it totally, but I must say those rappers from New Orleans needed alittle extra help for this one!!"
3,Don't Panc! There's a better CD!,"This alblums OK, The track with E-40 and B-Legit is one of the best and ""The Man Right Chea"" Is tight. But this alblum is pretty mediocore. But ""Ghetto Fabulous"" is outstanding! by all means, if you hated ""Unpredictable"" and didn't pick up ""Ghetto Fabulous"" You need to go get It. Mystikal is a great rapper, and his second alblum is much better"
2,Poor use of a great rapper,"I think that Mystikal has a great flow, but the tunes on these songs were just not catchy. Anyone who has heard his first cd will be dissapointed."
2,LESS THAN WHAT I EXPECTED,"This album is a lot less than what I expected. I bought GHETTO FABULOUS and thought that it was one of the best cds ever. I still do, but this one sucks. I read all the reviews about how great it was, but when I bought it I was very disappointed. The only song I kind of like is track 1. If you think this cd is good than buy Ghetto Fabulous, it will quickly become your favorite cd."
5,da illest cd from the no limit family,"Mystikal brings a lot to the game with his fast rhymes and tight lyrics. thiz album has a lot of phat songs like born 2 be a soldier, and 13 years just to name a few. if u like mystikal or the no limit family thiz iz certaintly a cd to have for your collection."
3,Nothing new under the sun,Despite being a Nicola Conte's fan I think that his new album for Blue Note is a pretentious attempt to switch from the fresh sound of the previous albums to a boring excercise of re-reading the glorious sound of the jazz of the fifties and sixties. It doesn't sound new and fresh at all (apart from Kind of sunshine very much in the St.Germain style).What saves this album is the quality of the musicians that took part to it and the fact that the tracks that originally inspired Nicola Conte's ones are so good that any copy can't be that bad. But next time I expect a change of direction...again.
1,So bad I returned it for a refund.,"I am a Georgette Heyer fan, but this book used so much slang that it was irritating to read - so much so that after forcing myself to read half the book I gave up and returned it for a refund.Georgette Heyer has written so many fabulous books, sadly this is not one of them. It is the only Heyer book I've not finished."
3,"A Fun book, if a little unpolished","I've read where this was originally written as a serial, so some things got stuck in which were never afterward addressed as the story evolved into something else than Heyer originally envisioned. Nevermind! An amusing time is still had by all."
4,Interesting with a Unique Setting,"At 29, Captain John Staple is the heir-presumptive to Earldom but prefers an adventurous life. After his mother and sister unsuccessfully introduce him to a few eligible ladies, he decides to journey to Leicestershire to his friend's estate. On his way he ends help at a toll-gate run by a scared boy, Ben. Captain Staple notices Ben's father is missing and decideds to stay until he returns. He meets Miss Nell Stornaway and realizes there is a mystery surrounding her cousin and his unwelcomed friend staying with her.Not one of her best books, but the characters and mystery kept me engaged. The romance doesn't evolve over time but is love at first sight. The setting is unique and Heyer gives an interesting persceptive into the life one leads while working in a toll-gate. I found the slang a little difficult to understand at times but it is a book I would again and again.Clean romance. Would recommend this to Regency fans who enjoy a little bit of mystery."
5,One of her best,"I haven't stopped to think which of Ms. Heyer's regency romances might be my favorite but this is definitely in the running. Captain Staple is the kind of man who finds adventure or it finds him, so it's no wonder that a rainy night and a missing toll keeper turns into a romance, a wedding, a robbery and several murders, not in that order."
5,Big Fan,"I have always loved Georgette Heyer and this novel is no exception- what an adventure! A quick, but satisfying read."
4,"Good story, enjoyable characters","This is one of Heyer's most enjoyable books in my opinion. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because of the over-use of Regency slang words, which annoys me. That's probably the only complaint I have about some of Heyer's books in general, and fortunately she did not do it in all her books. The story here and the characters are excellent and the book moves along at a nice clip. There are no dead spots in the story. I loved the characters; Heyer really had a gift for nailing people's foibles and not making her heroes and heroines too perfect. Highly recommended."
1,Wrong format,"didn't realize I made a mistake in ordering, I wanted DVD format this is a vhs. Can't use. Shipping a ordering was great. Just can't view the contents."
1,A complete waste of time and money.,"I am planning a new business, and payed for this book, along with express shipping, since it is very topical. I feel cheated since the book is completely worthless. My only consolation is writing this review.There is not enough information in this book to make a newspaper article. Aside from very short interviews with Angels that are scattered randomly among the pages, the book consists of constant repitition of a few very simple ideas:1. Angels invest their own money, VC invest other peoples2. Some Angels may be able to help you with your business. Some may not.3. Don't waste potential investors time, make sure your business plan is short and reasonable.Thats the whole book. Many other reviewers (who signed themselves ""A Reader"") praised this book. I have to question their impartiality.If you are planning a new business and looking for investors, I can offer you some free and valuable advice. Don't waste your time reading this book."
4,Stopping sex trafficing,This is a subject that little or no attention is given. It is nice to see someone address it. It is amazing what human beings can do to each other.
3,OK,"I should have been able to read this comic-book straight through in a few hours. Unfortunately the book was a bit dry so it took me three sittings to finish reading it. My main purpose in reading this comic-book was to see how it might pique my interest in history. It succeeded to some extent as I've become more interested in learning about the events surrounding the Alamo. In particular how the ""best"" history compares with the portrayal in the John Wayne movie as I've never seen the movie before. I've also become more curious about cuban and puerto rican immigration to the US. So its a decent way to spend some time, but I'd borrow it from the library instead of buying it as I don't think you'll find yourself returning to it to fire your curiosity."
4,A new way to see...,"Deliciously left wing, and direct and powerful, Ilan Stavans is not afraid to stand and be counted and he knows that you might not like what he has to say. And what he has to say is "" Look here. This is good. This is powerful.""He reaches out to inform -- and celebrate the culture-- with authority and panache. He speaks the truth about the oppressed and the oppressor and his book pulls no punches in a direct attack on any hint of a poor Latino self-image. No time for pity here because the time for ascendance is coming.This book is a necessary shakeup. It's a primer, albeit uneven at times, to folks outside the Latino community and a step in reaching out to those who don't know the truth of their (varied) civilizations.Rich and potent, this opinionated polemic stands out as a tool to understanding and pride."
5,El Profe Y La Cucaracha,"Ilan Stavans studies and teaches Latino and Latin American culture and most recently authored Spanglish: The Making Of A New American Language. Lalo Alcaraz reaches the public on a daily basis through his most excellent comic strip La Cucaracha. Together they have joined to take the reader on a trip through Latino USA: A Cartoon History. Biting and sweet, biased and fair, incomplete but thorough, Latino USA is a good way to introduce yourself to the history of the majority minority in the United States. The scholarship is tight and Alcaraz's art makes it go down easy. I can't wait to get my copy into the school library, where I hope some of my not very cosmopolitan anglo students and not as self-aware as they could be latino students get pulled in by the drawings and learn a little history. I highly recommend this book!"
5,Incredible fun!,This book made me laugh a lot. It is very witty! I loved the cartoons and the text and the way they are connected.
5,Kitchenaid Pots,These pots are the best quality! They will last a lifetime. Several people in my family own more than one set of these pots. You will not be disappointed.
1,Coating doesn't last,The coating doesn't last and the warranty stinks! You have to ship the heavy item to them and they'll decide if it should be replaced or not. No guarantees. I just threw mine out.
2,Beautiful - works great - exterior needs improvement,"I bought the 12 inch skillet just like this set to try it out and used it for 2 months - and loved it - before ordering this set. I was SO looking forward to it (except for the stainless lids). The first (and only) time I cooked in the large pot, I boiled some ribs in salt, pepper and garlic. It boiled over the sides and actually damaged the finish !! I cleaned and cleaned, but there was a permanent stripe down the sides where the liquid ran over. The inside and exterior bottom were a breeze to clean, but not the red enamel. I sent mine back and ordered the black anodized set. Not nearly as pretty, but very durable and easy to keep looking good."
2,"No thanks, Kitchenaid.",The finish on these is falling apart after a year of use. There isn't really much else to say except that my knife set from them isn't in much better shape - maybe I received an unlucky batch but I think I will pick up a different set from a different company when I replace these at the end of the year.
2,"less than 6 years of usage, this set is worthless",i use some pots everyday. i must say i am so disappointed. the interior of the pots burn now. i overheated some corn the other day.. i am still trying to get the burned pieces off. i used pans for making candy.. the pots bend and distort. i used the little fry pan everyday to make my scrambled tofu.. it is worthless now because everything sticks to it. i dug out my 40 year old stainless steel pots and will use them from now on. kitchenaid must have had this set made in china. Beware of you buy this set. looks cute.. works fine for a couple years.. then the finish is off and stuff burns. this cookware i purchased in 2006 is now worthless and awful.. uggghhh
5,Kirchenaid 12-piece-Red,"The product performs very well. And, the red really adds a great splash of color to my kitchen."
5,great set,"LOVE this set. It cooks really evenly and quickly, but is thick enough to not burn things. It isn't dishwasher safe, which seems like a bit of a pain, but these pans clean so easily you're done before you even think you got started! One of the lids from the saucepans also fits on one of the skillets, so there is only one skillet that doesn't have a lid to fit it. The largest skillet holds a ton of food, great for cooking for a lot of people or oversize items (I cook hamsteak in it). Because of the coating on the inside of the pans, food does not stick to it. At all. These pans are fantastic."
3,Kitchenaid cookware set,"I have Kitchenaid mixers, both stand and hand), food processor (which I love), blender, two toasters, knife set, a 12-cup coffeemaker,and a set of cookware all in red!! This is the first Kitchenaid product with which I have not been completely satisfied. When I found this one on sale, I bought it for the 12"" skillet. I had planned to give the other pieces as gifts. I was disappointed that the pieces were not as heavy as my other cookware. The 12"" skillet ""bucked"" (raised in the middle) when it was heated. It didn't stay flat on the eye. If I had not already been using the original set, I might have been satisfied with it."
4,"Good,but not dishwasher Safe","I have only had these items for about a week now. I saw them at the local outlet store for the same price as amazon, however I purchased them online to avoid the huge sales tax in IL, as well as having to lug them around the store, when I get free shipping on Amazon. So far they look great, and cook well. They are not dishwasher safe. If you want to get the best life out of them you will need to wash them by hand."
3,Heavy handles,"It's a very pretty set, I did not get much use of it yet, so I cannot say a lot. The only problem and I think it might be a big problem is that handles are very heavy and my small pot would not stay on the stove, it constantly was tipping over."
5,Love these!,"My husband bought this set for me for my birthday, and it's by far the best birthday present I have ever received. NOTHING sticks to these babies! The first time I overcooked the parma rosa sauce, I let the pan soak in the sink for an hour before I whipped out the sponge prepared to do some scrubbing; I was officially in love when the sink sprayer eliminated the whole mess before I even had a chance to USE the sponge! It was like magic, especially compared to my old pans.A couple of reviewers have mentioned that these are not dishwasher safe; well I didn't know that and I have been putting them in the dishwasher for over a year without any problems. Hopefully that continues!"
3,Must not use on ceramic/glasstop stove,"The item description did not state that if you use these pans on a ceramic/glasstop stove the pan may ""fuse to the stovetop requiring replacement of the stovetop"". If you don't have a glass cooktop this is a very nice set for the price."
4,Minnesota cook,"I put mine in the dishwasher anyway. The red has discolored somewhat, but the coating is fine and they cook great."
2,Not Dishwasher or Stovetop Safe,"I just bought this set and was dismayed to note in the ""Important Safety, Use & Care Information"" that the set is not dishwasher safe and is not recommended for use on Ceramic/Glass Stovetops."
1,don't buy if you have a flat electric cooktop,"Do not buy these products if you have a flattop stove. You can't turn yourstove top over medium heat or else the pot melts onto your cooktop ruining your stove! They don't tell you that the ceramic will melt at too high a temp and bond to your cooktop so beware!! It seems like the chance of this happening would be low, no, I put a pot onto boil med-high and the pot started to fuse to my cooktop. I smelt the burning but it still left some pot residue on one of the burners...Yuck. Probably great for a gas stove"
3,Come on-your inner child is calling!!,Your five years old and its christmas-wow what a gift!! These video's are enchanting for any age. You know you've always wanted a train running around that tree-but this is much more!! Buy this and enjoy remembering!
1,"Toy Trains and Christmas is a real "" Bummer"".","This video is interesting for model builders that want some ideas. For watching with the kids, this video is extremely boring. We watched it with our grandkids, ages 4 to 9. They laughed and mocked the music and lyrics. All three begged me top turn it off. I would not waste the time or money on this video if you are looking for something interesting and entertaining for the kids at christmas. If you are a model builder, you may get some ideas for your project."
2,Rabbit doesn't like,"You get a lot which is great, however my rabbit doesn't like them, she pushes them away or tosses them around. I guess she's just picky."
5,if you like fruit roll-ups you'd love tamarind,The products are fresh and great tasting. I recommand them for anybody who likes tart dried fruits.
3,Burin Down the Barn,The is a nice edition to your colection if you would like to make sure that you havent over looked a good C.D. by a great artest.Its not as great as his first release but there are some very good songs.
1,Cheap made in China,This pillow is cheap acrylic and made in China. It smells awful when you take it out of the bag. I returned it immediately.
2,"Cute, but not as well made as it could be","The pillow is adorable, and my son loves it, but the seam ripped very easily when I was carefully removing the tag."
2,Didn't work,I was told by ATT n T that any DSL router will work with them. Either they where wrong or the routers is bad. Been to busy to find original boxes to try an return
4,Somewhat easy to use.,"Pros: Replaced this with my 2Wire ATT modem. Easy to assemble out of the box. Works perfectly. Gotta love the 4 ethernet ports.Cons: Setting up the connections on the modems configuration page was the hardest. I have mild networking experience, and after going through the wizard twice, I had to call in their tech support for help. Got everything working correctly within 20-30 minutes including setting up the WPA2 security. The modem doesn't run too hot to touch like some people say on here, but runs warm. The wireless range is somewhat terrible. I get between 2-3 bars (out of 5) and I'm right upstairs above it.Other than that, a better modem over my 2Wire."
4,very good product,"Worked great out of the box. continues to work great. The user interface is less intuitive than linksys, but not too bad."
4,Good modem/wireless router,We've had the product set up for 2 months; range is fine in our house and speed is great. I've had to reset once.
4,Excellent product,"Set up was not very clear in the written instructions, and I wound up having to call in for some assistance over the phone. I have had products that installed easier I would say. However, it has been very stable and offered wonderful service now that it is running, so I can't complain too much at all. Definately a good product."
2,poor support & couldn't update firmware,I needed help setting up wireless connection. The internet download speed wasn't what it should have been. I used their support twice and still couldn't download their firmware update for the device.Their support is off-shore. The first person was hard to understand. The second contact was OK. Each time they would end the support session after maybe 10 minutes by saying try this or that & if it didn't resolve the issue to call back.I resolved the issue by returning the device.
4,D-link Modem + DSL-Router,"This product is definetley worth it, espescially when the service provider offers a crappy alternative for 40% more. Setup was not so easy, but after consulting a couple of forums online, it worked like a charm. If you want to pay less and struggle a little to get it working, then this product is totally what you need."
5,D-Link works well,I bought this D-Link modem/wireless router to replace a Speedstream 5360 modem and a Linksys wireless router. It works MUCH better than the other system I was using. This system has been very stable--no more random disconnects from the internet or continual problems with the wireless system that I was experiencing previously. The D-Link wireless router has a much stronger signal than the Linksys it replaced. My D-Link system is in a building next to my house (about 20 feet away) and I can recieve signals anywhere in the house on a laptop with no problem at all--the Linksys was only usable in one room. The set up was easy and I like the combination modem/router--does not clutter up the desk. D-Link has created a good prodcut for my application.
1,Don't buy it,The thing has firm-wear that's 5 years old and no new updates. The max LAN and Wireless speed is 1 MB/s regardless of your ISP. If they came out with new firm-wear I think it would work just fine.
1,AWFUL!!!,"This unit along with the Tech. Support are ridiculous. I had to return it. MAC buyers beware: either I rec'd a bad CD manual or it is incompatible w/ MAC. It would never read. I went back to the 2WIRE from AT&T DSL, & it was a DREAM to install, unlike the NIGHTMARE which was the D-Link. Good Luck if you purchase this...DO NOT RECOMMEND."
5,a breeze to install with Linux,"For years, I have used a DSL modem (SpeedStream 5360) and D-Link DI-604 router, for my PPPoE account with AT&T. I just got a new wireless Netbook running Linux, and so shopped for a wireless router. After studying the reviews on several routers, the DIR-655 was my first choice. However, the wireless died a week later, and returned it. My next choice was the DSL-2640B (modem and wireless router combo). I used the CD to view the User Manual. Login under the admin account. Chose the auto-connect and it did not work; no DSL connection was found. So I disabled the DSL Auto-connect box, and followewd the various screens. I was able to get on the Internet with my Linux desktop. The final step was to setup the wireless in the router (first) in the netbook (second) using the same security autentication: shared (WEP 128-bit key) using 13 ascii password. Rebooted the netbook and it worked."
1,Terrible product,At first it was working well even if it did not process all my downloads. The setup for your computer was a little confusing. The worst part was when after about 6 months of use it broke on me. I tried to reset it called the service guys but they told me it was dead. So yes it might be cheap but it is still not worth it.
1,Did not work,"I spent more than two hours on the phone with D-Link trying to make this product work. They were courteous, but not able to make the product work with CenturyLink DSL service. I believe the product is okay, but they claimed that it was broken, and would not let me directly ship it to them. They made me return it to the vendor, which did not help. I ended up getting a new router/modem from another company."
1,Didn't work out of the box. Returned.,"I bought this unit about a year ago and forgot to update for review.I logged onto the router's firmware, then the next day, I could no longer access the router.Then I returned it. I'm using a Linksys now."
1,DEFECTIVE OUT OF THE BOX,After wasting a couple of hours with D-link techs. finally determined unit was defective. Amazon was great about how painless they made the return.
4,Not bad,I tried several Netgear models before using this one. They randomly dropped the connection for 1 or 2 computers while others working fine. I don't have this problem after using this one. This one works much more reliable.
5,"Ah, to have just a single box","Like the other reviewers, I replaced an old SpeedStream DSL modem and an aging D-Link wireless router whose power supply (in the plug) had gone south. While I could have replaced just the power cord, I took this opportunity to replace the DSL modem for not too much more money.I've been consistently happy with D-Link routers, and this model is no exception. I found the UI to be similar to D-Link's previous routers and easy to configure. I did use their wizard to get things up in a moment, but went on to configure the known MAC address, security, and so on.The clincher: my network connections have been up for the last week! This is a huge win. The old SpeedStream dropped the connections several times a day.So, if you've got a separate DSL modem and wireless router and flaky network performance, run--don't walk--and get this device. And bring your old devices to Green Citizen."
1,Disconnect over night,"the connection keep disconnect every night, turn off and turn back on to connect to internet again, try many different setting still got the same problem, do a reasearch online realize this is a common problem and there still no solution for it. D-link customer service is a joke, they couldn't help me at all after 3 hour on the phone. I give up."
5,Excellent product!,I changed my speedstream wireless modem/router to the DLink because i needed to configure some parameters that where not available at the speedstream and it was a great surprise the easy way to configure the first time the ADSL service with this product.All the features are useful. The configuration could be more user friendly but is ok.Recently i bougth another to change a friend speedstream + linksys wireless and the results where excellent. More stability and wireless range.All DLink producs i have bought are quality and a good experience.
1,Did Not Work and Had to Return It.,I purchased this modem/router but had to return it because the modem did not work. I kept thinking I was setting it up wrong so I had to call an AT&T tech over to the house to help. He checked it and the modem was faulty.
4,"Great product, hard setup",I really love this product. It works really well. My only complaint is that it took a long time to set up. most of this was problems with my ISP. So just be prepared for the usual hoops for the initial setup. After I got it set up I haven't had a signal problem. All in all I would really recommend this product.
3,"Worked fine, but only lasted a year...","This product was relatively difficult to set up, but it worked very well. I gave it three stars though because it only lasted a year."
4,low profile,I like this because it has cut the clutter on my desk. I had trouble setting it up (but don't recall what it was b/c it was 8 mos ago) but I am no genius with networks. In the end I got it setup on my desktop PC and it has worked flawlessly with no need to mess with it since. It is pricey but I really did not want a separate modem and router and this was one of the few choices. I am able to easily join the network with my macbook and iphone as are all of my visitors. I keep it in a cabinet with a glass door and can still get a signal throughout my small house and even in the yard maybe 100ft radius...
1,Terrible Wireless Router,"Unless you only plan on using this router for a few weeks, don't buy it. I can echo other reviewers' complaints about the company's customer service. The only thing they know how to do is blame your service provider and tell you to reset the modem. That is literally the full extent of their knowledge on trouble-shooting device issues. I will say that the modem/router works reasonably well for a wired connection, but has TERRIBLE range if you plan on using it for a Wi-fi network. In addition, I've had it only a short time and the wireless feature no longer works at all. D-Link has refused to give me a refund. I would not waste your time with this device when there are much better ones out there, for a few more bucks."
3,So so,Compact. Good price. But user interface very difficult to figure out and use. Tech support on phone was usually good.
4,"Not exactly plug and play, but.....","It took a little bit of playing with different configs, but once I got it working it is perfect. This device is way better than the speedstream ""toy"" router Windstream supplied, which was like having dialup since you had to reboot it so often."
4,good,"As other say, this is a warm product when in use. It works well for me. It was annoying to set it up with AT&T, but ultimately the problems were because of ATT DSL, not this router modem. There aren't too many of this combo out there. I'm glad this one exists."
