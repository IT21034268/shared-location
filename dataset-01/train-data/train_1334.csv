1,cancelled order. 7 yr+ (ex) amazon member,"i also bought this plasma, only to receive an e-mail from amazon 2 days later stating the order was canceled because the seller could not receive payment from amazon. why is the seller on amazon? how could they allow this? there is no way to call amazon, & if you try to e-mail, forget it, you get a auto-reply with a sorry, but, response. you are better off buying local and paying a few more dollars...."
1,Item out of stock,I tried to purchase this item but got an email two days later ( after having gone through the exercise of talking to credit card company etc ) that the order is cancelled because this item is out of stock . I wish Amazon removed this item from their website to avoid waste of time of buyers.
2,Order from a seller (Market Place) not entertained,"I tried to buy this item from a seller named 'lovekars' (listed in Amazon's Market Place). After exchanging several emails with the seller through Amazon's service to get answers to some of my questions ans seller agreeing to sell it at the stated price I put the order on last sunday (07/15/2007) giving out my name, shipping details and qty as asked for by the seller hoping to get the transaction initiated by the seller using Amazon's Payment System (As suggested by him). Even after a repeated email I did not get any response from the seller - either confirming the sale or denying it for any reason whatsoever he may have. I am not sure why such unscrupulous sellers are in Amazon's Market Place. They might take any buyer for a ride at any stage of the transaction and delivery of goods and products sold through the Amazon's Market Place."
4,The Dead Moon Circus Arrives!,"This DVD contains six uncut episodes: In both Japanese and EnglishMeeting of Fate! The Night where a Pegasus FliesSuper Transformation Again! Pegasus' PowerProtect A Mother's Dream! The New Attack for Double MoonCapture the Pegasus! The Amazon's TrapA Couple Made For Each Other! Usagi's and Mamoru's Loveand finallyArtemis' Affair? A Mysterious Kitten Appears!Master Zirconia and her band of evil circus minions arrive on earth to start some major trouble. The Amazon Trio emerges as the newest group of villians for the Sailor Soldiers to fight. Sailor Moon's battle against them goes badly until Pegasus gives her and Chibi-Moon a super power. You want to know more? Buy the DVD or Video, but of course the DVD is highly recommended if you want all of the nice features this DVD does have. This is the start of Sailor Moon SuperS! Enjoy."
4,The third best series in the SM arc,"I say this is the third, because for me the first is SMS and the second is SMStars. Still, the SMSS is ok compared to the other series because it has Pegasus, I'm not a fan of chibi-moon, that's another reason why i i give this dvd 4 stars and it's my third favorite season. Anyways if you get a chance buy the dvd, it's better than those dub versions."
5,Sailor Moon one and the same,"The uncut episodes are not much different from their Toonami counter parts expect for a few questionable footage and excerpts and the original Japanese tracks, stills , images and Songs. I'm talking the first DVD."
1,"Cute, but that's all","I am a HUGE fan of Sailor Moon and I have to say that I was utterly disappointed when I got this. I received this, as well as Sailor Moon SuperS Pegasus Collections 2,3, and 5 for Christmas of 2002.I had high expectations for the series at first, but those high expectations suddenly turned to low ones.This has to be the worst Sailor Moon season by far.It is completely boring and focuses mainly on Chibiusa and Pegasus.If you want to watch a good Sailor Moon season, watch either the first season (Sailor Moon) or the third (S)."
5,This is one of NL's BEST SONGS EVER MADE,This song is da bomb.I think it is one of the best NO LIMIT songs ever made.They should make more like this one.The old NO LIMIT hits are starting to come back to be better than the new ones.My favorite song is Real N***** Gon Ride.
5,Satisfied,I got a very nice book. Delivery was rapid. Inside the book I found a letter with the author's signature (the author was an eminent mathematician). Overall I was very satisfied with the purchase. Good seller!
1,WARNING: Repacaged Music,"This is a very sleazy record company trick of repackaging music and get unwary fans to buy the same thing twice.There is a whole series of these ""Extended Versions"" CD's from BMG Special Products. All they have done is repackaged material from a group's live album or albums. They don't even include all of the songs from the original album. Plus the packaging is very cheap and there are no liner notes.Beware of anything that comes from BMG Special Products. If you are any kind of fan of the band, you probably already own it."
2,not made in usa,"I was disappointed to find these klein ""tools"" were not made in usa.just an FYI... NOT MADE IN USA!"
5,Great Story,I've read this story over and over again to my son and daughter. My daughter particularly loves this story. The story has a great message.
5,Jessica is in France with a famous chief.,"Although I prefer the setting of the Murder She Wrote novels in Cabot Cove, I just say that this is one of my favories. It's interesting and filled with French culture and wonderful food! Hope you enjoy this one as much as I did."
1,It makes your monitor fuzzy,"I thought it wasn't going to be that bad after seeing a review but it's just as it sounds. This cable makes the screen so fuzzy, it's hard to type."
4,works,It works as to be expected.I bought it for my lab at my work place. Nothing else to say really.
3,Functional but dims monitor,Mmmmm.... functional but it does noticably dim the computer monitor when my flat screen is plugged into the splitter. This occurs even if my flat screen is turned off and is not in use. Please also note the computer screen and an external monitor may not work on the same resolutions. You may have to switch your computer display settings to view either external flat screen or the computer monitor. It can be a bit of a hassel. Price is right though and it will work in a pinch.
3,"Works well on lcd tv, not pc monitor","I purchased this item so that I could connect my lcd tv and my pc monitor continuously, without crawling behind the computer to change cords every time we wanted to use the lcd tv. The quality on the 30"" lcd tv is fine - no problem viewing; however, the 20"" lcd pc monitor picture quality was terrible. Horizontal lines appeared that made it nearly impossible to read the screen. Overall, this cable did not satisfy our needs."
4,Performs as required.,"Works great, no complaints. It's a d-sub Y splitter so there's not that much to write about and I don't have any complaints. Image quality was just as good as it was before. Gave 4 stars because I have neither a similar product to compare to nor the desire to do any extensive testing."
5,Great seller!!!!,"I bought this cable for my teacher, and even though it was the wrong one, I did find another use for it, and it is great!!! The price was fantastic, and the shipping was very quick,, will buy here again."
3,Okay in a pinch.,"This cable works okay, but note that the brightness of both monitors will be cut in half. This works fine if the brightness is already turned down, but on a dim monitor, it might not work to well."
3,"Works, well, kinda",This item works but I cannot have both the TV and computer monitor hooked up at the same time. The TV will make a buzzing sound and the picture displayed cannot be deciphered. Its all snow and lines. But it works perfect if I disconnect one and leave the other in. I was hoping I wouldn't have to do that but at least I do not have to unscrew it from behind the TV to hook up the monitor. I am happy with my purchase even though it doesn't work 100% like I thought it would.
5,Y CABLE,not to much to say about this Y CABLE it does its job I've had this for some time now and never had any problems with it works great.
3,"Picture does not degrade, but brightness does.","I've got a small flatpanel over my treadmill that I wanted to run off the same computer as my main work monitor, and I bought this to split the signal. The resolution is fine. I can watch movies over the flatpanel while I'm on the treadmill, but the signal to the main monitor is so dim it is really useless for anything other than writing reviews like this, so I've ended up buying a VGA extender/amplifier, and this thing goes into the spare cable bin."
4,Fast and good,It is really good products much cheaper than stores and i recieved in 2 days which is awesome.I bought other stuff from Amazon now also because you get good rates as well fast delivery service.Thanks Amazon
3,Hollow - Cracked Piece - Cheap,"I am disappointed. One of the panels was cracked when I opened the box. You would think that you were getting a solid piece of particle board for the sides/top/bottom of the cubes, but the pieces are cheaply made and HOLLOW. This would be good for a playroom, as the modular aspect is nice and you aren't out TOO much money if it gets trashed and the pieces DID fit together quite nicely, and very easily (put the whole thing together in about an hour.. by myself) It doesn't LOOK that bad, (basically just like the picture here on Amazon). I would not purchase this again though, as it IS cheaply made... and I don't really like that it's HOLLOW."
3,Alright product. Things You Should Know,This is an okay product the parts didn't necessarily fit together perfectly (may have to make the dowels holes wider with a pair of scissors). The material is pretty much plywood and is easily cracked. They don't stack easily and attaching them with screws and what not like the manual says can split the plywood in the back. The screw caps don't stay in and don't always even go in either.
2,Do Not Purchase,"This product is so small it's not really worth the amount paid. There are many defects that are already listed in other reviews, broken/split boards, drawers impossible to line up and just not at all what I expected. I would advise that you DO NOT Purchase this Item!"
2,HIGH Damage rate,"I like the idea of a stackable units, so I can build my own, but the hollow core construction, its a idea, just bad idea. Makes this feel cheap and non-durable. Got it and found the hollow pieces were all broke. The hollow pieces are the bottom and top pieces, so things can easily break through. Too much pressure on the hollow parts and it will go right through, the paper lining is the only support.If your eyeing this, please get it for light use, maybe stacking sweaters and light cloths, not good for heavy items or toys. Also be ready to get broken pieces.I was going to exchange, but now I am going to seek refund and go with a solid unit."
4,It was nice except for,I love this product except for one thing. The drawers are soo hard to open and close. This was the only problem I have with the set. Otherwise it looks good in my dressing room. I was able to put it together in a snap! I think that the price was too high but I needed to organize badly and couldn't wait for more price comparisons. I will probably buy more cubes only if the price goes down.
1,Do not buy this,"It's overpriced. I couldn't assemble the drawers, the holes did not line up. And once everything is assembled, I coudln't put the individual pieces together so they looked like the picture. That is that the pieces had gaps in between them.I say that this is worth no more than $40; I should have just gone to Ikea."
3,Pretty Good,"The boxes arrived in great shape, however some of the panels had cracks/scratches/dents that weren't bad enough to try and return. The modules were easy to put together, though the roller-bars for the drawers were extremely hard to insert because the pre-drilled holes were a bit off, resulting in the drawers not gliding as well as they should. There was also some missing hardware, but call to the number provided in the instructions went to an actual person who took the info and sent out a new bag of hardware that I received within 10 days. All in all an okay system that is a decent buy for the $$."
3,ok but not for the money,"does its job but not for the money.paid 150,this product should caost around 80 dollars.i dont think i will be buying furnuture from amazon again.i seen something at ikea that would of been just as good and it only cost 89 dollars"
2,not so good,Only getting 2 stars because my daughter likes it. It won't stand up or stretch out. Not as quality as the original. Would not buy again!
1,Very Disappointed,"The retro-slinky dog, however cute, just doesn't work. We have tried it on the hardwood floor, the carpet, the title. We have tried tying a string arounds it's neck, adding a string to it's short stubby string, using the short stubby string to pull it but nothing works. Our kids 2 & 6 just drag it around laying on it's side--it's just not fun--the head is too heavy and it doesn't move well at all. I would not buy it. the Fisher Price doggy we got is very cute and it stays upright, it walks with you and the pull-string is a good length--plus it's cute too!!"
2,Slinky Dog,Purchased as a Christmas present for my 4 year old grandson. Very poor quality. I think it will fall apart after a few uses.
5,Great toy,This toy is durable fun and great for children who love the toy story movies. My 2 year old son loves this toy
3,It's nice,"I really like it, but the only thing that i do not like is the string is attached in between the eyes and there's some scratches on top of the nose. probably something was removed and tried to polished it. otherwise; it's a very nice toy and my son loves it"
1,Get something else,What a waste of money. My son who got this for his 3rd birthday and loves his regular pull dog toy and loves all the Toy Story movies looked at this pulled the incredibly short string and then said I could have it. He never wanted it back.
5,Happy camper!,My son loves Toy Story and loves this toy. It's surprisingly durable - he totes it about (and occasionally drops it) and it's still fine. What more could you ask for?
2,NOT A PULL-TOY,"This would be ok for a younger child. However, the ""pulling string"" is so short that you can NOT pull it AROUNG on any type of floor.The item is very hard to stand up on its 2/4 paws*..making it frustrating for a child to try to play with it.My son had ""interest"" in this one for about ten minutes until he got so aggravated with trying to just stand it up that he threw it into his toy box and has NOT. Tried it since Christmas morning.I would suggest this toy for a child from 1-3 years old ONLY... As it would only disappoint older children."
4,Slinky Dog is the real thing,"The dog is not the slinky dog from toy story but in fact, the authentic ""slinky dog""."
5,Great.,He loves the Dog. I has very happy to find him. Since Toy Story was out 10 years ago I did not thing i would ever find Slink my Grandsons favorite.
4,Too cute to not have!,"Because of the price I almost passed up Slinky dog. I'm glad I decided to buy him because he's so cute and a lot of fun. The wheels on his feet roll nicely, there's a spring like device that connects from 1 end of his body to the other so the slinky body can only be stretched out so far, making it more durable. Definitely worth having!"
4,toy story fanatics!!,"My boys are a little obsessed with toy story, so I was so glad to be able to find slinky dog. They are in LOVE!! It says that it's the collector's edition, even comes with a little note. I would have loved to have kept one for that purpose, but toys were meant to be played with. They are loving it as an addition to their already sizable toy story collection. If you have a toy story fan, you won't be disappointed in this purchase!"
2,You have to really love Slinky Dog,"My 3.5 year old son is obsessed with Toy Story. He has wanted every character from the movies and when he wanted Slinky Dog, at first we bought this one from Target. I have to say this is one of the more annoying toys we have ever purchased. It's loud and cumbersome for him to play with. We ended up returning it to Target and purchasing the smaller version of this toy from Amazon. Not only was the scale much better (this Slinky Dog is HUGE and CLUNKY) but he liked the smaller one much better. It is the only time in his life he has ever let me return one of his toys. The durability of either of these toys isn't great. Much like a normal slinky. Expect kinks and bending etc. I recommend getting the smaller one. Cheaper and does the job for you Toy Story lover."
1,Received only the spring,"I ordered this toy because my son loves all Toy Story characters, but for my surprise we didn't get the dog... we got just the spring!"
4,Great for kids of all ages,My daughters love playing with slinky dog and all their other Toy Story characters. The package came on time as well which I appreciate.
5,Great toy for kids!,"The item was in perfect condition as described! My daughter says it was awesome and that she love it!! Super fast delivery also, recommend it to anyone! But have in mind that this toy needs a little patience to handle so would be better if it is for children 5 or older."
3,Fast shipping,I would have preferred that this shoe were wider and leather not a suede. Otherwise this was a great buy.
5,Filia,This product arrived very quickly. I tried them on and they are true to size. I love the features of this shoe and it is very nice addition to my shoe collection. Will buy filia again.
5,aw-some kicks,these are aw-some kicks they are very comfortable and i get a whole lot of positive reactions on them
3,Really big...,"These belly button ring is cute but it is very very large so it sticks out pretty far from my stomach. I thought the two balls would rest against my kin, but they literally stick out like an inch."
3,"Good, but there are better books on the subject.","I enjoyed reading this book. It is a good overview of self-publishing and written in a light, ""easy-to-read"" style. If you really wanted to learn to self-publish however, there are better books out there. What this book lacks is some of the detailed information that is available in other book on this subject. If you really want to learn to self-publish, check out the books by Poynter, Ross & Ross, Brownstone or Cordoza. Unfortunately you really need to purchase a couple of these book to really learn what you need to know. I haven't found one of that covers everything in sufficient detail."
4,A Good Overview,"Linda Foster Radke's book ""The Economical Guide to Self Publishing"" is a must read for all self publishers. It is easy to read, clear, provides a good step-by-step overview and gives great suggestions on how to save money. My only regret is that her book became available after I self published my book. Along with the books of Dan Poynter and Tom and Marilyn Ross her book has become a welcome addition to my library."
4,A Good Place to Start,"I found the video to be a good introduction to the many aspects of Tai Chi Chuan, including some push hands and martial applications. The form is Yang but is not the 37 move form so popular in the US. The instruction is good and you can follow the moves however, no video can replace a good teacher."
1,Disappointing,"Besides being overly obvious in the suggestions, some or many of the activities will only be appropriate for a particular age & season. If your baby is not the right age in that season, then you won't be able to complete the activities. The artwork is nice, and it does provide some sections to fill out with your memories of the activities. I'm glad I only paid about $1 for this book. I'll probably freecycle it."
1,"SamDUNG, why so fuzzy?","I've had this monitor for three weeks and tried adjusting everything. I must say I'm VERY dissapointed in this monitor, especially as some PC magazine reviews (perhaps bought by SamDUNG) were so positive, which led me to buy this in the first place.I should have tried the one I bought instead of justthe store display model but if I can't fix this soon I'm going to bring it back and exchange it for a Philips or NEC or something. Not happy at all!"
4,feeling this here,pure heat also feeling the way mack took that old sample from a taste of honey's boogie oogie oogie.
4,Good Sticker,"Great product. SHOPZEUS goes above and beyond when it comes to customer satisfaction. I would highly recommend this item, and all other items sold by SHOPZEUS. Thank you once again customer service."
2,Not as good as expected,Glad it was only 1:39 It was hard to follow and kind of boring. Characters were not well developed. Not one of Ellen Pompeo's best.
4,Love the action!,"I enjoyed the movie a lot, for me it was really well done and I love Ellen Pompeo so her parts were more than amazing, perhaps it is quite predictable but it still had me on the edge of my seat till the very end, I strongly recommend watching it!"
3,"Catherine wonders if Vincent is ""the bad guy""","A vigilante reported to have beast-like features is on the prowl in New York's subway trains. Catherine has suspicions the vigilante may be Vincent. There is some interesting interaction between Vincent and Catherine very early in their relationship, as Catherine doesn't seem to be fully comfortable with him (this was the 2nd episode to be broadcast). The ""villain"" in this episode is a little more complex and interesting than most.In 1998 I conducted a poll among Beauty and the Beast fans asking them to rate the 44 episodes of the first two seasons on a 1-to-10 scale. 31 fans participated. ""Terrible Savior"" finished 40th out of the 44 episodes.I placed ""Terrible Savior"" 35th in my own personal 1-through-44 rank-ordering of the episodes."
5,"Beauty and the Beast, Episode 2: Terrible Savior",An excellent movie witch peaked my interest even more in this series.
4,Good guitar,"Overall this album is pretty good, but it seems a little repetitive in spots late in the album. The first track blew me away, but then by the end it was getting older. Shredding guitar work by Mr. Impellitteri, but this album isn't as good as some of his other efforts."
3,Cd purchase,"Although the CD was stated as ""new"" and was received in a plastic cover, it had a surface scratch all the way through from one side to the other. However, the scratch did not cause the cd to skip or to not play."
3,Not bad,"Arrived quickly and is bright. Would like to have more of the reflecting ""tape"" and the zipper seems a little cheap, but it'll do the job."
3,Overpriced,"I bought 2 of these vests for about $26 each. They a nice lightweight vests, but way overpriced. Later I spotted vests equally as good at Wal-Mart for $9.00 each."
4,Fuelbelt High Visibility Reflective Vest,This is a nice Visibility Safety Vest for riding at night. Has plenty of stripes to be seen. Cheap too.
1,Good service,I received this item in good shape and very quickly. I'm upgrading the safety equipment in my car and this is an asset
3,sacrifice efficiency for looks,I am 5 7 and i should of gone for the large size. the Small size rides up as soon as you hunch over. its a good product not super great. the material is kinda cheap and the logos look kinda lame. visibility is not nearly as good as those exaggerated neon yellow vest though.
3,Reflective but low quality fabric,"The reflective stripes on the vest are undoubtably reflective. A friend once took a picture of me with the vest on at night with a flash camera and I came out as a big white blob due to the reflection. Another benefit is that it is very light weight and can be easier stuffed into a laptop bag or briefcase if needed. However, less than a year of owning the vest, the seams are already coming apart. I have never used the pocket in the back but are skeptical it would hold up to much weight."
3,"Good reference book, but lacks good pictures.",Was looking for a book that showed the different spur and saddle manufacturers and pictures showing where maker marks were. Pictures were very basic and not clear.
1,A Poor Book About an Increasingly Obscure Filmmaker,"Big Bosoms and Square Jaws is a biography of Russ Meyer whose claim to fame is that he was one of the very few individuals who rose from making porno flicks to making big budget Hollywood movies such as ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"" and ""Faster Pussycat, Kill, Kill!"" These movies were once fairly popular, but have become increasingly forgotten and Meyer's movies have invariably fared poorly in the VHS & DVD markets.Big Bosoms and Square Jaws is a book that falls short of the mark. It is one of those ""quickie"" books that takes only a superficial look at its subject. There is little on how Meyer was able to pull off the feat of going from the professional disgrace of the porno flick racket to becoming a big budget Hollywood filmmaker. Nor is there much on Meyer's relationship with Roger Ebert and Meyer's role in Ebert's becoming a big shot movie critic. There really is not much in the line of meat in this book, despite its high price tag."
3,The Coldest Blood,"Mr. Dryden created an ice covered atmosphere. The plot was interesting, but I found the novel, just too long."
1,Mislabeled item,"This is a 40GB ""B"" case. I don't know if the item is mislabeled intentionally or not, but you can't see what it is until you open the clam shell packaging. Unless your ipod has the speaker port in the center rather than the side, do not buy this case.As the packaging mine came in was covered with years of grime, I suspect the seller is intentionally swapping the product because it's not worth the effort to return. I know that's my situation. I only paid $7 and rec'd free shipping, so I won't return it, but I also won't order any further ipod products through Amazon."
1,"take Steven F. Bryant ""sfbryant"" seriously",I read Bryant's review and still decided to buy this case. BIG MISTAKE!!! I have to have my ipod sent for repairs now for the same reason as him. The ipod does not connect to the computer properly and it will not turn off or reset. I would much rather have scratches on my ipod. I do not recommend this product; spend some time to research a good case.
1,DO NOY BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I made the mistake of buying the iSkin. The opening for the docking port does not exactly match the firewire connector, so you do not get a complete connection. Now my docking port no longer works properly. I can't connect to iTunes. My iPod won't even do a reset now. As a result of purchasing this product my iPod is on the way back to Apple for repair. AVOID THIS PRODUCT AT ALL COSTS."
1,Horrible Quality,"I think this is perhaps one of the worst-built 35mm cameras ever made. My friends and family bought these cameras, used them a year or two, they die and so they would bring them to me for repair. Usually problems are from really poor quality cold soldering on the zoom or autofocus circuits, a bad chip, or the whole circuit board is toast. Thank heavens Minolta's out of the camera biz now, I don't have to fix 'em anymore."
5,Not to be Missed,"Each story in Forget Me Knots...from the Front Porch is told with such vivid detail that the authors' memories jump right out from the pages. They are warm, fuzzy, and poignant all at the same time. Every story is the perfect length to enjoy at bedtime or lunchtime. This is one book not to be missed."
5,Beautiful and Heart Warming,"Forget Me Knots..from the Front Porch is a charming collection of stories that takes the reader for a delightful trip to yesteryear. When all is said and done, all that we really have are our memories. We are a collection of thoughts, feelings and remembrances formed throughout our lifetimes. Helen Polaski and the authors of the stories in Forget Me Knots remind us of these precious gifts we carry with us in our hearts and minds. Once you've read it, Forget Me Knots..from the Front Porch is a book you'll always cherish."
5,Heartwarming & Unforgettable!,"Forget Me Knots From The Front Porch is one of the most touching and memorable collections of stories I've ever read. Filled with different voices from around the globe, it's the type of book that becomes more of an experience than a simple read. I strongly suggest, however, that each story be absorbed and then savored before moving on. Trying to read ""Forget Me Knots"" in a single sitting would be like trying to live your entire life in a single day. Poignant and masterful, I recommend this book to anyone who dares to connect with the spirits of a boatload of talented writers!"
4,Perfect addition to any hone emergency kit.,"The Stormtracker is a great multi funtion tool which should be in everyone's survival pack. The unit can run either off of 3 AAA batteries, or it can be powered via the built in hand crank dynamo. The NOAA weather Alert feature allows you to keep the unit in a standby mode while under battery power. While in standby mode, the unit will start to 'beep' when there is a severe weather warning in your area.We recently were hit by severe thunderstorms, tornados and massive flooding. Our power was out, and the Stormtracker was our lifeline. We used it to keep our cell phone charged as well as listened to the weather reports as the storm was passing over us.My one complaint about the unit is that it lacks a place to store the cell phone adapters. A small storage compartment would have been nice."
3,tube cover,The cover is ok. After having to modify (ream out ) the hole for the clevis pin so it would fit.
2,Disappointing and defective,"1) looks great and arrived well packed, but on close inspection, all details are cheaply made (knobs and drawers), giving the impression that it is not a quality product2) certain features I expected are absent, like an external speaker outlet and bass enhancer3) the internal speakers are adequate but tinny, and not being able to use a line out prevents the possibility of using higher performance external speakers4) auto shutoff on the cassette player, at least my unit, only works in play mode, not fast forward or rewind5) CD part of unit is actually defective: will not advance to next track or return to a previous one6) record player works but speed selector options are too small to read, and the sound is marginal"
3,"Play Ball, Amelia Bedelia is the best book.","Play ball, Amelia Bedelia reminded me of when the my team the Yankaes almost got beat but we won. I really liked this book."
4,Great Baseball Book,"I came across this book while looking for books about baseball for my preschooler. Not much to choose from in this niche market, but this book is a hit! My son thinks it's funny when Amelia Bedelia ""steals the bases"" and ""runs home"". Wish there were more books like this!"
5,"Play Ball, Amelia Bedelia","Amelia Bedelia is hilarious. She steals a base and she grabs the base and starts to run. She is a backwards person, she always gets confused. And she does whatever comes up to her mind. I think you will enjoy reading this funny, fantastic book.-- Jack, Age 6"
4,Manfred Mann Watch,"Very good,diverse titles, great musicianship here.Especially ""drowning on dry land"".This song makes blinded by the light seem weak. If they re-issue, jump on it. Excellent guitar work.Lost this and all in flood, Irreplaceable!"
5,Manfred Mann Still Rocks Dont Matter Any Album.,"I Have Manfred Mann ALL Albums On CD, Starting from 1964 Till Today New Album called 2006 These Guys Have Unique Way of Singing and play there Instruments. But One thing i still Miss it Old Vinyl's 33's Nothing can beat there sound Quality but offcourse hard to find if you find it buy it its worth it for this kind of Music if you are into AfroRock Get OSIBISA those guys are ANOTHER Masterpiece in old Music like Manfred Mann but osibisa Plays Afro Rock you have to hear it to feel it. Good Luck.........Ron"
4,Very cute photos and rhymes,"Was looking at multiple Kim Anderson books as gift. Opted not to buy as another more clearly expressed what it was that I wanted to get across, but none the less a nice book. The rhymes were cute, as were the photographs."
5,"Obscure, humorous, catchy","I picked up this album back in the 80s and have carried it around as a musical treasure, always dismayed by the fact that I couldn't get the CD - I'm not one of those vinyl fans, I've always wanted to hear these songs without all the ""warmth"" and the popping and crackling of my record. It's difficult to describe this music...the humor in the songwriting reminds me somewhat of Barenaked Ladies and I suppose the music is perhaps ancestral as well. It really just good, clean fun with a musical style that will appeal widely. An excellent choice for exploring something a bit off the beaten path."
4,"Polsa has no fear, 'cause he got a lot of beer","This was a very funny dark comedy murder mystery... thing. Not great, but very good; I got the chance to see it at the 2004 Seattle International Film Festival and bought it imported not long after. If you're a fan of The Usual Suspects, Pulp Fiction, Scarface, etc., it's similar to those except a comedy. Enjoy."
2,Save your money,I fast forwarded through most of this movie and didn't miss a thing. All I can say is the stars must have needed the cash. I give it two stars because Michael Nyqvist looks awesome in black leather.
1,???????,"When I started to watch the DVD, the first thing I did was watch the deleted scenes. After a few minutes, I was acutely aware that a lot of scenes had been deleted. So I proceeded to watch the movie proper. About 30 minutes later, I came to the conclusion that they should have deleted even more scenes. Perhaps all of the scenes?I then stopped the DVD, removed it from my player, and put it back in the Netflix return envelope. I then went to the Netflix website and posted pretty much what I've written here.Right now I'm thinking of a movie from the early 80s entitled ""Student Bodies"". It didn't make a lot of sense, but it was OK. At least it was amusing.My take on ""Slim Susie"" is that, after 30 minutes, it didn't make a lot of sense either, but I didn't find it even remotely amusing.It just isn't my idea of a good movie. Maybe it's yours?Slim Susie"
3,Good for bedtime...,"This movie is nice and fairly low-key so it is perfect for settling down at night. If your child likes animals alot, this is a good buy. Otherwise, it's kind of boring."
2,the animal train,"I purchased this video because it's producers were the same as The Bear, however I was very disappointed. I expected it to have the same calm feeling and lovely music. It did not; the music was irritating and incongruous, and the characters spoke in ""yelling voices"" during all conversation. For children who are used to mainstream television and video games, this may be a pleasant film, but for children and their parents who view movies like The Snowman, Beatrix Potter's Tales, etc. as their regular diet, this film is not appropriate. I gave it 2 stars only for being politically correct in it's view of endangered animals."
2,Cute Mouse Pad,"The gel does support my wrist, but my optical mouse had trouble with the slick purple mouse pad. It is cute though :)"
1,$120.00??,"According to the other comments, there is apparently some false promotion happening with the photo.....And seriously, is there gold in it or something? Why on earth is a mousepad $120??"
5,Highly recommended,"This film is beautifully made. With just a small understanding of Communist Romania, a viewer can really enjoy the creativity in telling this story. The main character is a strong heroine, but the characters around her add a lot of entertainment and give ground for reflection. I like that the film focuses on a neighborhood with its share of normal problems, while in the background communist control is falling apart."
1,Never received it!!!!!,I purchased this product over a month ago and it never made it to my home but I am now requested to make a review ????
4,Purchased as a gift.,"The person I bought this gift for says that he thought it was great. One never knows how sincere such comments really are. But he is into tractors, so hopefully it was a sincere comment."
5,Tuna cooking,"Recipes include tuna biscuit roll, camp tuna and rice, tuna romanoff, bbq tuna-taters, sorta souffle, tuna a la king, tuna surprise, plum tuna, hawaiian tuna, rosemary's pulao, tuna quiche, tuna pie, tuna stuffed potatoes, tuna st. jacques, tuna-noodle casserole and much more. 155 ways to serve America's favorite sea food."
4,Good Cheap Coat,"I bought this for a Halloween costume, the price and quality are spot on. This is perfect for that scary murdering hitchhiker look. The leather patterns are a bit weird, but the coat is so dark no one should really notice. If the smell is too much, put fabreze or colon on it. They work fine. Buttons are a bit weak. The quality of leather is beyond the price. I dragged the coat in dirt and mug to give it that old dirty worn look. I even ran over it with my car a few times and it's held up nicely. Also typical leather aging techniques will not damage the coat. Just be gentle and patient. If you are looking for a Martix style coat. this is not for you. If you are in the hunt for one, then you have to buy the real thing and give up an arm and a leg. Fakes are easy to spot, and frowned upon."
4,didn't fit right,"The quality of construction and materials was so nice. And yes, like others reviews, it has a good, not too heavy, weight to it. However, it just didn't fit right. I'm also athletic build/pear shaped. I bought both the small and medium to try both and send the one that didn't fit back."
3,something is wrong with the sizing,"This coat is absolutely beautiful. However something is wrong with the sizing. I ordered the medium. The top of the coat is so incredibly small across the shoulders, chest and high waist."
2,Not money well spent.,"Im not very happy with this product. When i got it i was so excited because it was my first new coat in a long time. But then i put it on.......after about two hours of wearing it, all of the buttons fell off. Then, even the buttons in the cuff straps fell off. Im very disappointed."
2,long leather coat,"I cannot say I am very pleased with the quality of this jacket. it is very thin and flimsy in areas, eg...the belt loop broke within 2 times of wearing it, the underarms are very thin leather, and the sleeves are not the same length. Product was delivered on time as promised. I may give this seller one more shot"
2,quality,"I like the look and feel of the coat. I ordered a 3x but it definitely runs large, which is good for layering. the one i received had some quality issue with seams and loops coming un-stiched and buttons coming off after only a few days. We will see if this is just with this one product or overall, and how well the return on defective product is"
4,THIS COAT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE JOHN SHAFT!!,"THIS PRICE I BOUGHT THIS COAT FOR WAS A NICE STEAL TO HOME PLATE!!! IT'S NICE AND WARM, AND THE ONLY GRIPE I HAVE ABOUT IT IS IT HAS SOME WEAR TO IT. BUT THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED FOR THE PRICE, I GUESS. OTHERWISE I'M WELL PLEASED WITH IT AND IT ARRIVED IN A TIMELY MANNER. I'M GLAD I GOT IT BEFORE IT WENT OUT OF STOCK."
1,It's on ebay for $9.99,"Don't be fooled by the price. This comes out of a wholesaler called bnfusa.com who do drop-shipping. The same trench coat is $10-20 on ebay, plus another $20 for shipping."
4,Up in the air,"I was spectical at first but when the jacket arrived i was pleasantly supprised by the quality. However, I did notice that the buttons needed to be tightend by needle and thread. Which my girlfriend took care of. The stitching on the belt loop hole will need to be reinforced but for the price what do you expect. Its a good looking jacket with lining. It kept me warm in Ny as I made a trip from Fl. I'm going to send it to a seamstress to fortify the loop hole and perimeter of the jacket which will cost a little more but its worth it. It may cost me 40-50 buck for the work to be done but this jacket is quality and should last for many years going forward. The leather was a good grade not cheap. All in all it was more than i expected. The buttons becoming loose was the main issue ."
5,Leather overcoat for $38.49 delivered,"Length:: 2:52 MinsI read each and every review prior to ordering this coat. They made me somewhat skeptical of buying it. Once I received the coat and opened it, all my fears were cast aside. It is a great looking coat. Very well made for the money. Fully lined with an inside pocket. I hope you can understand me in my video. I don't think there is a ""Rosetta Stone Hillbilly Edition""."
1,Smells horrible!,"WE had to hang the coat in the garage for over a month and still smells like enbalming fluid or some other toxin. Fit is alright, (not the best example of tailoring skills). Appears to be bottom grain leather, not top grain. Over all, I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,WORST COMPANY EVER!!!,"Ordered from Price Pros (Ripoff Pros) on November 4, 2012. They said I would receive it between November 8, 2012 and November 14, 2012. There policy says they will Notify you of any shipping delays which is hard to do when they don't put a tracking number on it. I sent these people an email with no response back, never called after reading the many 1/5 star reviews of people who did call, glad I'm not the only one. Bless Amazon for giving me a gift card credit to get products from others who actually know how to ship. The leather trench I ordered was 42.00 and is a great product because I ordered from someone else and got it so still order the coat, just not from this company."
5,Really great coat for an unbelievable price!,I really look forward to wearing this coat to church on cold Sunday mornings! It looks great & will be the first long warm coat that I've had in forever!
3,a nice read,"Written in Cadell's typical style, this book concerns Kerry, a single woman who's sent by her crabby boss to deliver a package to a woman in France. She arrives at the woman's house, and discovers the woman is her mom, who she hasn't seen since she was a toddler. Although the ensuing romance isn't quite believable, it's nonetheless a charming book and an easy read."
3,Just OK,"These covers are nice, but not exactly what I was looking for. I am keeping them because they do the job and fit well."
4,stove top covers,I was very happy with the quality of the stove top coversthey are well constructed does the job of covering the burners well
4,Great book but a little disappointed,"The book was great. I would recommend it to anybody. BUT, I thought I was buying a new book and it was an old library book. I may have misread the details or they just weren't explained throughly. The book was received very quickly. Thanks"
3,"Great Book, But.....","Great book if you are doing a reef study and need to identify the correct names for all the creaters. Great photo's and helpful hints on purchasing equipment, but for the average weekend or resort snorkeller it can get boring to read. However, the book is worth having."
1,Not Good Quality,Picture was jumpy and headache inducing. It could not be stabilized with the tracking and was completly unwatchable.
5,"Excellent, lasts along time","I don't use tapes too much anymore, since the advent of DVR recorders. I do have friends that don't have a DVR's therefore I copy things for friends. Maxell makes a good tape for this purpose."
5,VHS Tape,"We have a dual VHS/DVD player and I like using VHS tapes for temporary taping. I find they are more user friendly. VHS tapes do not seem to be on store shelves anymore so I am glad I can find them on-line. I purchased the Maxell hgh grade because they seemed to be the best buy. I have taped, and overtaped repeatedly and they perform very well."
1,Definitey NOT a children's CD,"I bought this CD for my kids. The music is all done by unknown adult singers and not a children's CD. If you can imagine some guy that kinda sounds like Elvis singing Barry White's song ""Can't Get Enough of Your Love, Baby""... Well... it's actually hilarious. These are just BAD remakes of the original songs. Don't waste your money. In the past when I have bought a children's album, the songs were at least sung by children, which made the CD more age appropriate. Look somewhere else for children's music."
3,Skip this - buy the UK remastered version,"This is a wonderful record, probably the best Love & Rockets album ever. But this CD edition was mastered around 1987, and sounds thin and faded - it has no bass punch. Spend the extra cash and buy the UK remastered import. You'll get all of these tracks plus a great cover of Syd Barrett's ""Lucifer Sam."" The UK version sounds much sharper, revealing bass lines you'll never notice with this thin edition. Still, if you're on a budget, this is a marvelous album regardless."
3,Sounds best from start to finish,"When this album came out, Ball of Confusion became my favorite song. Boy was I surprised when I heard the song at a Temptations concert with my parents. Now, a little older, a little smarter, this version sounds somewhat silly compared with the power of the soulful original. However, this album still sounds great, particularly in headphones. It moves nicely from start to finish, covering lots of sonic territory. While most will listen for nostalgia these days, it still sounds fresh enough for newcomers."
3,suprised,"I bought this for ""well have a nice day"" and was surprised when I heard a disco classic on here."
4,NICE,NICE SWEET GIORGIO ARMANI FOR WOMEN I DO NOT LIKE DEALING WITH ANY OTHER PRODUCT BUT THIS ONE FEMALE GIO. I WILL GET MORE SOON I LIKE IT. PEACE & LOVE
5,Great fragrance!,I absolutely love this perfume. Wish it wasn't so expensive and hard to find. Very tropical scent. I'm always asked what the name of my perfume is.
3,Not so much . . .,"I purchased these frisbees after reading other reviews. However, they have not really outperformed others. Our dog, a 5-yr old GSP, is not a big chewer, but loves to pick them up by the middles. They are now donuts. I really expected more than two months -- we do not use them every day, but probably 5 out of 7 days for about 20 minutes. For the price, I am somewhat disappointed."
3,Ok for about a month,"Worked great for about a month, using it once or twice a week. Our dog like to play tug, and it eventually ripped in half."
2,Expensive and easily destroyed,"This would be a good purchase if it were either less expensive or more durable. It is advertised as ""very durable and puncture resistant,"" but our german shepherd tore it up pretty quickly just in normal use -- i.e., catching and retrieving it. We didn't let the dog chew on the toy when he wasn't playing with it, but even so it only lasted about two weeks. For $15 I expected more."
3,"Marginal, at best","Three stars might be a tad generous. Yes it's soft and light so it's easy on the dogs' mouths, but they never get their mouths on it because it really can't be thrown very far, at least by me. When I first got it and threw it, they'd be long past the place where it fell, thinking it was actually going somewhere. Now when they see me pick it up, they look bored and hope I'll just get a different disc. One that flies. This one has lousy aerodynamics. Most reviewers claim it flies well, so maybe it's me, but I have other discs that I can send really well and far (Jawz disc is best). This one I can throw maybe 50 feet on a good throw, which is fairly pathetic. So just a heads-up that majority opinion does not guarantee your own satisfaction. Personally, I highly recommend the Hyperflite Jawz Disc (at Amazon), which is easy to fly really well and far."
2,A Flop that Floats,"I just bought an Easy Glider Max for my GS but I must say that I am very dissapointed. This Dog frisbee is really too heavy to fly well. The only good thing I find about it is that it floats. I can give more excersise to my dog by throwing sticks than by this foam frisbee. If you want a frisbee that can fly, this is not a good choice."
5,GREAT FOR PLAYING IN THE SNOW!,"If you still want to play fetch with your dog during the winter months in Alaska(or anywhere with deep snow) and not lose balls or the hard plastic frisbees in the snow this is the toy for you and your dog! It's light and won't get hard in the cold, it stays on top of the snow so your dog can still run and get it."
5,Great toy,"Looking at this frisbee, it appears that it would be destroyed by my hard chewing goldendoodle. The dog has destroyed almost every ""indestructible"" toy I have given him. But not this frisbee! It has hundreds of tiny toothmarks, but after hours upon hours of play for the last several months, it is completely intact. He can destroy a Kong frisbee in no time at all, but somehow, this one remains in one piece. Love it."
2,Sandal Bottom,"The bottom of this sandal is very thin. I had a rubber padding put on the large area and on the heel. I even added an extra piece of rubber on the heel, as I walk hard. When I took it to the shoe repair shop, the man told me that this shoe will not last long. If you have wide feet, the toe area is slightly tight--may stretch a little. The strap toward the ankle has an adjustable buckle."
2,Good enough for the wedding,"I bought these shoes to wear at my daughters wedding and they were good enough for that (I kicked them off at the reception!), but they really aren't comfortable enough to wear frequently. I might wear them again, but probably not."
1,Does NOT directly read microSD cards,"Though listed as a reader for MicroSD, you need an adapter if you actually want to use such devices."
4,White Alligator,"It was nice of Safari LTD to introduce a representation of the white alligator, since I don't know of any other company that even makes normal alligators, let alone white. Nice addition to any collection of wild animals."
3,Seems to cause hangs sometimes,"You may not want to put a lot of stock in this review, since my wife (not I) is the main user, and I don't have a lot of details. But it seems like when Endnote is running, Word will often hang. Maybe this is specific to Intel-based machines. Maybe the problem is actually with Word; it seems to hang even without Endnote, although Endnote seems to exacerbate the problem. But we're not wild about the end result."
4,mph gradstudent,So far this seems to be a great product! A lot has changed since I was an undergrad in the days before the internet. I particularly like the way EndNote will retrieve data automatically for references from its on-line libraries. Highly recommended for any student writing a thesis or dissertation!
1,"So far, a total waste of time and money","I upgraded to Endnote X because I was hoping for more journal formats, and fewer of the bugs that plague Endnote 7. However, even after downloading updates from their website, Endnote X will not even open my older Endnote library. Since I don't have the option of manually re-entering 1,200 references, I'm back to using Endnote 7. Maybe your experience won't be as disappointing as mine, but so far the new Endnote is just as frustrating to work with as the original."
2,Wrong picture,The picture of this item is incorrect. The package I got contained two identical pieces for the top and bottom made for an aluminum column.
3,column caps,the caps were made well and sturdy. the problem was that of not taking into account that old columns expand and caps have not. broke two of the 4 while trying to install. next time I will try the jointed caps on old columns. The problem was mine not theirs.DRT
5,What a GREAT read!,"It has been some time since I read this book--around the time is first went on the bookstands--and it still has vibrations. I was compelled to write a review because 1) I was honestly looking for the authors' second book (where is it?) and 2) I was disapointed to read a few less than favorable reviews.Ms. Hague has a wonderful writing style which provides the reader with wonderfully rich characters in a romantic, historic setting.More!"
5,"Bring on Book 2, I'm willing to wait just a reasonable time!","Aubrey What a fantastic male lead for a book! I can see the movie now... Strong,virle able to hold his own in any situation.Totaly male. Very intelligent, knows went to hold back and knows when to leap into the fray. Really able to use his mind to guidehis actions and his heart. A Thinking womans lover. Now thats what I and all my friends want!. Arabella is his Perfect match. A young woman who confides her every deepest thoughful reflection to her journal and wants to gain the most freedom she can to experence in her own life. The two are bound heart and soul to find each other some how and some way in this wide world. Ms Hague has a fine start as an Author keep up the good work we await part II."
1,Sad but true,"I used to be one of the greatest fan of Whitney Houston, I didn't mind if her songs were not always beautiful 'cause she had THE VOICE, an incredible, amazing sound, but I'd be really stupid and disrespectful of her ""old"" talent if wouldn't say that she has lost something. She still knows how to ""move"" her voice but it sounds really different, it's so powerless and it makes me sad as a fan and mostly as a listener. You can realize what I'm saying listening to ""Joy to the world"" and ""Who would imagine a king"" that she has recorded years ago for the soundtrack of her movie ""The preacher's wife"", and where her voice is at her best. After those two songs go back to the others and you will surely note that she is not the same. ""Little Drummer Boy"" is my favorite tracks, where Whitney's child sings (adorable), but one song cannot make an intere album...sad but true."
2,Where's Whitney?,"I have been a staunched fan eversince but even so I couldnt help but notice the big difference in her voice now. Her voice used to be crystal clear and soaring, which was still evident from the last 2 tracks in the cd that were previously recorded. She has lost the magic albeit the styles are still present.They shouldnt have added the last 2 tracks as they have become a source of comparison between Whitney Then and Whitney Now.Having said that, I want my old Whitney back..."
1,Merry Crack-mas,So Whitney put the crack pipe down long enough to make a Christmas cd. And a duet with her daughter. How so very sweet. I wish Whitney would stop acting so ghetto. This cd is a step in the right direction but it'll take more than songs about Christmas to undo all the harm she has done to her career.
1,"eh, no.","Being an enormous whitney fan I bought this album expecting to hear some of my favorite christmas classics sung by a powerful voice, but I was regretfully disappointed. She just doesn't sound like the whitney of before. Aside from her voice, the way the songs were produced did not impress me one bit. It's too R'nB for a christmas album. I had planned to buy this CD for my friends as stocking stuffers but I will definetly not be doing that. I might have to pick up celine or mariah's x-mas CD's instead."
2,Not what I expected,"Nice CD, but not what I expected. I was hoping more traditional songs in her voice, with a bit of Chritmas rythm."
5,WONDERFUL WONDERFUL WHITNEY,"I HAVE TWO CHRISTMAS CD'S THAT I PLAY OVER AND OVER, LUTHER VANDROSS AND ALEXANDER ONEIL. NOW I WILL HAVE THREE!!!!! WHITNEY IS THE VOICE. ONE WISH AND LITTLE DRUMMER BOY ARE THE BEST VERSIONS I HAVE EVER HEARD. YOU PEOPLE WHO GIVE NEGATIVE REVIEWS ARE JUST FOCUSING ON HER PERSONAL LIFE. I COULD CARE LESS. THE VOICE!!! THE VOICE!!! I DON'T KNOW OF ANY ARTIST WHO VOICE DOESN'T CHANGE. NO ONE CAN HOLD A CANDLE TO HER!!!! CAN ANY OF YOU NEGATIVE REVIEWERS SING? I CAN'T! THAT'S WHY GOD BLESSED US WITH THE VOICE!!!!!!MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY HOLIDAYS AND BUY THIS CD FOR REAL SINGING."
5,"""One Wish"" The Holiday Album Of The Year!","I think this album is great. Whitney has a very strong voice on this cd. What I love the most is how she gave the old classic life, and made a great new cut ""One Wish"" which will soon be a classic Christmas ever year around. All in all I think this album is wonderful, and a must have for the holiday cd collector! Nobody can do it like Whitney!"
5,....So Beautiful,"so Very Miss Houston, it gives her own spirited renditions of age old Christmas favorites. Her throaty contralto voice glides across the notes. The upbeat tempo makes you fell why we sing a Joyful Noise Until the Lord."
2,Disappointed,"You must like ethnic southern church sound to like this-not Whitney singing Christmas songs in a traditional style. Also, some tracks sounded muffled-like a recording of a cd from this particular source."
1,This is not good,Her powerful voice is gone and her mega hits too. I wonder why she took all these drugs and DID NOT STOP in time. Now it's too late she's gone and will NEVER come back. Retire Whitney because now I don't wanna hear your voice anymore. The songs are okay but the magical voice is gone. Please stop now before it gets VERY VERY clear that you can't sing anymore and looks like an 65 year old man. The truth hurts I know.
4,"Hilarious, given the circumstances","I'm sure Whitney & Bobby will have enough blow and coke laying around for a real ""White Christmas."" ""Let It Snow"" should also be great with flurries up her nose. The cover art is the funniest by far, how t0ked was she?"
5,Great Christmas CD!,"I'm writing this after my first listen to this cd. I enjoy every song on this cd! No tracks to ""grow"" on me, I loved it all from beginning to end. Whitney has made the classic Christmas songs fresh and wonderful to listen to. This will be one of the Christmas cd's that I'll pull out every Christmas and never tire of."
3,Cant have Christmas without her.,"Hearing Whitney at Christmastime was a good addition to my collection, however i should have chosen a cd with different songs. I wanted a Whitney CD, I will look for another."
2,One Wish: Holiday Album,"I was very disappointed with this album. From now on, I will not order any cd's unless first hearing them."
5,Lovely,"I had to actually hide this one. I let friends play it and they tried to leave it in their CD player. I guess you know I checked the case and it was empty, I politely waited for the owner to open the player and retrieve it. It is a lovely ablum all the songs were great and the quality was tood."
3,One Wish - Whitney Houston,"Purchased items for a Christmas Gift for a fan of Whitney, so I did not get to listen to the sounds. Received the item in great condition and in received it in the time that was estimated."
1,"My ""One Wish""....This CD hadn't been made.","Remembering the Whitney of yesteryear, I eagerly anticipated this CD. How shocked I was when I finally heard it. Gone are the soulful vocals...replaced by Whitney's over-singing the well known songs. When singing holiday music you needn't over sing them, which Whitney does. I was so annoyed after the first five songs, I turned it off. Her voice sounds hoarse and rough, and sadly I won't be buying, or listening to any more Whitney CD's."
1,ONE WISH???: LOTS of SNOW and A CRACK CHRISTMAS,"You don't need ""20/20"" vision to realize BMG should have never offered to extend a new contract to ""Diva Houston"". I used to be a die hard HOUSTON FAN (I even enjoyed parts of her last studio recording), however on this CD, we witness an artist slip sliding down the ""SNOW"" trail.Vocally, this CD does not present HOUSTON with a strong artistic achievement. This holiday cd is terribly cliche and a product most could live without.MARIAH released a better holiday CD in 1994 as did CELINE with her seasonal CD of 1999.The once impressive Houston now sounds frozen in time partly due to the horrid 1980's musical arangements.For your money, you would be better off purchasing the new holiday CD from HARRY CONNICK JR ~ HARRY FOR THE HOLIDAYS.One wish: EARTH TO HOUSTON ~ Get your act together it's a sin to waste a talent like yours."
4,I love this CD!!!!,"This is a wonderful Christmas cd. I'm not a music expert so I can't point out all the ""flaws"". I can only enjoy it for what it is.....a great cd. If you want something to listen to in the car or nice background music, this is it. A couple of my favorites are One Wish and O come O come Emanuel. How people can say Mariah Careys' cd is better I don't know. Even when Whitney is not at her full capacity, she is still a far better singer then most of the people out here today. Let's not judge anyone by their personal struggles but by their talent and abilities. Listen to it...and I think you will enjoy."
2,"Whitney is very talented, but this is a very annoying album...","Whitney is very talented, but this is a very annoying holiday album. There is too much back-beat on nearly every song making it sound more like a Muzaked soul album than a Christmas offering. The music kept making me feel like I was ""on hold"" waiting for technical support for something.I have over 2000 Christmas songs on my iPod.....many are truly great. Not a single song on this CD will be added to that list, which really bums me out because she has an amazing voice. I was so rooting for this to be good."
1,glissando - melisma OVERDOSE!,"Call it what you want ""glissando - n : a rapid series of ascending or descending notes on the musical scale adv : (musical direction) in the manner of a glissando (with a rapidly executed series of notes); melisma - n. pl. melismata (-m -t ) or melismas A passage of several notes sung to one syllable of text."" - the excessive use of it gets pretty darn annoying on this album. The only song of any worth on this album is the final one ""Joy to the World"" with a wonderful gospel choir backing her up. Spend 79 cents and download that one song and pass on the rest of the album. Zero stars should be an option."
1,Listerine Gargle,"I ordiarily love Ms Houston and just knew this would be a good one. Boy was I ever wrong. I honestly think this whole album was recorded in a Gas Station bath room, while gargling Listerine."
1,This just confirms Whitney's downward spiral,This album is horrible. Why her voice is still beautiful the vocal arrangements are horrid...like she hit the crack pipe before she went into the studio. This is a lazy effort with too few songs and two recycled songs from the Preacher's Wife. She needs to hire a decent producer.
2,OK but Not the wonderful voice,I know Whitney can sing but in the past couple of years she has not been up to par. One Wish is a prime example of her singing woes. Not the best but it is better then her recent past live performances.Hope Whitney can get her full voice back. She was once the best!
2,Disappointed Once Again,"I have supported Whitney ever since she dropped her first album. She USE to be one of the best vocals out there. However, this CD is just average.It's not filled with her high pitched hitting notes and several times she sounds like she is straining! Most of the songs could have been produced better. She shouldn't have recorded Freddie Jackson's christmas song, ""One Wish.""I'm so glad that I listened to this CD at a friends house before I spent my money. The project before this christmas CD had given me plenty of warning. I like to warn you!"
1,DON't BELIEVE THE HYPE!,"I would use caution when reading the reviews here. While some are legit, there are some (including this one) whose ranking means nothing. If you take a look at reviews for a lot of the Holiday CDs that have come out this year, as well as previous years, you will notice that someone (or several people) having been using the reviews to advertise for Whitney's album. It is sad. I haven't heard the album, I'll bet it is great, but I don't like the tactics her fans or her ""people"" are using. It is wrong and rather pathetic."
3,A little surprised,"I was a little surprised that I didn't take to this CD as I thought I would, but I'm thankful."
1,Are you guys NUTS???,"Wow, it looks like all of Whitney's cousins submitted these reviews. Apparently Ms. Houston-Brown just released the album of a lifetime. Well, I'm here to say that this is a HORRIBLE album that never should have been recorded. Whitney should have retired while she was ahead. Now she's just a parody of herself. Poor thing."
4,One Wish...Whitney Is On Her Way Back,"Although Whitney's performace on this CD is not as perfect as ALL of her other work, we must consider she was working with L.A. Reid, the head of Arista at the time and as with the CD Just Whitney... it is just a different kind of sound and production than what Houston usually delivers. Even on Whitney's worst day she can, AND DOES out-sing any other performer living or dead. My favorite track has to be Little Drummer Boy, I love the arrangement and Whitney Rocks. I am so glad Whitney has dumped that loser of a husband and I have no doubt she will rise to the top again. Whitney is and will always be the greatest vocalist to ever live. God has blessed her, and has blessed us with her talents. THANK YOU NIPPY!!!"
1,Oh how the mighty have fallen,"It seems the once powerful and classy woman we know as Whitney Houston has fallen even further. This album needed a different producer. Her voice sounds terrible on almost every song. I don't know if she will ever regain her ""edge"". Her career needs help, and this album is not going to help. I hope she tries again because she has so much potential."
2,A much anticipated failure.,"I was extremely excited when I realized Whitney Houston was releasing her first Christmas album. I have studied voice for years and have always considered Whitney to have exception range and depth in her music. However, the album One Wish did not represent that same old Whitney Houston. Her songs are breathy and airy. She doesn't seem to be able to maintain proper breathing technique. And I found it quite amusing how she adds her own words when she can't remember the real words. I loved Little Drummer Boy with her daughter (I would have bought a whole album of her daughter's) but then Whitney can't even let her daughter sing without adding comments in the background. The only saving grace for this album would be Joy to the World, which was recorded when Whitney filmed the movie The Preacher's Wife. My mother actually gave her album of this cd to me not knowing I too had unfortunatly bought this album. My advice is to stick with Mariah Carey's Merry Christmas album."
3,Not Perfect,"This CD is not all bad, but definately not what Whitney is (or was) capable of. As far as technical singing technique goes, her breathing is ALL OVER THE PLACE and has little to no control, whereas on her previous efforts she sang and breathed effortlessly. As far as her delivery/interpretations of the songs, they are somewhat oversung and the arrangements could be better, particularly on ""O Come O Come.."". The last two tracks are probably the best, which goes to tell you that you are MUCH better off getting ""the Preacher's wife"" soundtrack instead, where Whitney is at her best."
2,"Whitney sounds better than the ""Just Whitney"" mega flop...","but her voice is still very weak. So sad to see a living legend like her lose her voice.The only good song her is ""O Come O Come Emanuel"" the rest of the songs are nice but Whitney's raspy voice cracks to much so it's difficult to enjoy it. You are much better off with Christina's Christmas album!!!"
3,I would've bought something else...,"I am a big fan of Whitney Houston as a singer, so I had high hopes for this Christmas CD. I was so excited to receive it! When I did - I listened to all of the songs...it wasn't the same ol' Whitney from her younger years who could sing the ABC's and make that sound wonderful. She has a song in there in which she is singing with her daughter which is sweet. But overall, I was a bit disappointed. The Christmas songs on this CD are traditional so that's nice to listen to. But Whitney is not the Powerhouse singer that she once used to be. If you enjoy listening to Christmas music, then it is a good buy, but if you're expecting to hear that amazing voice of hers...it's not on this CD."
2,See what drugs do to a diva,"Now, if you have been a Whitney Houston fan since the beginning of her career, the first thing you would notice on this disc is the degradation of her voice. It sounds as though she has lost the danty fluidity which gave her voice that soft yet powerful strength during the 90s. Similarly, there are instances where it sounds as though it is such a struggle for her to belt the high notes. The deepening and hoarsening of her voice are likely due to 1. her drug use and 2. general vocal stress over the years.Of course, the disc is not entirely disappointing. Luckily, Joy to the World and Who Would Imagine a King were barrowed from the Preacher's Wife soundtrack to give listeners a taste of her voice when it was in top form."
3,A Holiday Joy,"This is a good (average) Christmas cd by Whitney Houston. But something tells me had she did this cd 10 years ago, it would have been much better than this one. Don't get me wrong, this cd is a hella lot better than her last nightmare called ""Just Whitney"". But I feel something is lacking with this one. I really loved the song she did with her baby Bobbi Christina. That is a nice song. I hope this is a sign that Whitney is getting better...Let me also recommend Mariah Carey's classic ""Merry Christmas"", Vanessa William's beautiful ""Star Bright"" and Whitney's last great cd ""The Preacher's Wife"" soundtrack. But get Whitney's ""One Wish: The Holiday Album"", too."
1,Christmas songs,I was hoping this would be as clear and perfect as her version of the National Anthem--I was disappointed and will recycle it.
5,A very good Christmas CD,We have several Christmas CDs. This one is by far one of the better Christmas CDs. This is not just your normal re-hashed Christmas music. This cd is funky and has a great gospel sound. This is a must buy!
2,poor whitney,"well, i know several people who purchased this cd and they all returned them. i listened to it saying it couldnt be that bad..well it kinda was. the only really good songs where the two from THE PREACHERS WIFE soundtrack. those where recorded when she still had a great voice. once again the new songs find her reaching and screetching for notes that at one time were effortless for her. ive read some of the reviews here and wonder what cd did some of these people listen to. i guess those are the die hard mrs. brown fans who refuse to believe that she has lost it."
2,One Wish for Whitney,"If this album had been released 10 years ago--before all the drug-induced damage to her voice--I would have snatched it up in a second. But now, I will pass on it. Whitney used to have the most wonderful, angelic, glorious voice I had ever heard. Even now, almost 20 years after her debut album, I can't think of anyone whose voice was as angelic.But now, her voice sounds old and raspy--and it is too depressing to even listen to her anymore. The saddest part about this story, is that she did this to herself.All the great reviews of this CD are undoubtedly from die-hard fans who cannot face the truth about Whitney. Oh well, ignorance is bliss, I guess."
5,UPLIFTING AND TIMELESS....,"Whitney's SENSATIONAL & SIGNATURE interpretation of these uplifting and timeless songs is a WONDERFUL holiday gift we should ALL be thankful to experience! Aside from ""anything"", we should be thankful she's ALIVE and here with us to deliver what the Creator has instilled inside of her. Each song is BETTER THAN well-delivered, giving us something we didn't have; and (perhaps) giving us something we REALLY need. And not simply the ""songs"", but the ""song-GIVER""...which should give all of us HOPE for this holiday season! Thank you kindly, Ms. Houston, for such a BEAUTIFUL gift!!!"
3,bittersweet,"What happened to Whitney's voice? She sounds so low and hoarse. The only song that really soars is Who Would Imagine A King? from The Preachers Wife which was done years ago. If you loved Whitney then it's bittersweet listening to the this album. It's like looking the ruins of a palace and wondering what happend.On the plus side, Whitney does make do with what voice she has left and this album has more 100 times more style and warmth than Ahsanti's Christmas effort."
3,"Good, but I expected more","Whitney Houston has been blessed with a remarkable voice, and I was excited to see a Christmas album from her. She is, without a doubt, one of the most talented singers ever, but I agree that her voice is not up to par. I expected her to belt out every song, especially ""O Holy Night."" You NEED a voice like hers to sing that song, but it just didn't get there. Not like ""I Will Always Love You"" and other songs that sent a chill up my spine when she would hit those notes - which are few in this album. It seems the songs are purposely softer for that reason. I enjoyed her take on some, but expected more of the classic versions."
3,Good to hear Whitney sing...!!!,"I am so glad that Mrs. Houston-Brown is still in the game. I have admired the entire family: Cissy, Dee Dee, Dionne (of course) and Ms Missy (Whitney, that is!)While it may be disheartening to know about her trials and tribulation, I am certainly glad that Whitney STILL SOUNDS GOOD. My hope is that there will be different producers on the next project, just to mix it up a bit, ya' know??!!This is a great cd to get the family in the mood for the holiday's. When ordering, keep in mind that while nothing lasts forever, class and style are never lost. And this ""Holiday"" album is proof of that!!!! Thanks God that there are still singers that make music for the ""GROWN FOLKS' :-)KEEP ON GOING, WHITNEY!!!!!!!!"
3,Where is the beef,As a conservative I was hoping to see some of the light of the liberal side. Unfortunately that did not happen with this book. Wellstone never provides reasoning as to why wealth should be distributed by the government (also known as socialism). He like many liberals are far to idealistic in thinking that they can eradicate every evil from the earth.
1,Thankfully brief,"A small book as befits the title. This liberal screed equates compassion with class envy, appropriating others resources, and keeping the needy and downtrodden just that way.What a fraud."
5,"Pure goodness, from a good man!","This book says it all. Bill Bradley said it best when he said, ""Read this book and feel thankful that there is a man such as Paul Wellstone in the service of our country.""Kudos, Senator Wellstone."
1,Paul Wellstone Talking About Himself,"I went into this book expecting the liberal version of The Conscience of a Conservative. I wanted a fair defense of liberal values and ideas so that I could understand the other side of the coin. What I got instead was a bunch of Krugman talking about himself and why he thinks he's such a great person (maybe he is, but he should have instead titled the book ""Why I'm So Great""). So if you want to read a book about why Krugman is such a great person, you've found your book. But if, like me, you want to understand the support for liberal ideology, look elsewhere."
5,What a GREAT Book...,"I was a great admirer of Paul Wellstone ever since the fall of 1990. Although I have lived in Minnesota since 2001, in 1990 I was a college sophomore in another state who was writing a paper studying the 1990 elections. I follwed the 1990 Minnesota Senate race, and was pleasantly surprised when he went against the predominate ""conventional wisdom"" and scored an upset victory (he was the ONLY Democrat to defeat an incumbent that year).For someone like me, who has been quite frankly sick and tired of the right-ward drift of the Democratic Party and the ""play it safe"" convetnional wisdom, Paul Wellstone was the antidote.I enjoyed the autobiographical narrative of this book, it brought back a lot of memories. I enjoyed his frank discussion of the inner working of the US Senate, and I especially enjoyed the later chapters where he offered hope for a people-centered, progressive politics."
4,"Telescopic Extension Pole, 30'","Thirty feet is enough to reach the top of our warehouse roof, so the snow will be under control this year. Video camera will also be getting some lofty views from 30-35 feet up. Yes, as expected this is a heavy device, and strong, so it's just what we wanted. Order came fast, but apparently Amazon was not notified (maybe because this review wasn't timely?)."
3,Good overview but need to wade through the blame game,"Being the mother of an autistic son, this is one of many autism books and articles that I have read. The pages are filled with information, ideas and starting points to send you on your way. I do think it is worth a read, however the author's preaching is a bit hard to swallow at times. I know where she's coming from, so I suppose I should cut her a little slack. She often likes to make sweeping judgements and recommendations base on her personal opinions and experience. It's odd, because she tries to assert that she's taking a more scientific approach. There's also a lot of the blame game going on in this book. I suppose it's human nature, but it's a frame of mind that I try to avoid. As with many books and articles on the subject that are written by parent with autism, there is a personal agenda at work."
2,Anecdotal with a lot of grasping at straws,"The focus of the book seems to be how to try every snake oil solution first, add in a lot of prayer and then seek help from qualified ABA therapists. It is informational and a good read - for what NOT to do. Try - 'Overcoming Autism' as your first book - Lynn Koegel and Claire LaZebnik. I give it two stars since it doesn't really educate how to approach autism so much as how NOT to approach autism."
3,Facing Autism,"This book provides good information for the parents of an autistic child. However, it would have better been entitled ""Autism and the Lord"" because of all the references to religion, church, prayer and Christ. If the constant references to faith and religion don't bother you, then this book can be very helpful."
3,Good Effort,"I found interesting the ideas of this reviewer:""It gives a lot of information about autism, as relayed by a mom's story of her autistic son, Ryan. However, some of the therapies she suggests may be questionable. My autistic child may be more high functioning that hers - so some of the suggestions she makes about dietary changes/suppliments/secretin may not make sense for every family with an autistic child. Overall, a good read that gave me hope for the future.""The author means well, but her emphasis on faith over science may be the downfall, and leaves some wanting more rational solutions. She may be falling prey to some pseudo-science here."
2,Weight Loss & Pilates?,"When I heard the famous Romana Kryzanowska was going to make videos I jumped for joy! I live on the West Coast and have been fortunate enough to study with teachers who were students of Romana's.The strange thing is that I've never heard my instructors talk specifically about weight loss as related to Pilates. One day, however, I asked my teacher about this subject. She told me that tradtional Pilates should never be thought of as a weight loss strategy. That Pilates is a complete cross-training system within itself. And that if you study the classical Pilates method, then your body naturally changes and becomes slimmer as result of good form.This video is OK, but weight loss doesn't seem to be part of the traditional Pilates technique that I studied. I wonder what Joseph Pilates would think. And I wonder what Romana would think."
1,I Wish I Could Endorse This Video,"I am a certified instructor who trained with Romana Kryzanowska during the 1980s and 1990s. I revere Romana like thousands of other hard working and talented instructors. I feel we share a special bond by experiencing the Pilates method through her greatness. There is no other individual in the world (who actually trained with Joseph Pilates) who is as creative as Romana, and who preserves the true method with beautiful musicality and authenticity.Having said these things, it is seriously discouraging to know Romana is casting the Pilates method as a weight loss approach. It's hard to believe that Romana actually approved this video, and it's suggestion of weight loss through Pilates."
2,"Pilates Is Excellent, But...","I totally love Pilates and enjoy working out. I have been taking lessons with Pilates equipment because it feels so good. Because of wishful thinking, I bought this video because I'm a little overweight. And because I heard the woman featured teaches traditional Pilates. From my experience, no type of exercise can help you lose weight, because you must be eating a healthy diet---regularly. But, as I said, wishful thinking led me to buy this video.Well, I was disappointed because this seems to be yet another video that capitalizes upon our desire to loose weight. The Pilates method is great, there is no doubt about it. But this video cannot help you achieve the implied message of weight loss."
4,a wonderful dvd,I have taken numerous private sessions with Romana in New York City at Drago's Gym. These tapes were super. I felt as though Romana was in my house with me giving me a private session. They are Terrific and I highly recommend them!
1,Unrelated to Weight Loss,"I've studied Pilates at Drago's Gym where Romana Kryzanowska has taught for many years. And I've taken some lessons from Romana herself. I never heard anyone talk about Pilates that suggested it has weight loss benefits.From my understanding, Pilates was not created as a weight loss method. I'm curious why Romana Kryzanowska released a video that promotes Joseph Pilates' legacy as a way to lose weight. Romana is a one-of-a-kind teacher who embraces the brilliance of Joseph Pilates' tradition. Romana is clearly one of the most important communicators of the method.The Pilates method is awesome because it can transform your body and mind into better health overall. When Pilates is practiced properly in the original ""East Coast"" tradition (Joseph Pilates started his studio in NYC in the 1920s), you actually evolve into a more complete and satisfied human being.So, this video leaves me disappointed."
2,Buyer Beware!!!,"Just so you know, these are not the ""original hits"", most of these tracks are TJ's vocals over souped-up karaoke-type arrangements. Still, he's in great voice, and the price is right."
5,How does he do it?!?!,"I cannot believe that he has done it again! Another album that blows you away! Although, I don't think anything can match his ""Looking For Jack"" (which I keep locked up like gold because it took my almost 10 years to find again!) album, this is excellent work again!"
4,A well matched pair,Dreyfus and DiVito are perfectly pitted against each other and they portray true salesmen at their worst and best. Barbara Hershey is beguiling.
3,98 Custom,"I recently purchased this item and on the picture it has a 20oz. CO2 tank.... but that is not what you recieve, you get a 9oz. tank so buyer beware of the pictures"
5,Loved It....,"Went perfect with his Titans room ,he really like it and he uses it to warn his brother to stay out of his room......"
1,Disappointed.,"Mr. Giovinazzo, titling this book Object Oriented Data Warehouse Design is quit a stretch. True it does contain the Object Oriented buzzwords, but no real practical OO design or implementation information. A better title would have been 'Introduction to Data Warehousing' but then this would just be remake of a hundred other books already available on that subject."
3,If your looking for a refrence book this is NOT it!,"I purchased this book in the hope that I could use it as a refrence as well as a tutorial for using the Gnat compiler. It failed in both cases. Don't get me wrong, This is a good book if you have time to read it cover to cover. I do not! Further, the book never goes into much depth about the copiler and most of the data on the disk was unaccessable. My conclusion is that if this is your first time with Ada and you have time to spare this book is for you. Every one else should look else where."
4,Great fun but lacking in quality.,"I love Starblazers and to have them on DVD is a wish come true. I have the entire original ""Iscandar"" series as well. So far the Comet Empire series is lacking a bit in video and audio quality. The video is very grainy and the audio is mono and very drained. This may very well be due to poor masters. Either way I do highly recommend these to any anime fans. These are the original anime that started it all."
2,"Rather boring, rode here, saw this, slept here narative",For me this book did not capture the spirit or essence of a bike tour. Did not allow me to connect with the places or people along the way. I found Free-wheelin' by Richard Lovett to be a much richer reading experience.
2,Good construction but not for me,"Ordered and tried out. Very well made and like the quick disconnect. However, it is bulky on the neck area. The padded portion rode high on my neck and was uncomfortable. Returned item."
5,Awesome product to use.,I just brought the venus vibrance razor last month and love it. It leave your skin soft and smooth. It didn't nick or give you rash with bump. I love it. It is easy to use and it great for everyday use. I recommd this product to everyone to use this. It not sold in the store at all so I brought it on amazon.
5,Power Razor,I'm very happy with this razor. Cuts very close and is easy to use.I'm not as concerned about cutting myself with this razor as I have been with other ones...give this a try!
3,Vibrator with Blades,"Don't get me wrong, I like vibrators, and Venus razors are amazing. But deliberately putting blades on something which vibrates and is geared towards women is asking for a lawsuit. Trust me ladies, stick to schlick-schlicking the normal way if you know what I mean. This is dangerous. ITS A VIBRATOR WITH BLADES! COME ON!"
3,A nice razor,"It is a nice sharp razor that is easy to hold and has moisturizer on it, but the vibration doesn't seem to add to getting a closer shave. So I wouldn't pay any more for it than for a normal razor."
2,Where are all the drawings?,"I had this book as a little girl and it was lost just as long ago. So I was really happy to see it in print again - that is until I received the volume. Part of the charm of this story were the illustrations and, apart from the one right at the front, they are missing entirely. Where is Marmaduke Scarlet and his geraniums; Wiggins; the 'dog' Wrolf; Zachariah et al?I also preferred the original dust cover - it was more mysterious - but that is just a matter of taste I suppose.I shall now be looking for an old copy and keeping my fingers crossed!"
5,great fantasy- a must read,I bought this book many years ago when my family was going on vacation. I just loved it and have read it numerous times since then.....most recently to my daughter who also loved it. Feminists (which we are) should take some of the concepts with a grain of salt but the tale is beautifully crafted and satisfying.
4,Very enchanting...with one small flaw,"I absoultly adored this book. It is truely magical and would recomend it to anyone. However, you are probably wondering about this small flaw. That is, being an athiest, I was somewhat offened by some of the things said about athiests. One thing struck me in particular, when discribing a character, another character said, ""...but he was a terrible thing, an athiest..."" This is telling people, in my opinion, that while it isn't alright to make fun of people for their religion, it is alright to attack people that don't have a religion. Other then that, this book is a magical trip and a must read."
5,The Little White Horse,"The Kid in My ClosetWhen I was a child I had three favorite books: Black Beauty, which I read nine times, Misty of Chincoteague (I don't even know how many time I read that one) and The Little White Horse. Though I haven't read it in a long time I remember the magic that entwined me every time I did. I was riding right along in the carriage with Maria Merryweather as she arrived at Moonacre Manor. I adored the warm room with the blazing fire, the wonderful cat, the magic that enwrapped me and I even thought I smelled the geraniums. It is truly a book for the ages. I am now 60 and still remember this wonderful book which I will be giving soon to my oldest granddaughter so she too can be wrapped up in its magic. Highly recommended for any child who likes to be whisked off to and immersed in another world of delight and intrigue."
5,Wonderful book!,I Love this book! I'm so happy it is back in print because I believe it had been out of print for a while. I read a copy from an out of print book publishing company and I loved it! I love the way the plot all ties together at the end. It is an amazing book and you should read it!
4,"A Good ""Old-Fashioned Story""","After reading some negative reviews of this book, I needed to buy and read it myself. I couldn't believe that if the story was so bad, they would be making a movie of it.I believe that this is a charming ""old-fashioned fantasy"" ... nothing more, so why make it anything else? Let children read and enjoy the story. After all, it is not meant to entertain adults.Silver horses, magic, and peculiar circustances don't need to alarm the children who read the book or see the movie. I, for one, am anxious to see how this story is transformed for the screen. I will let my imagination run free with the little white horse, and simply enjoy the movie as pure and delightful amusement.I recommend this book for children to enjoy and anticipate the plot as the storyline develops. Their imagine will soar!"
5,One of the best books I've ever read!,"I think The Little White Horse is one of the best books I've ever read! The author is so detailed that her story literally jumps off the page at you! I could find myself reading this book for hours on end. I highly recommend this book to people of all ages and I mean ALL. I think that this book is wonderful. I think it's so good that I'd say that this book deserves more than five stars! In my opinion anyway. But if you are thinking about purchasing this book, you should! It'll be worth it completely! Be prepared to enter a world filled with magic and adventure!"
5,A 5th grade girl's favorite book!,This is one of the few books that really touches your heart. It makes you want to keep reading at every moment because it never loses your interest. I love Maria Merriweather's character and how you feel as if you are her friend discovering the mystery together with her. There is a deeper meaning and moral in the story as it unfolds and it has a very satisfying ending that stays with you. I would recommend this book for girls of all ages. I'll definitely be reading it again and again!
3,Quite charming,"The Little White Horse is a fun little fantasy, filled with a nice sense of atmosphere and a swiftly moving plot. While some events are a little too predictable and perfect to be believable, the delighted wonder they create surpasses these minor flaws.In fact, I only had two quibbles with the novel, though they considerably reduced my enjoyment of the story as a whole. To start off with, I wasn't really fond of the character of Maria, much preferring Mary from The Secret Garden, and secondly, there were several derogatory comments directed at atheists which I found quite offensive. The whole religious slant detracted from my reading pleasure and partially ruined for me what would have otherwise been a perfectly delightful book. Oh well. Other similar books include The 13 Clocks by James Thurber, Peppermints in the Parlor, The Ordinary Princess by M. M. Kaye, and The Search for Delicious by Natalie Babbitt."
1,Not Good,"I read this on J.K. Rowling's suggestion because I love her books and thought anything she liked, I would, too. I was wrong. It was only after I was reading the book that I read where J.K. said only girls should read it.Well, I don't recommend anyone read this book. Even girls. It's just too fake, too sacchrine, and too unbearable. I couldn't even finish it, and I generally can finish most books. No matter how bad."
2,Beware Of Cavities,"I read this book on the recommendation of J K Rowling who, according to the cover, ""absolutely adored"" it. I can only conclude that Ms Rowling has a sweet tooth for there is enough sugar in this book to sink a battleship.To summarise: Poor orphan comes to a magical manor house. Forms loving relationships with one and all - usually at first sight. Everything she touches turns to gold. And they all live happily ever after. (Oh, puh-leeze!)This book is not a patch on Rowling's own work. Don't make the mistake of thinking her recommendation suggests that it is. It is neither a mature work nor complex. After a strong opening it simply turns to mush and so many empty calories.And now I'm off to the dentist."
1,The little white horse,"Based on a storyline from the 1800's, this book, in this day and age, is verging on child pornography, child neglect and promiscuous language. I can see its value for literary purposes with much expressive language, however, the heroine of this book is 13yrs old at the beginning of the book, is treated as a child throughout, the story advances by just days at a time and yet in the end she marries in the next spring at the age of 13 or 14yrs. Some of the language used is so 1940's and has developed alternate meanings over the time frame of 60+ years. Some very good escapist scenes, however, it will be interesting to see what they do to this novel to clean it up for the 21st century movie that is planned. When there are so many other thousands of good storylines to choose from, why did movie makers choose this one?"
5,Don't miss this forgotten classic!,"Orphan Maria Merryweather leaves her home in London after her father's death. She, her governess, and her dog travel to live with Maria's uncle. As part of her new life she is introduced to her family crest, the lion and the unicorn. She soon discovers a family mystery. The more she learns about her family's past, the greater her desire becomes to right the wrongs her family committed. The answer to the family mystery lies in the family motto ""The brave soul and the pure spirit shall with a merry and loving heart inherit the kingdom together.""The Little White Horse is an amazing classic with lots of symbolism and deep themes including forgiveness, repentance, atonement, intergenerational relationships, heritage, identity, fear, courage, purity, love, vanity, pride, gratitude, and humility.You don't want to miss out on such a beautiful, meaningful book. It's one of those ""forgotten classics"" which need to be remembered."
3,A solid starting point,"While this book is in no way the definitive guide to using FrontPage '97, it is an informative and easy-to-understand review of the features available to first-time web authors and those new to Microsoft's powerful tool. The chapters flow in logical succession, but the reader can also easily jump around from one to another. As in other books in the ""dummies"" series, tip, warning and techical stuff icons provide greater understanding for the novice. The included CDROM has a few nice templates, but is not a major reason to buy this book. Once this book is read, the reader is ready to purchase Frontpage '97 Unleashed, a better book to keep beside your computer for continuous reference"
4,Batman At His Best!,"This is the first comic featuring Predator that I have read.It was a gripping tale.The most powerful people in Gotham being hunted and murdered.The artwork was excellent and the story was ace!The reason I only gave this book 4 stars because its all action and if you want a regular Batman book then I wouldn't buy this one.But it is still ace, best comic book I have read in a long time."
5,The ultimate test!,"The Batman takes on someone or something that may indeed be more than he can handle. A hunter is loose in Gotham City. After taking many lesser trophies he sets his sights on the Batman. By the end of the book, the Batman looks like more like Azrael. While I enjoyed seeing the Batman against the Predator, and it was very exciting (and bloody), I had a few problems with some of the Batman's and the Predator's actions. But the novelty and action overcome any real problems I have with the characters. Just look at the Batman movies, they have little relation to the true characters but they are exciting. To enjoy this book you must look at it in the same way.... I would recommend this to book to anyone who enjoys action"
1,Batman Couldn't beat a Predator EVER!,If i wrote this book Batman would be gone in an instantall it takes to describe this is one page Extreme Disappointment.
4,Important Slice of history,"This semi-autobiographical novel presents a clear picture of the Jewish poor in New York, their struggles to suceed and the success then achieeved. For anyone interested in this area, it is a must. As a pure novel, it is engaging, plausible, and moving."
4,Ferociously Good Sequel!,"Little wonder that Elmer Kelton has been voted the greatest western writer of all time by the Western Writers of America. His current novel, ""Badger Boy,"" extends Kelton's reputation of well-researched excellence. As entertaining as it's predecessor, ""The Buckskin Line,"" ""Badger Boy"" transports the reader to post-Civil War Texas with writing so vivid you can smell the earthiness of frontier cabin and taste the pungency of frontier justice. You find yourself caring about these characters and if you're like me, you'll be eagerly anticipating their further adventures. Sink your teeth into this one!"
1,Error 2,I must have misunderstood the description. This book style is not what I had anticipated or thought I was ordering.
5,A Fantastic Read,"This is a great, great book which portrays Bs As as it really is, flaws, particularities, & all thrown in the grab bag with the author's wry sense of humor. I think that one of the reasons that this book is so spectacular is that it mixes France's experience with historical and contemporary background on the country, which gives some insight into the why beyond many of the idiosyncracies of Bs As. I lived there for a year and have also lived in neighboring Santiago Chile and despite all of the hang-ups, bronca and general angst, especially now ( I returned in Dec 2001, when the country was on it's 3rd? president in as many weeks)-I would choose Buenos Aires and environs any day over anywhere else that I have visited or lived in Latin America-it is a beautiful city that grows on you which I think is accurately conveyed in France's book."
4,Well worth the read,"I found the book well written and enjoyed it very much. Never having been to Buenos Aires, I'll let the Argentines and the ex-pats living there hash out the amount of inaccuracies in the book. It's a place I've always wanted to visit and this book actually only increased my desire to go there. This book reminded me of the saying: ""You see the world not as it is, but as you are"". More accurately, one probably sees the world as a combination of the two. While I read the book I did have the impression that Ms. France was seeing her world around her with some pretty negative filters. None the less, it was well worth the read. I look forward to her next book."
3,Enjoyed it,"I imagine it is tough to write about about the culture of another country, as you most certainly set yourself up for criticism from all parties. I imagine there were some stereotypes in this book. Nevertheless I enjoyed reading it very much. Ms. France is a very good writer. She conveys a mixture of feelings and fact. I've spent some time in Buenos Aires, and I'm going to recommend that my Argentine friends read this book. I'd be very curious as to their comments."
2,Expectations Fulfilled? For Sure!,Buenos Aires is one of the best cities I ever lived in my life. Kind and hospitable people live there. Recommended. It is beautiful to read this kind of books where one can understand the frustrations and insecurities of a person by just reading it. She is undoubtly a professional writer. Ms France has a crystal clear writing. Way to go!
1,France's deplorable product,"I lived for 2 years in Buenos Aires (1997-1999), and I found the writer obtuse and opinionated. After reading the book, I thought it was not worth a dime, so I went straight to the book shop, returned it , got my money back, and bought a serious book about Buenos Aires instead."
3,"Funny, not so bad.","This book is not as bad as some reviews says. May be is not entirely accurate, but you should keep in mind the period in Argentina (1993-1994, the highest point of the Menem era) and the kind of people she had met (upper middle class). Many observations are really true (bank employees smoking on your face, lng queues for everything, the ""cafecito"" tradition, the ""desaparecidos"" stuff, etc.).Many argentine people could be upset by this book, but it had its moments. You can't take it as sacred word, but it's not ""only a bunch of lies"" as someone said.Read it, and read another books on Buenos Aires. And if you can, come to experiment by yourself!!!"
1,The writer sounds like unexperienced about cultural issues.,"For me the writer does consider the things in Latin America right or wrong or black or white but forgets to thing everything is just different from London.There are too much generalizations involved to her book that may not be agreed with most of the people who are living in Buenos Aires. Last, A classic British view to Buenos Aires. Do not loose your money."
1,Excuse me!,"Nobody can say this is a very good book. Nobody can say this is perfection. Nobody can say Buenos Aires is an ugly place. But first of all, nobody should spend time reading this really bad book!"
1,Shoddy Worksmanship?,"I got a these for my birthday (August) and now in November they are broken. The headset itself was fine, it fit comfortably on my head and didnt bother my ears at all.However, the wire has this big thing right in the middle for holding the batteries for sound cancellation, which puts an odd weight onto the left side of your head, as there isnt a wire running to the right headphone. Ontop of that the wire that connects the plug to the battery carrier somehow got twisted, and now has come entirely off, naturally making the headphones useless. At $50 you'd expect a product to last more than 3 months."
1,these are awful,"what you can't see from the images is that the battery pack to power the noise cancellation is in the middle of the cord, which is just plain stupid and annoying. you have to stuff the battery pack in your pocket, so if you're taller than 5'7"", then every time you reach in to your pocket to grab your ipod or whatever, you run the risk of pulling down the battery pack, which in turn jerks your head down and to the side. if you leave the battery pack out of your pocket, it's heavy enough that it swings around and hits stuff if you're walking around. i haven't even put batteries in the battery pack yet so i can't imagine how much heavier it will be with batteries in 'em. avoid these and look for noise cancellation headphones where the battery is on the actual headphone."
1,"OK, if you never move your head","These sound ok, but whenever I move my head they are super creaky and squeaky and noisy. This is loud enough to ruin listening to music and be distracting and super annoying. Unless I hold my head perfectly still it happens--even the tiniest motion produces this awful creaking noise from the headphones themselves. If I even yawn it makes this noise. Not very impressive in terms of construction if they are that scrapy and noisy."
1,Bought and returned immediately,"I'm with Maulleigh ""Maulleigh"" (New York, NY), these things don't fit (try bending your head down while wearing them and they slip off). Worthless."
5,Great Head set for the money,these head phones are superb and very comfortable to wear and for the price you can't beat it either.
2,Noise feature: nice. Sound quality: bad.,Remember when you were in high school and got your first car and it cost every cent you had and was really cool but it had the crappy original equipment stock car stereo so you saved up all your money from your part time after school job for the next month and went out and bought the most powerful car stereo you could afford and installed it and hooked it up to the crappy original equipment stock car speakers and cranked it up and blew out the speakers but you had no money left so you saved up all your money from your part time after school again for the next month to buy new speakers but for that whole month every time the sound got over a certain volume level it would get all distorted because the paper cones of the speakers were all ripped up?Remember that month?That's how these headphones sound out of the box.
3,"Work well, good value, mechanically weak","These are inexpensive and work well with airline audio systems, computers, walkmans. Battery life is excellent, at least 20 hours on a set of batteries. However, mechanically, these headphones are flimsy. The earcups twist for storage, but if stressed, they will break off. They can be repaired, if you don't mind using epoxy glue and wrapping up the break with wire, and not having the twist capability anymore."
1,WORTHLESS,"After only 3 uses, the earphone broke away from the headband while the set was in my airline carry-on, without any undue physical stress on the case. Since I owned these more than 90 days, Maxell so-called ""customer support"" told me they could do nothing about this and that the only thing I could do, short of getting this repaired locally, is to throw them away since the plastic connector was broken beyond repair. Never again!!!"
2,These don't work for me!,"Be careful with this product! The headphones are not bad quality, and though these headphones do provide some degree of noise reduction, there are some serious drawbacks -- at least for me. These include: (1) When you engage the noise reduction, noise is reduced, but so is the frequency range of your recording! (2) Either the headphones are relatively insensitive or there is an insertion loss even with noise reduction switched out. I assume the manufacturer assumes you'll be listening to heavy metal from a powerful amplifier. Well, I'm listening to classical through a flea-power anplifier. With ordinary headphones/earbuds, things are ""adequate"". With the Maxell, the volume is inadequate. And (3), with noise reduction switched in, the volume is even more inadequate. For my use, unusable. I wouldn't buy these again."
3,Great Sound - Suspect Wiring,"I LOVE the performance of these very comfortable headphones. They do an excellent job of eliminating aircraft noise while at the same time delivering excellent cd and dvd audio. Whether you buy these or not - it must be said that noise cancellation headphones are worthless unless they cover your entire ear and this model is perfect sized.The one drawback I have is that the first pair I owned only lasted about 6 months (of admittingly heavy travel use) because the cord broke at the point where it connects to the mid-cord battery pack. The connection integrity is pretty poor.I like these phones so much, and they deliver performance only slightly below my boss's BOSE phones that I have already bought a second pair and am hoping that being extra careful during use and when packing that I get much longer life out of them."
4,Excellent Noise Reduction,"Comfortable, excellent noise reduction, good sound. The noise reduction switch in the middle of a long cord can present a problem of where to put the cord when you are walking around doing things."
2,Not What I had hoped.,"The product is okay but the cups are a little small and are difficult to fit over my ear lobes; consequently, they can get uncomfortable after a short time. The On/Off switch is already failing after only a month. The static is being produced when turning it on or the right channel is cuts out when turning it on. I have to turn off and on several times for a clean signal or to get the right channel."
1,Awful headphones. Don't waste your time.,"I just got the NC-II headphones and they're awful. Not even worth the 1-star I had to give it. There's nothing redeeming about them. They say ""noise cancelling"" but it doesn't even quiet the noise from my computer's fan. There's no discernible difference between when the switch is on or off. In fact there's a scratchy noise when it's on. The plastic has a cheap feel to it and the packaging is that impossible to open unnecessarily plastic non-recyclable stuff. The 3.5mm plug doesn't even get past my iPhone's bumper. I had a nice pair of Panasonic headphones before they got left on a bus and I should have gone back to them. Buyer beware!"
1,Not worth the bucks,"After misplacing my old headphones, I purchased the Maxell Model HP/NC-111 because of the noise concelling feature. The noise cancellation does not work! My old headphones were better at reproducting music at half the price. What a rip-off!"
1,Does not cancel noise,"It does not cancel noise in any appreciable way (just a little bit, may be 10 - 20%)."
2,Maxell headphones,"These were great at first purchase, but they did not hold up very well. They were used only inside the home and handled carefully. One side speaker went and then a few months later, the other one stopped as well. They lasted less than one year. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.We opted INSTEAD for PHILLIPS O'NEILL SHO9561/28. These are extremely comfortable around your head, noise-reducing, fab sound."
2,Average,"Sound quality is good, but noise cancellation is weak. Effective as a pair of headphones, but not as noise-canceling headphones."
1,Look elsewhere,"I have had these headphones for more than six months, and I regret purchasing them. My principal complaint is the very awkward placement of the battery pack/sound canceling module, which is about halfway between the headphones and the jack, and which always seems to tangle the wires or otherwise get in the way. Also, there is some defect in the wiring which causes a sharp crackling noise when the headphone wires are moved and the noise canceling feature is ""on."""
1,"Consider them ""disposables""","I got these headphones in June. By August the sound in one ear was cutting out. I could move the wire and get it back temporarily. Fine, if you don't move your head. Now it's October and the sound in that ear is gone for good. That good price for noise cancelling headphones, isn't so great for only 5 months. Guess they are meant to be disposable.Don't waste your money!"
4,Great price to performance ratio,"As someone that has tried the more expensive Bose noise cancelling headphones, I can honestly say that the Maxell NC-II are well worth the money. I recently wore these headphones with relatively high expectations, and feel that they performed well for the money spent.You can tell that these headphones feel/appear made inexpensively - lots of plastic components. Take care of them, and they should last. Don't forget to grab a couple AAA batteries, as they are not included."
4,Good for the money,"I purchased these for medical transcription and they work great. My only complaint is the annoying on/off switch is right in the middle of the cord, which is obnoxious. But I would buy again for sure!"
3,So So,"I think the previous generation of the same headphones was better than these. They are comfortable though, and have great sound, so I guess if you looking more for cheap comfortable headphones these are for you, but don't count on the noise-canceling. I also found there is a odd L-R balance issue..."
4,"Good price, good quality","These headphones are worth the price. Although quality isn't up to bose standards, they still work and are noise-cancelling. I got them really cheap at a local Rite-Aid for only 30 bucks which is a great price. The only thing i find lacking is the volume of the headhpones. The volumes are very low and i have to turn up my volume almost two times as much as i normally do on any other headphone. As for the headphone breaking as people are saying, they arent that hard to break, just take care of them and your fine. I've had mine for 5 months and they are in perfect condition. I recommend these if you dont want to pay the $200 Bose headphones (although if u have the moolah get Bose) otherwise if your saving money these are a great alternative."
1,"Cheap, flimsy",I bought these and had to return them two times. They just stopped working each time. The wires seem cheap and faulty. One side always stops working and then the next side follows shortly after. I hope this 3rd set holds out.
2,Barely works,"There is a slight reduction in regular, low-frequency noise as in air travel, but these are not nearly as effective as Bose or Audio-Technica."
2,Depends on the type of noise,These headphones were disappointing. I bought them to use in a computer room that has a refrigerator size disk drive and an even bigger AC unit. These headphones do a good job of reducing the low-frequency noise but most of the high frequency stuff comes right through. As a result the noise reduction for me was about 20 - 30% of the total. I also tried them with a leaf blower and had the same results. They do seem to work well at taking out low rumbling humming noises like you would find in air travel but not for anything that has high pitched fan noise like AC units or vacuums.
3,Good value but you get what you pay for,"I have now used these headphones on a few flights and have found the following:1. They help versus not using them, i.e. they make a difference2. Battery life is very good3. Price is great!4. They are *not* very comfortable. My ears hurt after wearing them for the whole flight (longer than 5 hours)Overall, if you don't want to spend a lot of money on such gadgets, get this one. If you want the best, get the Bose one!"
4,"Surprisingly Effective NR; not bad headphones, either","The noise reduction works as advertized. Low frequency sounds are _greatly_ reduced. Higher frequencies -- human voices, in particular -- are less damped. But if you spend time around machines (airplanes, air conditioners, etc.) they make your life a lot more peaceful. As headphones (for example, for a stereo) they are OK but not great."
3,Works well until 1 earphone gives out,"I purchased these on a recommendation from a friend, who also had a pair. Plus, for the price, it seemed like a good deal.They sounded great and the noise cancellation really does work (especially the low groan of a plane engine).But...I've had these now for about 9 months and one of the earphones has already given out! Not sure why or what caused it, but I'm very disappointed with the quality.After talking with my friend, I have come to find out one of his earphones gave out as well.So, buyer beware, when they work, they work well, but as far as I'm concerned, they're now worthless after only 9 months."
2,Poor workmanship!,"Within a month of purchasing these headphones, I was hearing loud bursts of static, as if the wires were shorting out or something. And the cord was a major nuisance. Since the batteries are housed in a compartment on the cord, this made it weighty, causing it to swing around a lot, and not doubt stressing the wires inside. I use noise canceling headphones a lot, for TV, listening to music while I work, etc. Although the manufacturer honored the warranty and replaced the headphones, within a month and half, the same problems developed. Maybe these headphones are better for short term use, on a plane flight. They definitely don't stand up to everyday use."
2,ok for the money,"I purchased these as a cheap alternative to replace my Sennheiser noise cancelling headphones, which were fantastic, but which I managed to break. The positives of the Maxell HP/NC-II: 1) they're very comfortable 2) They're fairly inexpensive, 3) battery life. The negatives: 1) they really need a volume control on the headphones to boost output, 2) they don't seem to cancel anything- they just put out a ""white noise"" regardless of your environment.If you're uncertain about whether to buy noise cancelling headsets and don't want to spend a lot of money, these would be an ok investment, as they'll leave you aware of the possibilities, but leave you hungry for the real thing."
2,Good for a while...,"I actually like these headphones, when they're working. I believe someone else mentioned how folding can cause the wire to short, i've been through three pair of this particular headphone and each one has had that problem. All sound from the right cup dies out, and i'm very careful with use, they stay on my desk at all times, but do tend to fold them after each use. Anyway they're nice enough for me to try three times but i'm going to switch to a different brand that may last more than a few months."
4,Good Noise-Canceling Headphones!,"I have owned these for 1-1/2 years now and have used them mainly when flying on commercial jets. Their ability to cancel noise is better than the several other low-cost models I have tried, especially on jets. They are very comfortable. Their sound quality is good but I wouldn't say excellent. They appear to be more durably made than most other low-cost headphones. I have had no problems whatsoever, in spite of them getting squashed in my briefcase many times. They are relatively large, closed ear cup headphones, but fold up and store easily in a provided bag."
1,DO NOT BUY - LOUSY MAXELL CUSTOMER SERVICE,I bought these in September for use on long flights. One headphone has no sound. I consulted both the warranty information and their website and mailed the item in for repair/replacement.It was returned ten days later. Maxell moved in February 2010 but did NOT bother to update their website. I emailed Maxell and they promised a prepaid return label. The label took three weeks.I used their return label but heard NOTHING. I emailed again and was told it takes 4 to 6 weeks on returns.DO NOT BOTHER BUYING MAXELL.
3,No in-line volume control,"These headphones are ok, but I bought them based on the Amazon product review claiming that they have an inline volume control. The Amazon review is WRONG. There is NO in-line volume control on this product.Even if that hadn't been a sore point, these are still pretty mediocre headphones. They obviously haven't changed the design much since 1999, and it shows - they're heavy, cumbersome, and fairly uncomfortable. The sound quality isn't great - ok by 1999 standards, but definitely nothing special.Probably ok for a cheap noise canceling model, but if you just need a good pair of headphones and aren't going to use the noise canceling feature very often, you can do MUCH better than these.Personally, I much prefer my collection of Cyber Acoustics HE-200s, which are more affordable and come with an in-line volume control. They're not noise canceling, but I find them much more comfortable, easier to use, and delivering much better sound than this product for less money."
5,Excellent Home Audio Addition!,"Very nice. I used them as wireless headphones for quite some time before finding myself in a situation where I needed a headset and microphone combination. I remembered that these had that feature - it was not one I could figure out on my own though, I did need to reference the directions as to where to plug everything in at, but maybe that's just me. Anyway, once they were all set, they functioned wonderfully!"
4,Leg Cramps/Back Pain and Travel Improved,My Reflexologist/Massage Therapist got me on to this product.I was just going on a long road trip. I don't think I would have made it without the product. I have continued to use Hyland's whenever I feel that low back pain (3x back surgery patient) or leg cramping sensation.I recommend it to many people.
4,tonic is cheaper and works fine for me.,"A couple of gulps of tonic(has quinine)works just fine for me...no I don't mix it with anything and it is a lot cheaper than pills. I have these Hyland's Leg Cramp pills and they seem to work also. But you have to let them slowly dissolve under the tongue. I don't mind the bitter taste of the tonic water and it seems to work to alleviate the leg cramps, and other cramps, pretty quickly...nothing to dissolve. And there is nothing better than quick relief when you got a leg cramp. I have seen these Hyland's Leg Cramp pills (100 count) on sale for just under $5.00 so it pays to shop around."
3,my leg cramps,"I RATE IT FAIR,IT HARD FOR ME TO TELL AS I WAS TAKIN OTHER STUFF.LIKE VALERIN TOO. MY DOCTOR HAS GIVEN ME A QUININE SCRIP NOW WHICH HELPS WITH BAD LEG CRAMP'S. MAYBE IT ONLY ME BUT I FIND TAKEING VITAMIN C AND LEMON JUICE HELP'S. GOOD LUCK"
5,Evocative drawings...almost dreamlike,"While Piranesi is well known for his bizarre prison design sketches, his drawings of ancient Rome are even better I feel.This book includes a few dozen highly detailed sketches of ancient Rome as it looked when he visited in the 1700s. The area was filled with these fantastical buildings, almost 2000 years old, overgrown and desolate but amazingly intact. If you've ever wondered what the ancient world looked like before the industrial age when museums absorbed everything...this is the one to read."
5,Great sound quality -- well regarded by the Consumer Reports,I consulted the Consumer Reports before purchasing this phone because I have had wireless phones in the past that were just awful. This phone was reported to have great sound quality and was easy to use -- both things I have found to be true. Another reason I chose this phone was because the frequency did not interfere with my Apple Airport Expess wireless device.This phone does not have a speaker button on the handset so if this is important to you may have to look elsewhere.
1,Terrible!,"This phone has great features and great potential. But that's where it stops. It is extremely slow to respond when accessing different programs and freezes frequently. It also at least once a week it will answer in speaker phone mode and subsequently freeze up. The keypad is easily bumped when it's not locked, even with third part autolock software, it accidentally calls people quite often.So in summary, for free with new activation or less than $100 with Cingular rebates and a contract it looks promising, but you do get what you pay for.Don't buy this phone."
4,LOVE IT!!!,"I switched from a cingular 8125 to this phone and couldn't be happier. The cingular phone required two hands to operate (because of the touch screen) unless you are clever enough to figure out how to use voice activate. The cingular phone was very user-UNfriendly. With the E62 I can use one hand and the joy stick works like a champ - don't know why they can't put that on lap tops instead of the ""mouse button"". Getting around the programs is easy. Without the camera it is much lighter. It is easier to read the font and the ring tones are also louder than the Cingular phone so I can hear it in my purse. Wonderful! If you hate using the touch screens, get this phone!"
1,Avoid this phone!,"This phone has known battery life issues. After 6 months my battery doesnt last longer than one day. Software is excruciatingly slow moving from menue to menue. During one billing period the phone connected to the internet by itselft over 1,500 times. AT&T's solution: disable all data access. Mercifully, the E-62 has been discontinued, but be advised to steer clear."
2,intentionally crippled device,"I got this phone as a replacement after I dropped my treo 650 in the toilet.I have to say, it's a really awesome design. Very comfortable and the sound quality is way better than the treo, which was one of my biggest gripes.There is one major problem though that I feel is my duty to make known. The java support on this phone has been crippled by cingular so that developers have to pay to have their applications work without an annoying pop up message every couple of clicks. Had I known this before i would have bought something elseRecently google has released 2 breakthrough mobile applications, google maps and gmail mobile, both of which are virtually unusable because of this preconceived handicap.If cingular (who has an exclusive US contract on this device)removes this limitation, it would be the best phone I've ever used. As of now, it just makes me feel ripped off. Search the net, see for yourself."
2,Buggy Exchange Connection,"Beautiful phone that plays wonderful video, easy to read e-mail IF & WHEN it works. We bought 2 units and spent a significant amount of time trying to make it work with Outlook in the office only to give up. Both on its way back to Cingular.The Outlook client was easy to install and the sync happens almost instantly. Calendar items, e-mail, contacts all went in elegantly. Then it stops working. The client freezes when trying to sync. Uninstall, and reinstall... no luck.Video also stopped working. Cingular said it only guarantees 3G phone to work and this is not 3G. I told the technician that it worked beautifully for 2 hours last night. Cingular's official line is that it does NOT GUARNTEE that it works. Too bad. So much for iTV.Joseph Ng"
3,"Phone Yes, Data NO!","The E62 is a great phone with many good features such as MP3 ring tones, very detailed phone book...Cingular edge data is terrible, very slow and problems connecting to the server, even with full single. $39.00 a month for data is excessive. If it were an additional $10-$15 one could live with the problems.I returned my phone to Cingular within the trial period and will purchase a 3G / WiFi E61 unlocked. Lots of good things in the near future with 3G/Wi-Fi and the ability for VOIP."
4,Cool Toy,"I gave this toy a four star because....I bought this slinky for my two 1/2 year old daughter. She likes it, however I think she might be too young for it. I was having more fun showing her what it can do. It brought me back some memories. I think it is still a cool toy. I would just store it till she is a little bit older. I think every kid should have a slinky sometime in their life. The toy is just like I remebered it...it is durable & slinky."
1,Rip Off,"Who didn't like there Slinky?I bought an ""original"" one for my kids, but it was too short to go down the stairs. So then I bought this super retro original. Same deal, older box.I found out that Slinky was sold to Proof, they shortened it by about 20% to save cash, but it doesn't work anymore. Why not just raise the price 20% and sell ones that work?"
2,Leaves residue - Use for display only,"I loved Slinky as a child, gave one to each of my kids, and keep one on my desk at work to use when I need to think thru a problem. This particular slinky leaves a black residue on your hands that requires soap and water to wash off. It comes off so easy that I assume it would dirty your clothes too. I do not recomend this 1945 Collector's Edition for children or for anything more than a visual display. Buy the silver one if you want to handle it."
1,Something wrong.,"This item is black. I do not ever recall seeing a black slinky, they were all silver like uncoated metal. And yes, I was there in the 40's and played with a lot of them. Also it fails to do it's thing if your steps are 11"" deep and covered with carpet. Back in the 40's the steps were less deep, at least in a row house in Philadelphia and they worked like a charm."
2,A step down from the first CD,"The first CD by Meade Skelton was solid, considering that he was so young at the time. Some people complain about the production of this album, but I think it's the rawness of the first album that helps pushed that particular recording into excellence. This time around, with more keyboards and a glossier sound, it seems more pedestrian and stale than its predecessor. It sounds more like a colllection of songs, rather than an album; it lacks a certain consistent intent, and as a result, the final payoff is anti-climatic.Nevertheless, his vocal abilities still have much to admire, and I still think he has potential. Nevertheless, Buyer beware!"
1,Another failure,"This Meade Skelton character produced another sup-par album. It wasn't technically as bad as his first, these songs aren't the classics that he butchered on his first album, but still musical atrocities.Believe it or not, there is a ray of hope for this ""singer"", as bad as this album was, and it was very bad, on the title track, 'They Can't Keep Me Down', I detected a glimmer of talent. If he gets a voice coach, and works really hard, he might not be that bad, but he's pretty far away from being 'not bad' right now.I am glad there weren't any stalker songs on this one, like that Nicole Kidman song on the last one."
1,If you like white trash country this cd is for you!,"This Cd was like his last one. One song has the lyrics 'I don't want to be with you anymore, but we can still be cousins.' This made me regret my purchase."
3,Not nearly as funny as Redneck Night Before Christmas,"Not nearly as funny or innovative as Redneck Night Before Christmas. It is a fun series, but if you are only getting one, get Redneck Night Before Christmas."
2,"Hilarious, but terrible audio","Ray is great, hilarious as usual. But I dare you to find a volume setting you can live with on this disc. His voice is too low, and the audiences' volume is ridiculously loud. I almost can't listen to it. D- to the mixing team."
3,Worst sound mix ever,"I'll let the others praise the funny Ray. In a nutshell, if you like his TV show, you will very much like his standup.My huge complaint is the awful sound mix. I don't which is worse, the capturing of the ultra-high sound of the audience or the up and down volume of Ray talking into the microphone. At times he barely audiable, other times he is yelling, but most of the time the levels are OK. I either had to gringe through the very loud clapping and laughing or turn it down where I missed some of the presentation."
5,Much Deserved Grammy,"Ray Romano has a gem with this cd! While playing in front of a live audience at New York's Carnegie Hall, Mr. Romano gives the dirt his life has to offer. It's funny--some of the jokes he tells have also been jokes on his show, ""Everybody Loves Raymond."" One thing for sure--this cd will keep you entertained the entire time. Highly recommended!"
5,hilarious,"My wife loves Ray Romano's comedy, so I bought this for her. But I would say I enjoy it just as much as she does. There are a few segments that are kind of ""eh"", but in general, it is very funny, and a few in particular are outright hilarious. Some great bits on married life."
2,Sound check ... one ... two ... testing ...,"My wife has me addicted to his television program Everybody Loves Raymond, so when it was approached to listen to his stand up on a very long car ride, I thought it would be of some humor. Boy, was I wrong and the car ride suffered for it. It isn't that Romano isn't funny, it is the sub-par quality of the CD. Listening to it for about twenty minutes I could only hear about three of his jokes. Either he wasn't standing close enough to the microphone, or the company that published this release didn't spend the time to correct the sound. I didn't get past the twenty minute mark as nothing was making me laugh and the jokes that I did hear were average. Nothing much to write home about, but I would borrow a friends before buying this one just to check the quality of the sound.Grade: ** out of *****"
3,Romano scores when you hear him,"Everyone Loves Raymond Ray Romano bring his stand up act to Carnegie Hall. It is a great CD, when you can hear his act. I dont know if it was the hall or the mike system. Romano fails on and offSo it is funny, when you can hear him...YES. However it is hit or miss on the sound.Note this is a CLEAN adult album like how Bill Cosby use to do. It is intelligent comedy about real life. I love what he talks about when he chats with the audience about his twin two year oldsIt gets 3 stars because of the sound quality of the recording.This CD was done in 2001 and it sound like it could have been done yesterdayBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
1,still love Ray but not worthy buying this CD,"as other viewers commented, the sound quality is extremely bad in the way that you have to turn the sound volumn very very loud in order to hear Ray but in the mean time, your ears could be hurt by the crowd's clabbing. Bad recording unfortunately, but no discout on Ray's sense of humour."
4,basil oil,I bought this planning to preserve some of my summer basil for the winter. Sorry to say he says repeatedly that the oil will be good about a week. Rats.
1,Awful,"Worn two days, lost all of it's stones. Worst thing I ever bought. Don't buy one ever! Was not good!"
3,ring,I bought this ring as a promise ring for mii girlfriend. When I showed it to her online she went crazy for it and really really wanted it. When i presented it to her she blew her mind. This is a very pretty ring but the cut of the diamonds are scratchy and hard. For example if she was wearing the ring and rubbed on my arm it would feel like a claw running down my arm. Its still a very nice and beautiful ring but its a little too rough. I would still redommend it just wear it on a necklace or something jus dont hit or rub people with it on.
5,Truly useful knowledge,"If you're interested in how people gain expertise, and how they can communicate it to others, read ""Deep Smarts.""Dorothy Leonard and Walter Swap provide much insight into the value of ""deep smarts,"" -- ""a special form of experience-based expertise ... critical for managers to understand and appreciate.""Leonard and Swap describe methods companies and individuals can use to cultivate and share the most useful kind of expertise. They understand the complexities of sharing knowledge that's based on experience -- you can't really know some things until you do them. But you can get better faster at doing those things if (as Leonard and Swap show) you have experienced mentors who provide guidance and share expertise."
5,I love this cookbook!,"I don't know if there is a better way to attest to how good the book is than to say: I have made things in this book for special occasions without testing it first. I know her recipes are that good! I don't make any desserts that the recipe didn't come out of this or the cookie book. I just wish she'd write a third! Everyone loves my baking, and I owe it to Rosie."
5,The only baking book you will ever need to buy,"I bought this book in a used bookstore - hard to imagine! I love baking but have been let down by one to many recipes in my time. This booked looked different though - the title itself goes along with my thinking of baking. When I bake I am not into the diet - fatfree form. I intend to indulge in all the delicious flavors that only come from ""real"" ingredients. I tried several things and they all turned out perfectly. Then I baked the pinapple upside down cake and my father-in-law who isn't the biggest talker - couldn't stop talking about the ""best cake he had ever tasted"". Try the brownies, the carrot-pinapple cake and the chocolate chip cookies too, oh and the pie crust recipe - simple and perfect every time. You will never find my copy of this book in a used bookstore. This is just simply the best ever baking book I have ever owned."
5,My favorite baking book!,"Every recipe is a winner -- personal favorites are Noah Bedoahs and Brownie Shortbread. All are simple to prepare with step by step, detailed instructions so that the end results are exactly the same, each and every time a recipe is made. My first copy of this book was the paperback version ... used it so often it fell apart; I replaced it a couple of years ago with a hard cover copy. Judy's second book, all Cookie recipes, is also a worthwhile investment!"
2,If you are a better than average baker....,"I own many baking books... and I really wish I had NOT paid for this one. Every cake I tried came out like a dense biscuit with a heavy baking soda taste. Cakes are hard to make from scratch, but there are better books out there. It's a bland book."
2,I hate the organization of this cookbook!,"I love to bake, but this book is not baker friendly. Most of the recipes roll over to the next page and the small type is not easy to quickly glance at while preparing. I'm sure there are great recipes in there, but I prefer a cookbook with quality and easier to use."
3,Put some effort into the visual...,"The book has good material. Great stuff for really experienced scratch builders.. ok.. good... but how about those who aren't experienced in all things boat building??? Many more photos that go along with the old style text would be a real service. I've let a friend who is a great ship-scratch-builder look this book over... he agrees fully! So, come on..if you are going to do something like an instructional book... make it so it easily educates. Take this from a retired teacher. It will truly make a difference."
4,This one cracked us up,"My 4-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son thought this book was hilarious, especially the line about the paprika. They kept wanting to check it out again from the library so I finally bought it."
2,Very poor audio quality,"A while ago I bought this DVD. Although I wasn't even expecting great audio, the sound on this DVD is killing the joy of this small club concert. I love Max's playing and skills but I wouldn't recommend this DVD to anyone but die-hard collectors.Patrick Peeters"
4,Awesome Case for the price,"This case is small, snug, secure and comfortable. I've had 3 diifferent cases for my Axim since I bought it 2 years ago and this is by far the best. The only thing negative that I can say about it is that some sites state that you can actually dock the unit to the cradle with the case on. That is not the case, and I would not try forcing it either. Other than that, I think it's great!"
4,Fine cover,Definitely was worth it. It outlasted my axom (won't protect against water). The workmanship was great. My only complaint is that the snap stunk. I eventually cut it off and put some magnets inside the case to replace it. Worked just as well and gave the case a much smoother look. I'll definitely use RhinoSkin again.
3,School Requirement,No news is good news. Required for my daughter 6th grade english class. So far so good. Not my first choice though.
5,MAXELL 8-HOUR TAES,"I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY, EXCEPT THAT THEY GIVE YOU YOUR MONEY'S WORTH. IT'S GETTING HARDER TO FIND THESE, THOUGH. WHEN AMAZON RUNS OUT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'LL DO."
4,Amazon Purchased,Good product for using to record surveillance around the house. 8 hours better than 6 hours. Saves time and money.
5,as advertised,"still love my VHS player & need these. Since most stores no longer carry these, Amazon is the perfect source"
3,VHS,I gave these tapes an OK rating because they were OK for recording only one time on them but if you had to re-record on them they were no good and unfortunately I found this out the hard way. I would only recommend these tapes to someone who is only going to use them one time.
5,Great,Only place I can still get VHS tapes so i can tape my favorite programs and then watch when convenient
4,A new approach to saving the environment,"This book is a real eye-opener. It shows how sometimes the private sector is much better at protecting the environment than the government is. It builds from early examples in the 19th century up through effective private-sector efforts today. At the same time, it points out how government programs sometimes worsen the very problem they seek to correct.Some people might not believe its notion that the private sector will always do the right thing. And, of course, it won't. However, this book is a good guide to the growing movement to find a better way to protect the environment."
1,Why would anyone want to read this book!,"It is interesting that you posted only one comment, and of course it is a ""raving"" one. This book has no merit and doesn't warrent the time it takes to read it."
5,"Simply, the best gardening writer ever....","I had spent many years reading Henry Mitchell's gardening columns in ""The Washington Post,"" one of the greatest joys of that particular paper, and I was crushed by his death. How exciting to find anthologies of his columns! I've tossed the old, yellowing clippings of several columns that I had kept over the years. A wonderful reading experience, and wonderful stories (i.e. the hound and the clematis).Pity the folks who offered poor reviews and hope that their eyes will be opened."
4,"Beautiful, wry writing about the pleasures of the garden.","Henry Mitchell is to garden writing what Roger Angell is to baseball writing, which is to say, the best. These short essays are as much a philosophy of life as a detailed look at the trials and tribulations of a passionate gardener. Thoroughly enjoyable."
4,"A delight for the gardener and non-gardener, alike","This book is such fun for anyone interested in life that begins in the soil. Mitchell's dry humor and pithy observations about the joy and frustrations of growing things are delightful. I loaned this book to a ""budding"" armchair gardener (who doesn't even have window-box to plant) and she loved it. She ran out to give several gopies to every gardener she knows. THe short essays are the perfect length to read before falling asleep at night."
5,Perfect Choice for the Active Metal Musician,"I was just reading the reviews of the product because I want to get another one for a friend, and there was a bad review from the kid's mother, that kid was learning to play violin. I guess I didn't work for them because he's just a kid and not a musician, (probably he didn't know how to use it and he broke it) I'm a music student and I use it EVERY DAY over and over, and nothing had happened to it for the 8 months that I've been using it. I tried other known brands as korg, boose a I couldn't find the options that this little device can offer. this thing was made for combat."
2,Not very durable,"We purchased this item when our children began to study violin. It seemed convenient to have a device that combined the tuner function and the metronome function. Initially, the tuner and metronome functions performed as described; however, very shortly after we started using the device, it began to exhibit a variety of problems. In particular, it would refuse to go on, or when turned on, its display was populated with nonsense (basically, all of the LCD elements were on at once), and you could not put it into either tuner or metronome mode. Inserting fresh batteries might revive it for a few days, but then it would start to fail again. It has only been perhaps six months, and the device now fails to work entirely. Would recommend trying a different brand."
2,Was fantastic until it BROKE the second time!!!,"I'd love this if it hadn't broke after my second time using it. I replaced it with a ""Tune Tech"" TT-500 and love that one."
4,Don't go to Nightown without it.,"After several fail attempts to derive a decent amount of meaning from the Circe chapter, this book made it not only clear but fun. Other chapters, which I thought I had a good grasp of, such as the Penelope chapter, became even more lucid. Blamires provides a road map to get through the Ulysses labyrinth without allowing himself to get bogged down with every detail, leaving the reader the delight of discovering the treasures of allusion him or herself."
1,"Very, VERY Badly Formatted Digital Edition!!","This pains me to do this because I generally abhor one-star reviews in Amazon, because they're usually from clueless people or people with an axe to grind.However, I want to call attention to a problem with the Kindle edition of this book.Put very simply: the text of the digital edition I downloaded is littered with numbers - unlinked and extraneous - throughout the text of the first 20-30 pages, which is as far as I bothered to check.Proofreading prior to release would have been a very good idea."
4,I Needed Help And I Got It,"I too, like countless others, could not get passed Proteus, chapter 3, line 1: ""Ineluctable modality of the visible..."". Complete frustration set in and I felt I had no choice but to set aside Joyce's masterpiece - that is until amazon.com sent me my copy of The New Bloomsday Book - A Guide Through Ulysses. With Harry Blamires' help I was able to make substantial progress in a very difficult but rewarding book. Blamires helped me overcome my initial frustration and understand the masterpiece that Ulysses is. By no means am I now an expert on Ulysses; however, I was able to enjoy Dublin through the eyes of Joyces's famous characters. Oh, how I am looking forward to visiting Dublin again, but on some future June 16th. Take the leap - join those of us who are already fans of Ulysses but let this book be your guide. You will not regret it. By the way - there is a $25 paperback version."
1,Don't Bother with Blamires Bloomsday Book,"Blamires Bloomsday Book is a huge disappointment. It provides an overview or summary - when what you really need is a guide to help understand the language, the syntax, images and allusions. If you really want to learn Joyce and appreciate Ulysses, you have to get inside the language. I agree 100% with the reviewer who said go with Sparknotes if you're looking for a summary - it costs far less than Blamires, and is more helpful."
3,A Great Guide,"I like the Bloomsday guide because it helps the reader understand Ulysses. It is good to see crossreferences and interpretations. He is very strong on religious symbolism, but Blamires helps get through the book Ulysses."
4,Safe,"Did not contract AIDS from coming into contact with this product, but I would advise using protection just to be safe."
4,Death Row doin it's thang,"I wasn't that much of a Death Row fan until I heard this album. When I first put it in, Made Niggaz was the first song I heard. That's perhaps the hottest joint down by Tupac. That's the song that got me hooked into listenin to Tupac. The song after that with Kurupt was a tight track as well. Skip a lil to 6 Feet wit Storm, well done. Blazin~!! Then Tupac and the Outlaws at the end, another tight one.Then I put in the first CD. It wasn't as good as the Second one, but it still had some good songs on it. ""Questions"" and ""Free em All"" were the best on that CD. Tray Dee had a solid performance on it. ""Staring At the World through my Rearview"" I l kinda liked that one. On ""Free Em All"" there's a guy tryna sound like Tupac, but that track is still hott. Hollywood Bank Roberry when i first heard it, I didn't like it. that was when I first got it. Now, I heard it yesterday and it was pretty good.Overall: This is tight. A ""MUST GET"" mos def."
5,"Gang Related Movie Soundtrack. Good soundtrack to a Good Movie, Plenty of Great songs.","Favorite songs are Made N**ggaz By 2pac Feat. Outlawz(all of them), Lifes so Hard by pac/snoop, Lost Souls-Outlaws/Pac, These Days-Nate Dogg/Daz, Ice Cube ""Greedy"", Whats Your Fantasy?-Outlawz/Young Noble/Storm/Napoleon,plenty of others, A Complete great soundtrack to a Great Movie! 2pac's Last movie. The best hands down song:""Staring thru My Rear View-2pac Featuring Outlaw Immortals: Yaki Kadafi and EDI Amin."
1,horrible,i tried to watch this movie a couple times but i couldnt. its horrible. the first time i watched it i feel asleep and the 2nd time i just turned it off cause i couldnt stand it. not one of eddie murphys better movies. this is probably his worst.
2,Give your money to Charity,"I sat through this from end to end. Murphy's portrayal is nebulous, and the best parts from the preview do not carry the whole film. If you go in looking for a wild comedy (as the previews hyped it) you will be dissappointed to find a rather thinly written love story. It has its moments, exactly five of them...I have an archive of some three thousand motion pictures on tape, and this one will not be joining it. It's time to continue your journey."
1,OK NOT TO GOOD,IN EVERY FILM THERE SHOULD BE A BEGINNIG MIDDLE MIDDLE MIDDLE AND A END BUT THIS HAS ONLY GOT A BEGINNING AND A END
2,Disaster,"This film was a disaster. It was too corny, the plot was too weak and the funny parts weren't at all funny enough. Towards the end it really started to seem as if it was a Truman Show ripoff. The only redeeming feature of this film was Eddie Murphy himself. He could make any film - no matter how bad - watchable. His talents, however, went to complete waste on such a poorly thought out script."
1,YOU ARE ALWAYS WAITING FOR THE BIG BANG,YOU THINK THAT THERE WILL BE MORE EXCITEMENT BUT IT IS JUST THE SAME PACE FROM BEGINNING TO END POOR PERFORMANCE BY BOTHE MURPHY AND GOLDBLUM I HOPED FOR MORE AS A MOVIE STAR MYSELF WASTE OF TIME ESPECIALLY AS EDDIE WEARS THE SAME CLOTHES THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE
1,terrible,"this movie was so boring. It was just horrible, I was thinking this was going to funny but no this is eddie murphy's worst movie ever. Just simply terrible if i could give it 0 stars i would"
1,Two hours of my life ... lost forever,"I saw this movie at a free advance screening. Not walking out was one of the biggest regrets of my life. I look back on the two hours I spent in the theater that night as some kind of delirious and miserable fever dream. Anyone who likes this movie is either brain damaged, Ned Flanders, or a little bit of both."
1,I don't get it,"This was the dumbest movie I have seen in a very long time. It's advertised as a comedy, and we are supposed to accept Eddie Murphy as a serious character after being told otherwise? Watching paint dry was more entertaining than watching this. Oh yeah, one more hot top- if the focus of the film is really on Jeff Goldblum's character development, you don't cast a major star in a supporting role because it takes the spotlight off the main character. If you want comedy, grab ""Beverly Hills Cop"" or ""48 Hours"". This is a bomb."
4,"why do do charge so much, I got mine for 18.95.",why do you charge so much when you can buy it cheeper at local department stores
1,Another Truman Show.,"I'm puzzled, Was this supposed to be a comedy? This is not classic Eddie Murphy material. Very litle is funny in this movie. Put this one on the shelf next to The Truman Show."
3,OK NOT TO GOOD,OK GOOD AT TIMES AND BORING AT TIMES BUT I RECKON YOU SHOULD RENT IT AND DECIDE UPON YOURSELF
1,Pure Garbage,"This movie is just terrible. Holy Man tries to juggle all aspects of emotions but drops the ball. It's not funny, it's not romantic, it's not warm, and it's especially not worth your time."
4,Eddie's turned into a religious man!,"Hollywood favorite Eddie Murphy will make religious people laugh with this awesome flick. Great support from Jeff Goldblum,Kelly Preston and Robert Loggia. If you saw this film and loved it,I'm sure you'll love 48 HOURS,ANOTHER 48 HOURS,THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN,BEVERLY HILLS COP 1,2 and 3,COMING TO AMERICA,THE GOLDEN CHILD,TRADING PLACES,BOOMERANG,HARLEM NIGHTS,the DOCTOR DOLITTLE films(remakes) and THE NUTTY PROFESSOR films(remakes)."
2,Not My Favorite,"I liked other lego houses much better than this one. You can build the model and it looks just like the picture. What I did not like is that I felt limited in making up my own designs with this set. The 2 doors are differnt colors and I would have liked to have more windows (none in the back of the house). I'd even be willing to give up the car for more windows. Also, in doing my own design, I don't have beige bricks, so I had to use what they had and could not add any from my collection. So, that is why I gave this a lower than usual rating for a lego set. It is OK, but I like other sets a lot more because I think one can be more creative with them and get better ""special"" parts."
4,Feeling the Fear,Half way throught the book there are a lot of exercise and personal work for the individual reader. Trying to read through one time and then read again and do the accompany work. Insight thoughtful. Personal crises and stories and the author personal battle with cancer and overcoming. Up lifiting make you feel better about yourself and makes you ralize that we all have fears and we need to over come them to be able to move on with out lifes. Enjoyed the book so far.
4,Feel the ear and Beyond,"Many people can benefit from this simple ""Feel the Fear and do it Any way."" There are many different kinds of fear. At this time in America post 9/11, oil spills and the violence and crime have produced more fear than any time in our history."
4,"This a workbook companion to ""feel the fear and do it anyway""","This a workbook companion to ""feel the fear and do it anyway"". I havent read it yet but I can imagine, if its like the book it will be awesome. ."
5,Lion of Scythia,Yet another great start to a trilogy! If you are looking for a great read with adventure and a new world dusted with a history you won't want to miss..this is it!
2,eh,"I got this phone for Christmas and was really excited because all my friends had one. Then i discovered how easily this phone freezes. It dropped off my couch on a carpeted floor and froze. When I got text messages it would say the text is from another person in my phone book, not the person who actually sent the text, It also sent random picture messages to people. Then it would turn off randomly, and one day I couldn't get it to turn back on and had to reset my phone!It was really a pain, cool graphics though, I guess."
1,Not a good buy,"I bought this version of the Razr and my family all bought the normal version. My phone did not work by the end of the first year, and all their's are still plugging along fine. First the earpiece stopped working so I had to talk on speakerphone if I wanted to talk at all (very embarrassing), then the screen started going black. This is by far the worst phone I've owned (every previous phone has lasted me 2 years without problems, all the way back to the bulky Nokia). There are much better investments than this phone - phones that do just as much, or more, and have a better track record. Don't waste your money!"
3,The product was good but small,It was a lot smaller then I had thought it was going to be even after I looked at the big bag that I had already....I thought it was they were the same sizes
3,It's a bit too dusty for my rats.,"I have three rat babies. One neutered buck and two little girls and When I got them I was originally using Carefresh, which I used for years on My chinchillas, but for the Ratties I found it to be just too dusty. They sneezed and sneezed and sneezed. I took them to the vets who suggested we change the bedding first (because there was no porphyrin discharge and everyone was still happy and healthy with nice clear sounding lungs) I switched to sifted dust free aspen shavings and everyone stopped. So apparently everyone was sensitive to the bedding, which is a pity, because Carefresh is top notch with odor control and it's nice and soft. The aspen is okay, but I liked the Carefresh for that much better, but their health comes first."
1,Volume Misleading,"States a 30 liters bag, packaged as a 12.5 liter bag that expands to 30 liters. Should include all information, not just partial. And you should put the volume in the title, not make customers search for it. Bedding is decent, but be wary of volume, as this was a lot less than I was expecting for the price."
5,The best,"This bedding is great. It lasts for at least a couple of weeks depending on size of cage and how much you use initially. It cut down on changing the bedding significantly and it controls odor very, very well. 2 thumbs up!"
5,great bang for buck,"best price for quality small animal bedding, not a pretty color, but i doubt my hamster cares all to much about the brown cardboard color. but if you want your cage to look all pretty then this isnt the bedding for you, howeve if you just care about function, then this is the stuff to buy"
3,"Okay, but not amazing.","Carefresh Natural Pet Bedding didn't live up to it's claims, but came close. It has a odd, strong smell to it that may have something to do with the way it's made. I use it for hedgehogs and rats- it holds up well for absorption, but not so well with odor control. On another note, none of my pets have experienced any allergies or health concerns since using it."
1,Missleading.,"The picture made me think this was purple Carefresh colors. It isn't. It's basic beige colored bedding and not nearly as soft as the one I thought this would be. I was highly disappointed and have two of these to show use for my precious little dwarf hamster.I've had this about a month but just put it in today so cannot tell you how well it absorbs smell, but if you're looking for purple, soft bedding, this isn't it."
5,R. deVoll Fisher - A Brilliant Author,"Caleb's Branch is a story of a young man being brought up by a father figure who adores the child as his very own. This book is written with such love and sensitivity on a males view of raising a young child with ADHD, where his sister had her own serious issues to deal with in life. We learn of the government welfare issues and how people are treated within the system. There are no safety nets for children with sick parents. Though deVoll tells this warm story of how a man dedicated himself to help a child whose mother was emotionally unavailable to cope with life or raising a young son.This story tore at my own heart knowing the difficulties of being a single parent and raising an ADHD child.deVoll is a brilliant Author. He reaches into a soul and embraces ones deepest feelings.I look forward to all of his work."
3,It's OK,"I was hoping this CD would be as incredible as their first album, ""Music for pleasure"". Unfortunately, they apparently completely changed their style. It's an ok CD, but their first is so much more impressive."
5,More Pleasure,"I've heard this album twice from a friend, and I think it's great. If you liked the first Monaco album (or either of the Revenge albums, which despite what you might hear, are great) you will love this one. It has the classic Peter Hook bass guitar, along with many other classic New Order elements, but with a more modern sound. And although I like Pottsy's voice a lot (and it really does sound like Bernard's) Peter Hook's vocals are way better - it would be great of he sang more on New Order albums..."
4,"Good, but in typical monaco fashion","For those of you looking for the 'next' New Order album, you may be expecting too much from this album. Die Hard fans of New Order may find the lyrics and tunes a bit simplistic and similar to the previous Monaco album. If you enjoyed Monaco's previous works, you'll love this one. Hooky's bass is as lively as ever and Pottsy's voice sounds better than his last effort. Overall, I'd recommend this album to all fans of New Order."
5,Get your feet soaking wet,"I've just finished getting through a book on Lingo, and decided to pick this book up in the hopes of becoming an Actionscripter. The writing style of this book is excellent-- it wastes NO time with senseless conceptual jargony and gets straight to the point. You'll find yourself actually learning at a quick pace through a series of short examples of Actionscript that become more advanced and build on previous examples in the book. Better yet, the CD is packed full of open source examples for every short tutorial in the book.This book is the definitive actionscript reference. Though, beginners be forewarned-- this is not a book for those who are not familiar with the fundamentals of programming and those who are not fully acquainted with Flash's interface and a conceptual understanding of animation."
1,"Good for armchair reader, useless for actual visit","I wonder if Lynne has ever actually been there. The author spends half a paragraph asking numerous questions you'd like to ask, give you a short answer you can find with park brochure, then refer you to the visitor center to get more information and get map (apparently the author has been to and is familiar with the visitor center). No detail info on any of the trails and tours. I've been to the desert once or twice and I know more about the subject than the author describes in the book.I am also extremely disappointed with Sierra Club Travel Guide. Next time I won't buy their books blindly."
4,desert california in one volume,"Updated since I bought my 1987 edition this book is a wonderful one-volume introduction to California's desert regions. My battered, coffee-stained, spine-broken copy is the best testimony to its usefulness I can give. The overlong introductory section cuts down on space for regional descriptions but the advice is worth reading, especially the section on safety. Very strong on regions ouside the well-known parks the author encourages visitors to explore and hike on their own. The book is a well-rounded blend of information on flora, fauna, geology, history, hiking and 4WD touring. If you are new to desert exploration this book will break you in easily and safely."
5,THE book on work!,"This is THE book on viewing your work from a Biblical perspective. Ch 4 is worth the price of admission: Our God loves to work and work is a holy, everlasting calling! I have read a large number of books about work but this is the best I have found for dealing with the ROOT issues. Be prepared to be challenged, encouraged and equipped to go to work!"
1,Wolf in sheeps clothing,"Simplified from my old review:Dennis Peacocke preaches and inserts notions in this book that are:1) Dominionist (believes Man-kind can control and effect the redemption of creation)2) Partial Preterist (discounts most future prophecy in Revelation, Daniel,Zechariah, etc. and believes God suceded the covenants He made with Israel)3) Quotes and references Karl Marx (histories foremost communist and atheist- the irony is simply fantastic)If you do not subscribe to these ideas and theologies; do not buy this book. If you practice historical-grammatical hermeneutics; do not buy this book. If you have been untainted by this extra-biblical and potentially dangerous teaching; do not buy this book."
5,Great New Year Motivator,"This book is an excellent study on understanding how every person can ""do business God's way."" Don't feel that you have to be a business person to enjoy this book. It contains 12 life principles that if followed will empower you to discover and fulfill your destiny. I have used this book in small group studies for our Marketplace Ministries class and it is enjoyed by all and said to be very practical while theologically sound. It provokes questions and answers questions that you've always wondered about. A must read for every person that is unsure of God's business in their life."
1,useless,another useless karaoke cd from disney. do they not get without graphics makes it just an instrumental track & not karaoke.
1,Terrible Product,"I ordered this because all I wear is Chloe Narcisse and I always get compliments, but this was not up to standards at all, It doesn't even smell like Chloe. I am very unhappy with the product!!"
5,Amazing novel... great cultural insight...,A very moving novel about an unusual Chinese tradition. Gives new understanding to the ritual of footbinding so the reader (esp Westerners) can have a new appreciation for why women bound their feet.
5,The Three Inch Golden Lotus,I have yet to review the books as my sister is bringing them back fro the states - delivery of one could not be made to Australia so I had both delivered to my nephew. I am happy to respond with a comment when I get the books.Thank youSusan GaalNote I have given 5 stars - though I am still to read the Book.
1,Don't waste your time.,"In my opinion, this book was horrible. Everyone else has written about how great it was, so I must have missed something.I suppose that on a broader scale, the book may have exposed some universal truths about culture, but my goodness the author could have done so in a more succinct fashion. I mean maybe 100 pages as opposed to the 220 of countless irrelevant details.I wouldn't recommend this one."
4,"Finding this CD isn't as easy as spilling the ""salt"".","Ever buy a compilation CD just for one song?Here you get at least three!!!There is a little bit here for everybody,including the extremely rare ""Salt in my Tears"".Killer early eighties angst rock well before Alannis was even conceived.Well,almost. If you can find this one available get it because it won't stay in stock anywhere very long."
5,An Incredibly Emotional Journey!!!,"At the strong suggestion of a friend, I picked up this book...and never put it down! At first, the author poured the foundation with some very real and honorable characters. As the story progressed, to my own surprise, my tears of laughter were replaced with tears of compassion. Throughout this heart-wrenching (and heart-warming) tale, the author painted some very descriptive settings in which the Gulf War was fought. And it seemed that just as I finished the book and wiped my eyes, reality struck: This author didn't just escort me on an exciting adventure that he took ten years ago- he actually taught me to FEEL what he and his comrades endured...and continue to endure. He taught me why it's so important to remember! I think it's time to offer the same support we gave our Gulf War Veterans ten years ago. After reading this book- it is clear that they need it even more now!"
2,"Good player, bad lifetime","As everone else said, it's good while it lasts. I bought mine a year ago and it worked fine until recently. Now it squeeks loudly when playing DVDs and skips a lot. For the price, I think it was worth it - it lasted a good year for 70 bucks. Don't buy this if you want something that will last a while! It seems to have about a 1 year lifetime."
1,Remotes go dead in a short time,"I have now purchased 4, yes FOUR Sungales hoping to enjoy their advertised features. The special features work fine! However, the machines are deadly. Within a short period, less than a year, the remotes on all 4 machines have gone dead. I have found no way to revive them, and without the remotes the ""special features"" can't be accessed."
5,The Life of Reilly (Two-Disc Special Edition),"Excellent in every way thinkable, thank you. I had viewed this years ago and found Charles Nelson Reilly's tale of his life to so honest with so much pain, from which came so much humor...his ability to take one on the adventure of an amazing life of an amazing human being....and of an amazing actor that is no longer here, but he will never be forgotten by me....along with family and friends that will view this movie, along with my own recounts of his story."
5,What a joyful man,"I first discovered Charles Nelson Reilly when I was a child watching the ""Ghost and Mrs Muir"".He was so funny in that show, and it wasn't until I watched ""The Life of Reilly"" that I found out he was supposeto be in only one episode. But thanks to Hope Lange knowing what a talent they had in him, she told them to make Charles a regular.He had a hard life as a child, but he seemed to find ajoy and faith in himself that kept him going. I wish I would have had the chance to see him perform in the many stageproductions he appeared in/or directed."
5,"'Life of Reilly""--Movie Rental","A Fun Film, Fun approach of Charles Nelson Reilly telling his story.The Struggles of growing up in New York, and people's attitudesTowards somone who was ""Gay""--comment made to Charles by anExc--saying something along the lines of ""No one would watch someonethat looks like you or we don't put Gays on Tv. Well Thank God TimesChange etc. Plus When Charles--Goes down the list of Students that where inhis acting close--it's amazing. That all of these people--at the time--Young andUnknown--wanted to do--whatever it took--for them to do it. Because theyLoved it. Kept their Dream alive--just like Charles. Along--with at the end aTouching Story of his friend Burt Reynolds. --and what Burt had done for him."
1,Not correct regional format.... So sad.....,"I wasn't aware of the fact this DVD is in a different regional format, I was so sad to find this out once delivered."
4,Apparently a good movie (if old),"Arrived on time, decent recording. Ordered as a gift for my dad and I honestly haven't watched it, but I haven't heard him complain about it so it must be alright."
5,funniest movie ever made!,"Sure, it's hyperbole. But I love this movie. It cheers me up when I am depressed. I think it's funny even though I have watched it so many times I know the jokes by heart.The acting is great, the plotting excellent, the pacing unbeatable, and the jokes are very funny. What more can you want? I hope DVDs don't wear out!"
4,"""What is this, the bargain basement?!""","Why is it that when I try and talk to my peers about it, nobody has heard of this film? This is a real comedic gem, from start to finish, unlike most of the [garbage] that's being made now. Bette Midler and the whole cast are fabulous. If you like comedy, this film is one of the best!"
5,CLASSIC COMEDY WITH A GREAT CAST,"Hilariously over the top comedy, made instantly memroable by the ever fabulous Bette Middler who easily steals the film along with Danny Devito.The general plot of this raucous comedy is that following Middler being kidnapped and held to ransom, the comic kidnappers don't realise that Middlers husband (Devito) wants her dead anyway.Crazy but very funny with a great cast that also includes Judge Reinhold, Helen Slater, Anita Morris and Bill Pulmon.Classic comedy that is highly recommended!"
5,It's no doubt one of the best.,"Being world-level stars, Danny Devito and Bette Midler successfully proved their professional skills again. The performances of Judge Reinhold, Helen Slater and Anita Morris are remarkable too. I was especially surprised by Bette's amazing achievement in bodyshape training - she did make it! That's real! - not only in the movie. Although this film is perfectly funny in my opinion, what a pity that I cannot recommand it to friends' kids, because of some sexual scenes which are really really hot - they do know human nature well."
4,The era of Bette,"1986 to 1989 were big years for Bette Davis on the movie scene. In 1986 she filmed Ruthless People with Danny DeVito and the lesser known Helen Slater (Supergirl fame). Ruthless People, while a bit dated, has some hilarious moments and needs inclusion in any Midler collection.Who could forget the kidnapped Midler lifting paint cans to keep fit and lose weight. Well, it's one way to keep yourself busy while being kidnapped.Bette went on to star in the funny, but not as good as, ""Outrageous Fortune"" with Shelly Long.DVD SUMMARY: Ruthless People is a bare-bones DVD. However, worth owning for the Bette factor alone!"
4,Liked the movie,Brought back memories from seeing it a long time ago. Quite a bit more vulgar than I remember. Still get a chuckle.
4,Funny stuff,"A modern, adult version of THE RANSOM OF RED CHIEF. Sam Stone (played by Danny DeVito), a big-shot clothing designer, wants to kill his wife (Bette Midler), but she's kidnapped instead. His problems are over, right? Wrong. Stone's girl friend has a blackmail scheme of her own going, which mistakenly involves the chief of police. Things snowball and of course Midler gets her revenge (along with the kidnappers - who are really the good guys just trying to get even with DeVito who stole their clothing idea). It's pretty fast and furious, with some very funny (and some mindless) scenes. Worth a watch."
5,"Hysterical, and satisfying","For my money, this is one of the funniest movies Hollywood ever made. It starts out funny, and continues funny, right up to the end, when you realize that the good guys have won.The entire cast: magnificent.If you want to sit around feeling glum tonight, DON'T WATCH ""RUTHLESS PEOPLE!!!"" :-) :-)"
1,Garbage,"No flavor, thick powder, doesn't mix well with the popcorn. Would not recommend any of the flavors to any buyer"
1,Waste of money,"I had wanted the Kraft Mac 'n Cheese Topper but my local grocery store did not have it. So I decided to try this one, and was sorely disappointed. My 4 and 6 year old girls also did not like the Kernel Season's seasoning and prefer the other one. My 4 year old actually said ""Can I have the cheese in the blue thing?"" The Kraft cheese topping tastes more like real cheese, and whereas the KS seasoning is a much finer powder that has an odd taste to it -- we use the topping mostly for popcorn, but since the KS tastes odd, my girls will take plain popcorn over popcorn flavored with this. However, I lucked out and found that Amazon carries the Kraft cheese toppingg and got it on sale. Cannot beat the deal. Amazon is awesome!"
1,don't inhale,"I bought this hoping to add flavor to other things as it said on the container, but none the less i couldn't even eat anything i put it on. The flavor was of overly salty salt, and the dust in the air will choke you to death."
3,Great flavor BUT doesn't stay on popcorn at all,"None of the Kernel Season' s Popcorn seasonings stick to popcorn. ALL the flavors taste great, I think we have tried all of them. BUT you end up using tooooooooo much and it stays at the bottom of the popcorn bowl. For some reason even trying various brands of popcorn these seasonings do NOT stay on the actual popcorn. The selection of flavors are great, and I haven't found another popcorn seasoning brand with as many flavors, yet. ANYONE out there no of something better? I would try it."
2,Should be called cheese salt,"This is not cheese to sprinkle on popcorn. This is cheese salt. If you are looking for that cheese popcorn that turns your fingers orange, this isn't it. Add that much of this product and you'll end up with very salty popcorn you can't eat.Retail stores offer very few popcorn topping products, but you can find this Nacho Cheddar flavor and many other flavors locally. Try dog/bullseye and rollback where it's only $1.99. The internet has a ton of products, but you are either going to pay dearly for one bottle of something, pay outrageous shipping, or have to buy in bulk and possibly be stuck with 6 bottles of something you don't like.So know what you are buying if you order this product. Check your local bullseye or rollback first. You can try many different flavors without buying in bulk, yet pay roughly the same price as if you did."
3,Doesn't taste right on popcorn.,"It doesn't really taste ""good"" on popcorn but it's not bad.One of their flavors that would be better on something else . . . vegetables? I dunno. Maybe broccoli I guess, if you wanted something more healthy than a mountain of cheese."
3,Tastes Good on Popcorn.,"Kernel Season's are a good choice for sprinkling over hot air popcorn. The Nacho cheese is one of the better flavors. If you really want a tastely cheese topping for hot air popcorn try the Cheesy Popcorn Seasoning by Reese. Also, the Kernel Seasons are cheaper at Marc's."
2,Thats not what cheese tastes like,"Its ground too fine.. I inhale it when chewing and it burns my airway. Also the flavor is very artificial, salty, and strong. Tried on veggies too. It just tastes so much more like fake flavoring than anything else. If I closed my eyes, I would never guess this was supposed to be a cheese flavor.I like Molly McButter brand better. Its more flaky than dusty, the flavor more closely resembles cheese (or ranch or whatever). I pop the corn, spritz with a bit of aerosol oil, and sprinkle. Helps it stick. I probably wont buy this one again. I had that same overly salty, too finely ground dusty problem with Reese's brand too."
5,Satisfying Mysteries,Any book of Carla Neggers is so enjoyable and keeps you on the edge of your seat trying to figure out who done it. These are great readings.
3,Okay but lacks intensity.,"I really didn't get to feel much danger in the story bec. that's the way Cozie and Daniel seemed to view the threat. I also disliked the way Daniel interacted with his best friend, J.D. I suppose that some of Daniel's dialogue with J.D. and Cozie was meant to be witty. But they came out rather accusatory instead. Also some of the characters sound like real hypocrites. Cozie and Daniel are also totally blind and stubborn regarding some clues."
4,Good for the money,"I originally bought this ring about 13years ago. It sentimentally signifies my family. When one of the bands broke I needed to replace it. I love that the sizes are variant and I could wear it on a bigger finger than I had previously, but the bands are a bit thinner than I had thought. Ultimately ~ worth the money."
2,Misleading Description,Unfortunately when this item arrived it turned out to be only 3mm gauge bands as opposed to the description which has the bands at 5mm each. I contacted the seller suggesting that they had dispatched the wrong item as they also have listed a 3mm version but they assured me that I had received the correct item and suggested that if I was not happy with it to return it for a refund - which I have done. I find it odd that the seller is unaware of the anomaly in the description and then to assure me the item is correct when it is clearly not as described - go look for yourself!Sterling Silver Russian Wedding 3 Band Ring
5,Great value,"After reading countless reviews, I settled on this unit. I'm not disappointed. Great specs, great looks, quality build and materials, great price."
3,Poor Quality,"I ordered this 'used' from one of Amazon's dealers. It arrived okay, etc. but the VHS picture is very old/grainy looking. I was a Hart to Hart fan when they were first on television. I think I could tape a better picture right off of my television programming."
5,Exciting and Entertaining!,"These two episodes with Freeway, the dog, are alot of fun to watch because he is so cute. The Hart to Hart episodes are always very entertaining!"
5,I highly recommend this book.,"My sister gave this book to my daughter as a birthday present last week and my daughter can't seem to put it down. It has beautiful illustrations and a storyline that warms parents' hearts. I especially recommend it if you have ever heard your child say ""I want to join the circus"". I highly recommend this book."
3,"Good Info, but most is for stocks","The information presented here is decent, but if your a futures trader as I am, the indicators time frame doesn't fit trading futures. Look elsewhere if you need a book on T.A. for futures trading."
3,good benchmark,This is very good book if you would like to understand systems and compare them however it uses only monthly data and it doesn't give you any suggestion if you should apply any system or not as an investor.
2,Formulas are in Metastock,"Add 2 stars if you don't care that the formulas are in Metastock shorthand, NOT in straightforward mathematical terms. I'm a programmer, looking for a book with the straight formulas for technical indicators. Here's what it says on the book, as quoted by amazon: ""Simple, intuitive, easy-to-understand, and precisely defined formulas"". Sounds great, so I buy it. NOWHERE does it mention that these formulas are in Metastock shorthand, which is NOT decipherable without Metastock, so I returned it. The book is very good at explaining the use of these indicators, but I'm very disappointed in the misleading marketing of the publishers and amazon."
3,Focuses too much on indicator performance,"This is a big fat book that devotes most of its pages to an analysis of how each indicator performs when used as a sole trading strategy. Less emphasis is given to the detailed, objective, comprehensive and comparative explanation of each indicator along with its intended usage, pitfalls etc. The book does contain some of this latter information here and there --- but not in a comparative and structured way. You'll only find a page or two devoted to the fundamental explanation of the indicator, in contrast to many more pages devoted to how it performs relative to buy-and-hold and other strategies."
3,Disappointing,This book is a repeat of what is in the diet books with a little more information on specific nutritional information.However I found it confusing to find specific items such as an avacodo (I dare you to find it - I couldn't). Really it is just another verison of the GI index. There are better indexes out there.I was sent the book when I joined the on-line support group. I am beginning to regret that decision. I will probably be donating the book and finding a good GI index.
2,"In it's day (2004) a great resource, cover states ""completely revised and updated""","Misleading, this book has been in pubication 8 yeears, what's new and updated about that?.............needs more listings to meet with the changes in not only choices at the grocery story but at the various markets, etc."
3,South Beach Supplement,"Not exactly what I expected. Pretty small book, but good reference charts in there for lots of kinds of foods. A good guide for those committed to the diet for the long run."
5,Take a long,"This book is the perfect size for your purse or bag. I carry with me to verify my food selections. It includes sections for Phase 1,2 and 3. Very easy to understand."
2,South Beach DietGood Fats/ Good Carbs Guide,"I ordered this book to provide me with answers to questions that weren't answered in the basic diet book. I found it wasn't any more helpful than the original book. The format doesn't explain what to look for in a food and it spells out that nothing is acceptable to eat. Basically if I had bought it at a store, I would have returned it."
3,"good ""cheat sheet"" on carbs","This info can be found in the South Beach book and cookbooks but it is a quick and fairly complete guide of what carbs are best to eat with an easy to read guide of total carbs, sugar, fat, fiber and which phase certain foods can/should be eaten in. Also, it's smaller so fits in the car or purse to carry with you when out or grocery shopping so you can quickly check a certain food or catagory. Not necessary but a good resource if you don't have the cookbooks."
3,Not as Useful as I thought,"I have the original South Beach Diet Book and thought this would be a more comprehensive list of what I could eat. There are 1200 foods listed in this book but close to half of them say to avoid them on all phases. I found a few foods to eat that I would not have known before buying the book but was disappointed that items such as pie, ice cream, french fries and other obviously off-limits foods were listed and like I said before, they took up a lot of the book."
4,Better than the last edition,"I own both the older edition and the new edition and I find that the new edition is much easier to use. Not only is there an index for most items, but there is a breakdown of the foods by phase, which was lacking in the previous version. It is very helpful, however, I still feel that it is lacking in some food choices. I hope that the next edition has more foods listed."
3,Burnout revenge,"this game is a good arcade racer, and it has a good soundtrack. but i liked burnout takedown better"
4,"Yikes, now that's fast.","So I'm a huge fan of Burnout: Takedown, and I'm initially eyeing this release as suspect - it's either going to be the same game, or they're going to add some new element that's going to suck.But no, basically they've made the best arcade racer, ever.While Takedown gave you a sense of speed, this game makes you feel like wetting your pants. It feels so fast, it's crazy.The additions to the race modes (traffic attack and racing with the detonation feature active during aftertouch) work well. Being able to slam into traffic from the rear was a bit hokey to me for about 11 seconds, then it was just that much more coolness thrown on top of everything.I'm giving this game 4 stars ont he PS2 platform, as the music just outright blah blah blah - it's largely unimportant, at least takedown had a track or two that stood out. Unlike the XBox version, you can't have your own tracks, so you either turn it off or you're stuck listening to it."
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring!","A little truth in rating. I gave it one star because zero wasn't an option.This game has its moments... ... and then there's the waiting.Those moments of real excitement sprinkled in between endless, agonizing periods of waiting for the next scene to load. It's really slow!I would never have purchased this game if I had known about this."
4,A worthy follow up to Burnout 3,"Burnout 3 was undoubtadly a crowning achievement in the racing genre, and Burnout Revenge proudly carries the torch. Boasting another glossy, bug budget package; Burnout Revenge features pretty much everything veterans of the series would come to expect. There's some improvements to the gameplay here and there (Eliminator is much better here), but for the most part Burnout Revenge plays identical to it's predecessor. Oh yeah, the game looks great too. The cars look great and the various modes of play are still oh so much fun, but for the most part there isn't anything here that we haven't seen before. Burnout 3 was ahead of it's time, and while Burnout Revenge doesn't really do much to improve on a formula that didn't need many improvements to begin with, it's still one of the best racers and driving games you'll find on the PS2 today. Whether you're a longtime fan or newcomer to the series, Burnout Revenge is a treat, and it's worth picking up."
4,"I like, ownze this game","Wow. An awsome sequal to Burnout 3. This is one of my all time favorite raceing games.Pros:Blowing up your rivals when they take you out.Plowing threw trafic and nailing your rivals from behind with a taxi.Beautifull tracksAwsome graphics.Cons:The music 5uck5, turn it off.Camera gets shakey when boosting.The new launch bar in crash mode is stupid, getting a fast launch is next to impossible.The cheering in crash mode can get on your nerves.All and all an awsome game for anyone into raceing. get this game now."
2,Description given not accurate,"I purchased this book under the assumption it was in great shape and no markings or highlighting throughout. In fact, the book had numerous highlights and pen markings throughout. This book could not have been sold anywhere but over the internet because of the condition it was in. If I did not need it when I recieved it, I would have returned it and bought elsewhere!"
2,Liberal Bias,"My colleagues and I were extemely upset at the fact that Ms. O'Connor blamed the Challenger Shuttle disaster on the administration of Ronald Reagan. College textbooks should be unbiased as to give students a clear picture of the American political system, the author should not force her own views on her students. Where is the world is Professor O'Connor?"
3,"It's Multi-Channel, that's about it.","The musical content is five star material. But the audio quality is not what I expect from the SACD format. Multi-channel sounds nice but it doesn't blow me away. If you're looking for a great SACD along the same venue, try Earth Wind and Fire's SACD ""Gratitude""."
5,Simply Spring - Simply Perfect,"I have always wanted a set of Corelle dishes and now that I am a senior and live alone I can. The ""Simply Spring"" set is lite in weight and beautiful to look at. Best part for me was that this set came with 4 matching glasses instead of cups - which I don't use. But you can get it either way. Microwave and dishwasher safe too. I even use it in my pressure cooker.I wanted a larger bowl than the cereal bowls in the set and so went to the local Outlet Factory store and bought a plain white Corelle one. Fits into the set nicely I am very pleased. And I bought the matching burner covers as well. Now I leave the dishes in the drainer and the covers on the stove and the kitchen looks great."
3,"Doesn't Measure Up to ""Dwarf""","After the release of ""Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me The Pliers!"", there had to be a letdown with ""Bozos"". It's just not possible to improve on perfection, and ""Dwarf"" was flawless. With that caveat, this album is still worth a listen and has several good sections, but don't expect another ""Dwarf""."
5,Fudd's Laws,"The Firesign Theatre released their fourth album on Columbia Records in August 1971. This is usually the most remembered album by non fans with the conversation going something like: I like the Firesign Theatre other person: Oh yeah, what was that one about Bozos? For those of us who also dig Wavy Gravy and love the Dead like I do, this album has added significance. A few months after this album's release, the Dead did a major tour of Europe in two buses with one being reserved for Bozos. The album mixes a surreal twist of humor and science fiction into an entertaining 40 minute experience. I even love the nod to then state of the art computers."
3,Tamagotchi V1s are better than V2,We all no that tmagotchis are fun and the best toy ever but we don't know that V1's are better than V2! Why are they you ask well I'll tell you.......First thing V1's are funner and more enjoable than V2 and they are really less complicated. You have a better chance of getting good charicters! V2's get boring and they have the dumbest new Charecters They stink. V1's are funner and better.I also contacted [...] to tell them This story and to sell V1's in the stores again. Please remeber V1's are a classic and are more enjoyable than V2 please remember what I said in this review and If you have a V1 you don't take care of take care of it! THANK YOU for reading!
1,Help me out,My name is Amelia Amadon @aol.com under Hyperchick1192. Over the past 4 weeks I have visited in hopes of a tomogatchi connection and each time have left emptyhanded. Also I looked for VideoNow PDV's. At that also I have been unsucsesful. Please respond.Thank you very much.
4,A quick reference guide,"A paraphrase from the opening lines of Joanna Simon's book on the same topic summarises the situation well: ""The complete guide to matching food and wine does not exist....yet"". However, Mary Dowey's book does an admirable job for the foodie wanting a logical wine recommendation, with a clear explanation of why the match should work. The book is easy to read, and is organised by dinner party courses, so the host should design the menu, and can then match wines accordingly. The images used in this book do an excellent job of making the mouth water, but I would have preferred them to be more prescriptive (ie. present comparative examples of colours and wine styles with the same food, or the same wines with a range of different dishes to help foodies who are planning a theme to their dinner parties). Otherwise, I found this book very useful, and still refer to it occasionally, when stuck for a wine and food match."
1,This is the Battlefield Earth of music.,"I try to see the value in every song. I am a songwriter who has had his work both praised and slammed by critics. Therefore, I don't make blanket statements about someone's art unless I strongly feel they apply. I try to see the value in every song. I see absolutely no value in this song.It may be too soon to say this, but this might be the worst song of the millenium. This is the Battlefield Earth of music.Good Intentions do not equal Good Music. In fact, they often equal the polar opposite... case in point ""We are the World."""
4,Missing the point,"I believe most of the other reviewers are totally missing the point of this song. Sure, it's not one of Paul's best but I have news for you folks, you can't write a ""Let It Be"" everytime. Take the song in the spirit in which it was intended, to show Paul's support of the American people. He didn't want to get bogged down in sentimentality and he didn't have months to write one, he was hosting a benefit concert and needed a catchy tune. In that, I think he succeeded."
2,You wanna like this....but....,"In the spirit of patriotism and heroism, it almost seems wrong to not support this record, but reality is reality and this is a poor song. Poor by Paul's standards, lyrically poor by any educated 5th grader's. The spirit of the song and the event was, and still is, touching. But it would have been nice if the first sounds of ""Freedom"" weren't stolen off ""Give Peace a Chance"". And in light of the historical context of the event, you'd expect Paul to come up with something a little less Sesame Street-ish. But alas, this was Paul ""I can write a song in 10 minutes"" McCartney, and odds are he was just looking to have something, anything to play that could relate to 9/11. Given his talent and previous credits, something more emotional or powerful was expected. Instead we're stuck with ""Anyone who tries to take it away, will have to answer, because this is my right."" It's not a Civil Rights case Paul! Neil Young's ""Let's Roll"" stands up much better as a tribute song."
4,"""Freedom"" the one bright spot...","Let me get this right, Ole Oleson. You hated ""Freedom,"" but considered ""From a Lover to a Friend"" a good song? While ""Freedom"" isn't the greatest thing he's ever done, it's head and shoulders above the entire ""Driving Rain"" album, which makes this long-time Macca fan shudder when any bit of it is played. ""Freedom"" is the one bright spot in an otherwise much-anticipated, but sadly disappointing, album."
1,self-serving political propaganda,"Guess what? An attack on the Pentagon, the World Trade Center, or Wall Street, though certainly criminal, is not an attack on ""freedom"". I am not, of course, in a position to divine the intentions of the perpetrators of the attacks that precipitated Mr. McCartney's song, but it is reasonable to suppose they had something to do with resentment of the United States's military aggression and economic imperialism. It is not reasonable to assume they had anything to do with opposition to democracy, freedom of speech, and freedom of religion. Mr. McCartney and Mr. Bush would have you believe someone exploded airplanes through the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, and the Magna Carta. No.In any case, this is an awful song. Its lyrics are nonsensical (considering the circumstances of the events to which they allude) and insipid, and its music is pretty much non-existent."
3,Contradictory McCartney,"Freedom is a simple song about the feelings of a musician with deep relationships in America, particularly in New York. Musically is a catchy and simple song easy to singalong, but the problem in this song is the lyrics: ""I will fight for the right to living in freedom"" is not what you expect for ex-Beatle and pacifist musician (Pipes of peace, tug of war). The cuestion is: the war is valid when I'm the offended?"
3,LEAVE PAUL ALONE,"The criticisms you read here are mostly by people who don't really know Paul, and over-intellectualize about one simple song. ""Freedom"" doesn't do anything to change what happened on 9/11, with ONE EXCEPTION: I sounds heartfelt, it felt good for this saddened soul to hear, and I don't need to analyze it or Paul beyond that. It wasn't meant to replace the Star Spangled Banner that you patriot-types hold it up against. It wasn't a snipe at Lennon's songs or legacy, it was a song written by a man who was moved by this tragic happening. He's not American, but he tears down borders by saying simply that God gave us our freedom (he did NOT specify, because God indeed gave it to us ALL-even those who can't fathom the possibility of God or spirituality). It's a song. If you don't like it, why go into a tirade against Paul?"
3,A very unsatisfactory case,"Much as I love Georgette Heyer--truly the queen of mystery and suspense as the publisher says--I can't say I loved this book. It's more character study than murder mystery and a great deal of the book is spent establishing those characters. In fact, the only mystery in the first half of the book is why anyone would put up with Penhallow and the dysfunctional relationships at Trevellin. I kept wishing the family members would get up enough gumption to leave, get jobs, and support themselves so they didn't have to put up with the tyrannical Penhallow. But even odder for a murder mystery, is that we're in on the crime. It's never a mystery to the reader who committed the crime or why--the only suspense is whether the murderer will get away with it or whether someone else will take the blame. Overall, a strange book--but Georgette Heyer can make anything interesting."
4,A Fantastic light hearted dark comedy drama-tragedy by Georgette Heyer,I consider this is one of Georgette Heyer's best but it's not her usual regency romance. It's more of a dark comedy drama -tragedy than mystery. You know who committed the murder however it was not solved by the police and the killer's identity was mistaken by the family(except the killer.) The killer got her punishment everyday for the remaining of her life after the murder so the justice was done in a sense.As usual it's all light hearted wickedly funny with fantastic characters full of irony and witty sparkling dialogs too. Every character are flawed but never dull. It really makes you think. So this is a true serious literature in a sense. I consider this is classic.
2,Penhallow,"I was disappointed in this book. I didn't like any of the characters, and it was incredibly predictable. Sorry about this since I really liked her other novels."
2,The Worst Well-Written Book Ever,"I was very excited to find this book, having loved all Heyer's historicals, but now am afraid to try any more of her mysteries. Her writing is excellent: fully formed characters, great descriptions, spot-on depiction of the surroundings and times. Very atmospheric, so why did I hate this so much? The family tyrant , Penhallow, has absolutely no redeeming features. I could hardly wait for him to be killed off so I wouldn't have to read any more of his rants. None of the other characters, although beautifully depicted and described, are at all likeable either. Well, maybe one, a minor chacter named Clifford, but even he has a hateful wife. I definitely did not expect the humor and style of Heyer's Regencies. In fact , I was very impressed by her skill with a modern-day story, but what a slog this was !"
2,A Hateful Heyer,"'A very unsatisfactory case,' the Inspector said.That's the last line of this book and I couldn't agree more. There is not a single likeable character in this story--each and every one has been twisted and blighted by the patriarch of the Penhallow family. When he is finally killed more than 2/3 of the way through, it is a relief, and since we know exactly who did it, there is no suspense except whether or not the murderer will be exposed.But that's not the worst of it--the worst is the endless descriptions of every single piece of furniture in each room of Trevellin, the home and prison of the Penhallows. Several times she describes the position of each member of the family in a room--both relative and absolute--in a way one might expect to be relevant. But no, she's just spinning out a tedious yarn, banal in its sadness. Even the witty character is never more than mean.I think this one is enough to break my Heyer habit for a bit. Time to catch up on other reading."
4,"It's not likeable, but its good","I have to totally agree with the above review. This book is excellently written! It is similar to Agatha Christie's 'Hercule Poirot's Christmas' - only Heyer wrote her version about 5 years earlier. An old man is the tyrant of his household. When he is murdered, everything comes apart. Georgette Heyer conveys the emotions of dispair and hopelessness and regret much better than Christie does in her version. The murderer thought things would be better, they're not, but the old man can't be brought back to life again. I didn't like it because I like more light hearted books - and this is not Heyer's normal light-heartedness, admittedly, but it is very well written."
3,The psychological Heyer,"Those who expect Heyer's usual romance, or even her usual mystery will be disappointed. ""Penhallow"" tells the story of an elderly tyrant, who keeps a tight reign over his numerous family. Depending on their respective personality, most of them are either nervous wrecks or are holding in deeply repressed anger. With such an atmosphere, it is no wonder that Penhallow gets murdered; but the reader knows who the murderer is. There is no mystery, in other words, though there is a plot twist which allows the murderer to get away. Instead, the focus is on the intense atmosphere of bitter rivalries and anger between the members of the family. It is fascinating, in a warped sort of way, and therefore a good read; but some may find it unpleasant."
3,Penhallow Explained,"This is my least favorite book of Georgette Heyer, who is a goddess in my world. When I discovered 22 years ago why she wrote the miserable ending to Penhallow, a tremendous mystery that deserved the ""bad guy"" getting caught, I realized she might even deserve a greater appellation. She couldn't break the contract with her publisher, so she wrote a book that she knew wouldn't sell. Consequently, the publisher broke the contract with her. This book deserves to be read just to see her utter brilliance as a writer."
4,Upside down murder story,"Penhallow is an odd story. Heyer spends about 200 pages introducing Penhallow and his browbeaten family, most of whom want to murder him, before he is finally murdered - and the reader gets to see the murder happen. The police are a side-plot at best.It's a creepy story and all of the main characters have nasty flaws that they let run their lives. I won't go through the list in case I give you a clue about the murder and the final twist in the end. They are compelling enough characters to reread the story but be prepared to do something cheerful afterwards."
5,"Spare, beautifully written, emotionally powerful poems","This book was recommended to me by a psychiatrist who works with adolescents and children, and I could not be more grateful for a book recommendation. With its powerful, haunting poems and black-and-white photographs of Watt's daughter Alexa, ""Hurricane Dancing"" gives you an unsparing look into the heart and mind of a mother of an autistic child. The poems touch on so many emotions, and do so honestly--the joy of the small victories and graces that occur, and the pain that comes with deeply loving a child the world too often doesn't understand or outright rejects. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a child with special needs. I'd recommend it even more strongly to anyone who doesn't have such a child; you will be richer for having read this book."
2,Creativity factor very low,"Although I love fractals, I returned this video. It appears someone figured out a technique to move colorful painting like designs down the Mandelbrot level lines. This technique only is featured at various locations in the M-set with slow panning. No zooms. It looks neat for a few minutes then is just the same all through. But the worst is the horrible music track - nuff said."
4,"Low-cost, reliable DVI-D cable","This is a 2-meter Male/Female dual-link DVD-D cable. It's cheap and definitely is not of the same build quality as Monster Cables but its performance is pretty good. I recommend this unless you absolutely want to pay an arm and a leg for a DVI cable.Remember, this is a male-female cable. Most people need a male-male cable."
5,Great Cable if you need to put your monitor far from your computer,Don't go to far though the signal really gets week. Don't put two of these together to make a longer cable.
2,Not what I wanted!,I ordered this to extend the dvi-d cord for monitor but this extention would not accept the 4 little prongs on either side of the horizontal bar on the female end. I returned it.
3,Fit System 63536H Accord driver side mirror's review,"Easy to install. Works fine. I had the fixed standard mirror on my car, it got smashed by some motorist. I thought that folding mirror would be better as I park by the street very often. It doesn't fold all the way flat(as I had expected), it adds more length to the outer most part of mirror even when folded in. The automatic controls work fine.One drawback that I noticed was it doesn't always maintain the adjustment when you fold it in/out often, which is the whole point of getting a folding mirror. At times it loses the adjustment, I have to check it before starting to drive."
5,el espiritu de la salsa,i loved this doc from hbo films. it closely mirrored my experience getting into the world of latin dancing. it made the point that learning the dance is a journey of self discovery.
3,Left hanging,"Although interesting to follow the people involved and see them progress and perform in 8 weeks, I would have liked to see the actual Santo Rico Dancers showcasing their talents for a comparison point of view. Not everyone is familiar with the fabulous Santo Rico Dancers and it would have been nice to see an example of why they are the best and why everyone wants to learn from them."
2,Disappointing,I bought this for the Barber piece and quite frankly it is turgid and lifeless. Slow tempi do not make a piece more deep and meaningful just slow.
2,Not What I Expected,"It's my fault. I didn't read the information about the CD close enough. I really like Barber's Adagio for Strings. I located this CD when I was in pursuit of music by Samuel Barber. Well, there is only 1 Barber piece on the CD which contains a collection of music that was determined to be ""romantic"". The CD is okay, but not a favorite. I would not recommend it."
5,Good Stephen King Movie,"Its an older movie, with a nobody cast but it is still a great movie all around.I like movies about flying"
4,The Langoliers DVD.,"I enjoyed Stephen King's The Langoliers. I loved the story as I am a sci-fi dude. The way the langoliers were shown, it was 90s effects at it best. It is something to be seen. I will say at least now we have programs you may use to create awesome villians. Dean Stockwell was in this miniseries (Admiral Al Calivicci from Quantum Leap). If you wish to be entertained by sci-fi, watch The Langoliers, you'll laugh. Get with the program! Gotta love Bronson Pinchot as a main anatognist. Recommened for viewing."
2,"Stephen King's ""The Langoliers""","This DVD is not in US version were you can see it using your DVD device. This DVD cannot be used as is in to your device nor using the PC. This is an European version and cannot be read in US. I love the movie, but this DVD has to be converted to US version."
3,I would like to see this gven an improved release.,"If this were released on a better disk with better special effects, this would very much be worth the price. Other than that, it is an okay buy, but it needs much improvement."
3,nifto,"Oh my god!! this movie would have been so awesome if it had been made for the big screen and not for television, if they had a much bigger budget and a few better actors this could have been a great movie. the reason y i give it 3 stars is because of the horrible special effects and the few actors who i will leave annonmus here that overacted and did not do good. On a side note, Mr. Toomy was awesome in this movie the part and the actor just tore it up."
4,If you're into weirdness,"I'm not the kind of person who goes for the gory stuff, so this movie was refreshing. It's very intriguing and chilling. An altogether satisfying deviation from my standard viewings. If you're into creepy weirdness or are a fan of King, then this should satisfy."
4,Guaranteed to give everything one wants in suspense,"The drama that unfolds gives the viewer a sense of urgency and fright, like those of the passengers, to understand the dilemma that their in and how to escape from it."
5,ohhhhhhhh yeahhhhhh,"i looooooooooove this movie. the characters, the plot, the mystery. i loved that dinah character. i remembered the actress who plays her from the 1993 version of the secret garden."
2,Incredible bad special effects..,"While still having memory of the book, I rented this movie. It was okay, but some of the actors was sort of bad. Especially(I don't remember names) the tough hero and the guy that wanted food all the time. What made me give this movie only two stars, was my expectations of the arrival of the langoliers. It was so bad when they came, it was like watching a 80's game of pacman! I fell of the sofa bursting with laughter, and afterwards coulden't take the rest of the movie seriously."
3,Some of the actors suck,"The well known actors in this film were awesome, David Morse was the best. The extras were horrible actors. But the film was decent, suspensival. It was shot cheap and low budget though."
3,It wasn't boogeymen after all.,"I was a little disappointed how this turned out. I had seen the first half many, many years ago, and I was dying to see how it ended. I had it on my N-que wishlist for a year but they never had it to rent, so I ended up having to buy it! I guess it was scarier when I was younger."
2,A remake would be a box office smash,"The movie was made for TV, intended to have many hours. On the big screen, it would have to be a maximum of 100 minutes. It would have better effects, but I would be careful, overdoing it can ruin it. In the version for TV, you easily see the movie could be shorter, many scenes were useless or just too long, shallow dialogues, too still. Thanks."
2,The langoliers DVD,A classic timeless (sorry) story with adequate acting and dated special effects. Nice to revisit now and again. My only complaint regarding this purchase is that it would have to easily be the worst DVD image quality I have ever seen (and I own over 2000 movies on this medium). For this reason I have rated the entire experience quite poorly.
3,Langoliers/TDT,"The Langoliers is a great tv movie (as a mystery). However, this is nowhere near the ""horror"" category. Given, the FX is pitiful. The acting saves it though. That British guy would have been perfect to come back in SK's The Dark Tower saga. Specially, in the last 2 books."
1,Is this a JOKE??,"I am an avid SK fan but found myself being deeply disappointed in this joke of a movie. I have most of SK books and also a large number of videos but find myself embarrassed to tell people that I own it. I made a group of friends watch it from beginning to end and was bombarded with cushions and sofa seats at the end because it was so bad. As yet I havent read the story in night shift, my mother tells me it is very good so I feel i ought to give it a chance, but without her advice, based on the film I would give it a miss. I truly believe that the directors of this film must have been playing a joke on somebody when they set the camera rolling!! Do NOT watch this film unless you are suffereing from dementia and can save yourself by forgetting the plot, storyline and characters names!!!"
2,You'll feel embarrassed for the actors,"...for having to speak the awful dialogue. With the lines Dean Stockwell has to get out, you just feel so sorry for him. He actually has to punctuate his sentences with phrases like ""Dear boy."" Bronson Pinchot's lines are almost as bad, but at least he gets to be crazed. Then there's the psychic deus ex machina girl who saves everybody. Yarggh.On the other hand, if you're a fan of genuinely bad CGI (computer-generated imagery) effects, be sure to see this--these are hands down the worst you'll ever see in a mainstream production! It's like they got their rendering software in a box of cracker jacks--everything's all shiny because that's the easiest to render. It's a wonder they were able to remove hidden lines. The teeth on the langoliers themselves are literally geometric pyramids and conical projections--and they give them close ups anyway! It looks like they lifted their time rift from Fractal Explorer in Kai's Power Tools! These people are shameless!"
1,Hard to believe this [...] exists on film!,"I am so sorry that I wasted my time watching this movie. .....there should really be a law against transferring such a wasteful piece o' s**t onto film! ...This movie features annoying characters, third-rate actors, as well as special effects which were probably created in a high school's film class. And to top it off, the story goes on waaaay too long. .....If you can't avoid this film, then atleast prepare a noose for yourself before pushing the play button."
3,Worth a shot,"Well, a movie taken from a story is almost never to compare to the original but it does entertain. It has a good plot but the acting could use a little bit of help. Defiantly worth watching at least once, but who knows if you'll ever watch it again."
3,"Good concept, low budget","The suspense builds up well, but the resolution is a let-down. Overall, it left me lukewarm and a bit disappointed."
1,Horrible film,"I am a Stephen King fan, and I respected enough of his novella The Langoliers, but I just can't stand the miniseries. The acting is rather poor, and the special effects are even worse than a 70's zombie flick. It's kind of fun at first to watch the build up of the mystery, but then the mystery solved way too easily, and all the fun left the movie. If you are Stephen King fan, then you might like the movie, but if you aren't, then steer clear."
5,One Of King's Finest,This movie is a great showcase to the book. I am into all that old philosophy stuff and there used to be a myth of creatures that would create the world the instant before you looked at it and then destroy it the moment you looked away. I believe this is where king got the idea and I believe that anyone with an open mind and who just wants to be entertained to something different would love this movie.
1,"The Langoliers ate three hours of my present, let alone my past","My 15-year-old daughter and I (both horror fans) kept looking at each other across the room: Really? That's the acting?... That's the storytelling?... Those are the special effects?... That's the dialogue?... We still have another hour left to sit here?... We kept watching out of gritty determination to see it through hoping there would be some pay off... Premise was good and intriguing. All down hill from there, with the pace clearly showing they were trying to squeeze many hours out of a short story.... Once the wooden actress playing the young blind girl spoke her first line of dialogue, I kept wishing she was also mute. And I am not Florida Mom, FYI, I am Florida Dad."
5,Fantastic.,"If you're into special effects big time then pass this one on but if you're just a true movie-lover then this is for you. Fantastic story from the one and only Stephen King. Thrilling from start to finish, nothing comes close. If your a big Stephen King fan check out the novella in 'four past midnight'. Enjoy!"
4,Very good television movie!,"As a little bit like The Stand, The Langoliers is another terrific adaption of Stephen King's novel Four past midnight. The movie is lead by a good cast but lousy visuals effects. Bronson Pinchot is frightningly good as Mr. Toomey who become totally crazy."
4,I liked it!,"Most of the reviews of this film have been less than great. Maybe I'm just a dull person, but I liked it. Good for one of those nights that TV offers nothing, which is getting more frequent."
4,"Next time, take a train","The Langoliers is an okay mystery. It is not a horror movie, it's more of a mystery than horror. With that being said, the movie sticks pretty close to the novella from Four Past Midnight.Ten people on Flight 29 take a strange journey through time...back to yesterday, in fact. There, the air is still, there are no echoes, the sound of steps are dead-sounding and a noise keeps getting nearer and nearer. One of the people is a little girl that's psychic that saves the other people.The CGI is laughable, but CGI was in its infantcy when this movie was made. Stephen King makes a cameo."
4,"Everyone a critic, nobody a writer","Most of the praise and most of the criticisms have some validity (except for the all-caps effusions, which I didn't bother to read).When one considers all the multifarious aspects of a good story -- writer, director, actors, composer et al. -- it's a miracle that any reaches the denouement without limping noticeably.Too, all King's stories seem to have the same themes for a simple reason. They are the only themes, at least the only one's worth writing about: life and its opposite, death; love and its opposite, hate.As for my meaningless rating, four stars. Why? Well, de gustibus non est disputandum. So there!"
5,One of my all time faves,This movie is a fave of mine. The thing I love about it is that it looks so believable. It's eerie but you never know why until the end.
2,The Langoliers Review,"First of all,the movie does keep you on the egde of your seat to know what's going on. The actors are pretty good. Not great but pretty good. But there are still some bad things about the film that I hate like too many plotholes,Bronson Pinchot's over-the-top acting,cliches we have seen a million times over and over again and poor C.G.I. that makes the CGI from the Donkey Kong Country animated series look first-rate. The worst part is the appearance of the titular monsters that look like overcooked meatballs with teeth. It's one of the biggest letdowns in movie history. I give this film a 1 out of 10."
3,The book version is definitely better...,"So much better, in fact, that I feel that I wouldn't have understood the film without reading it first... One of S. King's strengths is his character development, and I don't think that this was passed to the movie. Instead, the movie tried to concentrate on the story line of people 'time traveling'. Now the logic of this story never was very strong, so when you lose the character depth of it, you lose the whole deal...On top of that - the performances were very unconvincing (why does S. King insist on having a cameo in all the films made of adaptions of his books? He's a great writer, but he can't act!) except for Bronson Pinchot, who plays a perferctly neurotic Craig Toomy..."
4,who rained on your paraide?,"This is a really good movie and I just have one question to ask you people WHATS WRONG WITH THE DANG MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!? IT WAS REALY GOOD i thought.it couldnt beat IT though but it was good I dont see why your giving it a bad rating who rained on your paraide? yes , the special efects wernt the greatest the langoliers did kinda look like flying meatballs and it wasnt a horor movie but it was sci fi and i definitly recomend this."
3,Not bad but not good,"The movie does have a compeling story, but lacks in effects, and suffers from serious editing from the book. The acting is not all that bad considering the ""movie story"" but compared to the book, the whole movie is like most of King's movies it starts out really good and bites at the end."
3,not the greatest movie,this movie might have been alright if it hadn't suffered from awkard dialogue which wasnt taken directly from the book other that the interpretation of the langoliers was rather amusing
4,Good television movie,"This Stephen King adaptation of four past midnight is a good movie with very good specials effects. The script is also good even if the dialogs are bad. Fortunaly, the actors help much"
5,This was one of the best movies I have ever seen.,I like Stephen King's Movies. My favorite part is when the langoliers come down and cause the distruction.
1,Bad battery life,This product has the same battery as the Black and Decker VEC157BD 2 Million Power Series 1365 Lumens Spotlight (Tools & Hardware)And is thus equipped with a lead acid battery. Which will die within the first year of usage. I used it only when we are traveling with the RV so thats only 3 to 4 times a year. The battery is already dead and finding a replacement is impossible. And btw replacing the battery is not easy at all and will take some technical experience which is not for everyone.The type of battery is of course totally wrong as that should have been a lithium battery.If you already own one that do not deplete the battery all the way stay above 45% depletion. It might last you more that a year.Anyway total waist of money and a perfect flashlight going to the landfill.
4,Truly masculine,This scent is true to form. It has a solid citrus aroma accented with more herbal tones. Best to apply before dressing.
5,Great light,"portable, bright, switchable with a long lasting batterythat is easily carried. The only change I made was buyinga better case for the battery. This you will certainly need to do.I purchased extra bulbs and use a 10w and 20w in the lightgiving me 3 settings 10, 20, 30w. Difficult to replace bulbs but doable.A good compromise betwwen a pro quailty light and the reallypoor choices for consumer lights."
4,Bescor KLK-624,"Good product. Adds light to a dark situation. The light does not travel far enough, or wide enough, for a big group, when you have to stand back for the wide angle. But it is good for close-up shots, with a small group of people, or for a one-on-one interview. I would buy another with stronger light."
3,distance use,"good for interviews with a soft filter, not good for shooting over anything past 20 feet."
3,Good Meditations- Bad Setup,"I enjoyed Christopher P's book immensely and love that he created a CD companion with the meditations. However, I found I almost never use it because of the way the meditations are lumped into one section. I can understand why he did it that way (somewhat) but I still find it extremely frustrating. If I find I have to skip something or go back it completely ruins the meditative state I'm in. It's a shame because out of all the books he's written this one could really use the CD companion!!! Overall, if you are like me I wouldn't bother buying this... I've only attempted to use it a handful of times and finally gave up. (I do highly highly recommend the book though!!! Just not the CDs to go with it.)"
1,Flawed,Mine rotted and leaks all over the kitchen counter! Had to throw it out. Tried gluing it everything. Would think water wouldn't be a problem.
2,Rusted Away,With only moderate use this stylish design produced unsightly rust around the neck of the bottle and dispenser hole - needed to be replaced - not a good deal.
2,"Works fine, but encourages mold.","After several years of regular use, pump works well, and metal doesn't rust. Container holds plenty of soap (about 3/4 of a bottle). But, the sponge holder has no ventilation or drainage. There's always moisture at the bottom, and sponges get moldy, despite being well squeezed. Metal scrubs tend to rust for same reason."
2,Nice Looking for about a week,This product was nice looking when I received it but in a matter of a week it started to slowly rust around the top and has continued to do so. I was so upset but I had to throw it away after only a month of use. Not worth the money. Great concept but doesn't last.
2,Mildew Making Machine,"POSITIVEI bought this to replace a motion sensor dispenser that failed in order to go back to basics. It is a simple, sturdy, and practical design.NEGATIVEThe major flaw with this product is that the scrub pad/sponge holder has no holes at the bottom. Even if you ring out the water from a sponge, as best you can, placing it in the attached holder creates a mildewed sponge in a short amount of time. I end up just placing my sponge on top of the holder rather than in it to avoid ruining the sponge and getting mildew odor."
2,It leaks from the bottom if you can believe it...,"One of the best and long lasting pumps I have ever had, but it now sits on top of a sponge to absorb the soap that leaks out of the bottom. Such a shame too... It's an all metal bottom but they managed to leave a little hole in it. It I had a soldering iron I might try to fix it myself."
4,"Sweet, Entertaining, Nostalgic","""Cursed by a Happy Childhood"" is a memoir about growing up on the eastern end of Long Island (the North Fork), 100 miles east of Manhattan, in a rural setting. (This is not the Long Island of suburban/urban Nassau County, but of a far more rural, sheltered place, east of the corn fields and north of the touristed Hamptons.) The author wrote the memoir as a series of vignettes filled with both reflections on his own mostly innocent childhood paired with advice for his own tween-aged daughter. It is sweet, largely positive, and endearing. The ten-page postscript is the largest detractor of this book: it appears to have been written separately from the rest of the memoir (perhaps an earlier, shorter version), often repeating vignettes, examples, and phrasing from earlier in the book; it seems to have been incorporated last minute and appears to have escaped the red ink of the editor as there are numerous typos. Read the book, but skip the last 10 pages."
4,Works like promised.,"I read other reviews and I have used this item app. 25 times now and it works just fine, it workes like my old original one did 15 yrs. ago. The automatic function to load and unloed is good."
3,revised,"The AMBICO VHS-C to VHS Adapter worked for approximately 10 cassettes. Then the door switch stopped working and became free wheeling. It is no longer working as I cannot open or shut the door where you load the cassettes. With shipping, the cost was $62.98. I expect better quality for the price. I will be contacting the company to see if they will replace the Adapter. Will write another review based on customer service later.July 5 I have to commend the customer service for this product. I no sooner requested that the defective product discussed above be replaced than I received an e-mail that a new cassette was being sent to me. It arrived today. I hope the issue with the door switch will not be a problem with this cassette. The first one performed beautifully until I had that problem. It is nice to know that the company and Amazon stand by their merchandise. Thank you."
1,Product is Crap. Don't Waste your Time or Money.,"I never leave negative feedback. Product was crap. Wouldn't work with ANY VHS C tapes I tried. I'm glad I read the reviews and tried UNIMPORTANT tapes first. Could have been a disaster. This product should not even be up for sale. I had one of these back in the day, and I know how they are supposed to work. Shame on this seller for peddling this junk. I am wanting to get my video projects going. This took my time and my money. Neither of which I'll ever get back. Again, shame on this seller."
1,THIS SLOW COOKER IS AWFUL! COOKS TOO HOT,"Slow Cookers should do just that....slowly cook over a long period of time without the meat/chicken/etc. drying out. Both times I used it resulted in overly cooked chicken and beef on the LOW setting. The juices were boiling, which shouldn't be the case on LOW heat. It will be returned...I'm planning on replacing it with the West Bent 84765."
2,One Fatal Flaw,"A six quart cooker ought to have non-slip feet, but this item has the exact opposite - three enameled metal bumps on the bottom that are virtually frictionless. One little nudge and this thing slides quite freely across a counter top. Not good for a product meant to hold six quarts of scalding hot food for long periods of time. And if the ceramic pot liner should break, you can't get a replacement - everyplace that once sold them stopped because they almost always break in shipping."
4,Hamilton Beach 33163 Stay Or Go 6 Quart Oval Slow Cooker,The best purchase I've made in quite awhile. I don't know how I've cooked without one. Thanks for stocking this item.
2,impulse buy goes awry,"I bought this crock pot, one, because it was on sale at a local store for 19.99, and two, because unlike most crock pots out there, it has those sturdy metal handles. Before I bought it, I noticed the rubber gasket around the inside of the lid, but didn't think twice, because, well, $19.99! But then I took it home, washed it, and filled it with some already cooked pot roast and vegetables and set it on ""warm"" for a couple hours. Long story short, the nice hot condensation built up on the rubber and then dripped down into the food and made it taste like rubber. For all I know, the smell/taste diminishes after awhile, but it occurred to me that this item is made in China (of course), where manufacturers don't have a great track record for product safety when it comes to lead, etc. So why take a chance? I packed it up and returned it. I've ordered a Rival crockpot off of Amazon (no gaskets, thank you), and I'm keeping my fingers crossed inside my oven mitts!"
2,Cracked Insert - TWICE,"My 41 year old Sears crockpot is still going strong, but I was tired of the avocado and gold mushroom motif!! And, quite often, when cooking for a crowd, I have two crockpots going at once. I decided to splurge for a new one and chose the Hamilton Beach Stay or Go Slow Cooker. While I was at it, I also purchased one for my niece. My crock cracked last week during use. When I called my niece to tell her, she said that hers had cracked several months ago. Apparently, there is nowhere to get a replacement crock. I will NEVER buy another one of this brand!"
2,Cooks way too Hot,"I rarely use my crock pot. It has a hot spot that burns the food everytime I use it. So needless to say I don't use it as much as I would like. Burns the food in the hot spot area on the low setting, never use the high setting way too hot. Also I think the crock is really heavy and hard to handle for clean-up."
1,Misleading,"This product did not work for me, when I inquired to the company about this product, they informed me that maybe I needed 2 to bring about the desired effect. I told them they can keep this 1, it is being returned. ASAP"
4,Mollys Puppy Tale,"The American Girls Collection are good books to read. They teach you sharing, caring, and friendship. These books are great to read and so much fun.In this book, Molly's Puppy Tale, Molly learns how to share. Molly just got a new dog, Bennett, and she has been bragging to her friends how Bennett loves her and comes when he is called. When she gets home with her friends she realizes her brother Rickey has been playing with Bennett and Molly thinks that Bennett likes Ricky better than her. So Molly decided to not share Bennett with Ricky, and Bennett dose not like it. One day Molly had girl scouts and she doesn't come straight home to Bennett, and he tour apart Molly's room. So Molly had to stop her after school activities. It was too much for Molly, so she decided to share Bennett with Ricky.The author wanted to write about a dog because she has a dog just like Bennett. Her dog is loving, and friendly. So far he chewed up five welcome mats."
3,Interesting Collection,Interesting collection of music but pershaps some a little reminiscent of band tunes. Some of the house mixes were nicely mixed.
3,let's not get all teary-eyed yet...,"ok, this cd makes the cut, it's still in my collection, but to say ""ooooh and ahhh""... chill!... some tracks were played too long and lost meaning after a while, this serves more as a mid-day mix rather than something you'd really listen and get down to. Ole' Frank could've tweaked and freaked here and there, got his hands a lil' dirty... this ""clean mixing"" trend is yaaawwwn, too San Fran for my taste..."
5,Wonderful Survey Of Nutty Royalty,"Wonders abound in this whimsical survey of rulers throughout history, focusing on those who were either crazy or tyrannical. It's a series of anecdotes about both well-known and obscure rulers, from Queen Victoria (who was not as prudish as history sometimes holds) to Bokassa, who went from absolute ruler to pauper in exile. Did you know, for example, that Queen Victoria's father was an avowed socialist?The book is essentially a collection of short entries and so is more suited to light than detailed reading, but I've read it 4 or 5 times now, and it always holds its vaule to me. Mr. Randall is to be congratulated for producing a worthwhile work."
2,ok,This item is awesome looking. Im wide receiver and line backer and its all scratched up. It sucks in rain to . It also gets your sweat on it and its blurry.we have 8 game season and i wore it for half of them cuz i couldnt see as well
1,Yet Another Fake Steely Dan CD,This CD is just another in the long list of unauthorized Steely Dan CD's that all contain the same songs.
1,Yellow Snow,"Why does Amazon even sell this? The title ""Yellow Peril"" is well taken, although perhaps ""Yellow Snow"" would be more apt. The Dan deserve the royalties they earn from their legitimate releases. I wish Amazon would stick to them."
4,An excellent summary of the Perceval tradition.,"The less-than-perfect ranking is simply because Weston's work has been superseded in many areas by modern Arthurian scholars. This study of the Perceval legend is still one of the few places you can find a thorough overview of the entire collection of Grail stories that feature Sir Perceval as the hero. Weston includes many variants that are hard-to-find, unusual, and obscure. Her love of the Celtic-origin hypothesis and her pet notion that folklore and myth developed from ancient rituals color most of her commentary. Even so, the study was influential in its day and still holds value for the modern scholar."
4,Count Belisarius - Byzantine Rome's Greatest General,"This was a fine book by a great author. While ""Goodbye to All That"" undoubtedly was Graves' best work, ""Count Belisarius"" runs a close second. Graves takes us on a journey through the unbelievable achievements of this extradorinarily virtuous man who was so little appreciated by his emperor. Graves puts his own spin on some of the historical events in the novel - or at least he disagrees with some earlier historians - but the novel is well written and gives a great insite into the causes for Rome's decline and eventual collapse."
4,Look to the source,"This book may not be one of Graves' best but in the spirit of Gibbon, he captures his sources well. However, for entertainment and a more immediate sense of the history, you may find it more worth your while to read Graves' source: Procopius, The Wars (not The Secret History!). It is less sentimental and gives a more edgy account of Belisarius' struggles and incomprehensible end."
1,This ain't worth it,"As a huge fan of Claudius and a lesser fan of some of Graves' other works this one comes at the very bottom of my list of preferred RG titles. The plot is ungainly, the action is plodding and the overall point to the novel seems obscured by Graves greater interest in the wider view of Roman society, which is all very well but goes unexplored in the text.After the directness of the persona in 'I, Claudius', I was shocked by the boredom induced by this book.Re-read 'Claudius' for the thirtieth time, its a better and more entertaining use of time than this."
1,Disappointing,"An outdated work, neither very useful nor entertaining. Whatever relevance this book might have had when it was published 18 years ago has long since passed. Don't waste your money."
1,Absolute Garbage,I bought this book because of the review that was listed showing it to be a very good purchase. Wow was that review wrong...Anyone who has ever read a good revenge book can tell that this book is not worth the paper or bindings holding it together; very impractical and filled with garbage stories that either read bad or simply make no sense at all. I could put a better book together than this one in 10 minutes and it would have more revenge tactics than this garbage book lists...I want my money back...make sure you keep yours and buy a different book
4,Ginny's first winter with a pony of her own.,"Ginny finally has a pony of her own. For her and Mokey, the winter is full of adventure and surprises! (sequel to ""Summer Pony"""
4,"a Great book, for ethno-celtic-musicology, etc.","Any non-bluegrass type of mandolin Family interest would do well having this book, TRULY. HOWEVER, make no mistake. This will get you nowhere in producing a Bluegrass Mandolin. As long as that is understood. Nobody else will make the same mistake I made."
3,Good book for a builder...but no full sized plans,I gave it a 3 since I had hoped to have FULL size plans in the book. Otherwise it is well done...even though it gives measurements in metrics.
4,"Good phone with all feeatures, but lack voice quality","I bought this phone because it has two lines and sometimes I do conferencing. It has good features, basically what i wanted:- 2 lines, cordless and speaker phone. But, it lacks in voice quality. The voice is gone for some seconds in the middle, which irritates a lot sometimes."
3,Decent phone for a low price.,"I purchased this phone to replace a 2.4GHz Panasonic 2 line phone. I needed another handset and the older Panasonic was too high. I thought the 5.8 GHz would have better range. I was planning on using a second handset and charger in another building about 100 yards from the house to give me intercom service to the house and a phone out there. The GE starts to get a little choppy at the building and loses signal as soon as I enter. The Panasonic 2.4GHz with it's 2 antenna base has slightly better range than the 5.8GHz GE which has no external antenna on the base. Although the sound is good on the GE, my Panasonic has better sound and has speakerphone on the handset. I wish for my situation I had purchased a Panasonic 5.8GHz phone. For most people this would not be an issue. The only other problem I have with the phone is it takes 4 AA batteries. I haven't put them in yet and it keeps resetting the time."
2,Wouldn't stay charged,"These were bought for my office and I'm sad to have to replace them after 6 months. First, other reviews are correct, the sound quality is horrible. Many times I can barely hear the person on the phone. Second, I've had to replace the battery already once. It's cheaper to buy a new phone than to continously purchase rechargeable batteries every month. Not happy with this product."
1,only for the photos,"Indeed, truly awful recipes. Although each seems a clever concoction and is assigned a truly lovely and inspiring photo, the actual results are at best comparable to mouth wash. Unless you are interrogating a possible serial killer for location of body parts, I can't think of one good reason you would actually serve these drinks to human beings, or in fact anything in the primate family. Avoid. Talk to an actual bar tender for your drink recipes."
5,"Sesmark Rice thins, Sesame","A few years ago, I began looking for Gluten-Free crackers and pastas to have on hand for a pending visit from my daughter who has a severe gluten allergy. I sampled several packages of different brands and types from the specialty stores. I found the Sesmark Rice Thins to be very tasty but EXPENSIVE (consider the source).So, I thought why not see if Amazon carries anything similar for a more reasonable price. I did find them on Amazon and the cost is half of what I could buy them for in any retail store.This is one of the most delicious crackers I have ever eaten. Try them with a very sharp white Cheddar like Cabot's.....umm,umm,good."
1,mfr skimpin on ingredients,"I ordered 2 cases as always. Rvc'd the 2 cases and the crackers were saltless, tastless. Amazon was kind to send 2 more cases and they were the same. BLAH! I have written the masnufacturer to let them know.Amazon has greta customer care."
4,Bet you can't eat just one...,"And that's part of the problem. No, really, I can eat just a few, maybe more later.These thins are not quite as thin as I'd prefer (nor am I), but make a good snack. For hors d'oeuvres, if you top them with anything moist, do a few at a time; they get soggy pretty fast."
3,Like them but too salty,I buy these crackers because I need something gluten free to snack with. But why does gluten free have to be so salty? I have to wipe the salt off to be able to eat them. Wish the manufacturers would learn that just because we are glten free doesn't mean we can eat all that salt. Less salt please!
4,"Nice model tiger; not a rough playtoy, though.","I bought this model toy for my one-year-old girl, after being disappointed with the quality and accuracy of most 'toy' animals available at toystores. I was looking for a realistic model animal.This arrived and although quite small, it is realistic and detailed. Solid plastic, it stands without falling over and it's quite nice. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is that it scuffs very easily. My daughter dropped it on the sidewalk once (the day she got it), and it ended up with two scuff marks where the plasic scratched up and the paint was rubbed off away.Overall, it's a great model animal, and it these were a little less expensive, I would buy them all rather than the 'toy' animals made by other comanies. Just keep in mind that it is best displayed or played with gently."
2,Recycled,"Made in UK in 2000, Serial# ESMCD-879, Playing Time 79:29Yes, he's the man who recorded ""Baker Street""...But this album isn't about that; and careful with the ""best of"" in the title.This CD is made up of 2 things: a) the first 13 tracks are in fact GR's 1st solo album, 1971's ""Can I Have My Money Back?""; b) the next 12 tracks make up a ""best of"" from material of his previous collaboration, the HUMBLEBUMS, recorded back in 1969 and 1970.So if you're thinking about getting a ""best of"" of Gerry Rafferty (covering later material), there's quite a few out there.This is a ""Best Of 1969-1971""..."
2,Just doesn't live up to claims,"I purchased this DVD player because I needed something that would work on 220 as well as 110. Mostly I use it to play NTSC DVDs.I have not been happy with this player at all. The decoder can't seem to keep up with some movies. It doesn't matter if they are action movies or slow dramas. The player will freeze or worse occassionally jump ahead by a chapter. Sometimes you'll be watching a movie and the jump will appear to be a regular scene change. When you back up to try and figure out what you missed, you find it's all or part of a chapter.I thought that maybe a firmware upgrade would help but this company doesn't really have any support web sites.This one is going into the kids play room. I'm sticking with brand names from now on. I would not buy this thing."
4,great looking line,"I bought this to use with my 2008 harley sportster. Looks good, works as intendid. Gets rid of the squishy feel from the rubber lines. Mine only came with one fitting, not sure if its suppose to or what. Other than that will buy again when I go with bigger bars."
4,Excellent beginner's guide to the use of films & filters,"I thought excellent comparisons of the various types of color reversal films available and which work best given the seasonal subjects and what you're trying to capture. Also good suggestions on the effect of various filters. Very good, instructional photos throughout."
4,Puching Bag,"This product was very good, the only thing a bought it for an 8 year old, and he is kind of big for it.I recommend it for younger then 8."
1,Terrible Product,"this item arrived and the smell of the material was so horrid, i had to leave it outside for 5 days and it still smelled bad. Then after 1 day of use, the strap broke off and the stitching tore apart. A terrible product"
2,Fell apart in ten minutes - not for kids older than 4,"My 7 year old and 5 year old boys took wacks at this bag for about five minutes each before the bag ripped off the rope. Low low quality - I think it may only be appropriate for 3-4 year olds.Yes my kids were hitting it hard, but not hanging off of it or doing anything other than punching it with their hands. Its a punching bag so I assumed it could handle a pummeling from two little kids. Obviously not.Also the gloves would never properly fit any child - the room for the hands is proper but then the wrist straps - essential to keeping them on - are made for adult size wrists. I ended up using tape to keep them tight on each child. This was fine but also disappointing that the people who designed this product didnt bother to check the wrist sizes of children."
3,Size,Looks way bigger in picture. Was bought for my 9 year old and it's perfect for my 4 year old lil girl.
1,Punching bag rip off,"This product turns out to be a joke. Heavy bag was 10"" tall and weighs less thaan 2 pounds. Gloves are for a 2 year old."
3,very small,i bought this for an otistic child its a lot flemseier than i expected.im afraid that it will swing back an hit him. :(
1,Didn't even last a second.,I picked it up from its straps and it tears immediately. Not even one hit. Hopefully my sister in law can sew it back together. Worst Christmas gift ever. My nephew was never able to use it.
2,Incredibly small!,"I was so excited to get this for my 6 year old son. He's got a lot of energy and I figured a punching bag would be great!When the package came it was in a tiny box. I opened it and took the bag and gloves out and could not believe how small it was. (The gloves were normal size and seemed to be sturdy) But I'm 5'5 and the actual bag comes to my knees. It's obviously shorter than a 6 year old (or a 2 year old for that matter). So I figured I'd try to hang it, but there is nothing at the top to hang it by? It's just tied off at the top.I never send anything back, so I will end up keeping it for my son to use his imagination with, but I was let down with product this for sure."
4,A nice PeeWee set,This is nice for a small kid. My son is 6 and we got it for him- and it's pretty good for his size. The issue we have is it's very light- so the bag bobs around everywhere... makes him feel like Rocky- but he's not really connecting as well as he could be. I would say it is GREAT exercise as even my husband and I spent time swinging at it...
1,Don't Buy,"The Seller don't stand behind their product. I have a 4 year old boy that used it 2 days maybe about 1 hour max.The rope that holds it broke while he was hitting it. He Never hung on it, I was there the whole time, and we spent alot of money on this. After I bought this on Amazon I saw it for cheaper in the store and now I wish I would have done just that. Stores reimburse you for products that don't work. You should stand behind a product that don't work too. My advise is don't buy this because if anything goes wrong they don't stand behind there products."
1,Ripped after a couple punches by my 7 year old,"The straps for hanging this bag broke after a couple of punches by my 7 year old. (The thread they used to stitch the bag and straps is too fine and fragile.) Description states ""Ages 7 and up"", but it's probably more appropriate for a 4-5 year old. (However, the gloves are plenty big, even for a 7 year old.) Also, you need to get creative about finding something low enough to hang this from. If you use a rope to hang it from a doorway, it will sway too much after each punch. Measures 18"" tall x 7"" diameter and 3 pounds."
4,Fun,My seven year old uses it to play. I wouldn't like it if we were serious about kickboxing or karate etc.. but it makes him feel like he's Rocky :). My only complaint with it is that we didn't have anywhere to hang it. We had to hang it up in the doorway to his room from a nail and we have to take it down when he's not using it.
3,A pretty decent read,"Alice Rowe is a young woman who paying for the sins of her mother. Living with the local Reverend has helped but there are those who are still against her. When the Rev. Markham goes missing, Alice finds him dead and she also meets Gideon Davy, a ""ganger"" who is laying a near by train tracks. Though a series of events both Alice and Gideon find themshelves in the Crimea. Gideon, who is trying to lay tracks to help the British war effort and Alice who nursing the fighting men.""Paths of Destiny"" is a pretty good book by E.V. Thompson. The author does a pretty good job of showing the reader the conditions that were faced by the soldiers and their families during the conflict. The story between Alice and Gideon was good and I really enjoyed it. Overall ""Paths of Destiny"" is a good book but I had wished that it had been longer"
1,High in the running for worst album ever,"I accidentally purchased this album thinking it was by the band The Divine Comedy (who are quite good btw!). This album is so horrible I don't dare ""review"" it except to say its hideous. I'm throwing the disc out."
5,Definitely worth it.,"I would rather buy this $40 tool and an hour of my time to replace my spark plugs than pay someone $150 to do it for me. The next time, all it will take is the spark plugs and another hour. It it plug and play, so it really couldn't be easier to use and it works like a charm. All you need is a socket wrench, one socket for the tool, one socket for the bolts on the mounts, and a wrench for nuts on the mounts. Super Simple."
2,Not her best work,"I loved the Dead-End Job series, and couldn't wait to read more from Elaine Viets, but this book was a major disappointment. Elaine could have done so much better with the storyline, and left out about 100 pages of filler. Imagine having a heated discussion with your mother and all of a sudden yelling ""GBH"". Everyone stops what they are doing and saying and gives a ""Great Big Hug"". Gag me.The premise of the book was good, but there was too much time spent on dialog with Josie's mother, which went over and over the same things. If I wouldn't have been on an airplane with only the 1 book to read, I probably would have set it aside and reached for something else."
3,A good read...until the end,"This is my first book that I've read by this author. Overall, the book was good with twists to the plot. However, the book fizzled for me near the end when Josie was attending the memorial service. That is when she had her ""AHA"" moment about who the killer was. I didn't understand why all of a sudden it hit her, but then again I figured out the killer's identity about half way through. After the killer confessed, I just read through the next pages just to finish the book. By this time, I was just really bored. Needless to say, I will read the next installment of the series. I've heard good things about this author, so may be I'll read her other books as well."
5,garlic lover,"I bought this garlic baker for myself and a friend because I am always using my daughter's baker. The garlic comes out perfect! We serve the cloves right out of the bulb with pesto, goat cheese and toasted slices of our favorite baguette. Very easy, attractive and tasty!"
5,Excellent deal.,"Good dinnerware. Does not break. Could be used in microwave. Excellent for kids or a regular super meal. Very easy to clean. Some of the plates did bend a tiny bit out of shape. I'm not sure from what but when I stack them up it isnt exact, this isnt a problem that should worry you unless you are a perfectionist."
4,Barry & Glodean CD,"Product arrived timely and sender's comments about cd's condition was accurate. Would order again from this sender.This item was purchased as a gift, and the receiver is enjoying this lovely music."
4,A bit of nostalgia,"I fondly remember this from my boyhood days. I loved it then, the rewatching was just as warm. The special effects are good when considered with due regard to the time the movie was released. Guy Williams is at his swashbuckling best, the villians are as over the top as one would hope for. Suspend your ""grown up"" notions of what makes a ""good"" film, kick back, relax with a bowl of pop corn and indulge yourself with some solid escapism. If you are able, gather the littlies around you and educate them in the joys of simplicity from a bygone time. Enjoy!"
2,Hokey Weirdness Only Reason to Watch,"I only bought this video for the weird ""Spider Woman"" sequence (which comes out of nowhere), and which seems like an inspiration for the Logans Run Carousel sequence. Other than that, if you are willing to just laugh at this hokey production, you will have fun. (don't take any of it seriously--including the special effects)"
4,captain sindbad,"This is one of the great movies for the young at heart. It has it it all,comedy ,love,adventure and suspense.Its a typical Arabian nights movie with plenty of monsters,sword play and a hero who is invincible."
5,captain sinbad,"Yeah, I had copy VHS longtime from HBO cable or Cinimax then I play, that cool wow I look for DVD and Please don't blame people cuz they forget about this title! Please tell co to make to sell DVD I believe that People will happy to hear about it and they will buy! :-) I want to buy DVD this title before I die cuz I'm 56 yrs old! Thank for keep all titles! also The Company made many old movies to sell DVD not right cuz they didn't make DVD this title first than Classics! they sell old movies explain ""Franketien vs werewolf"", Hercules, Draucla as many classic movies DVD! :-) Chester"
1,What a P.O.S.,What can I say? A truly sad movie. Special effects suck out loud. The acting is just as bad. Why oh why did I spend good money on this P.O.S. Even Eye Of The Tiger blows this away. The animated Sinbad Of The Seven Seas is leaps and bounds better than this crap. Avoid this movie at all costs unless it's for a 5 year old.
1,bad sinbad bad,"couldn't wait to get my copy sounded so good.... yuck yuck yuck I thought this video would be somewhat like the other Sinbad movies. If only some of the production money could have been spent on special effects, script and talent. Guy Williams was one of my favorite actors, must have needed the money. I can't imagine what he was thinking. what a stinker!!!!!"
3,I Love Sinbad But.....,"I really love Sinbad movies they're full of excitement great story telling and fantasy. This one though was a little disappointing to say the least. What makes this one so bad is the special effects. There also is some pretty lame acting on this film. Guy Williams is a pretty decent Sinbad,but the rest of the actors were just short of terrible. I'm glad I bought the movie to see it for myself,but not completely happy with it. The movie is very clear and very colorful so I don't have any complaints in that department. I would only recommend this movie to a Sinbad completist, for anyone else, you might want to pass on this one."
5,Very nice automotive charger!,Smaller and lighter than the typical difficult to store metal cased automotive charger. Fully automatic which all battery chargers should be (safer that way). Great cable management which most chargers lack completely. Best bang for the buck as far as I can tell.
2,Not for ships!,"After a call to Schumacher today, I felt it in the interest of potential buyers to be very careful about application of this product. It is NOT a ""marine"" battery charger. By marine, I mean one that can be used aboard a vessel (ship,boat) that is in the water. It does NOT have isolation and you will make a battery out of your entire vessel and what will suffer is your underwater metal fittings. A proper marine grade (isolated) charger will cost more initially, but is much less expensive than a new prop or a sunk vessel due to a thru-the-hull metal fitting being eaten away. Just a note of caution."
3,Good - Not Great,"I liked the light weight and the fast charging capability for the price. I use it almost exclusively to charge deep cycle batteries on my boat. When it is happy with a battery it works flawlwssly, but when it doesn't like a battery it goes to an error indication - no definitions supplied. The battery it does not like gets charged properly using another manufacturer's automatic charger."
4,A little noisy..,"I bought this for the desulfation feature to try to refurbish a dead battery and it worked pretty well. Nice compact size. It took a lot longer than the manual said it would but the truck now starts and runs fine. Cables were beefy enough and hid away in a secret compartment which was nice for portable use. The digital meters were a big plus as you might usually expect an analog which just measures voltage and says your battery is ""good"" when it is really bad. I had one minor problem. I left it hooked up to my truck on trickle over night and it never really turned off and its fan made a lot of noise. My wife complained that I was going to blow up the garage when she heard it going in the morning. Then, I jumped in the truck with it still hooked up and promptly ran over it and smashed it to smithereens on the 3rd day of ownership. It worked pretty good before all that happened."
2,Great when it works.,"Having bought this used online for a good price might have been not such a good idea. The product seems to have some issues with keeping the accurate reading for percent battery is charged. I need to unplug it and plug it in again to get it to read correctly.Also, a short while after I got it, it started making a sound like the fan was out of whack. I noticed when I lay it on its back it helps but now and then I have to smack it to get it to stop.Wish I new if there was a fix to this.Otherwise it seems to charge just fine.Cheers,Joe"
5,Schumacher SSC-1500A Very Good,I just wrote the review in the title. I am very satisfied with the product and the delivery time.
3,Needs a better more accurate display,"I like the extra power this charger gives me over my old 8 Amp charger. It does shave hours off of the charge time.What I do not like is the display. My 35 year old charger always showed what amperage it was charging at. So as the battery was fully charged, the amp would show zero. You always knew when or how close you where to being fully charged.But this charger has no such display. It does have a meter that supposedly tells you the batteries charge percent, but it doesn't work right. It will show a battery at 100% charged, even though the battery needs charging. The readout is just unreliable and unusable. I had to go buy an amp meter so I can tell what is going on.If this manufacturer added an amp meter to this product, or if the % charge meter really worked right, I would have rated it 5 starr."
4,Nice Compact Charger,"I have used the charger on quite a few different batteries and it has performed well on all of them. I had a couple of gel cells I was hoping it would bring back from the dead but no go. It has some nice features that other chargers don't have, that make it easy to determine the condition of your battery. I'm thinking about purchasing a couple as gifts for family members."
5,Saved me from buying a new battery.,"ATV battery has to be charged for every use the last two years. All set to buy because it just won't hold the charge. Bought this product , the first time placed it on small battery setting. After overnight charging the message bad battery came out. I decided to try again and placed setting on medium size battery. The next morning it was finished charging. Battery has been working since then even on cold show days as I use the ATV with a snow plow attachment. Fan isn't really that loud. Definitely will recommend product."
5,Excellent Product,The charger works great! I bought this unit to charge and maintain batteries at our lake cabin. The options and functions are sipmle to use and understand. The digital display is useful to monitor charge status. I recommend this product to anyone in need of a small charger.
3,Schumacher SSC-1500A,"So far this product is exactly as described.My only complaint is that it has a small fan that stays on even after the battery has been fully charged on a 2amp trickle charge setting. It would have been nice that once the battery has been fully charged (100% charged), the battery would turn itself off along with the fan. That is the main reason for the 3 star rating."
1,is a real waste,"do not buy this product, use only 2 times and already damage, take a hammer and in particular bits of anger and helplessness I had the need to charge a battery in time of emergency and the unit is not served, with only 2 uses, is a real waste"
5,Review,"Exactly what I needed,it has also helped me with looking for new batteries. Sizing and maintaining them I recommend this model"
3,Schumacher 1500A,"As others have noted, the percent-charged reading can be grossly misleading. My experience is that when it shows 100%, you can expect to continue charging for another couple of hours before reaching full charge. Other than that, this charger works well. The biggest consideration with this product, however, is life expectancy. While this charger comes with a five year warranty, you are unlikely to get anywhere near that before it dies. This has been my experience with several Schumacher battery chargers. Unfortunately, there is almost nothing in the way of comparable items by other makers to choose from."
2,This charger may not be good for certain AGM batteries,"Some AGM batteries specified charging voltage of no more than 14.4V, but this charger will go up to 15.6V, and it stays at 15.6V for about 50% of the maintenance mode pulses.This is way too overvoltage and could damage your battery, shorten the lifetime of it. I found it out the hard way.Protect your AGM battery, be careful when you choose your charger, just because they ""said"" it's for AGM , doesn't mean it's always 100% fool proof."
5,Very satisified,This is a quality product at a great price point. It does exactly what I need for my auto and deep cycle batteries. I am also pleased with the compactness and the length of the warranty.
4,Schumacher SSC-1500A Charger,"I read the reviews on this charger and I was hoping it would bring back my AGM battery. I followed the advice of others when the charger stated the battery was ""BAD"" and restarted the charge cycle. It took 5 tries, but it finally fully charged by AGM battery. I will not leave the battery connected in the car next winter. But the charger did bring it back from being completely dead. I have not used this charger in any other application at this point. But for what I used it for, it worked for me."
4,Almost perfect,"User manual and the display button is a bit confusing. The user manual shows 4 selections for the battery type but the unit only shows 3 (missing the marine battery). The fan is noisy and if you leave it on 24/7, better put it somewhere outside the house, maybe in the garage."
3,Fine,I am not a big poetry person but the words were so descriptive! I really felt part of the book.
3,Our Thoughts of HEARTBEAT!,"This is our other review and we couldn't resist but to share more with you! Megan and I also were stunned with what a great job Sharon Creech did in writing this book! It was amazing to read, connect, infer, and predict with! We enjoyed reading it so much. We also liked how the book gave so many detailed descriptions of Annie and Max's personalities. It really gave us a better picture of what their characters were like. The setting also jumped around a bit from her house, to the track field, to running on paths, and even the hospital where Annie's brother was born! In the end, this book was quite amazing and if you are looking for an enjoyable attension-catcher book to read...this is the perfect book for you!!!"
5,This is a beautiful book,"I've just finished listening to Heartbeat on CD and it was phenomenal! The poetry and the sounds of the words were so awesome that it made me cry several times. I have to say that this book has opened my eyes to so many possibilities, and has encouraged my love for reading even more. I am going to buy the book because I love to read, and I am going to buy the CD because listening to Heartbeat is so amazing. Thank you Sharon for writing such a touching book. I really love it! I am listening to it again today :)"
3,Heartbeat,"This book was interesting and confusing at the beginning, but further into the book we started to understand things. Like why they called the book, Heartbeat. Also why they said, ""Thump-thump, Thump-thump!"", throughout the story. We could connect to the situations in the book. One was that Megan and I both run for enjoyment just like Annie and Max do. Another is that Megan has a little brother named Joey as well. Everyone should enjoy this book and think that it is a fantastic read! Also, it was under eight bucks so it is affordable! Now that we have shared the book with you a bit, go purchase it and read it yourself!"
3,Why are we here on this earth?,"HeartbeatBook Written By: Sharon CreechRun, run, run. That's what Annie, a kind free-thinking twelve-year-old girl, loves to do. Her friend Max, a competitive and moody thirteen-year-old boy, is now giving her a hard time until the point that she has to hurt him. What will Annie do?Everything starts to change for young Annie. Her mom is pregnant, her Grandpa is now fragile and forgetful, and of course Max, more rude and even more moody than ever! And Annie, she suddenly starts to realize and understand the rhythms of life and how she fits with them with each step she takes. Heartbeat is a wonderful story that lets you explore the train of Annie's thoughts, emotions, and lifelong questions that she may never figure out.I recommend this book for anyone-people of all ages-whether you're an adult or a young child. This question will keep you wondering just as it did me, ""Why are we here on this earth?"""
4,A lovely story in verse,"Sharon Creech demonstrates again her talent in shaping a moving story in verse in ""Heartbeat"". This is the story of a preadolescent Annie, who is juggling the normal pressures of growing up with family stress caused by both joy and tragedy. Annie's mother is pregnant and her grandfather suffers from progressive dementia. We also see Annie struggle with her friendship with Max, a slightly older boy with whom Annie shares the love of running.Creech's ability to weave Annie's thoughts and feelings within highly creative verse with loads of rhythm is impressive. The meter of the verse coincides with the action within the story, including Max and Annie's running sessions and the wonderful discovery of her soon to be born sibling's heartbeat.This book is a must for kids who love poetry and would be a great introductory text for those who aren't sure!"
1,Leaves out important health information,"Having read the wonderful, ""Bichon Havanese""by Zoila Portuondo Guerra, I was very disappointed with this book, since it completely ignored health issues that should be watched in the breed. The book seems quite generic in nature and could apply to almost any breed."
1,General puppy book - Not really on Havanese,"Although this was the only book on Havanese that I could find, it was not what I wanted. It was a general puppy care book with Havanese pictures. Important issues related to the health and care of Havanese were not mentioned or addressed. Don't waste your money unless you are just paying for the pictures. Buy a more inclusive puppy care book if this is what you're looking for."
2,"A generic book, not specific to the Havanese breed","There are two very common problems with Havanese dogs. One is in regards to problems with vision and the other is with tear staining. I have used other sources to find out about these COMMON issues with this breed. I can see that this book is a generic book, where the author fills in the blank, with the word Havanese. It is not specific enough to the breed. I would look into other books. If they don't mention CERF testing and tear staining, which are COMMON problems, don't buy the book."
2,Havanese - A complete and Reliable Handbook - Goodale,"I also have to agree with a couple of previous reviews about the health issues. Some of the sections could pertain to any breed - the photos lead you to believe it was written specificially about the Havanese. There is no deep insight as to the Havanese issues; so I was disappointed since I had read that Goodale was responsible for getting things really started for this breed in the US, being a responsible breeder and for starting up the Havanese Club of America. I enjoyed her portrayal of the history and the legend of the lady, Catalina Lasa. I prefer the Guerra book much better."
5,cracked bottle,Love this stuff! Glad to find it as an 'ad on' product for amazon. The bottle was cracked when I took it out of the package. Not really a big deal.
3,No MSG!,"Weird review from Dempsey for a product that is mostly salt but contains no MSG at all!An expensive way to get a mixture of salt, garlic powder with a tiny bit of oregano and pepper, but it's easy enough to check the ingredients"
5,tamagotchi marachi,"I really love these little things. You can take them anywhere ad they are really fun. Every time that I go to the store they are sold out so that must mean that they are a hit. Tamagotchis teach children that if you want a pet than you need to feed it, love it, and make it happy. This toy is educational and fun."
5,I AM A TAMAGOTCHI FREAK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Well, I just got this exact tama today, and I love it already!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have an adorable little baby girl and its name is Halie. I LOVE IT TO DEATH!!!! I have already played like a million games and bought TONS of stuff, but unfortunitely, the tama can't use any of the stuff until it is an adult. It can only play with the ball. But I love playing the two games, Jump and Bump and earning the Gotchi points.(it will earn Heading and Slot when it is a teenager and adult)I even connected with my sister and we gave each other presents(poop, snakes, balls, cake, and other cool stuff) and played games against each other. Our tamas have become ""friends"" but we are going to keep connecting. My sister has a boy, so we want them to get married and have tama-babies. Ooops!!! Halie just pooped. Gotta go. 'Bye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,BEST HOLIDAY GIFT EVER!,I GOT THIS TOY FOR CHRISTMAS AND i CAN'T STOP PLAYING WITH IT!A TAMAGOTCHI IS LIKE TAKING CARE OF A REAL CHILD. IT DOES MOSTLY EVERYTHING A KID DOES LIKE:EAT FOODSLEEPPLAY GAMESSHOPCONNECT AND PLAY W/ FRIENDSPOOP(GROSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!)GIVE PRESENTS TO FRIENDSIF AAN ADULT IS READING THIS AND IS LOOKING FOR A SURPRISE GIFT OR A KID IS READING THIS FOR FUN I RECOMEND BOTH TO GET IT AND TRY IT OUT!
5,I NEED INFORMATION FROM ALL YOU PEOPLE WHO HAVE TAMAGOTCHI'S,"Hi i am 11 and i need some information on tamagotchi i dont have one yet but i am saving up my money for one. and i need help,first of all i want to know how to operate it and i also want to know what you do with it. please e-mail me at flower_princess11@hotmail.com please e-mail me.thank you"
5,The Family Man--And Woman,"Jerry MacGregor and wife Patti have delivered not only a first class book, but three children as well! This literary dynamic duo breaks the mold on ""family time."" If you think family life is boring, think again, and nab a copy of Family Times. You'll be catapulted into the stratosphere with fresh, fun ways to get all the goody out of the fleeting years with your children."
5,Cold Mountain,"I love this CD! I have been listening to it non-stop for the past week. I have recommended to all of my friends and family. The movie was wonderful and the soundtrack made it even more so. Super, super, super!!"
4,Cold Mountain soundtrack,"I love this soundtrack. Cold Mountain is one of my all-time favorite movies. I noticed that one song in particular didn't have the words along with the music, like it does in the movie. But I love it anyway."
5,Cold Mt Soundtrack,"Excellent music, if you liked the movie you'll love the soundtrack. Read the book its excellent."
2,JUST SCRATCHES THE SURFACE OF OLD TIME MUSIC,"Kudos to the review by d-adenan from Alexandria, Va. This soundtrack is a Hollywoodized version of 19th century music. C'mon, Jack White singing Wayfaring Stranger? For those who really get inspired by this music, who want more, try the disc ""Songs from the mountain"" for sale right here on this site - that'll give a more satisfying taste for the tunes played in a more authentic style - great vocals by Tim O'Brien with fiddle, banjo, and guitar accompaniment. For those who care to know, there is a movement in this country of folk who play this music regularly, who gather in homes and at contra dances to play this style of music - check out various ""old time"" websites for the music festivals, workshops, recordings, and dances. And yes, the best stuff is by the Sacred Harp Singers."
2,Dull and somewhat offensive,"Having been born a first generation Yankee with Southern roots, I of course was raised listening to the music of Bill Monroe and Earl and Scruggs. But this is NOT bluegrass, nor even the more popular ""Roots"" music. Aside from the always great Allison Krauss and one or two other exceptions, the caterwauling on this album is offensive, the equivalent of a White man's minstrel show. I find the ""musicianship"" of some of the ""artists"" a rude ""homage"" to true American Appalachian music; they sound like caricaturists from a 1930's vaudeville act hamming it up as to what this type of music ""should"" sound like. Don't waste your time, I can't even get past the fourth or fifth track. Utterly offensive for someone raised on this type of stuff."
2,Where is Sting?!,"This albumn could have been much much better. I was expecting an 'O Brother Where Art Thou' type of soundtrack and was purely dissapointed. It just didnt have the same feel as the music didnt sound 'old timey' egnough.My Second bigger dissapointment is NO STING!!!!!!! Sting wrote both the music and the lyrics for the song 'My Ain True Love' and will perform it for the Golden Globes but he is not on the albumn. In my opinion this is a travisty! When are people going to learn that no one should cover Sting's songs. EVER!The third dissapointment is Gabriel Yareds score Tracks are way too short. I almost wish they werent on the albumn at all, as this albumn does not give a great score justice.All in all I would pass on this disc. Or at the very least try to pick it up used if you must have it."
4,what you would hope for,"If you saw the movie Cold Mountain and you enjoyed the music that you heard, then you will not be disappointed by this album. It is a wonderful, consistent collection of roots music. If you like this music then I recommend you check out March 16 - 20 1992 by Uncle Tupelo, Ain't No Grave by various artists, and Fantastic Expedition by Dillard And Clark."
3,pretty darned good,"while it's not as good as the soundtrack to o brother where art thou, it tries hard and comes pretty close. T bone burnett is a great producer and I would recommend the CD to people interested in that type of music"
2,"Great Movie, OK album","Will someone please give Jack White some talent? And where's the recognition of Alan Lomax in first recording the Sacred Heart singers, from which songs from this cd come?"
3,Great Classic Eighties German Hardcore Punk,"These guys were great. I got into these guys in the late eighties around the same time I was getting into hardcore bands outside of the U.S. and Canada. Just like Raw Power from Italy these guys deliver and won't dissapoint. They played songs at multiple tempos that range from raw hardcore to street punk. This CD is a collection of live recordings from multiple shows in the eighties. Although the quality is lacking at times the documentaion values are there. They rip through several songs with a great punk rock ferociousness long gone dead in the new decade of ""buy me this mommy"" generation MTV fake punk. I rate this CD as a worthy of your hard earned dosh if you are into raw fast and loud hardcore with street punk sensibilities."
3,A Hokey Look at Spirituality,"While I chose to view this film on the spiritual context, the poor acting and writing made it feel hokey at best. I liked the idea of a struggling actor (insert any profession or life journey filled with self-doubt) discovering for himself the spiritual realm, a facing of fears, and glimpses of past lives. However, too much of it felt like a poorly done fantasy/sic-fi movie. The ending was the worst part of sitting through the entire movie. Throughout the movie, Finn was learning about how to become his true self, how to overcome past transgressions, forgive others, himself, and most of all, what his purpose is on this earth. With that said, the ending did not make any sense."
4,"Good, but beware if you are a teacher","I bought this video to show an 8th grade class. However, the artist swears a couple times and there are numerous depictions of artistic nudity. Be warned if you are a teacher and don't want students running home to tell their parents what they saw in school. It would probably be ok in high school, but no younger. It is pretty interesting, but does get dry and slow at times."
5,Everyone should know him,I bought this VHS as a gift - everybody should know this remarkable artist - who once was an excellent realistic style artist and then challenged beyond any conceivable limits for an artist - yet he worked with the remaining abilites he had and SURPASSED his pre- disability results. You have to know this story and remember it when next you feel any limitation in your life.
2,Time for change is right.,"I am thinking that Texino has had enough good times with Patterson family. Maybe Canadian peoples are really that happy and white, but since Mrs. Johnston sells the majority of her wares in USA, I think the stories should be more in line with the happenings in this lovely land. In real life: Deana could be addicted to pills, her baby could die from SIDS. Without free medical care the goofy husband could die of heart attack or better yet, kill himself like many a dentist does. Elly could become a bag lady drunk and the rest could just drift off for the worse. If Texino was writing comics, this would definately be the fact of the matter.Go USA #1."
4,Welcome to the Holy Game of Poker,"This movie is such an enjoyable thing to watch. Every actor in it gives some of the best work ever done. Matt Damon shows that he can not only write but truly act. He portrays a man who is addicted to the game of poker, but because of his girl-friend and life, has given it up. Not until an old friend gets out of prison, Edward Norton, does he get sucked back into the old world that he had forgotten. The movie is dark and gritty, offering the idea of what these people's lives were really about. I, myself am not a real poker player, but this movie really made me want to get out a deck of cards and call a few friends. Definately worth a watch."
5,All-round good reading...,"This book delivers exactly what it promises, ""...biblical exposition, wise counsel, practical sanity and warm exhortation."" And while reading full-length sermons may seem dull to some, let those skeptics go to work on this collection. Charles Spurgeon brings such a passion to the words that one doesn't merely read them, but listens to Spurgeon shout them from behind a pulpit and is brought into a comfortable family of believers (being his Pastor's College). It's a must-read for the mature Christian (especially if he is being called into the ministry)."
2,For beginners only...,"Not what I had expected -- VERY brief histories on all environmental acts, but no references to where to find regulations, rules etc. Very short section to EAs and EISs. Only valuable to those with absolutely no environmental experience."
4,Lowered trade barriers,"Before the World Trade Organisation took its name, there was for decades the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The Tokyo Round refers to a series of GATT negotiations from 1973 to 1979. Winham offers a historical perspective on it, comparing it to other major trade treaties of the 20th century. But he also places it in the context of the international economics of the 1980s.He shows how governments (especially the US and Japanese) were able to largely fight off important domestic pressure groups, and liberalise [reduce] trade barriers, for a greater overall good. Impressive commitments that were often underappreciated by the general public."
3,Repo Jake,"The product was as described I would purchase from the buyer again . Although the content of this video was unique to say the least . Too bad Dan Haggerty has the talent , but not the budget of good Producers or editers behind him ."
1,wrong item pictured,"The product pictured is not the product being sold. Bowling Alley wax is the clear paste wax from Butcher's. In the item listing, notice the ""AMB"" this indicates the Amber paste wax from Butcher's which has an amber tint to it. I ordered this product without noticing that the item listing and the picture did not match, and when I contacted the seller, they offered to send me a call tag to ship it back to them for a credit on my account, but tried to tell me the two products were the same, and when I disagreed, they admitted they didn't actually have the product pictured in stock and would not be able to send the products I ordered. Buyer beware."
5,Great Little Interface,"This is the little midi interface that could! I only have a qualm with the plastic packaging, it's like almost all small electronics right now, you can't get into it without a machete.....The Edirol, when connected to my G5 running Leopard, was plug and play. Absolutely NO problems. It's small and works like a dream!If you're looking for a compact, low price USB/Midi interface, this is the one for you!!!"
1,Dead on Aririval,"I should have known better. Murphy was at work. It was just over a year after I received my Edirol UM-3ex that I finally had the time to take it out of its packaging and try it out. It didn't work. No signs of life at all. I tried it with four different computers, four different drivers, four different operating systems and got no response at all. The warranty is 3 mo/ 1 year. I'll have to see if I bought it on a credit card with extended protection. The moral to the story is do every thing you can to try out a piece of gear right after you receive it, even if you don't have time to really get into it. This model is discontinued now. It's getting harder and harder to find a good mid-level midi interface. The 1-in-1-out midi interfaces are a dime a dozen, and the high end jobs are also available. Its in this multiple-in&out/under$100 level that the products are hard to find. It's a shame this one didn't work."
3,"Great stories, if incomplete","Of course the short stories here are excellent, but it is terrible that the origional Part Four of The Bear has been removed. Anyone who enjoys The Bear owes it to themselves to find a complete copy (it will have five parts) because Part Four is arguably the most important and meaningful portion of the entire story!"
4,A great book for summer,"It's not highbrow, but it is fun. I read it on an airplane and then ignored my family once I got home so I could learn how things ended. Josie is funny--she's not a comic--but she is funny in the way most of us would be if others could hear what goes on inside our heads. Because not much is written from the point of view of young, well-educated, modern women, I particularly appreciated this book. I look forward to Ms. Preston's next book."
3,"Fun, but never quite what you expected...","I'll have to admit that I was a bit disappointed in Jackie by Josie. I'd heard great things and picked it up in a Back Bay bookstore. While Preston's style is breezy and distracting, I hoped the Jackie-Josie parallels would be stronger and more funny. It's overstating it to call Preston a humorist...her story is mildly amusing. Many of the characters are certainly compelling, but Josie is not one of them. The writing is accomplished and I'll be looking for Preston's next effort, but this wasn't a favorite of mine."
4,"well-written in a breezy, charismatic way","I got on a train and couldn't put JACKIE BY JOSIE down. The wonderful book cover first drew me to the book and the description hauled me in. That I was travelling from Boston made me feel like a character in the story watching from the sidelines. This is because the writer writes in a breezy, fun, engaging way. When a mystery, drama or anything with long, awkward description WON'T do and you just want to get lost in a story, this book is enchanting and the one to reach for!"
4,A delightful novel... written with charm and sensitivity.,"Research for one more mining of Jackie O. material provides a framework for a sweet and intelligent love story about two likeable graduate students. Josie returns home with her small son, Henry, to Massachusetts to live with her mother while she is doing research at the Kennedy Library. Peter, her husband, heads out to Berkeley to take up his new teaching job, sharing his drive across country and later his Berkeley digs with Monica, a fellow Brown American studies student with Peter and Josie. Exploration into the Kennedy myths develop parallels in the lives of Josie and her family. The author, wife of Christopher Tilghman whose Mason's Retreat was one of last year's winners, has written an entertaining and engaging first novel"
2,I can't finish it,"The story is ok. The writing style is too weird.I'm sorry, I cannot get into a book that reads like this (not a quote): ""Josie is sitting in bed. Josie grabs a tissue and blows her nose. Josie thinks about things. She gets up and calls her friend.""Everything is in present, -happening now- tense, as if someone is narrating a TV show to you. The only part of the book I enjoyed (up to chapter 6 when I stopped reading) was the flashbacks. That's when the writer wrote ""normal.""I really tried to give this book a chance, since I was annoyed by this style within the first page, but I made it through 100! :)"
2,I can't finish it either,"I thought there was something wrong with me. I heard great things about this, and I was overwhelemed by the snippets of reviews in the book. But the writing really isn't good enough...and I just wasn't that interested in Josie's history nor that of her extremely boring, selfish, annoying husband. Not to mention her boring mother. Sorry, I've just had a spate of reading people like Ian McEwan who can really write...a much better command of the language. I see Elinor Lipman is her mentor...another one that's good but not as great as they say. Interesting that one reviewer says that if you like Le Divorce you'll like this...hmmm....couldn't finish that one either."
3,Slow but very steady,"I like to read books by female authors & found this book by checking into Amazon's recommendations & suggestions. Liked the subject matter: doing research on a trash novel on Jackie O. I have a 3 year old son & could relate to a lot of the descriptions of her dealings: goldfish snacks in the car, etc. Interesting relationships throughout the story. I put it down for a while & picked it up again. Glad I finished it. Nice ending."
4,"If you loved Le Divorce, you will like Jakie by Josie","This was a well written and engaging story. It was not has humorous as I had hoped but I did have a few laugh out loud moments. Preston did write an original story and I loved reading about the whole ""grad school"" lifestyle and could not put the book down. Enjoy!"
3,GOOD BUT DESAPPOINTING,"I AM A FAN OF THE COLONIAL PAINTING IT IS GOOD BOOK WITH VERY GOOD ILLUSTRATIONS. BUT IT WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED TO FIND JUST A FEW PAINTINGS OF ANGELS AND ARCHANGELS. THE TITLE OF THE BOOK IS THE VIRGIN, SAINTS AND ANGELS SO I WAS EXPECTING SEVERAL AND GOOD ANGELS PAINTINGS AND THERE WERE JUST A FEW."
5,Great Potty,"The potty came in a giant box that said ""Adult Assembly Required"". It's not really assembly because you're just unscrewing and then screwing back on some screws.So far the potty chair is a big hit with my 22 month old and it looks like it's sturdy enough to last until my 4 month old is ready for it, too. It's light-weight enough to move around without a problem (from one bathroom to another), but has survived the toddler pushing it over.Great potty. Was a little over-priced, but it's just so much better than those tiny plastic catastrophes that they sell at Walmart or Babies'R'Us."
4,Small but Powerful,"This is a short little book, but has a powerful message. Children need to experience our environment first hand in order to appreciate it. Once they learn to appreciate it, they will want to preserve it. Plus kids do not get enough outdoor time these days. It also provides excellent reference of books for all aged children on the environment. A must read for teachers and anyone who has an impact on our youth and environment, which should be everyone."
5,Recieved in time,Child hood favorite Many stare in the movie I enjoyed growing up. It also telles a little of the life of Brothers Grimm
2,A DVD in proper format is desperately needed,"I saw this in the current pan & scan (or as is euphemistically appropriate now, full screen) a few years back and found it to be a painful experience. Adding insult to injury was the condition of the print; faded, washed out, and subject to the ravages that plague single strip colour prints of this era. The movie itself is entertaining enough, but what I'd really like to see is a DVD done in anamorphic widescreen in the Smilebox letterboxing process. This would preserve the original look of the Cinerama process and reduce the amount of distortion normally associated with those tiny lenses Cinerama used. MGM's been doing well with its rereleases on DVD; here's hoping this one will get on the list at some point."
5,"Hurry up DVD, I' m getting older as I type","This has always been a personal favourite of mine, from the old CINERAMA days. When will this film get a decent quality transfer release(Tape & laser-disc were hopeless )I feel that if it's not done right the next time, it won't get another go. Also the inclusion of the missing ""ABOVE THE STARS"" sequence, that has never been seen at all, would be a definite bonus, the theme is there but not the segment, and there must be enough material to do some sort of documentary.I will not purchase this title again until enough of these points are rectified."
2,the armored dinosaurs,"I'm dissapointed in the book ,after years of reading dinosaur books it's not fun to read,It's like reading a medical gernal"
5,"well written,fascinating insights",Lots of new info and great insight on HIH Grand Duchess Xenia.As someone at the centre of the romanov family her observations are especially salient.A must read for devotees of the Russian imperial family.
4,Good for Romanov collectors,"This is a good is somewhat ploddy read. Most Romanov books focus on Nicholas II and family, so it's refreshing to read about another family member. Very scholarly book with several pictures."
1,"Too big if recessed, too flat if not","I got this hoping to adapt my Samsung 245T to a Ergotron arm. Unfortunately, the plate is just too big for the recessed area on the back of the monitor.Also, this is a flat plate. If using a monitor with no recessed area, then there is not sufficient clearence for the screws. A flat plate is always a bad design for a 100x100 to 100x200 VESA mount adapter. A proper adapter is raised, to provide clearence for the inner set of screws."
4,Unique Opportunity,This is a unique opportunity to learn about the trials faced and joys experienced by business professionals entering into another country to build a theme park. The book describes the journey that Larry and Lorna took from monsoons to tea houses and from surfing to theme park rides. I enjoyed learning about the customs and found myself wondering if I could have weathered the adventure as well as they did.The book is an easy read and well worth your time to explore these 31 months in Japan while building a theme park.
1,"Chunky, clunky, and poor sound","The earphones seemed decent enough when they first came out of the package. However upon closer inspection, I realized (too late) that you can't separate the earphones from the auto-winder device. So if you want to walk around with these, expect to have a rather large plastic lump hanging from the wires.The sound is decent however the treble output is poor. I'm a treble person and I found the bass way too strong. On the other hand, if you like bass this might be a good thing. They don't even have lables on the earphones to indicate which is the left and right bud. All in all, I say you're probably better off buying ANY other earphones."
2,"Clunky, cumbersome, and useless.","Unfortunately, these earphones were not at all what I hoped for. The sound quality was very tinny and had a very hollow sound. I also did not like how there was a volume control on the case because it seemed to contribute to the degraded sound quality. In addition, the wires are oddly placed and it is very cumbersome to have to carry around such a large case all the time. The earbuds themselves hurt my ears because the rubber rings were too large and it felt like the metal speaker-covering was ready to fall off five minutes after opening the package. I suggest you stay away from these and stick with a nice pair of Sony earbuds or the Jensen earmuff headphones."
1,Absolutely terrible.,Terrible. Picture is misleading. The casing structure is actually attached to the entire unit and they expect you to carry it around with your headphones.
2,This thing sucks,"Don't buy this! First the autowinder dose not work at all--I had to leave the wire under the cap; Second, the wires do not work--I could only hear sound from one ear, sometimes none; And third, the earphones are huge--they hurt my ears so much, I could not wear it for more than ten minutes.I give it two star only because when I first bought it, it worked well, and porvided pleasureable sound. But then, everything down hill. Bad quality!I will have to throw it away, buy a real headphone!!"
3,The speakers hurt myy ears but okay sound quality,The speakers hurt myy ears but okay sound quality the auto wind feature was nice but not very compact
4,Excellent book about an important individual,"Very good book about one of the most important figures in modern conservation. Marshall was one of the co-founders of the wilderness society and was instrumental in helping create the national wilderness preservation system. He also helped with places such as the Adirondacks and the immense Gates of the Arctic National Park in Alaska. This book provides an interesting summary of this man's extraordinary life, including his famous 40 and 50 mile day hikes!"
4,A Wilderness Original,"Interesting biography of environmental activist Bob Marshall. Marshall was not exactly the typical eco-warrior type. He came from a wealthy Jewish family, he was highly educated, never married, described by everybody that knew him as a likeable but very odd man. He was a fanatical hiker and wilderness explorer who thought nothing of hiking 30 plus miles a day. He died at a very young age, which most think was due to him pushing his physical limits too far. He did a lot of good during his life so I can't really fault the guy. Infact he was quite admirable."
4,Review of a new world not defined or developed,So little research has been to interpet and thus help guide men trough a (traumatic?) age in their life. The change of life for a man outside of the traumatic poblems stringht face are maginified by the lack of understanding a gay may gets. We dont even understand the roll of friends who are are often lovers problems. To achieve true marital bliss should we embrace the possible solutions or emphazise what is most epepe
4,I love Gerber,I bought this item to replace my ten year old Gerber. The only issue with that tool was that a friend borrowed it and broke the small flat blade screwdriver using it as a pry bar. This new unit has exceeded my expectations so far.
1,stick w/ the babies,I loved Babywise and swear by that book. This book didn't tell me anything that I didn't already know
5,A MUST READ for anyone interested in wolfdogs!,"Weather you already share your life with a wolfdog, are considering one, or just interested in learning more, this is THE ONE book you cannot be without! Living with Wolfdogs is considered to be the wolfdog owner's bible, and rightly so. Nicole Wilde's years of experience working with wolfdogs abounds from cover to cover in this concise, straightforward book aimed at every aspect of wolfdog care. Nicole manages to pour volumes of insight, knowledge and advice into the pages of this outstanding little book that no one who loves wolfdogs should be without."
5,A must for anyone considering a wolfdog or who has one,"This book is a must for anyone who is considering a wolfdog or for especially a new owner. Its packed full of tips, hints, great pictures and essential information. The author has a sense of humor, which you must have to own one of these animals. A step by step guide I won't be without."
5,A must read!,This is an excellent book. A must read for anyone who shares their life or is considering sharing their lives with a wolfdog. A practical easy to follow guide to overcomming common behavior issues concerning wolfdogs. This book is informative and her writing style is direct and to the point so you don't fall asleep. I can't praise this book enough! May I also recommend her book Wolfdogs A-Z an excellent companion book with a bit more detail.
3,past wolfdog owner,"Enjoyable, but could have contained more information and perhaps stories from wolfdog owners. A ""realtiy check"" for dreamers without knowledge of what is involved in caring for this type of animal."
3,welllllll......,"I ordered it, read it, and kinda disappointed with it... The book is supposed to pertain wolf dogs and it more or less teaches you to train any breed of dog, where some info was relevant to wolf dogs this book mostly is about training a dog..... whatever you breed you own this book is great, I would look elsewhere if you want something specifically pertaining to your wolfdog."
2,Not the best book on the subject,Very brief book and not the best on the subject. No negatives about wolfdogs listed.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Opt for a Coleman.,"I bought two of these airbeds, and both were somewhat deflated after a night of use. It turns out that BOTH had holes in them. Apparently other people online have had the same experience. Will never buy this Target trash again."
3,Great Book Until Date # 55,"Captivating story of a soul mate searcher... The writer is a role model in many senses for women in their 30s who still look for their soul mate.... Jennifer Cox is there, with her past mistakes and current determination in taking control of her destiny... She is courageous in making fun of herself, she is full of humor in dealing with the world in large... The book is entertaining as the story itself.... But only until date # 55... This is when Jennifer Cox meets her soul mate and the rest of the journey and thus the book itself become nothing more than an obligation to be fullfilled... Detachment and selfishness dominate the rest of the story due to natural reaction of one when faced with love but that doesn't sound that natural when it comes to the book itself..."
2,Boring,"I expected more from the story, it was interesting because of what the author does but in the end the story was a bit boring. It lacks pace."
4,a good read,"This book is interesting and keeps your attention the whole way through! At first I was kind of irritated at the author for not giving Olivier, the cute French guy a chance. But then towards the end of the book she starts to realize she has to let things flow and not try to control them. She seems to feel more at home in America than in Europe and starts to unwind a bit and then she falls in love! She planned her dates with no down-time at the beginning and therefore was grumpy all the time! It makes you realize how important it is to always have time for yourself alone otherwise you can't enjoy things no matter how nice they are. Better to travel to one spot and stay a while than to always be on the move and tired.Great book!"
4,TOUGH CRITIC,"I really enjoyed this book, I love dating books, especially the one of true accounts, in diary form, and traveling out side the U.S. in search of love. This book was fast moving most of the story, but I take my hat off to anyone who is willing to follow even chase after their dreams no matter how far it takes them, it's very inspirational. The other books that I found very much alike were ... ""The Bridget Jones Diary"" and ""The Dream Begins When I Awake."""
3,Please finish this book,"I have never felt compelled to write a review but I read this book in May 2005 and still wake up in the middle of the night with questions for Ms. Cox (it is now Christmas). The book began with such promise, I laughed out loud many times, but then it was as if she totally lost interest. Please publish a 'Final Part' to what looked to be one of the greatest stories ever told."
2,Cute Pop-ups...not much else,"I got the book mostly for the pop-ups. They are really nice, just wish there was more. As for the facts in the book, so far I have found one fact to be not true. Makes me wonder how many others are incorrect. This book is good for kids and not many other people."
5,Excellent book,"I bought this book as somewhat of a coffee table book, but was amazed at the illustrations and the quality of the pop up. I would highly recommend it to anyone!!"
5,"Great pop-up to ""transport"" you back to W.D.W.",I love this book. The EPCOT page just blows my mind. The engineering that went into designing that sort of pop-up is mind boggling.The only thing I wish this book had is Disney music and more pages!
3,Buy Oracle Web Application Server Handbook instead,"Does a reasonable job of covering Oracle Web Application Server 3.0, but the Oracle Press book is better."
2,Ok introductory book but look elsewhere for in depth info.,"As an introductory book its fine but as a `Most Complete' you want it to expand beyond basic examples into e.g. interaction between the cartridge types, practical implementation advice etc.I'd have used the money back guarantee if there was one as I expected a bit more from it."
3,Not bad book for beginning,The text provides more of a basic over view of Ows 3.0 and it's capabilites. It dosen't fully in my opinion get to the meat of the server. it's strength's and weakness.
3,No CD!,"They might brag about a CD in the pre-release marketing, but they apparently changed their minds. So don't expect a CD - there isn't one!"
1,It may be cheap now....wait till it breaks down,"I was given the player for Christmas. The first one did not work and I returned it for another. It worked for 5 months and then started freezing either 10 minutes or a hour into a movie. The warranty is only 90 days and then they charge $100 to fix it. Plus, the Audiovox customer service people were totally rude and unhelpful. They would not even listen, they just kept telling me to send them money. When I went to try to return it at the store the honest saleman did tell me that this was the DVD player most returned. DO NOT BUY AUDIOVOX"
1,"Would rate it a ""0""!","WILL NEED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY IF YOU BUY THIS PRODUCT! Worked fine on our first trip - next use was outside of the 90 day warranty and it started freezing up about 30 minutes into a movie. It's next little trick was saying ""wrong disc"" or ""no disc"" with any and all DVDs or CDs I placed in it. So I have spent $200 for a trip worth of watching movies. NOT A GOOD DEAL! If anyone wants to buy it for the battery - I'm selling :-)"
4,Great...especially for the price!,"I got this mainly for my 4-year-old, so that long trips and boring meetings might become a little more endurable for her. It's great! She loves it, and I think it's simple enough she'll be able to operate it as she gets just a little bigger. Yeah, the speakers aren't much, in that they're a bit tinny. And, there are a lot of buttons on the top of the machine that little fingers like to press--but, at the same time, this makes it so much more convenient, because you don't have to constantly keep track of that little remote (which DOES work really well!). It gets a bit warm on the bottom after it's played for a bit, but it wasn't excessive. The picture quality seems to be good from any angle. I'm very pleased with it so far!"
2,"I found the Skipper, Where's Gilligan?","This thing has skipped on every single dvd we've tried to play in it. Not just a skip here and there, but lots of skips, lags, frozen screens, even the cc gets all messed up. It makes this crazy clicking sound when it's messing up, too. Not through the whole movie, but like I said before, EVERY movie-even Dora, which is only 25 mins long and brand spankin' new...not one has played all the way through.It is usually sitting on my nightstand not being moved or touched, too. I'm not running around doing hurdles in the backyard, making it skip...I'm gonna swap it for another one and give it the benefit of the doubt...maybe I got a bad egg.I'll update afterwards."
3,watch for the frozen screens...,"I was given the audiovox as a gift and it is an impressive looking little unit. It's really slim in size, and the screen size really is sufficient for getting the effects of any movie from Open Range with Kevin Costner to Matrix Revolution. The volume is not very loud, although it is fine if there is no other peripheral sound. However, stick a pair of earphones on, and it's great. But after several movies, I also began to experience frozen screens, black screens, and the select scenes icon would not activate. However, it doesn't happen on every film, and movies can be watched to the end, and enjoyed for the most part. The bottom also gets quite hot during viewing. As I received it as a gift, I certainly can't complain about the price, but I might recommend looking at other portable player reviews, and seeing if they highlight similar problems before buying."
4,So far so good,"I have it for a week now, and tested it on >10 SVCD discs, 1 DVD (as I don't own many DVDs), 6 VCD discs, and JPEGs. No problem on any of the discs, except on 3 SVCD it froze for few seconds, then it moved on w/o problem. The quality display on moves are good, lack in JPEGs, but no big deal as we buy it for movie viewing. Tested it on really bumpy roads, no skipping at all. It gets quite warm, specially in the bottom, after ~1/2 hr viewing; it doesn't get any hotter so I guess it's okay. The speaker sound is just so-so, the volume is not very loud even at its loudest setting, but still audible in the car. It sounds much better/louder with headphones."
1,NO MORE AUDIOVOX,"tHE FIRST ONE I BOUGHT WOULD NOT WORK RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX AND I TOKK IT BACK TO THE STORE FOR AN IMMEDIATE EXCHANGE BECAUSE IT DID NOT READ ANY DISC, DVD OR CD. THE SECOND ONE PLAYED FOR ABOUT A MONTH AND I ALSO TOOK THAT ONE BACK, THE THIRD ONE WOULD NOT POWER UP, aUDIOVOX IS GARBAGE ANDI WOULD RECCOMEND SPENDING MORE AND GETTING A PANASONIC."
1,Not user friendly,"When I received this DVD player, I was surprised to find that the battery case is a separate piece from the player itself. However, I plugged it in and charged it up. On my first airplane trip after receiving it, I foolishly packed the battery piece in my luggage and the player itself in my carryon bag. Sure enough, you can't use the player without the separate battery charger! After recharging and further investigation, I found a strange little switch on the side of the player that has to be in one position or the other for the screen to display your DVD. Also, I found the on/off switch to be less than obvious. If I had it to do over, I would follow the other reviewer's advice and get a Sony."
2,NOT An Update of 20 Hot Potatoes,"I had used the book 20 Hot Potatoes Christians Are Afraid to Touch as a resource for teaching a Sunday School class years ago, and found it to be provocative, discussion starting, and yet grounded in the Biblical tradition of which Tony Campolo is a part (American Baptist). I thought this book might be an update of that book, and ordered it for use in teaching a class. I find it to be difficult for the participants in the class to understand. The chapters are longer than the earlier work, and the discussions are less thought-provoking.For a reader interested in the sociology of religion or theology and its relation to current controversial topics, this is a good book. For the general reader, I'm not sure it's the best of its genre."
4,Thank God for Gray,"Essentially, this book boils down to this: the further off in the weeds we get, the less likely we are to have a monopoly on the truth. Tony's assertion of evangelicalism boils down to the Apostle's Creed and the authority of scripture. We're in C.S. Lewis-land at this point. The fights begin once we start getting into how those essential beliefs (the 'mere' in 'Mere Christianity') inform our action: our social and political world views.Tony gives us a glimpse into the formations of many of his world view lenses. It's a fascinating process - one that many of his self-righteous critics have probably never bothered with. Why, when some bumper sticker at the Christian Gift Center will tell you all you need to know? Tony knows enough to know that he doesn't know it all, and I'm thankful for that. Plus, he's not waiting until he's got it all figured out to make a difference: shaking things up and getting us out of navel-gazing ways.Preach it, Tony. This seeker is glad for your voice."
5,Auto Ventshade 21022 Hoodflector Smoke Low Profile Hood Shield,Smoke color and style enhance the front hood of the car. Looks great! Have used the same product on my two Tahoe's and previous Yukon XL.
1,Kensington wireless mouse,"This wireless mouse is horrible. It stopped working after a couple months, probably due to the fact that the reciever couldn't find the signal from the mouse. Have tried using advice from Kensington's support page, but nothing has worked."
4,Great affordable mouse,"I have had this wireless mouse a few years now. I tried it after having problems with the Microsoft Blue mouse, which was horrible. All in all, it works great, and is well designed. My only gripe would be that this particular model does not have a switch to cut it off, because it does seem to need the batteries replaced pretty often. I still highly recommend this mouse."
5,Maxell -- always the best,"These discs are great. They work well with the Sharp 722 I recently bought. I have been buying Maxell products since the early 70s when I bought reel-to-reel tape in 7"" reels. Always had good results sonically with Maxell. In fact I have tapes recorded 30 years ago that still sound decent. There are cheaper discs out there, but I would avoid especially the Memorex discs. Even though they had a great ad campaign with ""is it live or is it Memorex"" I have never been fully satisfied with their cassettes or CD-R discs. Stick with the Maxell and get the full specs and enjoyment you wanted when you got your minidisc."
5,GO 4 MAXELL,"Great product,fine top quality! I've been using MD for about 5 years now and 90% are Maxell MD's.They come in varied colors,good to organize collections or categories.Cool slide case too!Definetly the best portable recording/playback digital media.Sound performance is best(cd like) when recorded with optical cable.You won't miss your tapes!"
4,Okay deal - if you consider the storage case.,Tried to erase and record all over again - works well. The fidelity with respect to the original is not as good as the other MD's that I have. Also the outer case does not appear to be durable! The stickers that come alongwith the package is pathetic. Overall the product is Ok - with the MD storage case as the saving grace.
2,Not worth the money,This book is too simplistic. There are no new ideas or concepts in it. Everything in this book you've seen somewhere else. Not worth the money.
4,Cook Up Some Family Fun,"This is such a great idea! This book uses popular children's literature and provides an activity and a recipe to go along with the story. The activites are interesting and easy to do (i.e. they usually require objects or ingredients that one has around the house) and the recipies are really quite tasty. What a great way to enhance the reading experience of a favorite book. This books is great family fun. One small note, I would have liked to see suggested age levels for each title since I am not familiar with every book included in this activity guide."
1,The thin end of a giant wedge ......................,"It was 1965, and two sociologists found themselves at the forefront of a brand new industry - the business book. They had discovered a huge potential audience of clueless managers and leaders. Strategy : appear to be an expert by transforming something simple for good managers into something complicated enough to be justified charging lesser managers for guidance, which enlightens no-one but makes you richer (and a guru to boot!).Since these guys were probably instrumental in giving us Tom Peters and the like, they have a lot of explaining to do."
3,Nice product,"At first I was getting alot of static on this phone, but once I found an outlet where it didn't have intereference from other electrical items, it was fine. Its clear and has nice features."
1,Terrible,"The voice quality was awful. It sounded like I was talking on a two-way radio. Those on the other end of the line reported a similar lack of quality. Honestly, I've never experienced a phone this bad."
4,A fascinating precursor to Edward Tufte's work,"If you are interested in making scientific plots, or any kinds of statistical graphics for a wide audience, Edward Tufte's series and especially hisThe Visual Display of Quantitative Information, are indispensable. Reading William S. Cleveland's The Elements of Graphing Data, you can see where Tufte drew much of his inspiration, and where he expanded, clarified, and improved upon Cleveland's ideas. Much of this is simply due to advances in computer graphics, personal computers, and printing and display capability - it's been 27 years since Cleveland's book was published, and the WWW didn't even exist then. Cleveland certainly isn't at fault for the technical limits of displays in his day, but for the modern reader and chart-maker, Tufte's work is more instructive and is a better starting point."
2,Disappointed in Performance,"Although I wasn't pleased with the phone order process, follow-up conversations with Customer Service were good. The assembly wasn't difficult, but not entirely simple either. Took about an hour. I've had the bike (female) for three weeks. I regretfully say, I'm not pleased with the bike's performance. I had great expectations. I thought the bike was unusually slow and the auto-shift is loud and rough. Then yesterday, I participated in a community bike ride. My bike was the slowest! Even slower than the kid's. I pedaled faster, and the bike makes minimal advance. The shifting is convenient, but doesn't make up for the bike's performance. It's a shame I'm going to lose the shipping cost, because I paid that much for my old bike and I prefer it to the Landrider. Oh, and I forgot to mention, and one point, while shifting, the chain slipped off. It corrected itself, but I had to pull over."
1,aaaaaaah oh no its coming after me,"i am being attacked by my tamagotchi it sprouted legs and arms because i forgot to feed it. my name is choconibletbeans and i am fearing for my life, the tamagotchi took a knife and is chasing me down. ive taken refuge in this room so i dont die. but before i go i must warn you dont piss this thing off. or better yet dont buy the demented thing. please if theres anyone out there HELP ME! OH NO i forgot about chicichiciwawa my baby the thing is going after her. it locked me in here someone go get her. Oh by the way there is a moral to this story.... DONT PISS OFF CHILDRENS TOYS"
4,Nostalgia!,I bought this for my 15 year old daughter - a great nostaligic gift for a former Tamagotchi owner as a kid.
5,Great value!,"I bought this product from amazon after looking around at circuit city, best buy online etc. All of them carry only the monster cable product... They have no other option which is really annoying. I use a Sony receiver and have a Panasonic DVD player & this product works perfectly well with both of them. The product fits perfectly and the cable is long enough if you are using an entertainment center. Now, I am not a sound engineer but I've seen the Monster product used at stores and this product works as well as the Monster product. I would highly recommend buying this and not forking out the extra money for monster."
1,sour,"I had this product overnighted so that i would have it in time for the arrival for my new system. I run a harman kardan receiver with a denon dvd. this product does not fit tightly into the optical source of either unit. It does fit well enough to work, and sounds great. however the link simply sits in the slot and can easily fall out. i've called the manufacturer a few times and have been told that it should fit. Unfortunately i had to go and buy an entire new cable for my system. my advice is to buy something yoiu can actually see first hand, and return quite easily if it is not the proper fitting."
2,Abraham Lincoln -- Carl Sandburg,"While I understand this is entirely my fault, I am disappointed. The photo of the item shows the entire six volume set. It even says ""Abraham Lincoln, 6 Volume Set: The Sangamon Edition"". When I placed the order, there was small print that said I was only buying the last four books in the series. I thought I was getting the entire set at a good price. Read what you are getting before purchasing. The books I did get, are in great condition and I am keeping them. I still feel like it was bait and switch."
4,Great product,"By first soaking tapioca in 4 times as much room temperature water as tapioca (overnight for the large pearls and a couple hours for the small ones), then draining off the water and proceeding with your recipe you get tender tapioca in a reasonable amount of cooking time. Using a lower temperature will eliminate or minimize the problem of the pearls breaking apart. The white peals are supposed to turn translucent when fully cooked.If you want to end up with black tapioca then you have to start by buying and cooking black tapioca, it's a different product."
3,not quite what i was hoping for,"it took two+ hours to boil and even then some of the tapioca ball were still not cooked all the way through. and if your expecting the black pearls dont get your hopes up, they come out clear. if you have the time and the effort than this will work for you, i just cant see myself spending two plus hours making boba every time i happen get a craving for it."
4,Shadows on the Koyukuk,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. I was fascinated the entire time I was reading this book, and I didn't want to put it down. I have decided to read this story to my children. I hope to find the story of James Huntington called ""On the Edge of Nowhere"". A compelling story and I would recommend this story to anyone."
5,For Volvo Bus Fans!,"This book came as a nice surprise - a full color book on the history of Volvo buses. From the beginning of the 20th century to the almost-present, this book offers an interesting historical look at buses built by the famed automotive company. There's a nice array of exterior and interior shots - some of very unusual variety in service all over the world, and restored Volvo buses in various museum-like displays.Anyone who is interested in buses, or Volvo products in general, should purchase a copy of this illustrated volume."
2,don't be fooled,"these headphones sound good in print but they're not. they stopped working shortly after i bought them and i never took them out of the house! seriously, they are really funny looking when you put them on and you would not WANT to be seen in public with these on. people would point and laugh but it wouldn't last long because then the sound would go out of one ear and the other ear would be all muffled sounding. do yourself a favor and buy something else.also, don't fall for that ""self-adjusting"" noise, they don't adjust, there is just a piece of elastic [like in jogging pants but weaker] if you have big head it will work for you but otherwise it won't. it'll just sit there waiting to slide off."
4,Great regardless of price!,"This is a great set of headphones for the price. Would even pay a bit more for them. They are pretty big and are really for home use. I wouldn't take them out rollerblading. Good long cord, good sound, good volume control. Only complaint, I wish that mute button would stay down. It only stays muted when I hold it down."
2,Muffled sound,"I JUST bought these phones. I am going to return them. I have major issues with their sound. The phones DO have a nice rich bass (as other reviewers state), which I generally love, but these buggers make everything ELSE sound (like all the other instruments and voices) is singing/playing into a styrofoam cup -- very muffled and flat. It just didn't have that ""ring"" to it or crispness. I tried them on my computer and through my receiver/stereo. Only if I cranked the treble to the max and dropped the bass to pretty low did it sound ""fair"". Even my wife agreed, who always shakes her head at my audio pickiness! I'm going to look for another brand or upgrade a few dollars-worth!I *will* miss the volume control on the cord, and the ""mute"" button, though it only drops the volume substantially, rather than completely removing the sound. I won't miss looking like a weirdo in them. They bow out just above your ears. They were comfy, I will say, though I only wore them for 20 minutes."
4,Best Headphones for the money.,"These headphones are excellent quality for the money. I have purchased 50-60 dollar headphones and they do not compare with the Jensen headphones. I have taken these headphones everwhere. They have even held up on 30-40 School Sports trips. That takes a lot. The bass and excellent quality. I would recommend this product for anybody that uses a discman alot, and they handle on your hears perfect."
1,Too Good to be True,"I bought a set of these headphones in the June of this year and about a month and a half ago - the right side just stopped working. The only place I took these headphones was in my backpack during school and roadtrips. I was extremely careful with them because I bought these headphones with my own money. I had been working on them for a long time trying to get the right side to stop cutting in and out, when finally I was so fed up I hit them against my leg and they broke. Now - I'm no strong guy or anything. I'm just a wimpy teenage girl and that's saying something. And yes - I must say that I was tres embaressed to wear these headphones in public (or even around family and friends) because they make you look like an alien if you don't have a huge head. Seriously, it's pretty sad looking."
3,sounds good but.....,"When I bought this, I thought it would look real cool, but when I got it, it looked horrable.Heres whats good. Great sound if you turn up the volume on the little switchy thing and on your cd player, then the sound is LOUD. its like a mini stereothe Bad It made my ears hurt a little, but not badthe ugly The reason it looks bad is because its like a square, if you have black hair, it makes your head look 10 times bigger."
4,"Quite satisfied, unfortunate disaster","I was quite pleased with my headphones, which I purchased mid-january to use in my dorm room. They were somewhat uncomfortable with extended use (2 hours or so), but they felt pretty good, and I never had a problem with sound quality. A few days shy of the end of the year, the plastic on the un-chorded side split cleanly in two, for no apparent reason. However, for 15 bucks, AND with a lifetime(!) warranty, I still highly recommend these. I just ordered a nicer pair of sony open air ones, but these served me well."
2,"2.5 months in, busted already","what a [bad] set of headphones. ....and after about 1 month....the left headphone stopped working....and then i was too lazy to return it so i kept it for another two weeks and then the volume control switch started to malfunction...it wud shut off the other speaker when it got a lil high...and it was annoying..finally today i decided i was gonna return it...so i put it in it's packaging...and guess what...the left headphone BROKE off...like it physically detached from the uniti was EXTREMELY carefull with this pair cuz i wanted them to last for a couple years at least..but that didn't exactly happenstay clear of these headphones..they are ""TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE""it's WORTH payin an ...or w/e for a quality productsound quality was EXCELLENT tho.......while it lasted :P"
5,nice earphones,These headphones have great sound for the price and get loud without distorting. The only negative thing is that they fit loosly-you can't really esercise or things like that while wearing these.
4,too bulky... but awesome bass,The speaker adjacent to the cord gives great sound but the speaker opposite side of the cord is horrible. The head set is very bulky. Despite these inconviences this product has great sound.
2,You get what you pay for...,"I was looking for some headphones to replace my old Sony MDR-V2s that were losing their foam covering. I wanted them to limit outside noise while not leaking the sound out to outsiders either, as I need them for practicing piano without disturbing my roommates. This is why the closed-back design seemed favorable.In reading reviews of other headphones while trying to make my selection, I found that a major problem with closed-back designs is that the sound resonates and distorts, making it sound like tin cans over your ears.There is no exepction with these. When I tried playing my keyboard through them, they sounded way worse than any headphones or ear buds I had ever used with it.To their credit, keyboard voices other than piano sounded a little better, so maybe these headphones would be great for listening to techno music or something, but certainly not classical.I shall be returning these."
3,Whats Up Doc?,"This no doubt is a good movie,after all anything Tony Randall plays in is good.For he was a great actor. My question is, Why do they keep putting Mickey Roony's picture on the cover? I have Mickey's ""The Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn"" It was made between 1938- 1940.At least put Tony Randall's picture on the cover.I was fooled once when I purchased the tv movie by mistake because it had Mickeys Picture on the cover.This was sold by the Sinergy Corp. The label even pealed off and almost ruined my DVD player. So be carefull, don't go by the pictures.Read the movie information before you buy."
2,Movie Hound,"Forgt this movie, bring back the old original classic THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SWAYER, I know the racial overtones are outdated but come on, this 2006. I found an old copy, used on VHS and still stands up as the best HUCK and TOM movies. This clasic deserves a DVD release, high calliber acting from the young actors in this forgotten gem."
4,Better May Come.,"I had previously bought one of his after ""Telephone Road"" and it wasn't as good.But this album seems to get back to where he began. From a fast ""Wound Up"" followed by a slower ""You Can Call On The Blues"", his vocal is really good. All the songs after this are great, ""I Do It All For You"", ""Short & Stout"" goes to a more rock genre, with a harmonica by Dave Nevling. Nevling also shines on ""Laugh To Keep From Cryin'"", followed by ""Down For The Count"" back to great Mark guitar & vocal. Over all it's a great album if you're a Mark may fan."
4,My Man Mark May,"Get anywhere near Houston, see my man Mark May and band. Real fine players, great guys, great song selection and great blues-men.Tell them to wear their USS Houston CA-30 T-Shirts and honor our traditional and current vets."
3,Not Bad,"This album is certainly 'listenable'. The title track 'You can call on the blues' stirs the blood. The harp of 'Dave Nevling' adds much to several tracks. 'Big city crime' is also a pulsating highlight and 'Down for the Count' is worth the listen. However, in the end you wonder why you bought this album, as it fails to offer the extended highlights you expect."
5,Uncle Dan'sCountry Dill dressing mix,"Was ectatic to find this product and received VERY promptly...nicely packaged. Would definitely order it again as it is very difficult to find the mix in our local stores, non-existent except via the net now for rural areas."
4,One of the best so far for LCD TV,"This LCD TV is awesome have a multiple and reliable use compare to just LCD itself and the price. I recommended this product especially if you love downloading big files or doing some office work and suddenly got bored, all you need to do is change the source and there you go instant TV with 180 channels to choose from."
5,As good as Bergstrom's MINA!,"Ms. Bergstrom does it again with another exciting vampire novel - this time a continuation of the author's earlier work, ""Mina."" I wasn't expecting to like ""Blood to Blood,"" as much as Mina, but I did. The author's adept ability to create atmosphere and mood are here, as well as her right-on characterizations of Mina, Jonathan, Arthur, and Van Helsing. Bergstrom stays true to the characters Stoker created, but she lets us get to know them better. On center stage with Mina and her friends is the half-sister of Dracula, Joanna. I don't want to give any of the plot away, so I'll just say that the story is seductive, fast-paced, and suspenseful. Fans of ""Mina,"" ""Dracula,"" and other vampire fiction won't be disappointed."
4,A Reed in sheep's clothing.....,"For those of us who think record companies are run by monkees, this release confirms it. This appears to be the 1974 (or was it 5?) album ""Lou Reed Live"" in a different package and title. This kind of release defies explanation! Same track listing, and same lengths of the songs. This is one of Lou's strongest titles. The companion to the incendiary ""Rock and Roll Animal"", this is neck-and-neck in terms of songs, musicianship and excitement. And you won't have to pay 49.99 like some greedy creep has it for a few selections back. (Save that kinda gouging for your local record convention, fella!) A must-have for even a casual Lou Reed fan....."
4,Saachi SA-1440 Coffee Grinder,Very nice coffee grinder. I can make the grounds as fine or thick as necessary. A decent grinder at an affordable price.
1,Weak mottor in grinder,I bought this grinder so I could have fresh coffee in the morning.I used it a total of five times before the motor stopped working.I had already thrown away the box it came in and could not send itback to the seller.I wrote the seller and told them what happened anddid not get a response.Don't waste your money on this product.
2,Lacks Grinding Ability for Spices,"We have been using this product for about a month. It really lacks the grinding ability necessary to grind spices quickly -- it has plenty of speed it appears the double blade simply does not have enough surface area to do the job quickly -- A typical spice mix with the bowl 1/4 full takes 5-10 minutes to grind to an adequate level. Our spice mixes vary but frequently are Anise, Coriander, Fennel Seed, Cardamom, Fenugreek, Cumin.Also, there needs to be a clarification in the description, the actual bowl where the spices are ground is not removable therefore it complicates cleaning."
4,Quiet. Fine quality grinding. compact. lightweight use.,"Saachi Stainless Steel Coffee / Dry Spice Grinder. A Very Popular Model For All Your Grinding Needs. Model SA-1440I purchased 2 of these. Number 1--I have used over 100x to grind lightweight substances like epsom salts. The thing I love the most is it is so quiet when grinding--no harse annoying sounds to my ears. It actually is relaxing to use. Easy to clean. Takes a little getting used to take the lid on and off.This comment is related to #2--I used this one 3x same way and for same products as above and it overheated and quit running. will not reset or restart at all. I apologize for not reporting this to you sooner but I have been dealing with some serious unexpected health problems with a family member and it got pushed to the back burner. I would appreciate a replacement if you could.Either way, I really do love my #1. I just wish I had 2. Thanks for your consideration."
3,grinder,"very quiet, lid is a bit difficult to remove. I was used to turning a coffee grinder over to capture the grinds. The lid on this one is a bit short and won't hold all the ground coffee. It grinds well and I've made adjustments."
2,Disappointed,"Although this grinder looks beautiful out of the box and is quiet, i dont find it grinds all that well. It takes over 30 seconds to grind coffee to fine grind, and even then it grinds unevenly( leaving bits of bean). It also comes with a little brush, which is a good thing as the coffee packs down under the blades, requiring tapping the grinder and removing the coffee with the brush each time. I would not buy it again and am considering buying something else."
2,coffee grinder,The previous coffee grinder I had worked automatically by the grind setting. Unfortunately this one does not and is inconsistent in the grind. I also find it harder to sue for measuring and dumping into the top cup. I wouldn't purchase this type again
4,Nice and sturdy product,"I use this little grinder for making powdered formulas for my dogs. I grind up oats, flaxseeds and eggshells (egg membrane is a main ingredient in those expensive dog joint health pills). Everything becomes a nice fine powder and the noise is minimal. The grinder itself is mostly stainless steel. It comes with a small brush for cleaning, though I bought an extra one just in case. I took off one star because this can be a bit hard to get clean. After I sweep it out, I use a slightly damp paper towel to wipe it out with. You have to be careful while doing this as you can cut yourself on the blades. Overall, this was a good deal. It's a well made and stylish grinder."
2,blades flew off in under a month.,"absolutely stunning, the very best grinder i'd ever had--when i first got it. right now i am just beyond thrilled that amazon will do a no-contest return for items that fall apart & become ENTIRELY USELESS in LESS THAN THIRTY DAYS. i mean, i think it's even too light to use as a doorstop. maybe the motor would run something else but it sure wont grind anything sans blades. & it is surely, & for no reason i can name, BLADELESS COS THE BLADES FLEW OFF. had they not been made of steel they probably wouldve disintegrated.two stars for its wonderful wonder at the beginning. also cos maybe you just cant use a coffee grinder ever day, once a day, like i do? or is that whistling in the wind i hear behind me? or in the dark? unbelievable."
4,"Grinds well, good construction","There are a multiple of things I like about this grinder and one thing I don't.What I don't care for is that the blade is so sharp that it presents a bit of a hazard to the uninitiated, so be careful cleaning. The other possible downside to this is that is more ""chips"" the spices, which for the most part I like, but if you need a fine grind, I found it to take a while.Overall, the grinder is very well constructed and with the caution above, easy to clean."
4,Great Product,I am very happy with this coffee grinder. It is quiet and very effective. I think for the price range you couldn't do much better.
2,Pretty with little power,"I bought the Saachi grinder, as my old great-working Krups is red and didn't match my new granite kitchen. This is a beautiful grinder, but it has little power and only half empties after grinding, requiring the brush to clean it out. I returned the grinder after trying three grindings with the same poor effect. I want my outdated, mismatched Krups back!"
3,So-so,"I like the speed of the grind, but the shape of the grind area is not conducive to easy cleaning. It has no brush included like our old GE either."
4,Not loud.,Not as loud as my Cuisinart coffee grinder was. Grinds the beans to a uniform consistency. 4 stars as it does leave some grinds on the counter that I have to wipe up.
4,Good product,"Every thing as advertised, good looking and works well. Quieter than my last grinder. Don't discard the little brush that comes with the unit as you will need it."
5,working under heavy hands..,My mother had broken 3 to 4 coffee grinders while using them for heavy spices. But this one could still survive from last 2-3 months. Also she likes the quality.
5,makes your daily grind easier -if not finer,"I've used the Saachi Coffee Grinder for two months daily and am impressed with it's strong motor, relative quietness and the fact that it doesn't add a burnt taste to the beans. It also won't turn your grounds into industrial dust powder but that is not a problem for me. I think the cord storage at the base causes too much wear and tear on the cord so I wrap it around the grinder. A high-impact plastic lid would have been preferable."
1,A Grinder to avoid .....,"or if you are like me - replace. Very disappointed in this grinder. I only use this to grind coffee beans and it never mixes the beans well as it grinds, even if you shake the grinder to help it along. General grinding power is not impressive at all either. I always have a clump of ground beans at the bottom and many chunks that ""float"" on the top."
4,"Great grinder, one small glitch!","I am very happy with this grinder. The small glitch is that it does not have settings, so you have to be the judge of how long to grind. The best thing about it is the quality. I have had other grinders that did not last because my husband decided to grind a spice. Killed it! I keep my grinder out at all times so I like the fact that the cord can be shortened around the base. I'm not fighting with too much cord on the counter. Overall, completely content with my purchase!"
2,"It does grind coffee, but...","This was less likable than the Mr Coffee grinder we had been using for a few years. Specifically, you can't remove the bin to dump the coffee, there is no timer for automatic stopping, and there is no adjustment for fine/coarse grind. Plastic lid develops a lot of static and helps grinds fly out of the grinder once it is opened. On the plus side, it is well built - heavy, sturdy - it looks nice, and it does actually grind coffee. We returned it and bought the Capresso Infinity, which we like much more."
2,Does not grind well,Coffee grinder cup is square and the blade is round so beans get in the corners and do not grind.
5,Starbucks without the buzz,"A wonderful way to get the fresh, just ground, taste of starbucks without drinking enough to keep you awake for a couple of days. After grinding I put the beans into a French press and wow what a hit!"
4,Nice Surprise,"I'd grown tired of my Krups - the white plastic had yellowed and it was noisy. I came across this on Amazon from a company I'd never heard of and decided to try it since it was attractive and reasonably-priced. It turned out to be a good purchase - it works well and is quieter. My only complaint is ergonomic - I don't find it fits in the hand very well, but that's minor. One warning - I made the mistake of trying it out, empty, when it first arrived to see about the sound level but didn't realize that the cleaning brush was inside, which created a hole in the lid, so I have to keep my finger over it when using it. But not everyone is as stupid as I am."
4,Awesome and sleek looking grinder with one flaw,I love this grinder. It works perfect for my coffee needs but one flaw: you cannot take out the container in which your coffee beans are ground in! This is a huge disappointment for such a great product. Instead they give you this little tiny brush so you can attempt to clean out your ground up coffee beans. I would give this a 5/5 if they would've just made the container removable.
5,Going beyond correlation...to causation?,"Having attended Alan's class on this subject in 1987, and reading Lowen's and Kent's book as part of this class, this book was a welcome return to the realm of how people process information differently. I am generally familiar with several ""type indicator"" models mostly based on Jung's concepts (MBTI, FIRO etc.) and this model seems to take it beyond that by attaching brain processes to behavior. The model is signficantly refined and improved over the past 15 years, and should provide a great resource for the researcher and for the casual reader. If you like to understand how different people think and are confounded by the chaos created by different personalities coming together, this book will prove to be a invaluable resource. When is the next book, Alan?Vijay K. Iyer, Ph. D.; M.B.A.Director, Corporate Business Development,Respironics, Inc."
2,Treeless Mountain,"A similar theme was explored in the movie Nobody Knows( read my review) which looked at abandonment of children but was incredibly depressing. In Treeless Mountain a mother drops off her children to live with her alcoholic sister in law. The sister in law who gets tired of them and is unable to provide and care, finally drops them off to live with their grandparents. Initially the little girls are fearful of life at a farm but eventually come to love it.I did not enjoy the movie as much and would give it just two stars only because the two little girls' acted superbly, complete naturals they make the story come alive. Two stars 02/09/10"
1,Ugh.,"I love all kinds of independent and artsy films...this was boring. And I've seen many movies that everyone else would consider boring, and yet I've appreciated them. This dvd has a great cardboard cover and beautiful pictures, but the film itself is not worth watching. Very disappointed."
5,very moving film,"Treeless Mountain was an interesting look into the lives of two Korean children that were abandoned by their mother.It was neat seeing the emotions and perspective from Jin and Bin's eyes. The determination to succeed at their quest of getting their mother back to them was touching. I found myself rooting for the girls and hoping that their mother would actually come back for them once they filled the piggy bank. I really enjoyed watching the progress of the piggy bank, and the creative ideas that Jin would come up with to fill it up as fast as they could.The young actress that plays Jin (Hee Yeon-Kim) did a really good job expressing all the emotions and portraying her character very well. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film, and I would definitely recommend it."
5,This Item is a great gift,"The person, who receive this MOVIE, stated!!, It a great gift to have,I Love it,It's five stars all the way, ST."
3,ok,"Although the plot was not very reasonable, the movie was rescued by temple's ability to sing and dance, and her cute-ness."
2,Sweet little movie but very dangerous for it's time,"The movie The Littlest Rebel was a very cute, sweet little movie- fun family entertainment. The story of a little ''Southern Belle'', and her mission to rescue her father from the Yankee Troups, and later execution. The plot is pretty standard, Shirley of course is a very cute, and a quite appealing young actress. But the film's message is slippery, even dangerous at times. Incorrectly portraying black slaves as carefree, happy, childlike and ignorant, this movie was one of many which reinforced the South's idea of a ''happy slave.'' This was dangerous considering that at this time segregation and discrimination were rampant in Southern cities. The movie itself is sweet and family-oriented, very worth seeing, but the film is symbolic of a very dangerous system and idea."
2,Size Matters,I was disappointed because the boards were smalls. There was no size listed on the information and I didn't realize there were different sizes until I received the boards and found out that they were too small for my kids to use. I called the company and the person I talked to did not know anymore about them than I did. She was supposed to call me back and never did. I sent them back for a refund which cost me $15 to mail and I have still not received the refund. I will not buy anything from this site again just because of the hassle of returning items.
2,Didn't really like it,"It is attractive to small kids which is a plus, but the volume is so extremely low you can hear the motion of the toy and not your music."
2,Nothing new here...,"This book was pretty much a waste of money, especially if you have any ASP programming experience and take time to look at and learn from the included sample stores that come with MSCS. Worse yet is that the code in the book contains erros and there are no updates or other information on the publisher's web site to acknowledge it (or seemingly any interest of them to even reply to my reports). Microsoft's TechNet has helpful resources and is free online at their web site. Wrox also publishes a book called Site Server 3.0 Commerce Edition which isn't much better. It seems that most book publishers are taking the information presented in the Microsoft Official Curriculum Course (1231) and keep rehasing the same old stuff over and over and over... Anyone who thinks they can master Business to Consumber or Business to Business commerce by reading this book, Wrox's or taking Microsoft's own course will be in a for a disappointing surprise."
1,Failing Batteries in 90 days,"After just 3 months this phone's batteries are already failing! This is now the second cordless in a row I've bought with short-lived batteries. The other was a Panasonic that cost around $20.Even with it's low $14.99 price tag, the GE Cordless 2.4 GHz 27831FE1 Phone has proven to be a bad bargain. We could get a new set of batteries with GE's one year warranty, but this phone may not be worth keeping.Its low-contrast, badly lit LCD is so hard to read, it's sometimes almost useless. This may be good excuse to go find a better phone.The moral to this review is that a good brand name does not assure quality and a low price does not guarantee economy."
1,Dissappointed customer,"I purchased this telephone in October 2006 and as of today, 1/9/2007, this telephone no longer functions. I have purchased a replacement phone of a different brand........"
2,meh,it is cheap and performs like a cheap phone. battery is dead after about a year. the volume is low. the screen started to fail. the coverage is average at best. you can do better for a few bucks more
1,Scrappy phone,"I bought this phone and after a few months it began to lose signal, make weird noises and turn off after just 15 or 20 minutes talking after being charging the whole day.I really don't recommend neither this phone nor anyone from this branch."
3,Handy phone,Handy phone for the price- it's a deal.Only two drawbacks.1. The ring is not very loud2. The call timer starts from when you press talk long before the call is even engaged.
2,No Thank You!,"This phone is horrible -- the sound quality is terrible, the caller id display is extremely faint, and there is constant static that sometimes i have to hang up in the middle of a call and redial just to get rid of the noise. my cheap radioshack 900mhz phone that i've had for 4 years is waaaay better. the only plus about this GE phone is that the battery life is great."
2,GE Cordless Telephone,"This phone works fine for us, however, when it rings, and we pick up another phone in the house to answer, this phone keeps on ringing, one solid ring and doesn't stop for a few seconds after another phone has been picked up to answer. Again, I can't send it back to be replaced because my 30 days are up. And again, I won't be ordering another phone from you."
4,"GREAT CORDLESS PHONE, BUT...................","This phone works great, especially for its low cost. My only complaint would be that the screen is hard to read. The screen is yellow-green and the letters are too light and small to be easily read unless you are a young whipper-snapper (never did know exactly what that means, but that's what Dad called the ""youngins"")."
5,Item cost $89.00 plus shipping.,This 2-volume Bible is more than worth the price. I findit to be a rare and exceptional addition to both myspiritual life and my library. You will count yourselffortunate if you also obtain it.
3,Caution! Use with care!,"This may be an accurate translation of Jerome's Vulgate, but it is NOT an accurate translation of the original texts. It's useful primarily as a comparative tool. Anyone who would recommend this as THE Bible for Catholics has been watching too many old Bing Crosby movies. Nostalgia can be a dangerous thing."
5,A Bible that sings to the soul,"I couldn't put this Bible down. There is something downright inspiring about it. The language is reverent, yet direct. The footnotes reflect interpretations that are faithful to the Magisterium of the Church and the cross references are very helpful for study purposes. I don't know what took me so long to get a copy of this translation but I'm glad I did. I think every Catholic should get one."
4,Tasty crackers,"The Teriyaki gives these healthy crackers a great flavor. Baked not fried, low-cal. They are so good it's really hard to eat just a few."
2,changing edition,you are not good becuase you changed my order last time. i ordered forth edition and you sent third edition
4,great book in the classical textbook sense,"i would like to again point out that while this book is excellent as a reference, it's not very good to read cover-to-cover. Papoulis is extremely knowledgeable in this area, and this book is, in fact, the FIRST EVER book of stochastic/random variables and processes written for the engineers. unfortunately, despite the excellent material, the presentation and coverage is sometimes hard to follow, and hides the true gem in this book."
4,"Rigour, not ease.","This book is probably not the best book for a beginner (and I've used Haykin and Peebles before). However, it treats probability with a scientific rigour, and follows logical proofs that any of us could do. I think a person could learn from it, but expect it to serve as a 2nd level text or a reference."
2,This is a reference book and it is not good for learning,"In very short words this book is just a very long stream of random processes equations with some explanation in between. At the same time, the cross index at the end is not very complete, this makes looking for an answer difficult (try just to put together the most fundamental properties of a Gaussian Process if you doubt about this).One good feature of this book (and maybe this is why it's so widely used) is that it covers a very extensive list of topics."
3,Good Book so far,Definitely a good book to start off on Random Processes. The writing needs a little reworking. The material is good. The typos make it a little inconsistent. Good for grad school.
1,Not a good textbook,"IMO, this is not a good textbook. On one hand, it never explains the purpose of the materials. I know it elaborates on the random variables and different distributions and a lot of materials in detail, but I don't know where can I use these things. On the other hand, it omits the mathematical details, too. So when I read this book, I found unclear points everywhere. Someone else recommended this book as a good engineer reference. I think that might be true if there were less errors. I find errors in the equations every two or three pages. Engineers may not need to know the details, and they know what they need to model their designs. But they need the ""correct"" thing to do that. Maybe that is not the author's fault but McGraw-Hill's, but to me, a reader of the textbook, it is the same. No recommendation of this book."
5,Great book on statistics,"I have to use probability and statistics in my professional research, but have very minimal training in the area. This book has been great for getting me up to speed and understanding the finer details. I originally borrowed it from my research library, but enjoyed it so much that I bought a copy when I moved to a new institution."
2,Classics are not always great.,"I've been told by many professors that this is *the* classic text on the topic. You might think this would make it *the* book to read on the topic, but it is definately *not* a classic introductory textbook. Everyone in my class complained about it. I found particularly frustrating it's hiding of important theorems, identities, etc. in examples rather than in the main flow of the text."
2,An unfortunate staple,"If you are like me, you are required to purchase this book.Be warned, your the class you are taking will be one of the worst you have ever taken. This book is of little help. Just as a little spoiler, the answers to chapter 2 questions can be found in chapter 3. Be prepared for this kind of ill mannered writing and to ask your professor for a great deal of help.I am very disappointed and hope someone else can come up with a better written book for this course. Who would put themselves through that kind of torturer?"
1,A miserable text for an engineering class.,"This is appearantly the classic text on probablility and stochastic processes for engineering. Someone has got to be able to do better than this. The author commits the classic error of defining everything very precisely, without ever saying what any of it means. I have to agree with the previous reviewer (doubtless a frustrated student like myself) that this is probably a good reference book for those who already understand the subject. Unfortunately, the explanations are overly mathematical, the index is incomplete, and the script typeface used for special characters and symbols is often incomprehensible (an alphabet table would help). The examples and exercises fail to relate the material to practical applications. As an engineer, I'm not interested in proofs and mathematical rigor- I'm interested in the math as a tool and understanding what I can do with it, and how to go about doing it."
2,Good but too difficult,"This book seems to be the classical text on probability in engineering and computer science programs, but is definitely not an introductory textbook. The explanations are overly mathematical. As an engineering student, I'm not interested in proofs and mathematical rigor-I'm interested in understanding how probability works and can be used in practical applications. A much better book in this respect is the recent book by Tijms with wonderful examples and exercises."
4,Easy to read and a enjoyable fantasy escape.,"Mutants Amok is the first of a 5 book series. The story line is based in the future where the human race uses genitics to wage war. They created the ultimate fighting race, but didn't count on them taking over and enslaving the human race in the process. Among the enslaved humans are rebels that are fighting to destroy the mutants. Among the rebels is the infamous MAX TURKEL, who blows away alot of the muties. The rest you will have to read for yourself. Its good old blow em up and shooting book. Unfortunately there is only five books in the series and I don't believe Mark Grant wrote any more."
3,"Decent, but falsely advertised","At the time I ordered this item, the documentation said that it worked on Windows 98 SE, which it did not. The only thing that saved this was when I hooked up another computer with XP."
5,Lonely island pick,"I'm from Holland and a fan from the beginning. Unfortunately they only performed here once. In my opinion this band is very much underrated - I really don't know why their earlier albums aren't reissued on cd. This album is a big surprise; for me it's their best they made so far and I couldn't believe they were able to improve their songwriting and playing. No one sings ballads better and more sensitive than Earnie, who can play such melodic solo's like Earl. Highlights are: ""Am I losing you"", ""All I gave"" and of course the unforgettable ""After this time"",here they reach a peak little bands can follow. I think it's clear that this album is one of my favourits and I keep on listen it - it still thrills me after all those years."
2,So so,"The gel rest is too hard, and the mouse pad part is smaller than a regular mousepad and too slick for ball mouse device. Works okay with optical mouse device, but like I said it's just so-so. The design is on the bottom and is viewed through the transparent gel. Looks okay."
2,Not her best,"Generally dull and lifeless, ""Heartbreaker"" finds Dolly Parton long on charm, but short on excitement or originality. The idea of disco Dolly (the song ""Baby I'm Burning"") is one that should have been nixed long before she arrived in the studio. In short, an occasionally enjoyable, but ultimately forgettable album. Dolly has done much better."
1,Ugh!,"This is an album that is a textbook case on how a remarkable talent can completely shun her roots in favor of turning a quick buck on the pop market. This was just downright painful to listen to back in 1978 when it was first released and is even more so today. ""Baby I'm Burning"" has got to be the worst song Dolly has ever recorded and heaven only knows why anybody needs to hear it today. The rest of the album is not quite as dreadful, but is a far cry from what Parton was capable of doing then and is capable of doing today."
5,Blast from the Past,"I had the ""vinyl"" and never thought I would find the CD. What a trip down memory lane. Thanks a bunch!"
5,MUST HAVE!!,When the album came out in my day. I fell in love with every song. I listened to it again. And now i'm going out to get get CD. You never get tired it. Once you listen to this cd you'll consider it one of your absolute favorites.
5,HEARTBREAKER,"According to the TITLE this is Dolly's ""Heartbreaker"" album. Which was released a few years back as an Original Masters Album. The ""Heartbreaker"" CD is an awesome CD from the first song ""I Really Got The Feeling"" to the last song ""I Wanna Fall In Love"" and of course the title track ""Heartbreaker."" If this Album is anything like the Original.. I reccomend it MUCH......"
5,April Gornik's stunningly impressive ethereal landscapes,"April Gornik: Paintings And Drawings is a collaboration between the Neuberger Museum of Art (Purchase, New York) and the Hudson Hills Press. Featuring an informative essay Fictional Freedom: April Gornik's Landscapes by distinguished art critic Donald Kuspit, and a conversation by Dede Young (curator of Modern and contemporary Art for the Neuberger Museum of Art) with April Gornik on and about here work, this superbly presented 167-page monograph beautifully showcases April Gornik's stunningly impressive ethereal landscapes, flawless technical skills, and her own unique ""inner eye"" as an artist revealing here aesthetic interpretation of natural images. Additionally enhanced with listings of exhibitions, collections, awards, bibliography, and an index, April Gornik is an important, core addition to personal and academic 20th Century Art History collections."
4,High wheel Cultivator,"The high wheel cultivator is one the easiest ways to cultivate weeds right up against the crop. I like using it more than a hoe. I lay off rows with the single point plow, and it will cover rows as well. I sure do like mine and I use it alot."
4,UPS shipping is great! Product is good.,The product is good if you have a tiller. I would have preferred a high wheel cultivator with the oak handle but there was a long wait for shipping this product.I was told to allow 7-10 days for shipping but I received the product by UPS in 2 days. That's what brown did for me.
3,good books,"it is a very good book, to read and learn, it is for my children, and will be helpful for their future, I ordered a few other books too."
3,Fun for TV viewers,"My wife and I enjoyed this movie on our honeymoon. Not only were we intrigued to see it because of enjoying Tom Selleck in ""Magnum PI"" and Ted Danson in ""Cheers"", but also a movie directed by Mr. Spock! So, because of nostalgia, we bought soon after it came out on video. Now we enjoy seeing various stars in bit parts.Wilson from ""Home Improvement""The grandmother from ""Promised Land""The manager from ""News Radio""Is Tom Sellecks girlfriend in that new show, ""Now and Again""?The mother from that couple in New York show that went off the air last year."
3,A Funny but Dated Movie,I ordered this movie to entertain a 7-year-old girl. Thank god she was not interested in it because when both her dad and I had seen it in the theater back when it originally came out we were adults and the swearing throughout and sexual comments didn't bother us but we certainly didn't want her to hear it in movies at her current age; maybe when she's 10 or 11 and has a little more understanding. And I had seen it a few time with my much older nieces when they were pre-teens and teenagers so they were more age appropreiate. I guess PG in 1987 is not what PG is today.
4,comedy,"great movie for the family, three excellent actors, and actress combine to make you laugh, at their antics of raising children."
3,Good Movie,"This film is funny. Not laugh out loud, side splitting funny, but a general stream of laughs and giggles, as three mean womanisers have their sensitive and caring sides brought out by having to look after a baby.So, in that sense it not only works as a comedy, but as a heartfelt family movie; and that happy ending is so happy you just wanna jump and shout 'Isn't good to be alive'. A pleasant film to watch."
1,crap movie,"im mad my video was broken didnt work from the start, it wasn't even the right movie.I put the movie in and it was all high pitched squeeling noises. what i could make out of this mess was not even the movie i bought. i am mad and when i wanted to be able to send an email or call customer service, i couldnt amazon does not have that. i am one angry customer. wasted my birthday money and this was suppose to be my birthday presant i had searched for it everywhere!"
5,Real ghost...,If u believe that boy is a cut out..Ur nutz...1st look real good @ em... He'll bring chills down ur spine...Also that is not his only appearance... He appears again buy a balcony outside... Why in the hell is the movie industry going to purchase a house 2 not use it...The mother of the child saw her son...Thats enough for me and in his burial clothes...No body makes something up like that...Not even 2 b on TV...U believe wat u want but y so much cover up...If he's not real...
2,Misled,"DVD was advertised as ""New, sealed in package"", yet the security tape was cut and a new one was put on in a different spot, and there were big fingerprints all over the disc, so I highly doubt it was ""brand new"", it appeared to have been resealed. But the movie played fine."
4,Three Men review,I think this is a very excellent movie. I would highly recommend it for anyone that likes family type movies.
4,Great Family Friendly Movie,"Ah, the Eighties. The soundtrack of this movie alone brings a nostalgic tear to my eye. Okay, this movie didn't blow us away with its depiction of bachelorhood, but it did make me laugh, and what more can a person really want in a movie? Steve Guttenberg, Tom Selleck, and Ted Danson are the Three Muskateers Plus Baby. By the way, when compared to its sequel, Three Men and a Little Lady, this movie DOES look like a masterpiece. Good movie -- one you can certainly enjoy with your own little ones, and Grandma and Grandpa."
2,Great photos but poor in quality,"This CD is hyped as a professional quality portfolio of the scenic southwest. While the photos are synchronized with the text of volume 1, which is helpful in visualizing the locations, The quality of the photos is not worth the $19.95. Since I was disappointed, I returned the CD and was reimbursed the sum of $6.95 for my troubles. If you are looking for quality photos, don't waste your time, and money!"
3,don't forget the gaff tape,These are designed well as they are easy to attach to the hoops and easy to adjust. I'm not sure what microphone would stay in the mic clip because the vibrations from the drum will cause it to drop out of the clip and onto the head. I've used gaff tape to keep my sm57's in place and might see about getting some clamp type mic clips to see if that will do the trick.
2,Nightmare in Monarch country,"I, like many others I am sure, bought this movie since it was based in Scotland and starred Alastair Mackenzie from 'Monarch of the Glen'. I know you should not assume that all an actor's movies will be in the same genre but this movie is as like 'Monarch' as Dracula is like St Francis of Assisi. It is raw, gory and sexually explicit. The murder scene at the end involves one of the most graphic abuse scenes I have seen in any movie. Obviously this is not the film that I was expecting. The movie is well made, performances are good but the film cannot seem to make up its mind whether it is an action story, a supernatural spooky, or an examination of supressed sexual desire (those desires include masturbation, cross dressing and raw sexual intercourse). Not a film I could recommend and definitely not in the 'Monarch of the Glen' genre."
3,Printing Quality,"This book is a quick reference to get familiar with SONAR. But, the printing quality is terrible. The publisher should consider inproving the quality of the pictures showing SONAR Views, Dialog boxes, etc."
1,Not worth the money.,"Got this for my 6 y.o. son as a gift. Literally took him about 1 minute to ""dig"" thru the egg to get the dinosaur. Very disappointing as the digging was why he was interested. It cost $[...] (price plus s/h) for a $[...] dinosaur and 1 minute of enjoyment. Wouldn't recommend it."
4,"No problems, works as advertised","I have used this product for about 2 decades. Not only does it work as advertised, I have never had any damage to the many pairs of glasses I have used it on. I like to read while relaxing in a hot tub. Before getting in, I clean my glasses with Kleer Vu so they do not fog up. I am very active outdoors and never have a problem with my glasses fogging up. It will last most of the day. Some active days it takes a second cleaning in the afternoon. I carry a small bottle for this cleaning. It also works well on binoculars in all weather conditions.The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars, it is hard to find. I have been buying it from a very nice older couple working a booth at the Portland Oregon Sportsman's Show. I have not been able to attend the show for several years and need more Kleer Vu. I was very happy to find this very good product available at Amazon."
1,caution do not use on eye glasses,I used kleer vu on 2 pairs of eye glasses and it ruined the protective coating on both pairs of glasses. The product was used as directed and resulted in me having to buy two pairs of glasses at the cost of $384 and $400. DO NOT USE ON EYE GLASSESIHAVE REQUESTED REIMBERSEMENT FOR BOTH PAIRS OF GLASSES
4,A chill that warms,"I took a chance on this compilation because it included some recognizable names (Moby, Morcheeba, Dido, etc.) but the big surprise is how many terrific cuts it contains by lesser-known artists - including great tracks by artists unfamiliar to me, such as Sounds From the Ground, Neon Heights and Jakata. It's easy to imagine these discs being played in a chill-out room at some underground club, but it's also a wonderful mood setter for a low-key party or a late-night drive. If you like to sway to trip hop beats and you're a fan of artists like Moby, Everything But the Girl or Hooverphonic, you will not be disappointed with this excellent two-CD set."
2,The Worst of the Best,"This album has no substance, no power, or good songs on it. As soon as I saw Massive Attack, Moby, and Dido, I knew it would be good. I was wrong. This album has the worse of the best, and the worse of the worse. Most of the songs on here are boring, and badly organized, I had to skip most of the album and still didn't find any decent song. The only good songs on here are; Dido, and the theme song from ""American Beauty"". I suggest no one buy this album beacause their are no gems on it. No song stands out that makes you want to listen again. It would be a good lulluby album or yoga, if it were without the other songs such as Massive Attack, Dido, the ones they put on it to try and save it. In my opinion, they failed."
2,"So close, yet...not quite.","I love Massive Attack. I hate, with a passion, 'Hymn of the Big Wheel'. Come on! Poor Horace Andy sounds like he's hurling in that song! I'm really trying to like this compilation. Some songs are wonderful (Dido, Gorillaz, Morcheeba, Royksopp, Badly Drawn Boy, Chem. Bros.), but then they want to include Goldfrapp's 'Utopia', which is a brilliant song, but the track included in the Ultra compilation is some [bad] mix that doesn't even begin to portray the beauty that is the original uncut song. WTF?! I feel lightly ripped-off, like I've been had. So, I'm going to edit my copy of Ultra Chilled Vol. 1 and burn my own edit (and include the original 'Utopia') so I can at least enjoy the good parts. But seriously, it shouldn't have to be like this."
2,not what i thought it would be,"Dont get me wrong , there are alot of great tracks but the cd quickly loses its magic, even more so on cd 2 .they couldnt even play the full version of the classic papua new guinea-one of the reasons i decided to buy this cd."
2,Pretty Boring and Worthless,"This CD compilation is actually pretty boring and tired. It's probably OK if you spend your whole life listening to top 40 radio, but if you actually have a decent collection of music, steer clear. I was fairly excited when I bought it, but when it arrived, I realized I had just foolishly bought my 5th boring compilation containing such overplayed tracks such as Thievery Corporation's ""The Glass Bead Game"", and K+D's ""Original Bedroom Rockers"". I mean, come on. All the music on this two disk set was pretty cool several years ago. But now you here it everywhere from Lexus commercials to Levi's ads.The real shame here is that record companies are always going to put out lame, boring stuff as long as some dumb sap is stupid enough to buy it. In this case, the dumb sap is ME. Don't do the same thing to yourself. Go pick up something good instead, like one of the Naked Music compilations (Nude Dimensions 1-3, Carte Blanche, etc.), Om Lounge, Paris Lounge, etc."
3,Are You Kidding Me???,"Disc One is excellent, however, Disc Two is a blatant clone of Nick Warren's Back To Mine disc. Buy that instead. Don't waste your time or money."
2,Ultra bore,I really like chill music when I am working and relaxing but this had to be the biggest disappointment of all the chill CD's that I have purchased from Dido's poorly constructed vocal to whereever some of the other tracks got their inspiration it sounds like a compilation of leftovers.
1,this cd is no good,this cd is compiled of old music circa 2000 and early 2001. I would love to recommend great stuff but that would be doing everyone a favor :) If you are a generic listner and starting out go for the hed kandi compilations they are much suited for you and the selection is above average. I have had most of all these singles invidually through albums of the artists themselves. Look at massive attack track alone that was like 1991 from the blue lines album you figure!
5,good mellow downtempo grooves,This is a great cd. Song after song rolls by and the sounds keep getting deeper. Cd two is the one I like the best so far. Nice mixes and the whole thing is balanced from end to end. Definately a lot of really cool songs for the money.
4,"A cool collection of various trip hop, laid back beats","I have read several reviews about this CD,...I was intruiged, heard that Moby,Gorillaz and Dido were on it I was interested. After all, everyone needs some smooth tracks now and again. When I found out a St. Germain track was on it I was very pleasantly surprised. While critics will make light of the light of the fact that it may be a very basic introduction to slow trip-hopesque beats, that is its basic selling premise. If you want to find out what kind of atists in the genre would appeal to you buy this CD,..it has something for everyone,..I guarantee you will enjoy multiple tracks,.."
2,Pretty Boring and Worthless,"This CD compilation is actually pretty boring and tired. It's probably OK if you spend your whole life listening to top 40 radio, but if you actually have a decent collection of music, steer clear. I was fairly excited when I bought it, but when it arrived, I realized I had just foolishly bought my 5th boring compilation containing such overplayed tracks such as Thievery Corporation's ""The Glass Bead Game"", and K+D's ""Original Bedroom Rockers"". I mean, come on. All the music on this two disk set was pretty cool several years ago. But now you here it everywhere from Lexus commercials to Levi's ads."
5,The Best CDS Yet,"When I first heard the cd, I was like man, this would be awesome to chill too, not knowing it was called Ultra Chill. When i found out i knew i had to have it so i bought volume 1 and 2. I loved Volume 1 with Nigntmares on Wax, Gorillaz, Dido, and many more. But when i put in Volume 2 i have to admit i was a little disappointed. But all in all i love both cds and if had a second chance would DEFINATELY buy agian."
2,Bummer...,"I really wanted to like it! I liked the song clips. I'm a fan of Moby, Zero 7, Massive Attack, & Badly Drawn Boy, but, unfortunately, this collection sounds slapped together like the tapes that are playing at those ""too cool for you"" stores at the mall. Dissapointing."
5,Excellent cable that allows select frequencies in,"A very good quality 75ohm cable that is finely constructed and designed to elimate all electrical interference, except the intergalatic frequency band. This improved my cable reception over the standard cable company's brand, and it allows aliens from the planet Basilak to communicate directly with my cat while I enjoy television. As we speak, my cat is receiving instructions on building a time travel machine constructed of three simple products: kibble, litter, and a wool ball."
3,"""The Book Of Fetish""","I would give this book 3-1/2 stars because the book contains some sexually explicit text that would offend some people like me. But I don't want to offend anyone who has some form of fantasy. However, I'm a diaper fetishist. Fetishism is my main part of my topic here. That's were my early traits came from. I know that god loves us and understand of our sexuality. Human beings can make mistakes sometimes in life. All we want is love, that is! (To Be Continued)"
5,"Men in love, by Nancy Friday","Even though this book was printed a long time ago, it is still very relevant. I was surprised how great of a shape it was in(almost untouched, ready to be a gift if need be). I would recomend the sender to a friend, as well as the book itself. It touches very deep subjects of human nature and sexuality. After starting to read it, I can't get enough of my husband!! Dear girls and women: please find and read this masterpiece!! It will open your eyes, minds and hearts."
3,Read this before assembling...,"I'm using this as storage rather than a desk. Weighs less than I was expecting for particle board product. Door came without mounting holes for magnet. Some assembly dowels were not included. Instructions and hardware are the reason for only 3 stars.Before assembling note: Instructions do not differentiate between the right and left side (labeled ""B"" in the instructions) But, the hinge mounting holes on each side are not centered top to bottom, so the sides are not the same. The right and left side panels can be separated by the hinge mounting holes. These mounting holes must be assembled toward the door hinge (down) for the hinges to mount properly."
4,Good book,It's a good book with short explanations that lead you to a good knowledge about grammar. Only the CD is not so good.
5,Awesome Cd,"This cd has a lot of great protest songs on it.They mean as much now as they did in the 60's & 70's. My favorite is One Tin Soldier, that one has been so hard to find on a cd, but Amazon had it."
5,Best Gluten Free Bread Bar None!,"Gluten has been a problem for me for at least 30 years. Until this bread, I had to make do with crumbly, dry odd-tasting 'breads', some of which gave me heartburn(rice.) This bread, however, is delicious as is(when fresh) for sandwiches. It tends to dry out if kept too long. That usually isn't a problem, since it is tasty. Toasted it is slightly 'chewy', which I like(reminds me of bagels.) My only complaint is that the slices are too small. The price here is definitely better. My health store charges over$2 more per loaf. Many places carry only the rice bread, which I don't seem to digest well."
3,Not quite what was expected,"I've had tapioca bread at Disney that was soft and wonderful.. thought this would be the same.. its a bit stiffer, but tastes pretty good toasted with butter but still isn't quite as soft as I hoped it would be for sandwiches.That said, its better than most rice breads I've had."
3,Great product but it was out of date!,I like taht I can get the Tapioca bread on Amazon because Whole food is sometimes out of it but the box I received was already out of date. The shelf life is long on this so I shouldn't have received out of date product.
4,Good alternative,"My daughter, who just turned 13, loves this bread (she has a wheat allergy). She heats it in microwave for 10 seconds and puts butter on it. She eats it every day. I also cannot eat wheat and I like it better toasted. Good alternative to the real thing...but you will find nothing is just like the gluten version!"
1,Barely a step above cardboard,"On first glance this bread looks great, but tastewise is a whole different story. DRY DRY DRY, crumbly, and bland. I tried toasting it to see if that would improve tastes, but it just made it worse.I was hoping to find a good, affordable vegan product to have in the pantry but no such luck"
3,Great to have on the shelf for bread anytime.,"Okay, not the best tasting bread, but it's convenient and shelf-stable. I keep a few loaves for backup and in case of emergencies. Must be toasted."
4,It makes yummy toast!,"Ener-G tapioca bread makes wonderful toast. I'd be hard pressed to tell the difference between it and regular white bread toasted. Ener-G company is very allergy aware. We deal with severe multiple food allergies at our home to milk, egg, peanut, and sesame and gluten intolerance. The bread is OK right out of the bag, but toasted it is really good."
4,Price jump?!,"This bread was originally around $21 for a package of 6. Now it has jumped to almost $38?! Much cheaper to buy in the store now, so I will not be ordering it again until the price is decreased. I cannot justify paying over $6 for a loaf of bread, even as much as I like this brand."
5,Tastes like sourdough,"I was delighted to find Ener-G foods here and at my local Sprouts market. It is the first gluten free bread that didn't feel heavy and taste awful. The only unpleasant thing about it is the fragrance from the bag - smells a bit like sourdough. It is great toasted, and makes great sandwiches plain.I can't tolerate gluten and this puts sandwiches (that I can enjoy) back on the menu."
3,Gets the job done,"Pretty cheap quality, but for $15 what do you expect? I looked it up on zzsounds first to see what size mics it holds and it fits up to 1.9 inch diameter condenser mics and mine was 1.85. when i got it and tried to put it in, it didn't fit. I had to rip out the padding/cushion on the inside for it to fit. I would say the biggest it will fit with the padding would be 1.7 inches. make sure your mic will fit before buying or you might have to do what I did."
4,Good shock mount,"I bought this to attach a condensor mic to a Hercules NS866B stand since the threads are the same size. The onlycomplaint I have is that I can see the tension on lock wearing out over time because you really have to tighten it downto keep the shock mount from tipping from the weight of the mic, but the shock mount itself holds the mic nicely."
2,Picked up a second one has the same problem the screw breaks,The product has an inherent flaw. The screw to tighten the knob becomes loose after a very short while. This keeps making the mike go flip flop - more dangerous for a sensitive mike like a Neumann that I use. Unfortunately Neumann's original shock mounts are very expensive and the TLM 102 does not come with a shock mount.
4,Good for smaller mics only,"The fit was too tight on my AT2020, so make sure you check the mic dimensions before you purchase this item. It is a good price and does its job if your mic is on the smaller side. Worth the price"
2,Informative but poorly organized,"The subject matter is interesting enough to get each of us buy a copy of the book. But the book itself is not that interesting though. Each chapter is written to bombard the readers with different stories of the blonde, revealing the cultural history of the hair colour. However, the author did not do in-depth discussion. At some point, the pace of each chapter is too quick. After reading the book, our knowledge about blondes is still the same. The book does not impress me by giving me something I do not know.Pitman perhaps has done a better job on researching than on writing."
1,On Bleached Brunettes,"Joanna Pitman's book ""On Blondes"" continues the absurdity of using the name Blonde for Brunettes that are bleached.Brunettes are not Blonde. Bleached hair is not Blonde hair. Bleached Brunette women are not Blonde women.A book that was actually about Blondes would not include Bleached Brunettes.carolecox@blondfrombirth.org"
5,Beautiful. Hone is a prophet,"I recently had the honor of meeting the 80 year-old Hone at a poetry reading in Christchurch (New Zealand). To me, a New Zealander, Hone Tuwhare I regard as a living prophet. Open any New Zealand book of verse and Hone will fill a good twenty pages. It is impossible for me to say how important this man is to our country. His poetry is mystical, political, romantic - he captures the landscape and its people like no-one else ever has. You don't have to be a New Zealander to enjoy these either - they will be, I assure you, the most beautiful, energetic, natural, informed poems you will ever have the pleasure of reading. and in no way am I going to be able to put across the sheer wisdom that is ""Deep river talk"" with a list of adjectives. Its like cummings got lost in wilderness with Thomas Wolfe and built a monastery and they all came out drinking and laughing and singing Maori spirituals. Hell - just read it for yourself."
5,A delightful book!,"Wilma Fellman has written a warm, insightful, entertaining book of poetry about living with the ADD experience. If you think you've read ""every"" book on ADD, think again. This one is in a category and class by itself. I recommend it for people who have ADD, and also for those people in your life who might have difficulty ""getting"" what ADD is about. Adults and children can relate to Wilma's poems and go ""aha! that's me!"" My personal favorite is ""Lima Beans, Brocolli, and Liver"" which describes what a little girl with ADD goes through in a classroom -- much better than any book on kids with ADD can describe it. I like this book a lot and highly recommend it."
5,Truly Glorious!,If you are looking for an Ode to Greens this is it! The recipes take a fresh approach to preparing vitamin/mineral rich dark green leafy vegetables.
5,"If you buy farm shares, you need this book","This year we finally bought a share in a local farm and now, each week, I have to deal with things like chard and kale and collard greens. This book saved us! Not only does it demystify these greens, it actually made us love them! Who knew my meat-loving husband would love kale! Who knew I would discover that I like chard and kale better than spinach! This book is already changing our diets and is a must-have if you do the whole CSA thing. I highly recommend getting a farm share and then buying this book - you will be healthier for it!"
5,great recipes,"I enjoy this book and refer to it often. very easy to cook, delicious foods. Answers the questions on how to prepare all of those wonderful vegetables in the grocery store!"
5,EASY To Understand!,"This book is a great addition to any kitchen! The book is well written and you can tell it was written by people that are not professional cooks. There are no ingredients listed that you'd be shaking your head and asking ""Where in the world do I find this?!"".This is a great book for beginners in the kitchen as it tells you how to choose the best greens in the grocery store if you've never had to shop for this before, how to properly clean them before using cooking them, and the few recipes I've already tried are amazing!Being a weight watchers member and really wanting to improve my health, this book has helped because it allows me to eat better without the frustration of figuring out how to make greens taste good!"
5,Greens Glorious Greens Glorious,Fantastic book! It is the one book I give to all my clients. A must read for vibrant health. The book came in excellent condition and was delivered on time.
4,I wish there were recordings of his operatic performances,"I think Ms. Rich must have found every review that was ever published. A large portion of the book is reproductions of and copied reviews. I'm sure this was done to flesh out the meager supply of eyewitness and recollections of Mr. Eddy's years prior to 1935 when he first appeared in Naughty Marietta. I liked it and it was a needed reference to supplement Ms. Rich's definitive ""Sweethearts""."
2,Not bad but does not fulfill what I expected,"I was doing an in depth study of MacDonald and Eddy and had just finished reading Edward Turk's scholaraly biography of Jeanette MacDonld. I was looking forward to ""The Opera Years"" telling me deteails about just that but instead I found very little details and very much about Jeanette that varied somewhat from what Turk had written. Ms. Rich did not do what I expected which was to give me some details about how Nelson Eddy did durint his opera years. I got a little but not more than I could have had from using the internet. I would not recommend this book. Sorry."
2,Review of Opers Years of Nelson Eddie,The collection of reviews which forms the main body of the book is useful to have. I thought the short biographical section to be short on hard facts and angledto infer a love affair between Nelson and Jeanette.Margaret Blair
2,Not So Hot,This was purchased because we like the Circulon Cookware and use it exclusively. However if I had looked at the teakettle in the store I would not have purchased it. The kettle is heavy and I never know how much water is in it. There is a maximum fill line but no way to know how close you are to the line. The latch does not work to keep the spout lid open.
1,Broke a few days after it was opened.,"This was cheaply constructed and the plastic broke (from heat?) a few days after my gift recipients put it into use. Since they take very good care of their things, I have to assume it was poor/cheap design, in spite of it being pretty."
1,Horrible.,"I was diagnosed with celiac disease recently, and decided to adventure into gluten free alternatives to all my favorite foods I'm not able to eat any more. I bought this bread with much excitement thinking that just maybe I had found something on the shelf that I could enjoy with gf soups, and pastas, or to just make a sandwich. I took one bite and it was all I could do not to spit it back out. Now in the bread's defense I have not tried it toasted like some are suggesting, so perhaps that may have helped some with the texture, but I can't see how it could help the bitter flavor. One bite and the bread turned into a sour/bitter powder in my mouth, that lingered long after I had swallowed the mouthful of ""bread"". Long story short, i'm not a fan, and will not purchase this again. I have since bought a couple of mixes I'm excited to try. We'll see how that goes."
1,don't buy it,"This stuff is awful and does not deserve a 1 star rating. I tried it once and threw the entire order of 6 loafs into the trash. I'll stick to baking my own gluten free bread with Gluten Free Pantry's ""favorite sandwich bread mix"". This is the only edible product I have found for making gluten free sandwich bread...."
1,"terrible texture, absence of taste","I purchased this bread for my child after a recent diagnosis of wheat allergy. She was used to hearty, whole-grain bread and could not manage to choke down one sandwich made from this stuff. Given the ingredients, I was not expecting Wonder Bread but I was hoping for something edible.I tried some and it had the dry, crumbly texture of Styrofoam packing material and less taste than a plain rice cake. Toasting it improved the texture somewhat but my child still did not like it at all.I am going to use the remaining loaves to replace breadcrumbs in certain recipes but I would caution against buying this product for sandwiches unless you've tasted a loaf from a local grocery store."
5,Best gluten-free bread for FRENCH TOAST,"I've been on the gluten free diet for 4 years. Tasted tons of breads and thrown away many of them. This bread is light and fluffy - perfect for french toast. It is the first and only bread I have found that makes great french toast. Leave the bread in the egg longer than you would traditional gluten containing bread - I soak it for a couple minutes. It is amazing! The bread itself is very bland. I can understand how someone new to the diet, trying to find a good bread for sandwiches would be very disappointed. But, the texture is ideal for french toast or garlic bread."
3,prize in the package,"I think this is my third or fourth case of Ener-G bread from Amazon but something new happened today.When it arrives I usually put the loaves in the freezer w/in 24 hrs. I just now pulled a bag out of the freezer, removed the white tab and dumped the loaf on the table. The tapioca bread is wrapped with an air tight inner wrapper and an outer plastic bag. Not only did the loaf slide out of the bag but so did some kind of insect larvae. As I went back the freezer to check the other bags I noticed the outer bags had little holes punched in them on purpose. I suppose so the outer bags won't pop or will box up more easily. I'm guessing this is how the little guy got in but still.. kind of gross. I'm not so ""bugged"" that I won't eat the bread since it was still protected by the inner wrapper but I thought I would mention it."
2,Texture Issues,This gluten free bread just does not hold up. You have to eat the sandwich immediately or it just turns to mush!
3,GF Bread,This bread is not bad and does not have as many cal. as alot of GF stuff does. better if you toast it.
3,Decent Enough,"I bought a case of this hoping it would be good enough to hold meat and cheese together. And it is. It reminds me of light rye. The texture could be worse, as could the flavor. And it's small, but not as small as some of the breads I've been buying, so at least it's the size of a cheese slice. Those are the positive points.However, I pulled out the second loaf from my case and was startled to find that it was covered in various colors of MOLD. Dark on one side and bright green (and eating away at the bread itself) on the other side. Just disgusting, but also disappointing for something that claims to last a whole year unopened. And a waste of money. I'm not even sure what I should do with this unopened, moldy loaf, but I'll probably just toss it and consider it a loss."
1,disappointment,"While glad to have gluten-free bread, was more than disappointed with the size of the loaf...too small plus it was devoid of flavor. I froze 5 loaves for making french toast sometime this year!"
1,Don't waste your money,"This bread has a heavy, unpleasant taste. If I could afford to waste food, I would never have finished the loaf. Light Brown Rice Bread by this company is MUCH more palatable!"
1,Stinky Bread,I am not happy with this bread....it tastes horrible & the smell is weird....it smells like sour milk..i called the phone number listed on the back of the packaging and the woman that answered the phone i spoke with said that the bread was not suppose to have an odor....said to return the bread where i purchased it from...i explained to her that i had also purchased the brown rice loaf and it did not have a smell to it....she said it was probably sour despite the expiration date was on July2013....i do believe that i will invest in a bread maker and make my own bread...i will not pay people money for horrible products...by the way i was force to rate the product i give it zero stars but it wasn't an option for that so i had to give the product one star but they are not deserving of that
3,Better off buying at the store,"We didn't have a problem with the service on this item - none of the loaves were moldy or anything and the product arrived quickly and with no issues. The loaves, however, were much smaller than the ones you buy at the store and were a weird shape... almost like these were the reject loaves. Since then we have been buying the loaves at a local store and they are a good size and actually look like bread. As a gluten free option this bread is very good, you can toast it and also make sandwiches and french toast. At times the price here isn't any better than what you can get these loaves for at the store, so I recommend doing that (or even paying a little more for a good loaf) if it is an option."
5,Simply Marvelous,"This bread really is wonderful. The first time I got it I thought it was horrid, but then I read the suggestions on the back. When microwaved for 30 seconds, or toasted, this is definitely the best sandwich bread out there. It tastes like normal bread, toasts like normal bread, and when unopened stores for ages. I'm a college student, and I just order a box of six packages off amazon and I'm good for at least two months. I love it!"
5,Southern Climate,"I loved this diary of the south-eastern climate. Not having ever visited the South or the East, I was very taken and involved with Ms. Simms details of her natural clime. Being an amateur poet/philosopher myself, I also enjoyed her humorous take on things and the wonderful quotes she included in this work. Since so few of us get the luxury of meditating amongst ""all the little live things"" for a day, not to mention a year, I invite everyone to become an armchair naturalist like I was, and read this book!"
5,Bat Glasses,"They were the perfect touch to my Halloween costume! I had the outfit and the cape, but I didn't look complete until I put on the glasses."
2,Small,"they are good but little small, they are more for girls than for an adult, but even that i use them"
4,Bulky but durable,"First impression is that it's a bit bulkier than the kind found at stores, but it has worked well for my overseas trips so far. Remember that this is an electronics item, so the shipping rates are a bit more expensive than say CDs, but with the low price here, it still can't be beat. Additional notes: made in China and Lifetime Warranty. I'm very happy with this purchase."
5,Great fit and quality,"The Heatshield sunshade fits my 2011 CR-V perfectly. It is very lightweight but stiff enough so that I don't have to fold down the sunvisors in order to hold it in place. Since the CR-V windshield is quite large, the sunshade itself also feels very big, thereby making it slightly cumbersome to roll up and put away. You have to take a little time to roll it up quite tightly since the built in Velcro strap isn't long enough to go around the shield if you just ""loosely"" roll it up. Usually when I'm in a hurry, I would just throw it unrolled into the back seat.But in all, a great product that is very reasonably priced and well-made."
5,Great product!,This sunshade fit my daughter's Honda CR-V perfectly and she stated inreally does keep the vehicle comfortable. We highly recommend theproduct!
4,Perfect sunshade for honda crv,"This windshield sunshade gave a perfect fit to my 2010 Honda CR-V model. It just fits very well and blocks sunlight very effeciently. One thing I experienced was, unlike other folks reviewed, it was not very easy to roll it down. Since the sunshade is not flexible (actually, it is very rigid) and is not folded, it is not so easy for me to roll back to tie. Also, it seems to be expensive.However, I am pretty satisfied with this custom-fit sunshade. I tried to buy a sunshade from auto accessary stores, but I could not find a good one for my car. I could not find this custom-fit sunshade at Amazon in February this year, but when I visited back in April I found it available. So I bought it and am happy with it."
5,Fits perfectly,"I was unsure whether paying more for a fitted shield would be worth it, but definitely is."
4,A Near-Perfect Gift,"Personally, I could go an awfully long time between concentrated listenings to an album of a cappella pop music. Having seen the Coats live, though, this album was more attractive than most. I purchased it, however, as a gift, and the recipient really loves the album. The Coats' blend, intonation, rhythmic work, and arrangements are quite good and suggest that the group should be better known than they are. If you are a fan of this genre, this would be an excellent purchase."
5,TV THOMPSON: RECOMMENDED READING,"I read TV Thompson over 25 years ago and it was a fantastic book with a wonderful message; Even though the events in the book could never happen, I understood that there are better things to do than to watch TV. I laughed at the humor, but picked up the real message. I am now trying to find this book..........definitely worth buying for my children!"
4,good mix,"Lately i have been listening to a lot of trance and buying up cds like crazy. Today i baught this cd and really enjoyed it. I have heard many good things about Nice Warren and not so much about Danny Howells but overall i thought howells delivered a better set than Warren. The mixing is awsome but some of the songs arnt that strong. I really love MOS stuff and these beats seem to be more underground and remind me of Digital Underground stuff. Overall i am happy i got this cd but i would recomend others like pete tongs essential mixes and any of the MOS annuals or trance nation cd's if you are willing to pay the price. This is a good cd to get to mix it up from the mainstreem stuff. I think I am going to enjoy listening to this cd for a very long time, and i think you would too"
4,Great for any child that loves Blue's Clues,My Grandson loves to pretend he is Steve or Joe - this let's him be in the video and he loves to look at himself. I think he is going to be a great Actor.
1,"cordless ""wall"" phone","this is the most stupid phone design, along with the other, ""both"" wall and desk mountable. they tell you it is wall mountable. yes, if you don't mind having a 25 foot jack cord along with electrical cord hanging from it. there is only one size jack cord. they usually have 2 cords, a 5"" for the wall mount, and then a long one for use as a desk phone. not these, just a desk cord, without an area to wrap it to hid the long cord. so it has to just hang from the kitchen wall. not well thought out."
4,Just what i was looking for,"Thanks, Just what i was looking for, was in good cond. and was packed great, had trouble config. the ip but was the factory fault they did not remove or reset the cards data, but it is now working great. Thanks again!!"
5,Well-made but 100% polyester!,"Nice quality but tightly woven poly pant is designed to keep out cold and wind, presumably while riding in a Jeep."
5,No more nightmares,"Recommend using these with the ""Grid Clip Put-er Up-Er."" Was able to hang three banners in a snap with Ceiling Hangers and the ""Put-er Up-er"". I will be ordering a bunch more of these.Hanging things here is a nightmare job with our 14' high ceiling. Have to wait for the BIG ladder to be delivered and get someone else to go up to the top rungs (because I am a wimp!) to place the clips and then hand things up to them only to have to move the clips etc... - no more nightmares."
3,"Great pictures, but not a lot of meat","As a diehard NASCAR fan, I bought this book mainly for the pictures, and I wasn't disappointed. There are some great shots, especially of the early days of the sport. However, I found that the accompanying text wasn't as informative as I would like; the content defintiely seems to have been filtered by the ""NASCAR censors,"" as there is nothing controversial or that could possibly be interpreted as negative about the sport. I recommend Monte Dutton's AT SPEED: Up Close and Personal with the People Places and Fans of NASCAR if you are looking for a real, true, warts-and-all view of America's favorite sport. However, Mike Hembree's book makes a pretty coffee table decoration, and is a nice tribute at the beginning of a milennium."
3,The First Sir Percy,"This prequel to Baroness Orzcy's Scarlet Pimpernel series interested me for I love that series. I would seriously suggest to read at least the Scarlet Pimpernel and Eldorado first. The story follows Sir Percy's father or great grandfather in an adventure that starts his wedding day and takes him far away from his bride and her traitorous brother. The novel mainly follows the acts of the brother, Nicholaus, as he becomes more and more corrupt. His feelings are very detailed and his character is thoroughly analyzed. Gilda is obviously just a clone of Marguerrite, and Sir Percy is never much like the man that will be named after him. All in all a good read but I would not suggest this be the first book you buy or read in the series."
5,"The best I've read for a long, long time!","Decidedly unusual and refreshing. The development of characters is fascinating; it's full of things to make you smile and things to make you think. You may think you have figured out what the ending will be, but this is also full of surprises. I thoroughly enjoyed it ... enough to order two more copies to send to friends. Bravo to the authors -- and encore!"
1,not good marker,ok lets start this marker is one of the worst markers i have ever fired not only is it heavy but it goes down wards when u shoot and half the time the balls dont break when you shoot!! if i were you id get a better marker than this also this is such a rip off i can buy this gun for 40 bucks of someone
3,"Information backed by adequate research, but no recipes!","I found this book to be very intriguing and for the most part helpful. However, Dr. Arnot has lots of research and suggestions, but he never formulates a plan. The title is misleading. There is no diet in this book. The inadequacy of the American diet is incredible and Arnot does a good job of laying this out in comparison to Asian and Meditteranean cultures -- but where are the recipes? How does Dr. Arnot expect us to change our eating habits without giving us a jumping off point? I was gravely disappointed to read the entire book and not find recipes. He should offer a book of recipes to those who were left hanging..."
3,Be Aware of Dissenting Opinions to this book's contents,"As someone who lost my mother to breast cancer, and whose sister survived aggressive (bone marrow transplant) treatment for it, I have a deep interest in anything that could help me avoid this hideous disease. I read this book (from my local library) the day he was on Oprah and later purchased it. I have begun following some of the more moderate recommendations. A lot in this book makes sense to me based on knowledge gained from much research in books and popular media.However, after having bought this book, I became aware of the fact that the American Council on Science and Health has strongly criticized this book, to the degree of writing a position paper which can be accessed on the web atI would suggest reading the ACSH paper and getting this book from your local library before purchasing it and implementing Arnot's ideas. Whatever your decision, make it with as much information as possible."
2,I found it disappointing as a survivor of breast cancer.,"At first I was excited by this book. The recommendations for diet changes and hope for help for all women were exciting. However, when I got to the chapter for women who have already had breast cancer, I was very disappointed. It basically said forget everything else you have read so far...it's not necessarily meant for you. So I would not recommend this book for breast cancer survivors...and feel it is only perhaps worthwhile for very young women. Clearly, if diet is a strong factor, then it is most important in the early stages of life."
4,"Fine research, but needs to be updated","If you want to drastically reduce your risk of breast cancer, lots of information in this book will help you. For example, consume more fiber and more vegetables. Eschew alcohol. But, this book is now 12 years old and new research is available. Please ask Dr. Arnot to update his book with current research."
3,Food is good medicine,"My mother passed away at 69 from a 2nd round of breast cancer that spread throughout her body. Her mother, my grandmother, lived to almost 89 and died of natural causes. What was the difference? My Greek grandmother had a diet rich in olive oil, fish, homegrown herbs and vegetables. My Mom kept dieting, hated exercise, and even eliminated protein from her diet (including fish), and she also developed osteoporosis. We have so many environmental factors that we can't control, so it really makes sense to be good to yourself with your diet. I'm for a mediterranean diet that includes organic fresh food. My Greek grandfather lived to 102, and so did his mother, my great-grandmother."
1,I have breast cancer,I remember watching Dr. Bob on the Oprah show and I was hopeful because my diet and exercise routine (in addition to the suppliments I take) closely matched his anti-breast cancer book. I managed stress. I wasn't in a high-risk group.Well...I'm getting ready for my second round of chemotherapy. People PLEASE DON'T BE FOOLED. Anyone is at risk and there isn't much you can do to stop this horrible disease before it hits you.
1,Get the facts first,"This book wrongly suggests diet can prevent breast cancer. As was mentioned in the New York Times' article describing the scandle surrounding this book, Bob Arnot has been asked to retract much of the scientific information he stated. There's no scientific data linking diet and breast cancer"
1,"""How To Make Money off Cancer Patients""","should be the title of this book. There is NO data backing up Arnot's ridiculous diets. There is also no link between diet and breast cancer. I found it diappointing and, as other reviewers mentioned, overtly oportunitstic."
4,A good book advocating a healthy diet,"Honestly, I don't understand what all the controversey is about. This is an extremely well-written book advocating a nutritious, low-fat diet. Dr. Arnot never once claims that this diet is guaranteed to prevent breat cancer. He admits that someone could do everything right and still get this disease. But his recommendations MAY help, and WON'T HURT anyone. Anyone who has done a lot of reading about nutrition will have heard most of these recommendations before: choose whole grains over white flour; eat less fat; increase the amount of soy in the diet... I highly recommend this book."
3,"An important word on the ""American Council for Science and Health""","I have not read Arnot's book. However, to those reviewers who cite the attacks made against the book by the American Council for Science and Health, you need to know the shaky credentials and corporate sponsorship of that particular organization. Go to their website: there you will find articles saying that pesticide in foods poses absolutely no health risks, and articles saying that vending machines in schools should be allowed to continue selling soda and a whole range of snack foods in the interests of a free market system. This Council appears to be nothing more than a highly-financed mouthpiece for various corporate interests. I have been highly skeptical of any of their ""scientific"" claims for a while now. Finding out that they do not support Arno's book actually makes me more interested in checking it out myself, so I have ordered a copy."
1,Tabloid Quality,"I agree with the criticism that the American Counsil on Science and Health wrote in complete dismissal of this book's shoddy research. The book is a horror. There is no link between diet and breast cancer. See your doctor, get check ups, do self-breast exams AND STAY AWAY from this book. Shame on Arnot."
1,I view this book as harmful,"I too STRONGLY feel one should read the American Council on Science and Health critique of this awful, misleading book. Breast cancer hits all types of women and it a FALSE assertion to suggest food has ANY impact on breast cancer. The kind of assertions in Arnot's trashy book can lead to a false hope about decreasing breast cancer risk which may cause women to defer or avoid established screening techniques such as breast self-examination or mammography. It is exploitive on Arnot's behalf, and I urge women to get breast exams and, if they are over fifty, to get mammographies. Get the facts and don't buy this book."
5,"Extra room, extra elegance!","We LOVE this shower curtain rod - we have it in brushed nickel with nickel plated curtain rings, and the look is stunning. It adds a classy dimension to our remodeled bathroom; and the bonus is all the extra elbow room you have while taking a shower in the bath! Highly recommend this product. Well made and carefully shipped."
4,U.S. Robotics 56K PCI Faxmodem,"I ordered the internal fax modem curcuit board from Amazon, which was delivered in a timley manner. Installed modem in computer and although it didn't function correctly in the first PCI slot I pluged it into it worked fine in the second one and have had no problems with it's performace to date. I am well pleased with the good price offered by Amazon as well as the quality of the U.S. Robotics PCI Faxmodem.Sincerely, Emory Crum"
1,Wrong shipment,The wrong book was shipped. The book that was delivered was an altogether wrong ISB number and was the teacher's edition for Oklahoma.
2,"A bit gruelling at times, even for a fan.","Bad start- horns honking, blaring rather. Some bad gags about fat. Finlayson wasted as a doctor in a dumb set piece featuring a prostrate Oliver. We have a wanted criminal threatening the boys with a gun, then follows the sad spectacle of their eating a meal of rubbish that was intended for the bad guy. Where is the grace and light that usually fills their films? The gentle saga of two innocents at the mercy of a harsh world? We have started here to witness the deterioration of the L&H opus, perhaps to be laid partly at the feet of director Gordon Douglas. But as they always had control of their own material, we must lay some of it before Stan and Ollie themselves. And it hurts! So, an okay comedy for those who demand little, maybe. Hard work for this lifelong fan, though, when there are so many other, far better L&H comedies available!"
5,HILARIOUS!!!!!!,"Always one of my favorite Stan&Ollie; Films, this one will make you laugh like crazy.The hornfactory is funny and Ollie's ""recovery"" from his nervous breakdown in Bed that turns out to be a disaster is funny beyond belief.But what really tops these performances is the scene where Stan has to eat the meal he made himself out of some unsavory objects (yes, objects. Such as a sponge)...without muttering a single word he get's his feelings across to the camera like a master of comedy. It is priceless.I grew up watching Laurel&Hardy; in germany (i am 38 years old) and i am glad to see that they are still cherished by people.In Germany Laurel and Hardy are known as ""Dick und doof"", which translated means ""fat (ollie) and stupid(stan)"". I guess they get right to the point.Laurel and Hardy are still going strong!!!"
4,"Stan and Ollie's Farewell to the ""Lot of Fun""","Though ""Saps at Sea"" (1940) looks like a pair of three-reel comedies stuck together, the result is undiluted Laurel and Hardy. This streamlined feature marked Stan and Ollie's last production for Hal Roach, with The Boys making the most out of thin material. Memorable appearances by Jimmy Finlayson, Rychard Cramer and Ben Turpin add to the fun. Superior to the team's mostly dispiriting post-Roach efforts."
1,bad product,"This light is poorly made and it doesn't work. It seems to be a regular light bulb with the blue layer painted on, after few weeks light chips from the heat. My plants didn't like the bulb started showing alot of brown leafs. Bad product, cant' believe GE would sell this."
1,Almost False Advertising,"This is not actually a grow light. The product specs say that this light is tinted blue to make plants ""appear"" greener and healthier. Lame."
4,Good Quality,"I have used the bulbs every day for three months and have not had a problem. More than once, my son (age three) has moved the lamps around roughly and the bulbs did not break. I am very pleased with that."
5,History lives in these novels,"In his second book of the Nathaniel Drinkwater series, Richard Woodman continues to show his ability to communicate the events of the time in an interesting and somewhat suspenseful way. Nathaniel Drinkwater is second in command on the Royal Navy cutter Kestral which seems to keep finding itself in harm's way as the winds of war blow across Europe in the late 1790's. Those of us who grew up reading about the adventures of Captain Horatio Hornblower are returned to the days of sail again. You can feel the wind and smell the salt air as Drinkwater's adventures continue. Good stuff."
3,Oldie but goodie,"This is a good recording but I wish someone would record a new one with up to date equipment,"
4,Great Archaeology Project,"This was a really fun project to enhance our homeschool study of archaeology. It definately proved that my kids won't have the patience to be archaeologists, but they had fun and learned quite a bit from this well made kit."
3,Not my cup of tea.,"The story is probably excellent for its genre, but I'm prejudiced against Gothic Romances (I usually prefer a touch of comedy). Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews online before buying it. To be fair, the story is really dark, scary & spooky--if you love that kind of stuff. The suspense will just kill you--it's too much."
5,One of Ms. Mckinney's Best Books,"This book answers why I am Ms. Mckinney's fan. Some of her books, especially this one, have class. Unlike some romances the vulgarity of which repel me, most of Ms. Mckinney's books have subtlety. I especially adore her feminine and loyal heroines and am delighted that Ms. Mckinney chooses very interesting and sohpicated period and environment as the setting of her books. Ms. Mckinney, you are recently venturing into mainstream romances, but please write more superb historical romances like this one!"
5,Shade that TRULY works.,"SUNSHADE has created a product that is true-to-form, function, and ease of use. The product fits the windshield, easy to roll&store, keeps the vehicle from becoming BLAZING hot and save the interior from drying out."
4,Solid Spatter Shield,"This is - like most of the Oxo line - well designed and effective. I have one, and I have another which is the most recent recommendation by Cook's Illustrated: a fine screen model which seems to catch less spatter than the Oxo.Because I was not satisfied with their spatter capturing I have designed my own shield and will market it sometime in 2008. I think it will merit a 5-star rating.As an aside - I return products that I think are not good. How else will a manufacturer find out about the product's faults? Returns are valuable feedback. I rarely return goods but when I do I always tell them what I didn't like, what the problem was. The better companies are grateful."
1,waste of money,"For $20 I don't even bother to return things, but this article is a disgrace, almost completely useless. Save your money."
5,Great metal cutting blades,These blades are probably some of the best blades for cutting metal with a reciprocal saw I have ever used. They outlast other brands by about 2 or 3 to 1. Even my rechargeable reciprocal saw does great cutting metal with them.
5,I LOVE IT!!!,I have never reviewed furniture before. BUT let me say that I love my Microfiber twin Futon sofa bed from Ore International.Thank you Ore for the excellent product.When I found it on Amazon the color looked more on the pink side then red. BUT I absolutely LOVE the color and the sofa!!! Plus the delivery from CEVA was exllentas well.Thank youI would shop at Ore International anytime!!!!
1,These are sunglasses for a child not for an adult,"I just got these sunglasses in the mail and they are tiny. They'd probably fit an 8 year old. They look really nice in the pic but I wouldn't suggest you buy them unless you have a really, REALLY small face and head. They're about 4 inches across. Not worth it, I'm returning mine today."
1,Serious audiophile? Then don't waste your money,"I just bought these about a week ago and I am about to pack them up and return them and get my money back. The sound quality is awful and the wireless reception isn't much better. If you really like listening to music, then these are not for you! You have to constantly adjust the reception to get even the most basic stereo reception. If you like the primitive sound of AM radio from an old hand-held radio, then these are for you. If, on the other hand, you like to hear the subtleties of the music you're listening to in stereo without a bunch of static then save your money and buy something else. These are horrible!"
4,Solid product,"These headphones have good range and sound quality (nothing phenomenal, but more than adequate). Would have rated it 5 stars, but for one ergonomic issue. The tuning knob on the headphone set itself (you tune it to work with the base station) is very easy to accidentally turn -- thereby knocking it out of commision. Within the first week of using them, I've already had to retune several times (only takes a few seconds, but it's annoying)."
2,Not a quality item for anyone serious!,"I'm ashamed I did not do my homework before making this purchase....After considerable fiddling with the transmitter and receiver controls, location, ect.(and believe me, I have no problem understanding the DIRECTIONS), I find these wireless headphones to be clearly INFERIOR!..Even after careful tuning, I still find that they produce ""white noise"" signal drop while situated about 10 feet away from the transmitter! Maybe acceptable for the kids bedroom stuff.....but for the serious listener..FORGET IT!"
2,REALLY annoying hissing in the background,"I was very excited to receive these headphones despite the numerous reviews complaining about a hissing in the background. Unnoticable during loud scenes however during dialogue and other scenes where there is not constant sound, the hissing is quite apparent. Might be better just to wait unto they advance wireless headphones into ghz frequencies as they have done with portable phones. They are quite comfortable for the first five minutes yet any longer they are not. They cup the ears and seal all the heat inside making them feel heavy and irritating for extended listening periods (20 minutes+)"
1,"Easily breakable headset, charging suggestion","I'm not brutal with equipment, but in a few short weeks, the flimsy plastic part that holds the ear pieces to the headset broke on one side. Within a month or two the other side went as well forcing me to use office paper clamps to hold the whole thing together.I use them in bed late at night when the household is asleep. A second convenient bedside charger would be nice. I tend to put them down on the bedside table before I doze off rather than get up and walk across the room hook it up for recharge. If you're a late night TV watcher, you too might call this justifiable laziness. Too many times I put them on the next night and find the battery's down.I honestly think that before I replace them with another wireless, I'd find a way to sneak an extension wire across the room through attic or basement space and go with a standard wired headphone."
1,Really annoying headphones,"I am really cheesed off with buying these headphones, the sound quality is terrible and depending on which way you turn your head, the reception changes and it sounds like a radio which not tuned in properly. Normally I would not be bothered in writing a review, but this has been such a waste of money. Take my advice give these a miss."
5,Great product and sound for the money,"I have purchased the advent770 and very happy with them.All those who gave these headphones a low rating,it because you didn't understand the directions.First and most important is the the sound source must be received through the line output and not the headphone output of your stereo receiver.And second,is the 2 tumbwheel adjustments behind the wireless receiver must be properly set before any other adjusments on the headphones.Read the directions a couple of times and you be at your neighbor's house listening to music from your house!"
3,"OK for TV, not hi-fi though",I really like these for watching my TV.I don't use them too much for music though.Distortion and signal interference is a little too distracting.
4,a great product for first time wireless users,I bought theses wireless headphones because I wanted to be able to walk around my room without the constraint of a wire and still be able to hear my music. These headphone have allowed me to do that. I think they are impressive with only a few drawbacks. The clarity at high volumes is a little distorted but that is to be expected with a wireless device. I walked around my buidling to test the range and at about 100 feet I started getting distortion and loosing the signal but I was expecting that. I live next to a airfield so there are a lot of competing signals and there are a lot of cordless phones in my area but so far everything is good. I believe I got my money's worth for my first pair of wireless headphones.
2,This didn't work well in my home,"The headphones have too much static for use in my home. I ended up buying a set of wired headphones (Sennheiser eH2200) which work great. I suspect the problem may be caused by interference by our two 900Mhz spread spectrum cordless phones, but that's just an educated guess."
3,Short Range Hinders Performance,"This product is almost useless to me because of the VERY limited range. In the same room as the transmitter it works fine, but I bought them so that I could move outside of my room. The product is lightwieght and very comfortable. If you plan to use it in the same room as the transmitter it is a must buy, but otherwise you would be better off saving your money. All in all it is a good high quality product. If the transmitter were a little stronger then it would be much better."
3,Ugh...,"Well... I am a big audio fan, and I love to hear things sounding great... but these are a big pain and a big hassle. I am an avid counter-strike player, and to wear these for hours frankly hurts. It squeezes my head, so if you have a larger head, don't buy these, find another product. Also, I find myself tuning thses a lot because the frequencys get weird sometimes. My one last problem with these are that they make awkward beeping noises during regular use, and also get distorted at loud sound levels. You are better off getting another product."
2,flaky,"These worked fairly well for a day, then inexplicably failed (wouldn't tune to base despite fresh batteries and shutting off every electronic device in the house) and I returned them when directed to do so by Advent Tech Support."
4,Filled the bill for me,"Pros: Being somewhat hearing impaired, these filled the bill. No more enertaining the ""neighbors"" with the TV volume at excessive levels. I am able to set my volume level while company with normal hearing can use the TV volume to set theirs.Cons: Performance of the system is directly proportional to the remaining charge on the batteries.Shortly after receipt, I had to take the control side apart to clean the volume control (excessive static when adjusting). OK at this time."
4,"Great sound, hard to tune!","I was very upset after I first got these hooked up. Tried and tried to get them to tune in to no avail. After many expletives and a hissy fit or two, I managed to stumble into the right tuning and was amazed at the clean sound and range. I plug into my pc for my mp3's, digital box for music and news channels while working in yard or lifting weights out in the garage 100 feet away and through 3 walls! I recommend these. Just be patient untill you tune it in right."
1,Wasted Money,"This has been my worst purchase since the click and pop machines for the old LP's. Trust me. They are very heavy and not comfortable for any length of time. You have to constantly adjust the transmitter when you change environments. CD to Movies, etc. and this is no small chore. It takes forever. Trust me. I also own the Advent wireless speaker. Only because I didn't want to drill holes in the wall or run wire all over the place. Save your money on the Advent purchase. They are not the same company they once were."
2,Pass on these,"I recently purchased these headphones and have not been impressed. The sound is okay at best. I would recommend the Sennheiser RS40 over these headphones. They cost the same, sound better and recharge on the base stand. A much better value overall."
4,"Sounds fairly good, lightweight, not bad.","Simple to install, and sounds fairly good. Range is adequate for my modest tract home & yard (which never takes me more than 200 feet from the base.) I sometimes get a little static when I sit back in the easy chair (metal springs?) I was used to a heavier closed headset, so I was pleased with the lighter weight of this closed headphone.I was mostly interested in isolation from unwanted background noise while watching TV or listening to CDs. The closed earpieces provide just acceptable isolation from outside noise.The built-in nicad recharger is a little slow (needs 12+ hours to lay in a full charge), but assuming you only need them 6 hours a day, it should suffice."
2,"Decent sound for music, poor for talk","I had to return these phones as they were essentially unusable for spoken words. I use headphones on the computer for both music listening and internet phone calls. Music sounded okay, although there was some detectable hissing. However, talk (or anything with silent patches) was very choppy. You could make out what was being said, but it made extended calls somewhat aggravating.On the plus side, the phones were very comfortable."
4,Nothing wrong with these at all...,"Fine sound, good reception over a decent range (looks like I can get around the yard without them making any big complaints), comfortable.I would say that the fidelity is only slightly less than the earbuds I'm used to. And the separation is better than I expected. There is a fair amount of hiss if no music is on, but I'm pretty picky and I think its totally tolerable."
3,The best of a poor class of products,"Why is it so complicated to make a wireless headphone that you just plug into the back of your TV (or audio receiver) and you are ready to go? Why do I need to adjust the frequency fine tuning on the headphones every time I use them? (I don't have to adjust my cordless telephone every time I use it.)Why do I need to turn the volume up all the way on the TV to match the gain to the amplifier in the transceiver (why is there not a knob on the transceiver to match the gain on the TV?).Well, after the the griping, after trying similarly priced phones from Sony and Jensen, these are the clear winners of a horrible batch. Someday, someone will come out with a well designed product that will make all the others obsolete."
2,Not very good.,"The screws that you use to tight the microphone clips are made in a weird way that you can only tighten the clip in a certain orientation, and it is a pain to mess around with it until you get your desired orientation. The side bars are not that secure.It should cost half the current price if not less for it to be a decent value."
4,"Pretty Handy, Doesnt work well with all Mic Clips","Works well most times on 5.The mic clip that you have will determine how effective this bar will beGet mic clips with metal screws, plastic screws will be easily destroyed."
2,"Cheap, but also feels that way","I bought two of these bars. I have had many problems with them. They are very hard to tighten at an angle - in fact impossible to do without pliers. Also, some mikes can only be attached to certain posts - the knobs at the bottom will not tighten to the bar. I would not recommend this bar.On the other hand, the price was about the same as it would cost me to ship back, and thus I didn't return them.I would recommend using a sturdier stereo bar.Update:After I removed one of the mikes, the side bars have now bent. They are not as thick as the center bar."
4,"For the price, amazing","The Jenson headphone is high quality economicalal investment that makes a great upgrade for the inferior ones that comes with every music player. It handles bass very well, is comfortable, and has a generousely lenghted cord. Their is also a handy volume control located about 2 feet down from the earpiece that has an on/off switch as well. The over-the-head piece is made of soft robber that dosen't pull at your hair and bends nicely. The only downside, I feel, is the fact that the earpieces often do not fit copmpletely adjecent to the ear robbing you of some potencial volume. Other than that, the Jenson JM10 Headphone is the best bang-for-the-buck on the market."
5,a really solid book from the 'old school',"This well written book takes you from complete beginner all the way up through the microcosmic orbit. It is presented in an old school style - classically you did lots of simple basic practices to get your body healthy enough to start doing meditations. This book has all those basic practices and beginning meditations, and it explains some - not too much - of what you are doing and why.Other reviewers have listed all the different exercises that are in the book - there are a lot - so I'll skip that.Stephen Chang was one of the first in print in English, and this book has stood the test of time. I've been studying and practicing qigong since 1987, this is one of the best beginner books I've seen."
5,very good; designed for the Western mindset,"This book is simply fantastic. I read it some years ago. I got a mailing from some exploitative outfit, saying all the stuff this book did, I got it just to prove their claims wrong. Wow, what a book! It is written for the Western mindset, easy to understand, and packed- I do mean packed- with useful exercises. It's a good intro to Chi Kung. The million dollar point alone is worth far more than the price of the book, and I have used that exercise since I read the book. This book is roughly comparable toThe Art of Chi Kung: Making the Most of Your Vital Energy, and the books of Mantak Chia."
5,The complete system of self-healing: internal exercises,"book arrived in very good condition, was very happy with the contents, it was very informative and I have learnt a lot from it."
1,"Great concert, bad DVD","I purchased this concert on VHS years ago. It was called No Ticket Required. I recently found this DVD and saw it had radically different packaging, even the title had been changed from No Ticket Required to All Live! I noticed that all of the sleeve notes were in Portugese. The DVD had been manufactured in Manaus, Brazil. I played the DVD all of the text was in Portugese including the menu. It took me a while to figure where to go to start the concert. The concert is just like the old video. But the image and sound quality is terrible. I had to turn up the volume very high to hear anything and the image was dark and fuzzy. The part that really angered was that I paid $22 for this piece of junk. This DVD is obviously a Brazilian bootleg that has entered the American market. So, I warn all people whom are considering buying this DVD to not do so. By the VHS it will cost less, and look and sound better. If you already have the VHS keep it."
4,All Live In Phil's Prime,"Phil Collins All Live! This is a concert from Phil during his prime(1985) in Reunion Arena in Dallas, Texas. He performs some of his biggest hits from that era, ""Against All Odds"", ""In The Air Tonight"", ""You Can't Hurry Love"", ""Take Me Home"" & ""One More Night"". It's a good show, as were all of Phil's. He performs a great ""In The Air Tonight"" and the song ""Westside"" was very powerful. Any Phil Collins DVD is good...there are some that are better...if you want an introspective look at Phil and his personal life try ""A Life Less Ordinary"", if you want a slightly better concert DVD I would go with ""Serious Hits...Live!"" which also features multiple camera angles to choose from."
5,A Private Life & World History in a fascinating journal!,"Samuel Pepys was a paper pusher in the 1600's who had the fantastic luck to get a political job with the English Navy, who knew Charles II, who dined with William Pitt, who was a scamp of a philanderer (and details it all!)-- This amazing journal takes place between 1660 and 1669. It is possibly the most entertaining journal you will ever read. Imagine seeing the Great London Fire of 1666 through his eyes? Details and personalities, all here. For those of you who love history, for those who love personal journals, this is the book to read! And it's only 350 years old. You will be amazed at how forthright he is about his lust for other women than his wife, at how he chastises himself, yet still commits the same sins. He is perfectly human, this Samuel Pepys, and a delight to read!"
1,Can't tell the value of a book by its price,"I purchased this book based upon its title. Unfortunately, itdidn't deliver. The author is long on good intentions, but short ondelivering useful information. He tries to cover everything: software lifecycle, teams, process. But covers nothing in-depth. This book is more along the lines of the One Minute Manager - about as useful as taking a one minute course on C++ or calculus."
5,It's perfect for what I needed it for.,"This screen is exactly what I was hoping it would be. It's plain in appearance, but that's what I wanted. I plan to put plants in front of it to dress it up."
3,Be prepared to supplement a lot,"This book is listening, speaking and critical thinking--no more no less. The chapters are interesting generally, with lots of authentic listening material and discussion topics--music, art, dreams, work, the nature of intelligence, etc. But there's no grammar--I actually had a student ask me to add grammar exercises to each unit! And no writing, little reading. Plus by now it's dated. You'll have to add a lot if you're doing a general high level course, as I am. In the future, I'm sure I'll use some of the listenings to supplement other course books, but on its own this coursebook is quite narrow."
4,Really awesome,"You know what...this CD rocks. It's funny. If you weren't expecting funny, then you're some kind of dummy because...look at the name. What band isn't trying to make you laugh that has the word WEINER in it? Forget trying. This CD is funny. It makes you smile. It's not annoying, and the guys don't try too hard. They aren't going for soulful ballads, no. But that doesn't make them bad. They sound like they're having a great time playing these songs. I'd compare them to the All-American Rejects for sound, and with the lyrics more along the lines of Blink 182 or NoFX. If you have a sense of humor, then this CD belongs in your collection."
4,Solid Spy Novel!,"This book turned out to be nice surprise. Being a Robert Littell fan, the author has done a nice job of capturing the ""spy"" atmosphere that many cannot. This book is about several newly installed MI:5 field operatives who have attempts made on their lives. They flock together after the attempts and try to test the validity of the rumor of Contact Zero, a place of refuge for disassociated spies. As they follow the clandestine clues to potentially reach Contact Zero, their trust in the rumor and in each other begins to wane. Interesting book that for the most parts keeps a pretty quick tempo, not always an task for a spy novel."
3,Good Cookies.,"I loved the cookies, they're great and had a fun foreign experience, but they were very crushed from the packing."
1,not what i remember,"I love Jammie Dodgers. My Aunt in England used to send them to us all the time. She moved from England and missed them. We found them here and were so excited.NOT AT ALL what we were used to eating. Very stale and disgusting tasting. The jam was not moist at all. The date on the package was not overdue, so they should have been fresh.Didn't send them back...never tried to reconcile, or try another batch. Too much inconvenience to package them all up and send back. Just threw them out. We were disappointed.First bad experience...but will probably never buy baked goods again."
2,WELL,"NOTHING WRONG WITH COOKIES AS THEY WERE MARVELOUS.BUT SO EXPENSIVE, FOR JUST A FEW COOKIES,YIKES I AM NOT DONALD TRUMP."
1,Rancid,"I ordered 3 boxes of Jammie Dodgers (over$24) as Christmas gifts on Dec. 2, 11. They were not opened until Xmas and a week or two later. They were spoiled. They smelled off and tasted awful. The best by dates were covered up. They seemed like they were over a year old. I will never order anything from them again!"
3,The choice of Dr. Who,I'm a Yank and I had to try these after watching Dr. Who go on about these several times.. Great product placement! They are a lil dry.. it could have been the long trip from UK. I believe the Doctor would be much happier with Knotts Berry Farm Shortbread Cookies (biscuits).
3,Hound carrier,"I love the carrier but feel it runs small, my Kings is 5.5 lbs and won't fit much longer if he goes to 6 lbs. Bought the small, prob should've bought the medium. The small does not give him any wiggle room and seems small even tho he is a small dog."
4,Great talent!!!,I'm a big fan!! She has staying power. I think she'll be around for a long time. She can sing TOO!!!
5,My Sister! My Sister!!!,I am in constant awe at the depth of Jill's Talent....I wait with baited breath.....while she's at her drawing board creatin' away!!!
4,"Two for tea, and tea for two......","I had to check this album out again. After giving it a 2nd good hard listening to, I decided to give it 4 stars. Jill is in need of more showmanship however that does't take away from the solidness of this album..... This album AND Badu(LIVE)are two gems for your collection."
5,Don't miss this one!,"I never really got into Jill Scott. The first time I heard her was on ""The Roots Come Alive"". She gave an incredible performance on ""You Got Me"", that left me singing, ""My name is J-I-L-L-S-C-O-T-Teeeeeeeeeeeee!"", but still I wasn't moved to buy her first album. Even after reading the incredible reviews of ""Who Is Jill Scott?"", and hearing a couple tracks...I never bothered. I'd rather hear something with a Timbaland beat and a nasty MC.Just to check it out, I downloaded this album from my favorite IRC channel. I'm so hooked! I immediately ordered both of her CD's for myself and as a gift for a friend. Damn, it's so great to hear some real GOOD music!If you, like me, have kept putting this CD back on the shelf so you could afford to grab then new [Insert Artist Here], delay no more. You've gotta hear it to believe it."
5,Amazing,"I've never written a review before, though I'm usually interested to see what other folks have written. However, this time I'm actually going to take a moment to add my 2 cents. Whenever someone has asked me who my favourite artist is, or what my favourite CD is, etc, I've never had an answer. A musician myself, my tastes are so varied that I can never pin it down to one thing. At least, I never could in the past: as soon as I heard this CD I was blown away. It is tight AND entertaining from start to finish. Jill is just amazing poetically and musically, and her band really rises to the top as well. Kudos to Jilly from Philly and her amazing crew. I never get tired of listening to this, and I've been listening pretty regularly since I got it 2 years ago."
3,Pretty Good Soul!,"When I bought this cd I kinda had doubts because it's live and I'm not a big hip hop fan. However I did like a couple of her songs I had heard on MTV2. When I played the cd I liked it a lot! Not hip hop really at all..(thank goodness) mostly soul, and I LOVE soul!The cd is a two cd set the first cd is live tracks from her album ""Who Is Jill Scott"". She did a great performance live with those songs, kinda repetitive in spots but good.The second cd is a mix of live songs & unreleased studio tracks, it too is pretty good.I enjoyed this cd but I must say it's a cd I'll probably only play when I'm in the soul mood I'm mostly a pop rock fan but I do like soul when I am in the mood for it, and she does a great job playing it!"
5,Experience: Jill Scott 826+,"Ms. Scott is an unbelievably talented young lady, and I had the pleasure of witnessing her live performance in Florida. I was glad to see that her spirit was captured and recorded during one of her most incredible performances to date. The ""Experience"" is just that, and it should be felt by everyone."
2,Don't get too excited.,"I am a big Jill Scott fan, so do not get me wrong. The value in this two CD set in the second CD where you hear new material. The first CD is a live performance of Jill Scott's debut album and too me it's REAL CORNY! Jill's voice is cool but the music is WACK. The sound from the debut album is studio manufactured which is why it cannot be replicated live.The second CD has some good tracks on it. Personally, I am waiting for the next REAL Jill Scott album. This album is semi. If you think that you are going to get an Erykah Badu live album experience then you will be sadly disappointed.I hate to burst someone's bubble but the truth must be told."
5,"Ah, Jill Scott!","I love Jill Scott and this is really one to own. The songs are really great and her voice, ah, the voice is smooth as ever. My only problem is this: the song Golden was not included here. That was a huge disappointment for an otherwise excellent Cd."
5,Music to chill and sip wine,"Jill Scott's Live CD is great, there are so many sounds of different instruments and singing. The CD is very Mellow and you could relax, take a bath, chill and sip some wine with the one you love or simply just by yourself. I would recommend this to anyone!!!"
4,good concert all the way live,good concert jill scott does'nt get enough props as a singer has a good 70's vibe the horns reminds me of a miles davis session before his acidrock period love it fans of this should also get erykah badu live.
2,Mediocre!,I bought 4 of these speakers and I have to be honest it's a lot of static....I'd keep searching for a better product. I'm going to try the Sony one. My friend bought the SONO'S brand it's simply amazing....perfect sound in every room and a wireless remote...but expensive!
1,Buy something else or waste money!,"I have had this system and to earn 5 stars here is what needs to be fixed:1. The transmitter's wire should not break in about 9 days thus creating nasty sound. The customer service rep. said that no replacement is available. The wire is special has 3 not to wires inside!2. The sound has too much popping even with in 30 feet away from the transmitter, even more annoying at night.3. One of the speakers broke with in 1 year so much that you can barely listen to it unless at big volumes.Garbage!"
1,Transmitter will not work,"I bought this item and right out of the box the transmitter did not work. I am trying to resolve this with RCA right now.Buy another product, all I read about on the internet is the transmitter not working for many people."
1,unsatisfactory,this thing has nothing but bass coming out of it. and it even has a bass control to add more bass. i have my tv bass completely turned off and still nothing but bass. but the tv has no contols for treble or bass for the output signal.
1,Very Unhappy,I have the older model and I have gone through 2 transmitters because they eventually won't power up. The speakers are great but I can't seem to get a transmitter to last more than a few months.
