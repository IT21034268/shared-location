4,Great value,"Being a first time dog owner, I was very leery of trying to cut my dogs nails myself. But with these trimmers, it was very easy! They are very effective and very sturdy."
1,A DEVICE OF TORTURE,"We had misplaced the trimmer we've had for several years, so I ordered this one. The first time I used this on my cat's first claw, she actually yelped in agony.The explanation is simple: Look at the two photos I've loaded above, and examine the cutting head of each tool. I rubberbanded the handles on both tools closed so the cutting action can be observed.In the first photo of the older Lambert Kay trimmer (we finally found it), you'll see the two pieces of the cutting head are parallel and tight against each other. This allows for a clean cut of the claw.Now examine the second photo of the Safari trimmer: Note how the gap between the two pieces. The claw gets caught in that space, and instead of a clean cut, gets crushed.The original French guillotine was considered to be a device of terror, so this Safari trimmer is aptly named. I immediately returned this to Amazon for a refund, and I would highly suggest avoiding its purchase."
2,same old same old,"I'm not sure how many ""Complete Guides to vampires"" the world really needs. I'm pretty sure we didn't need this. Most of this stuff is available for free on the internet, or on Wikipedia or similar sites. It's pretty much a rehashing of what most people with an interest in vampire legends already know. Probably of some use to folks just developing an interest in the mythology, as it is pretty easy to follow. But there's nothing new or groundbreaking in the book."
1,horrible waste of trees,"A terrible book, written in a drunken afternoon at the library by a lazy, ignorant man. Filled with mistakes and stupidities. Save your money."
4,WOW,Ashley can really blow you away with all the information that he gives in this book. Very informative and I love reading this book!
1,Fire & Ice.,Really bad movie - bad acting and if you had expected a quality adventure movie you will get sadly disappointed.Its not even af B-movie. See it only if you are bored and have nothing else to do!
2,Fire & Ice - Dragon Chronicles,"I'm sorry to see Arnold Vosloo ofThe Mummy [Blu-ray] fame and David Rhies Davies ofIndiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Special Edition)fame come down to this B movie level. Davies has been in several barely watchable SciFi movies of late, and this won't improve his resume. The movie means well and has some decent settings that made me want to watchLadyhawkeagain, but it just doesn't quite make it as a decent fantasy. You will probably enjoy the animatedFire and Iceover this one. This makes decent background if it's on the SciFi channel, but that's about all. If you enjoyed this movie, be sure to catchDragon Wars - D-War. I think you will be far more amused than what you got out of this movie. It annoys me I can see Vosloo in this far lesser effort on DVD, but not in the Veritas TV series in which he did a great job acting.CA Luster"
4,A pretty good low budget family movie,"Fire and Ice is a well done Dragon based fairy tale. The dragons, all CGI, are unique from other movies and add well to the low budget adventure. The cast is pretty good particularly Amy Acker (Angel seasons 3-5) as a rough and tumble princess. The scrip falls a bit short when developing her bravery, as the dragon attacks the village, and when only armed with a dagger, she gets beat down pretty easily. The movie is rated PG-13 which is probably right although I don't think too many of today's pre-teens would have issues with people being incinerated by dragon's breath, or stabbed through the heart with little to no blood."
3,Not bad,"Movie wasn't the greatest but it did fill a vacancy when it comes to fantasy blurays. The movie has some confusing moments, like the projector???, but overall watchable. The presentation was good though."
4,What can I say??? Classic Series...,"You can say I've been around a bit and grew up on Degrassi Junior High,etc..Wound up watching Degrassi ""Next Generation"" kind of unintentionally...Glad I did and the rest is history.Just a tremendous cast of young actors and great stories with several different topics.Have enjoyed many of the young actors grow through their teenage years.The show keeps adding many talented young actors as the years go by.With many of the cast from 2001-2007,pretty much gone,most have been replaced.If you have been a fan of Degrassi since the 80's or just getting into the series,season 4 is definitely something you should check and add to your collection.I'm slowly adding seasons to my collection.Check the show out if you haven't yet..."
5,Degrassi: The Next Generation,The season that changed everything. Jimmy was shot. Among 20 other amazingly writing episodes.A must buy box set!!
3,"Great size, poor lid construction","The holder with the strap is great..opening is large enough to put ice in.I bought three of these for camping and school. Two of the lids have broken. When you pull out the top to drink from, the inside plastic piece breaks.I have emailed the company and they will be replacing them, per email response. I will wait to see...."
3,good for camping,This is well worth the money for $7 each plus free shipping. After using these at a day camp for my kids here are my pros and cons....Pros:1. The strap is very sturdy and adjustable2. The holder zips up and holds moisture well3. Overall a good buy for what I needed it forCons:1. The plastic bottle itself is very cheap. I wouldn't dishwasher it.2. The spout leaks some unless you wrap your lips around it.3. You don't want to wrap your lips around it because there is no cover4. The strap isn't long enough to wear it as a shoulder to waist sling
5,This is the book I have been looking for!,"As a volunteer wildlife rehabilitator who is very interested in education, I have been looking for the excellent educational book that both describes wildlife rehab and more importantly tells how to prevent the need for it. I had almost given up and started working on my own material when I found this book. It's wonderful! It has a wonderfully balanced perspective and should be fascinating reading at all ages. The pictures are excellent, showing both the uplifting and depressing sides of rehab. And very important, it describes a wide range of species in rehab in the US, from marine mammals to reptiles, and many of the facilities that care for them. Wildlife rehab is not a hobby to be taken lightly, the animals aren't pets, and this book does a brilliant job of teaching that."
4,Geat book for kids and adults who care about all animals.,"Shannon Jacobs shows her care and concern from the littlest creature to the biggest beast that suffers from the neverending battle between humankind and the animal kingdom. This book is a wonderful way to educate kids and grownups on what to do in a situation of finding hurt or orphaned wildlife, which is something that everyone comes into contact with at least once in their life. I am inspired to do whatever I can to help the cause, and Shannon's book is a BIG step in helping."
5,Great Product,"I recently bought this product but almost didn't based on the reviews.I received the product and it works great in both my digital camera and MP3 player. The size of the card is the same as the lower density cards I currently have.Besides, if they would have sent the wrong card I am sure they would have swapped it out, their customer support number is located right on the package.Highly recommended"
2,YUCK,"The characterization is not plausible in the least, and the technique of narration in the third person present tense is annoying. Obviously this book was not edited to the standards of printed media. I couldn't make it past the first couple of chapters before I requested a return and refund. The two star rating is generous."
4,Afair read,"Being a Stephen Hunter and Tom Clancy fan I rate this book 4 stars because of some of the vague comments about shooting and snipers. Being a competitor in shooting sports myself I look for more detail on the subject.The story line was OK but the term ""Cristal"" was overused."
3,Good,It had some action and suspense. It kept me interested in the plot and the characters. The ending was a surprise!!!
4,Cajun Sniper,"This book was easy reading, action packed and just offered a fun read. The story seemed realistic and the facts about the weapons and sniper tatics added to the enjoyment."
2,"Good idea, pity about the execution","This is from the iUniverse stable of assisted and/or self published books. Whilst the author may have some assistance in creating the book there was apparently no assistance with the spelling. I would have thought that correct spelling was a fundamental and that writing style could be partially overlooked because of content. It is a good story and one could imagine a an action packed movie.As it stands, twenty dollars is too much to pay. I would reccomend Stephen Hunter and of course, ""Unintended Consequences"" by John Ross."
1,"All things considered, a DUD, save your money!!","I'm with the one and two star reviewers, this is simply a bad job of writing, editing, grammar, context and lord knows how many other negative attributes. I guess I let my satisfaction with Stephen Hunters books get the better of me, there is no way this man will ever be a Hunter. Please save your money for someone who the publishing world will accept and print. This dog won't hunt."
3,Technically Sound,"Good story, poor editing. Misspelled words throughout the book. Words left out of sentences. Sorely in need of proof reading."
5,Great!,This is the second one of these baby books I have gotten. The first I got for my first child and I loved it so much I got the identical one for my second child. It has everything I was looking for to record throughout my kids' early years! I love it!
5,Very versatile book!,"This is the best baby book I've ever used. I only wish I had found it before my fourth child! It is very comprehensive and not overly decorated. I have personalized my son's with scrapbooking stickers, etc. that represent him. One reviewer said that there is so much info that she had to return it because she'd feel guilty about not completing it - maybe some therapy would help - but she could just ignore what is printed on the page and use it for more photos! I am ordering the school-age books for my children today!"
5,Best baby book I've ever seen,"Well organized, complete without being tedious. I give this book as gifts."
4,Not the best looking but the best detail,"My husband and I went to a bookstore to check out what was available. All the nicer looking baby books had less detail and no space for cute things your child has done that you want to remember, etc. This book, although not as good looking, offers the most detail that we saw. Some people claim they wouldn't have time/don't care to fill in so much detail. You don't have to! Fill in what you want!"
1,Not right,"Product was not what was described and not in the condition promised. It was a huge disappointment. If I could have seen it before ordering, I wouldn't have."
1,Not what I expected,"As a mother of three small children I have gone through my fair share of good and bad baby books. I bought this for my third son when he was born ""thinking' it was a binder baby book as the description states, however don't be fooled by those words as it isn't. It has one of those cheap plastic rings that you can't open and add things to (no sturdy metal rings that open here).This was very discouraging for me as I have always bbought binder baby books for my children for that exact purpose....to add photos and other extras for great memories. The cover is ugly and the book seems very cheaply made, and the pages are nothing different that what you would see in any other baby book.Take my advise and pass on this one."
2,Want a full-time job?,"This is a great baby book if you have nothing else to do but fill in every aspect of your baby's life and development. Personally, I would feel guilty if I left any sections incomplete so I had to return this book. It would be a full-time job to make sure this book was complete."
5,Excellent,"Excellent quality, durable, worth the money, would buy again. Service from seller is quick, easy, smooth transaction. We have horses, and this bucket is perfect for our needs."
4,Worth it but. . .,"I enjoyed this series when it first played on Masterpiece Theater and finally decided a year ago to try the books. After reading the first few, my husband and I began watching the videos. Here's the deal--the acting is wonderful, but the adaptation, especially in the first half of the first series, is infuriating. Many things were changed, all to make the story more melodramatic than in the books--changes that insult the viewer's intelligence. But hang with it--the adapters start to trust the original as they go, and Graham's story comes through intact. I'm not complaining on the mere basis of change--the first series covers about 1300 pages of novels, and changes had to be made. But the changes were stupid ones. . . And try the books. They are absolutely marvelous."
3,Need a DVD version!,I LOVED this story when I first watched it on PBS in the late 70's. I bought the VHS--but was somewhat disappointed withediting. A DVD of the original series (no editing) is absolutely necessary! Please!
5,Grand Historical Romance,"Poldark is an adaptation of the first four of Winston Graham's novels set in Cornwall in the late eighteenth century. This is a great story of love and loss. Ross Poldark arrives home after years in the British army in the America (How often do we Americans see a redcoat as a hero?) to find his father dead and his beloved Elizabeth engaged to his cousin Francis. Ross endures intense depression, then finds two new loves, his future wife Demelza and his copper mines. He defends both and comes close to losing both in one scheme after another. All the time his unrequited love for Elizabeth hangs over him and his family.The Poldark story is a good picture of late eighteenth century England as the old gentry, represented by the Poldarks, struggles for control against the up and coming new commercial elite, represented here by the Warleggan family. It is a grand story of romance and adventure."
2,Where's the DVD?,"The story may take place in the 18th centrury, but this is 2004 -- where's the DVD? If it were available on DVD, I'd be buying it right now, instead of writing this reveiw!I did see the series on television a couple times, and it is great fun! Great character development, and, like the soaps, there are those you love to hate and even some you hate to love."
5,Laugh-Out-Loud Funny. Hiaasen at His Best.,"Any writer who can imagine a character who hallucinates hearing 'Hey Jude' sung as a duet between Bobby Gentry and Plácido Domingo can't be ignored. This guy Hiaasen is one of the funniest writers around. I'll read anything he writes. This one, though, is one of his best. I couldn't put it down and I laughed so hard my wife thought I might have a stroke. It tells a page-turning story that involves characters that probably couldn't exist in reality, but who cares? The plot is complicated, with parallel threads running throughout, but it makes good sense and, of course, comes out right. Further, he manages to make the reader think about unfunny things like the horrible agricultural pollution of the Everglades--Hiaasen loves his swamps and their denizens, human and otherwise--without it becoming the least bit preachy.Obviously I don't have much to add to the previous 176 reviewers, but I felt I had to add my own enthusiastic endorsement.Scott Morrison"
3,Fun but Limited,"A fun romp that leans heavily on the attractiveness of heros, sex, and implausible people and situations. Witty dialogs and cartoon-like charaters are fun but a bit unsatisfying."
1,stinko,"I was looking for a fun ""summer read"", but found instead an incredibly stupid book. This book was too moronic to be humerous."
2,Don't believe all the hype,"Granted this is the first Hiassen book I've read, but I really didn't think it was that great. It starts off fast paced and good, but in my opinion the book slides downhill from beginning to end. Speaking of the end, what a major dissappointment the ending was. To think that I spent all that time wading through endless information about the Florida swamps and unrealistic happenings, just to find the very unsatisfactory ending. I was not impressed and will not read another Hiassen book, due to the fact that people are calling this his best.Dont' believe all the hype about the humor. I believe thaere was one time where I actually chuckled to myself, but other than that I consider this book a waste of time.Then ending reminded me of a bad television show that ending with.............""To be condluded next week."""
1,I don't get it,"How?! How can so many readers and critics find this book ""entertaining and funny""? This was my first book by Carl Hiaasen, and it started out pretty good for this reader, but then the story and characters went to cartoon-land (hence the jacket cover)and left me dazed and confused as to what is supposed to be a good book these days.Prior to reading ""Skinny dip"" I had just re-read ""Catcher in the Rye"" which I DID find ""funny"" and ""entertaining"" (gentle steer), so maybe I was a little jaded, expecting a little too much from a modern day best seller."
1,Skinny Dip,"I never thought I would like fiction - - now I'm certain of it.About three quarters of the way through the book, I put it on the shelf - - never to be picked-up again. I should add that whatever it is that the author wanted to say - - it is extremely well-written."
4,"funny, but for adults only","This book is hilarious but extremely raunchy, so don't buy it for your kids or teens."
5,Rollicking fun,"""Skinny Dip"" is another entry into Hiaasen's theater of the absurd, with its usual cast of colorful characters and ridiculous twists to the plot that remind you there are far more idiots in this world than those with common sense. There are cameos from previous books, such as Mick and Captain, but enough new personalities - and fresh digs into political corruption - to make this entertaining and enjoyable. It's laugh out loud funny with enough feel good emotions to counter the darker motivations. I loved Joey and Mick, as well as the fascinating Tool. There isn't a single miss in the cast of this offbeat work. My only complaint was the rather blunt and enigmatic ending.Still, you can't go wrong with this one for wacked out, plotty fun."
5,Great Read !,"I purchased Skinny Dip on audio CD and listened to it in the car on the way to work. A fast moving and often funny book. Laughed outloud at some of the machinations of some of the characters. Can't wait to ""read"" some of Carl Hiaaen's other books."
4,Fantastic,I loved this book. It was so funny. Witty and smart.All of the characters including the not-so-likeable ones were great. They were so colorfully described. This was my first Hiaasen book and it was probably the best book I've read in a long time. I'm sold. I'm picking up other titles by this author.
4,Revenge with a capital R,"This was my first--and definitely not my last--Hiassen novel. The author manages to adroitly combine crime gone wrong with hilarity and ecology, namely the protection of Florida's Everglades; and he does it with élan and ribald humor. From Joey Perrone's narcissistic husband, Chaz, flipping her overboard a luxury cruise liner to the apelike Earl Edward O'Toole (Goon Extraordinaire) being cowed by a little blue-haired lady who supplies him with pain killers--Skinny Dip is a jewel. Well done, Mr. Hiassen. I'm headed to the bookstore for more of your reads."
4,Die Hard Hiassen Fans,"Wow! Carl did it again! Die hard fans will love the reference to the ""blue tongue vole"". Loved the return of the crazy everglades guy in the shower cap. Of course, we all know who he is. I always look forward to the next book."
3,Best suited to south Floridians,"I probably would have enjoyed this book more if I was from Florida and could identify with all of the references made to people and places in the Sunshine state. Hiaasen does a fine job of putting together a story, but I found this novel to be just that: a so-so story. It wasn't gripping enough for me. Perhaps I went in with expectations too high. I'm finding that when I read I want to get more out of a book than what I was left with here. I have the same feeling that I had after reading Baldacci's, The Winner. All in all this is an okay ""light read"", and I say go for it if you're from south Florida. Otherwise, think twice if you want more than ""fluff""."
3,A little hokey - but entertaining,My first Carl Hiaasen read... I wasn't familiar with his style and couldn't decide if he reminded me of John Grisham or a screenwriter for the Lifetime Channel movies. I did enjoy the book but there were some 'scenes' that were a little too far-fetched and unbelievable which turned me off to the interesting plot-line.
2,Surely not his best...,This was my first and possibly last Hiaasen novel. I've heard so many great things about his writing and so maybe that hype deflated me but I really just didn't see this as being very funny. The beginning starts out great - and I love how Hiaasen can be economical with his descriptions - justifying the 2 stars... but the story falls flat to me because its sooooo incredibly predictable. Not to mention - the reasoning behind such outrageous behavior by the characters is just - well - not very interesting. I know Hiaasen had a parable to play out but this platform just didnt work. At least not this time. If I see something of his on sale - I might try it.
2,SKINNY DUPED,"I am a big Carl Hiassen fan and have read nearly all his previous books, but this one left me cold. The problems are: total lack of sexual tension between two main characters, motives of Chaz the husband just too unbelievable, lack of character development and wooden dialog. Basically I just didn't care enough to read properly to the end and just skimmed the last half. I have never, repeat, never done that before with Hiassen. He is a talented individual and can write cutting dialog when he wants to but this one just seemed like churning out a book. TRY HARDER CARL!"
4,"Formulaic, but a good formula","If you've read Hiaason before, you'll know if you'll like this book before you read it. I found it funny as always, sarcastic, caustic and downright slapsticky at times. Yes, its a genre and predictable, but sometimes that can actually be a great thing: to have expectations from a writer and have them met. No disappointment for me."
4,"Not Hiaasen's best - but still, not too shabby","Hiaasen's prose and dialogue are good throughout and sometimes his piquant phrasing is outright hilarious. And, as usual, his descriptions of rural Florida are dead-on.The depth of the story and the lead character's relationship probably could have been further realized. The hero, Mick Stranahan, while deftly portrayed as an intelligent, honorablechampion, as I read, I kept straining, waiting for him to jump off the page. He was so low-key, as much as I liked him, I just wanted to slap some life into him.I think that the Amazon.com editorial review said it best.....""As much fun as Hiaasen has delivering Chaz his climactic comeuppance, what's missing from Skinny Dip is a more complex, more credible development of Mick Stranahan's character and the relationship he builds with the much younger Joey Perrone."""
5,Great Fun,"Carl Hiaasen is the true master of the funny mystery novel and this is one of his best. Great characters, a great plot and a kind of humor that's from beyond this world. What can I say except: Bravo!!! Please, more of this!!!"
3,First time Hiaasen reader,"After the first few chapters, I wondered if I should bother finishing Carl Hiaasen's Skinny Dip. There must be a reason he's so often described as ""a good read...hilarious."" Except for the offbeat ""Tool,"" the characters were not well developed, and the plot was too nonsensical. What played out in a two week time line gave the impression of having gone on for months. Not a particularly funny nor engaging book except for the redemption of its most unlikely character, Tool."
5,Hysterical,"I loved this book. The characters were fantastic, heroes and villains alike. The plot is great and fast moving. I did not want to put it down and can't wait to read his other books."
5,Laugh-out-loud Funny!,"Hiassen is a rare author who can weave a good story AND interject great humor. This is a light, easy, fun read that had me laughing out loud. Every Christmas I gift my friends my favorite read of the year and this was my choice for 2005."
3,Not a prize-winning book - but entertaining!,"Fun book - easy to read ... but not a deep thinking novel. Great for when you need something basic but good. I think that ""One for the Money"" and all the books in that series are funnier, though."
5,Women will love this feisty gal,"When Biologist Charles Perrone, suspects that his wife Joey has discovered his latest and greatest scam. He takes her on a cruise and promptly tosses her into the Atlantic Ocean. But Joey, who is a strong woman as well as a former swimming champ, makes it back to shore determined to get even with her hubby. She finds her good guy type and begins to mess with Charles's mind. Women will love this feisty gal and her revenge tactics.Reviewed by Janet Sue Terry, author of the contemporary romance, ""Set Me Free"" series Possibilities and Resolutions. President of Just My best Book Publishing Company. www.janetsueterry.com."
2,"NO BETTER OR WORSE THAN HIASSEN'S OTHER BOOKS, MORE OF THE SAME","Carl Hiassen's latest blend of satire and crime fiction is no better or worse than his previous efforts. It's basically more of the same. Same cast of loveable losers, including the noxious cad, the thug with a heart of gold and the feisty, sexy woman who is really a man's fantasy. Same loose plotting and topical environmental themes. Same overbearing, ironic humor that undermines Hiassen's occasional attempts at poignancy. The biggest problem with ""Skinny Dip"" is that it never picks up steam after a semi-interesting ""woman left for dead"" premise. The most entertaining character in this revenge fantasy is the hapless, much put-upon bad guy. The other players remain types. If you want taut, crisp crime fiction with bite, pick up any novel by Elmore Leonard or by Hiassen's fellow Floridian Charles Willeford."
3,Mediocre Murder Mystery,I was sadly unimpressed with this Hiassen novel. I have loved most of his other books. This one seemed to go on forever and the ending was terrible. I hope it is just one rotten apple in the barrel.
3,Pretty good,"All the chortling from critics found on the back cover is true, as they would be for any Hiassen novel. His stories are like a cool breeze on a hot summer day. Not deep, but satisfying. Not gripping, but fun."
4,"Fun, but no aftertaste - stick figures having fun","Hiaasen's writing is quirky and interesting. But his characters are all ""types."" Once you meet them on the opening pages, that is all you need to know. The strong-and-silent loner (lifted right off of an Elmore Leonard novel) and the cute-but-scrappy engenue (also a Leonard staple) and the jerk husband. None of them ever change. You never see anything redeemable in the husband, you never see the pettiness or selfishness that would render the hero a multiple-divorcee, or the wife such a loner. You just have to accept them, like TV-characters, to whom I think this book must be addressed. Cardboard cutouts.The only interesting character is the lummox, ""Earl"" or ""Tool"" - in whom we see glimmerings of affection and care."
4,A quick and enjoyable read.,"Chaz Perrone is driven by two things--money and releasing sexual energy. His wife, Joey, helps with one of these drives and gets in the way of the other. So, he chucks her overboard on their anniversary cruise.Joey Perrone is familiar with tragedy... her parents died when she was young, her first husband died in a freak accident, and her second husband has, well, chucked her overboard on their anniversary cruise. But, Joey survived her fall.The reader discovers the why's and how's of Chaz's crime early on, and will find humor in the ways in which Joey tries to pay him back and find out why he did it.I enjoyed this book, by an author whose work I've never read before. It was an enjoyable and twisted plot... perfect for reading while hanging out on the beach."
3,I listened to the book on CD,"It was very good; although my only complaint is that they abridged the book onto only 4 CD's. It escapes me why they abridge decent book like this! I rarely even listen to a book if it's abridged, but this one came recommended highly and I did enjoy this short story on CD. I've read other books by this author and wish he would have never agreed to the abridgement."
2,It was okay,"I got this book at the airport. I was desparate for something to read. Others had talked about this book but it did not do anything for me. I enjoy slow character development and details. This book had none of that. Its a quick read but you as the reader do not become invested in the characters. For me, that spells disaster."
2,Revenge book without a twist,"I have read one other book of Carl Hiaasen, ""Striptease"", which I liked. Skinny Dip however, was a straightforward revenge book without one twist. NOT A SUPRISE. EVER. ABC Movie of the Week material. Search ""Elmore Leonard"" for better dialogue and plot."
1,Bored Stiff,You can read all about the book just from what is included in the jacket. Unbelievable potrayal of a women cast off a ship by her husband. All she wants to know is did he love her when he married her? Why did he do it? I mean give me a break! I would not lay low and try to make him go insane. I would go to the police.I read books from beginning to end to give them a chance. This was a waste of my time.
3,Take the Plunge,"""Skinny Dip"", by Miami Herald columnist Carl Hiaasen, is a distinctly American adventure. A comedy with a hint of a social conscience, ""Skinny Dip"" chronicles the adventures of Dr. (of marine biology) ""Chaz"" Perrone after he tosses Joey, his beautiful wife of two years, overboard on their anniversary cruise. Chaz proceeds on the assumption that Joey has drowned or been eaten by sharks. Joey has other ideas, surviving the fall and ocean using her college-days swimming and diving skills, and staying alive just long enough to be rescued. Her mind is set on revenge (along with puzzlement as to why he did it). The action is set in South Florida and the Everglades. The result is a quick, fun summer read, reminiscent of Tom Robbins' comic novels. Cameron Diaz would be great for Joey. I'm still working on ""Chaz--Greg Kinnear, maybe."
4,Revenge has never been Sweeter!,"As she is pushed off the cruise ship, Joey Perrone has no clue why her husband wants her dead. Joey survives the dive in the Gulf Stream and is rescued by an ex-detective, Mick Stranahan. Together, they cook up a satisfying revenge for her conceited husband, Chaz. His self-indulgence and fascination with sex is absolutely comical! Chaz deserves everything that happens to him. This was one of the most enjoyable, well-written, and hilarious books I've read in a long time. My only criticism is that Hiaasen's tirades about the treatment of animals and the Everglades, on every other page, become quite trite. That said, it is Hiaasen's well-developed characters that make this an excellent read. I can't wait to read another Hiassen novel."
5,Loved It,"When it comes to Carl Hiaasen, either you love him or you don't. He has a style that takes no prisoners. There is no question how he feels about urban sprawl. He has watched Florida, as have I, ruined by over development and greed. If you look at an empty natural area and fantasize about condos and the money that could be made through development you will hate ALL of Carl's books. Also, I'm pretty sure the people who complain about the plausibility of his characters aren't very familiar with Florida. Yes, America, imagine it and you will find it in Florida. Carl knows Florida like the back of his hand. I immensely enjoyed this book. The story made me laugh out loud and cheer as the bad guys got theirs in that oh so gratifying Hiassen manner. If Carl Hiaasen is the master of anything, he's the master of satiric tales with painful realities we don't want to face about ourselves that bear out the timeless truth: ""You reap what you sow."""
3,"Funny, but absent of plot twists","I enjoyed this book, but given the nature of the subject matter was expecting complications to the wife's revenge scheme. But everything pretty much goes according to plan, so the end is a little bit of a let down."
3,Shades of Elmore Leonard,"The characters are two dimensional and and the plot is kind of flakey, but it fills the bill for a lite summer read. The only aspect that really bothered me was the moronic depictions of gun play."
4,Best of Hiaasen's book - a great summer read,Carl's books are nearly always fun light reading that capture Florida very well. This is the best of them IMHO. A very delightful read full of very odd and interesting characters.
3,Pedestrian,"If ""Skinny Dip"" were the final product of a college novel writing course, the professor would have no choice but to give the novel an A.Sympathetic heroine? Dastardly villain? Check.Is conflict set up properly, and does it create tension in the plot throughout the novel? Check.Is there a clean resolution that leaves readers satisfied? Check.Are there large, meta-themes that readers can connect with, and feel virtuous about for caring? Check.But while ""Skinny Dip"" does meet the basic standards for a good novel it really isn't one. There's a wide emotional disconnect between the characters and the reader -- while the characters all seem multifaceted they also don't seem credible and believable. The plot is pedestrian and entirely predictable. The book itself is a quick forgettable read."
4,"Fun, Engaging Book","I read this book in a day and a half - not because it's short (it isn't), but because I couldn't put it down.I really enjoyed the dialog - there is subtle humor all over the place."
4,"Great book, ripped cover","I loved the book. The cover came with a hole in it which I didn't expect. I wish the seller had told about the cover hole up front. However, it doesn't change how much I enjoyed reading Skinny Dip."
3,Enjoyable,"Good book, love the characters. Wasn't really happy with the ending...wanted to see Chaz really suffer at the end. Not that he wasn't suffering......wanted more details. Also wanted to see that everyone else knew what happened instead of it remaining a secret."
4,Entertaining,"This is the first novel I've read by Mr. Hiaasen. I had some time to kill at a local bookstore and began reading it, and couldn't put it down. The blend of interesting characters and twists and turns in the plot made for a very entertaining and interesting read. I laughed out loud more than once while reading this book! The only draw back I had was not having been a reader of his books before, I really didn't have past knowledge of Stranahan, one of the main characters, and feel he could have been better developed in this book. The other characters are hilarious!!! I'm already reading Skin Tight now and loving it too - always love to find a new author."
3,The Bad Guys weren't Bad Enough,"I never thought I would be disappointed with a Carl Hiaasen novel, but Skinny Dip fell short of my expectations. Hiaasen usually takes you through a wild ride through the craziness Florida with evil and incredibly stupid villains. The incredible wackiness of his previous works was missing here. Hiaasen fans like me will enjoy this, but if you are new to Carl Hiaasen, you would be better off reading gems like Strip Tease and Tourist Season."
5,Dippin into fun,"This was my first experience with Hiaasen. What a surprise! I was captured from page one, and smiled through-out. Fun, fast writing. Intriguing and inventive premise. Completely visual.Will give this book to family and pals for Christmas. Highly recommended by an avid book reader of all genres."
5,"Different, fast paced, screamingly funny, excellent read!","This book is really, really different. The characters are quirky and extremely funny. They do things you don't expect them to do. The villains are horrible and Joey is endearing, but they all make you laugh so hard you might wrench your back. I couldn't put this book down from the moment I picked it up, and I can't wait until the next one comes out. Carl Hiaasen is different from any mystery writer today-- Janet Evanovich, Sue Grafton, Joanne Fluke, Pamela Troutman-- but he's just as good a read. Don't miss this one!"
3,Dedicated to Warren Zevon,"I wanted to like _Skinny Dip_, I really did! But sometimes the Hiaasen formula clicks and sometimes it doesn't. This one's a miss, easily in the same category with the goshdarnawful _Strip Tease_ and _Lucky You_, neither of which are on my obligatory re-reading list due to their plodding non-cleverness. Very few jokes in this book, but lots of heavyhanded preaching.The next effort will be better. He seems to be ""on"" every other book.If you want to start on a screamingly funny Hiaasen, try _Native Tongue_ or _Stormy Weather_.I have faith. I won't stop reading."
2,Pedestrian,"I have read all of Carl Hiaasen's books and over the years they have gradually gone downhill in quality and interest. This book is not as bad as a couple of the books that preceded it but it is still quite ordinary in my opinion.It is just that the author seems to keep repeating the same characters and variations of them again and again. We have the hero, the inept baddie, the characters who are bad but have good characteristics.....The first few Hiaasen books were brilliant displays of black humour with the underpinnings of the environment but lately the humour has become less and the books have become run of the mill."
4,Not as funny as earlier works,"But still worth reading. Very quick to read. As has been mentioned, Skink's back in a 'cameo' appearance. There are only a couple of laugh-out-loud moments. There are a couple of times where the author drags on a little too long about the saving of the everglades (even if you agree with him, this is a work of fiction, not a political tract)."
3,Formula Wears Thin,"A crisply written revenge fantasy, indeed, but not the laugh riot we've come to expect from Hiaasen (Pick up ""Double Whammy"" or ""Tourist Season"" if you're looking for a real gut-busters). A few snorts, but nothing uproarious."
1,Not Good,"I ordered a NEW book --the one I received was Used and had a torn cover. So I could not give it as a gift to a sick friend. It came overnight which was better than expected, but it was and is useless. I've given up with Amazon and trying to talk to someone. When you buy there now it's Pot Luck."
4,Revenge is Sweet!,"The story starts simply enough. A husband throws his wife overboard during a ""romantic"" cruise. She is rescued by a reclusive former cop/investigator and their antic revenge makes for a funny and clever read. Hiassen has real talent for character development and getting the reader to develop affection and attachment for the protagonists. These anti-heros are human and loveable. He also introduces great ""bad guys"" who are buffoons you love to root against. The husband is an incredible amoral,venal buffoon who gets his just deserts.The plot is somewhat forseeable but nonetheless clever and satisfying. This isn't great literature, but great fun."
2,"Not a prude, but...",There is an interesting and different twist to this yarn. I am not a prude but the author was unnecessarily smutty in his overused vulgar language and graphic sexual encounters. A cute story that didn't need that for a good read.
2,Disappointing,"The book was for my wife and I did not read it. She said the book was disappointing, and it seemed to be obsessed with SEX. Too much emphasis put on sexual encounters and the book was not worth the time it took to read it."
2,Light and Fluffy,Not much to say except it was a decent book that pushed your imagination as well as its credibility.
5,Skin Dip,"Funny, action-packed and silly. Hiasson manages to develop one of the main characters to the point of absurdity but at the same time, he is very believable. I assigned Team Rodant for a class and my students loved it. I will purchase more of Hiasson's fiction and nonfiction works in the future."
3,Decent But Definitely Not HILARIOUS!!,"This was my first Hiaasen book - and I was really looking forward to it. But for all the reviews that talk about how zany and out there this book is, with hilarity on every other page, I tend to disagree. It was an enjoyable book, but I rarely found myself laughing out loud.I also found it interesting how Hiaasen felt the need to reveal to his readers how ""with it"" and ""hip"" he still is by adding references to Norah Jones, the Mini Cooper, Hummer H2s and a variety of other pop culture nuggets.Overall - I thought the book was going to be more ingenious and clever with sharp, witty Elmore Leonard style dialouge and a Vonnegut-like genius.oh well"
4,skinny dip,Fun characters you follow... uninhibited zany plot. After reading Skinny dip I bought a half dozen more of his books.
4,"Great Characters, laugh-out-loud morality tale","This is the first Hiaasen book I've ""read"" (listened to), but it won't be the last. The characters, though mostly one dimentional (except for the heavy), are hilarious. The scenery is lush. And the plot, which makes no attempt at believeability, is so tied together it's a Gordian knot. It's a murder mystery where no one is killed and you know from the start who did it.No fake ending either. The book just ends... maybe there'll be a sequel.The reader on this recording has a bit too much irony in his voice, but this is a minor complaint. He does an excellent job creating the characters. They come alive with his vocal inflection. I would not get the abridged version. Everything in this story is tied to everything else. If you miss something, you might lose an important thread."
3,Classic Hiaasen - Dropped Ball at the End,"I've read 'em all and, for the most part, have enjoyed em' all (Hiaasen's books that is). This one was a blast for the first 300 pages, but it really falls short at the end. For all of his creativity in creating ridiculously wacky characters, I can't believe that Mr. Hiaasen wasn't able to summon a more interesting or satisfying conclusion from his fertile mind. Too many plotlines are left open (or shallowly closed) and Chaz's comeuppance in the last 30 pages is rather clumsily handled. I'm generally not a big fan of Epilogues, but a 5-page Epilogue on this one would have been worthwhile."
4,Another Hiaasen Hit!,"I am a huge Hiaasen fan, so I am willing to read anything he writes. It's all funny, page turning, and politically satirical. This one does not let you down in any of those categories. If you are a Hiaasen fan this book will not let you down. If you've never read his books before...definitely read him. This book has a few returning characters, so it might not be the book to start with.Very good book!"
2,Drawn out.......,"I have to say the story line was great. However I feel it was over written in several places, and the story was dragged out a bit to far. I found myself saying enough already....I did enjoy most of the story, but glad it's over."
1,No more books from this author!,"This has got to be up there with the top 5 worst books I've ever read. There was not even one likeable or relatable character in the entire story. It started out ok but took a downward dive at page 20 or so (read this on my kindle). The plot was ridiculous, boring, and inconceivable. I could never recommend this book or author to anyone."
4,Just a FUN book to read,I've never laughed so much reading a book. Great entertainment couldn't put it down. Finished it in day. Loved it
5,Hiaasen does it again,"It has been awhile since Hiaaseen has released a book, but he surely hasn't lost his touch for wry humor and twisted plots. As usual, this is about corruption and nasty characters in Southern Florida, and the good guys who fight the good fight. The characters, even the bad guys, are hilarious. The novel clips right along with crisp, funny dialog and some very bizarre situations. Great read."
4,"Zippy, Funny, Fun","Yeah, the totally, hot chick Joey will drive you a little mad: she's fearless, she can swim like a dolphin, she looks great after hours in the sea with her make up washed off--essentially she's EVERYTHING I'M NOT! But if you can forgive her the coolness and strength, then you can laugh your way though this novel that moves so quickly you'll wish it didn't end so soon. This is a totally FUN read. And darnnit, YOU (the person reading this review) should quit being so damn serious all the time and lighten up a little. Go lounge on the hammock. Screw the dishes in the sink, or the unfolded laundry piled on the couch, or the grease stains on the garage floor that will take you hours and many toxic chemicals to remove. Relax and read this book today. It's much more fun than domestic chores and carpool!"
3,"So So, but good for laughs.","If your looking for a deep story with a complex plot, this isn't it. But if you want some light reading with more than a few chuckles, Skinny Dip will fit the bill. I enjoyed it on a weekend in Miami."
2,Turning the crank,"Skinny Dip is a product of the entertaining Hiasen formula engine. A young married woman is unceremoniously dumped off a cruise ship by her husband of two years. She's fortunate to be rescued by a misanthropic retired cop who lives on a tiny island in the Florida Keyes. Yes, her husband is a jerk, but why did he want to kill her?This book is by no means the strongest of Hiasen's (my favorite remainsNative Tongue) but is still entertaining and provides the satisfaction of seeing the nature-hating polluters pay for their crimes."
2,Skinny Dip Dips Too Low,"With Skinny Dip, Mr. Hiaasen joins the ranks of novelists who depend on sex to sell their work. The sad truth is that his descriptions of the many encounters that take place in this story are unrealistic and borderline rediculous. The plot of the story should have been self sustaining without use of all the dribble. Mr. Hiaasen also delves into a relationship that developes inside a nursing home which served only to prove that he has never set foot in a nursing home himself.Conversations between the various characters show a lack of consistancy to the profile he has created for them.I will borrow his next novel rather than buy it."
1,Don't Buy,"It pains me to say this but if the rating would have allowed it this publication would have got a ""No Star"" rating from me.It fails miserably in my view to give any new or interesting thought and simply recurgitates old boring material. Worse still it implies that this is ground breaking because it's applied in the context of team selling.A Baboon could have written this and the only creative writing comes in the marketing spin that has been used to hype this book!!"
1,The worst sales book I've ever read..,I have been in sales for almost 30 years. I've managed very large teams in multiple areas across the country. This book offers no real techinique or inspiration. The only thing I am motivated to do after reading this is to write my own book!
4,False Witness,"Enjoyed the characters and their relationships despite their differences. Although it was a slow start, I couldn't put it down by the time I was half way through the story."
3,Good story,"Overall this was an interesting story. It was tough to get into due to the simplistic school report style of writing. Only kept reading because I was puzzled by the reviews that said it was a page turner they couldn't put down. Eventually became interested about what would happen next, because it does have a good premise."
2,False Witness,"I could not finish this book. I felt like the writer was a teenager writing something for a school project. I started to skim thinking I could get to the good parts that way, but after a few chapters I just gave up."
4,great barn gloves,really useful barn gloves--padded feel but not too bulky. i wouldn't call them dress gloves.really a good fitwhat more can u want?
3,Warm and comfortable but not of high quality,"My husband and I gave the gloves to six ladies and I purchased a pair for myself. All of the ladies were polite in their comments, but clearly they were as disappointed in the leather quality as we were. The leather was not of the quality we expected for ""Italian leather"" and thy are not fashioned for ""dress."" However, the gloves are warm and comfortable to wear. The sizes were generous and appropriate, but I would reserve my recommendation to include the stipulation that one is looking for warmth, not quality."
2,more utilitarian than anything,"I was really excited when the I read all the reviews, but am sad to say I'm disappointed. The gloves are really warm and soft inside and out, but it's not what I expected. I must have extremely small hands as the gloves are too big for me. I also find them bulky for leather gloves. They aren't very feminine, so if you're looking for a pair of gloves that are purely utilitarian then it's a great deal for leather gloves."
5,Great quality for the price.,"Bought these as a gift for my daughter. I was surprised at the high quality of the gloves because they were so reasonably priced, and they arrived in a reasonable length of time. I would purchase from this vendor again!"
2,a rambling mess of forgettable stories,"Sorry, but I have to completely disagree with the other reviewers. 'The Neon Wilderness' contains several stories of down-and-outs living in Chicago in the 1940s. Although the author has the local language and the feel of the streets down pat, he forgot to write anything *interesting*. The characters are generally not likable or encourage sympathy, and oftentimes the prose is utterly incomprehensible. Nope, I really didn't like this book at all.Bottom line: this book does not deliver a pleasant reading experience."
1,Cheaply Designed,"I purchased this lamp so that I could expand lighting in my bedroom which is where I use my pc. I had to buy these 4"" halogen bulbs and they would only last a few wks. before they would explode! Finally, the heat from the bulbs cracked the glass dome so rather than be injured, I just threw it away. I purchased it from [...] who I'll never deal with again. So now I've been working in the dark because I cannot seem to find a decent floor lamp w/a dimmer switch and one large energy saving bulb that just plugs right in. I had a friend who found one at a building store but they were out of stock when I looked for one. Usually I have no problems ordering online but there are exceptions to every rule."
4,Fantastic Clamp Set,"I must admit, I was a bit hesitant initially. But I am really impressed with the clamp set!The 4 larger clamps have easy-to-use releases that allow you to quickly release the clamp; the 4 smaller clamps do not, but then, when using the smaller clamps you tend to be working on pieces that require a lighter touch anyway.The 7 smaller 'clip' clamps have just the right amount of tension; the larger ones are almost difficult to open fully, which gives you a fair indication of the compression strength.The only reason I'm giving the set 4 stars rather than 5 is that it would be incredible to swap a couple of the 'clips' for 'clamps'. In that case, I would not hesitate to declare them perfect.If you need a few clamps, you would do well to get this set; I've purchased others, but these are the ones I go back to day after day. Comfortable grips, secure, easy to adjust, sturdy.In fact, I think I'm going to order some more. After all, you can never have too many good clamps!"
2,Flimsy clamps,"This may do the trick, but they are relatively flimsy and under tension, the bar flexes too much.I have a higher-end set of clamps, and I like them a lot more."
1,BUYER BEWARE,I ordered 1000 chips from this company. I received two DIFFERENT styles of the same chip that did not stack up to the same height. This is a huge problem to any poker player. I spent 26 days of emails and phone calls and the problem was never fixed. Totally DISAPPOINTED and will NEVER shop here again!
1,Broken beauty,"It's a beautiful set but arrived broken. There is not enough packaging to securely transport this poker set. Considering it's weight and size, the seller needs a lot of improvement in terms of shippng to get it to you in one piece. But hey, that's what you get for buying a cheap toy, right?"
3,Not a fan of the chips,"This set is an excellent value (and I got chose free shipping and it arrived the next day!), but I'm not crazy about the chips. As you can see from some of the customer pictures (not the product pictures!), from the side the chips appear white with the color stripes. I would have preferred a chip that looked like the majority of it's color from the side (like in the product pics), instead of the 8 equal sized color sections. And the white and black chips are confusing. The white chips (150 of them) appear black from the side because they are printed opposite of the rest of the chips, and the black chips (50 of them) appear white from the side. Could be better. The cards feel decent, but I have a feeling they won't last long."
4,Seller wanted to make me happy,"I'm very happy with my purchase. I wanted poker chips, and I got good poker chips. The set was speedily delivered to me. There was a problem in that the dealer buttons were not included in my set. I wrote a mediocre review of the product. As a result, someone at the company contacted me and wanted to know how they could make my purchase better. They sent me the missing dealer buttons. I'm impressed with the fact that they do show concern for the customer's experience and want to make you happy."
2,"Chips fine, leather case poorly designed","The chips in this set are fine, nice weight and design. But, the leather case does not stay open. The ""hinge"" is a piece of leather connecting the bottom to the top and it is not wide enough to let the top stay open. This means you have to hold the top open with one hand and take out the chips with the other, which is quite cumbersome."
4,Nice set,"Great chips. Nice and heavy, good quality. The inside of the case is a little cheap feeling. The cards are used cansino cards. Both of my decks were marked with drink spills."
4,Heavy duty.,"Quite pleased with this purchase. The chips seem like clay, even though they probably aren't. The cards aren't the best, but you really should have a few decks anyway and they will be good for back ups. It came promptly and was well protected in two boxes. Nice."
5,Poker Chips,"ChipsAndGames Premium Set of 500 11.5 gr Ace-King Suited Poker Chips w/6 Dealer Buttons & Poker Dice (Purchased on 12/05/2008)by Chips And GamesI received an excellent product above from Chips and Games. The set of chips was well packed and in excellent condition and arrived when it was supposed to arrive. My son-in-law loves it for their poker parties. I would not hesitate to order again from Chips and Games, and I have already sent them a personal note telling them so."
3,I could be wrong....,"I could be wrong but I recieved this product and they don't seem like clay composites to me. They feel like and look like the weighted plastic chips. Of course they serve their purpose, but they were a bit disappointing to me. If your not a picky consumer the set will satisfy your needs, but beware if you're strictly looking for the clay feel."
5,Jefferson Davis,This is ! of 4 volumes that links President Davis personal story w/the history of the confederacy. It shows how his state rights views were challenged by reality of running a united confedaracy of independent states
3,"Nice translation, but poor printing job!","This public domain translation is nice (with some quaint antiquated language.) The trouble is that the Italian is on one leaf of a page, and the English is on the back, so they are difficult to compare side by side because you have to keep flipping the page back and forth! This is an unfortunate detail, because otherwise there are many quality aspects of this publication, including lovely cover art."
5,An Excellent Pierogi Press!,"I love this thing. Every year my husband and I make the dough, filling, and shape at least 250 pierogis for Xmas eve dinner. We used to have to accomplish this lofty goal by hand, which would generally end with both of us dealing with a case of what felt like carpel-tunnel, but no more!! With this handy press we made 450 pierogi yesterday with nary and injury!A few tips for users:1) We found that it is best to dust the inside of the press with a little flour each time, or else the dough sticks.2) Make sure the dough pieces do not get caught in the hinges when you are pressing because it's difficult to get the dumpling out3) have a sharp knife handy because you have to cut away the excess dough from the outside of the gadget. (In the future I would like to purchase a new stainless steal press which will cut the excess for me)All in all a great product!!!"
3,works well but expensive,"I have one of these and it saves me a lot of time when making large amounts of gyoza or ravioli. Yes you need the right size wonton wrappers but I never have trouble finding these. What I don't understand is why is it so expensive? I picked one up at the Chinese supermarket for $1, and that's all it's really worth. In the end it's just a cheap piece of plastic and shouldn't cost more than $1."
1,"Does the job, but not impressive","I looked at a few other dumpling presses on Amazon before going with Helen's Dumpling Press. I liked that the press had handles.The dough needs to be the exact round shape as the press, if not--if the dough drapes over the edge, a knife or something sharp is necessary to cut off the excess dough. The press merely presses the edges together. The pleated edge looks nice and is about the same width as the ""stuffed"" part of the dumpling. Be careful while pressing because the hinges tend to pinch the dumpling/dough.This press is time consuming to use (i.e. getting it to work correctly and properly). Also, the plastic does not seem very durable; the ""handles"" bend easily. In the end, I just made the dumplings by hand (ans the press).I gave it 1 star for ease of use and for time-saving."
4,Great beginnings,"Well, for a mix of their earliest EP's this serves well for someone new to the band who wants a summary of their oh-so-hard to find vinyl EP's. Although they are mixed up, i put them in order (from EP to EP) on my ipod & added the missing tracks (from the Tattooed Ladies EP). Its easier to take in if everything is in order. A definite addition for a full, respected EYES collection."
5,In touch with my inner groove,"Though not my usual type of music, I was drawn into the beat and stayed for the funky exposition. Nothing trite or derivative, these tunes gave my brain something to think on and booty something to shake about. Or about which to shake, more properly. Check it out."
2,The Very Best of Cher - Special Edition,I was disappointed. The bonus cd has all the same songs as the 1st cd. I feel this is not the best example of the 'Best of Cher'.
4,somewhat satisfied,I really like the song's on the cd.Unfortionutly i have problems with it playing in a vehicle every little bump it skips.i just listen to it in the house so as to not let it skip and destoy it.Her song's are awesome she is a wonderful singer.
3,met my needs,The set met my needs I was hoping it would have a slipcover so that I can keep it in its case but I ended up having to split it up into the original cases that I already had because it had no slip cover
2,Cher,Cher is my all time favorite and this Cd is great but the Cd casing itself was cracked and the Cd was not effected but it would have been nice if the case wasn't broken.
5,AWESOME,"Cher is the greatest music diva the world has ever seen.This is an excellent music compilation of her greatest work. I find myself carried away by her tunes, my favorite being ""Gypsies, Tramps, and Thieves"". I look forward to buying more of Cher's stuff."
2,chers hits,"expecting a great album and found a lousy poorly arranged album, choice of songs are terrible!!!"
5,Pure pop genius,"There are many legitimate ways to criticize Cher and her music, but in the end, you'll be happier to succumb to her determined world-weary vocals which have an oddly affecting and convincing emotional consistency -- nevermind how silly some of these songs are. She embraces pop music with a wink, and let's us know we're in on the fun -- unlike, say, Madonna who takes herself way too seriously. Cher knows her limitations, and this becomes her endearing virtue. She may be a self-made glamorous creation, but she somehow manages to keep it real. Most of her best singles are here, and it's a blast with some minor exceptions. I think the remix version of ""One By One"" used here is very weak, compared to the original British version, or even the American album release version, and the exclusion of ""The Way of Love"" is glaringly wrong. Still, what's here is giddy fist-pumping butt-wiggling pop music at its best."
5,An awesome licensing feat!,"The mind boggles at the number of label changes Cher has gone through in her long, long recording career. Perhaps to Cher, labels are like costumes.Over the years she's gone through Atlantic/Atco, MCA, Warner Bros (twice!!), Casablanca, Columbia, Geffen etc etc. And by some astonishing feat, they have managed to negotiate successfully to bring all of her hits to the one package. Amazing, and highly recommended."
5,Still a Great Diva,"Just received The Very Best Of Cher (Special edition)set of 2 CD's. Even tho a lot of the songs are the same, I still enjoy both very much. The one Performed ""Live"" is a change, because I can visualize Cher doing her special on TV, which was great.She is ageless! And I never get tired of her music.I would recommend this set for anyone who is a real fan of Cher."
4,Cher will always be Good!,I enjoyed this cd a lot - I've loved Cher forever!! I wish she would do a duet with the sexy Michael Bublé -- I think they would look and sound fabulous together. Please Cher??
1,cher cd,only 3 of the songs played. the cd was scratched. very disappointed . took me awhile to get it also i had to email them and remind them to send it by xmas.
5,For the reviewer with brain damage,"Who cares what a stupid person from nowhere (oops i mean New Zealand) has to say about Cher, She is the BEST! You are a nobody, so..... a recomendation... get yourself a brain. CHER ROCKS!!! You and your questions SUCK! ^_^ The very best of Cher is a great album and a must have for everyone."
5,CHER RULES!!!,"This CD is fantastic! Actually,there is no words to describe how great it is! For all you Cher fans, BUY THIS CD!!! You'll love it!I've listened to it nonstop since I got it and know each and every song by heart!! CHER RULES!!!"
3,The Very Best Of Cher,"It has alot of good songs, but I felt it needed more I would have liked to be a 2 disc set then it would have been the very best cause a lot of my faviorite songs were not in it!Like Carousel Men etc...but it is still good and worth getting!"
5,5 million stars!!!!,How can anybody not like Cher. Her music is top notch as a solo artist as well as the masterpieces she put together with her late husband Sonny Bono.This set collects them all and captures her magnificent voice that changed the music industry forever.I want to marry this woman!
4,4 Decades Of N'1 Hits,"Firstly....there is no other artist who can come as close to either Cher or Madonna. Both of them (are) and will always remain as legendary artists!.Secondly...I don't believe that this CD signaled the end of Cher's entire (recording) career (...)this is CHER...the women who always comes back, the cat with 9 lives, which she's probably got 4 left!.And Thirdly...This is a excellent collection of Cher's best songs...While it includes all her chart-topping hits. Well-done, Cher once again celebrates 40 years of Music industry.This Disk is a must have for fans of Madonna's ''GHV2'' Collection!."
1,Same songs,I was disappointed because there were so many duplicates on the two CDs - the quality was good but for the price - I think there was too much duplication
1,do I have to give a star?,"Cher is everything that is wrong with music and has been for sometime now. Thirty five years now and a slew of help along the way has given this monster a world wide reputation. If there was the least bit of talent, I'd have no reson to write this review. If you feel the need to buy played out hogwash with no talent for singing or playing any sort of instrument, waste your money here. All I can do is shake my head."
1,really awful,i would request that this is one album which you should avoid at all costs.this awful cd is bad beyond description and i really wonder when this old woman will call it a day and stop harrasing us.she only became famous because of her short lived association with the great greg allman.avoid.rating 1/2 out of 10.get rust in peace from megadeth instead.
1,despise it,please get rid of this cd and this old woman who should call it a day.it is a shame to call this package of 21 terrible songs as best of collection as to me it sounds more like lousy hits.trash this immediately.avoid.
1,The very Best of Cher aka The very Worst of music,"I don't see how anyone can stand to listen to her. I can think of probably 1000s artists better than her. Even Britney Spears has a chance to become better than Cher. For your own safety please don't buy this album.Warning: Side-effects from listening to this CD include: nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and bleeding through the ears, as well as severe brain damage(which explains why so many people continue to buy her albums)."
2,not very best of Cher,"the dvd of her ""last performance"" which shares the same cover design is far superior to this version, songs, etc."
5,Excelente Edicion Internacional !,"Me Arrepiento de Haber comprado el Cd En la version de EE.UU porque no es totalmente completa faltan canciones como The Music's No Good Whithout You y Otras, Por Eso le Doy 5 Estrellas."
4,ONCE AGAIN CHER SHOWS THAT SHE'S THE BEST.,"As many of us know, CHER is the only female singer with number ONE hits along 5 decades in world music history. This compilation includes just some of her major hits.And I say that just some because there are missing a lot of them.Any way this is a must for every Rock-Pop-music lovers.HIGHLY RECCOMENDED, BUT I ALSO RECOMEND YOU THE INTERNATIONAL RELEASE VERSION, THAT CONTAIS 2 DISCS WITH 42 TRACKS.THIS ONE IS JUST PERFECT. DON'T LET IT GO...CHER RULES."
3,The 3rd Greatest Hit Album Cher Has Produced!?!,"Good things about this album : new tracks from her last two albums, plus some duets from Sonny & Cher period. Bad things about this album : She already has two other (if not more) greatest hits albums. Her 99' ""IF I Could Turn Back Time : Cher's Greatest Hits"" has everything that a Cher fan would need in their entire lifetimes.Why buy this album? If you are a Cher fanatic, and must own any and every Cher album, or has not bought ""IF I Could Turn Back Time : Cher's Greatest Hits"", then you should definitely buy this album. Otherwise, don't spend the money."
5,The One True Diva,"After going to the Minneapolis concert in the Living Proof Farewell Tour, and now listening to this CD many, many times, I can only say she is AWESOME! I grew up with this woman's music; I am very close to her in age, and all I can say is she rocks! She is so inspiring of a role model for other women like myself. Every time I listen to this CD I am blown away at her incredible talent. No one even comes close!"
4,How can anyone not like Cher?,"You gotta get this collection, because there is just so much here...the early ""Sonny"" material, the ""story"" songs like ""Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves"", the ""movie music"", as well as the dance club-themed modern pieces. For many of her fans, Cher has been dispensing wisdom, solace and fun for over thirty years, and although some reviewers insist on calling her a ""diva"", I think she's more like an eccentric aunt who has really wacky clothes and hangs with even wackier friends. This may be her ""farewell"" tour, but the music will endure forever."
5,"If You love Cher, then you will LOVE this CD","If you are a fan of Cher, then you will love this CD. It's got all her best hits, old and new. My 2 year old daughter even loves to sing along to The Beat Goes On. You won't regret buying this CD!!"
1,It's The Same Ol' Songs,"Being a (Sonny and) Cher fan for over 30 years,their music didn't set the world on fire,but made a lasting impression on pop music.This cd is a rehash of Greatest Hits after Greatest Hits Cds.I prefer to see the real Cher.From her back up days with Phil Spector,including hr first recording as Bonnie Jo Mason and Cherilyn to the dance diva she has become.Alot of other singers have had unreleased box sets.It's time for (Sonny and)Cher to have theirs.Ranging from Atco through Imperial to Kapp to MCA<Warner Bros,Columbia,Geffen back to Warner Bros.That would really be worth buying.Not just the same songs only to be replaced by a diffferent photo."
3,BONNIE TYLERS VERSION STILL BETTER,BONNIE TYLER DID THE ORIGINAL SAVE UP ALL YOUR TEARS AND I HAVE TO SAY ITS STILL MY FAVOURITE. SHE ALSO DID BACK UP VOCALS ON ONE OF CHERS ALBUMS AND A DUET. IF U LIKE CHER I SAY GO BUY BONNIE AS WELL SHE ROCKS
2,the older songs are much better,"Well it's true the new ones are bad really bad. If you buy this album listen only to the old good songs and forget about the ones. I was a fan of Cher but not anymore but I still like her songs well, some of her songs. As a person she's not a very friendly person and she's a dive and really thinks she's the best and why does she look so awful and ugly. I wonder....Mmmmm"
2,Cher might look good for her age but she cannot sing,"Cher has been around since the 60's and she may of had a few hits but still she cannot sing.She sounds alot like Madonna.Now some of her songs were catchy such as I Got You Babe,Half Breed,If I Could Turn Back Time,and Gypsys,Tramps,& Thieves.But as for the song Believe...that was just horrible....but if your a new Cher fan...this would be good for you"
1,Bought Out of Pressure,I bought this album out of pressure as a gay man because EVERY gay man is supposed to like Cher. I have even tried to like her but think her voice is terrible and her songs lame. Believe has to be the most overrated song in recent memory. I like the version they play on South Park much better. I give the one star to Dark Lady because it is the best song on the album.
1,Not another Cher compilation!,"Great, more money for Cher so she can ""plastic"" herself into eternal youth. There are a few decent songs on here but do we really need ""essential"" tracks like ""The Shoop Shoop Song""(track 13) or ""Bang Bang"" (track 15)? One reviewer suggested that Cher be inducted to the rock and roll hall of fame. Does she even write her own music? The hall should be reserved for truly talented songwriters and performers. In my opinion Cher has never advanced to a level beyond her own shallow preocupations."
5,A Must Read,"This book is one of the top 5 books every believer should read if interested in the topic of the rapture. It's perfect for any individual, scholar and new believer alike. It does, in my opinion, get a little wordy, and I actually wished the book would have been a bit shorter, but overall this is a very important work written by a very humble man that does not wish to divide his pre-trib brothers, but is willing to take abuse for his beliefs.Every Christian owes it to themselves to research this subject rather than to simply believe the majority around them, and I believe this is a fine place to begin.Dave Bussard, author of ""Who Will Be Left Behind And When?"""
4,"Well written, a must read for Pre-tribbers","A well written book. It definetely helped chage some of my perspectives. His work on defining the Day of the Lord was excellent and irrefutable. The questioning of assumptions held by the pre-daniel's 70th week position are wonderful as I too once held these assumptions.There are some things that are difficult to explain concerning reconcilling the ""Last Trumpet"" of the Rapture in 1 Cor 15 and the 7th trumpet in Revelations. Who knows how all that will work out? Still, it's the best book on eschatology that I have yet to read."
3,Pre-wrath,The sender did a great job. The book itself is very bad and should never have been written.
1,A False View of the timing the Rapture,"Just about half the book's material is agreeable. Then the false doctrine is inserted. The sixth seal is considered to be the begging of God's wrath, hence the rapture of the saints takes place before God's wrath therefore ""Pre-Wrath"". The Bible on the other hand teaches plainly that the seals (all 7 of them) are part of God's judgement or wrath. The book is misleading and the theory is ""NEW"" -- shouldn't that speak volumes. Over the hundreds of years of Biblical exegises, NOW comes along a ""NEW"" view."
5,Marvin Rosenthal is right on the money..........,"Greetings to all in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ. I have read Marvin""s ""Pre Wrath Rapture"" and have to say it is excellent. Rosenthal's book goes into several Scriptures in his understanding of what the Bible says about End times. Kudos to Mr Rosenthal for writing a book that will have a impact in years to come."
2,"If the book ain't funny, can you learn anything from it?","The one and only practical guide for every occasion, situation, and disaster (no kidding). I couldn't believe this was really a ""how to book"" but it is. Unfortunately, it takes itself much too seriously to be funny itself and the instruction is about as dry as a desert. This is definitely not a ""do as I do"" sort of instruction book."
1,Not funny,"This book's title gives it a lot to live up to, but doesn't deliver. It's always better to under promise and over deliver, but this is the complete opposite. The book is hard to read, and hard to relate to. I have tried to apply some of the things in this book, but was rewarded with an awkward, silent gaze. I had more success with my own humor than what is described in this book.-Michael Le Clech[...]"
1,more like how NOT to be funny,"This book was terrible! I did not laugh at any of his joke examples. I wish I had known he was a writer for Jay Leno, I would never have bought the book. Sorry to be negative, but I have to warn others!"
4,"Pretty good book, but...","The book is pretty good in a lot of respects, but the techniques and methods Jon delivers seem more theoretical than practical. Steve Allen's How to be funny: Discovering the comic you is a better book in that respect. An even better and more practical/simple book I had found is Stanley Lyndon's How to be funny (howtobefunny.net). But considering everything, all 3 books are good and cover the various points on being the everyday funny person. My advice is that you buy all three as they don't cost that much together. Have fun!Rogers."
3,You need to do your homework if you're not an american before reading this book,"The book is an easy read and can be read in one or two sittings.As a non-american, reading the books and understanding most of the examples required me to look up for most of the mentioned personalities and TV shows.Most of the techniques are very specific and I found them to only work within a given society only.The other techniques in the book are plain commonsense...but nonetheless they might be a good reminder for those who lost it:PI wouldn't suggest this book for non-americans."
1,Warning Label Needed for this Book,"This book needs a warning label - ""Buyer Beware"". How does Macks get to write these books? If his record on writting TV shows (Jon Macks just completed writing the disaterous series ""K Street"" on HBO which was just cancelled) means anything to anyone, then save your dollars. This guy can't really come up with anything funny to say that is not still from the Michael Jackson era or Monica Lewinsky and Bill Clinton era. I tried to enjoy the book based on what I saw of the author on television recently. There are plenty of other books out there from well seasoned comedians that will do you better."
5,Fantastic Book for chemists and medicinal chemists,"Some books of this nature tend to focus on the synthesis of drug molecules and less about how they work and why. This book is just the opposite and walks the reader through a logical progression of drug discovery, design and target specificity. This book makes a great introduction to Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics which could be considered the bible of the subject."
4,Good book with few flaws,"The book is great for understanding the title subject. But it has too many references which distracts the reader. Also, many times, the corresponding picture of a particular topic covered is not in the same page as the topic. This requires going back and forth between pages. The problems at the end of each chapter are really good and checks the understanding of the subject thoroughly."
4,what it was,2nd books in the series frequenly lag in line and quality this one did less than others a kend I was still enjoying the read
4,Ahead of its time and Right on for Today,"For all lovers of the Sime/Gen series, this is another wonderful world you will totally love. Jacqueline Lichtenberg was way ahead of her time with this series, which focuses on characters of different races, and how the re-act to environmental issues when environment, politics, and personal ambition meet head on. Highly recommended."
4,This Film May Well Warm Your Heart,"The Day I Saw Your Heart begins slowly and I almost turned it off fifteen minutes in. I'm glad I stayed with it! The core of the story explores the relationship between an indefatigable, quirky, aging father (played to perfection by Michel Blanc) and his tempestuous daughter who blames him for her inability to stay with a man and thus make a life for herself. Closely observed and psychologically astute, The Day I Saw Your Heart rings true as it looks at the distance that can separate people who long for love but are too proud, or too emotionally vulnerable, to seek it. I thought the film was well-written, engagingly acted, and realized admirably by its director who clearly knows how to build a story compellingly by focusing on the nuances in the way people relate as opposed to how they present themselves or wish to be seen by others. Poignant and entertaining, The Day I Saw Your Heart warmed my heart as it may well warm yours."
5,A sweet and entertaining film with great actors!,"The Day I Saw Your Heart from French filmmaker Jennifer Devoldere is a sweet, hilarious coming-of-age film touching on themes of love, family and father-daughter relationship. Delicate and full of tenderness, the film is both entertaining and moving in its depiction of a father (Michel Blanc) and his daughter (Melanie Laurent) who can't say `'I Love You''. Years of lies have damaged their relationship; yet The Day I Saw Your Heart is evocative for its surprisingly optimistic conclusion...I have seen Inglorious Basterds and Beginners and I found Melanie Laurent's performance to be once again outstanding. Her alchemy with young French actor Guillaume Gouix operates wonderfully while her intimate game with Michel Blanc is to be remembered.The quality of the writing and the originality of the directing make filmmaker Jennifer Devoldere a talent to watch.I highly recommend this film that the general audience will find sweet and truly optimistic."
3,Celebrity camio heaven...,"I admit I watched the movie because *NSYNC was in it. But besides their really funny bit parts the movie was a no brainer. It was what it set out to be. A movie full of celebrity bit parts, and Lou Pearlman's up and coming acts, with a story line without much imagination. It was totally predictable and lets face it, it was never meant to be a Oscar nominee. But if you want a movie that will make you laugh, even when your not supposed to, watch Longshot."
4,"So many stars, you'll need an extra pair of eyes...","If you love (like me!) all those up and coming pop stars such asInnocense, Take 5 and others, as well as the already pop superstars NSYNC, O-Town, LFO and Britney Spears... you'll LOVE this movie! It has guest appearances from everybody including some such as Kenny Rogers, Howie D's sister Pollyana, Kevin Eubanks (The Tonight Show) and so many more! The plot may be a repeat of the typical cheesy teen movie, but with so much great talent and music, you can't go wrong! This is a MUST HAVE for any hard core pop fan! (and while you're at it, get the soundtrack too!)"
5,WONDERFUL!,"I loved this movie SOOOO much, its great.. :). It has an even balance and puts people in there you wouldnt expect (ex: Britney Spears as a flight attendant). Its one of those movies that if ur not looking for a minute, u could miss something :). Great storyline too with Lazlo and everything, great great movie- one of my favorites. And, to all BSB fans out there- Howie D.'s sister- Pollyanna is in it *she's a waitress, answers the little girl's question about when the pizza will be ready.* Has something for everyone in it."
4,Sleazy electro-punk - MORODER meets SEX PISTOLS in Berlin,"I've been wondering just who in the heck PING PONG BITCHES were ever since I saw a magazine cover with BASEMENT JAXX wearing a tattered PPB t-shirt?! Now that I've tracked down the (sadly OOP) CD EP, I can say the wait was worth it: five tracks of sleazy, twisted electro-punk produced by JAGZ KOONER and featuring blazin' circa '77 guitar power chords from the one & only STEVE JONES from the SEX PISTOLS, i.e. JONESY'S JUKEBOX! This is the kinda comically ""perverted"" dance/pop stew that either clears or packs dancefloors - but it sure has lots of ATTITUDE. The opening track ""BEAT YOU UP"" with its hi-octane MORODER disco bassline pastiche and the explosive punk stom of ""ROCK ACTION"" are the price of admission alone. WHERE'S THE FULL ALBUM?! This came out in 2001 - uh, its' 2005!"
1,Not Great,"I guess because it's out of print and Anthony Bourdain has mentioned it that this book became a bit of must read in the food world. Crazily, for awhile, some copies were going for a few hundred dollars. I ended up finding it at the library and I'm certainly glad I didn't buy it. It isn't that great of a book or that great of a story. Sorry."
4,NOt that bad,"I gave this 4 stars for heart and fornthe fact its abetter than expected slasher film, is it simnialr to Darkness falls yeah in ways is it better...NO. BUt its not boring has good kills and it a good waste of time, and i only spent ten bucks"
2,Blood Addiction.,"Oh Lord..I love Vampire movies, and this kinda delivers. more like near dark though and that was just ok admittedly far superior acting to this train wreck of a film. but the Idea of a pair of drug addicts becoming vampires, and then becoming addicted (following addictive behavior patterns) to Blood! its just sad that the execution of such a great idea was so poor. and I truly love vampire films, even most of the B style vamp flicks but this? My Personal Recommendation is: if you Must see this film RENT ONLY 2 star and thats being generous because of the blood addiction idea. and some funny gore (gore being funny here is bad trust me) Avoid..."
3,It's odd ball but I enjoyed it; Go figure,"The only reason I picked this dvd up was because Clare Kramer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer ""Glorificus"") stared in it.When the movie started I said to myself; here we go, this looks like a real piece of junk you just got yourself into, but after watching for a while it was not that bad and I actually started to enjoy it.It is off beat, and obviously a B-rated movie, but give it a chance, what is it going to set you back, $6.00; OH NO!I just don't understand why Kramer has not gotten more and better parts in her carrier. I was very impressed with her Glorificus (Glory) part."
2,think Lifetime-quality horror,"This was a somewhat entertaining movie, but had the feel of a Lifetime horror flick, or one made for TV. Its hard to express exactly what that means, these types of movies are heavy on long, slow plot development and very light on making the climactic horror scenes believable and worthwhile. No different here. The story development is generally entertaining, but it is slow and drawn out. However, the scenes that should be scary are very amateurish. The way these scenes are pulled off leave a lot to be desired; the camera work and editing are weak, which is disappointing given that the buildup to the scary scenes is actually pretty good. Worth a rental when you've seen mostly everything else, but definitely below average."
2,not very good,"whoever wrote this movie must have watched: rob zombie flicks, near dark, texas chainsaw, troma movies, and dusk 'til dawn too many times. a pale imitation to these with subpar soundtrack. a previous reviewer stated that there was too much sex in this movie. we must have watched different versions because although there was topless scenes, nothing remotely close to eroticism. there is plenty of gushing blood for you gorehounds out there. this is definately a ""rent once only"" release. as you all probably know, clare kraemer is in this mess and i got it for that reason. she was far better and more dynamic in buffy. anyway, purchase at your own risk."
3,It is what it is,"If you approach it for what it is, it's a dark, fun little movie that's unassuming and self-parodying, with a simple plot and all the cliches of the genre (particularly the sexual ones). Whether that's all intentional or not, I don't know, but with the likes of Stephen J. ""A-Team"" Cannell, it's anybody's call. The effects are, shall we say, well-intentioned but cheesy, and the cast has fun with it (particularly Andromeda's Steve Bacic playing a stoner musician). I enjoyed ""Tooth Fairy"" more with the commentary added: Cannell has a lot to say about filmmaking - staging, angles, etc, and it was interesting. If you're looking for a horror movie your squeamish friends can sit through with you, this will do. If you're a horror junkie looking to soil your pants, this probably isn't a good choice for you. I just plain liked it."
4,good,"me and my husband liked it. watch and judge yourself dont , watch it cuz i told u to r some1 else says not to."
3,YUMMY! But Not Variety!,"I've had Muscat Kasugai gummies before and I loved them. They taste like real muscadine grapes!I'm only giving this a 3 because when I bought this - I thought I was getting a variety pack! Even though the picture shows a variety, you only get muscat flavor! Also, the picture shows them in a kind of box, they arrive in a bag (25 pieces). Therefore - Read the description carefully! The description says that a variety of flavors are available, not that you actually get a variety!"
5,Fantastic,"Muscadine grapes are my favorites. These gummies are remarkably close in taste, texture, and smell to the real thing....sweet with a touch of sour. I enjoyed the different shapes (heart or round). The smell is incredible!"
4,yes!,a great band from germany. they rock and know how to roll and make the ladies scream!must have cd if you are looking for some raw rock a billy from this time.
5,"Never Compromise at ""The"" Open","Sampson for me is the consummate golf writer; clever, knows his game and does it all creatively. Witness the way he puts together this chronicle of The Open. Starts with the Morris' and their famed dominance of early golf, then the interest of England and the rest.Interwoven here are the rest of glorious Open history-Palmer, Player, Nicklaus, Watson, and Hogan. Then the tie with Carnoustie and the wee little iceman.Boy this author can captivate you while getting it all down. This flows and ebbs till it ends up at the Burn and that 18th. Never Compromise --- great putting with new found friend--- never compromise style -- must go for it!This is like author's other books (try them out, especially Hogan and Eternal Summer and Masters, they're favorites) this was just excellent reading to the end."
2,Generic?,This doesn't smell like the perfume you get in a fine department store. Smells like a generic or watered down version.
2,The bottle leaks,The perfume is awesome but I wanted this bottle for traveling and the top doesn't close tightly. I will use it up but only at home.
3,Questionable...,The bottle didnt look very full. If it was used prior I wouldnt be surprised. It was shipped timely which is always nice.
2,Not Authentic!,"I purchased this for my wife. Her is her take on the product: If you've never purchased this product, you're probably satisfied. I've enjoyed the fragrance, Amarige by Givenchy, for many years and previously purchased it through Macy's or other major department stores. Because of the price, I purchased it through Amazon and...what a mistake! It's definitely not the same AND it cannot be returned. Better to pay more and receive the original product."
4,Loved this perfume!,"Bought this for my mother since she loves this perfume so much. She couldn't find it anywhere where we live (DR) and so I proposed her to buy it through Amazon. Got here in perfect conditions but not when it was stated. But it's here and exactly what we ordered, so, no problem!"
1,the bingo game moves too fast hard to keep up with the numbers called,"product is ok, would not encourage the purchase of the game, however the senders of the game was prompt and correct on time of deliver"
2,Noisy and the wireless range is too short!,"Pros: We bought a DCT7488 because we like the ""do not disturb"" feature that Uniden has. The answering machine works very well, and the recording quality is great. The handset to handset conversations are very well handle.Cons: But our conversations are too noisy and the range of the mobile unit is really bad (if you have it in different floors of your townhouse you can barely speak well). On top, just a month after we had the system one of the handsets microphone does not work anymore, so people we talk to can barely hear us.Conclusion: We ended up returning the unit as the voice quality problem takes over any positive aspects of the system."
4,A good phone for home/home office,"I dropped my phone several times but still works. The sound, range, and battery life are average. In case the battery is weak, I am near the desk, or power failure, I use the corded unit. The batteries are NiMH so there is no memory problems like the old cadmium batteries. The price is right."
4,"you have met these characters, already...","I read this book in one ofternoon. It has mystery that will make you want to find out what happens next,and when you do, there's more to find out. The characters in this book are something else, and that Tray...read the book."
2,WHAT IS IT???,"I dont know what is it I see its called 2Pac cd...Aahahahaha!!Tupac is dead since 1996 and 2 discs or more are released each year with 2Pac name.Yeah, R U Still Down, Better Dayz and Until The End Of Time are great but they didnt find more Tupac never-heard songs to make money so now Eminem (he wants to be anywhere) released an album with his name...But who are featured??: G-Unit, Eminem, Elton John (WHAT???? A HOMO POP SINGER IN TUPAC CD??? WHAT'S HAPPEN???)...That's hilarious!They simply give the mic to 50 Cent, he raps, after with a vocal transformation program, they change his voice to Tupac's voice!I really think it's that because how can be so much songs of him never-heard? He stills alive?But I wanted this cd but I think it's another cd to makes money on him...Simply...So DON'T buy it!"
2,Eminem's 2Pac mixtape,"I don't like Em's music, so im not happy when i heard that the producer of this album is him. This is not a 2Pac album, i dont know why Afeni allowed for Em to produce her son's album. The remixes are good, and some tracks, but the OGs are the best, so try to get some original tracks!!!!!!!!!!"
3,OK,"As just a rap cd this is a great cd, but for a tupac cd its not. The beats just dont sounds like his. If you heard one of these songs on the radio, you might think ""hmm this is a good song"" but you would know that tupac didnt release it. One think I didnt like though was that eminem had to put himself into so many songs. ESPECIALLY Black Cotton, em definately shouldnt be on that track."
1,In all honesty this album is pure crap,"I'm a fan but i'm not a blind fan who would go out and buy anything; and personally I wont recommend this album to anyone, it is aweful. I'm only giving it 1 star because that's the lowest limit. The beats dont even come close to fitting with any of the lyrics...and no, i'm not Blindly agreeing with folks here.( if so many people say that the beats dont match there must be something in it).I would not even download this off the internet.This is the worst tupac album ever."
3,Not Bad But not Great,"all i have to say is this cd is a dissapointment but does have its songs but this cd should a better be the last after death pac cd because ever single one keeps getting worse and worse if the lyrics whent with the beat then it would be good but instead they speed pacs lyrics up to go with the beat plus inlclude people who should never of rapped or been on songs with pac are on here that all i have to say best songs for me where The uppercut,Thugs Get Lonely too,who do you love,Don't trust me, Hennessey"
3,"Em messed it up, big time.","Em shouldn't have produced this album, he shouldn't any. He's not a good producer. Dre, Just Blaze, Swizz Beats, Kanye, Scott Storch(should have produced more tracks) should have produced this album, NOT Em. I'm a HUGE Pac fan but didn't really feel this, all 'cause of Em.Fav 3 songs:Black CottonThe UppercutN.I.G.G.A."
1,"Loyal To The ""Lame""","This album is the king of lameness, obviously. Worst album of the year. Everything in this album is lame; this isn't what Tupac wanted to become. Get Haiku d'Etat's album ""Coup De Theatre"" if you want some real West-Coast Rap."
5,ANOTHER BAGIN ABLUM PROD. BY SLIM,SLIM MIGHT BE THE GREATES RAPPER OF ALL TIME. 2PAC IS THE BEST LYRICIST OF ALL TIME. B.I.G. AINT GOT NOTHIN ON 2PAC AND NEVER WILL. I WAS DOSSPOINTED BECAUSE I THOUGHT BONE THUGS-N-HARONY SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON THIS ALBUM. BEST TRACKS ARE BLACK COTTON AND LOYAL TO THE GAME.
3,its iight,"I'll have 2 say da same as all these people , when u listen 2 pac u feel him and 2 fans dat have been listenin 2 him 4 a minute kno him and da beats dat belong 2 him. But this album waznt him ,not close, but wen u got money like em u can get ur hands on wateva.But i still listen 2 it once in a while but yo da last track sound like Eazy-E but its Dj quick rite. anywayz i think this one aint a album 2 buy"
2,Where's the Heart?,"When I first heard Eminem's attempt at Tupac, I liked it. Who wouldn't? ""Hennessey"" has got to be the most instantly enjoyable songs ever produced. But there's one glaring error on this album: it's not Tupac. Where's the soulful beats? Where's the sympathetic awareness of the streets? Where's the anger? Tupac was not Ludacris, 50 Cent, or Lil' Wayne. He was a poet and a philosopher and a pioneer. This album sounds like number 8 on the Billboard Top 10."
5,2pac is still the best Rapper Out There.,2pac is still a very great rapper right next to Notorious B.I.G.Although this album has some flaws it is still a great albumfavorite tracks1.Ghetto Gospel2.Loyal to the Game3.Thugs Get Lonely Too
1,Eminem is a horrible producer,"Eminem is the worst producer I have ever heard, I know people that can make better beats for pac's music than him. This is a disgrace to Tupac's Music, his freedom of speech has been taken away by Eminem making him say ""G-Unit"" when Pac didn't even know who G-Unit or 50 Cent was. Don't Buy this cd if you love Tupac, Eminem is horrible and so is Interscope Records for letting this horrible cd even being Released. Thou Pac's lyrics are very nice I have heard remixes done by other people on Pac's fan sites.""Remember me, as an outcast OutlawAnother album out, that's what I'm about, moreGettin raw 'til the day I see my casketBuried as a G while the whole world remembers meUntil the end of time"" -2Pac R.I.P Best rapper/musician in the world"
1,Eminem F*** THis S*** Up,He f*** up da entire album. He also made pac say g-unit in da house. WTF is dat. Dis album is more like his own album. He b slowin down pac's acapella and speedin it up.
4,GOOD.... ALBUM.... BUT IT AINT THE PAC... THAT I HAD IN MIND,ITS A GOOD ALBUM... BUT IT AINT THE PAC I HAD IN MIND......2PAC WOULD OF NEVER DONE A ALBUM WITH A SNICTH.......... OR EMINEM.......... OR NE OF THE AFTERMATH/GUNIT/SHADY RECORDZ AND THAT....AND I DONT LIKE THAT WAY THEY MADE PACZ VOICE GO FASTER AND I DONT LIKE THE WAY THEY MAKE 2PAC SAY THESE PPL THAT HE NEVER KNEW... I MEAN.. HOW DID HE SAY G UNIT....5O.. EM... ETCI THINK THERE SHOULD BE ALL THESE GUEST APPERSENCEZ... THAT PAC NEVER KNEW...... PAC NEEDZ THE OUTLAWZ.. AND ALL THE PEOPLE HE KNEW.....I HATE 2 SAY IT......... BUT I THINK THAT 2PACZ MUM IS RUINING 2PACS LEGACY...................................
1,Worst Tupac album ever!!!,"This album in theory was always going to sound good with eminem producing it. However, in practice it didn't deliver the goods most fans had anticpated especially since the last real album was better days. In effect, the beats didn't match the words and it made tupac sound medicore which is not the case despite this album being good lyrically. The fact is it's not eminem's album it was Tupac's to his liking and style not Eminem's. It would've been better it was produced by those who had produced his Music while he was alive or those who really knew him because these days every Tom, Dick and Harry sounds like that they feeled for Tupac and knew him which is cowardly like Eminem. Personally, therefore I advise others not to be fooled by the hype and don't buy, instead if haven't already go for better Tupac albums."
1,THIS CD IS PROOF THAT 2PAC IS REALLY DEAD!,Until I heard This cd I thought that there was a chance brother Pac might still be with us... maybe hiding out in a witness protection program of sorts??? That would've made sense out of all the mysteries surrounding his untimely demise.The Tupac Shakur that I know (through his music only) would NEVER have allowed this crap be produced and sold to his fans with his name on it. Those that put this out (for whatever GREEDY CRACK'D up purpo$e) should be ashamed.R.I.P. Tupac... (I now have the closure needed to say that with confidence)
1,Straight garbage,"Pac has to be rolling in his grave on these posthumous releases. Why do they refuse to use the original beats on these songs. The original beats are so much better. I hate Eminem as a producer. He pretty much uses the same beat on every song here. He completely raped the beats on the classic songs Out on Bail and Loyal to the Game. For die-hard 2pac fans, I would suggest buying the mixtapes that include the original songs."
2,Not What It Could Have Been,F**k Eminem stop puttin Obe Trice and wack rappers on with Pac thiscd has some nice beats and Pac's Lyrics are Great as expectedbut his vocals are distroted and sped up and slowed down to match the beatsIf you are a Ultimate Pac fan like me you buy this cd because you feel like you have to but otherwise skip it
1,rubbish,"it seems all these new tupac albums are an insult to the legend himself, his lyrics are never below the best but the tunes and beats are jus remixed n utterly rubbish in my opinion, eminem you ought to stik with rapping rather than trying to make tunes for tupac, let the original producers do his music, rip tupac"
4,2pac is still going strong,"I gave this albulm 4 stars because although it is not the best albulm 2pac ever made, it is still very strong BEGINING TO END. Most of these tracks were produced by Eminem, and although the beats are nice they don't seem to fit 2pac's vocals. His lyrics from this record are still among the best in the game, however I thought there were too many cameos that might not have been on if 'pac had any say to it. Most of these songs are part of 2pac's party or aggressive style, and one thing that I missed hearing on this was his introspective side. Overall though, as a huge fan of 2pac, listening to this CD runs chills up my spine, and is a must own for any fan of music period."
3,Not too bad...,"It is 'pac, after all. I don't think the production of this album is up to par, though, and it's a shame, because there are some great verses on this disc. Some songs are produced well, but some beats just don't go with the vocals and/or lyrics. The slowing of some vocals makes them sound low and warped, and it's especially anoying because 2pac sounds so good upbeat.There are some jems on the album, though: I loved the remix of Hennessy, and Thug for Life and Black Cotton are pretty damn good.Another note is that there is unwelcome number of verses by other people than 2pac. G-Unit, though not bad on this album, are not up to the par of the Outlawz, the group appearing on the majority of the newer 2pac CD's.If you're a big fan of 2pac, I would reccomend picking this up, but it's definatley not one of the better 2pac albums."
1,"tupac fan, but this is crap","As soon as i heard eminem being the producer, my hopes went down, i heard all of the cd and i really was disappointed. Whatever happened to the hardcore tupac that we all used to know ? Anyways, this beats eminem put straight up suck. Tupac would never feature eminem, because he lacks in talent. I know he took a lot of his time making this cd, but it was just a waste of time. My opinion is that he just wanted money and he knew people would buy a new 2pac cd, no matter what. So as a tupac fan to another, please dont bother with this cd, its really disappointing. In summary, these beats and rythem are not good at all."
1,No.,"All I can say this is one of worst albums in tupac's collection. If you were a true 2pac fan, you will stick to the albums released before he died and stay away from the rest. What a shameful disgrace to the greatest rapper of all time. I cant believe this album was even allowed to be released. Just another case of someone profiting off tupac's name. This CD was released so that the studio could gain money from purchases.Avoid."
2,completely ruined 2pac's tracks,"i was sadly disappointed with this album, i though eminem could have made a great album but he lost 2pac's original sound and incorporated too much of his own style, which lately (with Encore) has been goin down the drain. i never thought id say this but this is a horrible 2pac album."
1,Eminem Destroys A Legend,I'm a huge 2Pac fan and have all of his albums but I can't support this one. The production and mixing by Eminem is some of the worst I have ever heard. There are probably only two good songs on this album and that's a shame because lyrically this is a very good album. I'm dissapointed that Afeni would let an artist that Pac probably would have never worked with do a whole album of his. This album won't tarnish his legacy but it doesn't do it any service. Hopefully we don't have endure another Eminem production of 2Pac's music.
2,Why?,"not only does the cd suck but they even have a ""lookalike"" on the cd cover. lol i wounder if its even 2 pac on the cd. let him RIP"
3,well I'm surprised,"I didn't think the album was bad, and I would have given it three and a half stars if I could. I love hearing Pac again, but apparently these songs aren't unreleased or new because there were original versions on soundtracks and what not. I'm definitely gonna go seek out the original versions, but I don't think this CD was bad at all. Eminem's production is a little awkward on this album, but I think it's good for the most part. I like some of the last tracks a lot tho. Scott Storch, Red Spyda and DJ Quik did a pretty good job. I will say that Eminem should have just crafted the beats around Pac's lyrics and it might have been better with the Outlawz on tracks over G-Unit, thought I don't think G-Unit is bad. I'm surprised so many people hate this album tho. I guess I'll see how the original versions of these songs sound and that might help me understand why so many people are hatin on this album. 1"
1,Pac would NEVER rap to these beats!,"MAN I'm disgusted with this album. As a REAL Pac fan, I know he would never put his voice to these whack beats! Eminem sucks as a producer. This album sounds like an Eminem soundtrack with Pac's voice on it. I don't even think Pac would've even worked with Eminem in the first place. Just listen to any of Pac's joints before he passed and I dare any REAL Pac fan to say he's fall off like this. I'm definetly giving this cd away! After I wrote this review I read some of the other reviews and was totally disgusted that anyone could like this crap! Pac would never flow with Obie Trice or Eminem for that matter! Eminem has to be the worst hiphop producer around! I mean let's be, The only joints that REAL heads will even consider bangin on a Eminem album are the few produced by Dre. This cd is a disgrace to Pac legacy. Saying that you like this album is like being poor or even working middle class and voting for George Bush. You'd have to be a moron!!!!"
2,Make It Stop,"Why are they butchering Pac's songs like this. I advise anyone to get the bootlegs over this album. The original Ghetto Gospel and Loyal To The Game are 2 of my favorite Pac songs but the one's on here are painful to listen to. Afeni should have let DJ Quik, Daz, and whoever else that worked with Pac do this album. They should have just digitally remastered the bootlegs. This started with Still I Rise to Until The End Of Time to Better Dayz and the quality has been going down and down and they hit rock bottom with this one. The 2 stars is 1 because it is Pac and another for the song Uppercut. The most obvious butcher job is Black Cotton where Em chose a fast beat and you could tell he is trying to speed up Pac's rhyme. I hope they do better with this last album due out this year."
3,2Pac Is Back!,"Another album from 2Pac, he has more albums out after his death which is amazing. About the CD, Loyal to the Game is like a mix of gangsta rapper Pac with mainstream beats. This CD which many think, is more of an Eminem CD. The beats are too ""Eminem"" and mainstream. Like a lot of people say, if Pac was alive today, he probably wouldn't use these mainstream beats, heck he proabably wouldnt even collab with eminem and his shady/aftermath/g-unit crew. but that is to argue. this cd is good but the lyrics are the typical songs of Pac about struggles, being a gangsta and all that stuff. I personally like this CD with the gangsta-ness and the mainstream beats, and catchy hooks. but again if you have heard pac's old songs it is totally different from this eminem produced album. but again just buy it and support this guy. i like that song with Dido on the hook and ""thugs get lonely too"" and thug 4 life."
1,Em is tarnishing pacs legacy......,"This is pathetic. This is nothing pac would do. If pac were living today he would be ashamed of this album. First of all this cd is ruined by all of the stupid members of g-unit on basically every song. Secondly the beats are nothing pac would rap over. Thirdly why would you [...]around with pacs lyrics and make him say stupid [...] like 'G-unit!' Pac would never say stupid sh*t like that. And all of these guests appearances are pathetic because pac would never feature half these people on his cd. Em, you know nothing about west coast rap. If you want pacs legacy to live on great, but let someone like dre produce the cd because you are just tarnishing pacs legacy. You ruined pacs lyrics with your horrible beats, and you just butchered every damn track because g-unit is on almost every track. And although you claim pac would ""roll with you"" I highly doubt that."
3,my thoughts,PERSONALLY I THINK EM MESSED THE WHOLE CD UP BECAUSE HE COULDN'T FIND A BEAT TO MATCH 2PAC'S VOICE. SO HE SLOWED DOWN THE TEMPO AND MESSED IT UP.
2,turnin in his grave,"This should of never been made. Eminem has turned pac into a shady aftermath member, with similar repetive beats. I am sure that,, if Pac was alive-he would never be rapping with Obie Trice- most Pac fans would like an album made to the style of Pac not Eminem and G-unit.i have been harsh, but i was very disapointed with this albumi have nly found one song i like-Ghetto Gospel--elton john sample(round of applause for this)"
1,not heard cd,"i have not heard this cd, but i believe letting eminem produce a Tupac cd is not right at all. Tupacs music never sounded like D-12 or G-unit, and you Pac would not have done sh** with them, or JadaKiss(who is on the album) eminem can produce, for his other groups, but not for Pac, just because he respects, he gets executive producer for the album. I respect tupac to, i want to be executive producer. The people who originally produced Tupacs music should be brought in to once again produce his music, not eminem."
1,"Pac died 8 years ago, but Eminem's killing his legacy","Eminem and 50 Cent spent so much time dissing Ja Rule for being a wanabe 2Pac, but they are ruing all of 2Pac's songs.The entire CD is remixed. No tracks they way Pac wrote them. No original beats. The tempo is changed from the original. They change words to make him say things he never said, like ""G-Unit!!"" and ""Drop that, Em"". 2Pac would not have wanted this CD released the way it was. If you want Loyal to the Game, buy the cassette of the ""Above the Rim Soundtrack"". Or buy the Makaveli collection on Ebay to get the songs in their orginal form.This album is the worst 2Pac album period. Even worse than the Nu-Mixx Classics (another poorly remixed album). The only reason I bought it is cause I have all the other ones. I would not recommend this CD. Buy any other 2Pac CD before this one."
1,Save your dough!!!,"I for one am a huge 2Pac fan and when I heard a new CD was coming out I was excited! But after hearing this ""album"" I am so dissapointed. Most of the beats were by Eminem and although I dont hate Eminem I cant stand what he did with his executive producer position on this CD! He slowed down 2Pac's vocals, Sped up 2Pac's vocal, and cut-n-pasted words together to make 2Pac say things like ""Obie"", ""Em"", ""G-Unit"", and more. Some of the voals on this CD are sped up so much that 2Pac sounds like he is twelve years old (refer to ""A Crooked N**ga Too [The Eminem Version]""! No lie! If you buy this CD all it will do is tell Amaru / Interscope that you will pay for a Tupac CD no matter what they do to it. I know we all love Tupac but take a stand for Tupac and remind the powers that be that we want 2Pac the way 2Pac wanted to present it to us! The only song worth listening to on this whole CD is ""Loyal To The Game"" produced by Dj Quikk. Do yourself a favor and leave this one in the store."
1,How dare they degrade Tupac's work,"I always enjoyed all the posthumous albums Tupac's legacy has released, but this time they have gone to far! This is a total disgrace to Tupac's memory. There is no way in hell that Tupac would role with 50 Cent or Eminem, and now their doing this project. Total digrace. They've been messing with his vocals making them sound awful, putting themselves on the songs and making him say G Unit. I just don't get why they don't just release the originals, this is bulls***. Its just more easy money for greedy producers. Do not support this, if you want to support Tupac's legacy than pick up one of the classics -2pacalypse Now, Strictly For My N.I.G.G.A.Z. Thug Life, Me Against The World, All Eyez On Me, The Don Killuminati, R U Still Down or Greatest Hits. Do not buy this crap, cop the originals and you'll see how terribly they've messed up. I pray that soon they will just let Mr Shakur rest in peace."
3,Alright...,"I was reading reviews while sampling this album and somethin rubbed me real wrong...""Appreciate this for what it is. Don't listen to hear Pac 9 years ago. Listen and think about Pac in 2005. He would be right here and doing just what everybody else is doing. Granted he would be alot better than the rest, but I think he'd fit in just fine.""I mos def. disagree... Pac would NEVER rap over whack @$$ beats like this... he would never collab with Em or Jada... He'd slap 50 cent all the way back down to Nickel... and he'd still be ridin on Dr. Dre... The beef wouldnt be over. So many people were makin money off his beefs with Eastcoast, Dr. Dre, and everyone else...I hate these new Pac Albums... hell I dont have to listen to new Pac, his lyrics still hold strong. Pop in all eyez on me... and roll up a blizzunt... and just chill..."
1,WILL IT EVER STOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I think all this 2pac music is just phoney. Because 2pac fakedhis death is just a scam to getmoney. I hate anybody who thinksthat Hes still alive. Plus thats not even his voice if youreally listen to it. They had like 9 albums put out thatweren't produced, FAAAKE!!!!!! I think they have Tecnologyto change the voice. Afeni Shakeur did a real good job keepinghis name alive. It's just that gay eminem F**king all thetracks up. Eminem cannot produce west coast music, face it Em YOUSUCK!!!!!!! I think they should leave 2pac(A.K.A Makaveli)Alone.And let him Rest in piece."
1,100% Trash. I hope this is the last CD.,"I wish I could've give the CD 0 stars. The best beat on the cd, produced by Eminem, is ""Loyal 2 The Game."" 2Pac only has one verse on the song! It's G-Unit feat. a clip of 2pac. It should have had 2 verses by 2pac and 1 verse by the outlawz. That song sums up the entire CD - fake & uninspired. Its a marketing ploy to get street cred for Eminem and G-Unit with 2pac fans.The last good posthumous 2Pac CD was ""Until The End of Time."" Johnny J and DJ Quick all did a wonderful job on the beats and the entire cd felt as if a lot of thought was put into it. This just sounds like Eminem was messing around in his recording studio with 2Pac acapellas.Listen to 2Pac's ""Ghetto Gospel"" w/ Akon and you will hear a version 10X better than the one on the CD. Why couldn't they have used that?Afeni should be ashamed of herself. Go back to Jose Johnny J ""The Cuban Militant"" (as 2pac called him) for beats, or go home. Don't waist your money on this cd."
3,2pac is Back!!!,"Just picked this cd up and its tight! Yes, as you heard there are alot of songs that eminem screwed up and its true, there are some songs that your going to want to skip... Other then that this cd is good, i wouldnt rate this next to his other cd's but its good listen.... Its 2pac still:)"
3,F*ck Eminem forever,"How could Eminem do this to 2pac? This just shows his selfishness to promote himself and his crappy label. Someone should sue him for the disgrace of 2pac's name. And shame on Afeni for letting it happen. Thank God for 2pac's voice and lyrical genius. To Eminem: Don't slow down Pac, don't speed up Pac, don't make it seem like Pac is saying something he's not, and don't cut out his words. You've tarnished the image of my childhood hero. I hope you OD on yourself. P.S. Your Encore cd makes a good coaster for my beer."
3,Not even bad production can stop Pac,"Despite the first 13 traks sounding like one looooong song, Pac's rage power and emotion still shines. The Pac sound alike ad libbin is very unneccessary but the jewels of this cd are the last four traks which include a Loyal to the Game remix that you can appreciate next to the classic joint from the Above the Rim soundtrak which was desecrated earlier on the lp. DJ Quik (a producer Pac actually knew and worked with) adds that soul element that is missing throughout the first 13 traks and it features one of Pac's road dawg's Big Syke."
2,2nd review...still 2 stars...read liner notes,"In the cd notes, Afeni claims that she went to Marshall because he was offered to work for free...oh boy.Well, all I can say is: YOU GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR.She wouldnt go to Dre, Johnny J, Easy Mo Bee, the Quik, or anyone else because they charged money.COME ON! The original tracks were already made and sounded great! The way Pac wanted them to. Some were unfinished, perhaps, however that could have been fixed without redoing everything Shady style.and If you want Pac's friends to remix his songs in his tradition, you'd bloody well must pay them! After all, Pac did! And these guys have to eat too! Eminem has enough cash, so he can affored to work for free.Once again, it shows Eminem worked for free.The result: 2pac ""fast-food style""...straying away from his legacy."
2,2 stars for PAC's standards,"The cd has tight-azz rhymes that only pac can deliver. No death row Makaveli-era tracks. See 2pac at his purest non-gangsterized, and activist self.That alone is reason to buy the cd.But the production is the typical 8-Mile Soundtrack style known to be used by Eminem and crew.Pac would've never used such beats and would rather have done it himself.Way too far-fetched for my tastes. Afeni went too far on this one. Lots of the beats do not even match his rap style.I say a) go out and buy the bootlegs of rhe ORIGINAL versions of his songs to get the real feel.b) lets push Afeni to release his tracks as meant to be heard.or c) release cd's mixed ONLY by producers who've worked with PAc in the past: Johnny J, Quik, Easy Mo B, Shock G, Daz, Dre. etc...buy this cd used."
2,Horrible!,"This CD is a disgrace to loyalty!I like the beats Eminem made, but they didnt fit the vocals. He either slowed down or sped up Tupac's voice to match whatever beats he wanted to use.Ghetto Gospel is one of the worst songs on the whole album. The voice is so slowed down and more than 70% of it is missing from the original, whats up with that?Not to mention in the song Loyal To The Game. He takes out the 2 original people and adds G-Unit? What the ****? All that song sounds like is mis-matching verses that have nothing in common.Don't buy it, it isnt worth it. If you REALLY want it, download it, but don't give Tupac's mother any money. I can't believe she allowed this to happen. This is the worst CD ever put out in Tupac's name."
1,I Would rather listen to Nelly and Fat Joe than this trash.,"Loyal to the Game No StarsI Would rather listen to Loyalty, Jealous Ones Still Envy, & Country Grammer over the ugliest, most incomprehensible posthumous 2pac album I've ever seen, this disaster has terrible beats throughout, the writing is horrible, the lyrics are truly a mess(although 2pac's lyrics are better than the album deserves) and the feminem's mixing of gay-unit in the album is completely horrendous, this is a truly horrible and a sad disgrace to the great legendary tupac shakur, not only this album made my list as the single worst album of last year, but also this one is on my list of the worst albums of the last 5 years.This is a completely, absolutely horrible album.I Don't feel sorry for afeni shakur, she has her own self to blame for this mess.R.I.P. 2Pac, you will never be forgotten and never will be.A Truly Big Thumbs Down for Me on this album."
2,"Eminem with some more trademark, no spark, beats","where do I start, Eminem's production has completely ruined pacs reputation and legacy as a rapper. His beats lack any real diversity or musical quality. Worse than this, his sub-standard beats are all too similar. Eminem should not have even been near this project. Don't get me wrong, I respect eminem as a rapper, but in this case he should have been tied in a straight jacket so that he could not touch the mixer."
3,Average.....,"The album is not as bad as most people say it is. I've heard alot worse. Some things I did not like about this album was Eminem's production. It just doesn't not fit with 2Pac's lyrics. And I hate it when new artist rap in his post-death albums. And I hated it when Eminem made 2Pac say ""G-Unit""."
1,Tupac's Work Exploited.,"Although working with a very talented porducer(Eminem), this album failed to capture Tupac's living days. It was as if eminem was making an album for himself and just threw a bunch of Pac's rhymes over it. The best songs areOut On BailHennessey(Remix) Feat. Sleepy Brown/Produced by Red SpyderPo Nigga Blues - Produced By Scott StorchI Couldn't believe that Eminem could be so selfish to put out this crap. While he'll make money off of Pac. Tupac's fans and his music will suffer. It was the wosrt Pac album I ever heard."
2,Dear Mama...,"These new release/same old material projects of 2pacs just keep getting worse and worse. Mama pac should stop signing off on the release and give it up. All of the vocals sound tremendously slowed down just to fit these beats which all sound like mediocre shady/aftermath beats at best...applaud Em for taking on the task single-handedly of trying to keep immortalizing one of his idols, Pac, but then stop clapping, clench a fist and knock him out for poor production. This cd sucks... but then i started to wonder, have any of Pacs cd's ever been great. He's not the greatest anything of all-time, just overhyped...He's not a true MC/rapper, his flow never changes, put him in a circle with biggie, jay, Em and he'd suffer in a freestyle battle. Make some more poetry books or something. Please, no more cd's."
4,2Pac alive !!!!!,"Many are saying that 2Pac didnt know or wouldnt hate Eminem and Obie Trice if he were still here, but that is where they are sadly mistaken. Listen to ""Out On Bail"" (Track 3)and you will hear Tupac say ""drop that s*** Em"" refering to Eminem and he also calls out Obie Trice by saying ""my n**** O Trice"". Last but not least ""Loyal To The Game"" he says ""G-Unit's in this muthaf***a"". If anyone had common sense they would know Eminem,G-Unit and Obie Trice were underground when 2Pac was alive and there is no way they could have known each other."
5,Loyal to the Game,"First of all, i would like to say that it is great to see two of the greatest artists combining together to form this album. Many claim that Eminem had ""ruined"" unreleased 2Pac material, yet i cannot see how he has done so. For example, the song ""Soldier Like Me"" - that is an excellent song. What more do 2Pac fans want? What were they expecting? Nevertheless, the beats are incredibly good and there is a wide variety. I honestly am a fan of every single song on the album, particularly ""Soldier Like Me"" and ""Uppercut"".J- Vidi's Top Songs* Soldier Like Me* Uppercut* Loyal To The Game* Black Cotton* Thugs Get Lonely Too* A Crooked Too"
4,Solid album,"this is not the best from Makaveli, but it was a good release, and was one of the top releases during 04. It had some real good beats, but the apperarances are very disappointing. Even though they gave good performances, they have no right to be on the album, except the Outlawz. Also they should of made it a double disk, one disk for the original material and apearances, and the other for the 04 version."
1,CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"All I have to say is that if 2pac was alive today he would not work with phonies like Eminem and G Unit. The album should've featured only people that actually worked with pac in the past. I can't believe Afeni Shakur would even agree to let Eminem produce a 2pac album, and let that snitch 50 cent rhyme on a track with pac?????? what was she thinking. Well this is not a real 2pac cd if you want real Pac try checking All Eyez on Me or Makaveli: The 7 Day Theory!!!! Peace. 2pac for Life"
2,Enminem's beats wreck everything good,"Afeni Shakur knew her son better than any of us ever will, and I know Afeni had some input on the beats as an executive producer, but damn they just do not fit pac's style. This cd just doesn't have the feel of previous tupac classics.Eminem is just a flat out awful producer on this cd and wrecks tupac's lyrics. In fact, Eminem's own cd's also steadily got even more worse with the more control he took from Dr. Dre as producer. Eminem wrecked himself with his own beats as well."
2,It;s not that bad...oh yeah it is,"Being a HUGE 2Pac fan, I was hyped when I heard the initial guest producers for this album being rumored: Kanye West, Just Blaze, Dre, and Johnny J. However, Eminem produced all but 4 songs, (the best songs on the album by far) and really distored them, not with the beats or guest artists, but by slowing down Pac's vocals and essentially underminding the essence of the music.Buy this CD anyways for the track produced by Scott Scortch"
2,wth is this,when i bought this cd today i thought it was gonna be hot cuz its pac but man was i wrong.Eminem shouldve never been allowed to produce any of pacs work maybe one or two songs on the album but he gets to do the whole thing....afeni shoulda told him heeeeellllllll no cuz em really did a horrible job cuz none of pacs rhymes go good with ems wack production.So do urself a favor and dont buy this.
3,disappointed..not what i was looking for,"When I heard that there was a new Pac cd comin out, I got reall excited n evrything, but when I heard the album, I was very disappointed. Pacz lyricz is nice n erythin, but I was surprised that Afeni would let Eminem produce the whole album. I despise Eminem bcuz he always kicks freestylez to pacz beatz n sumtimez steals his lyrics. I also hate 50 cent..especially cuz on hail mary remix 2004 50 basically used everyone of pacz f***in lyrics from hail mary and against all odds. Plus some of the songz on the cd are just pacz different lyrics mixed together to make a verse. It is a must have if u r a hardcore pac fan..but i was kind of disappointed."
4,Pretty Good I Guess,"Loyal To The Game is alright, I just felt Eminem used too much of his own style when he made the actual music thoughCrooked N***a Too (remix), and Loyal To The Game (DJ Quick remix) were better though, they were more 2Pac's styleAll in all, It's alright."
2,dont let eminem work with pac's stuff again!!!!!,if for anything else 2apc has been loved is for the beats in his songs.them beats are the bomb. pacs lyrics are the best of all but if eminem is going to put some crappy beats it aint going to work like it used toeminem dont mess around with pacs stuff againr.i.p tupac amaru shakur
3,Orion Paden,"I am a true Pac fan. This album is ok, but I've listen tobetter like ""All Eyes on Me,"" and ""Me Against The World.""That's just a coupled I've named, but if you are a truePac fan, then it wouldn't hurt to add ""Loyal to the Game""to the collection."
1,How dare Feminem!,"I would suggest to any loyal Pac fan, not to buy this album! Theres only a few good tracks on there (Maybe ghetto gospel was good but the ones Em didn't produce were the best tracks like Loyal to the game Dj quik remix) But don't you dare buy this album. I would never buy another feminem album after this [...] producing and putting Fiddy and other artist pac would NEVER work with. Sounds more like a Feminem album. Feminem had the audacity to make Pac say (G-Unit).I heard that they are making another Pac album (Shakurspeare) well if they are going to have songs with artist that Pac NEVER worked with,I'm not going to buy it and once again Feminem,Fiddy,The Gayme are going to be featured on there!Why does Pacs mother keep putting these untalented artist on here.If that album comes out,I'm just going to download songs I want off amazon.I won't download tracks that features Feminem,Fiddy,and The Gayme or any producing by Feminem."
3,Not top-knotch Pac,"Decent price, came on time. Don't expect this CD to be as good as the other 2Pac albums."
1,A sad day in music,"This is the worst Pac CD ever. What was Eminem think or hearing? Who let him get out of the studio with this crap. Most of the beats are the musical version of a cartoon. Some things are better left alone. Pure trash!!! Most of the people who are giving this CD high marks admit they don't listen to rap/Pac. So they are clueless. They just won't understand what the outrage is about. Go and finish listening to your Chingy.Eminem is just riding the coat tail of a legend. I'm gonna end it there, I can go on and on... I'm gonna be sick."
3,Worst Pac CD Ever,"First of all, this IS the WORST Pac CD out par with Resurrection. The speed was toned a whole lot down to match Eminem's beats. His beats are nice no doubt, but its not solid and by that it doesn't fit Pac's strong voice. The songs are really short too compared to what Pac released earlier in the mid-90's so you can tell there was A LOT of lyrical cuts. Of course like always the lyrics are bomb and they are second to none but everything just doesn't fit in place. Much love to Afeni and Em, but what they did with this album is literally DESTROYING the LEGACY Tupac built. I love Pac very much to the fullest, but I have to say this album incredibly sucked. I expected much better."
2,EMINEM! STOP MESSING WITH PAC'S MUSIC IT SUCKS!,"I have all 2-PAC bootleg cds or songs! and they are bumpin!eminem should stop messing with the best, and, god of rap ever!music. pac wouldnt like a white guy messing with his beats. i have the real beats and, they sound way better than the ones people or eminem came out with they sound like crap. [...] if u want the real beats buy the bootleg ones that came out back then thats the best music ever!pac is the best noone will ever be him or get close to be him RIP PAC! we LOVE U! WE MISS U!wish u where here so u could put a stop to eminem messing up your music![...]"
1,It Cant get any worse then this can it?,I have been listening to pac for years this has got to be his worst album to date. Eminem ruined the beats whilst you have artists featured on the tracks that pac did not even know e.g 50 cent and i think if he were alive he would not make songs with fake artists such em and 50. JJ didint have anything to produce on the album i dont really know wtf afeini is trying to do.
1,disrespecting to TUPAC,"I' 2pac fan by ten year i have all tupac cd's but i can't buy this album because this is not tupac albums,this album like eminem album & tupac just featuring on this album,whut's goin on where is pac's real producers johonny j,daz ,big d,tony pizzaro & others ,i wanna orginal version this songs... Where is tupac real friends westcoast rappers,Mrs Afeni whut r u doin ? if tupac alive today he dont wanna workin with eminem & his crew ,i'm so sad, tupac destroyed for the money,this is SHAME!"
2,Eminem Took a DUMP on Pac's Memory,"Shame!!! Stick with screwing up your own music, please. You wanna make pacman beats? Make them over your next song about your baby's momma. Leave my boy Pac alone."
4,Just wanna hear Pac,"I have been a Tupac fan from the begining and as a true fan I just like to hear him rap whether it's good beats or bad beats I just like to hear Tupac SPEAK!!!! I have never been into alot of beats or sounds the Neptunes for example or that stuff from down South. I have always listened to what the artist had to say, Kanye West, The Roots, Nas, Tupac, and Grandmaster Flash to name a few. If you are listening to Tupac for beats then this album is probably not for you, but if you want to hear some music with substance listen to what he's saying."
4,"An Opinion On ""Loyal To The Game""","On one of 2Pac's websites, they encourage 2Pacs fans not to purchase the new album ""Loyal To The Game"" because of the fact that 2Pacs lyrics were messed with either slowed down or by making him say ""G-Unit"", ""Drop that beat Em"", and ""Jada"" as in Jadakiss. If Pac was alive it would never cross his mind to do a song with any of the artists that are featured on the album except for the Outlaws. I still listen to the album every day but skip tracks once 2Pacs verses are over. Overall its a good album because whatever 2Pac creates is genius. R.I.P. 2Pac!"
3,WOULD 2PAC REALLY LET EMINEM PRODUCE HIM???,"This cd is only ""alright""! And the only reason its ""alright"" cuz it features Tupac. Thats is not really cuttin it, you have to ask yourself one question - would Pac really let eminem produce him? I mean C'mon.... EMIMEN PRODUCING TUPAC'S SONGS LYRICS AND STYLE!!!! R U SERIOUS? Compare your favorite Pac Cd to this one and it does come close. Its a coo cd if you like G-unit and them guys I guess. Im disappointed In Afini. I'm a die hard 2pac fan, but only if its ""TRUPAC""(TRU-PAC:WHEN HE WAS ALIVE)."
3,Tupac Fan's Listen Up,I respect everyone that worked on the album because they are only trying to keep the name of tupac shakur alive. i have to say that this album is not like all eyes on me in beat wise or any other shakur album.the best tracks are14. Po Nigga Blues [Scott Storch Remix]15. Hennessey [Red Spyda Remix]16. Crooked Nigga Too [Raphael Saadiq Remix17. Loyal to the Game [DJ Quik Remix]even tho the album lacks...tupac fans just let it slide and dont hate
4,Someone play Ether for Black Spade,"I read where someone said hip hop was DEAD. If hip hop is dead why are listening to albums and spending your time reviewing them. Someone play Ether or Dear Summer for this lost child. I listened to this album and Em's beats are very good and in some cases are hotter than lava rocks. So what if they sped up Pac's voice or slowed it down a bit. You critics sitting around finding reasons to downgrade the culture need to find a cliff and leap. If you don't enjoy it, don't try to destroy it. Album's bangin Em. See you in a minute Pac. Leave some mashed potatoes for me Big. Who am I? NUNYA"
3,They should of Let dat Nigga Daz do It,"Daz is one of the best producers of all time and he does not get alot of credit for it, he did alot of Tupacs beats when he was on Death Row. I guess we finally ended the rumor of weather Tupac is alive or dead bcoz there is no way he would let this hit the streets if he was alive with all the fackers on it."
1,Whats the definiton of Real?,First and foremost i didnt like this album. I love pac but eminem went overboard with the production in my opinon and the beats jus get tired and repetitive. Second everyone talking bout all these rappers nowadayz aint real. True alot of them are a flash in the pan but if u think that being a rapper u have 2 kill people and do drugs then you dont know what real is and thats defintiely not all that 2pac was. Very diappointing
3,Is this album for Eminem or Tupac Fans or Shady Records?,"Throughout this entire Pac album there is alot of shout outs to Shady Records and Eminem so is the production of this album promoting Pac or Eminem and Shady Records.If you listen to the albums Makaveli,R U Still Down,Until the End of Time does anybody hear any shout outs to any other record label like Shady Records or anything....No!I am a fan of Eminem and I believe he is a very talented and skilled artist with unbelievable flows but this album sounds too much like Eminem.Don't get me wrong but this album is good but is this really Pac!I truly believe that if Pac were still alive he would still be delivering to the fans those true gangsta rhymes and beats that you can ride too and stuff.Until the end of time nobody will ever know if Pac would have worked with Eminem or even alot of this mainstream artists these days.Picture Pac Rollin not is his car but in his grave right now wondering why his lyrics are being toyed with like this."
1,What The Hell?,"It's Sad...How Afeni Shakur Put Out Album After Album...And Then Snapping..Making Eminem A Producer (Bad Decision) And Putting G-Unit On The Album!!!!!!! (Even Worse Decision} Is It My Imagination Or Did They Make Pac Say 'G-Unit'? I Hope It's My Imagination because About 60% of The People Who Bought This CD Bought It Just So They Can Actually Hear 50 & Company On A Track With Pac (Which If Pac Was Alive, Would Never Have Happened!!)Buy His Earlier Albums Instead"
1,GO BACK TO THE GHETTO EMINEM!!!!!!!,"It is impossible for me to understand why this slimy piece of sh*t was trusted to carry on the legacy of hip hop's greatest legend. If Pac was alive he'd be spittin all over this lousy attempt by Eminem to fit in to the black community. Tupac had like 250 songs in his short and triumphant career compared to bad ass Shady's 4 songs. Even Pac's worst songs stomp all over eminem's most prominent hits. In fact, he could write better songs from his grave than Eminem can alive. The only Eminem song that kind of made sense was: Coming out of the closet, and that's just because it gave an accurate description of that transsexual queerbait. That dude thinks he's a crazy muthaf**ka cause he's from Detroit, well I'll tell you what... the only thing more rotten from Detroit is their lame ass basketball team. WESTSIDE!!!!!!!!!RIP PacP.S. Biggie sucks too!"
1,Not a worthy purchase!,"2pac did not have wisdom regarding the truth about the 5 Percent Nation because he was blindly by material visions such as the newest rolex and the newest Gucci or Versace suit. 2pac was simply not able to come to the realization about the important truths inherent within the 5 Percent Nation that might have given him something to pursue, rather than simply attempting to capture the ""American Dream"". I urge you not to make the mistake of purchasing this album!"
1,Another wack album by a wack dead rapper,"This album is wack and 2pac was a wack rapper who was over-hyped by the media (newspapers and magazines). The undeniable fact is that 2pac was a weak rapper who had about as much raw talent as Vanilla Ice. In fact, I am pretty sure that Vanilla Ice would rip 2pac in a freestyle battle because Pac's lyrics sounded like a 3rd grader. Anyways, feel free to buy this album if you wantto waste $15."
1,wutever...Loyal to what game ?,"2pac to me was the worse rapper and i never was into his weak music even tho it did sell but it was still weak and if i ever seen diz punk on my street? I would b sure to handle it. Dont buy 2pac's ""loyal to the game"" coz 1 feminem produced diz crap and 2 ? Its wack like pac always was... F*ck 2pac !"
1,wtf,"why aint ja rule on loyal to tha game w/o ja rule it aint so thug life. 2pac isnt a huge thug, he is a wannabe gangsta and u 2pac fans r just jealous of ja rule. just because hes enemies with 2pac doesent mean hes bad he is betta than 2pac anyday. btw am i da only one here from iowa?"
1,WTF??,"This is obviously the worst album that afeni (not pac) has put out.Ive lost repesct for her, which is pretty damn sad. I cannot believe she allowed eminem to produce this album!?I give this album 0 stars out of 5.R.I.P tupac shakur and R.I.P Marshall Mathers"
5,A Cowboy Book like None Other!!,"This book is for all types of readers. It will especially pique the interest of cowboys and rodeo fans that don't normally like to read. I read everyday, from Danielle Steele to Stephen King and this is up to their level. The author is able to describe a scene so you feel like your actually the one doing it, without dragging on and on. I did not put this book down from start to finish. He has a way of ending a chapter so you cann't wait to read the next. I am currently rereading it to get more indepth, because the first time I couldn't wait for the end. Way to Go!! This is a wonderful book!!"
1,Made in China piece of crap!,"""Obviously a returned item from another dissatisfied customer, scratches, bent, and the bolt to open the tire swing was broken off (which is probably why it was returned in the first place). The tire carrier came a week after I already had installed the bumper. This item was ""made in China"", very poor quality, and cheesy construction. Save yourself the headache and just buy a Warren bumper, they are made in the USA (Oregon), and quality with excellent customer service. This ""S*itty built"" bumper is exactly that, a piece of Chinese made junk!"
2,looks good but does not fit properly,Very complicated to install. The template they give you to drill out the holes in frame to mount bumper does not work. Spare Tire mount did not even latch until I modified. Grease fitting for spare tire mount hits tail gate when opening. You also have to remove fuel tank completely from vehicle to install bumper.
3,Formula needs some fine-tuning.,"They have made ID too watered down. Right out of the container it doesn't have the ability to maintain the lubricating film of protection between moving parts. (When the squeeze is on, ID is wiped away) But, we've found that if you spread it where you want it and let it air-dry (blow-dry)for about two minutes, that it thickens it enough to provide the perfect viscosity and it will then stay adhered to the parts in motion without being wiped off of the parts that need protecting.)"
3,"Nice, good-looking, but a bit misleading","While I used this book and kit to do my first mehndi, I disliked the cone applicator used in the kit. I did like the transfers that were included, although no information was offered on how to make your own transfers. The information on how to do your own freehand designs was also nice, and the henna was good-quality. The reason I say it was misleading is that the information was presented in a ""this is the only way"" style, and the resources listing in the back gave you the impression that Halawa Henna was the exclusive source for henna. And don't rely on getting your questions answered from Halawa - they'll just tell you to shell out a couple hundred bucks for their classes, and all questions will be answered. Overall, the kit is good for a first-time experience, but get your questions answered at www.mehandi.com, and order replacement supplies at www.castleart.com (I am not affiliated in any way with either)."
4,Wonderful,"A big group of friends and I tried out this kit together and we had wonderful results. The henna went a very long way, much more so than I had expected. We had to mix a little water into the cones because they were a little too thick, but the rest of it worked great. You will want to reenforce the sides of the cones with tape before you start, because no matter what the seams (they are shaped zip lock bags) eventually give with the force of pushing the henna though the cone. We all had wonderful, dark orange results two and a half hours later. Leave the henna on longer than the author suggests, until it is mostly flaking off by itself (say 2 and a half to 3 hours).Good luck!"
2,"Not impressive, overall...","Although the book is very pretty, and contains some really nice designs, the henna kit was extremely disappointing. I followed the directions to a tee, and got very disappointing results as did all but one of my friends at my Henna party. Not recommended."
5,Buying for the second time,"I liked this kit so much last summer that I'm purchased another for this summer. The amount of henna in the kit looks small, but as they say...a little goes a long way. I used it weekly on my ankle for about 6 months. I still have some left and plan to use that for at least another month. I always get compliments on my henna tattoos."
3,Good but misleading,"The kit claims to provide enough henna (and supplies) for up to fifty tattoos. After you've read the book, you find out that when you mix the ingedients they are only useable for 2 days. So,you end up with only two chances for application, unless you want to tattoo your whole body or all of your friends."
1,"Henna ""kit""","It said ""everything you need to create stunning temporary tattoos,"" but it didn't come with any actual henna. I ended up throwing it away."
2,PLEASE READ,"Henna set was okay, the products they give you for the price you pay is not worth it. The applicator was difficult and the directions are not very helpful. The henna powder they send is no good, I tried on five different people, four of them didnt show, and one is was a VERY faint orange. If you want to purchase any stuff go to[...] You get A Lot more for your money, and have easier instuctions, designs, etc. You get 5 times more for your money. Hope this helped."
2,Not Entirely Impressed,"I purchased this kit despite the reviews just knowing from experience that sometimes you get a bad package and it ends up giving the entire line a bad name. To test a few different kits I also purchase another to compare this one to, which by the way did work wonderfully. The book in this kit is very nice and helpful if you are a beginner and want to get the basics down with a bit of history as to what cultures use henna and designs specific to those cultures. Remember though this is a kit and the book isn't very long, but well done. The Henna however was a bust, at least the first application didn't take at all. Instructions were followed closely and I was very disappointed that the stain didn't happen. Purchase at your own risk as it appears that there are ""many"" bad packages of henna in this kit. If nothing else you would have paste to practice with."
2,"Review for book only, not kit","This book apparently came with a kit. I bought it as a used book. There simply is not much information in the book, and the book tells you to use stencils. I found that I'd rather mix my own henna and make designs mostly freehand. I haven't tried the cone method in the book, although there are some tips for using them. I have just used bottles with tips. There are a couple of designs in this book that I may try, so it is worth what I paid for it as a used book. As far as the kit, I cannot comment on that."
1,Directions weren't correct,"This product was AWFUL! I followed the directions, but:-the solution was too thick and would not stay on my skin-after working with it for over 2 hours, it began the stick-the directions say: to keep the paste on the skin for 30-60 min,until it starts to ""crack"". After reading some websites, theyadvise you to keep it on for 3-5 hours, at least!-The solution never darkened and stayed an orange-ish color.-Washed off in less than a weekI've never been SO disappointed in a product before. Because of this, I had it returned."
1,lamp is a lemon,"Once set up, the lamp looked really cool and I liked it a lot. About four days later, the wire that connected it snapped. That was the end of the lamp!"
3,holster,"the gun fits in the holster very well and snug. i bought it to be able to take on and off easily, which it does. however, if you have to do a lot of walking it is not very comfortable. the end of the paddle rubs and its kind of sharp."
2,Beautiful Watch - But Broke Multiple Times,"My wife bought this watch for me last winter. It certainly looks great and it worked fine for the first 6 months. But then the band broke, the time-setting dial fell out of the watch when I wanted to set the time, and the watch stopped moving.We sent it in for repair (along with the $20 shipping and handling charge they require) and after a month of holding onto the watch they sent it back. The band was fixed and the watch was ""working"" again, but when I went to set it, the time-setting dial came out and it stopped working again.I sent it in to them again and after keeping it for another month, they recently sent it back to me but the problem is still there. I mailed it back to them a third time today and they promised over the phone to replace it this time. But it's a lot more trouble than one should have to go through for a watch."
1,Failed within a few months,"Got the watch off amazon, it looked ok to begin with , but it failed to work within 7 months. I've had many watches in my life, but none, even the $30 ones, were not of such poor quality. I checked out the Sturhling service center and unlike other companies, that stand behind their product, Sturhling wants the customer to pay them a flat rate of $20 and pay for shipping back and forth , EVEN IF THE WATCH IS COVERED BY WARRANTY ! So you pay for their poor build quality, that's a sweet deal for them, no? It also takes 2 MONTHS !!! to get it fixed.Overall , worst watch I've ever owned, worse than my $30.00 Timex.( who's 3 years old, working strong). Swiss quality my a**. BTW, the watch is not made is Switzerland, but somewhere in Asia. Shame on you Sturhling, you bunch of schemers. Would strongly argue against buying this watch and urge prospective buyers to look at other, more established ( and more reliable) brands."
1,Works good. Looks decent. Except Printed name on Glass makes it look CHEAP. Watch assembly satarted falling apart in 4 months,"Looks Good. Works Fine.Would have given 4 Stars if only the name ""Stuhrling Original"" was on stamped dial as shown in Product display image.Instead the name is printed on glass which gives it a cheap look. I wonder why the product display image doesnot show the name printed on glass. Was a special watch was made to show Stuhrling on dial and not on glass?Update: Tiny part within watch became loose. And the beauty of it is you can see it all :(After a 4 months decent, no rough use tiny gear became loose and you can see it loose moving around in the watch through the glass.Not sure if Stuhrling will repair it or amazon will give me a partial refund since the return window has expired."
5,GREAT GRADUATION PRESENT !!!,Purchased this watch for my son for his college graduation present. The watch looks fantastic in the presentation box. His eyes lit up when he opened the wrapper and saw it. He put it on immediately and has been wearing it ever since !! The watch looks terrific and has a look all its own.
1,Don't buy,"Please don't make the same mistake as I did, this watch looks much better than it works. Quality is really poor. I used it for 3 months, and it is broken now. I cannot return it, only repair, and I don't really want to repair it because I have to pay extra 20$ to the company for handling (awfull service)."
2,Off-center face glass,"PROS: The Watch, for the most part, looked very nice, I was pleased with the stylings. In addition it came in a very nice package.CONS: The front glass face had the words STUHRLING ORIGINAL printed on it. This lettering was supposed to be centered about 12 O'Clock but the front glass was rotated a bit conter-clockwise. The lettering was then centered about 11:58 instead of 12:00.I ended up returning the watch and getting a similar watch (different brand) at a brick and mortar store where I could inspect it 1st."
2,Swiss?,"Just for informational purposes, before you buy it, please be aware these watches are NOT Swiss made. I did research and found they are built somewhere in Asia. I purchased this watch a couple years ago from a retail store in the mall. Granted it looked good, but it lasted like 8 months. Your choice..."
5,Very Pleased with Product and Shipping,"I received my Stuhrling Original Winchester Skeleton watch and couldn't be more pleased with both the shipping time and the watch itself. I was surprised to get the watch in less than a week even with the free shipping. As for the watch, it's a nice, solid, and great looking watch that I'm excited to wear. I've already gotten positive comments on it!"
5,Very nice and Very quality watch,Well i got my watch today and i like it so much.when i opened the box i didn't believe that this was my watch!so nice! the finishing touch is just beautifull.I recommend this watch if you are looking for a skeleton watch!And this is not my last watch from Sturling!Well overall a great watch for this price.
5,Very Unique and Styled watch,"This was a gift for Christmas, it is a unique time piece to be handed down to grandson."
5,He loves it,"I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves this watch. Great price through Amazon and an additional year of warranty, making it 36 months."
2,Mine broke to soon.,Mine broke after about a year. The pumkin came off. had to go get it fixed. its also to big. other then that it does look cool. I think amazon owns this company becaus they push their products hard.
5,Beautiful Watch,This watch is a truly gorgeous time piece. I purchased it as a gift and was very excited to receive it in the mail today. I can't wait to see the look on the recipients face. The box it comes in is also beautiful as well.
4,Good watch,Good looking watch. After using this watch for over a month it works just as it did after day one.
5,Overlooked Joy,"Knowing the history of this book, or rather this Italian Romance, it is sad that it has been forgotten by many and only recently translated. I'm not sure I've ever read a ""classic"" or ""great book"" which was more outright fun and entertaining than this one. The legend of Orlando and Ranaldo and others is hilarious almost as often as it is heroic. The interactions portrayed between Christendom and the Islam and Pagan world is fascinating and I think unique as with the portrayal of women as several times displaying equal prowess with the men. You can't find half the magic, power, love, or enchantments in King Arthur as you can in Orlando. The fights and wars and adventures are really fantastic or at least on par with the various Arthurian tales I have read before. This is a must read for anyone who has enjoyed King Arthur, fantasy novels (as this seems to be the archetype), or those interested in a oft-forgetten classic of Christendom and the west."
3,Misleading Description,"Note product description! This was copied directly off of the advertisement at time of purchase:3/8 Inside Diameter 4 Foot Length with Chrome EndsKits include 3 feet of Steel-Flex fuel line with two Magna-ClampsNotice the first line says 4 foot and the second line says 3 feet? I read only the first line and was expecting 4 feet and I only got 3 feet. Not a huge deal but it is misleading. Other than that, the product was as described."
2,Not what I expected,"I have only watched this through once, but doubt I will watch it much more. Matt is certainly a good guitarist with a variety of skills, but I am not sure who this is aimed at. As perhaps an intermediate level, I am interested in soaking up as much detail as I can, but this left me high and dry.There are certainly demonstrations of a lot of styles, but the tab and the slowed down demo is usually restricted to a bar or two. The close up of his pick hand is screen lower right - just where the camera has placed the fret hand. Sometimes one blocks the other. I have not seen this mistake on other DVDs.On the positive side, the sections on phrasing are quite good (singing to rhythm and then putting it into notes), but not overly original.All in all a disappointing and short DVD with tabs that are of limited value. At least it is not an expensive DVD. There is much better out there (I am working from TrueFire lessons at the moment)."
2,not so good for big dogs,"I have two large dogs and it is very difficult to trim their nails with this trimmer. I have to apply a lot of pressure to get it to cut through their nails. The nail guard is nice, but for my big dogs, it does not allow me to cut off enough nail. I feel like these would be great for small dogs but not big dogs."
4,Great,We bought this trimmer to replace the guillotine style one that we had that broke trimming our St. Bernard's nails. These are heavy duty and work great.
5,"Easy, safe","I've never clipped my dogs nails before, but decided to give it a try with the new puppy. these are amazing! easy to use, and don't hurt your pup!"
4,Trimmers Good for Rabbits - Yes,"Having read many reviews about vaious products, opted to try these clippers for my Holland Lop rabbits. No one talked about using these style for bunnies. After looking at many other clipper styles even more expensive ones I bought these and they did the job. Way easier, faster and safer than the wire cutters and toe nail clippers I had been using. They are stainless steel with a spring return. When the blade squeezes together it forms an oval to cut nail fairly even all the way around to avoid cracking. There are useful instructions and nail groom tips included. What would make these cutters better is to have a more rounded snip shape."
4,Works,"This seemed great. However, the special guard on the back that limits the depth of your cut (and therefor ""prevents"" you cutting the quick [the vein in the nail]) failed me. My dog yelped and bled and it grossed me out. These won't make you a professional, but if you know what you're doing, great!"
2,Flimsy guard,"After using the trimmer a few times, the guard will not stay in place. I only feel comfortable cutting my dog's nails with the guard up, so now I have to buy another one. I wouldn't recommend this trimmer."
5,Easy to use,These are so easy to use on my dog! The little piece of metal that makes shore you don't snip too much off is so helpful. Thank you for an afordable and easy to use nail clippers!
5,Works Great,I got this for my 2 year old in door cat. Her nails grow like crazy. This worked great. Sharp and easy to use. The cut her nails with out splitting them. The shape make it easy to cut her claws short.
3,"Does the job, but my dog doesn't like it","It's made of quality material, sturdy, easy to use. The safety guard is very convenient. But the loud ""snapping"" noise when you clip a nail is kind of a shock to my dog. The clipper also leaves rough edges, but I think that's how all clippers work..."
5,Great,I love these. I am a dog groomer and this is what I use. I have small hands and they fit it them nicely. THey are sharp enough to use on most types of dogs even big ones. I highly recommend them.
5,Best Nail Clippers - EVER,"My dog HATES having his nails clipped. While these don't make him love the situation, since getting these I have noticed that he doesn't pull away as much and he doesn't seem to have any discomfort. They are sharp, quick, and don't cause excessive splintering of the nail like some I have tried in the past. I would definitely recommend!"
5,Great product!,"I bought these after my old dog clippers started wearing out. I purchased the first pair at Target for double the price, and the quality is noticeably less than these new ones. The old pair didn't make clean cuts. The bolt assembly started coming loose which only made them clip even worse. So I came to Amazon to find a new pair. These ones were cheap and had great reviews... for a good reason! Each cut is very clean and doesn't leave any ""hangnails"". They are sharp and require less force to snip the nail. Because of this, it took me about half the time it used to take to clip all of my dogs nails. I'm sure he was very appreciative of that as he hates getting his nails trimmed. All in all, this is a great product, especially for the price. If you need a new pair of clippers (or even if you don't) these are a great choice."
4,Pretty nice clippers,"These clippers work pretty well. For the average owner, they are more than adequate. The size is great, and they work well for pets that have small but thick nails and shorter toes. Overall, I am pleased with the product."
5,Great product,"Great trimmer, I have a dog with large nails and this trimmer works great. Great value for the money, highly recomended"
5,Great Nail Trimmers,These work great and are nice and sharp. They have a safety stop so you dont cut too much. And they are nice to hold
3,Blades are sharp and easy handle,"Blades are sharp and handles are easy even for arthritic hands to hold onto. Not a lot of pressure required to make the cut. A little less expensive than brands in the big pet stores, but not available in stores. Had to order online, but shipping was very reasonable."
1,False advertisement,"States ""large nail trimmer for dogs."" Once received its for small to medium dogs. Why would the word LARGE be in the title for small or medium dogs? Guess these will be thrown in the garbage and I will take my dog to the groomer as usual for nail clippings. The actual word LARGE appears nowhere on the packaging at all...false advertisement if you as me."
2,doesn't seem to work well,"our lab does not like this...it is supposedly good because it has a guard to keep you from trimming the nails to short, but we still made her nails bleed. it was sad."
3,Cut well but not as expected,These trimmers cut well but not as well as expected based on the reviews for this project. I'm using them for my two cats. I think they'll do an ok job for your pets claws.
3,it's ok,"haven't quite used it yet but will in the future i'm sure. it has great recommendations, and i trust them."
2,"Good clippers, but NOT FOR CATS","Because it's labeled as a ""pet nail"" trimmer, as opposed to just a ""dog nail"" trimmer, I mistakenly assumed these clippers would be appropriate for use with my two medium-large cats. I was very wrong. The clippers are too large and don't provide a good view of the nail while clipping. The nail guide, which might be appropriate for dogs, caused a cut that was significantly too short for my cats. One clip was all it took for me to abandon this clippers, while simultaneously trying to stop poor kitty's bleeding quick. Still, I will probably offer them to a friend who owns a dog, for which I suspect they will work better."
4,Easy Nippers For Your Claws!!,"These nail clippers are great.I have 3 dogs and their nails grow faster than I can clip them. The trimmers are sharp,safe and easy to use.My dogs have very sensitive feet,so I have to do the clipping fast.I have enjoyed not hurting the paws.It's a big relief. So if you have shy pups that hate their feet messed with, these trimmers are spot on."
5,Very good clippers,I'm happy about purchasing them.The clippers I purchased a couple years ago at a large retail store were getting dull so I tried my luck with these.I would recommend buying if you are looking for a good pair of clippers.
5,If only.......my puppy would sit still long enough,"I have clipped a few of my puppy's nails with these - so far they work great. Unfortunately, he won't sit still long enough for us to do them all. :-( GREAT PRODUCT and shipped fast......"
2,Difficult to Configure,"After three hours battling with the so-call ""easy to configure"" device, I finally got it to work. However, I still don't have a clue what I had done to make it work.Unlike, the WET11, it doesn't have a switch to let you switch to x-over mode. So if you want to plug it onto your PC and configure it, you need to get yourself a x-over cable.Also the new firmware can only be upgrade through the Windows based Utility. So if you are using OS other than Windows, you may have problem to upgrade your ME101.In addition, the web configuration page is slow and buggy. If you access it through the wired port, you are okay. But if you try to open it wirelessly, it is like lottory. You can open it sometimes, and can't others.Bottom line is, if you can affort a bit more, the WET11 seems like a better solution."
1,Looks Nice but doesn't work,"I have spent about 2 hours too long trying to get this device to even see my wireless network. I started with it about 40 feet away from my router. I then moved it to 30....20......10....on top of my router and it was still unable to even detect that I had a wireless network running. I then tried to configure it with my laptop that has a wireless nic in it, The strength on the nic was 100% but 0% on the me101. Trust me save your time and shiping costs, just buy the linksys it works."
1,BAD BAD BAD,"I also own a Netgear wireless router. Configuring ME101 to work with my Netgear router wasn't an issue. However, the wireless bridge only works for several hours and hang. Sometimes it only works for mintues. I've updated the firmware and it's not helping at all. It's a piece of crap."
2,Great...if it would work more than a few hours,"I bought this little bridge to connect to my D-Link 614+ access point. During setup, it immediately found the D-Link and I was connected without issue. Unfortunately, this would only last for a random amount of time, usually a few hours, but could go for a day before disconnecting. The only solution was to power cycle the bridge. I returned it and bought a D-Link 900+ AP and it works flawlessly. My advice: Use the same vendor for all of your wireless equipment if you can. So far, if I don't, I usually have irritating problems like this."
1,i am sad ...,"very instabil product much packet loss, hangs often und must becold started, BUG: con not operate with hidden SSID !!"
1,"Very poor performance, 35% to 65% packet loss","In its defense, version 2.0 of the firmware will make it a real bridge and pass thru the DHCP requests to the DHCP server, and it will assign itself an address from the DHCP server. But this is not the DEFAULT configuration, so you have to install their configuration (PC-only) utility to force that mode (BTW the password is ""password"").After upgrading the firmware and seeing 12 hours of fine performance, I started getting HUGE packet losses. I'm running 3 PCs and 2 Mac OS X boxes thru it. Rebooting cleaned up the problem for about 5 minutes. It is UNUSABLE in this state.I called their customer service -- which they've outsourced to India -- a corporate trend I cannot support.It's going back to the store >:-p"
1,A very poor choice,"I use Netgear products exclusively but this is a real dog. I bought the ME101 based on assurances from Netgear support that the ME101 would act as a wireless repeater after a firmware upgrade. it would not configure properly, the configuration utility failed to recognize the bridge even after I specified an IP address and therefore I was never able to upgrade the firmware. It took 4 calls to Netgear support and an escalation before I was told the product would not operate as I had been advised. This product did not perform adequately"
1,The worst wireless device I've ever used,"The ME101 worked great - for a few hours at a time. After many calls to Netgear, finally got a replacement. Unfortuantely, it stopped working completely within a month or so. Since then I have called many times, and have been promised a return call from Level 2 support. That never happened. Just today, I called four times, and all four times was disconnected when transferred to Level 2. I've given up on this product."
1,This one is going back,"I've had nothing but problems with this thing, and, after spending hours in an infinite hold loop with their offshore tech support, I'm giving up."
3,"OK device, needs a little work","1. High price should be about $30 (my guess is that the price is higher because of the very nice, compact, switching power supply)2. MUST upgrade to 2.0 software to cure instability (would lock-up all the time before upgrade, now it's very stable)3. Would be great if someone sold a small bridge like this with an integrated hub ...4. Setup is OK ... SNMP based custom application requireing a static IP for the device ... needs a little work, how about DHCP and web setup?I bought this to connect a small lab in my basement to the rest of the house network ... house has no cabling and I got tired of dragging a 100 foot cable down the hall from the office. Out of the box it had firmware version 1.0 on it ... it would lock up after about 20 minutes and need to be power cycled ... Netgear's web site has a 2.0 firmware load available ... Once I did the upgrade it has been rock solid and does the trick for me."
1,Love the book dislike the condition,I love the book and the movie so I ordered the book to do an psychology project for my Adolscence class. The condition of the book was rated good. It is a hot mess. The seem is ripped and worn the pages are falling out and stained and it smells ghastly!!! This seller is disaster to deal with!
2,It works,"Its a temporary fix not a permanent, I even patched my tubes and they leaked air when I left the bike stationary. It only works when wheels are spinning."
2,Presta valves,"Warning, this product does not work with Presta type tire valves. This is not stated in the description. Fine if you have Schrader valves"
3,the sealant itself works but the cap tool is a joke,"I used couple of bottles of these to fix kids' bike flats. The sealant did a good job to stop leaks. However, the tool provided to screw off and on the valve stem is a joke, each one of them stripped on my second time use, causing jammped stem valve or even damaged valve(tube). What I have done is to buy a metal stem tool from REI (costs only one dollar!) to be sure no more stripping on the stem when using Slime. I think Slime should have included one like that with the bottle."
4,Great Progressive Trance CD,"This purchase was a gamble but it paid off. Art Of Trance releases an amazing proggy beats and beautiful vocal trance. Disc one has more of a progressive sound, while disc two has more melodic and vocal uplifting trance. This definately was not a disappointment. I highly recommend this album to any trance collector/lover."
4,Looks like a good place to start,"This book is recommended by Ned Beaumont in a couple of his books. This book looks like it would be good for a kid dealing with bullies, like the other reviewer. The techniques aren't hard core and brutal, it's stuff that shouldn't get you in trouble with the law. It's got some pretty good basics, the grappling could have had a couple of joint locks added though. It should have been a little bigger and a little more detailed. I'm going to give it to my little brother, I think it'll help him. I ordered mine through amazon from Adsrus on a Saturday. It shipped on Monday from Iowa and arrived at my home in south east Texas on Thursday. The total cost was $6.42. It's definitely a good deal."
5,Original,"I heard of these guys in the summer of 2008 with their song ""Isolate"" from Ain't It Beautiful. Then, I heard from my buddy they have a show on IFC, but I didn't have that channel. I waited for this to come out on DVD and I immediately bought this...watch it so many times...its funny...its very original...so many guest stars...make the show extra funny...I recommend this for a good laugh...ROCK ON ZO2.."
4,great independent show!,"had to order Season 1 because I came on late watching the show...it's a really fun show! you don't get enough of their music by watching the show only, so definitely order the CD with it....they really do rock!"
1,A waste of Paper,"This is one of the worse books I have read in the analytic literature over the last 20 years. Please, read Greenberg & Mitchell, and skip this god awful text! Summers says nothing new, and his uninspired prose is sure to bore."
1,Dreadful. Unwatchable.,"Radiohead is one of the great musical forces of the past 30 years, but after watching this silly DVD collection, I have to wonder what they could have been thinking. It's one thing to have a strong, personal vision. It's another thing to have a personal vision that's so obtuse and awkward that it literally mindless. What a waste of time and money."
3,Cool songs but lousy DVD,Love Radiohead (especially their paranoid android) but the DVD is just doesn't cut it. It's just got a stereo track only no digitals
2,if i was rating each video,"If I rated each fo these video's as I watched them on T.V. I would most certainly give most of them 5's. maybe a few 4'sStreet Spirit's one of my favorite videos' and that along with Fake Plastic Tree's ( a pretty mediocre video actually) are the song/video's got me into radiohead.The Reason this package gets 2 stars is its just so bare bones. Its a bit of a waste unless your so hard up for something radiohead related. With so Much more video/footage of Radiohead that they could have included, its annoying that something this small would be released. Most of these video's are good for a couple viewings. But there are much better Music DVD packages out there, for around the same cost."
2,Just Okay....,"I LOVE Radiohead. Their music speaks to me. Their music videos, im not too sure. What I love about Radiohead is that their ideas are unique and innovative. It's all there in these music videos, but they aren't executed to well. They're eccentric, which is a good thing, but not exactly brilliant or affective. The music videos I liked were No Surprises (simple, plain, but affective with Thom York's face mouthing the lyrics to the song), and Fake Plastic Trees (strange, lots of bright colors, interesting looking people, it has a somewhat vulnerable feel that's very affective). The rest to me were either just OKAY, such as High and Dry and Just, while others just didn't do anything for me, such as Paranoid Android, Street Spirit, and Karma Police. The good thing is that i liked all the songs though, but just not all of the music videos. This is for major Radiohead fans. If you can rent it like I did, i'd recommend doing that."
1,"Sold as ""New"" but several DVDs in the set have scratches and fingerprints on them","I purchased 3 box sets of the LEXX series and I have just opened the season 4 box set - much to my dismay the discs do not appear to be ""new"" as promised - several discs have heavy scratches on them and one had fingerprints. Lexx - Season Four (Boxset)Sold by 949053 Ontario Inc. (themoviegiant) - I won't be buying any more dvds originating with this supplier to Amazon - very, very disappointed. I will attempt to return it but I had to open the box set b4 I could see the damage.Lexx - Season Four (Boxset)First time in all my orders with Amazon I have ever encountered a problem - obviously this was not a ""New"" box set."
2,what?,A gay robot head gets a body with a large member to try to impress kai.this has got to be the dumbest lexx episode in the series.I will say season 4 got pretty stupid compared to the previous 3 seasons.no wonder lexx never had a 5th season.
5,Fantastic,"If you like silly sci-fi, give Lexx a shot. The show is interesting and sexy as well and the characters are very well rounded."
2,Sad end to a good show,"I came to Lexx late, having only discovered it at the end of 2012, but really enjoyed the first three seasons. The 4th and final season was not very good because they stuck the main characters on Earth, which turned the plot lines predictable.The first three seasons were great, but not this one."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This the cheesiest and stupidest Si Fi TV series since ""Flash Gordon"" and ""Captain Video"" in the 1950s!! The sets are cheesy, the costumes are cheesy, the dialogue is cheesy, and the acting is cheesy!!"
1,"Great series, terrible reissue","Lexx is a great innovative Sci-fi series, thus my one star review reflects the lousy effort by Echo Bridge Home Entertainment. The image transfer of this new edition is awful and the discs aren't even numbered. Do yourself a favor and try to find the original editions."
2,This poster is NOT 27x40,Just a warning to anyone else looking to frame this poster. It is not 27x40 as the description claims. It is actually 24x39.
1,"Bad Pictures, Confusing Directions, No Good Maps",I thought this book was terrible. There are only black & white pictures and few of them. The directions provided are very confusing and are not accompanied by any sort of map. It is full of information and places to go but VERY poorly organized.
1,Piece of junk,"I bought this touchpad to alleviate wrist and arm pain from using a mouse. It had such great reviews here on Amazon. The touchpad is too small for convenient use, and the entire device is so light that it inadvertently moves all over the place with the slightest nudge. It is not synched correctly with onscreen motion so that the cursor movement is sometimes not immediately reflected correctly on the screen. This is junk - a total waste of $43."
1,a fairly useless book replete with errors,"As a programmer I found this book to be fairly useless in comparison to the O'Reilly line of books. There are countless instances where the plainly obvious is spelled out in long tedious paragraphs, but other obscure parts of the code are left unexplained. For a book that claims to be the ""bible"" there were also many notes indicating that a given topic was outside the scope of the book. I'd have to agree with the writer who said that this book doesn't explain how to put the various building blocks together to make a functional program. I think the tutorial on Sun's website is at least as useful and certainly a lot cheaper."
3,Not For Beginners,"I am an experienced programmer, but I found this book difficult. By Page 120, you have been given the Hello World example and by page 323 you have been given the basic syntax. However, alot of the code examples continually use stuff that the reader has not yet been exposed to. Also, no where up to page 323 does the book really explain how you write a basic java class. The chapters cover individual topics, but nothing links the chapters together. The book gives the reader separate building blocks, but little guidance on how to construct a usable program with those blocks. I learned much more at the Sun tutorial site than I did from reading this book."
2,Yikes is right!,"I don't really know what to make of this book. It started out great. I devoured the first 5 chapters (~170 pages) in a weekend. Then, inexplicably, the authors depart from their tutoring role and go into lecture mode. After the obligatory HelloWorld example and a few sample applications and applets in the first part of the book, we are subjected to reading the next 200 pages before another interactive exercise appears. It's a shame, too, because I really like the authors' writing style. They definitely kept me interested but I just felt that I wasn't learning anything with the meager offering of hands-on exercises. I'll give the book 2 stars for the excellent Part I of the book. The rest is all down hill. What a letdown."
1,if (java2bible == java2babble) { doNotBuy(); },"I get annoyed with these ""kitchen sink"" books that purport to cover everything and in reality *teach* us very little. I never need just *one* book for everything. I'd also like to highlight the fact that J2EE includes RMI (incl. Activation fwk), Corba (IDL, etc..), JNDI, EJB, Servlets (perhaps JSP). These topics are conspicuous by their absence so avoid this for J2EE and get: Java Enterprise in a Nutshell.I pity any java-junior trying to balance this weighty tome on their knees: it's sheer size is unworkable. The book is a cancerous polyp on the butt of an over published tech-book-market."
2,where are the ejb's??,"i would have thought that any ""bible"" on enterprise java would at least deal with J2EE. instead, from the list of topics covered, we get the usual basic comparison between C/C++ and Java. big deal. nothing new there. then there's more basics on OOAD. again, if i wanted to know about that, then i'd get a book dedicated to that. justin has released another ""technical book"" on java 2 networking, and it appears that it must be replicated here. not that that book is worth reading either. take a look at the comments over there.what's the point?what about:JSP's?Servlets?CMP vs. BMP (when to use, guidelines, etc, how they work...)Transaction boundaries?if i'm way off-base here, then feel free to disregard this review ;) but in my opinion, if i wanted a bible on enterprise java, i'd by a book published by Sun."
3,"Very cool idea, not very well executed.","The idea of this shifter knob is very cool. Right out of James Bond, but in practice it doesn't always work and the materials it is made from seems cheap. The paint scratches too easily and it looks cheap. I would pay more, for a better made, more reliable and higher quality looking knob."
1,IT STUNK FOR GOSH SAKES!!!!,"Personally, I love Ann Martin and California Diaries, but this book....It was too depressing. Nobody, especially a teen would have to go through what Ducky did. Unrealistic and overdramatic, I LAUGHED in the middle of it. My Faves were Dawn, Maggie, Amalia."
2,aN o.k. BOOK,"this book was O.K. but it was boring a lot of the time if your going to get a california diaries book , I would suggest a different one"
5,Ducky's diary is my favorite one.,"Ducky used to have two friends. Their names were Jay and Alex. Jay discovered free weights, hair gel, and girls. Alex is always depressed. Jay invites Ducky and Alex to a party to bring back the old times. At the end, Ducky becomes friends with Jay and he loses Alex as a friend."
5,Who knew Martin could write honestly about guy's experiences,"This book, being the first book that actually enter's a male's mind by Ann M. Martin, is proof that Martin can write from both sides. I reccomend it for anyone who enjoyed any of her other books, and anyone who enjoys honest looks into people's minds."
3,Ducky Dairy One,"Ducky is dealing with a lot of pressures in his life. He is only a sophmore and his only true friends are four 8th grade girls. His two ex-best friends, Jason a.k.a. Jay and Alex have both drifted away. Jay is now interested in only girls, and Alex has emotional problems and is suicidal. To add to that, his parents are both away on a business trip to Ghana leaving him and his irresponsible brother with the house. While not coping with his problmes he continually comes to the rescue of his 8th grade friends."
4,good themes,"this book had some good themes. they were a bit unrealistic, but never seemed cliched. i really liked ducky, because he was an interesting character, and reminded me a lot of some people that i know. he has lots of problems, but he works to solve them and this book might end up helping other people with their similar problems. the thing i liked best about the book was that it wasn't preachy. also, (i know it's probably not true, but...) does anyone else get the feeling that ducky's gay?"
1,If you already have any other guitar book don't buy this one,"I just bought my first 12 string guitar.(my 6th guitar actually) I rushed on amazon.com to find a book to help me learn to play the 12 string. Bought this book and thumbed through it. The only thing I found in learning to play the 12 string was one page. Basically telling me to play both the strings at the same time. The rest was just like any other guitar book I have ever seen.This book is very basic on it's approch to play the guitar, with nothing really about 12 string playing. I'll help anyone looking at this book right now. Play the pair of strings as one."
4,Truly lovely,"As I said in the title, this piece of jewelry is indeed truly lovely, and well made too - nothing flimsy or cheap looking about it. The crystal is a very nice size as well. This was a very satisfying online shopping experience in every aspect!"
4,Beautiful!,"I have to replace the chain because it's a little too small, but the stone is absolutely gorgeous! It's a christmas gift for my sister and I know she will adore it. Thank you!"
1,Not for mushrooms,"I got this thing since it was labeled as being an egg/mushroom slicer. After 3 mushrooms, two wires snapped and that was the end of it. Didn't even get through my first batch!As an egg slicer, it seemed like it'd be average. But for mushrooms? No chance."
3,Good - but could be better,"This is the best of all the egg/mushroom slicers I've ever used. I've owned several plastic slicers over the years and they wobble and bend when you try to slice an egg. Don't even consider using them on a mushroom. Compared to what is on the market this is worlds better than what you are likely to find. However, because the slicing wires don't go past the holder, on tough items like mushrooms, it doesn't usually cut cleanly all the way through. This is the best I've ever used, but it could be better."
3,Good for the Price,"For around $5.00 this is a good deal. Any more money and it wouldn't be. It is not amazing quality and the dishwasher makes it super ugly. I haven't had mine super long yet, but so far it gets the job done. I would have a hard time paying more money for something that cuts an egg. Something that isn't hard to do without this gadget. So for the price this is a good deal. Just don't expect anything fancy!"
2,"It will go bust on you, baby!",The problem with this and virtually all wire mushroom slicers made in the USA and some abroad is that they will go bust on you eventually! One day the wire will give this little mean snap and curl up on you. No one so far seems ot know how to crate a longlasting product of this type.
2,Functional but ugly,"Don't wash this thing... the shine comes right off and it becomes dull dull dull... but hey, it cuts eggs."
1,Beware the Finish!,"The slicer works great, but the finish wears off and gets on your food. I had to throw it away... very disappointing."
2,Can't clean!,Functionally the egg slicer works OK but it turned black when washed and the black comes off on the food! The aluminum needs to be treated.
2,I got a different Set,"The decorations that I got was of Simpsons, however I received different ornaments, I was hoping for the ones shown on the picture. I wanted it as a gift for my friend who loves simpsons, so I think I will keep the item but I am very disappointed since it is not what I ordered :((("
4,very pleased,"Finding out what my daughter was learning in school made me want to reinforce her learning at home. We choose Arthur because she really likes all the characters in their show. All the activities have three levels of difficulty and will also track the scores. The best part was after accomplishing a few games in each activity my child was awarded a dot to dot certificate, which is now her favorite. She found all the activies very fun and rewarding. She was also very excited when they wished her a happy birthday!"
1,terrible people,I bought the ABo Dog digs pet crate. the crate I received was not the one pictured. I travel alot so I didn't get to open for almost a month and then i thought about whether I wanted it. I decided I didn't..and hadn't used it. They refused to take it back..they said the product info said no returns. I went back to the ad and there was nothing any where that said that.
3,"ABO Gear Dog Digs Pet Crate, Large","We purchased this item as it was extremely portable, looked nice, and thought it would be great for our new 3 month old Dachound puppy. Little did we know that the very first time we put her in it and left for two hours she would eat through the mesh window. Now we have a very expensive item that it useless. We had to go out and spend the same amount of money on an all wire crate."
1,Awful - cheaply made,This crate only lasted 2 days before it fell apart. If you have an active dog that gets excited when you return then do not buy this - our lab went right threw the mesh/screen like it was not even there. What a waste of money.
5,Great for my lab!,"I got this because I wanted to have a crate that was easy to take to different places so my lab/golden retriever (75lbs) would have a place that felt like home and I couldn't be happier! Many of the other crates fold up and are still SUPER bulky, but this one folds like a canvas lawn chair. It's wonderful! The only issue is getting my dog used to the entrance being on the wide side (she's used to a black wire crate), but she's adapted well. Overall, I am pleased. This looks great in my room and is super easy to set up and take down to move it. Highly recommended."
2,Dissapointing,"Simply put, I don't think the alt takes and remixes offer anything particularly new or interesting. The sound is flat. I don't think the tracks work well together in an album format, and all around it seems a bit lost. For some reason, Orton's singing doesn't seem to fit with the instrumentals. Her voice on that first track sounds as though she's dying, and I don't mean that in a good way.There are a few promising tracks, esp ""Bobby Gentry"" and the Roots Manuva remix, but I think that's the case in spite of, rather than due to, Beth Orton's efforts.Anyway, those of you who really like Orton (as I do) will probably go buy this disc despite this review. I suppose I'm writing this for those of you who are newly discovering her. For those of you who are interested in checking Orton's music out, I have to strongly recommend ""Central Reservation"" and ""Trailer Park"" as better places to start. She has a lot of great material out there that's worth hearing."
2,Fans can never be objective...,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...if this was Beth's attempt to improve on her less than stellar release ""Daybreaker"" she failed miserably and should have left it alone."
3,Beth Orton songs are beautiful.,She has made incredible songs in the past using her soul and guitar. I was surprised to see the remake of ooh child rather than a new song that had this feel. I have heard it in her tracks before. The remixes also aren't making the most of her talent. This CD was disappointing as I have been waiting for some time and looking forward to the next release. Get rid of whoever is telling you to change.
2,Indulgent for all the wrong reasons,"Don't let Orton's heart-wrenching cover of Ooh Child fool you into thinking this is little more then a glorified b-sides/remix disc exploiting her small fan base, and reminding all others of her trite songwriting abilities. She needs to stick to the minimalist acoustic thing, because when she even ventures into electronic-ville, her songs are devoid of life."
3,A Must Have For Fans,"I'm a big Beth fan, and has such am not disappointed. But am not overly impressed either."
1,Nothin nice to say,"I listened to this album twice just to be certain I wasn't missing anything. Mama said, ""if you can't say nothin' nice-then don't say nothin' at all""So I have ""nothin'"" to say-this is truly a stinker."
4,The Curious Life of Robert Hooke,"Definitely not for the casual reader or the faint-hearted but an excellent read all the same. You will need to be pretty curious about Mr. Hooke and his cantankerous personality to navigate this book. The extensive use of quotes from original texts and letters provides the story with authenticity that is admirable but sometimes, makes it a little laborious read. I suspect it is important to understand how Hooke was hooked on patent medicines and opiates, not to say the odd heavy metal, but constantly reading about his vomiting habits is not for the squeamish, particularly at the breakfast table. However this is a great read and I came out of it feeling more sympathetic about Hooke who accomplished more in each month of his life than most of us do in a lifetime. Certainly Lisa Jardine made a comprehensive effort to capture the whole man and succeeded perhaps a little too much."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"This camera is a perfect example of you pay for what you get. I bought this camera, because I thought it was a steal at the sale price. This camera has no real on-board memory. You cannot take 1 high-resolution picture with out a compact flash card. The pictures are grainy at best and forget about low light pictures, because you wont see a thing. This camera is o.k. For a young teen, but no adult who will want to use this camera to capture those precious moments of life will not be satisfied."
3,Good value for money,"This camera is good for the money. It is good for the person who will mainly use it just for e-mail without very much zoom. You can print photos as long as you keep the photos not much larger than 5x7. Has built-in flash, LCD, and Compactflash Card slot."
1,pass on this,"The camera has clumsy controls and takes blurry pictures. I got one but returned it anyways, because the picture quality wasn't something I could use."
1,Worst BUY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i bought this camera no more then a couple days ago and it breaks! i just bought a new media card and when i went to put it in the thing just froze or shut off. i would take it out then it went back on except the last time i did it, it didnt turn on anymore after that. now i have to return the memory card. i wouldnt buy this camera ever agian in my life. it broke in under two days of use. i hope this helps you."
2,Not Impressed,"This was heavily discounted at a major retailor that startswith an 'O' and ends with an 'x' so I thought I would try itout. Unfortunately, the poor image processing and fixed-focusdon't compensate for the 1.3Mpixels and I ended up returning it.I'd strongly recommend spending an extra [amount of money] and gettinga Canon A100 instead."
3,Spectre Magna clamps #2261,"i received 10 clamps, same as shown, shipping was very fast, only problem was the fittings i got were for 1/2"" and not 3/8"" as i ordered, but since i already have them I'll find somewhere to use them. I'm happy with the quality of service i received, but just a little disappointed i didn't get exactly what i wanted..."
5,The Zenith of Lon Chaney,"I didn't like silent films until I saw this movie. This movie is perhaps one of the best silent films in American history! Lon Chaney is excellent as a sad clown whose love for his 'daughter' is unrequited. Loretta Young is just ravishing! Even if the storyline is a little strange, it will captivate you, I guarantee it!"
5,Lon Chaney Collection,Received as advertised. Very quick delivery. Highly recommend. Been looking for this for awhile.
2,Disappointing presentation of The Unknown,"I bought this release mainly to get ""The Unknown"" and I am sorry to say that I am very disappointed with the quality of the presentation.There is a disturbingly bright white line at the right side of the screen present throughout the entire film. The Alloy Orchestra's soundtrack is extremely annoying as well. It undermines the emotional impact of every important scene, especially compared to the wonderful excerpts from this movie with a proper orchestral soundtrack during the documentary ""Lou Chaney: A Thousand Faces"".This documentary is really the only reason I decided to keep the collection. The presentation of ""Laugh, Clown, Laugh"" is also quite good."
5,Another treasure,"I just love Jamie Slocum, the music is so moving. Thank you God for allowing me to find this artist."
5,A NEW STAR ONTHE RISE! Great Music,"I heard Jamie Slocums single "" I cannot turn away"" on my local radio station in Rockford.I had also attended his concert last year at the Rock church. I walked away a new fan of Jamie Slocum.I tell you what "" MY heart Knows"" is a masterpiece of great songs from I think a new star on the horizon.All of my friends were borrowing it to play and that in itself is amazing from a chrisitan singer.Do you want a cd with song after song of great music and filled with a great message of hope? ( By your side)( MY heart knows)( way back home)Then Get Jamie Slocums "" My Heart knows"""
1,the worst humidifier ever!!!!!,The noise is unbearable!!! It's like having an airplane engine in your house... plus it doesn't really add enough humidity to the room and the water container is not properly designed. The filter does not work and the ionizing feature is a joke - -do not waste your money on this product!!!
3,Buyer beware!!!,"This has got to be THE LOUDEST humidifier in the world. It is almost unbearably noisy. The fan runs so hard that the ground around my unit actually vibrates! But it does its job I guess, and one could never claim that this humidifier isn't a hard worker. *smile*"
1,Awful product!,"The fan is exceedingly loud even on low. Forget about sleeping, or even holding a conversation. Not sure if the electronic humidistat is working, since it never reached 45% humidity even after two days of basically continuous use."
1,Broken?!?!,"Bought this last night. Thought it looked nice and had a lot of nice features. When I plugged in and turned it on, it was so loud that I thought there was something slapping against the fan blade. My girlfriend and I spent about half an hour trying to figure out if we forgot to take something out. While we were trying to figure out the problem, our downstair neighbor rang our door bell and complained that the vibration was making a constant buzzing sound downstairs. TRUE STORY. I wish I read the reviews prior to the purchase. Now I'll have to waste more time returning this POS."
1,Ditto,I have to agree with every other review. Just bought this at a store near us and when we plugged it in we just figured it must be defective. It couldn't possibly run that loud normally! Then I saw all these reviews...Don't be fooled by the neat design!
2,Loud as a jet engine,"Turned it on for 15 minutes....hoped the rumble and turbulance of the fan noise would stop, no matter what speedit was on, this thing was annoying to have in a near by room. Returned to Walmart the following day....recommend skipping this model."
1,Another bad review,"I'm so relieved to read all the negative reviews on this humidifier. We just got ours from Home Depot and will be returning it immediatley. It doesn't work!! I was bewildered when the humidity gauge kept jumping from 29 to 39 every few seconds and would cycle on and off when in automatic mode. It seemed to be producing some humidity, but the LED display never told me accurately what the room humidity was or how much it increased. Shame on you, Holmes, for allowing such a poor product on the market. I may not buy another Holmes product in the future."
1,Noisey,"This product is noisey and the pieces do not snap in place, any movement the tank falls out and the tray (which is not fully explained in the instructions)falls out when you pick unit up. The result, water all over the floor. Poorly designed and so noisey it is disturbing.As for the return policy...unopened and in original condition. Had to use it before knowing what a piece of crap this thing is. So, unless there is something Amazon will do past their written return policy, we are stuck with this piece of junk."
5,A hoot,"I bought this in high school when it came out [edit: it turns out that's not true, it came out in 1982, and I bought it later, in 1986] [whoops, it turns out I was right in the first place; the reason the book has copyright years going back to 1982 is because it collects comics for those years]. My copy is tattered and literally falling apart from being read so much. It will make you laugh, it might make you cry, I hope it makes you smile, a lot. It's just wonderful."
2,"Good overview of keeping amphibians, but. . .","This book is a good overview of keeping amphibians if you know nothing about them. There are 149 pictures in the book, which is nice if you are looking for pictures, but there are only 59 pages with explanatory text. Unfortunately the pictures cover at least 50% of most pages. Usually it's more than that. There aren't too many details about any particular aspect of amphibian care. The accounts for the species are nice but don't give too much information. They tell what kind of habitat the amphibian needs, what kind of food they eat, and gives a picture. There are also some brief chapters on breeding, housing, and diseases. If you know what kind of amphibian you want to keep it would be better if you bought another book instead. This book could be good for people who don't know which kind they want or want a little bit of an idea of what caring for an amphibian might be like."
3,An author to keep an eye on,"Isolation Ward is a good debut novel. Every author tries to find a unique voice or some way of standing out from the crowd. Spanogle has done this by telling the tale in a first person narrative voice by a character with no shortage of attitude.The book has all the elements of a good medical thriller. The main drawback is that personality of the narrator, Dr. Nathaniel McCormick, tends to be overpowering. So if you think he is an entertaining blend of sarcasam, dedication, attitude, over-confidence and self-doubt, then you will love the book. I must confess that I grew a bit tired of the character by the end of the book.But Spanogle has demonstrated that he has what it takes to put together a good medical thriller. Let's hope he makes the necessary adjustments for a better, more likeable, more compelling 2nd book."
4,"Ingenious, sharp, exhilarating suspense!","Dr. Nathaniel McCormick is an investigator for the CDC. He is called in to St. Raphael's Hospital in Baltimore. Three young women from two different group homes have been admitted as patients showing signs of a deadly virus. Dr. McCormick and Dr. Verlach get started on the investigation of the group homes but their progress quickly gets waylaid. Nate goes against protocol too many times and gets sent out to California to investigate a dead-end lead. To complicate matters further for him, the three women who cause him the most joy and pain are in California. Brooke Michaels, Alaine Chen, and his mentor Harriet Tobel. Nate and Brooke manage to find the answers after many palatable moments."
3,Uneven,"This work represents an excellent beginning by the writer who was student in medical chool when this book was written. The first portion of this work reminded me of readinf Michel Crichton. The wuting was crisp and the story moved along raridly with characters that were well deneloped. The story kept this reader coming back for more. Yet, in the last third of the work, a drastic change comes about. The smooth writing that had been a staple of the writer appears to disappear and is forsaken in the interest of moving the story along. It works on some levels, yet is reduced to mediocrity on many others. The writer takes a rather believable story and makes it extremely pat with characters that seem to drop in and out for the convenience of the plot. This is an interesting book, yet is nothing special."
2,Disappointed,"I was very excited when I got my copy of this book. I am a big fan of medical thrillers. I started with Robin Cook and Michael Palmer and from then on I was hooked. Unfortunately for me, I selected the wrong book. It was very slow and he didn't pick up the pace until I was about 60 pages from the end. Then all hell broke loose. I have a feeling that Josh got a little help from people telling him to ""spice it up"". All in all, I was disappointed and still don't know what PERV means. Hope he does better on his second. I will give it a try but only the first 50 pages. If he hasn't hooked me by then, I'll give up."
3,A good first novel,"Joshua Spanogle writes a respectable first novel in ISOLATION WARD. His protagonist, a young infectious disease doctor with a checkered past, must unravel a series of ghastly infections in Baltimore. The story generally held my interest and I found the ending enjoyable, if somewhat predictable. My main criticism is that the plot lacked enough twists and turns. For the first several hundred pages the main character investigates the disease outbreak with little success - nothing learned, and only more questions discovered. Also, the author also spends very little time describing scenes and characters. Don't expect a lot of vivid imagery in this story. Nevertheless, Spanogle joins the ranks of mid-level thriller writers with this book. He is no Grisham or Crichton but the story does satisfy."
5,A YOUNG MICHAEL CRICHTON,"An extremely well written medical thriller. Joshua Spanogle grabs you on the first pages of this book and never lets go. His young Dr. Nathaniel McCormick has that irreverent quality of a genus and, yet, the despair of a man fighting a medical nightmare interwoven with government bureaucracy. How Spanogle made this work is a wonder, but work, it does.This is a book for those readers who appreciate a tight medical thriller, with terrific orginal characters. Pick this book up after dinner, and you won't sleep until you finish it. Welcome, young Doctor Spanogle to the ranks of Crichton and Cook."
4,A Good First Novel,"I think Joshua Spanolge has got a lot of potential. With this first novel he comes across as a solid writer with a story that has both suspense and an engrossing plot. The only thing I didn't care to much for was the lead character, Dr. Nathaniel McCormick. He's definitely not a people person and I didn't care for his attitude. Of course that's just the way he came off to me. Other than that it was a fine medical thriller and I'm sure to read his second novel tentatively entitled 'Growth Factor'."
3,Disappointing!,"After reading all the reviews, I was really looking forward to this being a good, well-written medical thriller. But as I began reading it, I grew increasingly irritated and annoyed with the writing. Although the author may have a good story line, the writing style is very juvenile. He throws in new abbreviations and terms, like a child trying to show off, look cool, or impress the adults around him by using big words. Why use the term ED (emergency department) instead of the more well-known ER? The dialogue was also difficult to read, feeling unnatural and not the way real people would talk. As I read, I found myself thinking ""a real person wouldn't say that. A real person wouldn't do that."" When a book is interesting and well-written, I can't put it down, and pick it up again whenever I have a spare moment during the day. That was not the case with this book. I have had to force myself to return to it from other books. Not a good sign."
3,Review By Samara,"Heart of a Chief was an ok book, it was very well written.I rate this book 3 stars because I liked it but it isn't a favorite of mine. This book is about a Penacook boy named Chris. His Mother died in a car accident and his dad is an alcoholic so he lives with his aunt and Doda. In school he was a very shy kid but later he became the leader of the group project.I think this book is trying to tell us that a Indian on a reservation is no different than me or anyone. My favorite part was when This kid named Pizza and three other boys and Chris light a fire and they want Chris to run but Chris says no because he wants to take responsability for what he did. I like this part because it is interesting and you just want to keep reading and it shows that Chris is very responsible. I would recomend this book to read because it teaches you about responsibiliy and Indians are still living on reservations."
4,A Little Chief,"1..It,s about a little boy that had a heart of a little chief.One monday afternoon his teacher assined him a project about indian names.That day he went to his grandfather he was a foule blooded ,,cherioke indian,,but Jake didn't know he was half.So he told his grandfather about his progect and he started telling some indian names.2..I think this is a ausome book because it's about a little boy how has a heart of a little worrier.3..When jake did'nt know he was half indian when he found out he was shocked ,he told everbody he was indian,but everybody did'nt belive him.4..This book is good can you tell by the stare rating."
5,Colin's Review,"Hello, my name is Colin and I've just finished reading the book ""The Heart of a Chief"".The book is very funny in some parts and in others sad.My favorite part of the book is 'Before we start our presentation' I say 'I would like to tell a story my uncle told me. A Pennacook man drives into a gas station.The gas attendant comes out and sees that the man is Indian.'Shall I fill it up Chief?' the gas attendant says.'No' the Pennacook man says 'just give me ten dollars worth Mr. President.'""I think that the book is a very good book, I give it 5 stars. I give it 5 stars because the story is about modern-day Indians,unlike most books. So you might want to read ""The Heart of a Chief,"" if you really like what I have talked about. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about modern-day Indians such as the main character of the book named Chris Nicola."
3,Michelle Speaks,"The Heart of a Chief is a great book which I just finished reading. I would give this book 3/5 stars beacuse I liked the book but i would prefer something with more action. My favorite part and quote is ""Are you the one that burned my house,destroyed my cornfield, and shot my dog?""""Yes,"" said the white man.""Well"" said the Indian. ""You'd better not let that happen again.""To me this means even though the white man disrespected the Indian, the Indian didn't disrespect the white man back. I really liked this book and would totaly recommend it."
3,Ann Marie's Heart of a Chief review!,"My name is Ann Marie and I finished reading Heart of the Chief. I gave the book 3/5 stars. My favorite part is when Chris tells the story about Laughing Louis when the man was jealous of him and burned his home.Chris is like us because he goes to a regular school and he is different because he lives on a reservation for Native Americens.I liked the last sentence on page 153:"" And I know that whatever happens to me from now on, whether it is good or bad, I will always remember this: that a true chief beats with the hearts of the people"".Other people should read this book because they could learn more about contemporary Native Americans."
4,The Heart of A Chief,I liked this book because it is about Indians and I like Indians. This book is about a boy named Chris who is going to go into 6th grade. He made some friends with really weird names. He and his friend named Pizza get into a really big fight and Pizza starts to like football. Chris has to do a report for school. He gets a group together and starts to think about what they all want to do. They want their school mascot to be an Indian name. What I learned was that you should not make fun of other culters.
5,Alec speaks Out,"THE HEART OF A CHIEFMy name is Alec and I finished reading THE HEART OF A CHIEF. If I had to rate the book I would give it 5 stars because of the dialogue. I learned that present day Indians drive cars, live in reservations, have small councils, and live in trailers. It really annoys them when team names are named after them. Chris is like me because he is Indian, and he cares for nature. He is different because he lives in a trailer and he lives with his grandparents. My favorite part is the chapter talking stick. An excerpt in this story is : The ""Aye"" that comes back so load so strong that it shakes the building like a giant roar of thunder. Other kids should read this book because it teaches about present day Indians. It's a great book!!"
4,Cara's Review,"Hi, my name is Cara and I am almost finished the book Heart of a Chief. My rating for this book is 4 stars.I learned about Indians in this book. Some of the things I learned in this book are that most Indians today live on reservations, go to school and drive cars.Chris is like me in ways and not like me in ways. He is not like me because he is an Indian and he wears Indian clothes and shoes. He is like me because he is a human being and he goes to school and has friends.My favorite part is when Chris and his friends burn the surveyors flags. I like that part because it shows that Chris cares about and loves his island.My favorite excerpt is on page 24-""We are the kinds of Indians that know hope rhymes with nope.""Other kids should read this book because it shows kids how to respect what they have because some people don't have as much as they doand it is a very good life lesson to know so they don't grow up to be a snob.I really enjoyed the Heart of the Chief, and you probably will to!"
3,Bobby's Heart of a Chief Reveiw,The Heart of a Chief is good book. I learned that if a schools mascot has to do with an Indian that might hurt the Indians feelings. I liked the part when Chris and his friends got in the old red Pontiac and they pretended to ride it. I also liked the part when Chris's Grandmother was sick and Chris was helping his Grandmother. I felt bad for Chris because his dad is an alchoholic and becuse his mom died in car crash. I think Joseph Bruchac is a great writer!By : Bobby B.
3,The Heart of a Chief,This book was pretty good. I can relate to this book because the boy in this book is about my age. I think this book should show in the end if Chris's dad comes back. I would reccomend this book to some of my friends. from this book I learned that Indians don't like Thanksgiving and Indian names for football teams hurt Indians feelings. This book is about a boy named chris who's going into middle schoool. A casino is going up on Chris's land and he's trying to get to go somewhere else. He saves his land. this is a happy book.
4,Alyssa's Heart of the Chief Review,"The Heart of a Chief was a good book. It helped me learn many important lessons. I learned about another new Indian tribe and I also learned that if you do something wrong, your friends may not be able to forgive you right away. I would recomend this book to anyone who likes to learn or wants to learn about Indians. My favorite part was when the group voted for Chris to be the leader and Chris wasn't sure if he should because he would be too nervous, but he didn't want to let the group down. I really enjoyed reading this book. If I had to I would read it again in a heart beat. Joseph Bruchac is a great author and I would love to read another one of his books.By:Alyssa L"
1,Very Dissapointed,I thought this would be an enjoyable book but it wasn't for me at least. The only time the book picked up was when he was doing his investigation on the murder case. Other than that it was terrible. Too much time was spent on his relationship with Sasha. Let's not even discuss the ending.
1,Did I read the same book?,"Reading some of the reviews, I pose the same question as one of the other reviewers, Did I read the same book?. I too usually read a book once I start it. For the first time, I just couldn't. The storyline itself was good but the writing left much to be desired. The comparisons were awful and the dialogue, well let's just say I don't know anyone who uses ""therefore"" in everyday conversation. Some sentences ran on so long I found myself reading them over to understand the point. Unfortunately, even then I sometimes wondered, ""What is he trying to say here"" or ""Why didn't he just say..."" In my opinion the character development was minimal at best. Mr. Johnson should hire another editor. Whoever was responsible for putting this book in shape certainly let him down.I will purchase his latest book, I hope he has improved. I want to be fair and first efforts are not usually the best."
5,GIVE ME MORE !,I truly enjoyed reading this book. I was intrigued from beginning to end. I will gladly suggest this book to all of my friends. Can't wait for your next book!!
5,#1 Detective (The Player),"I truly loved the book. Rique Johnson captures the readers imagination right from the start in this novel. The story is gripping, emotionally charged, and kept me eager to find out what drama awaited the main character next. Love and Justice was well worth reading and I recommend it for anyone struggling in a relationship trying to forget the past and move on to the future, along with personal niches in the midst of chaos. If you love mysteries, this book is for you!"
2,Where's the Antibacterial part?,"Unless I'm missing something here, all I see are cheap little plastic covers. There's no chemical, not even the smell of anti-bacterial component. The title and description is misleading."
3,Not quite fit Braun Toothbrush head,"brought it for traveling, but the cover isn't quite fit the toothbrush head. Agree that Butler should make a set designed for electronic toothbrush."
1,Tedious,"I generally enjoy any kind of romance with a military theme and the cover of this book quickly caught my eye. It's unfortunate, because I endured 297 pages of boredom in order to get to the anti-climatic finish.The ""heroine"" of the tale, Erin MacNamera is a bland character with very few redeeming qualities. Forced to grow up as a navy brat, she refuses to engage in a relationship with a wonderful man simply because he is in the military. She is petty, spiteful, and rude in her quest to drive him away.My biggest problem with the story is the fact that the author conveys an attitude that growing up as a military brat is a prison sentence. She fails to mention the plethora of benefits there are to being a military dependent. Most children of military tend to be outgoing, culturally sensitive, broadly educated and adventurous.This is the first book I've read by this author and it will also be the last."
3,Repetitive,"I liked this book even though it tended to be very repetitive. The dialogue between the two main characters seemed to go on and on and on. Also, after hearing Erin complain throughout the entire book about the fact that Brandon was ""navy"", I was waiting for a great ending. I felt as though the author got tired of the book herself and just ended it too abruptly. All in all, I did enjoy the book simply because it was light and airy and ended on a happy note."
2,Disappointed,"I have read about 30 of Debbie Macomber's books, and this is the first one that I didn't like. It was very tedious going and I just wanted it to be over. I found the lead character, Erin, to be a whiner, a complainer and a total idiot! Had this been the first book that I'd read by Ms Macomber, I would never have read another. Her Cedar Cove and Blossom Street books are excellent, so I can forgive her for this. I'm just glad that I bought it used and didn't spend a lot on it."
5,Navy Brat,"This Navy Brat book by Debbie Macomber came in good conditon. I was real please with it, esp for the price. It came pretty quick, faster than predicted.. thanks.."
5,There are 8 million stories in the naked city...,"Consistently in Murder Ink's top 25 best mystery novels ofall time, and deservedly so. Ex-cop and hard drinker MattScudder is hired by a prostitute to find out who killed a'coworker'- her pimp? A john? Scudder scours New York City'sunderground and his own wounded soul in this excellentsoul-searching novel by one of mystery's finest authors."
5,Block is America's best detective/mystery writer,"I have read hundreds of mystery authors (have worked in retail book store for a number of years), L. Block's Scudder series is the best American detective series in print. Period. A MUST read (every book in the series) for all detective fiction fans."
3,Good book - disappointing ending.,"Started out with a promising plot, the characters were good, I found Scudder's struggle with alcohol to be compelling. Then at some point the book just kind of ended in a way that didn't really tie together anything leading up to it. I just read The Sins of the Fathers which was a better book - the ending wasn't fantastic but better than this book."
5,eight million ways to die,"This is one of my all-time favorite books. If you are new toLawrence Block or his Scudder novels, this is a great place to start."
3,Don't get me wrong: I'm a big fan of Heinlein's. However...,"This book is merely an excerpt of two ""interludes"" from the novel *Time Enough For Love*. While I enjoy many of these quotes, there is not a single ""new"" one in here. They are *all* reprints from that novel.Save yourself a few bucks and buy the novel, instead. You get all of the quotes contained within ""Notebooks"", plus an entire story to go with 'em!I gave this three stars. Heinlein, in general, gets a higher rating from me than that, but this isn't a complete book ."
2,Really? - Just read Time Enough For Love,"This book is just a compilation of quotes from the Lazarus Long character who features prominently in the well known novel Time Enough For Love and a worthy early Heinlein work, Methuselah's Children. The quotes and the character are excellent, but I can see little purpose for this book. Perhaps it has value in that it might lead a reader unfamiliar with Heinlein to read some of his books, many of which are classics in the field. It's of no value to anyone familiar with the master himself...unless you just want a collection of pithy aphorisms."
1,A cheat book for anybody who read the Heinlein book,"I bought this book hoping to get an illustrated edition of the Lazarus Long memoirs. An all I got was an exercise in kaligraphy. Definitely NOT recommended to Heinlein fans,"
2,A poor choice.,"The notebooks of Lazarus Long are a selection of quotes from the books that involve the same character. If you've read the books, you've read the quotes.If you want a collection of his quotes, in huge fonts to make up for the fact that there aren't that many of them, then OK, this book is for you.If you were expecting content, that's another matter entirely, and it is lacking that content."
2,For The Compleat Heinlein TruFan Only ...,"This would be a nice addition to the collection of a total Heinlein fan who just can't get enough of the works of a true SF master; otherwise it is merely a collection of cryptic sayings that are better understood in the context of the book(s) from which they are taken.If you want to understand Heinlein's life philosophy, you should read a variety of his novels.If you want to see his writing at its finest, read his short stories, especially ""All You Zombies"".If you want pithy, useful sayings that give you helpful advice, you should consult to more time-tested sources such as The Book Of Proverbs (the lessons of Lazarus Long were, after all, put in the mouth of a fictional character who increasingly depended on friends with a time machine to pull him out of trouble ... not a resource available to most of you.)But if you are a Trufan of Heinlein, you definitely need this!"
2,Poor guidance,"Heinlein is a recognized master of 20th century sci fi, and I'm among his big fans, especially for the social innovations that he introduced through his novels. But he weaves into his fiction a lot of his own ignorance about realms of existence beyond the physical, and (through his characters' dialogs) rejects even the possibility of those realms, dismissing all energetic healing, shamanic techniques, etc., as foolishness or fraud, conflating spirituality with religion. ""Notebooks"" is not fiction, but a brief compilation of pithy excerpts of philosophical and political musings from those dialogs in other works. Those who know better groan at Heinlein's arrogance at assuming that his ignorance is the final word. Those who are uncertain could easily be misled. Spend your money on Heinlein's fiction (and books on spiritual development, quantum mechanics, etc.), not on this."
2,cute but a pain!,"I purchased it online (because shopping online is easy) for my nursery but was a bit taken aback to discover that it required a battery that could not be located at either CVS or Save-on. An online purchase turned into 2 days of shopping. I then went to Best Buy and they did not carry it either. I finally found the battery at a camera store. It really turned into an ordeal...for a $20 + S&H clock. It is a pretty clock, but seems to be put together shabbily. I could have spent my time shopping for something better."
5,AMAZING for adult acne-prone skin,I'm 30 years old and have suffered from breakouts since my teen years. I recently purchased this product and have been using it in the morning and at night and it is amazing. My skin has changed dramatically. It looks soft and clear for the first time ever. It does not make my skin feel greasy (which I was worried about because it contains shea butter). I highly recommend this product.
1,Shocked,I was shocked and then very disapointed. These men are giants to me and then they release this shallow cop out. Was it for a quick buck? I just don't get it.
1,lame,not good as most people say. his lyrics are wack; most of them don't even make sense. cd is way over rated.
5,What is this man?,"I can't beliave i bought this man. Camron just can't rap, he's not even rappin his just talking. I decided to give him a chance because his last album, come home with me, had three or four good tunes in it, but this, this is one of the worst albums i've ever heard. i think i'll just give this album to one of my friends, there's not point kiping it because i'm not listening to it and maybe someone will like it.But this just isn't my type of rap, i can't wait for 50's new album, hope he can put out some real ****.Anyway, i'm not gonna say don't buy this album, maybe you'll like it, but just listen to it first before you buy it.OUTLAW"
2,Cam should just stop,"There were only two tracks that were outstanding on Cam's over-long album, and they were both produced by Kanye West. The rest of the production is also on point, but Cam's ""mic skills"" do not compliment the slick production and at times, his feeble attempts at rapping are laughable. And you wonder why Nas didn't hit him with an Ether..."
5,BEST SOLO CAM ALBUM YET!,"im tellin you, this cd is well worth whatever its sellin for. i've been waiting for this cd for about a year, and finally it came out. i was not disappointed! the beats and the rhymes are bad as hell. i never thought i'd like ""girls just wanna have fun"" by cindy lauper, but i did when killa cam touched it. this is only a scratch of the surface for what this album really has. probably 10 songs i will listen to for weeks to come. if you like dipset, you have to get this."
2,Really 2/12 stars,"This CD is just OK. Cam's lyrics are on point as usual, but the production choices are poo; except for cuts 7,12, and 17. I'm happy I only paid 99 cents for this."
3,Pick it up. Mainly for the beats and production.,"Never been a huge Cam fan. He fits that mold you see. Cookie cutter mc right up there with a cat named after some loose change. Quite a surprise that I find this cd rotating more then I would have expected. The beats and production I must admit are clean and I can find nothing on the cd which is downright terrible. Cam tries and sometimes succeeds to match his delivery with the tracks provided. Sadly though. Your not going to be amazed by the content of his lyrics. Same tired talk of jewels, women, and guns. Still I would grab it. Fans of Cam are obviously going to love it. Non-fans will still want to get it for the production values."
2,not good,purple haze from cam'ron was not a good cd. since this cd has songs that has poppish beats.
1,Waste of money,"Another album, Another piece of sh#t released. Cam ron aint got no skills. He's another commercial rappa like Gay-z. this album is bull Sh#t n if u like this crap u is a dum a## herb wit no sense in good rap music. Don buy this."
2,WHAT THE HELL!,"This CD sucks. My best friend has it and loves it, but quite frankly i would rather stick a gat in my throat and kill than listen to this piece of sh*t. It has weak ass lyrics and decent beats. Please for God's sake, don't waste your money on this."
2,Weak album,"The single ""Girls"" is a dope song but the rest of the songs suck. Its almost scary really.. The album is pretty boring and the lyrics are no good."
4,Get 'Em Killa,"Cam'ron has changed alot over the years! I recently listened to his first album, while the beats where decent his flow was a-ight! Fast forward a few years and albums, Killa is definitely ""down with the roc, and lord of his set""! The only track that I didn't like is track number 6 (leave me alone Pt.2)! Other than that, you can put the whole album in and just kick back and relax! The beats are slammin, plus with a MUCH IMPROVED flow, killa is up 50, buck 50, who can (if you don't know the rest of lyric, check out the album to complete the line)!"
4,4 and 1/2 STARS!!!!!,"Cam'ron fans will love this new album plain and simple. He does what has always done but just a little better. Some people are getting on here and giving it bad reviews probably because they arent Camron fans. But if you are a fan and you havnet got the album..... go and get it now, there are some hot joints on here.An album with 24 tracks.... about 6 skits, thats 18 songs... all are listenable but some stand out more than others; really depending on your own personal style and opinion (but like stated before all Cam'ron fans will love this album) Some of my favorites are:2- More Gangsta Music feat Juelz Santana3- Get Down5 - Killa Cam (my personal Favorite)7- Down and Out feat. Kanye West10- Girls (you should have seen the video by now)12-Soap Opera20-Hey Lady21-Shake22-Get Em Girls23- Dip-Set Forever24- Take Em to Chruch feat Juelz SantanaThats 11 favorites out of 18 songs.... not bad considering the others are solid tracks as well. GO GET THIS ALBUM!!!!"
2,"Please Cam, by a dictionary","The beats on this CD are great and Cam's flow is exceptional, that all said, the album blows. Its twenty something tracks of the same non-sensical crap Cam has been putting out. Nothing makes sense, no direction, no consistency and no metaphors or depth whatsoever. He does not make sense, it sounds like a Doctor Suess book on crak being read over a beat, dont expect anything out of this."
2,the Roc needs to give me a refund,"My review Is quick, and easy. Listened to purple haze, moved my head to Kanye West tracks, and then tossed it out the window in Target's parking lot. A CD that only has 2 decent tracks, and talks about drugs, ignorance, and violence this much could have been recorded in a 1 hour freestyle session. If you want real rap check out Immortal technique Revolutionary Vol.2"
3,the pink power ranger strikes back!!!,"""I was obsessed with Cookie, I wanna sex her cookieShe said forget her nookie, wipe my nose, go get them boogies""- who else can spit that and get away wit that nonsense, only killa. If you lookin for lyrical content, then you obvioulsy are in need of some serious help, pick it up for the beats, and a few skits are good for a chuckle. Probably one of killa's better albums but i don't see him gettin any better than this."
1,Not a killa just wack!!!,"Do you really believe cam is a ""killa""? He is as much a ""killa"" as ""murder mase"". LOL!!!!! Cam is wack plan and simple. His whole camp are the worst rappers in the industry. Yeah Kanye may have laced the album with dope beats but that is the only element that is dope. Instead of wasting those beats, kanye should have saved them for an artist that has quality lyrics. To make it easy for people to understand, Cam is a BEAT WASTER. He gets dope beats and wastes them by putting his super wack rhymes on it."
3,Cam'ron... Im not sure...,"Cam'ron has got that aquired taste. It's appearent either you'll hate him or love him. His flow and way of emcee'ing is quite different and not many would be willing to like it.Personally I like cam'ron and santana whom have the same flow. Benzino is gay tho. This album was alright... I mean theres some songs on there that are pretty dope... then others which are complete garbage. Alot of these beats are straight, real different, not so commercial sounding... production is cool. Some songs tho they took it a little too far with the samples making them sound kinda lame.SOmetimes Cam'ron has some boom-boom lines, [...]... like he didnt put any thought into it... but overall he's alright...This album is OK. I wouldnt get it if you dont know camron or dont like him."
4,cam is crazy!!!,"From his first lp to this one, cam's flow has change a lot. On this album cam does more solo's then his last lp and has added more tracks, which helps it a lot, but the delay really hurt the hype on the album. Over all though the album is really hot and is worth the charge. Hot trackz are harlem streets, get em girls, down and out, soap opera, bubble music, adrenaline, hey lady, take em to church and dip set forever."
4,This Album is HOT,"Yo his lyrical Skills are not that GREAT but his PRODUCERS hooked him up. The Beats are the hottest out on the racks. Tracks ""killa cam"" n ""down n out"" are the fire on ther!!!His beats are ridiculous~~~ i feel this album ""yellow stones u can call dem lemon heads"""
5,This ishh is HOT!!!! Cop it,"If you don't have this cd by now you are kinds of late. This album was straight and the funny skits and characters like Mizzle makes the album unique. He spit well but not on one thing thru out the song like other rappers like Nas, or Pac. His lines are crazy for example on the song Hey Lady he says Just kissed the nob, and put your meat on my stick like a shish-ka-bob, Out mingalin', heard that I blingy-bling, But I run the circus like ring-a-ling, I'm the king of things, and your man he a homo like jing-a-ling jing-a-lingThis man is ill an if he keep working like dis he can tear up the hip hop industy in half and stomp on it.Favorite Songs*Hey Lady*Girls*Dip Set Forever*Family Ties*Get Em Girls*Bubble Music*Down and Out"
4,A Guilty Pleasure - 4+ stars.,"This album is like candy for hip-hop lovers in a good way: sweet, unsubstantial, and satisfying. Over infections, 80's pop tunes Killa Cam makes the most of each beat. Hip-hop does not always need to address the wrongs in society - sometimes it is enough just to have fun. Cam's off-the-cuff tales of womanizing and drug-selling are of course present, but they are secondary to his amazing alliterative wordplay. On some songs it seems like he is determined to test the English language's boundaries, and go just beyond them. This cd will not change your life, but it is a decent album to bump in the car. Personal favorites are Killa Cam (with a chorus that will stay in your head for days), Hey Lady (infectious beat), and Girls. Check this cd out if for you sometimes the music can be more important than the message. DipSET!"
4,ITS A GUILTY PLEASURE,THIS IS AN AIGHT LP AND IT'S NOTHING THAT TYPICAL OR POLITICAL AND ITS CHANGE FROM THOSE TYPE STUFF SO I GUESS I CAN DEAL WITH THE DIPSET
3,Best of Diplomats?,"If you blow past the bass induced beats of the Diplomats, you'll find some of the worst lyrics in rap. Cam'Ron is the best of Diplomats. I'll give him that, but the Diplomats aren't even that great. They're mostly about lyrics that mean absolutely nothing (especially Juelz Santana). Cam'Ron's highley anticipated 5th solo album is probably his best. It features cuts with Kanye West, Just Blaze, and of course his loyal crew Diplomats. Despite the confusing interludes and outros, the songs are pretty nice. They're similar to his previous album ""Come Home With Me"". From the hardcore ""Adrenaline"" to the carefree ""Harlem Streets"", and of course the over-played, over rated ""Get Em' Girls"". The album is usual, but you can't expect much out of the diplomats."
3,Purple Haze Losses Its High,"Nearly one year in the process, it seemed that Cam'Ron's new album would never come out. With delay after delay ,it would seem his album would come out with fresher material, but some of his songs were put out many mixtapes ago such as killa cam, hey lady, get 'em girls, and harlem streets. Accompanying useless skits, stale lyrical flow and the same beats we have heard 4 years ago, it seems cam'ron's career may be slipping. Some shining moments on the album are the reggae influnced more gangsta music with juelz santana and the Kanye West produced down and out."
4,"""2 more for Cam' for taking over the Roc.""","After almost a year of anticipation ""Purple Haze"" finally drops, and it drops hard. Cam' delivers another classic, gully from beginning to end. ""Purple Haze"" displays Cam's ever-progressing lyrical talent over a string of heavy beats. If you liked the Diplomat albums then this one's for you. Cam'ron's origional flow and lyical talent have obviously come a long way since he first dropped in '98 and he shows this by stringing together tight, constant lyrics through out many of the track on this album. ""Purple Haze"" is more distinguished than previous release ""Come Home With Me"" and shows the development of the origional ""Dip-set"" that they are known for.Cam's found his niche, n with Ma$e back in the game, Harlems back on top.If your a serious rap fan, you can't miss this one.""2 more for Cam' for taking over the Roc.""Peace"
3,Got Purple?,"When I buy albums I ask myself: Do the title go with the album? Cam already confuses me on this one. I know purple haze mean weed but is there a hidden metaphor for this album that the listener is missing? This album is a hit or miss, sort of like Shaq freethrows. He got some songs that make you say oh sh&#, then he got some songs that make you say damn he's brave for redoing that song. Some people gripe about Killa's lyrics but I think he's dope. If everybody rap the same then everybody would sell the same amount of units ya feel me? What can I say, the album is decent. It's worth a purchase for all you Amazon junkies!"
4,Cute story,"I thought this was a cute story about the anticipation of advent told through a child's eyes. It wasn't exactly what I expected, but it was cute."
1,[Weak],"""Punch"" is a pathetically bad movie with no likable characters: The father is weak and subconsciously wants to bed his daughter, the girlfriend is wimpish and desperate, and her sister is violent.The one character we should have sympathy for is the daughter, but she has no redeeming qualities. She is deeply psychologically disturbed and wants to have sex with her father. She's violent and has severe anger problems. The father should have recognized this - but seems unaware all the way to the end. It's unbelievable that the daughter wasn't forced to have counseling. In the movie, it's never even considered as a means to help the girl.The film-makers seem to believe that receiving a good beating or giving a good beating is the way to solve deep rooted psychological problems. A notion in itself which is very disturbing."
4,Fists (among other apendages) of fury.,"lnteresting, erotic and yet a bit disturbing. You try to have sympathy for Ariel, but she is too much of a [...] to give it to her. Sure the topless boxing is nice, even though one lady l'd rather see her with her shirt on, but there is a very interesting story around it. l was shocked to find out that the lady who played Ariel is the director's daughter. Why would any Father subject their daughter to a near full frontal nudity scene? The title is appropriate because the story line really hits you, hard."
5,essential book for learning and learning to teach net making,"easily read text, clear illustrations, and fool proof step by step instructions from shopping bags to crab pots to hammocks. includes a section on basic knot tying."
3,A very touching story,This book is a book i would recommend to readers who can face a story with plot were the main character is suffering.
1,Avoid - Horrible Quality,"My daughter had been asking and asking for a Lilo doll. Since none are being currently made by Disney, I found this set on Amazon. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere as these are very substandard. Not even sure how they can use the Disney name on the tags. Just like the previous reviewer stated, these are ""carnival quality"" -- avoid!"
1,Disappointed,"I ordered this set of Lilo and Stitch for our daughter's birthday. She's a huge Lilo and Stitch fan. This set is a BIG disappointment however. They're cheaply made, and right on the package it says, ""Not for resale"". They're like carnival toys...Really bad!"
1,Not as described,"The tubing is fine, but the product description leads a person to believe that it is a solid, non-split, tube... which is what I wanted. What I got was a split tube like any number of others on the market. Disappointing to say the least."
4,"review of ""A Shelter in the Storm""","I had the opportunity to study under Dr. Fallin at the University of Montevallo in Montevallo, AL. The material covered in his book is highly informative and accurate. The details that Dr. Fallin covered are extensive and the book paints a highly accurate description of the role of black churches in their struggle to obtain true independance in the South."
2,promotional disappointment,"As much as I admire David Copperfield's skill, originality, charisma and innovation, I must admit that I was quite disappointed with this biography. First of all, it is mostly promotional and totally superficial. There is no insight into the character and no critique. As a DVD it was sent to me on DVD-R format with no extra features and no chapter menus as a professional DVD should be. The chapter points are haphazard and go right through the commentary at random points. This is just a copy on DVD of the TV programme with no proper authoring."
5,Great for Very Young Babies,"This book is the absolute best I have found for very young babies. I discovered when babysitting my then three-month-old nephew that he would stare at the babies in this book for a long time, especially given his age. When I got pregnant, I bought a copy for my daughter and she reacted the same way to this book that my nephew did. We started reading it to her when she was only a few weeks old, and for several months this was her favorite book--she got very excited each time we read it to her, and she'd often let us read it to her two or even three times through. That's a huge feat for a newborn! This is part of a series, and I have to say that this book was the best; the others didn't have as many pictures of babies, and that's really what seemed to enrapture my little one."
2,"Very original, but falls quite short","Well where to begin?What it has going for it: Very original, good animation, gory, gritty story line, a lot of nudity(if that's your thing)what's NOT going for it: Crappy action scenes, infuriatingly stupid characters, unlikable characters, really dumb unfulfilling ending.I gave it 2 stars for good animation, original story line, and (largely failed) potential. I'm sure if they kept the general story, but cut out damn near everything else they would have had decent show."
3,"not the worst, but far from the best","I watched every episode of gantz, waiting for that moment where it took off and developed. Instead, it's just gratuitous violence and nudity, and then it simply ends. No explanation of any part of the story at all, the main character has hardly moved past his selfish narcissism from the start of the series, just...nothing."
5,"A dark, creative story.","I would like to start off by saying that this anime is clearly not for any one that likes happy bunnies, and silly things that make you laugh. This is a very heart wrenching experince that will keep you on your toes with anticipation of the things to come. There is some nudity, but the nudity wasnt there just for kicks, it was there for charcter development. This is a very interesting anime worthy of checking out.(Plus its alittle bit bloody)"
2,Why did everyone LOVE this title????,"Really people, 5 stars? While the plot of Gantz seems like it would make a great series, what was achieved in two seasons could have been done in two DVDs. I kept wanting to yell at the TV, ""GET ON WITH IT!"" I wanted to know more about the characters and I wanted to see how they would overcome this strange situation they were thrust into and I wanted to see more monsters. But alas, all I got was DBZ feeling fights going on for many episodes and endlessly whining characters.The art in Gantz is beautiful. The concept is so cool. The characters are rich and feeling. It just takes too long to get to the point and then leaves you empty with a confusing ending and bad plot holes.Definatly NOT 5 stars."
1,What a Waste,"From the episodes that I saw, the series goes as such; the main character dies, he meets up with a few other dead people and a dead dog, they fight for their life and die again including the dog. The End.I felt the series was a waste."
2,"Great concept, really bad execution","The most frustrating aspect of this series is when you're yelling at the screen for the fools to get on with their task... and you will do this for EVERY episode. The characters do a lot of standing around talking and, depending on whether the plot requires it or not, the villains will either patiently wait for them to finish, or take advantage of the inaction and kill someone.While on missions, none of the characters react to their particular situations in a manner that is even imaginably believable. Yet, when they are returned to their normal lives, the story shifts to an endearingly humanistic spectrum. It is during these times that the writing is the best. Still, the mystery of Gantz is suppose to be the most compelling, but sadly, the writing in these areas just falls apart.Aside from all that, the artwork is top-notch and the action, as rare as it may be, is pretty good."
4,A triumph!,"This book was like a hybrid of two of my favorite books - ""Arctic Dreams"" by Barry Lopez, and ""Into Thin Air"" by Jon Krakhauer. It brought back memories of my boyhood in Seattle dreaming about the adventure of someday climbing this ever present entity. I felt the wet slap of rain soaked branches of the coastal forest as I read through this. I had always heard about the air crash of marines buried on the Mountain, and now that I have read about it I feel the Mountain's mystique even more. Thanks Bruce."
2,lost interest,"Some parts of the book were great, but overall I thought it was overwritten and I became bored on many chapters that were just rambling I felt. It had some interesting stories, but most I could have done without. Not exactly what I was expecting about hiking the mountain."
3,The Measure of a Mountain: Beauty and Terror on Mount Rainier,"Often rambling and a bit too poetic for my taste, this book is full of interesting facts and stories on the mountain and the people spending time on it. Don't expect a thorough discussion on any of the topics the book touches, or an answer to the author's quest to find out what makes people want to climb mountains, and you might end up enjoying the book. I'm still not quite sure why I read this book: Perhaps because it's there?"
2,No desire to vist Ranier after this,"After slogging through this overwritten and overwrought account of the author's obsession with Mr. Rainier, I lost what little interest I had in ever visiting the place. The mountain is painted as dreary and gray, with grimy little spots of human encroachment. The only moderately interesting part of the book are the chapters on the Himalayas and high altitude climbing, which, if Barcott stayed on point, would not even be in the book. No wonder his girlfriend got fed up with him; he is not just a bore, he is a bore with an ill-defined and pointless obsession."
3,"A ""nice to have in your archive""","It's a nice dvd explaining very (may be too) briefly how some of the very memorable photos of National Geography photographers are prepared and shot. Also, it's possible to catch a glimpse of what type of gadgets are used by professional photographers. Previously, I watched ""National Geographic's Photographers"" and I think the level of detail and the length of each section was more appropriate. Also, it gave more insight on the difficulties and pleasures of shooting photos for National Geography. This one is quite short.But still, I am happy to purchase and watch this DVD. Being a serious amateur photographer, I believe I made the right decision to include it in my archive."
4,Never going to share this DVD,"This DVD features some of the best photographs from the National Geographic Magazine along with well documented experiences that went into the making.Just wish some of the stories were longer. Was also hoping the photographers would give away some technical details.Never the less, with the quality of content, you cant complain too much."
2,Superficial,"As somebody on the border between being an amateur/pro photographer I felt this was far too superficial to be useful. There was more information on volcanoes and sharks than on camera equipment, technique, or the photographers themselves.How to plan an organize a trip? What gear to take? How to deal with the logistics of such projects? How to approach projects of this caliber? How to deal with ethical issues on a shoot? How to become a NatGeo photographer? Not in this DVD.If you want a too-short overview of a few not-so-famous NatGeo photos, go for it. If you want to really see what it takes to be a (pro) photographer (for NatGeo) forget it."
5,A beautifully written guide to soul searching,"I always enjoy reading Whyte's work. Few writers have equaled his command of the English language and his story-telling ability. The book evokes a great deal of empathy as many modern day workers struggle to find personal meanings to work/employment. Whyte provides a personal insight into how one may purposefully stay true to oneself. The reading is relatively lighter than most of his poetic works and is very enjoyable and thought provoking. If one doesn't like the content, he/she will at least enjoy the author's mastery in writing, especially his transitions from one point to another. Whyte is one of the few authors that can weave together difficult concepts with artistic cohesiveness and elegance. Highly recommend it."
2,"A bit generalized, a bit narrow","This is definitely right for folks looking for good observations on abandoning work and finding something you've always dreamed of, but it is not as useful for someone in a pretty good line of work, or field they love, searching for attitudes and approaches to make that long stretch of middle career feel more meaningful, worthwhile, and well balanced. His method is to extrapolate from his personal career switch, which, by becoming a guide in the galapagos, was fairly extreme. It seemed almost cliche the way the danger and near misses helped him find himself, his true values...just not new enough insights for my reading perspective."
4,A helluva guy,"But so enigmatic -- some readers think he's irish, some think he's welsh, some think he lives in New Zealand. Actually he's from Yorkshire, England, and lives near Seattle, but what the hell -- he's still a helluva guy."
4,A new view of work,"I came across this book in the New Books section of my local library and the title intrigued me enough to take it home. I am always looking for books on work as I write a weekly high-tech careers column.Whyte's style can be a bit ""grand"" at times, one of the hazards of a poet writing prose, but there are some very important ideas to be found here. Several times I found myself pausing suddenly to contemplate a line I had just read that effected me deeply. This book needs to be taken in small doses, allowing time to ruminate and absorb what you read.If you are looking for a book with a unique take on the nature of work in the 21st Century, you would be well-served to pick this one."
1,BAD DEAL.,IT BROKE ON OUR WEDDING DAY SO I COULDN'T GET A PICTURE OF THE CAKE...LAME. I HAD TO BUY THEM SEPARATELY BECAUSE MY HUSBAND IS WHITE AND I AM BLACK AND MOST PLACES AREN'T UP TO SPEED ON THINGS LIKE THIS SO THIS WAS THE ONLY PLACE I COULD GET ONE WITH OUT PAYING ARM AND A LEG.
4,So the Hidden Levels Drive You NUTS...........,"Before tossing this one in the trash, know that there is an easier way to access the extras. Delightful and funny documentary of a very decent bar band. Crowe's voice isn't Pavorotti, but it is passable, especially on songs meant to rock. Not cracked up with his balladeering, but there is an interesting rap type track of a little song called ""Nowhere"".Now to those harder than hell to get to levels. DVDs like Texas have titles and chapters. Most DVD player remotes come with a display button. Hit the display button and navigate the titles starting with 1 then 2 and so forth through 20. It is a very easy way to get around this DVD without going through all those inane instructions. I really don't know who's idea the levels were, but they must have been in some sort of dream state."
1,Watching this DVD will give you a full blown stress attack,"I personally love Russell Crowe and 30 Odd Foot of Grunts. My excitment in receiving this DVD was soon a great disapointment. With the DVD come four pages of instructions on how to navigate throughout the DVD to see all of the features. Some of the insutructions were very detailed including looking for hidden codes in the credits section of the four page booklet. If you were unable to successfully navigate to a certain section, you were denied access. I did not spend almost $30.00 on a DVD where I have to work so hard to figure out how to watch the DVD. I am VERY disappointed with this product, and I urge others not to buy it. My husband and I screwed around with this ridiculous DVD for almost four hours and still could not access all of the features. The features are all encrypted and encoded, and a huge pain in the [rear]. Save your money. And Russell, please forgive me for slamming this piece of garbage."
3,Patience,It takes a while to be able to view all the DVD has to offer but it is worth it. Working thru the puzzles added more to the experience than just staring at the toob.
3,"Like TOFOG, HAAAATE the way they did this DVD","I really liked the Texas documentary, their music and energy live in concert was really very engaging to watch--it suited their music much better than a CD where they come off sounding kind of amateurish. The 60 Odd Hours in Italy documentary was sort of funny too, and not too difficult to get to. [...]The outtakes within the Texas feature were better than any of the bonus stuff BY FAR!!Wish they had just stuck to the main feature which was quite energizing and entertaining."
4,Russell Crowe rocks!,"This video is great as far as the music and an eye-opening backstage view of prepairing for a concert and making & a video while simultaneously starring in a major motion picture. Its only drawback is the ""layering"" technique for additional material. It is distracting from whatever portion you are watching to be on the lookout for little symbols that tell you to ""drill down"" for something else. There is also no listing to tell you what the other layers are so, even after watching it many times, I'm still not sure if I've missed something. They should have just done a normal index to everything. Still and all, Russell and TOFOG rock!"
3,Could be so much better,"The book has more acronyms than you can shake a stick at, far more than you would ever want to know, but the definitions are of mixed quality and often too chatty to precisely clarify the idea. More length on fewer topics would have made for a more useful book, but so many pages are given over to numbingly obscure material while big subjects get the same couple of paragraphs. On the other hand, it is a dictionary and if you accept it is only a starting point for investigation rather than the book that is really going to explain what you need to know, then it's an occasionally handy reference."
5,"Terms, words, and concepts relevant to telecommunications","Now in a completely updated, revised and expanded seventeenth edition, the Newton's Telecom Dictionary continues to be an invaluable dictionary of terms, words, and concepts relevant to telecommunications, networking and the Internet. One particular virtue of this immensely useful reference is Harry Newton's introduction ""Where The Telecom, Networking, Fiber, Internet, Web Explosion Is Taking Us"". No professional, academic, or community library computer or Internet reference collection can be considered up-to-date without the inclusion of this latest edition of Newton's Telecom Dictionary as a core title."
2,Official????,"The Attributes that I dislike about this book far outnumber the ones that I find likeable. It has an extroardinary number of definitions however most of them do nothing more than point out the obvious. The author obviously avoids technical detail. Since I bought this book I have been thrilled everytime I find a definition, but then let down by the lack of detail, and excess of ambiguity. My wish is for Mr. Newton the author, to add more detailed definitions in the next edition. The Encyclopedia of Telecommunications (McGraw Hill)is a richly detailed book, but does not have nearly as many entries as this one. If you can afford it, get them both."
4,Superior Dictionary worth its' weight in gold!,I was first introduced to Newton's TeleCom Dictionary while serving as a MARS Operator aboard U.S.S. England (CG-22) in the early to mid-80's. This book is exactly what it purports to be - a dictionary for modern day Telecom professionals. It is not designed to fully explain concepts of Telecommunications - rather it is designed to serve as a basic reference for those times when you quickly need to know the meaning of an acronym. From the definition contained in Newton's you can then move on to more in-depth sources of information. A neat feature are the updates via Internet. This book covers a vast and broad area and does it extremely well. It should be a standard reference for all CT and IT professionals. Well worth the price.
4,Jiggle valve,"No outer flange air bleed ""jiggle valve,"" but a small ""v"" cut into inner valve flange for air bleed.Didn't install as I tested the existing Kuzeh thermostat on the stove in hot water with a gauge thermostat and it still works fine opening at 180F. But, in comparison, this Stant sure seems rather a cheap design verses the Kuzeh (PN W0133-1628507-KUZ)."
4,fun baby learning book,i bought this for my freinds grand daughter....who is alert and advanced for her age at 8 months old... she took to it after a couple of sessions and already she is communicating a few words...amazing...the book is well equipped with flash cards and great colors and babies love it
2,Poorly translated stories,"I don't really like this book. Although the illustration is quite appealing, with a unique Korean accent in all the drawings, the stories are poorly translated. There are many strange or clumsy sentences and inappropriate use of words, and words that are difficult for young children to understand. The book isn't geared toward user-friendliness for the young readers."
3,not so famous Korean folk stories,"I was born and grew up in Korea until I was 15, I'm not so familiar with these stories though. Translation was not done well either."
1,dissatisfied,I never recieved the book and i haven't got a answer back from the buyer. I am not satisfied with the purchase.
3,Mixed Feelings,"I have both the book and the video. For a beginner, they are very helpful. The one flaw with the video are the tabs at the bottom of the screen to play along. They only show two measures and don't advance until the last note is played. By the time you read the new tabs, Bert is two or three notes into it. If you don't already have the notes partially memorized from the book, it is hard to keep up. If you already know the song, the tabs are irrelevent.The book alone is great. The book and video work great together. Don't buy just the video alone."
4,Wasted Youth??,"Wastedm, hits home by showing the insanity of heroin use amoung teens. Heroin use is becoming very prevelent amoung middle class suburbanites, and the movie accuratley depicts the motions of addiction. It seems that MTV made a movie based on my life. Furthermore, the movie is a very dramatic, heartfelt peice of art."
3,wasted,i liked this movie . It really touched me and showed me how far some kids will go to keep friends. i think it was well done with great acting .nick stahl was great one of his best movies
1,Not for me,This story did not really grab and hold my interest or my 4 year olds. Just missed the mark for us.
4,"Great ""back to school"" book!","This is a fun ""back to school"" book with a twist. The main character is asked to write about his summer vacation and he chooses to write something that is obviously fiction. He tells about being kidnapped by cowboys and spends the summer with them instead of with his aunt. I read this book to my second graders on the first day of school and they love it.Part of the way through the book I start hearing comments from them such as ""he's not telling the truth"", and ""he's just kidding"". There are many fun activities that can be done using this book as a springboard. I usually have my students write about their summer vacation and it can be the truth or it can be fiction. After their writing is complete they share it with the class and we guess whether it is the truth, or like the boy in the book, fiction."
4,: ),"I wish I had a vacation as interesting as this kid!When giving his BORING report about his BORING vacation... wait, no, that was somebody else. This kid's vacation included being kidnapped. By COWBOYS! And having to stop a cattle stampede! And being a hero!Good rhymes, great fun, and cute ending with a bull in time for show-and tell. Anybody who's had to suffer through the first day of school blues should get a copy :)"
4,Persuasive but not convincing,"When I read this book in July of 1968 I became convinced that the popular vote should determine the election. I no longer believe this. If it did, the federal system which we live under would be seriously changed. Small states would lose importance, and campaigners would spend even more of their time in the areas where there are lots of people. It would constitute a drastic change in the system which has served us well for most of our history. If there should be a change, we should eliminate the possibility of ""faithless electors"" and in case of no majority we should let the House pick the President, instead of giving the House only one vote as is presently the case."
5,DeFrancesco Rocks!,"As a fan of the Hammond B3, all I can say about this live performance is wow! DeFrancesco really brings it in this live performance. In sports athletes are often told to leave it all on the field and win, lose, or draw, if you did your best you win regardless. Well, DeFrancesco leaves it all on the stage with his performance on this cd. Simply put, he rocked the house with this performance. From the first track through the last this cd was smoking! My favorite track is the old Diz tune ""The Champ."" If you love the Hammond B3 and are a DeFrancesco fan, this cd is a must for your collection."
1,Arrogant Relativist,"Like another reviewer here, I too felt his book spiral down in the latter chapters. The penultimate insult was when the young lady in Mozambique said she would pray for him and he had the audacity to basically say..""F Off"" in so many words. I never finished the book after that."
4,Editing mistakes,"I really enjoyed this book (like all the others of Theroux that I have read) as it I could really imagine the places that he went to. Theroux's insight and observations are fascinating.The only criticism I have is that we do not know how long it took him to complete his journey. Or did he perhaps interrupt his travels?I also found it quite disturbing that there were a few editing mistakes: the Big Five does not include the giraffe but consists of the elephant, lion, leopard, buffalo and rhinoceros. A freeway in Afrikaans is not a ""vryweg"" but a ""hoofweg"".He also tends to repeat himself a bit. Perhaps some tighter editing in the next edition is called for."
4,Not exactly an uplifting book...,"I thought that Paul Theroux's book was a wonderful read, although slow and pessimistic in some areas. The conversations with locals are wonderful, although I dislike the idea that he insults foreign aid workers and missionaries. This book is definately not for the light at heart, but I recommenend it none-the-less."
2,Misanthropic Safari,"I read this book before a recent extensive trip to Kenya and Tanzania. I had never been to Africa before so the book, in large part, shaped my expectations of African people and society. I took it for granted that I would be robbed, maybe even as soon as I arrived at the airport. I even went so far as to wear ragged clothing and carry a cheap bag, in order not to make myself a target. Now that I have returned from my trip, I wonder whether the author and I visited the same continent. The people I met were warm and friendly. I never felt threatened and, to my surprise, was never robbed. Now I see that the author had an overly negative point of view regarding Africa, especially Kenya. I suppose every society has its good and bad sides. Unfortunately, the author focused all of his attention on the bad and ignored all that is good about Africa. This is probably a reflection of him and his own pitiful view of life and people, than an accurate depiction of the continent."
5,Theroux!,"I enjoyed The Great Railway Bazaar more than this one but, in my book, Theroux still ranks as one of the finest writers of this generation. I own all his titles and hope he is at work on the next."
2,Not a Really Good Comedy!!,"To me, this movie should be rated XXX!! The only thing in this movie is really jusy nudity, and lots and lots of profanity.I think the idea of men looking at women taking showers is pointless!!"
5,Time to LYAO with this one,"I have seen this movie more times than I care to admit to. I lmao each time I watch it too. The bit between kong and Turner in several areas of the movie (case in point the 10 gallon condom bit). The tallywagger scene with kong, Miss Honeywell going up against Kong, the Coach Brackett and Honeywell, the scene of Porkys being demolished and various others. This is one for all of us who do not need help with a vivid imagination, as it just puts fuel on the fire as it is. Lead these kids not into temtation as they can find it themselves."
1,The video with additional visual material cut out,"Buyer beware. If you think this is the widescreen theatrical version, it's not. This ""widescreen"" version takes the video version and lops off even more visual material. If you're looking for something closer to what was actually released in theaters, get the VHS version, because this DVD only ""perseves the aspect ratio of its orginal theatrical exhibition."" It's not the orginal theatrical exhibition."
3,Somewhat dorky and intermittently funny,"Somehow, I thought this movie was funnier in my memory. Now that I've seen it again, I see that it's mostly a cliched comedy, with a bunch of jerks and dorks who are hard to sympathize with. The only exceptions are the Jewish fellow, Brian, and the cop who helps his brother and pals get revenge after Porky and his pals beat them up.Crass humor abounds, Miss Honeywell earns her legendary nickname of Lassie, the description of the wanted poster for the male private part is somewhat amusing, and there is an explosive yet somehow anticlimactic ending.Okay for a few laughs at most. There are much stronger 1980s comedies to be seen, however."
1,Funny coming of age movie. Horrible DVD print,"This movie is funny in an old fashioned way, but the DVD quality of the film print is a noisy, messy looking print. It should be cleaned up for DVD to get rid of the pixels and video noise."
4,FORGET ''AMERICAN PIE'' WATCH THIS CULT CLASSIC,"IN THIS VERY RAUNCHY COMEDY, A GROUP OF TEENAGERS SNEAK INTO A STRIP CLUB AND WHEN THEY GET ROBBED OF THEIR MONEY BY THE OWNER, THEY ALL PLOT REVENGE. I'M WARNING YA, RIGHT NOW, PARENTS, IF YOU HAVE THIS MOVIE, KEEP THIS MOVIE SOMEWHERE YOUR KIDS CAN'T GET TO IT BECAUSE THIS MOVIE HAS A LOT OF NUDITY, INCLUDING MALE FRONTAL NUDITY. BUT OTHER THAN THAT, IT'S A STRAIGHT UP FUNNY MOVIE ABOUT TEENAGE LIFE IN THE 50S. EVEN AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, THIS MOVIE IS STILL FUNNY AND ENTERTAINING. FOLLOWED BY TWO SEQUELS."
5,A Classic Comedy thats still funny today,"Porky's is one of the greatest comedy films I've ever seen! Straight away at the begining of the film you are introduced to the one of the films main characters 'Pee Wee' who's a person who wants a girl but nobody wants him! the film is hilarious, rowdy and raunchy, and has the insight into the zany antics of six sex-mad American teenagers. They all decide to travel to Porky's, which is a club where amorous daydreaming can become a night-time reality, which turns into a big mistake and the film is based around getting there own back! The funniest part of the film for me is when 'Pee Wee' and two mets sneek into a secret passage in the wall to spy on the girls in the shower! (Pee Wee) gets very excited and somebody gets a little pain given to them because of there cheek! overall it's a great film which you should buy even if you haven't seen it, you will be well awarded! The film is a comedy of all comedy, and still is known as one of the greats!"
2,Not very funny,"I know that there are a lot of people who disagree, but this video doesn't cut it. It is simply a teen exploitation film put together by a bunch of adults with actors in their early twenties pretending to be high school kids. Even the famous revenge scene seems forced and takes forever to happen.Okay, if I'm going to dump on it, what do I think is better? TryThe Hollywood Knights. It's full of the good-natured obscene humor that is the American high school experience."
2,"Old and Dated, Overhaul Needed","I first saw this movie on TV in 1986. I must confess that I thought it was the funniest movie ever. Maybe it was because I was 18 then or perhaps back then anything with sex and teens with humour sells. I had the opportunity of seeing Porkys again in 2001 with a my 18 year old nephew. Sad to say, the movie held up poorly over time. Neither of us thought it was funny. I was especially embarassed as I had recommended it so highly. The acting was awful, situations contrived. I must say that American Pie is a much better movie."
3,Fun,"Well, ""fun"" isn't the best descriptor I've ever come up with but Porky's is precisely that--and a little less. It's not what one would call a deep or engrossing movie though. It lacks the complexity and genius of an Animal House or a Stripes, but it certainly is a good time. Porky's is rather topical due to Sex and the City's recent release because, as a young woman, Kim Cattrall was every bit as sexy as the press suggest. Her Miss Honeywell is a character you'll long remember. Although I did not like the ending, I appreciated its fifties feel and have reached the point in my life where I really enjoy looking at classic cars. Porky's is no masterpiece but it is a hearty giggle."
3,You will like this if you were PeeWee in high school,"this movie is for those who could not get any in high school, as exemplified by the character PeeWee, so named because of his little nubber. Booger likes this movie a lot because he identifies with PeeWee, both in manhood size and inability to score. You just know nerds like Booger keep using that Mike Hunt line whereever they go, destined to relive their sad lives via these 80s teen movies, which they watch on old VHS tapes in their mommy's basement well into their 30s......snickering at ribald jokes and creating masturbatory fantasies to fill up the lame voidness that is their lives now....."
1,Retained Mode is Dead,"Why write a book about D3D RM. It's dead, Microsoft dropped it. Makes this book a big pass."
1,"Out of date, Garbage book","I was very disappointed to read this book, because this book istalking about DirectX7.Even in 2000, when the book published, DirectX7 was already out of date. Now we use DirectX9 or 10.Therefore this book is useless for readers if they want to study 3D Graph programming"
2,what happened to the good ole stuff!!,Humm all I want to say is what happened to a good ole historical romance..I'm tired of all this contempory murder mystery stuff that all my favorite authors seem to write these days..just a good all historical book about the poor (but very attractive) poor girl that meets the rich tall dark and handsome duke... that's all i ask..that's just me though..
2,Disappointed again,"Boring, boring, boring. I am so glad I waited for the library copy. Except for ""Someone To Watch Over Me"", I have not enjoyed any of Ms. McNaught's contemporary novels. I adore her historical novels, ""Kingdom of Dreams"" is perhaps my hands down favorite historical romance but these contemporary ones....yeesh..The women are so weak. I'm still mad at Meredith Bancroft taking crap from her brother's secrtary !So folks, get it at the library and save your money."
4,A Friend Lent Me This Book.,"Since a friends lent me the book, I said I would try and read it. I really enjoyed this book, but it was a Hard Cover book not a kindle. So it was not easy for me to read, I like anything on a kindle because I can read in bed. It is very difficult to read a hard cover book in bed. I did love the story a good plot, a good mystery, good love scenes."
5,One of her better books,"If you're a fan of Judith McNaught, this is a must have addition to your collection. Like many of her other books it focuses on rich and powerful people who step all over folks in love (a la Merdith & Matt or Julie & Zach). A great read!"
3,Typical Romance,This book is OK. Once in a while I want to read something really light. This book filled the bill very nicely.
3,Lukewarm version of Paradise,"I thought that the characters were likeable in the first half of the book. But once Kate and Mitchell had parted company in the hopes that they would see each other that evening, that's when things go downhill. The Fact that Kate actually believed all the lies about Mitchell was ridiculous! That they would see each other again after 3 years under those circumstances was unbelievable. I didn't care for the ending either. It was too abrupt:(. I have read all of Judith McNaught's books and have enjoyed all of them----this was definitely not her best work."
4,"Great read, not the best McNaught...","I enjoyed this book, particularly the extended version. Mitchell and Kate were lovely, and I enjoyed Julie and Zach, although I wish there would have been more of them! Mitchell is the typical McNaught hero, but I happen to LOVE her men. Honestly, this is a fantasy world, so why not make the hero gorgeous, smart, and rich? Not to mention delightfully grumpy and mysterious. EBYT is not as good as Paradise and Perfect, but it is very enjoyable and well written. My advice is that if you are looking for a good contemporary McNaught, buy Paradise (the best), then Perfect (almost as good), then pick up EBYT. You'll enjoy it more in that order. Judith McNaught has a way of drawing you into her world and keeping you there, so you are still thinking about the book and the characters for days, even weeks after you have finished reading!"
1,Good gosh what happened....,"First off let me say Judith McNaught is a brilliant writer and is one of my favorite authors...with that said let me go on to the reason I gave this book 1 Star. ""Every Breath You Take"" began awesome and I thought ""Oh yeah, this is going to be a good one""...boy was I wrong! In my opinion this book was a disaster, the things wrong with the story and how it was written is so great I don't want to spend my time writing about them. What I will tell you is Do Not judge this wonderful author based on this novel. If you have never read one of McNaught's books please don't start with this one, instead try ""Kingdom of Dreams"" or ""Paradise""."
3,Getting Lazy?,I LOVE Judith McNaught BUT it seemed like she was getting lazy with this book. She could have done so much more with the characters and obstacles they have to over come in order to be with each other. It just tied up too neatly in the last 15 pages-why did we miss a whole 22 months of their lives? I really liked both of the main characters but really felt cheated. I will probably always buy Ms.McNaught's books because I want to think that I will read another one of her works that I love as much as PARADISE.
4,Better than her other contemporary novels,"I'm a big fan of McNaught's historical novels while at the same time I detest all of her contemporary novels. Except this one. I truly enjoyed this one, much to my surprise. In the past I struggled to finish novels like ""Paradise"". The novel featuring Zack and Julie I never finished. But this book had tones of ""Once and Always"" and ""Whitney, My Love"". I couldn't set this one down. I snuck it into work with me and finished it in my office. If she can't give us another great historical novel, I can take another novel like this anytime."
3,It's a swizz - money making hype,"I live in the UK and pre-ordered the book, only to find Amazon USA has the ""Special Edition"", released on the same day ! ! ! Now we're told it's worth buying - as well as the ""Normal"" edition. I've e-mailed the publisher with my thoughts.The ordinary hardback/paperback edition was a disappointment and obviously the author realised her fans disappointment and did some additional work on the story, just a pity that 2 editions were published without notifying the buyers !!!!!!"
4,An Excellent Read!,"No one writes Romance like Judith McNaught. This book was a fantastic read. My only complain is that it was too short. Too short. Other than that, I couldn't get enough of the book."
4,"Rushed last third, but Still a Keeper","I just finished this book in a single sitting. I don't know of any other author who can capture me by just the actual ""falling in love"" moments the way JM can.Normally I stick to authors who pretty much ignore/are unable to write this way, and make up for it with a combination of action, secondary story lines and heat (of course). Many times the reader is left with the feeling that attraction between characters just magically morphed into love while you were turning a page and didn't notice. With a JM book, you see the falling in love happen as it unfolds effortlessly.This ability to engage the reader with just this truly makes her stand out as a great writer, her books stand out from the usual romance fare, makes readers fall in love with her characters ... and her books be an automatic buy for me. Other than the rush ending (yes, gotta concur a bit there), mostly bravo!"
3,Not her best work..,"This book is definitely not JM's best work. It started out fabulously and then seemed to get a bit lost. Once I was finished, it reminded me of a cheap knock off of Paradise."
2,A Big Mistake,"I am a Judith McNaught fan. I waited patiently for Every Breath you Take. So much so, that I remember when the title was going to be Water's Edge. Try as I might, I just couldn't get into the main characters, whose names I cannot even remember. Once they left the island, the book went downhill. It was choppy and lacked energy. There were too few love scenes and many questions left unanswered. It was even anticlimatic when the two reunited. After reading Perfect and Paradise, Every Breath You Take is definitely a disappointment. I plan to give the book away to my public library. Judith, if you are reading these customer comments, you owe us another book where you have plenty of time to write it and develop the characters. Also, I agree with one of the reviewers about diversity. Judith, the world does indeed have black and brown people. I recommend that you at least acknowledge this in your next novel since none of your published books do."
4,"Good Story, but Nothing New","I thought this was an enjoyable story. It was an easy read and the characters were very likeable and had good chemistry. However, it is very reminicent of ""Paradise"", following almost the exact same storyline. I loved ""Paradise"", reading it for the 3rd time just before reading this one. But reading this I had the feeling that I was reading a copy-cat of ""Paradise"". I did feel like the story wrapped up a little too quickly, like the ending was written hastily. I don't think that it is classic, brilliant McNaught, but I enjoyed it anyway and do recommend it! I am looking forward to Holly Braxton's story, ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" and hope that McNaught lets us know how Kate and Mitchell are doing!"
5,Every Breath You Take,"Thank You so much for such a wonderful gift, 'Every Breath You Take' that really take our breath away while reading this book. JM is coming back, with her wonderful talent she wrote another breath taking books that can't compare with others. Thou a bit shorter then her previous books, but this one still something you couldnt miss, especially with the appearance of our other heros, Matt &Zack. I hope she can write more and more in the future, at least once a year or maybe twice?? Well we know such the best quality book can't be written easily, but please think of your dying readers. Anyway this is one of the best books from JM that you couldn't miss. Bravo JM!!"
3,Disappointing,"I have all Judith McNaught books, making sure I have all handy anytime I feel like reading them again. While this book is not terrible, but having read her other books, this suffers a lot in comparison. I never really sympathized with the lead characters, the secondary characters were used and discarded with no resolution, the story developed slowly. In the middle part, I got a bit excited but then things never really panned out. There was a supposed mystery about the heroine's father's death, which the state attorney somehow connected to the hero but except for using it as one more piece of circumstancial evidence (a weak one, at that), nothing more about it is mentioned. This could have been a great book, but feels like it took so many wrong turns. The part I enjoyed more was the references to the characters from previous books."
1,Embarrassingly Bad,"Listening to the book on audio made me realize that I had been skipping past the bad dialogue and oddly un-erotic sex scenes found in Judith McNaughts last several books. I've been reading McNaught ever since she first came over 20 years ago, and have been one of her most ardent fans, but this book is bad. The love scenes are clichéd, the main characters wooden, and the plot tired."
1,Couldn't even finish it!,"I absolutely loved Judith McNaught's earlier books such as ""Paradise"" and ""Perfect."" This book was a terrible disappointment. The first half of the book leads up to a ""romantic encounter"" between the two main characters. I thought it started out okay with their encounter with the stray dog, ""Max."" From there it went down hill - fast! I finally looked at the last page, deciding not to waste any more time on this trivial book - it's going on my bookshelf, but I won't be passing it on to my friends!"
3,"All in all, great book read it - just don't invest in it.","I read this book quite a while ago and enjoyed it immensely. However, this time - not so much. It was really slow. The romance was sweet but again I was three quarters of the way through the book before I was interested enough to stop putting it down and walking away. I actually chose socializing at soccer instead of burring myself in my book. I'm not saying it's a bad book - it's got a great plot (sometimes it seems like a lot of different stories smooshed together), the character development is the best (well, for Kate, her boyfriend, and Mitchell you know all about them how they think and why), the scenes are terrific (you really feel as if you're actually there)."
1,Couldn't read more than 170 pages,"I really do try to give all books a chance and I hardly ever quit, but this just got ridiculous. I kept waiting for the story to unfold, but I had to go through 170 pages of LUST and I still hadn't gotten to the story. I'm all for lust, but 170 pages nonstop? Please. It gets old after awhile. I hope the book had a happy ending because I doubt seriously that I will ever find out. This book is being given to GoodWill. I doubt that I will ever buy another book by the author. Dumb!"
1,Not good at all,"I'm mystified that any romance fan could read this book and honestly believe it compares it to Ms. McNaught's better books and characters. Judith McNaught is a good writer, and has written some excellent books, but this is not one of them. Every Breath You Take is poorly, poorly done.While the beginning is okay, the ending is rushed and imcomplete. After reading it, I wondered if Ms. McNaught took a vacation in Anguilla and needed to get this book published by the end of '05 in order to write off the vacation on her taxes.Also, like some of the other reviewers here, I have to question the high starred reviews written. Either family and friends are padding the rankings or the publisher and publicist are doing it, because I don't believe people who have to consider where to invest their book money would advise other readers to buy this book.If you must read this book (as I felt I had to) make sure you borrow it, because at least then you'll only regret the time you spent on it."
3,Just Okay,"I have loved Ms. McNaught's previous books, but this one left something to be desired in the plot. It was a very predictable story and while the characters were somewhat interesting, I didn't care that much about them. The book is too much like many other romances I have read and I was a little bored with it. I'm glad I got from the library and didn't buy it."
2,Don't hold your breath...,"The book description starts with; ""Unforgettable characters, sizzling romance, and riveting suspense: These are the trademarks of beloved author Judith McNaught."" Read the reviews, not the product description before buying this one.I didn't find this book full of sizzling romance or riveting suspense. The book was very flat. The characters forgettable.Don't hold your breath in hopes that this is gonna be a good book. Judith McNaught is an excellent writer who usually does write unforgettable characters, sizzling romance, and riveting suspense, she just missed on this one."
1,every breath you take,pales in comparison to earlier works by the same author. lacks edge and ends abruptly
4,I really enjoyed this Book,"This was a very enjoyable book. It was not Ms. McNaught's best but it is a definite page turner. The characters were interesting and I liked the ending. There could have been a little more love making but this was an old fashined romance novel. I gave the book four stars instead of five because the ending was rushed. However, I enjoyed Mitchell's gorgeous steeliness and sexiness and I enjoyed Kate's subtle strenghth and sweetness. I would have liked to see their family interactions a little more. But, Hey Mr. McNaught bought back Matt and Meredith and Zack and Julie. It still could have used a little more making of the love. Also, the villain was straight out of today's headlines which was sad for us but true. (Oh yeah, can we get some Blacks in a books Ms. McNaught). Enjoyable read."
2,Not one of her best,"Ms. McNaught is a fantastic fictional novelist. It is hard to find any other writer in this genre who has created so many memorable stories and characters. I can read her books over and over and never grow tired of the material. But, this book is lacking her ""magical touch"". It is not her best work. It has more filler than story line and will not end up on my bookshelves. If you love her work and must read this book than get it at the library. Some of her best titles includethe following:Paradise,Double Standard, Until You, Once and Always, Something Wonderful, Kindom of Dreams and Night Whispers. Read these first and you won't be disappointed."
2,A Pale Shadow of Earlier Works,"I'm a huge McNaught fan (Perfect, Paradise and Whitney My Love being my favorites, in that order), but her last couple of books lack the spark of earlier works. The protagonists are not as clearly defined, or appealing, as those of earlier books. More importantly, the misunderstanding upon which the plot turns (and separates the lovers for nearly two years)is so flimsy that the reader is left thinking that both of them are morons. He said meet him at the boat. Why didn't you just go to the boat? I would ask our heroine. This book is for diehard McNaught fans only, and even they will be disappointed."
2,not a mystery,"This is a story about the 2 most beautiful people in the world, and one is also one of the richest! Wow- I can really relate to that-not. I thought this book involved a mstery or some intriguing story plot. It did not. It was all about the leading characters feelings of lust. Some great sex, some good misunderstandings, and a stupid kidnap thrown in to happily reunite the beautiful couple. This book should be listed under romance- any other story line is totally incidental."
2,"Dull, Predictable & Boring!","This book can be best described as ""okay"". I, personally, was not impressed. Although I finished the book I found it predictable and dull. This is the second book by Judith McNaught I have read, the first one being ""Paradise"" which I enjoyed. I felt that ""Every Breath You Take"" was written in the same format as ""Paradise"". I can't believe this Best Selling author had no imagination or originality in this book. If you are a die hard fan you might enjoy this. If you are not, you might want to save your money and pick something else."
2,Disappointing story,I am the fan of Judith Macnaught and read each of her creation. But I think this is the worst book of her novels.
1,"Similar story line, 250 years later","This book reads like one of Ms Naught's old work: Almost Heaven, in the 21st century. The plot might have worked in the 18th century, not doesn't work quite well for the 21st century. The characters in this modern version are not very well developed. Almost as if a few chapters of the book were missing. For example, Ms McNaught took the trouble to paint a detailed picture of Aunt Olivia in the opening, but Olivia disappears and doesn't make a reappearance until the end of the book. What happended in between that endeared Olivia to the jaded leading man? It is also quite improbable for a worldly man to fall head over heels over a woman he just met without knowing anything about her. The readers cannot be convinced that a character in the book is intelligent just because the author kept stating he is; the author has to demonstrate it either through deed or through conversations. I found none in this book. A great disappointment."
4,JM is still a wonderful writer,"I looked forward to this books for years and I was not disappointed! I loved the characters and their dialogue. Kate and Mitchell were both witty and funny. I loved reading every scene that was set in Anguilla. I thought the secondary characters were amazing (they always are in JM's books).My only complaint is that the book is too short, but I say that about every book she has ever written.I can't wait to read the next Judith McNaught book. Especially with Holly as the heroine!"
3,Not bad but not great,"First, let me just say I LOVE Judith McNaught! She is the one who really opened my eyes to the romance genre and to this date I have not found another author who can capture a love story the way she does. My favorites of hers are Something Wonderful, Kingdom of Dreams and Paradise.That said, I've been disappointed by some of her books before (you can tell when it had to go to print quick) and have taken in all the warnings about her romantic suspense. I haven't even tried to read any of those because I'm not trying to set myself up for disappointment. But still I was really excited when this book was released.It's not horrible. I enjoyed it because I haven't read a new McNaught in years. But it just doesn't have all that magic her earlier novels have. You know the magic that makes you want to spend every waking minute with the book until you've finished the last page. No, this book didn't have that for me. I'd say it only had half of it."
2,Not her best work,"I absolutely love Paradise, Night Whispers and Someone to Watch Over Me, and was hoping for more of the same. Unfortunately this wasn't it. The island section dragged on, and the rest was quite predictable. Kate's character was pretty one-dimensional, and though Mitchell was billed as having many ""layers"" they were not apparent by his actions. It seemed like bits and pieces from the above mentioned novels were patchworked together. Wait for the paperback, or even better the library copy. I wish I would've."
1,Not your typical McNaught,"I love Judith Mcnaught's work. Her historicals are stellar one-of-kind novels that pull at your heart strings. In my opinion all of her historicals are winners. SOME of her contemporary works are fabulous as well - Perfect and Paradise to name a few. There are other contemporary flops though (Remember When, Triumphant Heart, etc). Every Breath You Take was such a disappointment. The plot, character development, and writing was not up to par. I found it very hard to believe that a couple could fall in love in 2 days, be separated for two years and then fall back in love instantly upon meeting again. It was really forced.Someone mentioned it was ""amatuerish"" and I have to agree. I think anyone could have written this novel. I understand that the book was rushed, and to tell you the truth it reads like a novel that was written in a mad dash.I love Judith but this book was just terrible."
1,Would not recommend,"I agree with the other reviewers that this book was a huge disappointment. The only emotion I felt after finishing it was anger. I can't even put it in the category of one of Judith McNaught's ""weaker"" books. Those books were enjoyable, if not memorable. I thought EBYT was poorly written and poorly crafted, and I feel stupid for getting it. Book money is hard for me to come by -- I won't make the mistake of buying JM again."
5,Execelllent,I love all her books and I would be hard put to say which is my favorite. I have read most of them more than once.
5,Fantastic read!,A romantic classic that will have you rooting for both Kate and Mitchell throughout the story! McNaught is my favorite author of all time.
1,Worst McNaught Yet!,"I can't believe the 4+star reviews, (I think author friends or family are writing for Judith) This is the worst book she has ever written. In the story Mitchell is an intelligent multimillionaire but behaves like a 2 year old.I can't believe that an intelligent man would behave so stupidly, if he really cared for Katherine he would have been following her life.(therefore no surprises!) I never felt Mitchell was in love with Katherine.This is the same story as her last few books with the names changed."
2,Mediocre,"My sister in law is a huge Judith McNaught fan and started me reading her books. I have read just about all of them now and have enjoyed each one. However, I thought this was terrible and not up to McNaught's usual great writing. I thought this book was very similar to her last book - super rich guy suspected of murder. The suspense was not much and the misunderstanding that pulls the two main characters apart is so contrived that it feels fake! The two main characters supposedly fall in love after 3 days together on vacation and then when reunited 30 months later are still in love - this is so unrealistic. I still finished it and it was a quick read but I was really disappointed."
1,Yawn!,"Really, I can't believe all the 4 star ratings. This book is boring. No character development whastsoever. I LOVE JM but she can do much better than this. I have read and re-read all her previous books but this one I had to force myself to finish."
2,Really?,Come on- this? Again with the self-made bajillionaire tycoon hero/movie star/british lord who's been wronged by his family and wrongly judged by society? But she's done this story! A lot! I liked this story and these (yes decidedly flat) characters better when she wrote them in other books. She should have just left well-enough alone.
1,Same old boring plot,Judith McNaught needs to go back and write Historicals. Her recent books haven't been as entertaining as her previous stories. I couldn't even finish reading this book! It is very rare for me to not finish a book no matter how bad it is! The plot is the same as the previous few books before it! The story started out good but it went downhill quickly toward the middle of the book. I've read and finished all her other books beside this one. I am skeptical about her future releases and will only read them if I have nothing else to read.
3,Not So Good,"I really expected better from Judith Mcnaught. Her books should continue to get better as she writes,not worse. I would rather wait longer for her to come out with a new book then to read something of hers that is half-baked and thrown together. I started reading her about 14 years ago. Perhaps because I am now 35, I have outgrown her. Yet I really don't think that this is the case. I think this book just stunk. It wasn't so bad that I didn't finish it, but I did a lot of skimming and didn't miss much."
2,Dissapointed,"This is my first book review and I decided to do it because I was so dissapointed by this book. I love Judith Mcnaught books and have almost all of them. I read Paradise and Perfect many times over and was looking forward to this one too. However, this book was lacking all the details and plot development that the other books had. I agree with the other reviews that this book had too many loose ends and unanswered questions. It had great potential for a wonderful book - the cherachters, the mystery, the setting and the story. I wish it was written better."
3,I don't know what to think,"I love Judith Mc Naught -- Absolutely love her writing. But Every Breath You Take (EBYT) leaves me unsure what to think... Is this a mediocre mid-career filler novel? Or the beginning of the end for her illustrious career? I agree with several other reviewers that while I was reading EBYT I frequently felt like I was experiencing Paradise or Double Standards or maybe even Perfect deja vu. Although I would read a menu if JMN wrote it, this novel, despite its familiar well written characters, seems to be floundering for a plot. Pieces of past novels have been cobbled together in an unsatisfying and incomplete storyline for two characters, Mitchell and Kate, that deserve so much more. Pick this book up if you haven't read JMN's other novels. If you have, expect to feel like you've read this novel before."
3,Missing the magic,"I have read everyone of the author's book and this one struck me as being written to a script. All of the author's modern romances follow the same pattern: boy meets girl, they fall in love, one partner thinks the worst of the other and does something to sabotage relationship, years later the two reunite and are still in love. While very formulaic, the book is an enjoyable piece of fluff."
2,100 pages of fluff then it gets good...kinda,"I usually really love her books and this one was good but not great.I think if the first 150 pages of ""will she wont she"" were not so repetitive it would be much more enjoyable. The characters of Kate and Mitchell were likeable and the story did get better as it went along.It was just way too fluffy for me and not a suspense at all.I also find the lifestyle of her characters so insanly unreal. Private jets, nannies,access to five million dollars in 2 hours, Money beyond imagination. Just too fluffy......."
1,Not Pleased,"I was completely disappointed in this book. I love Judith McNaught but this book was not well-written. I read her acknowledgements in the beginning and what I came away with that she had to hurry up and write this book. The last 80 pages of the just lost my interest and I could feel McNaught lost the story and had to hurry up and finish the book. I would like to see this book recalled and focused more on a well thought out ending before returning to the shelves instead of a ""rushed, hurry up and get it published"" type of approach.Judith McNaught's best book by far is ""Perfect"" with ""Paradise"" following up with a close 2nd place."
3,Wish more Mcnaught books were on tape,"I thoroughly enjoyed the book but know and love the characters 's McNaught has brought from Perfect & paradise into this story,,,it's a stand alone book but the other two are better"
4,Stay with it.,"I have to admit that about half way through this book I went to the end. I do that sometimes when I know something bad is going to happen. I start reading it backwards. The last chapter is what kept me going to finish it BUT there are so many holes in this story you could drain noodles in it. What was the deal with Kate's father? Big mystery was implied but no answer. How did she make the resturant a success? No answer. Also, nothing that bad ever happens. It just had too many story lines that went unanswered. If Ms. McNaught is going to answere them in another book she should at least give us a clue."
2,Just doesnt touch my heart...,"I used to read and re-read and re-read again and again Ms. Mcnaught books until they're fall apart and I still keep them....She was my number one author, hell,..she still is...it just, this last book didnt moved me the way they usually do...But I have an optismistic hope that Ms. Mcnaught still have the extraordinary tallents to create another master piece in the future, just not in this book...."
3,Disappointed,"I am giving this story three stars because although I expected more, it was still not a complete waste of time.The biggest problem I have is that Judith McNaught keeps recycling the same formula, and in some cases even the same dialogue, over and over. In particular, there is always a scene in all of her books where the heroine relates a story from her childhood to her hero and he becomes protective of her. It is rehashed so many times that I am quite sick of it. When I could see it coming in this book I practically rolled my eyes and sighed, ""Here we go again...""I used to love JM, but her plotlines have become so predictable that I'm not even sure I will continue to read her books anymore."
2,Waste of time,"The plot is anywhere from contrived to ludicrous. The characters are boring and trite. Don't waste your time. I quit reading at about chapter 7. At that time, I was sure it wasn't going to get any better as it was sliding rapidly into worse."
2,Been There Done That,"Industrial fiction meets holocaust fiction and the survivor myth. The writing is good but the characters, plotting, and ideas are stale. If you perfer form to content this is a book for you. But if you like form and content to work equally well in a book then this one falls flat."
2,ultimately disappointing,"the book is a surreal mixture of different themes: noir mystery, love story, linguistic philosophy and even the holocaust -- sort of raymond chandler meets wittgenstein.jack o'connell writes really well, but the big problem with this novel is that none of the characters are real. by ""real"" i mean capable of evoking emotional resonance. so in spite of the fact that many of the passages are very stylish and intriguing, at the end of the book i was left feeling cheated, because i didn't care who lived or died, and in particular what happened to gilrein, the book's protagonist.give me iain m. banks any day."
3,Do you like detective novels?,"I find this book interesting, but I do not know if I would buy anything else from this author. I was expecting more sci-fi and less of a detective novel. It is a detective novel wrapped inside of a descriptively written suspenseful thriller. If you like detective novels that are a bit on the dark side...buy this book. If you like sci-fi or horror and were hoping for a darker Blade Runner, don't buy it.The book took a long time to grab me. Around page 190 it started to pick up and become interesting. Remember that I do not like detective novels. If you do like that genre, you would be captivated after the first few pages."
2,old fashioned,The purchased book could be in principle a good tool.But in my opinion the information is quite old.
4,Great Product,I just received this set of cookware and found it to be one of the best I have ever used. I will keep them forever.
1,Actually 0 stars -- pass this one up!,"After a while you'll never get those ""rugged concentric grooves"" clean and you will be grossed out by your own cookwear. I'd never recommend Circulon cookware because of this, especially since there are so many high-quality, smooth-bottomed pans on the market."
1,Not good.....,It was hard to get thru this book! Grace was a cold hearted woman - Kilmer was too wishy washy for a CIA agent....Frankie was a know-it all child of 8 going on 35. A composer???? Don't waste your time!!!!
2,Review by Nan Kilar and Bob Miller,"Grace Archer and her precocious eight-year-old daughter, Frankie, live on a horse farm in Alabama trying to have a normal life. Robert is her government protector and local martial arts instructor. Out of nowhere, the bad guys find out where she is and her former mentor, Jake Kilmer, shows up to protect her and her daughter. He and his team move Grace, Frankie and Robert to a remote ranch in Wyoming. Thanks to a leak from someone in government, they're found again, and Frankie is kidnapped.Marvot, the head bad guy, entices Grace to Morocco since he has her daughter and because he wants her to tame his two almost-wild horses for a sinister reason. Of course Kilmer and his gang try to get them out in one piece.The story has a few surprises that could easily be anticipated. And if the premise for this book seems familiar, it is - the story is very much like Ridley Pearson's Cut and Run."
2,but got (a) flat,"Have enjoyed previous works by Ms. J due to the pace and likability of characters. Yes-this one moves along pretty well, too, but noted a time refence flaw pretty quickly (from 8 yrs ago to 9 years ago). Did NOT see that these characters were developed nearly as well as those in past works. The kid is great at music and really good with horses and karate(with very few, if any, examples to support this). Mom is a former member of an elite team,with the love interest being the team leader. Again, very little to no support of how much butt she can kick or of how sharp this guy is as a leader. f-l-a-t"
4,"Fast-paced action, exhilarating suspense",Grace Archer has been in hiding with her daughter Frankie on a horse farm in Alabama for the last eight years. The CIA has paid for her protection but not any longer. Her cover is blown and thus mother and child are forced to go on the run. Grace reluctantly lets Jake Kilmer back into her life. They had powerful chemistry together eight years ago. Grace ferociously fights to protect her daughter. The evil Marvot lures Grace back to El.Tariq to help tame his pair of horses to facilitate the discovery of a long-lost treasure. The main characters are interesting and connect well with one another. Some secondary characters are not as well construed. Overall it was an exciting adventure with a touch of romance.
2,Stiffen up!,"I've read every single Iris Johansen book, and this is definitely the worst! To me it was something like you'd expect from a Harlequin Romance novel. And how many times does she have to use the word ""stiffen""? Someone was always stiffening, about to stiffen or had already stiffened! I know Ms Johansen can write - I guess we'll have to wait until the next book."
2,Not what I was expecting,"This was the first Johansen book I have read and it was a total disappointment. After reading all the glowing reviews, I was expecting a fast paced thriller. Instead I got a weak plot and a love story filled with cheesy dialect. There were interesting parts to the book, but overall it was just another lame story churned out by an over-producing author."
1,a boring read,this book was boring because about half the book kept saying the same thing over and over again (do I tell my daughter that he's her father or not). boring.
2,Meh....,"This is the first book I've read by this author, and I thought it was horrible. The characters are incredibly unrealistic. Frankie is the most annoying of them all, second is Grace. I couldn't relate at all, it took forever to finish because I couldn't stand reading it, and it was just plain uninteresting. I'll probably read another book just to see if this book is not like her usual work. I'm now reading a Dean Koontz book (one of my favorite authors), and it's so refreshing to read an author who at least has some characters that are relatable in some way."
3,Ehh,"I just finished reading ""On The Run"" by Iris Johansen. It wasn't bad. I found the story light. As for the writing it was fine. Not too deep with the characters. There was action, some humor, a bit of sex. Parts that really made me smile. Just a good holiday read. I would have to try reading some other books by the auther. This didn't sell me on the best book ever made."
2,Was hoping third time would be a charm...,"After being disappointed by 'Countdown' and 'Killer Dreams', I was ready to give Ms. Johansen ONE MORE try. After all, third time is the charm, right? At least, hopefully.This story started out decently enough, but it quickly degenerates into another sketchy, lackluster storyline. I found the Pair to be more interesting than any of the human characters within the book (or the other two books I read) The premise was just hard to swallow, especially since the explanations were not well-done. After this, I won't be reading any more books by this author."
3,Good then bad,"I liked the first half of this book, it was like reading an action adventure. The first couple of chapters started out really strong. But the plot did not hold my interest and I had to skip most of the 2nd half of the book. You knew from the beginning how the romance would end. I got bored with all the pages about the great horses, if you're not a horse lover, you'll be bored also."
3,Lose the uptight heroine,"This was my first Iris Johansen book and there were many aspects of it I liked. I enjoyed the fast-pace and larger-than-life characters, especially the horse-whisperer scenes. What dragged it down for me was Grace's treatment of Jake. She felt betrayed by him 9 years ago but even after learning that she was wrong, she continues to treat him like dirt. She never appreciates the sacrifice Jake made in staying out of her and their daughter's life. Instead she uses him (for sex and protection of her daughter)and gives little in return.More romance (not to be equated with sex) between Grace and Jake would have raised this to a 5-star for me."
1,I tried to read it so many times....,"I attempted to read this book multiple times and simply could not do it. I tried from the beginning a few times. Then I thought, we'll maybe it's just a slow beginning. I attempted to read a few chapters in and still found myself incredibly bored. I checked to see if it was a sequel because I felt SURE that I was missing something that would make the plot make sense. Photos of blue eyed horses in the passenger seat of a car, the CIA watching a woman on a ranch with a precocious and ""special"" child who doesn't know who her father is. Horses who ""know"" things... It was clique and boring - boring - boring. I simply could NOT get into it after attempting for two years. I have now given up and am about to donate it so that another poor soul can waste their time attempting to read it."
2,Very Disappointing,"I'm a long time fan of Iris Johansen's books, but I found On The Run very disappointing. The character and relationship development was weak when compared to her many other excellent books. The plot had potential, but tended to drag on. It didn't help that I found obvious holes in the plot.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone knowledgeable about horses. There were glaring errors in details specific to horses that I found very distracting. I usually find horse-related errors in fiction, but some of these errors were fundamental to the plot so key story elements became too unrealistic for the plot to be successful for me ... even as fiction.With better research and attention to detail regarding the horses, the plot that focused so much on horses could have been adjusted to work well. Non-horsemen wouldn't be aware of the errors and perhaps they would enjoy this book. Many other Johansen books have been keepers for me to re-read, but not this book."
1,Dreadful book,"I am constantly amazed at what can get published. The plot of this book requires the reader to suspend any sense of logic and rationality. In fact, the plot is so far-fetched I thought it was a parody. The characters are not believable at all. The reader is supposed to believe that Mozart has been re-incarnated as Frankie. Um right. And I am the queen of Spain. This is the first book by the author that I have read and I am not anxious to pick up another one. I found the plot lines and character developments to be insultingly stupid. Almost too embarassed to donate this book. I pray for the trees sacrificed to make this."
1,Not my cup of tea,"I got about 40% through it, but couldn't make myself finish this one, since I just couldn't care about the protagonist. Grace Archer is a control freak. That causes her to make foolish decisions. She has trouble accepting help when she's in over her head. If she were family, you'd stick by her. If she's only a character in a book, you might just close the book and say, ""Enough!""I did."
3,Not Her Best,"Grace Arhcer and her young daughter Frankie live and work on a horse farm. Their lives are shattered when someone is sent to kill them. Grace use to be a secret agent, she went into hiding from an evil man named Marlvo. Enter in Frankie's father (Jake) a strong silent type. He offers to protect Grace and Frankie. Marlvo needs Grace to tame two white horses he has for reasons unknown to Grace. Grace and Jake have a hard time denying their still existing passion.Basically this novel is full of ridiculous scenes, terrible dialogue and unrealistic plot line. I am not even sure why I gave it three stars. But I like Johansen and I like her fast paced novels. They are easy reads. Here in this novel I just didn't buy Grace and Jake's love. I was also annoyed by how precoious Frankie is. It was just too unrealistic."
3,Not her best work,I usually like this author very much but this book referred to the past between the two main character so much you almost felt like she shoulda wrote a book about that first..it's a great story but reading it you feel like you have missed a book before...I wanna know what actually happen 8 years ago not bits a pieces!
4,Never stops but has holes in it,"I'm not going to ruin this for anyone - so don't worry about a spoiler. This story took off with a bang and didn't quit until the last page. I thoroughly enjoyed it, but was left wondering about several plotlines that were introduced but never tied off. Since this was a complete change from the Eve Duncan stories, there's no way of knowing if there will be explanations in a later story. Still, a real page-turner!"
1,Ick.,"Are you KIDDING?That was my thought after completing this novel. Horribly cliched with second-grader knowledge of horses, a plot too silly to comprehend, a child that simply gets dragged to one ranch after another and apparently (other than music and horses) receives no education, and a couple of horses who know how to get to (for the love of Pete!) an engine in the desert. Throw in sex, guns, an untouchable evil person and a woman who is the only person in the WORLD who can tame the wild Pair. I guess you call it a book. YIKES.Masochistic streak. Yup, that's why I finished it."
5,very good,It's amazing that a Brazilian group can handle so many different styles from all over the world. The Mawaca singers are fantastic and the arrangements are stunning. Check it out their websitewww.mawaca.com.br
5,The checklist was invaluable.,"For the company that employs me, I wrote a Y2K Plan. This plan includes our company's Y2K Test Plan and its Y2K Contingency Plan. I picked up Don Sabatini's book because I was interested in other people's opinions and plans for Y2K.Don Sabatini's book impressed me. I found the book easy to read and I particularly liked its comprehensive checklist. I would recommend buying this book just for the checklist."
4,Very readable book on issues to consider regarding Y2K!,"Enjoyed reading something short and to the point on the issues that I need to consider regarding the turning of the century. I will definately take action on things as simple as having cash around the house, water, etc so that if something does go wrong - it won't effect me and my family!"
1,The only thing to fear is the book itself!,"The information contained in this book is hardly objective. The author guides the reader down a road of outlandish preparedness tactics. This book is advises the reader to use non-fiction methods to address fictional situations.If you buy this book and follow its advice, the world really will be in trouble."
3,Good for its purpose,"I had to use this book for a class. Some parts of it were helpful, but it was a little repetitive and some parts didn't seem to apply."
5,Perfect for using your broadband card at home...,"I purchased one of these from Amazon in order to be able to use my Sprint broadband internet card (Pantech) in my home computer. Installation was a snap and after installing the Sprint Software on my home system, the card came up just like it did on my laptop. (Just remember to load the software BEFORE you insert the card.) If you are looking for a inexpensive way to get a bit more use from your broadband internet card, you should definitely try one of these!"
2,Incompatible with Windows 7 or Vista,"I got one of these at work. It uses a ""Richo RL5C475(II) CardBus Controller"" for which there are no Windows 7 or Vista drivers."
4,Decent product for the money,"Worked as expected, and great way to utilize those left over, but useful, CardBus cards in your older desktop computers."
3,Works Good,"Works good, needed no drivers, my system recognized it at once. Only draw back was the card slides in upside down so the antennae points down."
2,PCI - Adapter Card,"I recieved the product in good condition, it did install with ease on windows xp, no driver problems, but by the third day the item was creating an error and my system was rebooting every two hours."
3,"It works, but...","It works, and did not require a driver load on Windows XP SP-2. However, it seems to have trouble seeing my Pantech PX-500 air card. It occasionally will simply refuse to recognize that there is even a card present. When it does see the card, it is trouble free for that session. I have not ruled out the possibility that I'm simply doing something wrong."
3,worked eventually,when i first installed it. Did not work. It failed to acquire a device driver. However 2 months later it started working.
4,A fine return for one of England's premier folk/rock bands.,"1985's ""Gladys' Leap"" was a fine and unexpected return to form for one of England's premier folk/rock bands. The more conservative fans will still yearn for the Denny/Thompson good old days: don't listen to them! Simon Nicol is an impeccable front man and the instrumental backing is nothing short of marvelous. Virtuosity and good humor abound on this album. The all-instrumental ""Expletive Delighted"" continues the trend, and although one misses Nicol's vocals, the stunning versions of ""Sidh Beg Sidh Mor"" and ""Hanks for the Memory"" (with Richard Thompson and Jerry Donahue guesting for a jaw-dropping guitar duel) make this record more than worth the price of admission."
2,for the coffeetable not for reading,"I was so disapointed with this book when I got it. I wanted some ANALYSIS and scholarship in conjunction with the photographs...but NO, there was NONE TO BE FOUND. The reproductions are nice and if you just want something to look at fine...get the book. However, if you actually want to read a book about french studios this is not the book to buy."
4,Eyecatcher,"This watch turns heads - men who collect watches, women with a sense of style, even curious children want a closer look. The triangular design is so unique, bold, and simply cool. While the case is a massive block of steel, it looks well-balanced on many wrist sizes. The maori markings of the face are intriguing, and repeated on the rubber band. The band is easily sized to various wrist sizes, but requires a little attention to keep clean. I've found that a cotton swab wetted with Armor All gives the band a great shine. This is a very fun watch to own!"
4,"Slow-Starter, but develops into a fascinating masterpiece","Beautiful! Ms. Buck truly speaks of all classes of China. Because of her situation, a white woman who lived in China among Chinese, she has a special viewpoint into Chinese culture. Main character Wang Lung experiences many loops in his life. It is interesting to see why these repetitions take place! This is a great book, but not for someone who lacks patience. Once this book gets going, you will be engrossed!"
3,A bit dated,A good history book but rather dated in style and content... I enjoyed this book when I was a teenager better than now.
3,A good book,"This book was recommend it from a good friend of mine. I liked the ending better than the beginning. But I would recommend this to others. It's not a turn pager but it did give me something good to read. I enjoyed it. Will I recommend this to others, yeah if they don't have any other choice."
5,The Good Earth,"I had never read ""The Good Earth"" and always meant to, but it is easy to get these classics on my kindle so I got it."
4,An Excellent Novel,"The Good Earth by Pearl S. Buck is definitely on my list of favorite books. The Good Earth takes you along the ups and downs of the life of a poor farmer, Wang Lung. It sounds kind of boring, but with the never ending ups and downs of his life it kept me interested until the very end. Of course, this was a superb novel, yet I was bothered by the treatment of women throughout the novel. I was also occasionally disgusted that Wang Lung, a very good man ends up with concubines. Of course this is old Chinese tradition and the matter can be easily excused. I was in love with this book, until the very last sentence. The last sentence is what makes this book a 4 instead of a 5. Of course, I won't ruin the ending for you, but after I read the last sentence, I was so unbeleivably disappointed. I'll just say the ending is depressing. Still, it's worth it to read it and until the last seconds it took me to read the last sentence, I enjoyed every minute of it."
5,The Epic Tale of Wang Lung,"I picked this book up over the summer, not having heard anything about it. From the very beginning, I was intrigued. It has poignant themes, vivid imagery, and an entertaining plot. Whether reading for pleasure or for critical analysis, you won't be disappointed. This is an amazing novel- don't let the simplicity fool you."
5,Transcends Space and Time!,"Every soul that has the ability to read should absorb this book! These are the lessons we all encounter at some point in our lives.Wang Lung and his family's journey through life serves as a passage we all can travel through and come away better people for having done it. His wife O-lan represented such great strength, and I hurt when I knew she was hurting from the actions of her husband but was unable to show it. Her life went the way of so many women's lives, unfulfilled and short-changed. Likewise, I hurt when Wang Lung hurt. I felt his confusion, guilt, stubbornness, etc. These are brilliantly crafted people that I am honored to have met.I totally understand why this book transcends space and time. Over 30 years after her death, Pearl S. Buck's legacy is still changing people for the better....thank God for good storytelling."
3,Getting a little dusty,"Reading this book I was quite impressed how well Pearl S. Buck does get into the, somewhat archaic and slightly barbaric, mind of a Chinese farmer around the beginning of the 20.th. century. So the book is actually a little piece of historic legacy. This book is the first of a trilogy ""The House of Earth"", I might try to have a look at some of the other books at some time."
5,One of my all-time favorites,"I have to say that this book is one of my favorites. The message, the story telling, the characters all meld together to make for a very satisfying read. In the end it makes you want to go out and be a better person. Thoroughly enjoyed it!"
5,Excellent,I would have to say this is one of the best books I've ever read. It draws you right away. The sequel to this book Sons is about a 3 1/2 star and I was disappointed by the third book A house divided. I would definately recommend the first book.
2,"A lengthy, dragging book with some interesting realizations.",I was forced to read this book for school and I found it to be quite a bore. The book seemed to go on forever and never end. I was simply happy when I passed the picture section of my book. Over all I did not enjoy reading this book and wonder how it can be a classic and yet so unenjoyable for many students. It was more a painstaking process to read than anything else. I can not recommend this book to read unless you wish to be very bored.
4,A Wonderful Story!,"I really loved this book! It's a great and easy read with great characters and a wonderful story. The thing I liked most was that the story really comes full circle: it starts when Wang Lung is a young man and is getting ready to be wed, and ends with him living out his last years with his sons and grandchildren and everything in between. I was also really moved by the struggle of this family as they are extremely poor when the novel starts, but with hard work and determination become a very wealthy family."
4,"The Good Earth, A Good Read","The Good Earth is an old classic; won the 1932 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Good Earth tells a story of Wang Lung, who is doing as his father did, his fathers' father did, and so on. As a farmer he had land, one working ox, and the sweat of his body. Wang Lung married a slave/servant from the house of Hwang. O-lan was a good wife bore 3 sons and 2 slaves (servants otherwise known as girls). O-lan cooked, clean, worked in the field, and made life easier for her husband. The family goes from a farmer to the poor in a city south of their homes during the drought to being the tenant in the old house of Hwang. The choices of Wang Lung's sons changed the next generation and the next.If you have an interest in Chinese culture-read this book. If you want to read about the life of a woman who lived with honor, O-lans story will please you-read this book. If you want to read a Pulitizer Prize book for fiction-read this book.This book is recommended."
4,Wonderful audio book,"This is a wonderful audio book of a terrific story. The other reviewers can give you some history about Pearl Buck as well as how authentic her descriptions of China are (I have never been to China, so I can't comment on this.)I very much enjoyed this book. If you are interested in a well-told story, I would highly recommend this book."
5,A true gem,"I recently picked this book up at The Island Shop at Nassau in the Bahamas. What a wonderful book. I have not enjoyed reading a book this much in some time. This simple but poignant story follows a man, Wang Lung, through his life from his perspective. It is a tale of a man and his relationship with the land. It paints a picture of the different life stages one passes through. It is about an intergenerational family and its complex dynamics. It is a ""rags to riches"" story that reinforces the benefits of hard work and sacrifice. It is about surviving hardship. It speaks to man's sexual cravings. It causes one to think about the most important qualities of a good spouse. And, it is a view into a specific culture (Chinese) and time (early 1900s). Finally, the book is a very easy read for people of almost any age. I highly recommend this book."
5,The Real China,"The Good Earth should be required reading in every American school. At a time when so many young people seem to believe the world owes them a living, the quiet and heroic efforts of a farming family from the early years of 20th Century China serve as a reminder of real courage and the value of work and frugality. In addition, the difficult lives of girls born into poor Chinese families provides stark illustrations on the tremendous freedoms and privileges enjoyed by Western girls throughout the last century and especially today.There is nothing sugar-coated in the images provided by Pearl Buck. The author gives names and faces to Chinese people and provided an honest, human view of life. Without question, this work by the author caused many Americans to come to the aid of China as it was assaulted by the immoral and inhuman forces of the Empire of Japan beginning in 1931. I recommend this haunting book to everyone with some sense of decency and historical reality."
3,Timeless themes,"This story proves that things are the same everywhere, in real life, in the pages of a romance novel, and here in ""the Good Earth"".And it is one of the great truths that money corrupts.Money is the root of all evil.And some men are still shallow lotharios.This was an absorbing tale which brought me into China. The attitudes toward females is shameful and ridiculous. I was disgusted by Wang Lung's foolhardy behavior with Lotus and treatment of O'Lan.This was a classic tale of money rotting men's souls."
3,oversimplified characters,"It's obvious that Buck thought there was little going on between there ears of Chinese farmers of the 19th century. I saw very little humanity. So little humanity that I found it impossible to ever regard Wang Lung highly in any way after he became decadent. The other characters were similarly flawed and showed me nothing that which I could relate. Only O-lan and Wang Lung's loyal neighbor turn out to be a sympathetic characters.I will still give it some stars. I did enjoy the familiar pattern of self-deception that Wang used to justify his own corruption. Who knows, maybe also I learned something about the culture or rural Chinese of the time.I'm not as cynical as Buck seems to have been; I would have preferred to see more sympathetic characters. Also a lot more psychological insights."
3,Vivid descriptions from a writer behind her time,"More than anything else, this book shows how vapid the Pulitzer Prize folks are. This is a good book in many ways: it carries you away like a good mystery, engulfs you in scenery, and keeps the story running. However, Buck didn't learn even the obvious lessons taught by Mark Twain et al. before her time about avoiding florid language and contrived dialog. It's a book with a purpose and probably (for I know no better) with a strong sense of the state of things in China during period in question, but it's also a frankly adolescent piece of writing."
3,Interesting novel,"The Good Earth, a novel, was very intersting to me. Although it was slow in some parts, it also had meaning to it. As it took place in the 19th century, I tried to visualize what it could have looked like. Throughout the book, I could find figurative language such as irony and symbolism. Irony would have been where Wang Lung saw the flock of crows fly overhead and knew it was an ""evil omen"". Symbolism took place when the people painted or wore red for new beginnings or great luck. This book is great to read whenever you would like to learn about old China."
3,it was okay,"TOM KNAUST A.THE NOVEL THE GOOD EARTH IS ABOUT A POOR MAN WHO PROSPERES OVER THE YEARS. HE WORKED ON HIS LAND AND MADE LOTS OF MONEY. HIS SONS WERE GREEDY AND WANTED EVERYTHING. WHEN HE BROUGHT ANOTHER WOMAN INTO HIS HOUSE HIS FATHER GOT VERY ANGRY AT HIM AND SCREAMED HARLOT INTO THE INNER COURTS OF WANG LUNGS HOUSE. O-LAN, HIS WIFE DIED AND HE WOKE UP TO THE WORLD AND REALIZED THAT HE LOVED THE LAND MORE THAN LOTUS, HIS CONCUBINE. I LIKED THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT SHOWS HOW PEOPLE LIVED IN ANCIENT CHINA. I REALLY LIKED HOW WANG LUNG PROSPERED OVER THE YEARS. HE WAS A HARD WORKING MAN AND DESERVED HIS GOOD FORTUNE. HE STARTED OUT A POOR FARMER, AND BECAME RICH OVER THE YEARS.I THINK THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO READ THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT CAN SHOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO SAVE YOUR MONEYAND WORK HARD. IT SHOWS THAT IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU SPEND YOUR MONEY YOU WILL MAKE LOTS OF MORE MONEY."
1,What's all the fuss about?,"I had never read The Good Earth before Oprah picked it as her current selection. Unfortunately, I had to read it in small doses as it just didn't capture my interest. It reads as though someone is narrating a story in a ""once upon a time"" fashion. The story is depressing. None of the characters have any depth except the main one, Wang Lung. The author's over-use of the phrases ""here and there"", ""this and that"", and ""hither and thither"" was annoying. I still like Oprah but not this book."
1,The Good Earth---I have not yet received the book!!!!,The only reason I rated this item one star is that people I ordered this from acknowledged my email stating that I have never received this book. I ordered in mid May and they said they were sending another book. I still have not received that book though I verified my mailing address. This has been charged to my account and I am afraid they will charge the next book to my account also. I am not happy with this dealer at all. I ordered all books on the same day and received them within a week except for The Good Earth.
1,This is an awful book,Way to go Oprah! I remember reading this atrocity back in high school and I have to say its acrid aftertaste has stayed with me for more than a decade. This is a horrible and boring book. First she recommends Leo Tolstoy (I'm sure his ghost is none too thrilled) and now this. Steer clear.
3,Engrossing tale told with archaic language,"All right. I know that this is going to sound juvenile, and trust me, I am over 13. I couldn't help being bogged down with the archaic language Buck used to tell this otherwise interesting story. I think that the appeal is the insight one gets into pre-Revolutionary China. I dare say many of the customs from the pages of this book still exist in some form. If you want a well told, detailed look into the fascinating culture of China, this book is for you. If you really need fast-paced, contemporary writing, I'd say maybe listen to this one from an Audio book. Sorry to the Buck disciples, but I'm just trying to give my honest impressions."
4,Another wonderful book.,"I absolutely love well written books, and this book was very well written. The character development was great and the story kept my interest. It touched many of my emotions. Another book I recommend is A Year Since Yesterday by a writer I was not previously familiar with, George Edward Zintel. It is also one of the very best books I have ever read. If you buy A Year Since Yesterday, it is listed as paperback but is actally a high quality soft-cover. Great book for the money!!"
4,Safe haven,This book was well written and it also gave a good insight into how the abusive mind works and theexistence of decent human beings who do exist all around us.
5,The Good Earth,The Good Earth is easy to read on my Kindle but I had a little trouble loading it. Problem was getting to know how to use Kindle.
5,Then and now,"The Book was given to me and I could not put it down, it open'd a window into old China but also showedthere and now that money does it all and nothing changes. If you have money people treat you with respecteven you do not deserve it.Pearl S Buck was a great writer, one of not many worth to have the title ""writer"".Love the book and if her others comming out on E-book, then I will read more of her."
5,The Good Earth,"I read The Good Earth on my Kindle and the digitized version was good. I had read this book fifty years agoand enjoyed it. Now with the wisdom of age and a greater understanding of life I enjoyed it even more. My heart went out to O Lan, the quiet, wise, and ever faithful wife. She bore so much and was not appreciated until she was gone. I think her second son saw these qualities in his mother and that is why he wanted those qualities in his own wife. I wanted to scream at Wang Lung for being so self-centered, but he did provide for his family. He loved his land which made him strong and he knew the value of hard work and true friends. Another but, he was weak in when it came to the pleasures of the flesh. I'm glad our book group chose this and I was able to read it again."
2,A book with a bitter ending,The book drags on and on and really about nothing! Wang-Lung starts off poor and O-lan the faithful wife stays by his side till her end. It goes on to show how working hard gained him more land and power. She could have excluded a few detail (or chapters). And the fact that he's bound to loose everything anyways when he dies is upsetting and you wonder why you even picked up the book. The section in the book where a 70 year old sleeping with a young girl is disgusting! Never in my life do I want to read something like that again.
1,An excellent work ruined by 'enrichments',"I have read this book many times and consider it one of the greatest books ever written. I wanted a new copy, since mine was worn-out, so I got this one, and was disappointed. The typeface was blurry and smudgy, and the paper quality poor. Worst though was finding errors by the person who provided the ""enriching"" narrative - she incorrectly refers to a primary character, Lotus, as 'Lotus Flower'. Nowhere is Lotus ever called this in this book! In another section, she incorrectly refers to her again, this time as 'Lotus Blossom'. Poor editing all around on the so-called enrichments, which ruins this book. Leave well enough alone, I say!"
1,This book is waste of your time,"This book was about a self centered man, living with his children and wife. He only loved her when the hard times kicked in. Then when he had his other pleasures he treaated her like dirt.Trust me, you should never read this book if you get to choose a book to read (unlike myself). It truly is a waste of your time! Infact I'm not really sure why I'm wasting my precious time typing about this book that really does belong in the trash can, like one of the writers wrote at the top of this web page."
3,Too much too fast.,"This book was an excellent piece of writing. It was full of details and had and interesting base: Pre-revolutionary China. However, the book changes too dramatically too quickly. They're poor but not starving then they are dying and go to a city and they come back rich and build a big house and have internal family problems. The book did not develop the characters themselves enough before they are suddenly somewhere else and having a different lifestyle."
3,The book was pretty good.,I believe that this book was okay. It could've been better but the way the author used China for the setting really set the book.
3,A Good Read,"I really enjoyed this book, I had to read it for World Lit. I liked this book better than the others we had to read. I would like to read the other two book in the series, I want to find out what happend to Wang Lung and his children. The ending is to long, but I couldn't put it down once I started to read it."
2,Want to be depressed? Read this book!,"This book would only be 1 star if it weren't so well written. Other than that, it's incredibly depressing. Why can't Wang Lung be a happy farmer? Just when things start to go right in his life, something comes along and destroys it. Read it if you must, but if you have a choice, read About A Boy insted."
3,"Excellent Prose, Dismal Plot","I know I read The Good Earth in high school - but I wanted to re-read it as it is on my son's high school reading list. I am struck by the almost poetic nature of Buck's writing, but I must confess that the storyline was of such a nature so as to leave me wanting to take a mental bath. Such hopelessness and helplessness of Wang Lung to overcome the downward spin of his pagan destiny was hard to read.I recommend this book to mature readers (I am going to select a different book off of my 15 year old's reading list) as there is candid discussion of sexual desire and its fulfillment. If a parent is not sure about whether or not a young person would be ready for a book of this depth, I highly recommend pre-reading it.I do ultimately recommend this book as I think it can reveal much about human nature."
3,A well written book with a great storyline.,"This book was a well written tale about a poor farmer who found his wealth through hard work and crop growing. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about the hardships one goes through just to try to get respect.THis was a good book but it had a few dull spots here and there. There could have been a bit more exciting parts here and there, but overall I guess I would say that it was a good book and children should read it to know about the poverty from the past and present."
4,My thoughts!,"Hi, I am 13 years old and only began reading this book because my mother told me it was the best book she ever read. At first only read it when I had to but as I turned the pages the story of Wang Lung and his epic tail of life in China during the 1920's ingulped me to the point where I couldn't put it down! It takes alot to get me intrested in a book and with The Good Earth being a historical book I was not ready to spend 3 months reading it. But as soon as I started reading it was a disapointment when I had to go back to the library and get a new book. The only thing I could find wrong with the book was the way it would drag on for a while and have no climax what so ever nad then the next moment it seems as though you never want the book to end because it is SO good. So my opinion is read it (even though it might take some time)and see what you think of it!"
4,Reread of a Classic,There are two reasons: It was so easy to purchase e version for i Pad I got it in 5 minutes.It is classic I have read a few times long ago. I want to read it on the long Chennai Delhi Flight.It was easy to read Did not cause any strain I am a lover of physical books But I am slowly getting converted to reading on my i Pad
4,this was a great book,"I enjoyed the good earth. although i got mad about some situation with o-lan i knew that this was part of their culture. i cried, i laughed. i got angry. this book touched every emotion."
5,interesting and heart warming,The Good Earth is a heart wrenching tale of young Wang Lung and his struggles to get by in a changing China. This book offers great insight into life in a different culture.
4,Go ahead but schedule your workout after your reading time.,"It has always been a classic. Reading it again with a book club didn't make it easier. It is a harsh story. Repeated history, still happening. Good thing I didn't read it on the Kindle so I could throw the book at least once."
5,BRILLIANT BOOK,When I first looked at this book I thought this must be a very book. But i had to read it for school. Being an asian girl myself I got to know more about my culture and the customs. I was very surprised to find it an easy good read. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a simple moving novel.
5,preindustrial life really stank,"This book is about rural life in preindustrial China, involving characters who are crazed by poverty and bored and decadent when rich; without religion or literacy, the leading character (Wang Lung) doesn't really have much to do with his money besides wasting it on loose women. Shows how miserable life can be without the consolations of modern wealth and non-idolatrous religion."
1,It waas so boring I haven't read it yet,My teacher gave me this book. I want to give it back. The text is boring. Unessesary descriptions. This book is a waste of time. All those pages and nothing interesting.
4,The Good Earth,"The Good Earth is a book of little action but a addicting story plot all the same. First off, the book is about a man who marries a slavewoman from a rich house and together they work through many troubles to become wealthy land owners. Wang Lung being the main charecter, takes on challenges such as famine and flooding and other hard challenges. Through all these hard times he becomes a person that although he is rich, he still works hard beside his family working in the feilds to have a better life."
3,Interesting Story,"I think that this novel takes many twists and turns. A poor farmer who suffers many hardships eventually becomes wealthy. He goes from being a humble farmer to a ""player"". He ends up sleeping with other woman from the local teashop. I think this is a book that may be slow in getting started, but once it gets to the interesting parts, your jaw might drop at some of the things you have read. This really has a focus on how much Wang Lung loves his land. Before I am finished, I have to say that I thought the ending was sad."
3,Overall comment - Satisfactory,"Dart box with the space for spare soft tips, but it's empty! Although the limited description on the site does not say whether this commodity includes any spare tips, I am still disappointed to a certain extent.Anyway, the darts' texture and weight are still good, and also with speedy delivery from the seller. Overall comment - Satisfactory"
2,"Pretty, but useless.","I really liked the style of the darts, but the tips were horrible and the body would not stay tight. Basically I just ended up using the flights."
2,Unfortunate,"I was looking for a good well thought out and scriptural argument supporting the King James Version and the Textus Receptus. Instead I read a book full of unsupported assertions and ad hominum attacks. He failed at convincing me because he made many bold claims but failed with the foundational point- is the Textus Receptus the error free 100% accurate Greek text and how do we know. How would we know? After reading this I read James White's book ""The King James Only Controversy"" . I was only half way though when I realized that the KJVO position is without foundation. This was a much better book and gave proper references with good footnotes. Save your money and time, get James White's book instead."
3,good primer for debate,"I also have the authers ""the doctored new testament"" a complete text of the New testament with wescot & horts differences, a must read for those who are part of the textual debate.This book (defending the King James Bible) although being good in what it represents is pedantic and at times due to its lay-out confusing to follow..the core sense of the book has pertinance but a review of the synoptic parrallels where there was divergence would have given it a more scholarly appeal."
1,This book is irritating,"The good news is my daughter loves the book and seems to be inspired by it (no success yet). On the other hand, I find this book irritating, sexist, and, in addition, completely off the mark in terminology. I understand that kids this age don't need an anatomy lesson, but all the experts tell us just to call body parts what they are and leave it at that or kids get the idea that those body parts are shameful. Naming a body part ""wee wee"" so that it can make ""pee pee"" goes past ridiculous into embarrasing. And why call it a ""hole"" for making ""poo poo?"" Call it what it is! Additionally, the book is completely sexist in that it implies that only mothers change diapers Dads reading this book to their daughters feel left out, to say the least. We have to constantly ""rewrite"" the book as we are reading it to ""repair"" the problems. I'll be looking for a better title!!"
3,"Shure Quality, But You Need Lots of Gain","The Shure SM11 lav mic is solidly built and has the renowned sound quality you would expect from Shure. The only thing you must know up front about this mic is that your preamp will need a LOT of clean gain to make this work effectively. I ended up selling mine because my pre-amp, which is decent quality (Focusrite TrakMaster Pro) just couldn't provide quite enough gain for this while it can for the SM58, for example."
5,Excellent,Sound quality is fantastic; I made the right choice. I use this mic for interview style videography.
1,Horribly Noisy Hissy LARGE lapel mic BOO HISS,"Horribly Noisy Hissy LARGE lapel mic. Maybe we got a bum one, but this thing blows. I have $10 lapel mics that are lower noise and higher output. BUMMER. Love Shure and usually love the SM series (why I bought it) but not in this case."
1,bad cheap boots,Very poor in quality and design. No side zipper. Not real leather. Materials are very thin.
2,A great American thinker?,"Martin Gardner has been hailed as one of the great thinkers in this country. If that's true, then America must be pretty hopeless.His collection of essays certainly proves the scope of his knowledge--as well as the superficiality. Mr. Gardner knows a little about everything, but the little that he knows doesn't stop him from making seemingly authoritative comments. To be blunt, much of this is rather cheap journalism, with the pretension of erudition . Mr. Gardner, alas, gets too many things wrong. And I will not be surprised when, twenty years later, the world finds him forgotten."
3,How sweet it isn't.,This book was full of helpful recipes for my aunt who was recently diagnosed with diabetes. She has always been a huge fan of pasta and chicken so this book helped her out showing her how she can have the food she wants. Having diabetes strips your freedom to eat what you want and cook books like this give diabetics a choice of recipes rather than a bag of rabbit food.
3,"Basic Understanding, Tests need work very incomplete",I found that the book gave a good basic overview of SMS 1.2. It did not however to a good job of preparing you for the exam. The questions were not even close to what the exam offered and the exam engine was often incorrect in its answers. If have been real impressed with the other books in this series. But this one was lacking something.
3,"This is a single, alright?","Okay, everyone, listen up: the 1-star review I read below was referring to this ""album"" as the shortest album in history. That reviewer probably didn't know the difference between albums and singles. This is a SINGLE, NOT AN ALBUM! An album has anywhere between 12 and 15 or sometimes even more original compositions. A single (like this one) has only a few songs.Now then, about this single I don't have it; I give it 3 stars because I'm a huge fan of Sarah Brightman, but you can get the title track and ""O Mio Babbino Caro"" on her Time To Say Goodbye CD and ""Heaven is Here"" on her Fly CD. So if you're thinking about buying this single, if you read my lips, you won't have to unnecessarily waste your money on a single that has songs you can get elsewhere. Hope this helps."
4,Earth-shattering conclusion to 1st Edition AD&D,"Ed Greenwood's classic, very rare and out of print, brings the Time of Troubles trilogy to its earth-shattering conclusion. To save Faerun, your heroes (levels 6-9) must journey to the legendary city itself, Waterdeep, and with the aid of Midnight and Elminster himself, they must challenge a god! When the gods themselves walk the realms, life is short, and never easy... an intense adventure, highly recommended."
3,Will the Real Halleck Please Rise?,"As is the case with most authors, Stephen Ambrose gives much credit to the subject oh his biography. Halleck is credited with a lot more than most authors give him, taking away accomplishments from Grant, Meigs, and Haupt and making him seem a lot less obstructive. Yet I still didn't wind up liking him!"
5,HALLECK: lINCOLN'S cHIEF OF sTAFF,"This book is an important component for any Civil War buff or ""Lincoln-ite"" to better understand the important role of the civilian who ""commanded"" the Union generals and must be credited with playing a very large role in the final outcome of the War Between the States. As usual, Stephen Ambrose rocks!!! You need to read this book!"
5,A Great Photographic History,"Seeing an old building torn down is like losing a friend to me. This books is like a family photo album of the dead and gone that you never knew but with lots of great historical information. If it's obscure St. Louise history your looking for, look no further. I am a trasplant to St. Louis and reading this book is like hooking up with a local whose in the know. Not only do you get the history and a photo of each building but you also get St. Louis' own history as well. I highly recommend it to anyone regardless of whether you have a connection to St. Louis or not. I will read and re-read this one again and again."
5,Calm and thorough,"This is an excellent book about the cold war, communism, and some of the results since then. Thank the Lord for Ronald Reagan! If you have any doubt, ask my father-in-law, an FBI agent that was responsible for catching Soviet spies. This book is excellent.If you insist on reading this as merely a ""left-bashing"" book rather than a ""learn-from-the-past"" book, I give you this: I read this book and then read ""Stupid White Men"" the next day. Let's compare: ""Useful Idiots"": calm, thought-out, all quotes. ""Stupid White Men"": loud, ranting, bends facts and in some cases skewed them.I recommend this book for anyone that even gives half a thought to ""better red than dead."""
5,Useful perspective,"One could almost feel sorry for Liberals lately. What with the roasting they have taken from the likes of Coulter, Hannity and Goldberg, Mona Charen could be accused of piling on. However, this book takes a much longer perspective than the others on the erroneous thinking of Leftists, dating back to the end ofWWII. With copious documentation and quotations she offers predictions and assessments by politicians, the media, and academia which have proven by subsequent events to be totally wrong. By direct citations she walks us through the Cold War, nuclear disarmament movement, and Central American strife. In each instance the Left (including liberal Republicans) took a side which ultimately proved to be against both US interests and world order.This is a serious study, with none of the uplifting humor of Coulter. But it is very clear and easily read. Dedicated Leftists should read it at their peril. Re-examination of one's deeply held beliefs can be painful."
1,The naive Neocons--The latest useful idiots,"Now that it has broken that the Neocons were played like violins by Ahmed Chalabi and his handlers in Iranian intelligence, and foolishly believed all the silliness that Iran thought up for them, I guess the phrase ""useful idiots"" now has a new and even sadder definition. Doing the misguided bidding of Iran, an axis of evil, is not an example of hard-headed analysis--it is utter gullible naivete.Can't wait for Charen's scathing account of how the Neocons turned America's credibility and intelligence services into the Keystone Kops, gullibly suckling at the teet of Iran. Good job, fellas!"
1,Freudian Title,"The title of this book inadvertently refers to the author herself. This book is ""useful"" to the extent that it serves the persistent neo-con tactic of preventing any honest criticism of US foreign policy by hauling out vacuous phrases like ""blame America first"" or ""conspiracy theory"" or ""moral equivalence"" or like nonsense from the Reagan/Kirkpatrick crowd. Skip this book. Notice the 100 or so used copies on sale starting at 1 cent? It's pap."
1,Useless Ideologue,"Mona Charen is one of many useless ideologues who are now patrolling our airwaves and bookstores. I would include the usual suspects, namely Michael Savage, Sean Hannity, etc, all of whom manipulate material to make a point. In sum, as my wife says, they fit the facts, or what they call facts, to their fancy. Ms. Charen does not evince a sense of balance or take the trouble to use evidence to support her charges. It is simply off the wall opinion. It is time that someone wrote a book called useless ideologues, as Eric Alterman has done to a degree with his What Liberal Media. Of course it is practically useless to argue with those who take end runs around critical questions. It is especially troublesome when neo-cons refuse to admit or even consider that the Soviet Union contained within itself the seeds of its own destruction."
2,She means well but it gets boring after a while,"While I agree with Charen's opinions on much of the liberal establishment during the cold war, this book barely contains enough information for a magazine article. The rest is filled in with a lot of long-winded exposition that feels like filler. After about the first 50 pages I was bored beyond tears and had to force myself to finish the book. I guess I was looking for a solid, quotable history of the American left wing pandering to the East Block during the cold war, and what I got was short on facts and full of bluster. It really isn't worth your time."
1,Where does all this hate come from?,"Mona now that the Republican controlled Senate has voted down Faith Based support, does this make them Traitors too?How is it that people who disagree with you are traitors?I think I have finally figured out what makes these neo-cons so angry...They know the liberals are better educated, better informed, more intelligent and disagree with their conclusions...Because in the world of Mona Simple...anyone who knows the facts will just have to come to her opinion...I do remember Mona saying women are ill informed...last I looked Mona was a woman...I guess by her own standard she is ill informed...Wait and buy this for 2 bucks on the Bargin Books cut out section in about 6 months...unless you benefited from that tax cut for people who make more than a million a year...then pay full retail...show me how smart you..."
1,"Our Current ""Free Market"" Economy","On the fringes of the political spectrum, we have people who simply pander to an ideology to make a buck. Mona Charen certainly falls into that category. She tries to show the evils of communism and show how capitalism won out. Well, I hate to tell her this, but we certainly don't live in a true capitalist society and haven't since the New Deal. If we lived in a true capitalism, a large majority of Americans would be starving while the select few would live off inherited wealth. Hopefully, ""crazy"" Communist ideas, like making sure that each person has food, medicine, shelter, etc. have permiated our society, and compassion, in the end, will win. Then, we can tax the hell out of Mona Charen to pay for social programs. Ah, Utopia."
1,Think about this,"Please. Please give liberals all your arrogant ""pity"" and contempt. We just swept the House and Senate and made your simpering chimp president a lame duck. We don't hate America or blame it first. We blame cynical republican profiteers, who devise simplistic useless policy and foist it onto an electorate without the awareness to know they're being manipulated. And you'll continue to lose as long as your a bunch of hypocritical moralists, who text-message teen boys from the Senate, rip off Indian tribes over casinos, beat thir wives, pay off their mistresses, offer to save your soul while smoking crystal meth, and stuff deerheads into peoples mailboxes etc. Good Luck coming back from the abyss, losers. Screeds like this aren't going to help. America has wised up to your lame tricks."
3,It's a Question of History -- Was Marx a Visionary,"It's a question of historical fact -- is Mona correct in her analysis? It depends on how you feel about Marxism.The conflict is between government based upon individual rights, where the rule of law concerns itself with the principle that all men are endowed by their creator with equal rights, this blind adherence leading oftentimes to unequal circumstances. Or does Marx's vision of the world as a struggle between groups -- and therefore amenable to collective justice under which individuals are judged by group membership -- create the more sustainable world?The historical aspect comes down to this. Given a clear set of rules and a republican form of government, almost without exception people have organized themselves in an anarcho-capitalist system to satisfy their needs -- a meritocracy, if you will. The only way that traditional social-democratic systems have prospered is through coercion of the minority by the majority, i.e. mob rule."
1,More conjecture than fact,"A bunch of gobbledeegook especially as regards Elian Gonzalez.Was she around for that travesty? The mother did kidnap the boy;she took him out of Cuba without the father's permission. As far assaying that all Janet Reno had to do to get the boy back from theloca familia was to knock on the door, the family here did everything to thwart the legal system, throughtout which Maryellisa kept getting put in the psychiatric ward. The media never left the poor boy alone.It is not anyone's place to decide where the best place to raise the child is except his living parent who wanted him back, Cuba's pressureon him notwithstanding."
1,The left and right have become too polarized,"I've noticed that the political books being written today are by the extreme elements of the left and right. I've read some of both, and I can tell you that all are mostly trash which distort the truth in order to support their dogmatic views.Here is a wake up call: most of America doesn't buy the trash being written by the left or right. This is why the parties (both hijacked by their radical elements) are becoming less important.This book is a waste of paper. Avoid the radicals and look for more reasonable voices even if you have to go back to people like Ike or JFK (neither of whom would last a second in the political parties of today)."
1,Useful Idiots: give me more!,"Bob, from ohio.In her book, Mona Charen claims Liberals have gotten it wrong on everything since the cold war. Before Medicare was instituted in this country, 50% of America's elderly had no health care provision. It was a LIBERAL (JFK) who proposed a health care provision for our elderly, and another LIBERAL (Pres. Johnson)who delivered it. It was the Republicans who fought the Liberal idea of health care for elderly ""tooth and nail."" My question: did the conservatives get it wrong on Medicare? YOU BET THEY DID!!I wonder how many of Mona Charen's, A.Coulter's, M.Savage's, O'Lie-lly's, R. Lumbaugh's, & Hannity's ditto heads have no health care insurance/provision, and think that a single payer, universal health care system is a communist plot? If they do they are not only idiots, they are hardly even useful."
3,the truth is out there,"strongly recommend Richard Lawrence Miller's Heritage of Fear: Illusion and Reality in the Cold War, Walker, 1988; instead."
1,"The reader is the ""Useful Idiot""",Do you know what the epitome of irony is? It's lifting a title for a book from a phrase attributed to the socialist Lenin (yet no definitive attribution has ever been cited) in order to disparage people on the left and advertise to conservatives.If you purchased this book and you didn't know where the title came from or what it meant you may just want to drop your sanctimony and question your true place in the world.
1,Unmitigated Garbage,"This is one book which should not have seen the light of day. It quickly takes leave of common sense very early on and, from that point on, is full of subjective drivel.Avoid it if you can - you have better things to do, trust me!"
1,"Raise your kids and shut up, Mona","Any conservative mom who works syndicating anti-democratic blather (I refer to democracy, not Democrats, here), as well as appearing on the chat shows while the au pair minds the kids, is just peachy in old Mona's eyes, whereas any liberal mom who works is driving our future generation into the ground.Talk about a double standard. I mention it because after slogging through this book and piles of Mona's columns, she's not the only one of these so-called ""at home"" conservative pundit-moms think it's A-OK for them to work, but not for other women."
2,patriots and Americans beware,"The book highlights the hypocrisy of today's right wing pundit: the author romanticizes war without having fought, pushes tax cuts that assist no one but their elite friends, advocates cuts in education knowing their family will never need public education and launches unamerican personal attacks on political opponents in the name of ""patriotism.""Also, please note that it is published by an extremist right wing publishing house and promoted by Fox News and other conservative media outlets."
4,Should be required reading.,"After reading both ""Useful Idiots"" and Ann Coulter's ""Treason"" (both books should be required reading for high school and college history courses), I am outraged that liberals in our country continue to defend an ideology which has produced the two greatest mass murderers in history--Mao and Stalin. And let's not forget Pol Pot and the 2 million-plus murders he was responsible for. On top of the murders of 100 million-plus people, millions more were oppressed, imprisoned and/or tortured. And yet liberals here in America defended these dictators, calling them ""agrarian reformers,"" or saying they were ""misunderstood."" Liberals have an uncanny knack for ending up on the wrong side of history, as shown during the Cold War, and once again today during the war on terrorism. These people have shown repeatedly that they cannot be trusted with U.S. foreign policy, and none of them should ever be allowed even within dreaming distance of the White House."
5,Excellent!,"This book makes a very good point that many liberals, when confronted with foreign policy, try to act like Jeanette Rankin incarnate--that is, opposition to military force at all costs. And I mean at ALL costs. It's like watching someone try to portray a hippie in a bad 60's cop show--and doing a pretty good job of it.The left is so quick to adopt anything contrary because,a ccording to them, nothing is wrong anymore, nothing immoral. But I would argue that failing your country in a time of war, providing support to confirmed enemies of the U.S., and turning a blind eye to the ATROCITIES of communist governments is wrong in ANY age!Peace and reason did not win the Cold War. Measured military build-up and tenacious foreign policy won the Cold War, no matter how much some people would like us to forget it. This book excels at reminding us of that fact.Oh, and isn't it fun watching Jane Fonda get old?"
5,Look at the other reviews...,".... ... On the contrary Ms. Charen does not just offer her views. Instead she has assembled quotes from a number of liberal or leftist people to create a mosaic that is very illustrative. If you don't like what is being quoted in this book do not blame Ms. Charen, blame the people who are being quoted.Many of the reviewers also criticize Ms. Charen for referring to the people quoted in her book as ""Useful Idiots"". However, it is not Ms. Charen who started calling such people ""Useful Idiots""...it was none other than now-deceased Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. He was referring to liberals and leftists who were useful to him in their support of his government and communism but idiots for doing so. The fact that it comes from him of all people is also...very illustrative...."
5,Vladimir Ilych was right!,"Vladimir Ilych Lenin said that the Bourgeois democracies would fall with the help of the useful idiots that would always defend the collectivist cause.Here they are, listed, quoted, referenced.Some are guilty intentionally, they hate America, and all that It stands for.Most are just ""in touch with their feelings"" Feeling first and thinking, if at all, later.Ms. Charen is right on the money. Her commentary is ilustrated, profound, and at this time, extremely neccessary."
5,Liberals...again!,"I'm about half way through this book and it's great! I have no idea how people blame President Reagan for things going wrong in the 1980's. And no, Gorbachev did NOT end the Cold War, Reagan did. It's just another instance of liberals twisting history to fit into their own agendas!"
4,"Good, but not Great Review of the Treachery Among The Modern Left","This book is a very good book for those who are interested in determining where the rosy view of the communists originated. The rosy view of communists and statists that we find today in modern American cultures stresses the fact that those working within the movement have on the best intentions for citizens. Such a view is ridiculous, not to say disrespectful of the human condition. The statists and communists view the citizenry as little more than a resource to be plundered. They were not nice and well-intentioned. They were mean and hoped to glorify the state. Charen does a great job of illustrating the many individuals who worked to help promote this view and make sure the public has been kept in the dark. All in all, I would recommend this book to all who care about why the public views the statists in such a positive way."
1,Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?,"The evils of communism? Because it's godless? This is sooooooooooooooooooooo crazy! Now you face the evils of fundamentalist Islam, so it can't be that bad, it has a god.... Your ability not to gag while reading this depends on how you think humans regulate their behaviour - if you think that outside influences have no bearing on someones behaviour (ie. income) - then get yerself a shovel and give mona a hand! Christians will rejoice at this ..., well, unless they're real Christians. There is no doubt that the USA has always had a mortal enemy and has had many many wars. Communism was just one of those, and it worked to give the public the propoganda to keep the system going. Yay! Lets all hear it for the rich people! Is Charen a white supremist?"
2,Proving the Right Still Doesn't Get It,"I'll give Charen's book two stars because it is better than most of the garden-variety, ghost-written dribble that passes for the Conservative-Love It Or Leave It-Republican canon these days. Charen is light years ahead of ... Bill O'Reilly and the Fox ... crowd..."
2,Good Information But NOT Very Deep........,"Mona Charen has written a book that is written well and it is obvious that she knows the subject matter. However, I feel as though after reading the book I learn nothing that I haven't read before. I hate not recommending this book because I like agree with Mona Charen, but hopefully her next book will be a better effort."
3,Non-stick Frying Pan is Oxymoron,"Does it really exist a frying pan that is non-stick? Yes and No.Frying Pan is meant for high heat. All non-stick cookwares aremeant for medium heat. The result?. A non-stick frying pan thatlast no more than 1 year.I have used the Circulon Steel 12-Inch Stir Fry pan for a fewmonths. Using maybe 5 times a week. It already start to stick.That means a relatively thin coating. Do not believe anysalesman about these things last a lifetime or something. Itmaybe true for a pot, but never for a frying pan. Period."
4,Great Local Map,Good News - It had our brand new street listed.Bad News - They spelled our street name incorrectly.
4,Useful hints,"Having read many books on the 'how' of improving memory, this one was a refreshing surprise. It shows, through an explanation of how memory itself works, why certain techniques are suited for certain kinds of memory tasks, what the relation is between encoding something into memory and how it will be retrieved, and many other interesting things. People who have worked with memory techniques already, or who have at any rate spent time thinking about how their memory works, will probably get the most out of this book.Like some other reviewers, I noted a tendency towards jargon. I also found the book's layout frankly amateurish (cheesy diagrams, too many fonts, etc). But these minor problems don't detract significantly from the content."
2,Wrong Key,I read this book to know how to improve my memory (for study). This books is a good for those who do not know how to organize material in notes taking. Once you learn something you have to keep it for long-term memory (sorry there is no answer for this in this book or other books so far I read). This book critisizes all other memory techniques...but in fact it does not provide any solution.
2,Faulty liner notes and inferior sound,"Faulty liner notes on this CD, hence only two stars. The notes claim it was recorded in Bremen, Germany in 1964, but half the cuts are outtakes from the ""London Sessions"" of 1970. And the sound on this is somewhat inferior to ""Howlin' Wolf: Live in Europe 1964"" on the Sundown label. Get that CD if you can to hear a good reproduction of what Wolf sounded like on his first European tour, backed by Hubert Sumlin, Sunnyland Slim, Willie Dixon, and Clifton James.-Mark HoffmanCo-author of ""Moanin' at Midnight: The Life and Times of Howlin' Wolf"""
3,Almost Just Another Wolf In Sheeps Clothing,"B grade to be sure, but a little bit better than most of the recent werewolf films.I actually didn't mind this movie as it doesn't take itself seriously for one minute and although it is strictly by the numbers story wise, it does have an outrageous sense of fun about it and some really quirky lines."
3,You Gonna Eat That?,"I have to say I was surprised by this werewolf movie. I didn't think it was going to be any good. Shows how much I know.Entertaining horror flick for teens with some nice slicing, dicing, and shredding from the big bad wolf. He even talks and cracks jokes as well.This is a movie that doesn't take itself seriously and neither should you. Give it a look see why don't you."
2,Did I really watch this -- ?,"Well, to be very simple: this film is a half-step off from being a porno flick, with buckets of blood, an implausible story -- modestly good to dreadful acting -- and the scriptwriter, and producers should be left on a hillside for the next busload of zombies. I'm embarassed to say I did watch it; but the time would have been better spent cleaning the bathroom... or praying for the whole lot involved."
1,How Is This Awful? Let Me Count the Ways.,"This movie is bad on so many levels, where do I start? It's sadistic for one, especially when one character loses his package in an attack. There's enough bad acting to go around. I think they thought they were making a good movie, which makes it even funnier.I did catch the star of ""An American Werewolf in London"" doing a bit in this career-enhancing movie."
1,Save your money...,"Save your money and if you want to watch this movie then wait for it to appear on television. The acting is dire, the plot is lame and the special effects weak. One of the worst horror and werewolf films I've ever seen, avoid like the plague."
3,Don't take it serious and you won't be disappointed,"After much waited anticipation and searching far and wide at video stores, I finally ordered the dvd. Because I had read several reviews on this site and others that were mostly positive I was expecting, finally, a really great werewolf movie to add to my collection...but was HIGHLY disappointed! Of course when I heard that the ""werewolf talked"" and made sarcastic ""freddy kruger"" comments that this wouldn't be another Ginger Snaps or American Werewolf in London. But I did expect it to at least be scary in between the punch lines...Cursed was scarier, lol! I actually liked Cursed BETTER if you really want to put it into perspective. At least the graphics were better in Cursed, BBW looked like a man in a bear costume-as I DID read in one smart persons review! Whooa, scary! Very low budget. But, if you have insomnia on sat night and nothing else to watch on tv and you need a good laugh, then what the heck."
1,what were they thinking,i am a fan of a good werewolf/vampire movie and ill give them all a try. This movie had nothing going for it. the nudity was rather lame. best part is when he makes the girl go down on him. watch if you want a good laugh at bad acting
4,Unflinching Werewolf Picture,"Big Bad Wolf is one of the better werewolf films to come out in the past few years, having a halfway decent plot. Its not a wimpy ""Howling 3"" werewolf either. The movie starts off as a standard ""Stupid-Teenagers-Stumble-Upon-Werewolf's-Lair"" story, then it turns into a bloody cat and mouse game between the wolf and a couple of the teen survivors.Be warned, this film contains some really graphic violence. So steer clear if you like PG-13 flavored films."
5,A true conversation,"Bill is an extraordinary visionary. What a thought to bring together scholars from multiple religions to talk about Genesis. This is a must read. The conversation is insightful and enlightening. No wonder Fundamentalists dislike Bill. He is fully inclusive and working to build bridges across the chasm of beliefs. Understanding will only be built through learning conversations, not by intolerance."
2,"So liberal in its slant, totally unbalanced","This would have been an outstanding environment to have a great discussion over this ""Beginnings"" of Scripture. I say this because what is missing is a clear ""conservative"" voice. Certainly there are several whom one might label as providing this side's views. There are many such Old Testament stalwarts who could have did this admirably, e.g. Walter Kaiser to mention but one.Thus, this book is very unbalanced as the liberal element is so prone to do: ignore the traditional, conservative opinion as well. You find it in all their works. While the conservative side most always reacts and interacts with the liberals, you rarely see it in the reverse. Thus, the poor unknowing layperson sees this as the total picture. Or hopefully not.""Oh, Lord, open thou our eyes."""
4,What is so wrong with great tribute albums anyway...,"There should be no bias against tribute albums and cover songs; they should be judged on the merits and results; in other words ENJOY EVERY GREAT SONG. In this case - you have Zevon's bandmates, friends and relatives doing a professional job and an intense emotional task of saying goodbye the the man who died too young. Standout tracks are by Pete Zorn, The Boss, Wallflowers, Ry Cooder, Jorge Calderon, Jill Sobule, Dylan ...but the best of all is his son's cover of Studebacker. Only surprise was the lack of a contribution from Something Happens... Warren's touring band in the mid-90's."
4,Wonderful and Meaningful Songs,"What usually happens is that the first rendition one listens and grows with is the one he loves best. For me it worked otherwise. Contrary to what another reviewer said, Zevon's interpretations of his own songs did not grab me. Ok, I was curious to see what he is about only because Dylan had expressed his admiration for him. And incidentally the inclusion in this cd of a Dylan interpretation was the reason I bought it. Yet the covers 'grabed' me indeed. Arguably the songs are nice, mostly expressing a solitary mood which suits me at this period of time. Moreover there is a uniform style in all the interpretations, so although there are some songs I like best I don't use this record to listen just to them but I go through it from start till end. Now, do they really bring out anything new or anything better? Not being I real Warren Zevon fan I cannot have an opinion, yet the fact remains that this cd is more enjoyable to me than his greatest hits."
3,"Good for completists, but Zevon does his work best of anyone","This posthumous collaboration does do Zevon's dark and outrageous wit justice, but no one does Zevon like Zevon. He's one of the few singer-songwriters who isn't that easily covered. Still, the lineup paying Warren tribute is top drawer. Bruce Springsteen's version of ""My Ride is Here"" could have been penned by his own hand. Jackson Browne and Bonnie Raitt rock out us on their cover of ""Poor Poor Pitiful Me.""The artists were well chosen for the tributes and all well done, but I'd still take any of Zevon's original work over this. Still, it's good to fill out your collection if you're a die hard Zevon fan like me."
4,I Hate Tribute Albums...but I liked this.,"I was still reeling from the horrible Johnny Cash tribute album when I saw that Jordan Zevon had produced one with WZ's songs. With a line-up like Jackson Browne, Bonnie Raitt, The Wallflowers, Springsteen (blowhard) and Bob Dylan, how bad could it be? It is much better than ""not bad""; it is excellent. I liked all the cuts to some degree but the Wallflowers' Lawyers,Guns and Money is my favorite. The most pleasant surprise is Adam Sandler's rendition of Werewolves - very witty and fun. The entire album is on my iPod - one of maybe a dozen of 300+. Thank you Jordan Zevon and Jorge Calderon for putting this together."
2,A Disappointing Tribute...Zevon Deserved Better,"I DO love a really good tribute album...but this isn't one. I was really disappointed, because I'm a huge Zevon fan.The only 2 tracks that were good were the Wallflowers cover of""Lawyers, Guns and Money""...and ""Studebaker"", covered by zevon's own son, Jordan. (The kid DOES have a pretty good voice)."
5,An Exceptional Tribute from Those Who Knew & Loved Warren,"I usually shy away from tribute albums but this one is an exception. You can hear how much these people loved Warren in their interpretations of his songs. Of exceptional note are Adam Sandler's ""Werewolves of London"", the Wallflower's take on ""Lawyers, Guns, and Money, and, believe it or not, Billy Bob Thornton's haunting version of ""The Wind"", (a never before released song.) I'm not big on movie stars who want to play rock and roll star, but both Sandler and Thornton do Warren proud. If you were a Zevon fan, buy this CD. You won't be sorry!"
5,An Earlier Edition Revieweed,I have reviewed the first edition of this text book in applied anthrpology. See below. It was one of the first case study books available and remains a useful axiliary text.
3,Good for the beginner,Order both the Blue book and the Green book - good information to get you started and improve your basic play.
2,almost not worth reading,"This book, has some good ideas and toughts, but it's nothing advanced, I was disapointed, I had expected more from this guy, but if you plan to play against the man then this is a must have, he tells exactly how he plays, wich in my opinion is way to loose, he's chart in the book advises to play Ax hands down to A5 offsuit no matter what position, also K9 and pairs down to 22, this made me loose all hope for the guy, he simply can't play, by selling this book he is hoping to make a buck, Im sure he cant win them playing hands like that, there are alot better books out there, skip this one, it won't help you to become a better player, in fact if you follow he's recomendations you will get worse at it,"
1,great poker book,"Well written. Funny, educational, a must read for anyone who wants to risk a dime at poker. loved it"
5,Great Little Green,"I have read quite a few books by the pros. However, this one is clearly the best so far. He speaks in terms that are understandable and he explains things well. I recommend this book for anyone in their early years of competing."
5,This book is really good!,"I bought this to help learn Hold'em and it is an excellentbook! Gordon has the knack for explaining and teaching clearlyso I didn't have to muddle through vague explanations like a lot ofthe poker books have. He takes you through hands and explains them step bystep, card by card and makes sense!!!Gordon knows what he is talking about! He is not just writing a bookto make money! I think most of the poker books out there are just writtento get you spend your money!I would rate this as one of the top 10 books on poker PERIOD!"
5,Must read for all poker players,"I found myself fully engrossed reading Phil's latest tome. Coupled with his new Expert Insight DVD, my poker skills have taken a giant leap forward. I have finished in the money in my last 3 tounrey's played, winning one.I have also seen Phil give a seminar or two and can tell you that he really knows how to reach everyone - from the beginner to the ""expert"". Phil's insights and teaching style really pull in the listener and help you retain the information - unlike much of his competition.Moreover, his success as a player has not dampened his enthusiasm to pass on his knowledge in a concise and clear manner.I highly recommend this book (and the DVD) to anyone who wants to improve their game immediately."
5,Superb book on no-limit holdem,"Gordon's book has helped my play immensely. As other reviewers note, it is especially helpful for play after the flop. I can't recommend this book highly enough."
5,A must read for all players,"The first book I read on poker was ""The Real Deal"" by Phil Gordon. After that was many by David Sklansky, and Dan Harrington. After playing for several years, I went back to Phil for ""The Little Green Book"". This book is excellent as it's not so much a how to guide, but more of a look in how an accomplished player works through a hand. Deciding on the best action to take to get more money into the pot when you're ahead, and recognize when you should look for the door."
4,"Poker, short and simple","In this new book by Phil Gordon, it's like picking his brain of all the tips most pros don't even think about anymore. After years of playing the best in the world, Phil has picked up tips that become second nature. What seems like a sixth sence is explained so that we can benifit from his experiance. Don't expect a novel. This time everything is in short, concise and insightful thoughts. First read through it as normal but then keep it as a reference guide. Each lesson or thought for every level or position is in here. This is a top shelf poker book."
2,Phil's book explains why he is good but not great,"Save your time and money for the books by Harrington Vol I & II and Sklansky Hold'Em for Advance Players. Those books explain the game of no limit much clearer than Phil who seems to have a it all figured out. Like he calls it, he is a good player but not great. Same with his little green book. He gives far too much information and offers to many caveats and poker jargon, most of which one either has to or needs to learn the hard way."
4,Concise and well written,"Good example, good math, well written and entertaining. Good to read after you've gotten everything you can from Sklansky."
5,Poker lessons,Fast easy read. Very helpful. I read this book before a major tournament and I finished in the top 10%.
3,Better applied for limit,"This books stradegy should be used strictly for limit because the stradegies gordon uses will get you in trouble in no limit and save you chips in limit. If your looking to improve your game in no limit holdem, there is many books that will help you. Evan beginners should go a different route. Phil Gordon appears to be a nice human being and all and he writes good literature but thats all it is."
3,Good overview,"Not a bad book at all. Good tidbits, need to reread some more. It may not change your game tremendously, but it's good."
3,nothing special,the book was OK nothing really exciting. i took this book on a trip expecting to entertain myself and it did the exact opposite.
4,Insightful,A good look into the mind of a poker player with some applicable examples. The writing style flows and is a quick read.
4,Phil's Writing Style,I am just a poker novice and found the information in here to be a good start but what I really like about the book is that Phil Gordon has a good sense of humor about himself and shares the mistakes that he has made as well. I found it was not too dry to just be a good read.
5,Phil Gordon's Little Green Book,"The book met all my expectations, as a novice poker player I wanted to understand the strategies employed by the pros and gain knowlege regarding the basic understanding of the game. Phil provided insite into all these aspects as well as his personal playing style. I thought the book delivered on all counts I have read it twice and expect to be reading it again soon."
3,No optical mouse functionality,"The Amazon review says ""Reads and writes Memory Stick media to a USB port with Optical Mouse functionality"". This is not true. I ordered this item and it arrived at my location on the other side of the planet today. It isn't a mouse. I wanted a mouse with a memory stick reader as part of it. I wasted my money and it will take too much money effort to send it back. Now I know that I should have ordered the MSAC-US70. I rated the product as three stars not because of the product itself but for the incorrect information provided by Amazon. The product is still in the package as I write."
3,A strange and fascinating record,"First of all , I bought this cd because im a big oasis fan, and because noel gallagher is an invited guest i bought it. The one hour long song ""mother"" is just awesome to listen if you dont have nothing to do and want to relax, the first 35 minutes are just some nasty beast and sounds, but the rest 25 minutes are just beautiful, the strings in this last part sound gorgeous, they make you imagine many things and get relaxed. The song temper-temper(with noel gallagher) is somewhat good and bad. Its good because the song is hard drinving, its bad because noel's guitar it has a low volume, what i mean by this is that you can hear very loud the screams of goldie, and the guitar of noel is not very noticeble, but still good song. The rest of the album its a mix of many sounds. You will find jazz, hip hop, blues and even a song with David Bowie.Buy this albm only if you like electronic music, because the album its kind of hard to understand."
4,"fine sophomore effort except for the 1 hour ""mother""","hmm. this double cd came out in '98 and nobody reviewed it yet? ok, here's my 2 cents. this is a very good 2nd cd from goldie but it's not his classic. that goes to his 1st one, TIMELESS. SATURNZRETURN features another stellar gorgeous tune by diane charlemagne with ""believe"". SHE CAN SING! she's cute and her voice is astounding (check her out in satoshi tomiie's new cd FULL LICK w/ the song ""inspired""). ""dragonfly"" and ""demonz"" are great also but did ""mother"" had to be an enormous 60 minutes! i still haven't heard it in its entirety and probably i never will. rapper KRS-ONE guesting on ""digital"" is pathetic! critics and listeners also panned goldie's collaboration with david bowie with ""truth"". it sounds slow, depressing, eerie, droll, but hey i liked it."
1,Tough to listen to.,"This album really dissapointed me. After the first half hour the music warms out it's welcome. As a big fan of both ambient and jungle, I hate to say it, but after listening my reactions were either annoyed or bored. While this epic tries to be the ""2001"" of electronica, it ends more like ""Xanadu""."
1,THIS CD IS A JOKE,Timeless was totally revolutionary. This CD is totally wrong. Goldie needs to be exiled to the desert to rebuild his skills and ideas.creativity is cool. but goldie needs to have some one in the studio to smack him when he gets all whack.
1,This cd sucks,"This cd was so bad, I had to take it back to the store.. the beats were so weak and the sound was so monotonous. If you like weak ambient music w/out a good beat, buy this cd.. better yet go get a real drum & bass cd"
2,"No big deal, actually no deal at all","i have heard a zillion ambient DnB compelations and this album would fall neatly in that catagory, thats if i totally forgot who Goldie was, and what hes done for DnB. the first Goldie album i bought was ""Amazing sounds of DnB."" that album is uncanny to me; it has been my expierience with some of my favorite artists, when i purchase backward in time, the sound of the artist tends to get alot more raw. in Goldies case its the opposite. this album and timeless make me want to sleep. Goldie has great samples, and his talent is with out question. but this these albums are just as boreing as the other wanna-be-futureistic Dj's on the metalheadz label of the time."
1,Disappointing series!,"While the first in the series of ""The Vicar of Dibley"" was funny and interesting, the others fell off fast. The series went from slightly funny-risque to downright vulgar. There was no need for the directors to go in that direction as the series had a good cachet to begin with. We were VERY disappointed in the whole series. Crude, rude and vulgar. I wish I could get my money back! It came quickly--the vendor was good, but the series is a loss."
2,Run of the mill sitcom,"Bought this collection based on the glowing reviews posted here, particularly those emphasizing the series' sophistication. Well. I sometimes find gastro-intestinal and female anatomy jokes amusing, but definitely not sophisticated. This series has plenty of them, and, sad to say, most are not even that funny. The lead actress seems more suited for standup than series comedy, as she hogs and mugs her way through every scene she's in, dispensing one-liners that aren't particularly funny even by television sitcom standards. The supporting cast is a little better, but after you've heard the grizzled guy with the lower g-i trouble joke about it, or the grizzled crone talk about her sex life, and the grizzled no-no-no guy say no-no-no a thousand times, there's nothing left. Except 16 more episodes."
3,"Funny, but. . .",". . .is there possibly an AGENDA here???The parish council is hysterical (except for the constant vulgarities from one member -- WAAY overdone); the predicaments are quite good (and somewhat predictable) and Dawn French is a gifted comedienne.BUT. . .Having grown up in a rather high Anglican tradition, and having seen what has happened to the church of my boyhood and a tradition I loved very deeply, I find some of the stereotypes painfully unfunny. Note the following:Male priest bad -- Female ""priest"" good.Tradition bad -- (Radical) innovation good.Parish conservatives bad -- parish revisionists good.""The Vicar of Dibley"" takes many of the factors which drove me away from Anglicanism and makes them funny -- sometimes hysterically so. But in so doing, a worthy (and fast disappearing) hristian tradition is mocked and ridiculed.Five stars for humor.One star for agenda.Average -- three stars."
1,I'm Sorry That I Bought It !!,"WHEN I BOUGHT THIS DVD SET AND KNOWING THE PAST BBC PROGRAMS I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING A NICE COMEDY, BUT OH NO. IF THEY WOULD HAVE HAD THE PEOPLE GETTING USED TO A WOMAN VICAR THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD BUT, I DON'T THINK PERSONS (""CHRISTIANS"") WHO ARE ON A CHURCH COUNCIL SHOULD NOT BE SAYING AND DOING THE THINGS THAT THEY DO, I KNOW THAT THIS IS ""COMEDY"" BUT THEIR IS A LINE DRAWN AND IN EVERY EPISODE THEY CROSS OVER IT EVERY TIME. ONE OF THE MEMBERS WANTING TO HAVE SEX WITH THE VICAR. THE LANGUAGE USED IS NOT RIGHT FOR THE SETTING, AND ONE MEMBER DOING THE FULL MONTY IN THE CHURCH HALL WAS NOT NECESSARY AT ALL, ETC, ETC, ETC. IF YOU ARE A CHRISTIAN, DO NOT BUY THIS SET OR ANY OF THE VICAR OF DIBLEY. IF THEY WOULD HAVE ONLY DONE EVERYDAY THINGS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD BUT THE THINGS THEY DO AND SAY WOULD NOT HAPPEN IN THE REAL WORLD. I'M GOING TO TRASH MY SET."
5,"Superb writing, comedy","At the opening of 'Service for the Animals', Alice's confession to the Vicar that she can't believe that I can't believe it's not butter is not butter has to be one of the funniest bits ever written. The Vicar's reaction is classic.We watch this series every winter -- it brightens up those long dark evenings!"
5,Can't resist,Funny puts it into perspective quite well. There is a bit of drama to keep it real. Great British comedy.
5,THE BEST BRITISH COMEDY EVER!!!,"I live in the UK and enjoy our comedys very much; greats such as Blackadder, Fawlty Towers, and Absoulutely Fabulous... However The Vicar Of Dibley is one of the best we have... Unfortunately for me America is the only country at the moment to have series 2 and 3 on dvd, so all i can say is that you will really enjoy the whole collection, i've seen them all and they are great..."
5,This series is the best,"I've seen this series on our local PBS station and if you need or want to laugh, this series will do it, be you Christian or not (I'm not). It is wildly hilarious and is also makes a good statement about weight not mattering, and the benefits of being an independent thinker. By all means, if you value at all your sanity, get this series."
5,Superb classic recording of Otis live in a Chicago club,"Showcasing all the power he put into his blues live, with a band that matches up; this is the perfect album to take you back to the 70's. The sound is real here, not all pushed through computers to ""perfect"" it, so even if a remastering is done in the future you'll still want this original to capture the tone and feeling of being there.I've been fortunate enough to see Otis live quite a few times, in Chicago and in Tokyo, and just last year after a stroke that hurt him so bad he couldn't stand on the stage. He had Carlos Johnson with him playing blues so sweet that the audience cried and gave them a standing ovation. That night we all saw that Otis isn't just one of the greatest blues guitarists of all time, but a truly great and loved man.Get all the love you been missin', people, get the Live in Montreux combo up there and really rock the house!"
5,Top notch live Chicago Blues recording by a master,"Otis doesn't seem to have the catalog of well produced (i.e. crisp, clear, loud) albums that truly represented his sound, at least not that I'm aware of. So this album is a very fresh breath of air as I would argue it is one of the Top 5 live blues recordings of a Chicago bluesmen at the peak of his game. Sound quality is outstanding, his gritty vocals are crystal clear (it is very obvious that Clapton is heavily influenced by Rush' vocal style) and his guitar licks scream from the speakers. I bought this and Son Seals' Live and Burning disc and I don't think I'll need to buy another live Chicago Blues disc for a long time. They both are gems. Turn it up!"
5,It worked!,"I bought this product because my new best friend was a wild man! He is a 2 year old pit bull mix I adopted from a rescue group. He jumped, pulled on the leash, and wouldn't listen at all. Within 3 days he was walking nicely on the leash, and was paying attention. Now my friends are just amazed at how well mannered he is and are eaten up with dog envy! He sits and downs with just hand signals!!!!It takes work, and time and following the directions, but I cannot be happier with the results! He is really my best friend now, and a pleasure to be with and live with. I wish there was a follow up video for advanced stuff, but we are going to try to get the Canine Good Citizen in the spring. A great product!"
1,Waste of time,This was obviously a pathetic attempt to show how to train your new puppy or dog. However these dogs were already trained so it was totally unrealistic. How many pups do you know sit next to other dogs without moving whatsoever. Don't waste your money.
2,Too bad...,"Visually, this production is a disaster. The director simply destroyed the charm of Tchaikovsky's creation in a twisted way. This is really frustrating, because musically this is an excellent production. Listen with your TV closed..."
1,sad story...,"I have almost nothing to add to what other reviewers said, except that I also don't like musical performance - Rozhdestvensky's tempi are ""strange""... Just want to put 1 star to bring the average grade down. Also, adding to the discussion about good DVD recordings of this opera - check 1992 Glyndebourne production (Andrew Davis conducting). If you can agree, that Herman/Yuri Marusin is very impressive even despite he cannot sing (or maybe exactly because of that) - you'll love it! If you don't like this kind of singing - you may still like this performance, because all others (especially Tomsky/Sergey Leiferkus) are magnificent."
3,Keaton's Brilliance Rises From the MGM Ashes,"""Sidewalks of New York"" (1931) was Buster Keaton's biggest box-office hit, even though the comic genius detested the MGM production. Despite his lack of creative control, Keaton manages some brilliant moments in this early talkie - a precursor to the hijinks of the Dead End Kids. Cliff ""Ukulele Ike"" Edwards makes an ideal sidekick for the Great Stone Face. ""Sidewalks of New York"" certainly doesn't compare to Keaton's silent masterpieces, but it's less painful than the MGM disasters of ""Free and Easy"" and ""The Passionate Plumber."""
4,Pretty good tracks,"To be honest I purchased this CD for 1 song and it is Jason Mraz's cover of Bjork's ""Unravel"", the interpretation of that song is beautiful. Tracy Chapman, James Blunt, Jewel and John Butler Trio all offer good tracks as well."
5,I've only listened to Jason Mraz...,"I've only listened to Jason Mraz because that's the only reason I bought it. He is absolutely amazing. I haven't heard him do ""Unravel,"" A Bjork cover, or ""Plain Jane,"" but they are both excellent. ""The Boy's Gone"" is also a great track."
4,Pop Culture Imagery,"A collection of pictures mostly from the 50's pulp magazines and movie posters. Good nostalgic fun from an era (so described on the book's back cover) ""when America was simultaneously more innocent and more paranoid!"". My only complaint- it left me hungering for more!"
1,Pig in a Poke,"The publishers of this cheap knock-off (the University of Michigan Library) should be ashamed of themselves. It is thoroughly unsuitable for the intended purpose, which is to provide detailed examples of correct lettering. This is on account of the fact that all of the figures were reproduced at ONE-THIRD SIZE. I felt like a complete idiot when I discovered what I had wasted my money on. DON'T BUY IT!Lettering for draftsmen, engineers and students: A practical system of freehand lettering for working drawings"
3,Mediocre version of Mozart's Requiem,"This Requiem is done in very heavy, excessive style, in spite of the small size of the chorus it sounds like something Karajan would record. This would work fine, many people like this approach. However, there were several issues with the performance of the chorus, which is rather rhytmically wayward (this is most evident in Kyrie) and not very well tuned. The soloist are not a good group either, I was especially disappointed with performance of Christine Brewer. It's not entirely her fault, more of a recording issue. She has a huge voice, and the way to deal with it was to place her further away from the microphone. The result is that she sounds out of balance in the quartets, and her voice does not come as bright as it should. This is a very mediocre version of Mozart's Requiem, for people who like this performing style of Requiem, the live version recorded by Claudio Abbado with Berlin Philharmonic (and soprano Karita Mattila) might be a better choice."
3,Print is here to stay,Kindle edition of this book was less than desirable. At least on my Kindle the main paragraphs were legible but the sub-paragraphs were too light to read. About three fourths of the book was illegible for me. I suspect I am being a bit liberal on my rating.
5,Nothing Like It!!!,"This book is nothing short of awesome! I can't believe they were able to pack this much vocabulary and information into one book at such a low price. It's just awesome. Buy it and you will not regret it! As for the one star rating... Don't pay attention to that. Not too sure what exactly they were expecting from a Spanish vocabulary book. But in this Spanish student's opinion. This book is one of the few ""must have's"" out there right now."
1,Could have been good ...,"The first third of the book is organized nicely and seemed useful ... Until I realized that it only contains cognates. I have no idea why so much effort was spent organizing words that are almost the same in both languages. False cognates are useful, but I am not interested in seeing 180 pages of cognates. The middle section shows Spanish roots for words, and while somewhat interesting, it didn't seem that useful to me. The last section was the most useful ... the 5000 most common words, although you could probably find these with a Google search."
4,Promising new authors,"In this anthology, Donald E. Westlake includes a lot of new authors who have not yet published their first novel. I had trouble following some of the stories after reaching their conclusion (GHOSTS by David Beaty), but others show real promise for the future.One of my favorite stories is MOTEL 66 by Barbara D'Amato. It is a fairly short story that packs a lot of suspense and intrigue. The story takes place at different points in time (1971, 1985, and 1999) in which two events that happened in 1971 come full circle in 1999. There is no real ending to this story except for the one in the reader's mind. This is what a good short story should be like. It should leave the reader wondering what will happen after all the stories secrets are revealed. Another one of my favorites is WRONG NUMBERS by Josh Pryor.There are some other good stories in the anthology written by Dennis Lehane, Shel Silverstein and Jeffery Deaver."
1,"VERY convenient, but dangerous","I used to be the canning queen of North America, and steam canners were the way to go. They are light years ahead of boiling water baths as far as speed and convenience are concerned. Not only that, but the lids ALWAYS sealed.To my surprise, when I needed to write a book about food storage (Food Storage for the Clueless) years later, I couldn't find steam canners on the market. I did a lot of research, trying to figure out where these wonderful inventions had gone.Turns out steam canners were taken off the market after tests showed they didn't get the food hot enough to safely process the food. I know a guy whose whole family was killed by botulism from home-canned products. Do you want to risk this for your family?I don't know why this is being sold, but home canning professionals do not recommend its use. If it were safe it would be the only way to do most of your home canning. But it's not, which means you're back to the Stone Age."
4,Good canner,"This is very easy to use. It's quicker too, because there's less water to boil. I just wish the rack didn't rust if you leave water in it overnight. The heat dial is useful but hard for someone my height to read. I have recommended this style canner to others."
2,Their worst album,"I had great hopes for this album. Madame Helga was a great first single and Maybe Tomorrow had a brilliant cool sound to it. Now to the album. Apart from the singles, most of the other songs are only half decent and not worth listening to. Jealousy and Getaway have a nice tune to them, but they never go anywhere musically. The opening track drags on to long ( over 5 minutes !) and you Stole my Money, Honey is boring. Their worst album by far."
3,A bit uneven but still good,"This album is a bit uneven and while the guys in Stereophonics sometimes make interesting music, they still sound rather boring and ""viscous"" from time to time. Songs like the melodic ""Maybe tomorrow"", the rocking ""Madame Helga"", the heavy ""High as the ceiling"" and the sentimental ""Nothing precious at all"" makes it worth to buy the album. But in my opinion this effort includes too many mediocre and even dull songs. Bits and pieces makes me think of Cracker's ""Forever"" even 'tho this album is far more rocking and raw. Singer Kelly Jones sings just as rough as Keith Richards look. Anyway, Sterephonics are doing a decent job preventing rock 'n' roll from dying, but buried six feet under a pile of commercialized radio pop it's hard to be heard. Help them out!"
4,Must love rock,"This is my first Stereophonics album and I must say that they know what they are doing. The album has great rock songs that let you get driven by the sound. Well structured and melodic pieces is what you get here. There's nothing fancy or too technical about it, but Getaway, Maybe tomorrow and I miss you know are mellow bluesy cuts that hit deep inside.If you love good, straight forward rock, you're gonna like this one."
4,The best album Ive picked up in a long time,"i just picked this album up, and i think its absolutly awesome, i cant stop playing it, i think if someone was to pick this album up they would not be disappointed."
4,Only thing bland about this is the band's name,"Forget this U.K. band's seemingly bland name. Forget that their sound, especially the lead singer's raspy voice, is definitely an acquired taste at first. For you soon become hooked on its ubiquitous layers of frenzied rock tunes mixed in with never-too mellow ballads that just keep growing on you, making this latest effort a gem and pure joy to listen to.Jean-Pierre Allard"
3,Uneven but still worth having,"This album is a bit uneven and while the guys in Stereophonics sometimes make interesting music, they still sound rather boring and ""viscous"" from time to time. Songs like the melodic ""Maybe tomorrow"", the rocking ""Madame Helga"", the heavy ""High as the ceiling"" and the sentimental ""Nothing precious at all"" makes it worth to buy the album. But in my opinion this effort includes too many mediocre and even dull songs. Bits and pieces makes me think of Cracker's ""Forever"" even `tho this album is far more rocking and raw. Singer Kelly Jones sings just as rough as Keith Richards look. Anyway, Sterephonics are doing a decent job preventing rock `n' roll from dying, but buried six feet under a pile of commercialized radio pop it's hard to be heard. Help them out!"
4,Great band from Wales,"The first song that I heard by this band was ""Maybe Tommorrow"" and as soon as I did I was taken instantly by the smooth jazzy sound. I hadn't heard anything like it in a long time. The Stereophonics were a welcome breath of fresh air and a change in the drab, monkey-see, monkey-do music scene. The entire cd is hot. ""Rainbows and Pots of Gold"" was another song that I loved. I enjoyed the dark mood of it and Kelly's voice is awesome. ""I'm Alright"" is cool too as well as ""Nothing Precious at All"". ""Since I Told You It's Over"" is a more upbeat song in tempo but the lyrics are a bit sad but overall this cd is a keeper. To anyone who cares to listen, give these guys a chance and you'll like the songs even more than the 1st time you hear them."
4,"Great Price, happy with purchase.","Bought these for NFL games.zoom binoculars are inherently bad, 24x25 is so dark, it is close to unusuable. Buy these expecting 8-16x25 and you won't be dissappointed.Field of view is small, but that is b/c they are zoom binos.For the price, might as well buy 'em.If you can afford better ones, go ahead, but the difference in quality isn't worth the difference in price IMO."
4,it only zooms on one side,Was disappointed at first when I found out it only zooms on one side but after using them It made it easy to put them on target buy finding with the 8x and switching to the 24x after you find what your looking for
2,Poor Focal Quality,"I ordered 3 of these for myself and 2 friends. I opened mine and tried them out and found I could not focus the right eye piece. It seems the eye piece does not extend far enough to quite bring it into focus. I am very dissapointed in these binos. I have a pair of Tasco 7X35 minis that I have had for 20 years. They have been the best minis I have ever used, but I will never buy binos through the mail again. I have sent them back for refund. I suggest you try and buy them at a dealer so you know they'll work for you."
4,"Very good, especially at under $50","After a year, these are a fine replacement for our older, smaller 'zoomer'.Minis dictate a small lense which means a narrow field of view. And so high magnification can make it hard to zero in on an object, Additionally, normal hand tremor is more problimatic at high magnification.This Zoom seems ideal for finding the target at low [but still useful] magnification & then with one finger zoom up to what's best for you.And, for me at least, any higher magnification would require a trypod.July 2010; after a 2nd year I'm sad to report a flaw developed after only moderate usage.The fold-down 'rubber?' eye pieces gave out at the folds.Still, at $50 I consider them a good deal though I'm mow glad I didn't give them as a gift - my original intention."
3,All those hard-to-clean circular grooves..,"This piece is nice and heavy, but the non-stick surface is embossed with circular grooves that are quite hard to clean. With a smooth Autograph-3 coating, I would rate 5 stars. However, have to limit this one to 3."
3,The show entertained my 4 year old.,My 4 yr old son enjoyed the show and watched it several times. I give this a stamp of approval.
1,Batman - Mystery of the Batwoman (Keepcase),I never received this product! Never buy anything from the infocaimon people on here. They suck with their customer service and try to play games on how and when an item should be shipped.
3,Better than I thought it would be,"Ive read alot of negative reviews about this movie, but I saw this movie at blockbuster and decided to give it a chance. glad i did. it was better than i thought it would be.it was well written, entertaning, and fun.the art is in the same stile as the 'new' batman adventures. but thats no big loss.the story is still interesting and engaging.the mystery is interesting.allthough the answer to it is a bit like christie's murder on the orient express.but still..good movie.basicly there is a new crime fighter in town.batwoman.however she is a bit more ruff than batman.batman trys to find out who she is. there are three possible suspects.at the same time the criminals of Gotham are out to stop the batwoman at all costs.batgirl makes a fleeting apperance in this movie.and as a nodd to Batman Beyond she clearly has feelings for bruce.bruce is doing his best to put her off though.all in all this was a good movie.so dont judge it to quickly your gonna turn down a good movie."
3,"Decent story, great climax.","OK, this is not the same Batman we know and love from the ""new"" animated adventures, but most of the differences are forgivable. The new Bruce Wayne is kinder, gentler and at times a bit hoky, as is some of the dialogue. The story starts to gather some momentum though and before I knew it I was way into it. Yes, the animation isn't quite up to par with the series in it's heyday but again, the plot makes up for it. My only real issue was with the Shakira-esque night club number. If you're willing to accept a slightly different/lighter version of our beloved caped crusader I recommend the purchase but if you're a uber-purist definitely rent it first."
5,I Liked This Batman Adventure A Lot!!,"I own the entire Batman The Animated Series (BTAS)on DVD, so my collection wouldn't be complete without this one.....and I liked it a lot. I'm not sure why some of the other reviewers didn't but I did. I thought that the concept was unique and that it had a great ending. Truthfully, I enjoyed it as much if not better than some of the actual BTAS episodes.The animation for the 1st 3 seasons of BTAS was superb. They changed it for the 4th season and it's been lack luster ever since. Still, despite the not so awesome animation, I liked this story!!"
3,Average,"I agree with most of the reviews here... it is better than Subzero but not as good as Phantasm - which is by far the best movie. The story was lacklustre and the mystery not all that mysterious. Admittedly my expectations were high. After all, the original animated series was superb and Phantasm was excellent. So it is understandable that I was hoping that this film would be great.... but it falls short. Overall the film is fun and of an acceptable standard. If you have never seen one of these animated films I would suggest Mask of the Phantasm be your first choice... and it seems that most agree with me."
3,"Great Story, Horrible Animation","Mystery of the Batwoman features a well written story, which is more than one can say about many feature films nowadays.As a fan of the various series, I found the animation work on Batwoman far weaker than on any of the television series or animated features. It is pretty horrible: stiff movement, flat looking characters, bad color work. Justice League is better every week, and it's free.I was particularly dissappointed that Bruce Timm's Justice League version of Batman was not used. With every new incarnation, Timm has signifigantly improved his Batman design, and it's a shame it wasn't used here. This one looks like the Batman featured in children's coloring books issued during the New Adventures of Batman run in the 90s."
1,Poor Effort,"This movie was a very poor effort and I'm extremely disappointed. The gave this film project to a new creative team and it shows, the animation was cheap, repetitive, the dialog was dull. Worst of all was the story, it was pathetic and dull. Return of the Joker was a superb example of the right stuff for this series and this lastest effort was just a plain joke."
1,NotGOOD,Attention BATMAN FANS!This is horrible garbage for the dump! A disgrace! If I could go lower than a #1 I would.
1,BIG LET DOWN,This would rank as one on the worst Batman features ever released on DVD. The story was very weak. Why waste the talented animators time with a sub-par plot. In a word .... SAD.
3,A nice fragrance but with poor staying power,"I was attracted to Givenchy's Eau Torride mainly because of its initial woodsy smell. Upon application, the scent also has fresh green notes with a touch of citrus. Over time, the fragrance becomes a bit more sweet-smelling, with almost a hint of floral to it as well. Although I really like the scent, unfortunately, the staying power is quite poor; after a few hours, I had to strain to detect any trace of fragrance despite putting on a generous amount. This is a real shame, at it is quite a pretty scent upon application and is packaged in a unique attractive bottle. I will continue using this until I run out, but it is not something that I would purchase again in the future."
4,Hit me with some more of the sprung rhythm baby!,"On those days when getting out of bed is a psychological problem, I take one cup of earl grey with milk and a shot of Gerard Manley Hopkins. Something about the way he puts his words together makes me walk out of the house seeing in a totally diferent way. Hopkins struggles with what it is to be faithful, with what it is to live in creation in a way which honors God, with what, finally, it is to be human. I'm particularly fond of this volume, just because it contains all my favorite of his poems. I've tried a couple of other collections of his work, but I find that I just flip through them until I come to the stuff that I like from this one, so what's the point. Carrion Comfort, The Windhover, and God's Grandeur are incredible pieces of work. I've read them, literally, hundreds of times and they have not lost their ability to challenge me. That, in my experience, is a rare thing; something that helps me get out of bed in the morning."
2,Wrong Product,I definitely thought this product was the textbook...I was wrong. This is only the activity book that suppliments the textbook. I just did not pay close enough attention
2,Moleskine Address Book,"Good quality but a bit overpriced, as are all of the Moleskine products. The shipping cost was almost the same as the price of this item, so in the end, it was not worth it."
4,Cheap!,"This used paperback was under five dollars when I bought it. For a price on a textbook, ya can't go wrong!"
4,"Good, but dated","Good review of the HISTORY of ethnic America, but a lot of this 20 year-old information is simply no longer valid - primarily stuff about the Mexicans.It was also somewhat of a slow read at times with a little repetition. It was different from a lot of his other books in that this one was not political at all. I really can't recall him making any of his vehement arguments on social policy like he does in some of his other books.Overall, it is another well-researched Sowell masterpiece that anyone interested in the interaction of different races, cultures, beliefs, and histories of the different ethnic groups that make up the American melting pot should read."
2,best spoof of Mars EVAR,"Wow, awful. My wife was mocking it as we watched it by making up the most stupid plot twists she could come with. 2 minutes later the plot took that EXACT twist. Seriously. This is the best spoof film EVAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"insufferable, absolute rubbish","The film ""Stranded"" looked promising but of course appearances are decieving, this is quite possibly the worst acting I have witnessed in all my movie-watching. The dialogue between the doomed charachters and their conversations are so unconvincingly unscientific and adolescent. This role is so inappropriate for the young, blonde captain, am I supposed to accept that these people are the brightest and the best? Luka's charachter is somewhat believable and he is the only redeeming part of this film, aside form the eerie mars landscapes. I suppose its worth renting, the crash in the beginning is so bad and low-budget it is laughable, KABOOM!I doubt that one of the brightest medical professionals would be as childlike and idiotic as that cute little asian lady. Also, the director should have done more research on the aforementioned professions of the charachters because this movie is a steamnig pile of poo."
1,One for Mystery Science Theatre,"This movie was bad from the very beginning. It took at least 10 minutes just to get started. The acting is bad, the scenery is bad, the script is horrible, and the delivery of lines is even worse! Even though the actors aren't native English speakers, they could at least do some acting. They appear as though they're not even trying to act. There are also some serious flaws in the movie--the astronauts walk around and carry a dead body as if it weighs a lot even though there's little gravity. And they don't even consider eating the body to stay alive! How dumb are they? I haven't even finished watching this movie yet. It was so bad that I paused it to come here and write this review. I also took a dinner break and found it more entertaining to watch my hotdogs sizzle than go back to watching this movie. This is one that could be a lot of fun for Mystery Science Theatre 3000--and even then it might be too poor to save."
1,worst movie since SWIM FAN,"this is a travesty, blockbuster does its customers a disservice by even carrying this peice of tripe. It contains horrible dubbing, and a plot line that starts at a crawl and slows down as the movie progresses. it tries to be ""artsy"" with slow panoramic zooms and pans, but it ends up just boring the viewer to death. if you see this movie in the store close your eyes and forget that its there."
1,A bad movie is a bad movie.,"If I could put 0 stars I would...Don't buy it, don't rent it, don't see it even if it is free... You should ask money to see this thing.Low budget is not a problem, but if you are going to do a ""huit-clos"", get some decent actors. They just don't know how to act and it destroys the movie.Go buy a burger and make funny faces in front of a mirror, you'll have a better time than in front of this movie."
4,This movie is Fantastic,"Well, it seems that some of you think that this movie is boring andpredictable, but this movie is extremely provocative, and extremlycreative. It is similar to the creative movie 2001: A Space Odyssey. Vincent Gallo is an artistic Genius, his style of Acting is so creative, that it blows my mind. Kudos to you, Vincent. Check out Vincent Gallo in the movie Buffalo '66; a movie Masterpiece, which i recommend anyone and everyone to watch. This movie deserves to be considered among the best of the independent industry: Requiem for a Dream, Kids, Lost in Translation, 21 Grams, etc.For those of you who are lost in Hollywood babble !!!!Open your mind!!!!."
1,Would rather give birth than see again,"This sucks raw hind end. It was infested with the worst acting you could possibly witness. Imagine third graders reading the lines: monotone, dry, deplorable. I can't imagine why on earth the producers didn't try to launch this thing into orbit before it ever made the stores. The special effects were substandard for even a 70s scifi flick. Toward the end of the movie, I wanted to hurt these people. I think I'll go kill myself now so I won't think about it any more. Don't watch it."
1,This movie is a sleeper,"And by sleeper, I mean a great movie to fall asleep to. The droning monologue through out the movie works better than a sound machine to put me right into dreamland. A documentary about a documentary would be more exciting. And if you're looking for a climatic ending, you won't find it here. And what's the ""R"" rating all about? They say the ""F"" word several times and mention masturbation. No violence, no intrigue, no suspense, and no special effects. Reminds me of the sci-fi B movies of the 60's, but only worse. At least they had a plot."
1,Worst movie in the History of Film,"You've probably read it here already . . . this is a complete pile of trash. The effects are all fake, and the acting would receive an F even if this was a junior high play. The low point is when Gallo propositions the female astronaut as they are running out of oxygen - adding ""we may as well die happy"". Another low point was when one of the men brought in ""ice"", which was obviously just a white, plastic cube.I have never, ever experienced anything - including TV - as bad as this."
1,"Expired, old, and very tough and chewy","The 12-box pack we received were a month away from expiring according to their expiration date on the main box. There is/was no way my family could eat 12 boxes of taco shells in that time and should not have been sold whether to individuals or business alike with that little amount of time left to its supposed shelf life. But, even at that these taco shells were already WAY past expiration in their shelf life. They were not anywhere near fresh or fresh tasting. They were old, very tough and extremely chewy. They didn't crumble or break like you would expect. These shells were literally like eating cornmeal jerky and not a pleasant taco eating experience at all. We all just settled for eating our taco filling with a fork as these were practically inedible. Threw them all away and ate the loss and filed the experience to what NOT to buy."
1,"Barely connected with FPGA, Practical? No","I was so disappointed after I read the book. I had expected to get some practical examples about implementing DSP in FPGA.I regret I was attracted by the name of the book and some reviews definitely not from sillicon valley . Except in chapter1""introduction"" there lists some basic FPGA concepts, I hardly say how this book was named as ""DSP with FPGA"".It does provide lots of mathemetical models, graphs for each DSP component, I believe it will be much more helpful to writing a PhD thesis rather than using as reference book in industry.If you are expecting to get some practical examples about implementing DSP in FPGA, this book might not be a choice."
2,Citrus Juicer not large enough for Lemons,"This is a wonderful juicer, except its size does not adequate enough for an average lemon. The dish is too shallow to hold the juice before overflowing through the holes. It does not have a catch plate or divet to catch the seeds. There are better on the market....still searching.Perhaps pictures of all angles would have helped me to make an upfront purchase decision.Thank you, anyway."
4,citrus juicer,The product was up to my expectations and was received in a timely manner My mother in law loved it!
5,AWESOME!!!!,"Yovee is simply what is missing from your C.D Collection - It is what songwriting should be and American singer/song-writing is missing in some bands today: Good lyrics, good transitions and something that sticks to you long after you hear it-You'll be singing it for days. It gets you in the gut. I recommend it to anyone who likes music period."
3,Likely to be good,"I have not yet received this item from Amazon so have a little bit of difficulty knowing what it is lke, but I expect it will be good."
3,Some Good Stuff,"A collection of 14 short stories. All originally published in the late 40's and rather clumsily updated with occasional references to the 70's for this edition.The stories:Deadly DamselState Police Report That...A Corpse In His DreamsI Accuse MyselfA Place To LiveNeighbouly InterestThe Night Is OverSecret StainEven Up The OddsVerdictThe High Gray Walls of HateUnmarried WidowYou Remember JeannieThe Best probably is The Night Is Over, but they are all pretty good, although none are especially memorable"
3,Largely for the Afficionado,"If you love John D. MacDonald, you will definitely want to seek this one out, if only to see how a great writer begins, before he hits his stride. This collection of his old short stories written for cheesy detective magazines in the forties shows the author's raw talent that has yet to be honed, polished and perfected. Indeed, those words are not just from me. The book includes an introduction from the man himself in which he concedes as much.That said, it is still quite entertaining and well written. Some of the plot twists and resolutions are just too pat and cute, if not downright crude for the writer that MacDonald would become. It is as if the pulp magazine genre was holding him back. But it is a page turner nonetheless, replete with delightful psychopaths, lowlifes, bullies and the seamy side of life."
3,uhm this didn't fit my 2000 chevy tracker,"It was not the part I was looking for, I guess I'll just have to buy the whole AC, there are no places that just sell the one part that I need. However, it did fit my dad's Chevy Blazer. It came in good packaging and good time but it just wasn't the right part for my tracker."
4,An Indespensible Resource for Win32 Programming,"This book is simply brilliant! It covers absolutely everything about basic Win32 GUI programming: from creating windows to thread syncronization.I'm new to Win32 programming, but found this book readable, with good explainations and examples, and it continues to be a excellent detailed reference. The CD which complements the book is also very good, offering updates to the book and code which can be used in your own programs.However, I do regret the lack of information about Common Controls, and a Message Reference, which are in the second book, 'The Windows Common Control and Messages API Bible', which explains why I only give four stars.Despite this, I would recommend both these books (and possibly the third for those interested in ODBC or Telephoney) for any Win32 programmer, old or new. In one word, indespensible."
5,Must have for the win32 programmer!,"Despite any errors in this book. It has the 1 thing that is lacking in almost all books DECENT examples. Combined with the MSDN library, and Programming Windows by petzold you can go very far. Today most people are so enamored with visual basic and wizards they never bother to learn HOW windows works. This book along with vol 2, can help you in get a better understanding of windows event based programming! It is not the end all be all of books LOTS of win32 calls are missing (after all its been a few years since 95!). But it has the core of them. This book is an great item for any win32 programmers tool belt."
5,Good book but does contain many errors,"An excellent book only spoiled by numerous typographical errors in the text although you will find the source code on the companion CD to be largely correct. Although Windows 95 is nearing the end of its commercial lifespan this series of books is still valuable to anyone wanting to write backwardly compatible Windows 98 applications. Although the typographical errors in the source code in this book are fairly obvious, some errors in the 2nd Volume in this series (Windows 95:WIN32 Common Controls and Messages API Bible) are are extremely misleading. For instance on page 677 it states that the EN_MAXTEXT message contains the identifier of the edit control in the low 16 bits of the wParam variable when it is actually in the high word of wParam. Another place it falsely states that the callback function used by the EM_STREAMIN returns nonzero to continue transferring data. However this series of books is still invaluable for anyone still writing in WIN32."
1,Stay Away,"This is one of the worst textbooks I have ever used. As for Heat transfer it is difficult to understand the concepts, and questions as the end of the chapter are ambiguous and is is difficult to understand what the question is looking for. The school required this textbook because of its cheapness to help the students, but unfortunately the book isn't a good one and I have basically been using another book."
3,SEEN BETTER! saturday 10th april 2004.,"For ages i wanted to see this film, well since it came out at the cinema. I was going to see it at the cinema but i didn't get the time to, and soon after i bought it on video. Maybe the second one will be better but i wasen't partically that keen on the first. It was not that good for alot of action and maybe there could of been. I like frankie muniz and hilary duf but this film dosen't go by the characters if you arn't a f muniz or an h duff fan you still might like this film. I thought by looking at the box that i would of give it full star, but really it is watchable but not a really good film. It is halfly actions and gadget and halfly not. Normally when you are going to buy a film i can always tell whether i will like it or not, and by reading the back of the box and reviews i thought it looked ace. You might enjoy this film alot but i wasen't that keen on it."
3,ACTION PACKED!!!!,"This movie was pavked with action. After the 10th time watching it, it gets a little boaring. ;)"
1,Agent Cody Banks,"What a terrible movie. I get so tired of seeing this kid from Malcolm in the Middle that I can't hardly stand it. This kid needs to go back to school and learn to act. Prime example of how young kids get ahead quick, start them acting at five. Terrible movie, I rented it for my son and he could barely watch it. Miss this snoozer and rent ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Ice Age"", believe me, you and your children will thank me."
2,ehh..?!,"Ok, this movie had some funny parts, but overall..this movie plain old SUCKS eggs, pan cakes, PLUS bacon..and I rather watch bacon sizzling in a pan for 2 hours than watch this movie. Man, this is no Spy Kids. Now the third Spy Kids wasn't that great, but the first two..now THAT was funny!! I loved those, but this is horrible. Why the heck did they make a sequal???? MY OPINION! YOU PEOPLE WHO LIKE IT I DON'T CARE THIS IS MY OPINION!"
4,Okay,"Frankie Muniz is not a hunk like everyone says he is. I recently checked this movie out to see what everyone meant. He says that he trained hard and worked out a lot and got muscles...May I ask where? He is shirtless in a scene and he looks like an average kid to me. I am a 17 year old (same age as Frankie) and I work out and train hard. I have muscular arms and abs. Do you have those Frankie? I don't think so. I don't know why girls love him so much, he is not hot. Other than that I liked it. It has a good cast and Angie Harmon is hot. Cody Banks is like a mini BOND."
3,Agent Cody Banks,"This is my favorite Cody Banks movie, unfortunately the sexual content ruins it for smaller kids....a milder girl boy theme would have been better for everyone."
3,Kinda fun,"Cody Banks (Frankie Muniz), one of the CIA's teenage operatives, is activated in order to get close to the daughter (Hilary Duff) of a scientist (Martin Donovan) who has created deadly nanobots that consume everything they encounter. In addition to the usual menaces one faces when attempting to save the world, he must conquer his fear of girls. This is an entertaining pastiche of the James Bond films with a lively cast, but it doesn't go anywhere that you don't expect it to. By the end, I was ready for it to be over."
1,god...this is a dull kid movie,"nothing but a little James Bond...little Jr. secret agent movie. bored with this..not much fun....cant believe someone thought of this...and a sequel to this junk....only to up the ante with teen stars Hilary Duff(Lizzie McGuire, Cheaper By The Dozen) and Frankie Munz(Malcolm In The Middle and Big Fat Liar)..this was mindnumbing with a mindnumbing cast including Arnold Vooslo(The Mummy and The Mummy Returns), Angie Harmon(Tv's Law and Order) and Martin Donovan(Quick, Insomnia2002)...for the crazy fans of the stars..others beware..some parents might find this dumb da dumb dumb"
2,This movie is OK,"I have seen better movies than this one. I am just not a very big fan of movies that deal with science, as Doctor Connors is the scientist in this movie that works in a science lab. I am not a big fan of science at all. That is one thing that I semi-loathe. This movie is OK. I do sort of like it, but not really."
1,The Really Stupid Garbage We Dont Want Our Kids To See!,"This movie was so bad that there are no words for it! Frankie Muniz is supposed to be 15, ya right! The whole time he looks like hes constapated or something! Hilary Duff's acting was almost as bad as her totally fake italian accent in the lizzie mcguire movie! Hilary duff has no brains at all and if she did she would go into hiding for the rest of her life for fear of angry italian mobs that felt insulted by her horrible performance and accent. Anyway this movie is total crud so dont go and waste your money. Trust me you have much better things to do then watch this cheesy movie that only keeps the attention span of a 7 year old! Go see a good movie with real actors/actresses!"
4,Young Spy,Cody Banks is a teen agent who is called upon by the US government to befriend the daughter of a scientist who develops nanobot technology. He gets nervous talking to girls and is awkward in his attempts to get invited to her upcoming birthday party where he can snoop around for information. Cody Banks is a young James Bond type. He uses cool spy tools and highly trained moves though his parents are unaware of his agent activity. Angie Harmon is his handler who advises him before his missions.
3,"Fun, funny and entertaining.","This movie is fun, funny and entertaining, even for adults. The plot is ok, the special effects not so much. There were some cool gadgets introduced; very James Bond for a James Bond-wanna be.There wasn't that much character development (especially of the doctor and the villain), but it's not supposed to be a deep and thought provoking film. The movie is like Spy Kids and Disney movies in it's presentation. I liked the movie. Angie Harmon and Frankie Muniz were pretty good in it."
4,Quality flick,"I thoroughly enjoyed Agent Cody Banks, and I actually just bought this DVD. Sure, the movie is mostly just fluff and recycled bits from other movies, but it's entertaining enough that you can kind of ignore some of its faults. Frankie Muniz is great as the young CIA agent thrust into a situation that he doesn't want to be in, namely trying to get some information from Hilary Duff's character. The formulaic plot moves along briskly, and the action and comedy aren't top notch, but not bad. I tend to enjoy a lot of the live-action family movies, and this one didn't disappoint me at all. I'm looking forward to picking up the sequel when it comes out, too."
4,Great movie but gets boring in some parts,"I rented this movie and I thought it was great, but it did get boring in some parts. Hilary Duff from Lizzie McGuire is in this movie and so is one of the hotties from Malcolm in the Middle, Frankie Muniz. I would reccomend this movie to anyone who is a fan of the spy kids."
3,So- so...,"I gave this DVD a 3 for the following reasons:First of all there's the story, which I have to say there's not much to complain about, except for Hilary Duff isn't in the movie that much. The movie poster says that it stars Frankie Muniz and Hilary Duff, but it doesn't mention anything about Angie Harmon, who is actually in the movie mor than Hilary. I'm not going to waste time explaining the plot because you probably already know...The DVD has many promising special features, but doesn't deliver. All of the ""Featurettes"" are under 6 minutes, and they don't offer to show anything terribly interesting. The only good extra is the ""Deleted Scenes"" which can be found on the VHS anyway! So in the end save a little extra money and by this on VHS!"
3,James Bond + Spy Kids = Agent Cody Banks,"This movie is really like Spy Kids and James Bond put together. It's got the Spy Kids humor, and the James Bond gadgets and action. What I didn't really like about the movie was that it wasn't that funny as I thought. Here something you shold know, it has some PG-13 humor. Another thing about the movie that I didn't like, was that it was very predictable. It has your basic plots. But something I liked about the movie, was that it had lots of martial arts action. It was pretty cool. This is a really great movie for the whole family."
2,What was it called again?,"If you want a brainless 90 minutes in which you simply do not want to think then this is the kind of movie you might want to rent.Frankie Munitz, mooching off what fame he has left before he becomes a 'former child star' is the Junior James Bond, a kid in the CIA. Yes, it's stupid but it makes things happen for a while. Hilary Duff is his would-be girlfriend as he freezes up when he talks to girls (stop it, you're killing me). Her dad is some scientist working for a madman (played by some overtanned Brit) and he has to infiltrate blah blah blah...Yes it is bad, but it could be worse, it could be the sequel. A film so bad and so quickly hashed out that they forgot they already set up Arnold Vosloo as a returning baddie."
2,shoot me.,"Dumb movies can sometimes be fun, other times they are just boring...nothing to laugh or study, all you can do is drool. Drool to the point where your wishing somebody would shoot you. You know what really kills me though (no pun intended), they're going to make a sequal...God help us."
4,Very entertaining - one word of caution,"I have to agree with most of the reviews already written. This is a very entertaining movie and parents will not be bored having to sit through it. Frankie Muniz was outstanding and I look forward to seeing him develop into an adult actor. Hillary Duff was pure fluff, but cute at the job. The one bit of caution I do give to parents is that there is one scene that was probably not necessary to show, and could prove to be upsetting for younger viewers and that is the scene with the bad guy and the way his demise is depicted. Not a pretty site for younger viewers. All in all a very good movie for teens."
1,If I could I'd give it 0 stars,"OK, now what. The movie biz can't think of anything good to make anymore. Really, like the CIA is gonna take this 14 year old kid and have him be an agent. If they really needed intel, they'd sent a real agent in. Maybe the little kids will like it, but no one over the age of 10 should. It's completely lame. Agent Cody Banks whooo now I'm scared. Come on movie guys, make something NOT completely stupid."
1,Yuck!,This movie sucks! Bad story! Like a kid is gonna be in the cia duh! Bad acting The stuck up Hillary duff and Frankie Muniz... Bad combination! Plus Cody (Frankie Muniz) is such a wimp! he has to run at the bad guys and punch them cause' he is so weak! Bad movie! Why would a kid wanna be in the cia??? The cia is evil!

4,EVEN HENRY VIII WOULD HAVE APPROVED,"This is a very good book, the houses chosen are first rate and the text well researched and informative. The images are very well done, they are crisp and well presented. Some of the houses chose are amazing, frankly Tudor is not my favorite of the Eccletic styles, I really prefer Beaux Art and Georgian, but this book made me appreciate the beauty of the Tudor. I highly recommend this book, it made me fan of the style."
1,Not Martin Sheen,"First of all, the content of this documentary is excellent. However, it is NOT the version on Smithsonian Channel HD that is narrated by Martin Sheen. Make no mistake, it is the same documentary, just with a different narrator. Unlike Sheen, this narrator is outright boring. Every other aspect of this 6-part documentary is the same. I was very disappointed in this product, as I loved the one I saw on TV."
1,BUYER BE WARNED,"Buy with caution.........I am not sure what is going on but there is no picture, only sound. We tried it on three different machines and had no luck."
1,French Revisionism instead of accuracy and fact checking,"Remember, this is a French production with French bias. If I did not know better I would think the French and Russians were responsible for winning the war based on this DVD set as there is, comparatively speaking, very little coverage or footage of the air war, the level of American involvement in the ETO, the Pacific Theater and nothing of the CBI Theater. Antisemitism, collaboration and complicity were rampant in France long before the war. There were numerous factual errors and mispronunciations; how Tarawa was pronounced on the English version broke my heart :( The Bonus Footage was nonexistent with regard to my expectations and reason for buying this set."
3,Blu Ray Review,"Apocalypse World War II is an average WWII documentary. Most of the footage has been seen before, the unseen footage comes from the French Point of View because after all this was originally broadcasted on French television. The original image has been zoomed in to create a ""fake"" widescreen view and the top and bottom of the image is lost. As far as HD quality goes, its hard to judge old footage but some episodes do look better than others. I would recommendThe World at War [Blu-ray] over this set, they both share many of the same footage but The World At War looks much much better and is a better series overall."
5,"Fine French/Belgian Doco,","This is one of the better WW2 Documentries I've seen, Ok, most of us have seen a lot that's included here before. But this new point of view is so refreshingly european, and the colourising is so good I didn't grasp it until I saw flames from a building and they looked real, I thought ""thats odd for a black and white Doco"" then it hit me that there was subtle colour everywhere. Brilliant innovation. As to the action, well the Americans still get the lions share of credit (as it should be) but it explores other minor nations efforts in removing fascism from europe. Plus the plight of civilians often ignored in other documentries. I found when watching the ""Extras"" that it could have been much more graphic and gory had they included footage of a tank salvage (thankfully in B/W) that was left out of the main feature, plus 100's of feet of previously unused film that had to be culled due to costs. well worth a look... Tanjil"
4,Truely Never Been Seen Footage!,"A lot of never been seen footage. Colorized but well done! A great time line presented in this series. For the serious WW II buff, I would highly recommend it!"
5,Apocalypse,Well edited and historically correct. Covers some new ground and some new film clips make it a worthwhile addition to any history-minded person to add to their collection
2,Disappointing book,"The title of this book promises insights how to build architecture for embedded real-time systems. Of course the book lists lots of patterns and follows the way such patterns are usually described (Problem, Structure, Consequences). Unfortunately this list is not new at all and the descriptions are not going into a level of detail to really help in practice. E.g. in Concurrency Patterns beside others the round robin pattern and static priority pattern are described. Later under Resource Patterns the priority ceiling pattern is presented. I would recommend reading the book from Burns and Wellings or one about RMA to learn how to build real-time systems. Such books present real-time systems in a much more structured way and present the common problems and solutions in more detail. Patterns are important, but just listing patterns to fill a book is not enough."
5,Excellent book for pattern folk,"This text is being used in a company wide campaign to improve system Software quality and Time to Market.I have found that many of the older problems as well as more recent ones are usually due to partial realization that the code is indeed using a pattern, but not instantiating all of it. The text continues to be an excellent resource while in training. Waiting for a chance to actually do something with it in practice"
3,A good little album for memories,"This album looks lovely on the outside. I'm not the biggest fan of plastic pocket photo albums, but if that's what you're looking for, this is a good one."
5,Awesome!!!,Dvd arrive on time and sound and songs are great. recommended...very good purchase add on my video spanish collection.
2,a silly book,"This book is fairly silly and simple. Basically the other uses one line from a research study and ties a story to it to prove the point. Definitely not a book of any depth or great insight, but can be enjoyable."
3,Slow/Delayed Delivery f,"I've used Amazon before and have been pleased, however, One book from this order has yet to be received by the party I sent it to."
3,Entertaining danish rewrite of Catcher in the Rye,"Extremely funny book written of the most popular, danish writer in the fifties and sixties, Leif Panduro."
1,Argh!,"I'm Icelandic and I have to read this book at school. This is one of the most boring and uninteresting books I have ever suffered through. Not only are the characters uninteresting stereotypes but the style of writing amazingly cheap. If you want to read danish literature, there are plenty of books that are better than this. Stay away from Panduro."
5,Great on my desk and good sensitivity,"Nice microphone. It looks nice on my desk. I made some recordings and the quality was great. Good sensitivity too - I accidentally leaved the recording device on and went to another room to talk with my parent, and it recorded it! The sound was small but it was clear. Don't hesitate and BUY it!!!"
3,Not for Everyone!,"This device picks up sound pretty good but the quality of it is kind of muddled. It's okay for the occasional conversation but not suited for avid communicators. I ended up giving it to a relative that seems to like it, so to each his/her own."
5,Love it,"I saw the pictures online but I was still surprised when I saw how small this mic was. I love it. It can be placed anywhere and contrary to some of the other reviews, I have to say I can be on the other side of the room and it still picks up my voice fine. Great product for a minimal price."
4,Very basic...right for the price...,"I picked this microphone b/c it was the cheapest one I could find that had decent customer reviews. And I agree...if you're looking for something cheap that does what it's supposed to do, look no further. This microphone is great for voice chat. I've also used it to record some music...it's nowhere close to professional level, but for a my purposes, it works fine. I do wish it had an on/off switch...I leave it plugged in, meaning it's on all the time."
4,Incredible,"I am shocked at the quality. When I bought this mic I expected so so quality sound at best. I also expect it wouldn't have great pick up at distance. Well I am surprised at how this little bugger works. It sits on my desk a couple of feet from my mouth and picks up sound perfectly. It has incredible sound with little static. I was really shocked at how natural this mic sounded. I use it mainly for gaming purposes, but I am sure this would work wonders for phone, or even dictation due to it's clarity."
1,Does not pick up sound with enough volume,This microphone only works when it is held close to the sound source (i.e. mouth).I was disappointed that mounting on the PC screen was too far away to pick up voice volume.
4,works good,this little mic works pretty good and is pretty sensitive. i've had it for about 4 months and no problems so far.
3,Recommended only if sitting close to it,"Pros:It's less than 5 bucks.Voice capture is decent.Super long wire (5+ ft?)Cons:Weak unless boostedExtremely limited range (2 ft or so to be audible)For the price, you should know what you are getting into before reviewing. That said, it will pick up sound within a short distance. This isn't a problem for me because I place it at the edge of my desk, which is within 2 ft of my face. The device hears my voice just fine, but don't expect it to record music or anything. All in all, if you need to do simple conversing with others, it should be OK"
2,Junk,This Mic is junk. Poor quality and very poor sound. Yes it was only 10.28 and you get what you pay for.
5,Excellent omni directional mic,"This is a great mic as long as you remember that is is an omni directional sound pickup device, so yes, it will pick up sounds from all around - it's supposed to.The quality of the sound from this mic is amazing. I've taped this little gem to the mic boom on my (much more expensive) headset when I record sound notes. It beats the mic on my headset hands down.I like it so much I bought a couple of dozen of them for business use."
4,headset free at last,"fine little mic for headset free skype sesssions etc. Note it's analog only - not usb, so noise quality will be dependent on whatever input circuitry you are plugging into"
1,Does not work for Mac Pro (the tower),"As of now, I'm still trying to figure out if this works for an Quad-Core Intel Mac Pro running Mac OS X (10.5.8) and the verdict so far...No, it does not work. The mic seems simple enough. One plug from the Mic connects to the Mac via the plug in the back of the Mac. Done.Then you go to System Preferences and fiddle around with the Sound panel specifically the Input. Two options ""Line In"" and ""Digital Out"". I tried both and nothing. I even tried Output just in case I didn't understand if a mic was an ""output"" but again that'd be a ""Does Not Work"" either situation.Maybe I'm missing something. This doesn't come with anything else besides a registry piece of paper so there's no driver or installation cd.So until this works, it's a one star for this Mic."
2,Too quiet,"Even with amplification at full strength, this was barely audible when placed on my monitor or clipped to my collar. You basically have to hold it right to your lips to get decent sound out of it. If you're willing to do that, it's OK, but otherwise it's not good. It should at least come in a different form factor (like maybe a rigid stick) so that it's easier to hold to your mouth if that's the intended use."
2,"Doesn't remove odors, or chemicals","I bought this product years ago after reading a rave review about how it removes odors from apartments. The writer claimed that perfumes make him ill, but now people can come into his office perfumed to the max and with the IQ Multi-Gas on it's no problem. I am chemically sensitive and live in an apartment building. I bought this hoping it would get rid of odors from other apartments. When people wear perfumes downstairs the odors can come right into my place and linger for hours regardless of the setting of the air purifier. Burnt food in the kitchen? Open your window the purifier will do nothing for the smoke or smell.When I asked an industrial safety and health specialist about this model he said IQ makes the best air purifiers on the market but that the filters are just too small to effectively remove gasses."
1,Didn't work ~,"I spent the extra money for this item, expecting that it would filter out perfumes and other chemical odors, however, it is simply recirculating them instead. I can smell the perfume in the ""clean"" air coming out of the filter, and also smell it when I open the filter to check the cartidges."
2,Expensive to Maintain,"We invested in this pricey air purifier because we moved into newly built home. The chemicals from the new materials caused respiratory issues with myself and my daughter. The unit itself definitely helped the issue of airborne chemicals yet the 4 gas cartridges didn't last nearly as long as the manufacturer stated. In fact, the unit itself began to emit chemical odors after 6 months. I have had to replace the gas cartridges 3 times since I purchased this system and at $295 each time I'm not sure how much longer we can afford to keep it running."
4,Together at last!,"In Volume 3, the Ronin Warriors are finally reunited as Rowen is rescued from his hiding place in space (although it takes them two episodes to get the poor guy!). With this volume, the Ronins get their first good look at the evil Talpa and make it into the city he has occupied --- where, naturally, danger lurks around every turn. We also learn something very interesting about Anubis...is he really all bad? I gave this disc 4 stars because of ""Assault On The Dynasty"", which has to be the most horrendously drawn episode of the series. Guess the regular artists were on vacation. (In its defense, though, it does have the scene where Ryo slaps Yuli, which seems to be a favorite for a lot of RW fans.)"
4,Recensione a proposito del libro di Sde-Or e Eyal,"Grande ausilio per chi pratica si allena a difendersi e combattere in strada,il Krav Maga spiegato e illustrato dal suo inventore e dai suoi grandi allievi Master."
2,Material seems poorly presented,"Having studied the 5 part Krav Maga video series,which was excellent, and then comparing that information presented with this book, I was disappointed. This book is supposed to be the only authorized written guide for a fighting system developed over a plus 30 year period. This fighting system is widely respected and adopted by many institutions, yet the book does not address in any significant detail, the basic building blocks upon which the rather advanced techniques which are shown must be based. The book addressed defense against knife, handgun, long gun, multiple bad guys, and hand grenade (I'm not joking). Yet basic stances, blocks, strikes, and training methods are barely discussed. As a manual or reference guide, this book is very poorly written. Purhaps I missed the point and the purpose of the book was not to instruct by rather to foster interest in people with regard to this self defense system by showing its capabilities."
3,Not the greatest,"There has been much hype for Krav Maga and its self defense benefits. I purchased this book with high hopes that it could provide some insight into the frightening realism of defense from an armed assailant. What I got, however, was several techniques which give you less than a fifty fifty chance of survival from a dangerous encounter. Ground fighting is non existant, and the manner in which you defend yourself in several of these situations does not include controlling the weapon, a fundamental concept in street effective self defense. Overall, I would not reccomend this book for anything more than a reference to Krav Maga as opposed to a self defense manual."
5,Krav Maga: How to Defend Yourself Against Armed Assault,"An excellent addition to any Kravist's reference library written by the founder of Krav Maga, Imi Sde-Or Lichtenfeld, and Eyal Yanilov."
1,Krav Maga = Nothing New,"There is nothing new in this book that has not been taught before by other self defense systems or martial arts instructors and CQB instructors such as Col. Applegate (taught in 1943), Fairbairn, Sykes. This system is nothing more than an eclectic blend of martial arts with a Israeli label. This is not to say that some of the techniques are without merit. These techniques are designed to face an armed adversary, which in the middle east it is a high probability, not in the U.S.A. at least not yet. If you feel the odds are against you for facing an armed attacker, then carry a gun and learn some unarmed self defense techniques. Again, this book has some merits for soldiers and anti-terrorist troops. For the civilian interested in self-defense there are many more books published which have more to offer the reader. Pass on this book and check my listmania on self-defense boooks."
2,But where's the proof?,"This book is good for what it includes, but there is a glaring and shocking omission! There is no info on proof sets, only on some individual coins. With the introduction of state quarter sets, annual proof sets have become a hot commodity, yet this book completely overlooks the entire category!"
1,Warning - these are NOT authentic Stokke sheets,"I bought these from Babyage since I was having a hard time getting the Stokke Jr Fitted Sheets for our son. I bought two sets and when they arrived I was shocked. They were not from Stokke, but a company called Cocala (sp?) and the quality was horrible. The Stokke ones are suppose to be 400 thread count and these had to be like 180 thread count - scarchy and rough. I contacted babyage immediately via their customer service email link and over a week later I have yet to hear back from them."
2,Sizing issues,"It's a nice hat, but sized smaller than indicated on the seller's chart. A Medium/Large was too small for a 7 3/8 - probably OK for a 7 1/8, but that's a big variance. Sure wish they had an Extra Large! Seller accepted return, but I had to pay postage both ways, so I think I lost money on the deal ..."
4,A great reference,"A great reference for those learning to cook and bake with coconut flour. It is not easy to do without a good reference and this one is great, and the recipes are very helpful, and gives you ideas on how to incorporate coconut flour in your other recipes."
5,Bought as a gift!,I bought this book for my Mom as a gift for better health. She likes some of the receipts but not all. She likes the book & asked for more of Bruce Fife books. She now uses coconut flour instead of white flour!!!
4,great recipes!,"I'm working on going lower carb and gluten free and also apparently have an allergy to almond flour (another popular GF ingredient). I'm pretty picky about cooking, too (I like my food to taste amazing, not just fill my stomach), and I've found many of the recipes so far to be quite tasty. The best part about using coconut flour is that you use so little as it expands in moisture, though many of the recipes use a lot of eggs to create the texture, which I actually like. Your pancakes and muffins will taste or feel different, but the recipes are solid and easy to tinker with to add more flavor. I just love not having the over-carbed feeling after my morning pancakes. They're so light and almost crepe-like. So far that's my fave recipe, but there are a wide variety of others I'm working my way through. All have been tasty so far."
1,Frustrating recipes,"I'm sorry but the recipes just do not work. I tried 2 recipes before writing this review. The last recipe was cinnamon cookies. It says to roll the cookies in cinnamon before baking but the batter is so liquid you can pour it. So my cookies are baking in a casserole dish as a small cake. I followed this recipe to the letter, because the first recipe I tried didn't work either but I changed an ingredient, so gave him the benefit of the doubt.However, after reading the other reviews, maybe the muffin recipes actually work. I cannot eat wheat so I plan on trying a few more recipes because at least it can satisfy a sugar craving, but don't expect too much from this cookbook and be prepared to salvage the recipe.My cookie recipe that I salvaged tasted good the next day, so that's a good thing, but the fact that I had to bake it like a cake, says a lot about the book."
5,A wonderful source of grain-free basics!,"After 5 years of cooking grain-free I have found that almond and coconut flour to be the best non-grain products for baking and cooking. This cookbook is a wonderful resource for basic cooking with coconut flour. The recipes are straightforward, easy to follow and give good basic recipes that are easily ""tweaked"" if your creative bent is such. I use this book as the rule-of-thumb guidline of basics. These are not full-flavored recipes but much of that is for the chef to improve upon. For instance, a pie recipe will show you how to make the filling and crust with no frills but frills are easily adapted to the recipe by you. I usually add more flavoring to any recipe dish I make anyway. On another note: the cakes are AWESOME! I love this resource."
2,Recipes use sugar -- NOT low carb!,"Coconut flour may be low-carb, but these recipes are NOT. Many of them use cups of sugar, for example, which means the book is all but useless to a low-carb dieter. It gets two stars instead of one for offering a few useful staples that you can make up from coconut flour, but the fact that the cover is pitching the fact that coconut flour is low-carb is very misleading; the implication is that the recipes will follow suit, and they simply don't.Not recommended at all to anyone who's looking for this as a low-carb diet add-on."
2,Hopeful - but first recipe was awful,"This is the first review I have ever posted on Amazon but I felt I needed to because I was so hopeful that this book would be a great solution to enjoying things like brownies and breads on a gluten free/low carb diet. I have only made one recipe so far - the brownies. First, they are not low carb. I substituted the 1 cup of sugar with the correct measurement of stevia. I followed everything else to the letter. The brownies turned out so dry and tasteless that I felt like I am eating cardboard. The only way to make them remotely edible was to put a scoop of ice cream on top which defeated the entire purpose. Not only did I throw them away, but I threw away 6 organic-free range eggs, 1/3 cup of stevia and 3/4 cup organic coconut flour = expensive for a bad recipe. Since this is the first recipe that I have tried, I will most certainly give a few more a shot. I will re-review if I get better results. Hopeful."
4,Looking forward to cooking with coconut!,"I just got this cookbook in the mail yesterday and i REALLY am looking forward to using. I'm about to embark on Jorge Cruise's Belly Fat Cure, and being the carb/sugar addict that i am...this cookbook looks to be just the ticket to help me still have some of my favorite foods without cheating. Sure, some of the recipes do call for a dozen eggs...but that's if you make a whole cake...most of the muffin and bread recipes call for 3-4, which isn't overwhelming. Overall, the recipes look easy and don't have a lot of crazy and expensive ingredients. I can't wait!"
5,Cooking with Coconut Flour:,My sister and I are looking forward to trying out new and delicious recipes which will be healthy as well as very tasty!! Thank you.
2,Not what I was expecting,"Saw this book and thought that it would be helpful in adding new recipes to my primal eating. Took one glance through it and found that it was not for me. The majority of the recipes had either sugar or corn starch as a main addition. As I am attempting to be grain free (corn and it's derivatives being a grain) this book was not helpful. The savory part of the book did not wow me. So I sent it back. I think this book would be good for those that are gluten free or just want to try something new, but definitely not with the lifestyle that I am striving for."
5,Coconut Flour Book,"I am so happy to have this book. I am gluten intolerant and love to bake. This book has great recipes and explains how to substitute coconut flour in place of wheat and other gluten containing products commonly used in baking. I bought the book and the coconut flour because a friend told me of the health benefits. You have to follow the recipes to be successful with the flour as it is different than other flours. Very delicious. So much better than using rice, bean or potato flours. One thing I would mention is that several of the recipes I've tried have unnecessary salt in them. I suggest you leave it out or reduce."
5,Cooking with Coconut Flour,I've tried the yellow cake recipe and it was delicious. A friend came over and she also loved the cake. Thanks for all the wonderful recipes. I can't wait to try some of the other recipes this holiday season!
2,better recipies on the web,better and more recipies on the web. was not worth the price for me.what else can i say save your money
4,coconut flour recipe book,A good start to learning about coconut flour baking and cooking. Product arrived as promised. Good purchase.
4,A first person insight into the Panzer branch of Germany,"Excellent book. Once you adjust to the author's meandering way of describing his work you will find a very insightful account of the inner workings of the Panzer arm of the German Army.Guderian is rightfully known as the force behind the armoured forces of the Third Riech and this work clearly is an important account of the behind the scenes action. The personal accounts of his arguments with Hitler and of the Eastern Front are excellent, once you take into account his slightly biased viewpoint.I highly recommend this book as the in depth look at the Panzer arm, but be prepared for a somewhat circuitous path and somewhat hard to read maps. Some excellent photos , but a book written for the military historian and not the everyday reader.Daniel Arsenault, BA History and Foreign Diplomacy Worcester State COllege 1996, Phi Alpha Theta 1993"
5,A great book by a fearless soldier of WWII,"This is a great book by a brilliant strategist and soldier of WWII. Guderian tells his military life with straight forward bluntness that is typical of General's who have seen the face of war and combat first hand. His tactics of ""Achtung Panzer!"" and of defeating and defending against the Soviet Army during WWII is rivoting. A loyal soldier to Germany Guderian makes no apology for fighting for the ""Fatherland"" yet you can tell that he was no ""loyal Nazi"" either. He was just a soldier doing his duty as he saw best. But overall this is the type of General and Panzer leader that the allies feared, especially the Soviets. As a final comment, it would of been very interesting to see how the allies would of done at Normandy, if Guderian was there and if he would of had full authority to let the tanks and Panzergrenadiers loose at the allies after DDay. The allies are indeed fortunate they never had to go against Guderian or the soldiers under his command."
5,GREAT!,I first started to read this book for a report I was doing on the development of Panzer forces. As I read more and more the better it got! I couldn't stop. I talks about everything! Even how they would put flowers on the tanks when they went to a friendly country before war broke out. It's a great book for anyone wanting to learn more about WWII.
5,Brilliant...A classic of war history...,"The book has its most important parts in its last chapters, the ones that review the people of the highest ranks in the WW2. within the book you just really begin to find out how Hitler lost his war...the trait by his staff, noone caring about the youth on the front together with Hitler...you will see how a General can be the ""father"" of his soldiers and stand against a ""Dictator"" for his ""children""...and did you know that at th first times of Germans entering Russia, they were greeted by ""butter, eggs and bread in a dish"" by Soviet people...read to find out how this behaviour turned into a ""partisan putsch""..."
3,Textbook style...,"This is a very detailed account of General Guderian's life. It is well written, and I would consider it to be more of an historical work, than something one would read for entertainment. Validates one's preconceived notions of the German mind.Doug"
3,Panzer Leader,"Too many German Units by numbers, Maps(sketches) hard to read. Mayby great for a true student, but for me a little hard to follow."
4,Great Printer,Just purchased this printer to print Quickbooks invoices and it works great. Easy to setup.
4,Strong printer,Good printer with several options for loading different types of paper. We use 6 part forms through it and it has yet to jam or need to be reset. Very happy with this purchase.
3,"Uneven, but fascinating.","Kenji Yoshino is obviously a skilled writer. He is also a sharp thinker: the concepts covered here require a deft hand and skilled thought in order to not come off as a trite ""Be your authentic self"" pep talk. His assessment of human culture's demands on its minorities (at least those he is familiar enough with to speak for) are well put. Certain portions (especially in the early chapters) seem excessivly verbose. However, where the book really comes unglued is the uneasy marriage of personal narrative and political discourse. Both are clearly written by someone passionate and well versed in the subject matter. But the blending of two styles, while sometimes quite successful (and touching), can make this less than an easy read at times. Still, if you're not bothered by the blending (or better yet, if you're intrugued by it) this book has more than a few great ideas to chew on. Flawed or not, this is an intriguing and thought-provoking read."
2,Not Much There,"No offense to Yoshino, but in truth, he doesn't make many actual points. This is a great book if you want to hear about his personal journey, but it's not very enlightening overall."
4,"Great music, unique ecletic style.","Great music, differant from the run-of the mill Christmas Album. Fun, exciting lyrics, a great value."
5,Collectors item indeed,This is more of a collectors item but my Pirates of the Carribean obsessed 3 1/2 year old still loves it.
3,What a selection...,This is a collection of 4 films:Rumble in Hong-Kong:it sucks/ Drunken Master:Good Movie/ Snake fist fighter:Good/ Fantasy mission force:not that goodDon't buy it.
1,absolutely awful,"avoid this set like the plague. although the films themselves are rather good(especially drunken master), the quality of the video is awful. granted, the quality of most older HK films aren't great, due to the deterioration of the film, but this set was recorded in EP mode. Also, the movies are subtitled, but because of bad translation, you can't see the english subtitles most of the time, only the top half of the mandarin. however, keep in mind that the movies themselves are good, and well worth 20 individually(provided that they're not recorded like this)."
3,Ok if there is nothing else you want to see,This film is from the point of view of the zombies. Interesting concept. I will keep it in mind next time a zombie tries to attack me.
5,Funny Movie!,"At first I had second thoughts on watching this but now, after watching, I am Glad I watched it!! It was REALLY Funny!! Stupid and cheesy and really funny!!! Watch this movie!"
1,Horrific,"This was an awful movie - so bad it's not worth trying to critique. I do feel sorry for the actors who had to contend with a nonsensical script, but if nothing else it bulked up their resumes, and perhaps led to better gigs."
4,Don't judge by the cover! Zombie fan must have!,"Zombie movie from a Zombie point of view. 4 friends are unwittingly contaminated. They have no idea how they really look. To them, everyone else moves too fast and their speech sounds like flies. In truth, they have slowed way down.The film flips from zombie to human perspective throughout. You have not lived until you see a zombie trying to pass himself off as a waiter in a Mexican restaurant."
4,Funny! not your standard zombie movie,This is quite a funny movie and had me laughing thought. But if you are a fan of more traditional zombie movies this may not be for you. There really isn't the traditional zombie action as the characters don't really know they are zombies for the most part so do some accidental killing. The zombie makeup is campy (but funny) and the scenes in the movie where you can see them as zombies are in B&W; and the scenes where it's from their perspective are in color and it switches back and forth.I would recommend it. I rented it and intend to buy it.This movie cannot be compared to Shaun or Zombie land as it's completely different in effects and delivery.
3,"ok movie, not impressed","the four main actors were good, the army guy lousy acting, storyline ok, not as funny as i would have hoped, a new spin on zombie movies for sure, movie well made, make-up good, just didn't float my boat much, the best part for me was the music video, barricade, i bought the song for i liked it, i could have lived without seeing this movie, but will probably watch it again just to see if my opinion changes or not..."
4,"mocking the ""Two Sides to Every Story"" defense","Nahtzees are people too or I was just following Hirohito's orders! Was that so wrong, was that so terrible? You're just as bad as I am, John Basilone!"
3,Nope-Nope-NOPE,"Cute little film idea, and a cute funny film that was not bad - but no where near as ""zombified"" as the cover art suggests (allthough you do see this make up in the film). Not really sorry at all that I purchased it, but then I like campy cult-classic stuff. I say ""nope"" to point to the fact that this is not as funny as S.O.T.D. stuff or FIDO, so adjust your sights on comedy from a diff' angle. I'd rent or, search the web and youTube for film clips and watch them before buying. Just not a zombie film for most zombie film freaks if you like to focus on the more classing zombie action and such."
2,Just not that funny,"I was very disappointed after viewing this movie.From the comments on here I was lead to believe that this was a pretty decent little film.Just not true at all.Very little action,not that funny,and actually boring. The special effects were bad.This could have been a really good idea but it just really fell short."
1,UGLY NOISE!!!,"How can one appreciate this type of ""music""? Neo-classical it is called? Humans created music to express all kinds of feelings, or to paint a landscape with soothing, positively exiting or relaxing sound! How can one enjoy this irritating noise, that will keep him on the edge of his seat? That will eventually turn him into a nervous wreck! Do we even dare compare this ""music"" to the works of Dvorak, Tchaikovsky, Sibelius, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Brahms, and Saint-Saens to name a few? How can one enjoy this broo-haha when he is used to REAL classical music? Adaptation? Open mind? Brain washing? Double personality? Cotton in ears? It's enough that we have to hear this noise on TV and at the movies. ZERO stars."
5,A treat for fans of both Shakespeare and Troma,"Tromeo and Juliet is a wonderfully silly piece of camp in the traditional Troma style and simontaniously a marvolus interpretation of Romeo and Juliet. It is a movie, which defies traditional views of how Shakespeare should be treated, as well as the traditional taboos and values of society, while retaining a respect for the classic play. This movie also has some superbly acted scenes, that when mixed with the cheesy violence and affects are quite charming in an oximoronic way. Tromeo and Juliet is a definite must see for fans of both Shakespeare and trash cinema."
3,"A 5 for sickos, but the 3 stars, for anyone with taste; high","(Nervous cough) THis was my first Troma experience, and I'm very eager to buy more of their dvd's asap. As is the troma tradition, the acting isn't very convincing (although I loved Capulet, Murray, & Sammy)and the script is obviously lame at times (sometimes frequently) but the main goal is just to have a low-taste bash while watching. THere's graphic sex and violence, as Shakespeare intended, but perhaps not to these extents. The violence isn't say, convince on the level of saving private ryan, but that makes it all the more fun. As long as you watch this film with no illusions that it will be a life changing, tear-jerking piece of cinematic treasure, you should have a ball watching. As a plus to the movie itself, the bundle of special features doesn't have a bore in the lot."
5,Funny,"This movie is for anyone who likes the Troma movies such as The Toxic Avenger. Filled with violence, sex, and of course from a Troma movie a lot of funny scenes. A great representation of the tale of Romeo and Juliet."
1,I like Troma movies... but this...,"This movie was absolutely horrid. It was one of the least funny ""comedies"" I have seen, one of the least clever parodies I have seen, and the most forcedly ""shocking"" movie I have seen. If you want to see a good Troma movie, see Sgt. Kabukiman. If you want to see a good satire, see a Trey Parker movie. You should watch this one only if you enjoy being incredibly bored."
1,TRASH! One of the worst films ever made.,"Unless you like Troma (and I can't see how), you will absolutely abhor this piece of.... Sh$t.Bad acting, Bad Humor, VERY Bad Movie. DO NOT SEE THIS!!!What's even worse, I go to the same high school as the co-writer of this trash."
4,One of Troma's best!,"First off, I love Troma movies. Everyone should. But the trouble with most Troma films, is that they get slow and boring in parts and are never honestly entertaining as a whole. This is true.But like a few other Troma films, such as The Toxic Avenger, Citizen Toxie, and Terror Firmer, this movie, while lacking in any real quality film making, keeps you entertained through out the entire thing.It's very creative twist on the tale of Romeo and Juliet, that only Troma could possibly pull off. It's got comedic gore, sleaze and a black man with gas. What more could one want in a film?"
3,Translating Shakespeare into Surrounding?,"A parody on a Shakespeare work peppered with sex, delusions and perversion which, one could suggest, according to creators are very helpful to transfer (and comprehend) this classic story in Brooklyn, N.Y.C.Actors look quite funny while kicked, punched and murdered each other.For lovers of dirty tricks and nice bodies."
2,"1 star for pac's dope lyrics, 1 star for the last 4 tracks..","Some of Pac's best lyrics ever heard. Too bad the beats were wrong.This is the best EMINEM album though, cause 2pac is rapping over his beats instead of him!I hope Afeni learns a lesson. Sure Em worked for free. But the saying goes: you get what you payed for!That lady is rich and can surely afford more qualified producers.The last 4 tracks prove that anyone but Eminem could have done a better job in representing 2pac's work.This is up there with Death Row's crummy NU-MIXX Pac cd!Nice try Eminem, but you can't sell Pac's music with your own 8 mile sound.I recommend they redo this whole cd with Pac's favorite producers and keep the last 4 tracks!Producers to consider for the future: Dre, Daz, Shock G, Sir Jinx, Quik, Raphael Saadiq, Scott Storch, Red Spyder, Johnny J, and Fred Wreck...perhaps even RZA"
1,Disappointed!!!,"I was excited when this CD it the streets but when I heard it I wish I would have saved that 14.95 for something else. I was so disappointed. The lyrics from Pac was tight, but to hear them you have to block out those sorry wacked out beats. When Pac lays a hook leave that hook alone. I thought I was buying a Pac CD but what I got was M&M part 2. I wish Tupac's music is released with as little tampering as possible. If additional lyrics is required because the song was unfinished, it should be done by the Outlaws and nobody else."
