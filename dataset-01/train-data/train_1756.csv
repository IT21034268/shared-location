3,Easy Trash,"This is our second iTouchless, the lid on the first one broke after about two years of heavy use and abuse. We will try not to abuse this one as much...(;)).."
5,SIMPLY AWESOME,"Awesome trash can. Now you never have to touch a dirty trash can to throw something out again. It even has buttons to keep the lid open for extended clean up. Down side is that it is top heavy because of the D batteries and you have to fiddle wtih it to put it on flush. Also, you have to let it close on its own or it will stop working. MOST important -- there's a black collar you have to put inside over your trash bag to keep the bag stationary and for the top to rest on. Be very careful not to throw this away with the trash, which is very easy to do."
5,"Good so far, cleaner kitchen area, except expensive","Useful & good so far, just kind of expensive . But I think that it will last long. No trash bag sippery inside trash can any more& no more half full trash bag, no more padding or touching or seeing the trash .... Overall, i love it."
5,Works well,I have only had the trash can one month but it works just like it's supposed to. Liner is easy to remove and replace. It looks nice and makes disposing of trash much easier.
2,Broke after 6 months,I like the overall look and design of the product but my opinion went down veryquickly when the unit began to malfunction.- Opens by itself- Opens and closes continuouslyI'm not amused either when I have to pay freight both ways to get a replacement. What's with a replacement top direct from the company costing almost as much as an entire new unit from Amazon?This company needs to improve itself in two ways: Customer service and quality. Without these two areas in place the company is doomed.Oh yes - I tried cleaning it. I tried taking out the batteries and putting fresh ones in twice.
4,A conversation piece,"I've been using this trash can for over a year now and nearly everyone that uses it comments on it. It does confuse people the first time, but they really think it's cool after they learn how it works. It's nice that I never have to touch the trash can. Sometimes you need to wait a second for it to open, but never longer than that.Pros:- looks good- impressive functionalityCons:- requires batteries"
5,great product,Great product! I bought one last year for my father and this year for me. Makes it cleaner to get rid of trash without having to touch the lid.
2,I hate this thing with a passion,"Sure it is a nifty idea, seems great to not have to touch the trash can and just throw stuff away.In practice however, it malfunctions all the time, it opens slowly and stays open and does whatever it wants.Also taking out the trash is a HUGE PAIN. You actually have to get INTO THE TRASH and pull out the plastic ring holding the bag. THAT IS GROSS and IDIOTIC DESIGN. Why would i want a touchless trash can and then touch the actual thing that has been sitting there with all this rotting trash and bacteria build up, what person engineered this?this trash can looks nice, i cant think of any other pluses."
5,So handy,"I'm so happy to not have to touch the can lid ever again to open it! The sensor works great and the lid stays open as long as you stand in front of it, allowing you to peel potatoes, etc while the lid stays open. Once it senses you, the lid opens quickly. Requires 4 ""D"" batteries, not included."
4,To trash or not to trash?,"2 years later... I have to come back and change my original rating. About 6 month ago the trash can start acting up, the lid would start closing as soon as it opens. More investigation showed that a spring became rusted and broke. I would expect for manufacturer to use non corrosive metal for such an expensive trash can.Original review: I bought, what I call, ""iTrash"" because the piping under my kitchen sink did not leave me any space to place a regular trash can. So I had to find something with the cover and I love robotic gadgets. I use my ""iTrash"" for a few months now and I like it, it works just fine. The only negative, which I did not find in any reviews when I was reading them prior to buying, is that because it closes so airtight it smells horrible when you open the can. I bought a carbon filter for the trash cans in ""Bath Bad and Beyond"" and it got rid of the smell"
4,check shipment,"love the trash can...worth the $. looks great, came with a couple of dents though, so check the shipment, not noticeable."
3,touchless trash can,"Yes, it automatically opens and closes, but I'm not crazy about the way the tray around the top keeps falling down inside the bag as the weight gets heavier."
5,Hands-Free Germ Free,Just love it......Never thought I would ever think of a trash can as a beautiful addition to our kitchen...but yes...we do...Very pleased.
5,Keeps the dogs out!,"Only had if for about three weeks, but works great and it keeps my puppy out of it. No more garbage to pick up!"
2,Worked ok for a while and then.....,It stopped working....it never opens or closes properly...contact customer support 2 days after warranty ended and they refused to replace.
3,great for one year,"This garbage can was wonderful for one year. I only had to change the batteries once, the opening/closing mechanism started getting a little mixed up at about 9 months, and then the plastic around the open/close sensor peeled off. Next, the plastic around the hinge where it opens and closes started deteriorating until finally the lid broke off. The price was good compared to other electronic garbage cans, but if it only lasts for a year, not worth it. Back to the foot pedal garbage cans..."
1,I should have read the reviews before buying.....,"Our first touchless trash can (from Nine Stars - NOT iTouchless) was SO great I ordered the iTouchless one when the first one died after YEARS of use AND a replaced lid when it didn't work (at no charge to me)after about a year of use. Well, this one died after only about 6 months and I asked about the warranty. They would replace it if I sent the old one in(at my expense) AND paid about $10 for the return (so basically about a third of the total cost of a new one!). I will go back to the old vendor and never deal with iTouchless again. The lid will shut but not open and there are only the two of us in the house and we know how they work and did not abuse it. Nine Stars was the old one so I'm now going back to see if I can get another one from them! I LOVE the touchless but not the iTouchless! :("
1,Should have read the 1-star reviews,"Product claims to use the ""most advanced technology available"" but the automatic sensor feature does not work. Tried both batteries and plug to the wall outlet. Item is warrantied but requires a ""$10 shipping fee"".Order at your own risk."
4,Bought two!,"Really love the size and build on these. Does not feel cheap and it's a great height.I have one issue though- they do NOT make it easy to find the AC adapters for this particular model. The one's amazon sells are NOT the correct ones for this model. When you go to the manufacturer site they don't sell them there either. I sent them an email today so hopefully I will hear back soon.You cannot use rechargeables in these cans so, depending on how often you need to replace the batteries, it would probably be wise to use an adapter. Plus it's a pain to get to the battery compartment.Other than that mine are working great and I have them sitting next to one another (one for recycle, one for trash). Very sturdy cans!I would buy them again, especially at this price."
1,Never buy this product. Stay away from this,Trash can stopped working after few months. Sensor and the buttons not working any more. Lid is under 1 year warranty. When I talked to the customer service they asked me to send the lid at my cost and also asked me to send the money for the shipping which is required to send the repaired lid back to me. Never buy this trash can. It is useless. They are making money by selling cheap product and not giving service also. And the replacement lid price is also high ($40).
5,TOO cool!,"This was purchased for our daughter and her husband to use as a diaper pail. What an ingenious idea - stainless so it will be super clean, hands free - even cleaner!!! The opening mechanism is awesome. Wave your hand over it and zip! it's open! Then it closes by itself after a few seconds.I'm sure it would make an excellent garbage can, too, but to use it for the diapers is just absolute brilliance. And, the diaper pail liner fit like a dream, too.Excellent product!"
3,cool when it works but ours didn't last a year.,"We bought one it pooped out bought another one and one for my Mom they have since pooped out, I tried overstock.com The pin broke off it was 2 weeks past returning called the manufactuer but their server works like their garbage cans THEY DON'T, my next purchase will be a pedal can."
1,poor quality,Didn't even last 5 months. Sensor stopped working. Not worth the price tag. Warranty does not include shipping fees. Better off buying a step trash can. Would not buy one again...at least not this brand.
4,Easy and clean looking,"Works great, lid opens for about 3 - 5 seconds when anything is placed a few inches above the front. Also has open and closed buttons to override auto.Inner ring holds the liner without it sticking outside of the trash can, for a nice clean look. But That can make it tricky to get the liner out it over filled.One point that I didn't like was no option for a power supply, so only works on batteries.Not a lot you can say about a metal tube with a couple of plastic bit stuck on it really."
2,Disappointing,I had had one of these automatic trash cans before but the design seems to have changed. The black ring to use to hold the plastic trash bags inside does not fit as it should. I'm very disappointed.
3,Suitable replacement for foot activated kitchen trashcan,"This trashcan was purchased to replace a manual, foot activated kitchen trashcan that received a lot of use. I was initially thrilled with this purchase as the IR sensor worked quickly and had a good range. As the batteries wear (1 month) the response time is slower and the range weaker which can cause problems if you're rushing to throw something away. The plastic bag holder/insert is somewhat difficult to use and it took some time to become familiar with it. This model provides an on/off switch (helpful if small children or dogs are in the house) and is an overall good value."
4,"so far, so good","I must say it met most of my expectations. The sesnsing distace is quite reasonable (approx 6 inches), latency is good, though it could be improved (1-2 seconds delay), and bag holding ring, though looks suspicios, does the job just fine. The only other suggestion might be to modify the design to keep lid open as long as one is in its vicinity (sometime it takes longer to shake off those pesty food particles off a dish!)"
1,Major disappointment,"We had this trash can in the past and it worked well. However, this time around the product has been a major disappointment. Despite repeatedly waiving your hand above the infrared sensor (in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions), the lid usually will not open. You then have to manually press the ""open"" button, defeating the purpose of buying a ""hands-free"" trash can.Also, when the lid does open, it does not open fully - I would estimate it opens at a 20-30 degree angle. The lid opens fully upright (90 degree angle) only when the ""open"" button is pressed manually.The other problem with this product is that the lid is supposed to remain open when the manual ""open"" button is pushed until the manual ""close"" button is pressed. This does not happen with our product. The lid closes on its own after a few seconds. This is very frustrating when you want the lid to remain open while cooking and cleaning."
5,Can't say how much I love this can!!,"I bought this a couple of months ago because I thought it looked like such a cool gadget and I wanted something that would hold the garbage smells in...well, it is both of those things and more. It's just so handy in the kitchen when you have dirty hands full of stuff that needs to go in. And when I go to pull the bag out, I'm amazed how bad it stinks in there and I wasn't (thank goodness) smelling it in the kitchen. I recommend you buy the Hefty grabber bags...they automatically grab the edges of the can so I don't even worry about attaching it with that elastic thing except for maybe on one corner. I loved it so much I ordered two more in the 7 gallon for the bathrooms. Now there's definitely a room you want touchless and with a lid."
1,Looks great but not functional,"I was really excited when I ordered this as we had just remodeled our kitchen with everything stainless and I had been looking for a stainless steel trashcan with a lid to keep my dogs out of it while at work. It really was nice looking but the batteries were not strong enough to open the lid. It closed fine, but the lid could not open therefore rendering the trashcan useless. Still looking for another trashcan."
4,It's a great kitchen gadget...,It's a great kitchen gadget and works just fine. The only down side is the battery life only last about a week or so. I hard wired the AC adaptor into the unit and haven't had to change a battery since.
4,Great can for the $,"I bought this to replace another stainless can because we kept having problems with the lids. My kids would frequently knock them off their mounting. With this can, noone touches the lid, so that never happens! The lid works flawlessly. The only thing that keeps me from rating this higher is the retainer ring, which makes bag replacement a little incovenient. You must ""unwrap"" the bag from the ring and remove the ring in order to remove a full bag of trash. But it's definitely worth it. I also like the slim line of the can, which helps keep it out of the way. I'd definitely recommend this product, particulary to families."
3,was ok but not durable,"This is my second same kind trash can. compare to other inferared kinds which my mother has (round shape), this one is better and open faster. But it is not durable at all. 10,000 time life is nothing if you use it 15 times a day it last less than 2 years.I like the look although comes expensive spending 60$ every other year!"
4,Good touch-free trash can,We have been using this trashcan for the last couple of months and have been happy with it so far. The sensor is a bit moody as sometimes we have to wave our hand directly in front of it and sometimes it will open when we just walk past it. Putting new trash bags onto the interior ring takes a little effort making sure that the bag is totally covered around the ring. Overall it's been nice not having to touch the trashcan when my hands are full.
4,Works very well,"The product works well with regard to lifting up when you need it. I think the only problem is that it doesn't seal the odors in enough. People come in and say, ""What's that smell?"". The automatic top that opens on command should have a tighter closure mechanism to prevent old food odors from escaping into the air."
2,Just OK for the cost,"Read carefully when purchasing, we are a family of four and my husband didn't read very carefully when he purchased this trash can. We should have gotten a bigger size. We empty the trash daily and on weekends it can be twice a day - I guess we are trashy people! The product is fine, works as it should. There is this goofy ""ring"" that is supposed to keep the bag from falling or conceals it in the can? Whatever it is supposed to do...we find it useless. I doesn't hold the bag in worth a darn and we ended up just putting the bag over the can under the lid, no big deal.**Update** Had to replace this item, it would start opening/closing for no reason, then stopped working all together. We tried new batteries, nothing worked. We would turn it off and on and that would fix it temporarily. We replaced with a foot pedal style can. For what we paid for the other, it should have lasted more than 1 year. I wouldn't buy another one."
5,Best Product on Market,"I bought this as a gift and was told it was the BEST gift they had ever recieved and uses it daily and recommended it to others!! I bought myself one and was so pleased as to how long the batteries lasted and how well it works, a real attention getter for company! Everyone loves it!"
1,Canadians - do not order!,"I thought this would be a novel product to have in my kitchen. I was thrilled when I ordered it. Trash can arrived by UPS and they charged me a $36.82 brokerage fee to bring it into Canada. When I got it home, it did not work. I sent it back UPS and it cost me $73.22 in shipping. Todays Concept gave me a real hassel with the return. I never got my monies back for brokerage fees and the cost to ship it back. I am out over $100.00 on this transaction. Canadians - live and learn."
5,touchless trash can,"We purchased this garbage can to keep our new dog from dunking his head in the garbage can... While the motion sensor is handy I don't know how long this is going to work as the dog is taller than the can now and has noticed he just has to pass his head over the top to open it.However, the device works great as advertised. I love that i can hit the button to open/close the lid if needed."
5,One Neat Piece,"I would recommend this piece.It looks exactly as described in the picture,totally hassle free and the sensor works fine.Couldn't get to feel the deodorizing effect much though.."
4,"Works well, but...","We like it, but the rim that holds the bag in place feels flimsy. We had a 3 Star Auto Stainless Trash container which was similar and lasted 6 years. It did not have the deodorizer that this one has."
2,It is good while it lasts,"Two of these trash cans broke in about one year -in both cases the gear drive which moves the lid broke apart. Let's see how the third one works, because the design looks substantially identical -the manufacturer may have reinforced the weak point.I'm giving it two stars, despite its abysmal reliability, because the design is very neat -we like these trash cans so much that we keep replacing them. If the new one lasts longer it will deserve a better review."
1,I really liked this at first...,"When I first got this trash can, I LOVED IT! But about 3 months in my husband, somehow bumped into it and the lid opening broke. I blamed my clutsy husband, but the lid opening is a little flimsy. Still in love, I bought a new lid from the company, which was about $70 or almost 80% of the cost of a new can. In less than one year, the lid is malfunctioning...it only opens 2 inches unless I press the OPEN button, but what is the point of that? I changed the batteries several times, but that didn't work either. Really disappointed on how much I have spend on this trash can. I wanted to keep on loving it."
2,No good,"We received this trash can as a gift, and it worked at first. Then, we cleaned it. Even though we carefully followed the manufacturer's cleaning instructions, it would open and close by itself, and other times it just wouldn't work at all. It became the most HANDS ON trash can I've ever owned! We have fought with it for 3 years now, and are finally fed up and are ready to buy a new, NON-battery operated trash can. If you want touchless, save yourself the aggravation and buy a step can."
1,"Great product, but doesn't last very long","The lid is great but not built with materials that will last more then 2 years. Customer service only offers to replace the lid at nearly the cost of the whole product. If I knew I would have to replace the product after a couple of years, I would not have purchased it. It was great while it worked, however. Too bad the company did not create an item that would go much of a distance."
1,Worked great for 11 months until it became possessed!,"Length:: 0:12 MinsThis isn't as much a video review as it is just a video of my possessed trash can. It worked great for 11 months and we really liked it. It is pretty sensitive so you didn't want to get close to it unless you wanted it to open but that was no big deal. A couple of weeks ago it suddenly started opening and closing all the time with no one around. I have tried changing the batteries, cleaning the sensor, repositioning it and nothing has helped. I contacted the manufacturer and they sent me a canned response telling me to try the things I already tried. It is still under warranty but based on other people's experiences, it is not worth paying the shipping for another one that most likely won't last either."
1,OK until something happens - Customer Service Blows,"This trashcan worked great for the first 45 day. Then it kept staying open. Got tech support that didn't fix the issue was told to mail it in. After mailing it in on Dec 8th they said that it was take about 2-3 weeks after arrival before mailing it back to me. Well it is now Feb 15, I have called 5 times and spoked w/ angela who keeps saying it is being mailed on this date or that. Oh it's sitting in receiving and will be sent today. Oh were looking into it. And so on. Will i get it back or won't I. Oh and no one will claim to be the supervisor. Go ahead call them yourselves 800-660-7978 you'll see. Isn't it pretty bad when they know 1 of x number of customers by name???"
1,LID SENSOR MALFUNCTION!!,"It worked great for a few weeks. After that I experienced the same problem that many others here have. The lid stays open. When the close button is pressed, the lid closes and opens back again after a second for no reason. And it simply stays open even if there's nothing around it. Changing batteries didn't help. I closed it and shut it off for a day. Then it worked well for an hour or so before malfunctioning again.I'll be calling their customer service and will update this review. If their service sucks this wouldn' be a product worth buying no matter how fancy it is.Some reviews mention about their customer service giving a damn! If I experience that I'll make videos of the malfunctioning trash can and post it on YouTube."
2,Sensitive sensor solution,"Not sure if anyone else has posted this solution, all you have to do is cover part of the sensor with black electric tape, the more you cover the closer your hand needs to be for the lid to open. Overall a great trash can, only negative besides the overly sensitive sensor is the stainless steel is a bit too thin."
2,Loved it but then became crazy!,"Length:: 0:17 MinsLoved it until it turned crazy on us. We used it for about four months before it started acting weird. Last night it started doing this (watch video). Contacted support and learned that it may be due to moisture. We'll try taking the steps they recommended. If it works properly after that, I'll change my review."
1,This thing is a piece of crap!,"Agree entirely on all bad reviews listed above!We bought the 13-Gallon itouchless trash can in August 2012 and it worked fine for about a month.For some reason the lid stopped working in September. We changed the batteries, used adapter, cleaned the sensor. Nothing worked.So disappointed. Do not buy this trash can!"
4,Next best thing to in-cabinet trash cans,"Good looking trash can, better than the cheap white ones. Does a good job of keeping odors contained. Hides garbage bag from view to preserve its looks. Had it for a month and it is working well. Finally put batteries in and the kids now love throwing stuff away."
1,Defective,"This product worked great for a week or so, then the sensor completely failed. Tried some of the suggestions written by other reviewers with the same problem, but nothing I tried got the sensor to work again. The open and close buttons still worked, but this is a touchless trash can. I really did like it for the week it worked, and probably would give it 4 or 5 stars like many other reviewers if it was still working. However, this is not an inexpensive trash can, and for it to fail so quickly for the main feature I purchased it for, I give it the lowest rating. I sent it back and appreciate Amazon's great return policy. I debated whether or not to order another one as I already had purchased four new D batteries, but didn't feel confident enough that I wouldn't end up with another defective product."
2,Leaks and sensor stopped working 2 months after warranty expired,"I really liked this trash can at first. It worked well and was kind of cool looking. But two very important things keep me from recommending it.The first is it leaks. If the bag leaks, the trash can certainly does not stop liquid from leaking all over the floor. I don't think it's too much to ask of a kitchen trash can for it not to leak.Second is after owning it for 14 months, two months after the warranty expires, the sensor stopped working. I've tried all the fixes in the top review, and no go. Even if it were still under warranty, paying shipping both ways and being without a trash can for weeks doesn't sound too appealing anyway.I guess I'll get a Simplehuman step can like I wanted in the first place, but dang they are pricey."
5,Good quality product with great look,"This is a great looking trash can that works very well. I have had the trash can for a long time (about a year). It still has the same batteries and doesn't show any size of failing. This trash can is not a bullet proof tank, but it is strong enough to hold all the beer bottle you can fit in it. Like any sheet metal product it will bend if you mistreat it."
4,Almost the perfect trash can,"Of course, everyone thinks you are crazy for purchasing a hands free trash can but my husband and I really liked the idea. Much more sanitary. The trash can arrived in good condition. Easy to operate (once you get the hang of putting in the trash liner which is not really that difficult but you have to make sure the inner ring is in the correct position). Looks clean and neat. Space saving. The reason we didn't give it a 5 star rating is: (1) I couldn't figure out how to give it 4.5 stars; (2) the lid sometimes goes up when you walk close to it (not a real big problem for us but if you had a large family it might); and (3) it would have been really good to have the choice of an adapter so that it could be plugged in. Not real draw backs and none of these have really been a problem but items worth noting. I would order again and have recommended to friends (even those who laughed). My husband and I both love it!"
4,"Looks good, but a little buggy","It looks much more handsome in person than it does in the photos. It took a few tries to get used to threading trash bags over the fitting ring. It's not too bad though. The ring seems to help with the overall seal; odors are contained within the can. The kids like it too: ""Daddy, the robot trash can, it likes trash like Oscar does."""
5,Very satsfied,Good capacity and nice look in the kitchen! I didn't have any problem with the sensor which works really well.
1,not lasting sensor mechanism,"After 18 months the lid's sensor mechanism broke, it keeps opening and closing for no apparent reason, had to take the batteries out and now must use manual lid opening. The company warranty only lasts for a year, they offered that I purchase a new lid costs $40 + 10$ in shipping charges! Very unhappy, as I already spent over $80 on the original trash can."
3,Don't place near high traffic areas,"Even before buying it, I had suspected that the lid would pop up when walking by the touchless trash can. It does. The placement of my broken, step-on can had been right outside my very small bathroom's door. When I put the touchless can there, the lid would pop open everytime someone needed to use the facilities. I subsequently moved the can to another location, even though I really don't like it there. When this one breaks, I'll be going back to the step-on variety so I can put it back where I want it."
1,Good concept. Faulty execution. Hate it.,"We've owned this (two of them) for over a year now and are frustrate to no end. They never open instantly, so you're standing there for a count of 2-3 seconds waiting with whatever you want to throw out as if frozen in time. Then they close rather precipitously ... just as you're in the midst of the motion of tossing in food scraps, etc. Had we known, we'd never have bought them. We bought one for trash and one for recycling. They work the same and frustrate equally. Never up when you want, never stays up as long as you want, and often close in the middle of your action."
5,Great trash can!,"I was shopping for a 13-gallon stainless steel trash can, but I couldn't believe how expensive they were! This was a fantastic deal on Amazon PLUS got free shipping. Received it fairly quickly, too. Have had for a couple years now and still love it. Definitely recommend!!"
1,dissapointed,We had the prior model....so I was all about replacing it when the pin broke in the hinge on the first model. We had this model less then a month and the seal on the outside on the bottom broke. I realize you can get a lemon with anything- but we are gentle with the lid....this should never have happened. Going to contact the company...
5,Must-Have trash can,"We love our new iTouchless Stainless-Steel Hands Free 13 Gallon Infrared Automatic Trash Can! It is attractive to have sitting in the kitchen and extremely convenient when it opens up for you and your hands are full. It has a ""smart retainer ring"" inside that holds the trash bag in place which is convenient and easy to use."
1,Do Not Buy this Product,Long story short: We bought this can in August of this year. It's November (3 months !) and lid already failed. It's not closing all the way.Customer service suggested to ship lid to service center in California. This would make sense if I was living in California but to ship it from New Jersey to California it's ridiculous.Bottom line: read reviews before buying anything.
5,Works great,Love this trash can! Have had it about a month now and it works great. My husband was skeptical and didn't understand my excitement until it arrived and he began using it. And the kids now love throwing their trash away!*Amazon had the best price when searching the internet and shipped it very quickly.
4,Excellent,I'm very happy with my purchase of this trash can I was looking for one for a very long time and I'm very satisfy with this product.
5,This Is A Winner!!!!,"The little, well used trash can under the sink finally became a source of frustration. So I decided to bite the bullet and the budget and spring for something fancy.I started shopping and comparing, both online and in stores. This procrastination went on for weeks until I gave in. I must have read and reread the reviews 10 times. Who knew buying a trash can could be like pulling teeth?Well, now I've got my shiny new iTouchless and I am deliriously happy. Of course it's only been a few days but the setup and operation is a thing of joy. I went for the AC Adapter vs batteries (cost effective). If things change and my joy becomes frustration again, expect an update."
4,Works great!,"I get a ton of compliments on this trash can I have had it for at least 2 years now and still works great. The only thing I don't really like is the way the liner has to be installed in the trash can, but just a minor inconvenience. I have heard of some people getting a dented trash can from shipping so make sure to inspect immediately when the item arrives!"
4,Love it!,"I bought this because our kitchen cabinets have no space for a trash can. This fits the bill,looks neat and is fun to use. I love it!"
1,Three Dents on Arrival,"Title says it all, it arrives poorly packaged and with three large dents in it."
1,it died after 1 1/2 years and they won't stand behind it!,It died after the warranty and they won't stand behind it even tho it is now discontinued. Not good for business.
2,Cheap quality high price...,"This trash can just arrived, it is not what I expected, poor finish, cheap plastic, cheap aluminium, boring design - all-in-all not worth the money!"
2,Did not last,It worked well for six months and then it stopped working. Tried replacing the batteries and making sure nothing was impeding the sensor
4,Automatic Trash Can,"I really like this trash can, the only drawback was that the charger was not included. Saw the same product at Wal Mart online, and the charger was included. Good product that really does eliminate odors."
2,Made In China,"I received my new ""iTouchless Deodorizer Touch-Free Sensor Automatic Stainless-Steel Trash Can"" today.The box says ""MADE IN CHINA"".I'm making it my goal to buy American made products only."
5,I growled!,"I growled when my wife said she wanted one of these hands-free trash cans, but she ordered it any way. When it came, I was still growling, until it started working exactly as stated. Now I love it! I will probably be ordering this item for gifts for our children for Christmas (after I convince my wife I'm really serious about it, and not just playing with a new toy). It's really great!"
1,Do Not Buy!,"Worked for a while, but gear under the lid is very fragile and broke. Do not waste your money."
5,touchless trash barrel,This is a great product if you prefer not to have to touch your kitchen trashcan This is the second one we have ordered and highly reccommend it!
5,great i love it,bought one for my home around 2 yrs ago and have just purchased another for my mom this year have had no proplems and love it.
5,Works great so far,"We've had this trash can in our kitchen for a couple of months now and it's working great so far! No glitches, easy to change bags and no mysterious open & closed lids. I will say that when the lid shuts its a tad loud, but that's probably just because I'm trying to be quiet while my newborn naps."
5,Touchless Stainless-Steel Trash Can,Easy to set up. Great to have the touchless feature when you have your hands full of things to throw away.
4,love it!,This product has made my life much easier and cleaner. Even my boyfriend thinks it is cool and seems to be emptying the trash more often ??? Horray! My only complant is not buying a larger size. This 13 gal seems much smaller than my regular trash can. It also looks tiny. A bigger one would have been better. I'm still happy.
4,Surprisingly works well... so far.,"I've always been skeptical about the automatic trash can lids... I've heard many stories from friends and co-workers about how they work great for a while, and then the lid will start to not work properly. So as hesitant as I was to get this trash can, it seems to be working great. I will update this review in the future if for some reason it starts to not work properly though."
3,generally works fine with one catch,"It worked reliably most of the time, however one thing annoys me is that sometimes the lid closed before I finished emptying my dirty dishes which in turn made quite a mess.I would hope it has some kind of mechanism to visually indicate whether it detects my hand or not, this can simply be done by showing a different color on the LED, or use another LED."
4,Would definitely buy again!,"LOVE the ability to open it without using hands messy from cooking; bag holder is a little clumsy to use, but it DOES keep the bag out of sight. Would definitely buy again!"
1,Tried twice - got approx 5 months life out of each,That's it - I'm switching to the pedal operated trash can. We got this twice and each time the automatic opener died after approx. 5 months of use. I guess that's about $10 per month for using this thing? Also while it was working I didn't like the response times of the opener but that may just be me.NOT recommended.
2,Sensor not working just after a month,"The product was great and it worked quietly for the first 3-4 weeks. Now even with new batteries, the sensor is not working. Not sure the reliabiltiy of this product."
2,have had a problem with this from 2nd week on,"The top comes up and wont go down....changed batteries twice now thinking that was the indicator for battery change. Now we have to push a button to get it open and manually push it back down....better to have a non possessed trashcan, the old fashioned kind.this is a purchase i regret...."
2,slightly possessed,"I was a sucker for the automatic lid, and although I don't hate the can, in hindsight the manual foot pedal trash can would have been a better buy if you're looking for ""hands free"". The problem with the automatic lid seems to be when the trash gets full, I think the sensor mistakes trash as your hand. I was sitting in my living room last night and I could hear the thing opening and closing over and over again. While somewhat comical, it started to drive me nuts. And sometimes the lid just stays open. It's like I come home and it's hungry for more trash. The can looks nice, but it's somewhat of a novelty item and somewhat aggravating."
1,Not durable. Sub-par customer service.,"Got this trash can and used for less than a year before it broke. The lid started staying open no matter what you do. Finally gave up and contacted the manufacturer. They made me leave the lid unit unpowered for day and reset it at night for three nights before discussing any further options. Then, the verdict was, I would have to (1) ship the lid back on my dime, and (2) pay the shipping fee for the replacement lid. Right. Not going to buy stuff from your company ever again."
2,"Decent, but lacking basic supplies","Works fine, but not designed for all 13 gallon trash bags. Furthermore, I was more than a little surprised when the package came without an AC adapter. Those things cost 20 cents to make, and for a $63 dollar trash can, one should have come standard."
2,Lasted about 4 months,"Well, it was great for the first 3 or 4 months. Then the door started opening slower and stopped at about half way. Now-a-days, the door only opens 1/3 of the way. When this first started, my first thought was to change the batteries. When that didn't work, I thought it was due to the batteries being old. So I went and bought new D size batteries. They weren't the cheap dollar store batteries. I bought Energizer batteries just to make sure that they would be full power. Sadly, this has not worked either.So 5 months ago, this trash can was a 5 star. Now it is a 2 star. Unfortunately I expect products to last at least a year before I replace them. This was a waste of money for the trash can (55 dollars) and batteries (12 dollars).The next one I'm going to buy will be a step trash can."
3,Not worth the money,"I have purchased 2 of these trashcans. They each only lasted one year. The buttons on the front to manually open and close it, crack after just a few months. The trashcan often had a ""mind of it's own"" and would randomly open and close at will. The sensor was sensitive when you walked by but when you had your hands right in front of it, it would often not open. The lid is very difficult to clean, you cannot remove the top from the lid and crumbs and dust build up in the back. Even sweeping it out often did not clean it thoroughly. For the money, I would expect it to last a LOT longer!I have purchased a simple human transhcan and love it!"
5,We've had ours for five years and love it!,"We bought our can five years ago at Costco and STILL love it!I especially love the ring that fits inside so you don't see the bag. It's fabulously easy to use. Even my husband does it correctly, and he's not incredibly invested in making our home beautiful.We use rechargeable batteries and I can count the number of times I've had to recharge and replace them, the can uses so little power. The times we have left something sticking out and hovering over the sensor keeping it open have been exceptions.It somehow even works in the dark.It scares the tar out of passing toddlers, and even some adults, which is hi-lar-i-ous. Despite that, it definitely isn't over sensitive. It's right in the middle of our lives, between the kitchen and dining area, and never opens accidently.If it ever dies I'll likely buy another one."
2,not2pleased,"I previously owned an automatic trash can and loved it. Unfortunately it was broken in a move. I haved looked everywhere for a new one and decided to try Amazon.com I did find them, and tried to get the same kind but got as close as possible. I was at first very pleased with the product, but within a few days, the rim kept falling inside the can, the batteries kept falling out because the battery cover was not secure. Ended up exchanging the whole can to try it again. I feel this could be a excellent product if the battery compartment were on the back of the lid inside of underneath. Thats the way my previous trash can was made."
5,Most excellent trash can,"I've looking around a trash can to replace my old plastic lift top one that I'm always having to wash due to sticky hands and came across this one. Not only is it much more sanitary, everybody who uses it is thinking that this can is the ""most excellent"" kitchen appliance they've seen and want to get one too. I have also purchased a little one for my bathroom. I would highly recommend this anyone who doesn't like having to constantly scrub the goop off of the trash can, or are concerned with germs."
5,A real time saver!,This is the second trash can I have ordered from Amazon! Not because there is anything wrong with the first but because every Mom who sees it wants one too!You do not realize how many times you stand at a garbage can and open and close it until you use this beauty. Such a little thing like automatically closing itself saves so much time in the course of being in the kitchen you will wonder how you ever got along without it. I highly recommend the extra cost of this purchase as being well worth it!
4,Still working,"I bought this trash can way back in 2005. I thought the sensor has stopped working in June 2009, when the lid won't open, despite putting new batteries on. We were ready to buy another one, when the following day, it started working again. Until now, its still working and I really like the sleek, contemporary design of it. For the length of years it has been in my home, I am greatly pleased with it and would recommend this product to others."
2,Not really worth it.,The sensor is really sensitive and sometimes opens and closes on its own. Save your money and get one that has a foot pedal.
2,Under countertop no good,"If placed under a countertop, top goes up and down automatically without swiping hand over it."
2,Problems,"I was not as impressed as I thought I would be. The lid doesn't stay open long enough for some things, the ring to hold the bag in has confused 2 out of 3 people in my house, the stainless steel part could dent it is not very durable. The lid weigh's a lot also."
1,JUNK,"I GAVE THIS TRASH CAN TO MY DAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS.TOOK IT OUT OF BOX, PUT IN BATTERIES. WOULD NOT OPEN. CHECKED LID. LID WAS BROKEN, EACH SECTION WOULD NOT HOOK TOGETHER, LITTLE HOOKS WERE BROKEN OFF. IT LOOKED LIKE SOMEONE HAD RETURNED IT AND THEY SENT IT BACK OUT WITHOUT REPAINING IT.ONE WORD DISCRIPTION, JUNK.THIS IS A BAD REFLECTION ON AMAZION. THIS IS THE FIRST THING I HAD TO RETURN BECAUSE OF CONDITION RECEIVED.AMAZON DESERVES BETTER PRODUCTS BEING SENT OUT IN THEIR NAME."
3,needs a liner,"I ordered this garbage can and returned it because it did not have a liner. Although it is a bit small for the kitchen, I had liked the features so I gave it a try. I had purchased another type of stainless can in the past and loved it because the liner was removable and easy to clean. With 3 children in my busy house, I did not feel it would stand up to our family. At that price I couldn't see keeping it."
5,We love it,"Does exactly what it is supposed to. It opens automatically with batteries or with the adaptor. We chose to use the adaptor so we don't have to worry about the batteries wearing out. Only thing ... it's a little bit disconcerting when after a few seconds, the lid lowers itself. But you get used to that. You can turn off the automatic lift function if you want."
2,Dissapointed,"Found it to be very flimsy. I received it already dented. Returned it, a store in my area had them on sale for the same price, so I went to look & buy one, That is when I realized how thin the walls of the can were. Needless to say I didn't buy another one. I don't think they are worth the money."
2,a little confusing,"this is a fine trash can, very nice aestheically and good for the price, but a little complicated to put together and get working. too labor intensive for just a trash can."
4,if u want something different,Then this trash can might be for u. It works like they claim but mine requires your hand to be about 2 inches away. This causes the lid to hit ur hand when it opens. Overall we are happy with the purchase.....
1,Horrible,"This item worked great. I was a little hesitant to purchase it because if the price, but it ended up being exactly what I wanted. Four weeks later, it was totally worthless. It just completely stopped working. I tried everything. I tried cleaning it. Nothing. If I am going to spend that amount of money, I would prefer it to work longer than a month. Save your money!"
5,New incentive!,"I cannot live without this garbage can! My grandson's like to help it close so have broken two cans. New deal: they will give me the new purchase price from their toy money. So far, that has their attention!"
1,"Pain in the neck, it has been replaced.","I had this can, it was just a nightmare to remove the bag full of trash, it has sharp edges everywhere that shred the bag.Along with that the auto lid lasted maybe 6 months before starting to fail to open and eventually would not power up, even though we used the expensive power pack (ordered separately of course).Finally, since it is motion powered rather than heat sensing, everytime you walk by the trash your hand inevitably brushes near enough to open the lid."
1,Garbage can lid does not work,"The garbage can is very nice looking but the lid stops working after a while. I bought the round can and the lid stopped working right around the end of 1 year. I called itouchless and they send me a replacement lid which cost as much as the garbage can with shipping, The new lid has stopped working as soon as 1 year was up. If you want to spend $50 every year for a garbage can you can buy one of these. The customer service will not help you any way .. all they want is for you to buy another product from them."
4,Nice Trash Can,"I really like the trash can. The only thing is, which I think is a good and a bad thing, when you go up to it so it can open, you have to almost push the button to open it before it opens."
3,touchless trashcan,it's shorter than I expected. I have another touchless can--simple human is the brand I think--& supposedly they're both 13 gallon but this one is shorter & same width. but the good thing about it being shorter is that now the kitchen bags actually FIT the trashcan. The previous auto can I owned was taller & I could never find kitchen trashbags to fit it properly.
5,Love our ITouchless Hands-Free Trash can!,"This is our second ITouchless Stainless-Steel Hand-Free 13-Gallon Infrared Automatic trash can. It is so convenient, and it keeps us free from germs that might be on the can. Besides this health advantage,it saves time because I do not have to wash my hands before or after opening the can. My first can got stuck once and someone in my family forced it closed. Unfortunately this broke the top. After a week or two of having to open the can by hand, I ordered a new one. My family has been given clear instructions to not force the top down. One drawback could be the extra sensitive sensor. The top opens when someone walks too near the can or if our dog wags his tail too close! I can't imagine my kitchen without this can."
2,door was not designed well and is prone to crack,I bought this at the local sams club. I used it for a year but noticed a crack develop on the door flap. Eventually the crack gave way and the gear attached to the the door broke apart and got lost in the trash.Now I have trash can that cannot open by itself and my guests have to figure out how to and where to open the trash lid. I called the manufacturer for a replacement door and they came back saying that they never sold their product through Sams club. That was kind of rude as the website for Sams club show the product being sold via their online store and available for delivery only.I will not buy this product due to lack of customer service.US
3,iTouchless Stainless Steel 13 Gallon Trash Can,"Purchased a couple of weeks ago, excited at first then I started having problems with the sensor on the lid.Thinking of sending item back to Amazon."
1,"Won't stay closed, just like others report...","This trashcan worked great for about 6 months and then it randomly opened one day while i was watching TV. I thought my place was haunted for a minute. I went over and closed it, when i woke up the next morning it was opened again. I thought it was the batteries so i replaced those, still have the same problem. Mine doesn't open a few seconds later though, mine will open randomly anywhere between 5 minutes and a day after i close it.This things sucks... Too many 1, 2 and 3 star reviews for this to be worth the purchase."
3,Battery door fell off,"The battery door is on the bottom of the lid. Apparently ours was loose, and gravity did the rest. Being right above the trash, it went to the dumpster with everything else. This can uses ""D"" cells.. They're quite heavy and don't tape very well to the bottom of the lid. Too bad they didn't place the battery door on the top or back!"
2,Good while it lasted.....the hinge broke,I had this for 6 month and was pretty pleased with it. Then the hinge broke making this into an expensive regular open-top trash can. Replacing the top assembly is an expensive option to repair this. I will just pick up a 'normal' foot operated trash can next time.
4,My little friend,"I live in an older house so no built in garbage bag holders. This little beauty is handy and attractive and as long as the batteries are working it is reliable, always opening when I come near with refuse. Despite it's stainless steel bid, which is easy to keep clean, the plastic top is rather fragile. I'm on my third can in three years because if the top falls to the floor the chances are that it will get damaged and not work properly, or at all. Never-the-less, its the best of its kind out there except for some really large ones that take up way too much space. When my current one breaks I will probably get another unless something new and better comes on the market."
4,Trash can,This particular can works very well an d really serves the purpose I purchased it for and the auto opening is a plus.
2,Don't Buy Into 'Cool' Factor,"This product works as promised, but I really wish I hadn't fallen for the appeal of a touchless garbage can. A garbage can with a footstep is the way to go. It reacts immediately, stays open as long as your foot presses the pedal and closes as soon as you take your foot off. With this, you have to deal with the finicky sensor and a garbage can that oftentimes develop a mind of its own. I can't tell you how many times I've been frustrated when standing by the garbage can and having it open and close constantly.Guests are also confused anytime they have to throw something away. Often, they just lift the lid up themselves and disregard the sensor.You're buying a garbage can, not an iPod. Stick to the basics."
2,Not great,"I should have read ALL of the customer reviews before purchasing this can. It is a bit flimsy for the price AND I've only had it for 2 days and the lid is already acting up. As in the other negative reviews the lid opens without anything in front of the sensor and stays open, you have to use the ""close"" button and hope that it stays closed and the ""open"" button if it does stay closed to get it to re-open. The sensor appears to be malfunctioning. Great idea but poor quality. I'm not sure if I'm going to bother shipping it back, I have to see how much the shipping charges will be. Save your money!"
2,"Nice concept, but poor build quality","I received the trash can with several dents on its side, probably due to shipping. After examining the material it was made of, I concluded that the metal was very thin and flimsy. The dents caused the retainer ring to no longer fit properly in the can. I can say that the lid opening mechanism was very smooth and functional, but the poor build quality of the can itself is why I'm returning it."
1,Plastic gear teeth broke making unit unusable....,"Worked great for a few months and then the plastic gear teeth molded into the lid wore down, causing the unit to try to open but fail. I now have a $90 trash can that does nothing. Contacted iTouchless and 2 of their reps refused to acknowledge, instead referring me to a hidden web page on their site where I can order a replacement top for $45! All I need is the top flip lid. It's too bad they skimped on a 75 cent part of the construction process because the whole unit is now failed."
3,Nice But!,"This was my second auto trash can. The last simply quit working. The current new one works great, you can tell the updates to the circuitry as in it opens much quicker by sensor and remains open longer. I'm quite satisfied with the operation. However the condition of the container when it arrived was not what I expected. It was malformed, The ring that holds the trash bag did not fit properly and at times would fall past it's stay located in the can. At the end I had to use my old can with the new lid to make things operational to a level of satisfaction. Unfortunately, we had used the can for several weeks when I decided I had had enough. Otherwise I would have submitted for a replacement. Nice trash can, But if you feel there's a defect, dont wait send it back imeadiately"
2,"Works great, but quality of parts is a problem","I had to replace my first lid because the gear broke. I ordered it from itouchless.com. $45 for a whole new lid is just stupid. Then 3 years later, the springs on the replacement lid broke. I can't order new springs, but I could order a new lid again. I just went to the hardware store, bought some new springs and rigged it so they would work. $4 for springs. I contacted the company, no help there. Why don't they sell replacement parts? I understand that moving parts wear, but they should offer replacements. My next garbage can will not be touchless, because of the cost to replace worn units. Too bad, I like it otherwise."
5,Love it!,"I've had this unit a few months now, and I love it! It looks fantastic in my home with stainless appliances, and it closes pretty tight so it seems to hold in smells pretty well. I purchased this after a year of living with one of those cheap rubber/plastic white cans with the swinging tops - it drove me insane. I'm single, so it takes me a good bit to fill up a trash can, and the old swinging top would let out the worst smells.No complaints at all with this unit, other than you can see the bag - but that might be because I'm an idiot who didn't read the directions, I'm sure theres some way to hide it.Oh, I guess heres a complaint - I now walk up to regular trash cans and wave my hand infront of them WAITING for them to open.. HA!"
4,Works great!,I bought this because I have already gone through 2 step cans where the step contaption broke. I also wanted my 2 year old to be able to throw things away without having to touch the lid.It allows the whole garbage bag to be filled unlike my old step cans.I have no problems with it so far as other users have stated. Bought in beginning of February.
4,trash can,love the trash can. the sensor is not quite as sensitive as i would like it to be. also wish i had purchased a slightly larger model. but odor filter controls odor well. trash bag stays in well because of the clip. overall very satisfied with purchase
5,Gets the job done,"I've had this for a year now and love it. Keeps the odors contained and don't have to worry about my dog getting into it. I love the size,not to big or small. So easy to use....hands free. Once in a while you may have to reset by switching the power button off and on. So many times I have knocked and bumped the lid while being open and thinking that I might of broken it, but it has really held up! I highly recommend."
5,Worth buying,"I've owned this trashcan for a little over two months and still love it! It took time to get used to the touchless feature, but once you get a hang of it, you gotta love it, especially when bringing hands full of scraps to throw away. Try doing it with the trashcan in the closed cabinet under the sink. It seems to be too sensitive sometimes, and opens when I am just walking too close by, but this doesn't bother me at all. The mechanism is quiet, opens and closes properly, you can open it with the ""Open"" button for it to stay open when you are cooking, and need to use it constantly. I finally don't have to worry about the cat getting into it when we are away from home. The only downside of a closed garbage can is that in the heat of summer garbage starts smelling faster, but you can't feel the smell when the can is closed - that carbon filter and tightly closed lid do their job pretty good. Overall - I am very satisfied with this product, and feel it's totally worth the price."
2,Too expensive to only work for a year,"I'm so sick of these fancy, expensive metal things where the crucial mechanism - in this case the hinge that opens the lid - relies on a tiny piece of flimsy plastic that breaks. This is a beautiful trash can that I liked while it worked, but the little plastic hinge broke and now it's garbage. I've had the same problem with pedal cans - the whole can is stainless steel EXCEPT for the part that should be, and that part inevitably breaks and leaves me with a useless piece of junk. Grrrr."
3,Good but can sometimes be faulty,"It's a beautiful trash can although I'm not sure if trash cans should be. I'm using D batteries which were not included and it was working great until, the lid begun to not open fully. It opens to the max position then drops about half way as the motor seems to struggle to maintain the weight of the lid itself, which isn't very heavy since it's just a thin piece of plastic.Overall good buy but I am disappointed with the motor strength being unable to withstand only a couple weeks of use."
3,Works as advertised. Died in two years and a half years.,Worked as advertised. Died in 2 years. (This older unit has only one year warranty). Any debris on the lip of the opening can throw off the balance of the lid making it dysfunctional. Batteries last pretty long. The primary replacement part is the entire lid with motor and battery compartment. This entire top component costs $40 plus freight. Overall it did its job BUT it would be great if I could get one that would last for many years. I would pay extra for that!
1,Worse Trash Bin I have ever had,"This is my first review on amazon since I hate this product so much, I want to spend the time to let others know. First of all, the Lid is really easy to break as you can see with other review. The worse is actually the customer service. When the lid break (it will break eventually), you have to pay for shipping and return shipping and ship them the broken lid, then they will try to fix it and ship it back to you. Sounds ok, but the process will take about a month. I think it took me around 3 weeks. Finally I just got the lid today and realized the replacement is broken out of the box. I am very disappointed."
2,I would pass...,"The picture may look pretty, but the trash can looks much cheaper in person. I ended up returning most of them and keeping one. The hands-free technology is actually quite annoying because of continuous delays. Not to mention it uses D batteries and it goes through them like water... I would pass and choose another trash can."
1,Defective,"I regret having purchased this item. The lid opens on its own and stays open. If I try to close it manually, it opens again. I'm sending it back. Amazon will pay shipping since the product is defective, but I don't have the original packing material, so I have to figure out how I'll send it back. It's all just a big hassle. I recommend getting a manual trashcan."
3,Loyal User but had problems,"I have had this product since 2006. My initial purchase lasted 6 months and when the batteries went dead and I changed them, then it would not work. Customer service send to send it back for a free replacement (less shipping) which I did. Seemed to take forever for the new one to arrive and it worked fine for over a year. Now it's like a ""possessed"" can, opens and closes at will and will not open when you wave your hand in front of it. I'm trying customer service again, since I love this product, but it has been a hassel and NOT a cheap item. I hesitate to purchase any other products from itouchless based on my experience. I can tell you that I purchased another brand for my office and it gets HARD DAILY use and not one problem. iTOUCHLESS needs to do some quality control on their products."
5,Fun in the kitchen,"From Paula Ruthazer:I bought my first itouchless trash can 2 years and 2 months ago for $100. It was great fun.Just as the pins lifting the lid wore out, I checked amazon.com to see if another one was available. It was, and for $60 with free shipping. What a buy! I love it and use it at least 50 times a day. Also, the pin system used to lift the lid was improved to make it it even better.Thank you i touchless, thank you amazon.com."
2,The lid stopped working within 6 months.,"After comparing step cans and prices at Wal-Mart, Kohls, Amazon and eBay, I found this can for $[...] at Costco and went for it. We all loved it, it was so convenient! The infrared sensor was iffy, sometimes it doesn't respond, but I had no problem pushing the open button, which worked fine to me. After 6 months though, the lid won't open either with the open button or the infrared sensor. Fresh batteries notwithstanding, I have to dig my fingernail under the lid to open it. Sure, the close button still works, but shouldn't I expect that my garbage can should outlive my garbage?Thank goodness I bought this at Costco, I can return it for a full refund even after 6 months. I'm going to get a reliable and durable step can and skip the $10 of batteries altogether. Good idea, but unreliable technology makes this a loser in the end."
4,Touchless Stainless Steel Trash Can,"This item is really nice. Works good. Battery life has been great, I have had this product about 1 month and really like it. Now my dog cant eat the trash she is scared if she does open it when the lid comes down and make a noise."
4,I like it,"It fits in the space that I needed it too and looks great. The price is amazing for such a well designed and manufactured can. Most trash cans (automatic or not) cost twice this. So I suggest this.Cons: The sensor is a little sensitive so walking by it will set it off sometimes, but it's more funny than not, you can pretend it is an inanimate object with a personality. ""No Trashy! You just ate!"" Tickles my silly bone."
2,Lid does not close all of the way,"Upon arrival, the lid would not close all of the way. The sensor works great in terms of it opening, but when it goes to close it stops short. I have had to press the ""close"" button manually to get it to close. Sometimes, it will close all of the way after several manual pushes on the top of the lid when it attempts to close on its own. In addition, the ""deodorizer"" part of it is essentially useless. It has not made a difference. I do, however, like the fact that you can push the ""open"" button on it and it will stay open until you press ""close."" This makes it much easier for when you are doing food prep in the kitchen.iTouchless Deodorizer Filtered Infrared Sensor Automatic Touchless Trash Can, 13 Gallon, Stainless-Steel"
4,"Great trash can, but arrived dented -- twice","Ordered this trash can and it arrived with a big and obvious dent in the lower left side. I wasn't even able to hide it due to the fact that it was situated on the very front, visible to all angles. Amazon was fabulous and easy to work with to arrange a replacement. Thank you Amazon! However, the replacement arrived today, also with a dent! But, it's more minor, and less visible so I am just going to keep the darn thing. It can be hidden from view this time, due to it being towards the back and along the side that is against the kitchen counter. I'm disappointed to get a non-perfect item for this kind of money, but I'm tired of waiting and arranging shipments. It'll do. Other than THAT, so far so good. It looks really fabulous in our kitchen, and was a breeze to assemble. The functionality of the sensor is good (so far)..."
2,Lemons?,"I purchased 2, one for recycle and one for regular trash. Only one ever worked even with fresh batteries. After I replaced the batteries the first time, it seems to stop working altogether. I hope I am able to exchange them. Too many people have had good experiences. I suspect I just got faulty product. Happens I suppose."
5,Great product!,Best investment in a trash can I have ever made. Works great and does exactly what is described. Odor is definitely contained with in the canister.
5,Great Product,"Love this trash can, works exactly as stated. Small enough to fit where I want and large inside. Have had no problems to date."
2,unreliable sensor... making it a unreliable product,"Bought it back in Aug 2011, had the first sensor problem after 2 months of use. Sensor couldnt detect anything so the lid wont open automatically, I did everything that I found from the other reviews here but nothing helped. Contacted itouchless and they responded quickly but asked for a $9.95 shipping and handling fee for replacement, and when I decided to ship it back for replacement, the lid started working again.And today, Jan 2012. The lid decide to stop working again... I replaced the battery, clean the sensor, leave the battery out for couple hours... nothing works. The open and close button still functioning as it should but the sensor just wont work.I will wait for another day or 2 and see if it decide to come back alive again..."
3,"Reliable, efficient but a little cheap","This iTouchless Deodorizer Trash Can is adequate. I recently purchased a SimpleHuman semi round trash can forsimplehuman Semi-Round Step Trash Can, Fingerprint-Proof Brushed Stainless Steel, 10-Liter /2.6-Gallonfor the bathroom which I really liked. I would have been happy with a similar larger model by simplehuman but they were like $200. So I went with this Itouchless model. It is convenient but the noise is a little annoying especially the sound of the lid closing. I do like the charcoal deodorizer. Not a bad choice."
4,iTouchless Trash Can Great Buy,"Love this can, easy to install and use. I would highly recommend this item, the only draw back is the external power cord is sold separately."
1,"Great Idea, Poor Worksmanship/Execution","I bought this item just under 2 years ago. It has been giving me trouble the past few months. The sensor got weak and the lid wasn't always opening fully. Sometimes it did open completely, other times it opened partially, and other times not at all. I changed the batteries several times to try to address the problem but to no avail. Today it is completely dead and broken. The batteries are fresh so that is not the issue. This is heading to the trash.The concept is great. However I would expect a $60 trash can to work longer. If you would be satatisifed replacing it after 2 years, by all means go for it. Great idea to not have to open the lid by hand and better than the manual cans that you step on. BUT IMHO, too expensive for it to break after less than 2 years."
3,Mediocre,"This garbage can isn't as great as it's made out to be.The plastic covering the buttons has started to crack after a few month's usage. And the sensor isn't very intuitive; it will often close on your hand while you're emptying something if you're not out in time. While it can be set to stay open, a slightly longer open time would simply do."
4,I'm buying a second one,"This model replaced a cheaper one we got at Costco that broke within a few months. So far so good, it works well and is of higher quality. I've ordered a second for recycling.It is pretty sensitive and opens when you don't want it to (when you walk by) but that's OK with me. It opens reliably when I need it to.In summary, a fair price for a very good device."
5,Great addition to the kitchen !,"I am so pleased with these trash containers. They are very attractive and it holds a lot of trash. Also easy to empty. I think anyone who is not sure about the item, take my word, it's a dream, for your kitchen, especially if your hands are dirty from cooking! This trashcan is the best !!!"
4,trash can,"This is a great product; the only complaint I have is the battery compartment is very tempermental (looses it's batteries into the trash) and have had to resort to taping it shut. Otherwise, it works great and keeps the dog and grandkids out of the trash."
4,awesome,"Works very well, although walking by it causes it to open.Relatively quiet although you can still hear the whirring of the small electrical motor."
5,This is just the best....,"This is the best garbage can ever....the only thing is that we had to replace the top part as a plastic piece had worn out that opens and closes the lid, probably from overuse and that was after 2 years or so...but it was well worth it. I'm about to order another can for recycles. I would recommend this to anyone. We love it!"
4,Love it,"I really love my new ""auto trashcan"" I use it for recycling and it is quite busy and works perfectly."
2,Lasted 3 years,"We paid close to a hundred dollars for this fancy trash can and expected it to last more than 3 years. My parents also have this trash can and it also broke on them. The small gear that opens and closes the lid is made of plastic and it seems it just eventually breaks. I would not recommend this can. Look for a touch free can that has a metal gear, if someone out there is smart enough to make one. It is sad that in our society things are not made to last and are not guaranteed for more than a year."
5,The Chieftains never disappoint.,The title says it all. The Chieftains always come up with music from Ireland that is the Irish spirit. But they can also blend any music in the world with the Irish. This one is strictly Irish in character. Wonderful!
4,The track list is correct for Chieftains 7,"The previous reviewer asserts that the track list he sees is incorrect. Perhaps the listing has been updated, for at the time of this writing the track list I see is correct for Chieftains 7. If one has any doubt about this I suggest checking the discography in the Wikipedia, for instance, or the Chieftains own site at chieftains-dot-com orThe Chieftains 1on this site. Let this remind us all to check our facts before posting them online.I agree with the previous reviewer that the early numbered albums are the most satisfying of the Chieftains' output for the lover of Irish Trad; the first three, in my opinion, being the best of the lot. There can be found on this site the Chieftains' collectionFrom the Beginning: The Chieftains 1 to 4which, taken together, would have to count as the very best ever of their albums."
5,Great for price,bought this to replace when mine cracked. Took some time and patience to install but It is finally on and works great.
1,Broke immediately,"I found this difficult to install, as the instructions were very poor. Since it was an exact replacement, I had taken pictures and was able to find good instructions on line. I installed it, and on the test ride, first time I tried to shift the plastic part snapped in half. I have installed the old one, the same way that I installed the new one, and it works fine. I know it was inexpensive, and I guess I shouldn't have expected too much, but breaking on the first shift was pretty dissappointing."
2,Shimano Altus Mountain Bike Rear Derailleur - Direct Mount - RDM310,"Wow, now they make deraillers out of plastic, even the gears. No wonder why they break when they scratch up against a tree.What bothers me most is that the entire $ 300 Mongoose bike is made virtually useless becuause the small tab that holds the derailler is so prone to bending. If you're going to make a frame out of Aluminum, at least beefen up the weak points.Wow, I miss my 1972 Schwinn Stingray. You couldn't break that bike if you tried."
5,Perfect replacement,got it for my Mongoose mountain bike. perfect replacement. it is better than the one it came with. the quality is much better and it is easier to tune.
5,Michael Crichton has nothing on this up and coming author!,"This suspense-filled novel contains a masterful blend of fiction and real-world imagery that make it difficult to put down from the start. The many twists and turns of the story coupled with vivid descriptions of events will keep you guessing until the end. Yet, the author ties all of the loose ends, except for the ones that will hopefully lead to a sequel, together in a robust conclusion that is truly one to REMEMBER! This book was truly written from the heart and mind instead of as guise for a movie script. If Crichton is master of the Jurassic Age, than this up and coming author is soon-to-be master of the Halocene Age!"
4,Baby Boeings,"This book contains a wealth of colour photographs depicting the two types (Boeing 727 and 737) in many differente operators paints schemes. Robbie Shaw is well know for his series of airliners books. This one mixes the Boeing 727 and 737 , and is well up to his normal standards. Although primarily a picture book , the variation of angles and airlines from the photographs keeps the reader interested, with cutaway drawing of 727-200 Advanced at the end. An unfavorable aspect of this book, is the lack of cutaway drawings of the other types (727-100 and all 737's). Overall , the balance of the book is good, like others Robbie Shaw`s titles."
4,Very Unique,"This debut album from LOTNS is a truly innovative classic. It's different from their very popular sophmore effort, but in a good way.In 1991, Hip Hop was being transformed and the Leaders were a pivotal part of this tranformation. While the production isn't particularly ahead of it's time, the way Busta, Dinco and Charlie B flow is very interesting. Each m.c matches the beat perfectly with their flow, often interupting their humorous lyrics with growls and yells. The school theme is very apparent, especially since all 3 of the members were about 18 when this album dropped.The beats themselves are funky (but not heavy funk like EPMD) and light. You basically get a little bass loop with some upbeat keys over it. Very 90s sounding, simple and to the point.If you're into golden era hip hop, you'll love this.Stand Out Tracks:Case Of The P.T.ASound Of the ZeakersShow Me A HeroSobb StoryPinnochios Theory"
3,"Mostly good, but a few problems","Yes, it's a good schedule. However, the writing is kind of folksy. I tire of his personal examples; doesn't he know anyone else who gardens? More illustrations or photographs would help, too. Overall, it's a good book, but certainly not a comprehensive guide to gardening."
3,Delicious product but made with ingredients from China,I really do like these to snack on however I'm really put off by the fact that this company always imports their ingredients from China. I'm Asian and I just never purchase food products from China. Most Asians don't purchase food from China either. I know these are not made in China however you just never know what type of pesticides and what kind of contaminants are in their soil that inevitable ends up in nuts and fruits used in these products. Just to err on the side of caution I will not be purchasing this product again.
2,diss appointment,what is wrong with mathematics ? photek and house hmm. not very good .why everyone keeps on insisting that photeks first albums were dark and minimalistic .as far as i am concerned they were beautiful and varied experiences in time and the fundamental mathematical principles that surround us all. i am old enough to have listened to house music in the late eighties and early nineties and let me tell you that this music style has been explored thoroughly by very talented musicians and that house music contininues to thrive today in the hands of excellent artists such as armand van helden et al. all im trying to say is that mr. rupert parkes should have sticked to the music genre that he is good at .
5,Uhhh.... wow.,"Be forewarned - if you are a fan of the jazzy, minimalist d'n'b that we have all come to love from Photek, you are in for a big suprise. That having been said, after one gets past the initial shock, this is one heck of an album. Drifting from hard, fast breaks in ""Junk"" to lazy old school house in ""Mine to Give"" to epic trance grooves in the title track, this album shows a diversity of talent that earlier Photek albums only hinted at. It's got something for everyone, but you'll have to have an open mind to dig it all."
1,"Its Photek, but not as you know him","King Rupert, the messiah for many old school Junglists has taken a massive leap away from Drum and Bass towards U.S House and Garage. More suited towards the 'trendy' wine bar set than the dancefloor. Be warned, there are only two D&B tracks on this album. It is intresting to see that photek productions (his label) on vinyl go from strength to strength with many solid relases emerging. Perhaps this is a snub towards the mainstream and his lucrative Sony 5 album deal."
2,Find yourself,"From the very first track i could tell that this was not the Photek I was used to. I liked what I heard, however, until I heard Glamourama. At least in the first two tracks the tight grooves that I fell in love with were there, but here, there was just the same boring four-on-the-floor drumbeat that I hear all too much. The next two songs were worse. Since when has Photek had lyrics? Even through these tracks I could hear some of the original Photek trying to poke through, but all in all, this album was a dissappointment. Change is good, but don't lose track of your roots"
4,It is a nice mix,"You have some strictly Drum N' Bass tracks, there are some ambient tracks as well. I liked this CD. I'm not a big Photek fan, a lot of their stuff sounds like an empty bucket thrown down a flight of stairs, but this CD is very good."
5,Photek Is Doing Great! You People Are Wrong!,"This is the best photek CD ever made! usually I'm not a big photek fan or drum and bass fan for that matter, but this album is superb! You're right, it has some house tracks and it is a new direction for photek, but how can you dis a talented techno artist just for making a great CD?! House music and Big Beat are the best kinds of techno there are and this album inspires me to be a great techno musician also, and follow in his footsteps(I'm currently working on an album with my techno group, The Afrokrackers) This CD is really cool and photeks best, truly getting down to what really matters, good quality music. Listen to Infinity, it is really cool, and Terminus is also excellent. Go Photek!! Peace."
2,this should of been an Aquarius album,"Photek had a article in the Urb one time for the release of Modus Operandi and He said he used other names like studio pressure and Aquarius for stuff that didn't sound like Photek. This Barely sounds like Photek. I also heard he made an album right after modus operandi and it sounded alot like modus operandi. He scrapped it. PHOTEK LISTEN next time do what BIG BUD did on Late Night Blues. He did what he wanted on one disc and he did what he was expected on the other. Especially do it for us kids in the U.S. that can't exactly go to the record store and get your 12""s."
2,huh?,"Photek was the person who got me into drum n bass. He opened up alot of other areas of music I never thought to explore. I understand his need for musical exploration in other areas as well, (not that if he did another drum n bass album I would mind) but this is a little too much. From experimental dark drum n bass to....house? For me anyway, house is to music now as disco was back in the 70's. A huge waste of time and only meant to get rich white people dancing around because it has a simple beat they can relate to. Photek used to be someone known for pushing music into a new direction, but this just seems to go nowhere, fast. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because I like the album cover. Other than that, dont waste your money."
2,"Some good bits, but...","Wow! So very disappointing. I understand and respect an artist's right and need to explore new avenues of expression, and, as a Photek fan I realize that he couldn't go too much farther with the minimalist drum and bass he'd become known for. However, I think this record mostly falls flat. First of, the two old-school house tracks are terrible. Aren't there enough crappy house tracks out there? The rest of the tracks retain elements of Photek's dark and intricate sound, and in my opinion there is about a 50/50 sucess/failure rate. Nothing is as awful as the two house songs, but all in all, i think i'll stick with ""Modus Operandi"" and ""Form and Function."" I'd try to listen to some of this before you run out and buy it, because it's a big step in a different direction, and if you're expecting ""Modus Operandi"", you're going to be disappointed."
5,The future of music as we know it,"Photek's latest work is by far his best. Though I'm a big fan of his more drum 'n bass efforts (Modus Operandi), he has moved into some new areas here. This CD is compelling listening and I can hardly get it out of my player. Rupert Parkes has had a vision of the future and it is inspiring. He has broken down the barriers between drum 'n bass, house and trance music in one fell swoop. ""Terminus"" and ""Mine to Give"" are both sheer genius, though they could hardly be more different. A must buy for those who consider themselves true music enthusiasts. Go for it!"
5,Great Product !,This works very well for my brain. I work with 350 students a day and my brain has to be sharp!
5,Singing Fun for the whole family!,"I bought this for my 3 year old daughter and surprisingly, it has been alot of fun for the adults in our family too. The quality of the picture could be a little bit better but it is still good enough to see our facial expressions and to be silly on TV!! Even cooler is that you can record your crazy singing on the VCR or DVR! It's very cool and the more you play with it the more fun it becomes! I highly recommend the later ROMS that were introduced for it - which are songs that little kids would like more look for Kidz Bop Sing Along Favorites and Animal Favorites. My daugther really got into this toy more when we had these ""kiddie"" songs for her to listen to. Since she doesn't listen to pop music the other Rom Packs weren't quite interesting to her, with the exception of the one that comes with it because it includes the song: Who let the dogs out & she just loves that song!! It's great to capture her singing to these songs on the VCR!"
4,Prophetic view on the future of Christianity,"Shiflett has an eye for the future. In EXODUS he keenly observes that Christian churches are in the midst of a major change. The identity of churches (and individual believers) are less identified as Catholic/Lutheran/Methodist/Presbyterian, and increasingly identified as fundamentalist/evangelical/mainline/liberal. While he does not dwell on these blossoming distinctions, he does call attention to the undisputed fact that the liberal end of the spectrum is in decline and the conservative end is growing. He spends most of his time on the perspectives of people on each side of the divide, reporting on their views of the various churches and why they decide to stay or leave. As the pastor of an evangelical church who was trained in a mainline seminary, I have had first-hand experience of his conclusions. Give it a read - especially the introduction."
2,Randy Beck,"This book contains a good deal of research and information. But, I believe the author did not dig in as deeply to the subject as necessary. The interviews seem to stop when the answers concure with a preconceived conclusion. It's not to say that the author has a point with basic premise, but there was little investigation on the flip side of the arguement. This book scratches the surface of a large issue and tries to make blanket assumptions.If you are looking for fodder to rip into the author's targeted churches, you'll find this a good read. If you want the truth, don't bother."
5,Great for elderly,"My dad, age 90, was having trouble hearing the phone ringer. I installed this for him about 8 months ago, and it works GREAT. Now he always answers his phone. It is plenty loud enough for him to hear, without being obnoxious."
1,Not as loud as I need,I wish this were louder. I sleep through the phone ringing with it. It is right near the bed. But better than nothing. I can hear it when I am awake and in the room. I would say shop around.
4,I can hear you now.,This is very easy to install. I put it in my garage to enable me to hear in my workshop.It does the job but I wish it were louder so I could hear it if I am running any tools.It was worth the money.
4,Great ringer!,My Mom is very hard of hearing -- we attached this item to her bedroom phone and now she can hear the phone ringing which is great! Nice to be able to adjust the ringer volume also -- good product for hard-of-hearing!
2,Ringer just not that loud!!,I purchased this for my mother in law who could not hear the phone ring. The ringer does have a volume control as well as a slider on the side to adjust the tone but it is just not that loud. About as loud as a regular telephone!!!!!!!!! I was looking for loud and just did not get it!
3,Walker Telephone Ringer,"The writeup states ""extra loud ringer"". I was somewhat dissapointed. Many telephone ringers are as load. But, especially during night, the built-in flasher should help. Price was more that reasonable, but had I heard this, I may have researched other ringers before purchasing."
4,Phone ringer amplifier,Did what we purchased it for. Made it possible for a 97 yr. old man to hear his phone ring.
4,No disappointment,"As she is my favorite artist, I always have high expectations for every new CD of hers. She delivers again, this time on the first CD she has ever produced.But no matter who produces it, the end result is inevitably a high-quality CD. This CD is as enjoyable as any of her other efforts, and she's so good at alternately carrying the tune and adding inflections when another person takes over, often the sax player as she's had a few good ones over the years and has Paul Taylor and Gerald Albright on this one."
2,Not Keiko Matsui-bland and piano in background,"I have bought all of her prior albums, and many by her husband Kazu, and have usually been pleased with the distinctive variety of mix with piano and a variety of jazz or new age styles. But while this CD has a cut or two worth listening, most of this could be exchanged blindfolded with a large number of other boring lounge acts. Unfortunately, this album is like the many other ""popular"" jazz artists who tend to all sound alike, akin to the bland Americanized taste of a Mexican meal that is on the menu at almost every chain restaurant in the country. She used to be different, original and....I was listening to this for the first time in my office and someone came by and said ""I thought you didn't like Kenny G."" (I don't!) On many cuts, the main sound is sax, or some other not-her, so if you are looking for a variety of playing, like Wildflower to Dream Walk to others, it is not here."
2,Diminishing Quality Continues,"I really like Keiko Matsui and have paid to see her three times in concert in recent years. However, this album, like the last, ""Walls of Akendora,"" is disappointing. Whereas in past albums Keiko's music had a bigger than life, Eastern sound to it, ""Moyo"" just sounds like any other jazz album. There is nothing outstanding, although ""Old Potch Road,"" for example, is simply annoying. I suppose it is the evolution of an artist; Joni Mitchell evolved through the years, too, until her albums no longer sold to anyone other than the hardcore loyal fans. Keiko seems to be moving in the same direction."
3,Purer piano,"3 1/2While the stilted pacings of a smooth-jazz release do appear now and again throughout these mostly engaging, Latin-leaning, non-threatening cultural fusions, the majority of interplay displays a synergistic integrity previously lacking."
1,Boring,All the tunes sound the same. Three chord stuff starting with A minor or something. Can't believe I was so stupid to buy this CD with a very nice cover.
4,"Nice for Kids, but Not a Baby Signing Video","We borrowed these videos from the library and my older son and I really enjoyed them. I liked the way they didn't ignore the fact that signs can be used in ASL order or English word order. The story was engaging enough. The kids were great.I wouldn't recommend these for a young child or for one with a significant language disability, but they would be nice for an elementary or middle school age child who wants to know more about signing. We didn't purchase them, because we were looking for something for a child with a severe language disability."
3,Depends on what you need,"If you need a hard-core history review, this is NOT the book for you. However, if you'd like more information about what test 10081 of the Praxis II series actually covers, then read this book. Technically, you don't really need to buy a copy if you can get a library to do an interlibrary loan for you since all you need to do is flip through the chapters on what the test covers and make some notes on what you need to review. The best part of the book, though, is the sample test. This one is 117 questions long (the real test is 130). Otherwise, this book is a big list of what to study, not an actual history textbook."
1,How Many Included?,I searched and searched this page and couldn't find anywhere HOW MANY C BATTERIES ARE INCLUDED. ALL it says is 'Bulk Pack'!
5,"Very funny troupe from Aspen, CO","This CD is hilarious, and is a compilation of material from a cult radio show on two local public radio stations in the Aspen, CO area. The skits are often very clever, as in ""10-4 Glubner"", where a senator gives a speech when CB-radio interferes with his speech-feeding earpiece--as seen from the control room. Anyway, I recommend buying this disc so you can hear this local treasure for yourself."
4,Did the job,I Neese this to convert my Plantronics headset to work with my cordless phone. It seems to be good quality and did what I needed it to do with no difficulty
5,Works Fine,"I purchased this to be able to connect to my Uniden handset. Now I can walk around or stand and take calls, without being tethered to the desk. It is a firm fit on the handset, so I don't have to worry about it coming off accidentally."
1,Does Not Work,I purchased three of these and none of them worked properly with my Samsung Intensity. I contacted Plantronics and they said they do not make a connector to 2.5 mm plugs and I am out of luck in using the Plantronic headsets I have with my cell phone.
1,terrible,I have tried this with my polycom phone and polycom headset nothing but static. save yourself the grief and buy the amplifier
1,Disappointing!,"After reading Bernstein's Capital Ideas, a cheerleading book for lognormal finance theory, which gushes over heroes, I had high expectations for Jacobs' criticism Bernstein's viewpoint. But Jacobs' sole argument seems to be that portfolio insurance was a bad idea, and he repeats it too often. Many chapters are simply too repetitive and were written as if they'd been cut and pasted from different badly-written review articles. Even though the book is post-LTCM (post 10/98) most of the book is taken by with attacking of LOR's pre-1987 idea of portfolio insurance, while the far more fascinating and more recent case of LTCM and the near collapse of the global finance system is hardly discussed. I recommend instead ""The Vandal's Crown"" and ""Inventing Money""."
2,Poorly written,"This is a badly written, repetitive and self-serving account, largely, of the foolishness of ""portflio insurance."" That things which are ""just like"" something else may not be so in reality, and that magic fixes in the market (which after all fly in the face of the rational-expectations/efficient-market hypotheses which often are built into the view of the market being relied on) I guess needs to be pointed out regularly, since hope of quick, uninformed, and painless fixes seem to reoccur with each new wave of financial charlatans and the greed they feed on. Jacobs does point out such problems for a particular, rather bizarre episode, and suggests, not too coherently, that such ""scams"" are still prevalent. However, He does this in a horribly repetitive and self-laudatory way that is not really very clearly argued."
1,Cheap imitation don't bother,"Got these, I read the review about fit, but that didn't stop me. Should have but didn't. They do fit on the brush. They do function, for a while. The brush heads wobble, which is not right, but I think when a metal part fell out, it just convinced me, pay the money get a braun as pricey as they are. But don't bother with these,."
1,Don't Buy,"This product does not fit onto your Braun Oral B battery operated toothbrush. When I contacted customer service through email I was advised that if I didn't open the package I could return it for a refund. Well, how could I know if the brushes would fit the my Braun Oral B toothbrush holder unless I did open the package? So be aware, or make sure if you decide to choose the Generic Braun Oral B brushes, believe in your self that it would fit??? I order 2 sets and was only getting credit for 1 package that was not opened. These are cheap brushes from a foreign country, it has some foreign language on the package that is not shown on Amazon's website.Buy the real Braum original toothbrushes for your toothbrush holder. Save your money, you are not getting a deal for the price they offer."
1,not so good,product waste of money where do i start1.case broke after 1st use.2.attatchments hard to put on and take off sometimes just fall out.3.tool adjustments flimsy4.slips all the time many scratches on back of cases5.good if you want ruin your watch.
2,Piece of junk,Totally not worth it. I think I will take my watch to a small shop for a battery replacement . This item it just not open my watch
4,worth the money,"This product worked fine for what I needed. I used it to change out 3 watch batteries, 1 Nautica, and 2 Bulova.One set of fittings wouldn't fit in the tool which is why I gave it 4 stars.One word of caution though, if sctatchs on the back of your watch are unacceptable you might want to look for another tool or use extream care when using this tool, it sliped off the groves a couple times with me."
2,it works- but only after some trouble,"i had to oil up the parts that you can change (the keys) and then bang them in with a hammer- but after this it does work -mass produced china junk - but if you need one at a cheap price ,it does work -opened two watch backs to change batteries with it..."
3,Does the job,"This tool is really badly made, but it opened my watch so I can't complain for the price. The adjustable pin holders wobble a lot as you're using it and I had to use a hammer to get one of the pins into its holder. If your watch back is screwed on tightly (which it probably is) then you'll need something (a vice or dedicated watch holder) to hold the watch in place - unless you have an iron grip and are prepared to risk slicing open your hand with the wrench."
1,very cheap product!!!!!!!!,the bits that come with it to open the case on your watch are extremely cheap. The first time i used it the bits began to break away and crumble. A total waste of money.
2,Poor quality,"Unfortunately the quality of this item is pretty poor. There's so much play in both adjustment mechanisms, I would hesitate using this wrench out of the box since you'll probably end up scratching the back when pins slip out of place. Another reviewer took theirs apart and sanded down the black plastic spacers. I ended up taking mine apart and adding some nylon and steel washers I had handy to tighten things up. Unless you plan on channeling your inner MacGyver to remove the slop or are willing to risk scratching your watch, I'd look elsewhere for a quality case wrench. Good luck."
2,no directions,"cant figure out how to use it, no instructions. It came quickly no problem with my order. hope i can find instructions somewhere."
1,Does not work for my screw back watch,"First, the tool does not work for my watch. Second the quality is questionable. The bits are very soft and seem to want to bend as pressure is applied. The bits also are mis-sized for the tool. They are designed to lock in but they turn out of alignment and then your stuck retrieving the bit from the tool with a pair of pliers. Don't know how the product would work for other screw back models but it does not work on my Swiss Army watch."
3,Works but forget the box,Tool seems to be ok but forget about the box. Either have wood glue on-hand or just order one without. Mine showed up in pieces.
2,Did the job,Recieved tool wasn't sure it would work due to all three points didn't stretch big enough to fit notches in back of watch but got two out of three to fit and got the back off so it did the job
2,Watch back tool,The tool works but it is less than a precise watch. It is functional while being almost crude. I used it and it did work but I will never use it on a good watch.
1,Unusable product.,"At less then $10, my bar was set very low. I figured I'd have to tinker around with it to get it to work properly. There is no amount of tinkering that will make this wrench work. First, the pins appear to have been melted into the plastic holder. Several of them are STUCK in the holder and I can't get them out! Secondly, one of the 3 holes that the pins are stuck in to is defective. So I'm unable to use the tool."
4,Review,"It was a little lower quality than the pictures suggest, but it worked well enough. If you only need this specialized tool occasionally, it's fine. I doubt a professional watch repair technician would be satisfied with it. It's more Buffalo tool than Snap-on Tool...more Harbor Freight than Craftsman."
4,Adjustable SE Watch Case Wrench Adjustable,"If you have an expensive watch, get a professional, otherwise this will do the job for you for all those occasions you need to replace batteries for your watches. Just be sure to snap the bits in the slots. If you don't snap them, you'll think the bits don't fit. Make sure the bits have a firm grasp before turning to open the watch case so that you won't scratch up your watch. It is what I've expected for 10 bucks."
5,"Essential addition for 10,000 Maniacs fans","I discovered this album only after Natalie Merchant had left the original 10,000 Maniacs and I already owned all of their other recordings. For real 10,000 Maniacs fans and Natalie Merchant fans, you will love this collection of Natalie's early work as a young woman. It provides nice insight into their later work, particularly in Natalie's lyrical style. Like their later work, Natalie's voice and lyrics will quickly addict you."
2,Good addition to collection for diehard 10KM fans.,"Hope Chest (1990) is really a collection of songs originally released much earlier. Hope Chest combines the tracks from the 10,000 Maniacs' first two EP's, Human Conflict Number Five (1982) and Secrets of the I Ching (1983). These two EP's, no longer available, were released by the bands' imaginary record label ""Christian Burial Music"".The songs themselves are pretty good, with the best tracks probably being ""Pit Viper"" and ""My Mother the War"". ""My Mother the War"" became the group's first song to get some airplay. Some of the best songs later appeared on the band's first full length album, The Wishing Chair (1985).Although this is probably the weakest album yet released by 10,000 Maniacs, it does make a nice addition to a 10KM fan's record collection. Being able to hear Natalie Merchant in her earliest days as an artist is a treat, and John Lombardo's guitar playing and writing are keenly missed in some of 10KM's later releases."
3,For the Big Fans,"When I bought this CD I was hoping to get some gems that would help me get a greater sense of who the band was in their earlier days. What I got was an average collection of songs that I haven't played since the first time I listened to it.If you are a big fan, go ahead and buy this. If you are a casual fan, who likes what you heard on the radio during the Natalie years, then stick to the other major releases. If you are looking for something new, something unique, then my advice is to look elsewhere."
4,"Not your ""typical"" 10,000 maniacs: a documentary","As someone who had his teen years in the eighties, I was gladly surprised to have heard this album which depicts the first recordings by the band at the beginning of that decade. There's a blend of styles that range from reggae to ska and new wave, that show where Natalie Merchant and company came from. Filled with an innocent flavor that makes it all the more attractive, not your ""typical"" 10,000 Maniacs album, yet an extraordinary documentary on the band's original work."
5,the only one,"""the hope chest"" is the only 10,000 maniacs album that i can fully enjoy as an album. the beautiful spontaneity of natalie's youth is so apparent and shining that after hearing ""the hope chest"" one is ruined for the stenciled drudgery of their subsequent releases. for me, this is the only album in which i can realize, and hear in the music, the passion which this young woman felt for her ideas."
4,Early Maniacs at their best,"This album is great, but admiteddly, it takes an acquired taste to appreciate it. If you are a fan of 10,000 Maniacs or of Natalie Merchant, this album has a lot of good tracks that show off their early prowess as a band. A lot of the songs sound light with little production, but it serves to focus on the groups ability to sound great by themselves. Natalie's early vocals are clearly not as strong as her later work, but she does sound fresh, young, and able to belt it out."
1,Beware,"This is a beautiful piece of cookware. Unfortunately it retains its heat too well, which makes it impossible to transport. The tiny side pieces are way too small to grasp and the bottom is too hot to support. I cannot tell you about the quality of the food prepared because the dish and its contents shattered into many pieces upon transporting it from oven to table when it slipped from my hands. Luckily, I got a fantastic deal on the dish. However I now have no dish and no dessert either. I will buy Pyrex next time, as I find these cheaper baking dishes to be more easy to use and more resilient than Le Creuset."
1,"Volume of pan is 8"" x 8""","Even though this pan is sold as 9"" square, it actually holds only as much as an 8""x8"" square pan due to the thick sides and slanted edges. Your recipes calling for a 9""x9"" pan won't turn out. That extra inch all the way around makes a big difference in baking."
1,Not a .NET programming book,"The title ""Learn to Program with Visual Basic .NET"" is very misleading. The book has no .NET content. I bought the wrong book, if I'd bought it locally then I would have taken it back to the store. As a beginners guide to VB it's OK but only if you are an absolutely beginner and even then only if you like to gather information in the form of a story.Not .NET ...Only for the complete novice"
5,Professor Smiley Got This Beginner Started!,"I started trying to learn my first programming language, VB.NET, with Microsoft's Visual Basic.NET Step By Step and SAMS Teach Yourself Visual Basic.NET. Frustrated with the didactic gaps and presuppositions of prior programming knowledge in these books, I purchased Learn to Program with Visual Basic.NETby John Smiley.Professor Smiley got this beginner started with VB.NET. I have advanced degrees and IT certifications, so I don't consider myself a ""Dummy."" This book took it for granted that I had no programming or VB.NET knowledge and taught me the basics of both. If you are like me, you should benefit from this book. If you're a programmer, I would guess that you should look elsewhere to learn VB.NET."
1,Way to many words,"I found this book to be just too ""cute"". There was too much contrived classroom dialog and character development of the students. That was fine for the first chapter or two but after that it was way to much to wade through. The actual how too's were buried in the student questions and quote marks that made it unusable even as a reference. In the end all that was developed as a sample was a one screen app with a few check boxes. No flow control etc. Not a very realistic sample."
1,Hopeless and Annoying,This book has too much conversation going on that it is easy to miss the point. This book was a total waste of money. I am new to VB.NET and wanted to learn it; not listen to people talking back and forth.
2,confused,"I was confused when I purchased this. I was thinking that it was a complete CD not just two songs. I must not have understood, or I would not have made a $18.00 purchase for two tunes. I feel pretty stupid"
3,One was broken,One of the lamps was broken on arrival. I still saved a considerable amount from what it would have cost at the local hardware store.
4,"OK, but check with company about recall","It worked fine for me, but check with the company because some models have been recalled. They replaced some of mine."
4,Love it!,I received this as a mother's gift. I love it. I like chokers and this was the perfect length. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five was the color is more silver then purple. I still love it!
2,For Dancers Only,"If like me you are looking for an introduction to the wonderful rhythms that are possible from the doumbek, keep looking. As an aspiring doumbek player in search of inspiration, I found the liner notes and musical notation contained there only gave the most superficial outlines of the drumming which, within seconds, becomes embellished to the point where it is no longer recognizable. Unless you enjoy listening to non-stop solo drumming, I would not recommend this CD. I can only imagine that this disk would be useful for practicing middle-eastern dancers in need of a drummer with a pause button. I would, however, recommend R.A. Fish's 'Fish On The Desert' CD as highly listenable on its own thanks to the inclusion of traditional arabic instrumental melody and more instructive for traditional arabic rhythms."
1,"White men can't, eh, play doumbek","The other reviewers have already explained it in sufficient detail: this disc is a total turn-off. Lacks any sort of excitement. It doesn't inspire me to pick up my drum, I fail to see how dancers would be inspired by it, it's repetitive, compared to Arabian drummers I've heard it's fairly unidiomatic, there's nothing of any technical or musical interest. The worst Arabian percussion CD I've heard by far."
4,Loud,I bought this product because it was super cheap used (paid 9.50 total). Its loud and sturdy. What more do you want in a tambourine. Molded plastic.
1,PITIFUL!!!!,It is a shame that Amazon CHANGES item description WITHOUT a proper REVIEW. This item originally was listed as a SINGLE unit! -- Now it is a case of 25!
5,"Scary, realistic, original . . .","The Mosquito War is a remarkable book, with beautifully drawn characters who are far more real than many who show up in today's thrillers. It's also a gripping tale that zips along, becoming more compelling with each chapter. Of course it's loaded with the kind of technical details that make its premise completely plausible -- but they're folded in so well that instead of slowing down the action they merely add another layer. It may have been meant to be escapist fiction, but the depth and timeliness leave a lasting impression. And while it's impossible to read this and not be troubled by the danger of biological attacks, most readers will still enjoy the story for its adventurous suspense, colorful writing and heartfelt terror that pushes its characters toward a stunning, unforgettable conclusion!"
5,Mosquito War,"This book is well written, well researched, has plenty of twists and turns, is fast moving, and an excellent mystery novel. It is obvious that the author has first hand experience with Marine life, research work, and with infectious diseases. It is definitely a great summer reading book."
3,3 1/2 stars,"See storyline above.A fairly solid medical thriller from first time novelist V.A. MacAlister.A virulent strain of malaria, a secret serum, and high level coverups, all move this biological thriller at a steady pace. A well researched and timely novel. The characters didn't strike me as likeable. Maybe because, as the reader, I couldn't relate to them. Dry?Inside the covers:Anopheles...She bears no particular malice toward humankind, does not in fact really seek him out. To the Anopheles, a man is as good as a mouse. She is only seeking a blood meal, and that only for the urgency of motherhood. What could be more simple, more pure?Recommended"
5,THE US ARMY AIR CORP (US AIRFORCE) WILL NEVER RECOVER,Arthur Lubin directs this FUNNY 1941 Abbott & Costello vehicle. Bud and Lou with their stunt pilot friend Dick Foran enlist in the US Army Air Corp (now known as the US Airforce). The best highlight of the film is comdieanne Martha Raye who portrays twin waitress. 5 STARS again to Mr. Lubin and the UNFORGETTABLE Abbott and Costello.
1,Disappointed !,"I bought this book with a lot of hope. But I have to say that I got extremely disappointed after looking at this book !The main problem is the way this book is written. It may be good for research purpose, but not for study purpose. Every sentence in this book is followed by multiple references within parentheses. The whole book seems to be a blueprint before becoming a real handbook ! And the quality of paper ! I don't even want to talk about it ! I returned this thing immediately !"
2,Could be better,Both sections start off with interesting information but then quickly dies into a ponderous 2 hour video that students will not sit through. The narration puts me to sleep. I can only use the first 20 min or so of each section before I need to turn it off.
4,Not what I call sand,"The color looks nothing like the picture. It is yellow and black, maybe greenish yellow in the right light. Also the measurements are off, it is not square, it is 40""x44"". Does function fine and looks great when worn, I just wish the color had been more like the image shown."
1,Boring Textbook,"Out of all my required textbooks in college, this was my least favorite. Perhaps it was the organization of the class as laid out by the professor that made this book so lifeless for me, but I found his supplemental texts more relevant."
5,High quality and easy to install,"Pros - Comes with everything you need to install; omnimount customer service is great if you have any questions; is attractive, durable and high quality; works exactly as manufacturer statesCons - screw sizes are metric so we didn't have the exact size drill bit needed. We opted to just use the closest smaller size and wiggle it around to make the hole slightly larger; labels on parts did not match the parts list but we were able to figure out what was what fairly easilyOverall - I love this mount! Was very easy to install (does require two people) and it looks great. I recommend calling Omnimount prior to purchasing to confirm your mount choice. They can also let you know if any adapters are needed in advance based on the TV you'll be mounting(very nice to know!). Their website is also very informative. We installed this with a 32 -inch samsung flat panel in my office/den and we're very happy with it."
2,"Easy in, easy out....easy reading..","Martell's piece is a good way to kill a few hours on a flight between Vienna and New-York. The lay-out makes you believe you are actualy reading SEAL mission real paperwork. The different missions covered, which lead to the final assignment, are well done, and for the average, weapon-unfamiliar person, rather precise. Not totally accurate, but precise.The drawback comes when by mid-book, the reader has more or less lost track of what the book is all about. Besides, all goes well for these SEAL guys. I doubt real missions go as smoothly as the book's ones; This special ops unit is definitely good at planning, but THAT good makes it slightly too...""Hollywoodesque""!Pictures instead of drawings might have helped as well.Overall, a good reading for anyone having interest in this military, counterterrorism warfare business, and definitely a must-read for the Special Op Wannabee.Does not grant a second burst for everybody else."
2,Action reader,"This Seal novel would be better if the writer had a good plot, missions are good but lack realism, team goes in and then out very little action and the spook is just not real. suggest writer add more story and action for both sides. Seals are not perfect all the time, even if they think they are. these missions are to perfect."
3,Entertaining but be careful.,"Desmond Morris does a wonderful job guessing WHY certain traits are favored by evolution. His work is strictly his observations and should not be taken for scientific fact. He uses parts of fact to establish his entertaining theories. Science answers WHAT, people like Morris theorize WHY."
2,Less than Standard.,"This commentary on the fourth gospel by Malina & Rohrbaugh could by used by the critical reader for some insights into the author's social setting. Yet this method should be allowed only so much of a foothold on a commentary and should not dominate the landscape. Into this trap have Molina & Rohrbaugh fallen into.Moreover, there is virtually no Textual critical questions addressed at all. No interaction with opposing commentaries. Narrative and theology are barely given weight. And finally, the historio-religious method permeates Malina & Rohrbaugh's conclusions time and again.Malina & Rohrbaugh's all to frequent reconstructions are torturous and hard to follow. Somehow it seems that as the commentary progresses verse-by-verse M&R get farther and farther from John's intended meaning.A much better critical read of the fourth gospel remains Herman Ridderbos, or Rudolf Schnackenburg.R.E Aguirre <><"
1,Avoid these,"We have had racks like these in our barn for 17 years. The past 2 years we have noticed our western saddles aren't fitting the horses right, they seem to have spread the trees so they sit down on the withers. So much so the horses backs are sore or they buck. I thought it was an isolated incident when I realized it on one but it has done it to 2 saddles. 2 saddles ruined. They weren't cheap ones either, one was a Circle Y, the other a special hand made one. Saddles need a rack that will support the whole tree a V shape. The concept is good and we liked we could fold them away but not at the expense of needing new saddles. Anyone need a couple saddles for decoration?"
3,it does the job,"I received my, purchase on time and it works just fine. it seems to be working as it suppose to."
4,Kinda kinky,"The price for this item was fair and the shipping was acceptable. The only beef I have is that it is not a very tightly coiled extension. This may be due to its length.All things considered, I am happy with the purchase."
1,Not worth the price,This stacker has nice textures but the sounds can only be activated by an adult. There is only one spot on each ring that make a sound. One is a bird and one is a frog - didn't know those fell into the barnyard animal sounds! My grandson hasn't found it very amusing at all. Definately not worth the almost $40 price tag.
3,just okay,"I ordered this from Amazon's Warehouse for much, muchless than what it retails for here. Had I paid fullprice, it would have gone back, but for the money Ispent, we decided to keep it. There is no base whichmakes it very difficult to thread the first ring on,it won't be possible for our son for some time. Eachring has one section you can press and it makes noise.The head is supposed to giggle when you put it on thetop of the rod, but you have to press down so hard forit to work that it's kinda pointless. It is cute andsoft and as individual rings it works okay for us for now."
2,No sound,Purchased this as a Xmas gift. One on the ring sounds does not work. To much money for this item to be received not in working order. Where is the in house inspection?? Of course the return date is past because I bought it in November. I have learned my lesson. I spent a lot of money with amazon this year so I might think twice about on line purchases and returns with them.
5,My son loves this!!! ...And so do I!!!,This is absolutely adorable!! Worth every penny that I spent on it!! It is just nice fabric and fun textures you can tell the high quality is there. The animal sounds are too cute and my son LOVES hearing them. The head at the top does this little giggle that is just so fitting! Such a great toy!!!
2,Overpriced,"Looks great, but the sound in one of the rings didn't work. It's also hard to pull apart and stack/put back together, i.e. not particularly functional. This is definitely a toy for adults who like zany design, not so much for babies. I was seduced by a lot of the Zolo products, but so far they've all seemed overpriced to me. In the same category, but even better looking and much better designed is the Manhattan Toy Noobu (sp?) stacker. I couldn't find one for sale anymore, but have played with one and they are awesome. Makes a sound when you put the ring on the center pole. So much smarter."
5,She loved it!,"We got this as a gift for our seven-month old granddaughter. She loved it. Her parents also really liked it. The multiple colors, textures, and patterns really appealed to her. And she squealed the first time she figured out how to get the discs to make noise. Definitely a winner!"
4,"Great toy, Fun for children and adults","This toy not only looks cool but is actually fun to play with. The animal sounds are great and my 5 month old loves to play with each ring. A bit pricey, but worth it!"
3,Cute Concept,"This company has lots of toys that are unusual and have great concepts. I love the toy and my daughter seems to like it okay. The rings are stacked on a stick and it may have been more helpful and my daughter may be more interested in it if the stick was free standing and she could just stack the rings on it. But when all the rings are off the stick, it's just a cloth stick and my daughter seems to only be interested in the stick right now. She does try and poke the stick through the center of the rings but hasn't gotten how to push the rings down and stack them. Maybe they should have made not only the stacking stick free standing but the holes a little bigger on the rings so babies can easily stack the rings on. Maybe my daughter will be more interested in the toy later. She's 12 months now."
2,Not interesting enough to finish reading!,"This book was bought for me as a gift, and thereforeI began to read it with an extremely open mind. However, I quickly became uninterested with the book's format. On occasion, the author seems forgetful of the topic at hand, because at times I had no idea what he was trying to say.Overall, I think that the entire contents of this book could be delivered in short essay of some type instead of a 400 page book. I do commend the author for trying so hard to lend his insights into ""the spirituallity of life"" and ""pursuit of knowledge"". However, because of the ""blah"" writing style, I did not want to finish this work although I had high hopes for it when I started it... Some things are better left undone..."
1,buyer beware,"I love the series - it's terrific. I was very excited to see it come out on BLU RAY. THe problem is this blu ray doesn't play on US blu ray players. So unless you have a multi-region player, don't buy this disk."
2,not as good as anticipated,"I was under the impression that the guanabana fruit was similar to the atis fruit, it's not. Close, but no. It's a good juice. I just didn't like it that much."
4,Totaaly Different,I love checking out music form around the world and this brought me something I had not heard before. Definetly glad I got it.
5,Incredible work!,"This is the work of a true People's Scholar. If you ever want to learn about the unspoken, unmentionable power structure of the US and its role in creating the concept of Whiteness and therefore Blackness, you must read this book. Every page is a delight!"
1,pure propaganda.. :(,"Pages and pages of leftist rhetoric, all having one underlying goal: to ""get"" the white race on a technicality. As though european decendants are going to just go ""gee, we don't have any common interests after all."" There were some well made , clear arguments.. but if you are into this stuff just turn on your tv for a while."
1,Don't let facts get in the way of a good story!!,"From Allen's book: 25. Whatever exactly the remonstrants (Irish) meant by their word ""race,"" their grievances, like those of the African-Americans and the American Indians we have cited, bore the hallmark of racial oppression. From the Petition of 1277 to the Remonstrance of 1317, it was specifically the legal status of the free Irish men, rather than the unfree, which was at issue.This is typical ignorance of the genetic differences between the Anglo Saxons and Celts. Scientists have distinguished the domiant Y chromosome of the Irish, Basque and other Celtic peoples from the Anglo Saxon peoples in genetic samples of European populations. Apparently Mr Allen would like to forget about science and lump all white skinned folk into one ""race"". Good for him, enjoy this fairy tale if you like but if you seek an honest study on the differences and difficulties of race, search elsewhere."
4,Reprint of a classic,"This is a reprint of a very good book by John White -- likely to take advantage of the 'Prayer of Jabez' craze. While this book might not have the same popular appeal as 'Jabez', I believe it presents a more balanced perspective on prayer through the study of ten unique prayers in the Bible.Even 10+ years later, the observations and lessons from this book still remain true. If you haven't thought much about prayer and God's interaction with us through prayer, this is a great place to start."
5,The Best Raw HIP HOP DVD out,"I saw a promotional copy of the project. a great piece, all the orignal members speak on the truth of Death Row. This doc has a reality feel but the film makers have great controlled interviews. Snoop is in the doc for about half an hour, a lot docs only have the featured cats in them for a second, not this one. Daz was being Daz, funny and talking junk on Suge and Krupt. I don't want to give it away but a lot people will be surprised at what Tray Dee said about Snoop before he went to jail. Finally a guy on camera talking about how Dr.Dre jacked his beat. For any fans that enjoyed ""Pimps Up Hoes Down"" or ""An American Pimp"" there's is a 20 minute segment with Big Pimpin and Lil Pimpin that is funny and real to the core about pimpin and Hip Hop. Hopefully Daz can continue putting stuff like this out instead of the other trash he's put out. This will be a huge hit amongst all Hip Hop fans. After watching this you get great understanding how great of producer Daz is."
1,Very poor quality,"This was a huge disappointment. Messy editing, hardly understandable and/or audible interviews conducted by a someone with a handycam. Without any external microphones or additional lightning. The liveclips are of cellphone quality. All in all the quality of the whole production is really unbelivabely bad. Probably only enjoyable for the cast and a huge dissappointment for any fan."
5,Excellent idea to teach rhythmic reading!,"I just finished watching MOST of Pat Petrillo's new DVD, ""How to Read Rhythms...Better"" and it is everything it claims to be- a comprehensive, concise visual explanation for reading rhythms! Pat's patience and attention to detail facilitates his logical progression from the basics to complex rhythms. Plentiful exercises at various tempos and with a novel note pointer give the viewer lots to practice. This DVD would best be suited for anyone that was afraid to learn how to read rhythms (or afraid to admit so!) as well as Intermediate drummers looking to firm up their reading foundation. Teachers should find this DVD to be useful to study how an experienced teacher such as Pat explains reading topics, and could well use the video, or parts of it, with young students for reinforcement or as a change of methodology. I highly recommend this work which will leave you saying, ""Why didn't I think of creating this!"""
3,A little too basic,"I bought this DVD because I liked Pat's other DVD and saw the glowing reviews.The reality is that the information presented on this DVD is quite basic. That doesn't mean it's a bad DVD. It's well-made (though certainly not ""ground breaking""). However, if you read carefully you can get the exact same information from the notation guide of a drumming magazine.What the DVD does that you can't get from a magazine is walk you through it slowly and carefully. If you like that sort of thing, then buy it. But I was disappointed in the lack of depth. It most definitely isn't ""...a complete program that will teach you exactly how to READ RHYTHMS from beginning to advanced levels..."" Beginning - yes. Intermediate - somewhat. Advanced - no."
2,"Good quality, but very basic instruction","While the instructional quality of this DVD is very good, the content is very basic. If you know little or nothing about reading music, this will be helpful, but otherwise, there will not be much to learn here. The PDF files, though, are excellent warm-up or practice routines."
5,outstanding (essential) for beginning drummer,"Yes, it's true that Pat assumes the viewer starts with no knowledge of how to read rhythmic music notation. But where else would you start? The origin and pace of the material is way too easy/slow for an intermediate to advanced reader, but they aren't the intended audience. For someone who wants to learn how to read rhythmic music, but has no prior instruction, this is fabulous. Even for those that once knew, but need a refresher course, this is great. You're probably a bit more ""rusty"" than you think and Pat's presentation will not only reveal that, but help you hone your skills again. Can't recommend it high enough for those searching for an instructional DVD on this particular topic."
4,Great for Educational Purposes,"This book has some of the most beautiful pencil drawings I've seen in a children's book. While the story isn't overly enthralling, he does a great job of describing the animals and plants in detail to help the reader learn about each one and to really imagine they are there on the prairie. We will be using this book as a resource to study prairie life."
1,A Waste of Earspace,"This album could have been something, I mean the beats are okay on several tracks. . .but the rap lyrics throughout the entire album were ruined by Scorpio's obsession with pitch bending. All of the vocals come out slow and droned. . .turns the album into a bad dream."
3,Prime Pacific Trading Stainless Stell Stockpot set,"Product deliver on time, material is a bit thin but is sufficient for soap making, excellent that all four pots comes with lid."
3,you get what you pay for.,for the price it's not a bad product. a little thin as far as the steel itself. so burning things is something you have to look out for. great for boiling things that don't burn.they are a little smaller then they say. about 20% smaller each.
5,Great value for set of 4 pots,Very decent quality. This is a great set of pots for miscellaneous cooking purposes.
2,got just what I paid for,got just what I paid for. Handles are riveted on and will leak. they are super light weight. stamped out lids are warped but like I said only got what I paid for and they are working for me.
2,"Low quality, but cheap","The pan set is very low quality--they do not sit flat on my electric stove-top, therefore don't heat quite evenly. But, at a fraction of the price of a quality stock pot, they serve their purpose for for seasonal canning, and the two or three batches of beer we make a year."
1,20QTs - not really,The largest pot is maybe 14Qts as delivered to me. Did not look right from the size of the box and sure enough I filled a 2qt container 6 times and dumped the water in. Pretty close to the top already.That is why it is so cheap combined with the absolute thinnest steel pot I have ever seen.Doesn't anyone at Amazon actually check this stuff before they list it for sale?Not worth the hassle of returning for $20
3,Perfect for liquid soap making - wouldn't use them in my kitchen,"How do I rate these? I bought these to make liquid soaps and using lye I definitely needed stainless. So that being said, these were cheap and they are just that - cheap. I would never buy them for my kitchen to make food but as far as soap goes, who cares, they are stainless and the perfect size - and there are four of them, yippee. The lids were all out of shape, there are scratches inside the pots, they are ""cheap"" but perfect for what I am using them for so judge for yourself, is it important that they be perfect for what you are using them for? I say again, how do I rate these? I guess 2 or 3 stars."
4,Shorter Christina Prayer,Great price. Perfect size for ease of storage and use. Shipped promptly. Eactly what we were looking for.
2,Very confusing and the return policy is frustrating,"I read other reviews about this being a confusing prayer book and thought I could still figure it out, but if you are like me and have precious few moments to pray, you won't want to spend them trying to figure out this book. This is only for folks who know it well and can jump right in. If the publisher actually wanted the faithful to enjoy this, they would have put good instructions in the beginning. Furthermore, when I returned it, they took off 50% of the refund because I had tried to use it for 3 weeks before I sent it back."
3,Only so-so compilation,"I normally love most things Ken Burns, but this was rather disappointing...the selections here are unremarkable and even dull often, just don't have the effortless joyful schwing of Bechet's best work but rather seem too analytical and academic.I'd much more recommend ""The Legendary Sidney Bechet"" and ""The Best of Sidney Bechet"" for those looking for an intro to Bechet's special genius."
4,Good value,"Good value for your money. Not that I was crazy about them all. I don't really like ""Waiting to exhale"", I thought ""Brown sugar"" was just ok (but don't blame me- I watch anything with Sanaa Lathan in it :D), I enjoyed ""How stella got her groove back"". And that just about sums up my review on the ""it's a love thang"" box set."
3,"Okay, but not the best","If you're just getting into reading about reincarnation, this book is probably a good place to start. Many sources are mentioned and compiled in one volume of very interesting stories.However, if you've already done some reading on the subject, you'll probably find that many of the stories are familiar. People who've been into reincarnation for a while would probably do better to read the books that these stories are taken from.The book is also riddled with typos, so I'm not going to give it any more than 3 stars. In the era of spell-checking software, there's no reason for any book to spell ""was"" as ""wass""."
3,A BOOK Full OF Other Book's Stories,"After just reading several book on Reincarnation this week I felt a bit cheated by this book. It is well written and as the other review says it is a good book for someone who is just starting out reading about this subject. I had just read Ian Steven's book and his cases are in this book, just not as detailed. Jenny Cockell's Yesterday's Children is also here as well as Brian Weiss, and about 20 other authors as well. I was expecting a ""Fresh"" book with new stores, new research not a book about other books. It is like picking up a herbal book and seeing the same book repeated over and over as I have been the unfortunate victim of by authors who cannot do their own research for. The author repeats that he is the publisher of a reaincarnation magazine (I cannot find) so his stories are all from sources not his own. Get it from a library or buy it used."
3,"It's a book, OK. But do not spend your money buying it... get a better one.","I bought the book because it was recommended as the best book to get started in reading about re-encarnation. Big mistake, this is s collection of short news, notes, or anecdotes with no substance at all. It does not cover any research done on this aspect, or documented cases. Most cases refer to early 20th century, or in India, where there has not been any documentation. Do not spend your money on this book, get another one."
3,Past Life Memories of Children meets Past Life Regression Hypnosis,"I was really looking for an account of the past life memories of children (ala Ian Stevenson), but the book also covers the more fantastical accounts of people who ""remember"" past lives through hypnosis or dreams. To me these regressions, especially the group hypnosis ones, are much less convincing, and they take away from the more serious accounts in the book."
2,dissapointing,"An amazon marketplace seller accidentally sent this used book to me, so I perused it out of curiosity before sending it back. What struck me was how un-striking the ""striking evidence"" was. Furthermore, there has been a lot of scientific research recently that flies in this face of this ""evidence"". Several different stimuli (high-G-force and electromagnetic stimulus of the brain) can readily produce near-death symptoms (""floating"" or ""tunnels of light""). Additionally, people like Penn & Teller, James Randi, etc., have shown how easy it is to convince yourself and others that past lives are real. Therefore I would expect a modern book on this topic to address these aspects, in order to be ""striking"". This book's ""striking evidence"" is basically just 20th-century hear-say."
5,Great lightweight cord,"This is a lighter weight (thinner), longer, and cheaper option to theM12 Replacement Coil Cord. They will both work with the same phones and amplifiers."
4,Useful...if you follow the directions,"This book is very useful, but keep this in mind: it does not actually contain many useful facts. It is an outline of what to study and several useful tips on how to study it. Besides this book you will need a source of information on teaching theory. Your college textbooks work nicely, as does a well-stocked library.With this in mind, I would recommend this book to anyone taking the Praxis tests."
4,Excellent,This book was a great study tool for the Praxis PLT. It provides exact structure of questioning and case studies with various correct answers and rationale.
2,There are better out there,I graduated years ago and moving to Ohio made me get the Ohio license so I bought this book to refresh mi mind. I did not find it too helpful because is only guidelines of what you have to study from other resources. Enough said I did not pass the test.
5,The Granny,"I love the way Brendan O'Carroll puts his words together, I also love the characters and the stories he has created. I'll be watching for more of his books now."
4,The Granny,"Brendan O'Carroll's The Granny is the conclusion of the Agnes Browne books and continues it's wonderful tradition of laughter and pain. This will have you laughing along with the spunky Browne Family, whose deadpan humor navigates them through their poverty. This light hearted if not at times tragic novel will have reader laughing, crying and marveling at the strength of friendship and family."
5,The Granny,"I just finished the third book in the trilogy and wish there were more to go! His characters are so real, they make you laugh and cry. I liked that the books left you feeling good. I truly enjoyed these books and will recommend them to all my reading friends!"
5,Among my Favorites,"The Granny, along with The Young Wan, The Mammy, and The Chisellers is among my prized book collections that I share with many others but insist that they are returned to me. Somehow The Granny was lost so I had to quickly replace it. I recommend these stories about one Irish family and the joys and trials of irish life to all who enjoy reading fun and heartwarming Irish literature."
5,Please Brendan write some more !!!,"A BEAUTIFUL BOOK WHICH MADE ME LAUGH SO MUCH, AND THEN ALSO CRY !!When I see a dragonfly I will think of Agnes.."
5,3 out of 3,"Just brillant, I loved all three books. I wish I hadn't read them so I could start all over again. It is so hard not to fall in love with Agnes Browne and any one of her kids, they left me wanting more."
1,Not all ingredients shown,If you go to the Vitamin Shoppe website and look up this item you get a complete listing of the ingredients.One of them being Sorbitol. Now why would they want to add sorbitol to a capsule. It's used as an artificial sweetener that gives you diarhea and can upset stomach if you take too much of it. I'm not buying this item. Too much artificial crap included in the capsule.
2,plastic threads crack easily,"...Not a big fan of this product, this is the second one that I have bought and the first one I had I thought that maybe I overtightened the cap causing it to crack and leak.Now being on my second fuel bottle I have been very careful whith tightening the cover...yes it did last a little longer but sure enough within a month of owning it and after about 5 refills the damn thing cracked and is now no good considering the last thing you need on your fingers and on anything it touches is NITRO FUEL!! all in all I would never purchase this specific bottle again considering I already know what to expect.No I would not reccomend this specific fuel bottle to other buyers.....very cost efficient product but look forward to buying another one within a couple months ....unless you dont mind nitro fuel on your hands and whatever you set the bottle down on."
2,"Not entirely without merit, but not the best.","The ending is not fully satisfying. There are some redeeming bits in the film, but this story could have been much stronger with significant changes. Don't pay a lot to watch it. I saw it on Netflix."
4,Good Begining Macroeconomics Text,"An introduction to macroeconomics written by the creator of the Taylor Rule. It begins with an overview of economics in general including market economies and the supply/demand model. Later topics include measuring GDP, the spending allocation model, unemployment, productivity, money, inflation, fiscal policy, monetary policy, financial markets, and international trade. The text has bright, eye-catching graphics and convenient review boxes placed throughout the chapters but tends to focus more on the U.S. economy than economies in general."
2,reasonably complete but poorly organized,"I have found homeopathy to be incredibly helpful for me personally so I was very interested in a book on this topic. I did read the book cover-to-cover, however I was disappointed by the organization... it includes sections on ""what to do when"" BUT in other (unrelated) parts of the book it will throw out lines such as ""XYZ is the best remedy to try in this situation"" but there's no way you'd ever know that if you had simply used the index or looked in the section ABOUT that particular situation. So in order to get the full value out of the book, you'd have to memorize it cover-to-cover so you'll actually be able to find the information you need at the moment when you need it, without re-reading the entire thing.... which a person is very unlikely to be able to do during labor!"
2,Who needs 3 maps of Central Washington DC???,"I was very disappointed to find that there were 3 maps included in this package and all 3 had the exact same map of Central Washington, DC on one side. The other side had either a poorly detailed map of Montgomery County, MD; Prince George's County, MD; or Northern VA along with a small map of all the Metro station neighborhoods in the respective area."
4,"Some good, some ok, all of it unique and definitely worth getting","French music, like their culture, is very unique. We all don't really get enough of it. I won't turn this into a rant about pop music, but you can't deny that this is a lively collection.There's some great songs, like the big-band uptempo jazzy J'ai Aurais Bien Voulu, the quaint and earnest J'ai Change (I have changed) and the bright La Cigarette. Some of them are absolutely full of energy and excitement.There's a couple of covers, one of them a Jack Johnson cover, which are good.There are some bad songs, like the repulsive Bitches on the Ground which sounds like a boy-band song, and there's a few more morose songs which sound a bit boring.This is a compilation, so you can just skip through the songs you don't like. The chances are, though, you'll single out 5 or so pearls and listen to them ad nauseum, cos they are great."
5,Amazing,"Its Amazing to me that someone can review an older release and say it sounds dated, or has post-disco cliches, etc.Um, yah, it is over 20 years old. I love Chaka Khan too but I dont complain that Feel 4 U sounds dated.In Los Angeles, Angel was played constantly at kute.fm Which is why i bought the album. But what is really amazing about this album, in relationship to Ms. Baker's later material, is that to me, it sounds like she opened up vocally on it. Yes, there are some unusual-for-her faster tunes and thank goodness. Her voice is literally all over the charts, and not a bum note anywhere. I love her material, but there is certainly a ""sameness"" quality to her later releases, and this under-rated album added a variety of flavors.It was a great day for us music collectors who found this one on cd finally and i enjoy it still today, over 20 years later."
4,MY FIRST THOUGHTS,"WHEN I HEARD NO MORE TEARS AND ANGEL .EVEN THOUGH I WAS YOUNG THAT VOICE STAYED WITH ME THEN I HEARD AINT NO NEED TO WORRY WITH THE WINANS AND THAT WAS ALL SHE WROTE I WAS HOOKED.EVER SINCE THEN IVE BEEN A FANATIC OF THIS LADY AND SHE GIVES A HELL OF A SHOW, CANT NOBODY TOUCH ANITA HANDS DOWN"
4,A classic revisited.,"When first released in 1983, ""The Songstress"" was dismissed by many as an over-arranged and uninspired album. Despite including the Top 10 R&B hit single ""Angel"" the album itself faded rather quickly from the charts and such Quiet Storm gems as ""Sometimes"",""You're The Best Thing Yet"" and ""Will You Be Mine?"" got virtually no airplay (it's also worth noting that this album was originally released by Beverly Glen Records- a tiny Los Angeles-based independent label that could not market or promote its artists like the major labels). ""The Songstress"" nonetheless remains an essential part of any Anita Baker and/or Quiet Storm music fan's library."
4,"Get to know Anita Baker, preRapture","This wasn't her breakthru album, but it is very good. It took quite some time for this cd to be available and I was quite happy to get it.""Angel"" is wonderful and it fits what other work you may have heard her sing. The other titles such as ""Feel The Need"" and ""No More Tears"" are also terrific. But M's Baker's voice is such that she can take a song that isn't so great (""Squeeze Me"") work for her.I advise buying this cd and getting to know Anita Baker from her pre ""Rapture"" days as it's definitely worth the effort."
3,She's improved since this one,"At a friend's house, I listened to a newer album by Anita Baker, and decided to buy her CD's, starting with her first (""Songstress"").This was a mistake; this album, although not bad for a debut, is quite a ways from her newer efforts.Buy it only if you absolutely MUST have everything by Anita Baker."
3,Songstress is an Angel,"When I first heard ""Angel,"" and ""You're the Best Thing Yet,"" I fell in love again with Anita Baker voice and music."
4,"The GREAT 'SONGSTRESS"", Anita Baker!","Anita's first solo album presents her talents to us in the purest form.The production is laid back, and she is allowed to bring passion and sincerity to the mike like never before."
3,A LOST TREASURE,I have been such a long time fan of Anita Baker. This album is just a foreshadowing of what Anita would be become. THE SONGSTRESS is not as well known as RAPTURE but she shows a lot of promise.She was only 25 years old when this album was released but she shows a lot of maturity. I like the simplicity of the songs. She was just beginning to find her sound.Anita is an artist that still has not gotten full credit for her influence on music today. Without her you wouldn't have Mary J. Blige or Toni Braxton.
4,Works just like it's suppose to,"The house we rent has a small washer/dryer and the vent runs up and out through the ceiling. The dryer motor isn't strong enough to push all the lint up and out so we ran the ProFlex down to the floor and now the dryer works much better.The only issue is that on a warm day, the heat from the dryer stays in the house and can make it even warmer inside. On the upside, on a cold day we don't have to run the heat so much."
3,Not too happy with this,"It's just OK. I bought it to go with my new Sonya Portable Compact Dryer. However, it doesn't fit well to the back exhaust vent."
5,"Works great, low price","Bought this unit to install on my Haier portable dryer. I think its a fabulous solution for installing a dryer in an apartment not equipped with a dryer vent hookup. I put a nylon stocking over the inner portion of the vent hose, which goes all the way down into the water bucket - - that way, I can catch and dispose of big pieces of lint easily and there is no chance they'll fly out the holes in the bucket and into the air. I still change the water in the bucket with each dryer load for safety, though. Thus far, happy with this."
4,Great.,"This is one of the most compact and efficient portable dryer vent I have seen, additionally, it is very good you can vent right where the dryer is located, you just have to remember to change the water after the drying is done."
3,Just Okay,This serves the purpose but very disappointed in the construction. Vent holes let out lint so not sure if this will be very efficient for indoor use.
2,Only if you are desperate,You must stretch a stocking over this unit or your walls will be covered in lint.The stocking got clogged with lint and needed to be cleared about every 3 loads.I found this messy and difficult to do.This device does nothing to reduce humidity. It is just a bucket of water with a fancy top to hold the vent hose. I have hired someone to permanently vent my dryer as this is not a permanent solution.
4,Does the job,"Lives up to expectations. Really have no complaints. Sometimes the tub can be difficult to insert, but it stays on once it's on."
5,This is the product you NEED if you have an appt dryer,If you have an appartment sized dryer this is a must have. You just put a little water in the bottom of it and it catches all the dust. Cleanup is simple although I would recommend the metal clamps instead of the plastic ones that come with it.
2,I would not use this indoor in any situation.,"the product itself is decently built. However, I would not use this indoor in any situation. Even in a room with a fan this puts out far to much moisture. The product does work but over time you will see problems because of the moisture. my washer and dryer are in the garage and I will not continue to use it for fear of ruining my walls. you can imagine what it would do to a small indoor laundry room or apartment."
3,Too much work..................,"This seemed like a good idea at the time. But, when I read the instructions and discovered it had to be taken apart and refilled with water after every dryer load, it was too much of a hassle."
5,heat the house while you dry,Love this product. Easy to install to dryer. I heat the downstairs while I dry the cloths. Also adds moisture to the air. Great for winter.
4,works fine,"this is exactly as described, and works just fine. does make the room VERY HUMID. and only to be used with electric, NOT GAS dryers. i also bought the ...Dundas Jafine CHK100ZW Heat Keeper Kit With 2 Clamps ... all worked together fine"
2,you have to fill it with water,"I didn't know that when I bought it, so have not used it yet. It makes it less convenient to use."
2,not for me,did not like this product . you put water in to keep from lint going every where . would not buy another one .
4,Pleasantly surprised,When I got the box I thought there was a mistake cause I envisioned the bucket to be much larger. I was worried about the space it would take. But it turns out to be quite small - about 5x6 inches. Construction seems OK it should hold up for quite a while. Opens and closes easily for cleaning. The only improvement to make is like another poster said put a stocking or netting over the vent holes to trap any stray lint.
3,Don't use this if you have a gas dryer,"This looks like a good idea - for electric dryers- if you don't have moisture problems in your house. But if you have a gas dryer it would be against the gas code and dangerous, gas dryers produce carbon monoxide, colorless. odorless and bad for you if not fatal."
3,not great,I do not see how this is going to prevent lint and dust from blowing all over your laundry room and ending up all over your house. I think it will increase the amount of times you have to dust every week. Dusting is soooo boring. The hose that came with it is nice and eventually I will replace my existing hose with it. That is the only reason I did not return the item. Ultimately I just put a knee high nylon over the end of my existing hoseand plugged the outlet to outdoors. My main goal was to keep the heat and humidity in the house over the cold nothern winters.
1,Don't buy thru Deerso,"The item works just fine, howevever, the buying experience thru Deerso was terrible. I paid extra for expedited delivery but after they shipped it they said it would still be seven days from the time I ordered until the time I got it. The customer service people totally didn't care. I will never order anything thru Deerso again!"
4,dundas dryer vent,"I needed to buy new 4"" hose clamps ad extra hose. The unit is just what I needed and works well."
2,hose will not stay connected to dryer,"I think this is a great idea but the hose will not stay connected to the dryer, even with the plastic clamp. Any suggestions?"
3,Dundas Jafine TDIDVKZW ProFlex Indoor Dryer Vent Kit,its great for me because i didn't have a dryer vent in the appartmant but this baby does the job better than i though.
2,Cheap alternative,Its a good buy for the prize.Con. It does not filter the odour. So your room will have the smell of your detergent
4,Quicher Whinin Bad Reviewers!,"Okay, so the sound suffers a very tiny bit of early 90's digital infancy ""remastering"" of the tracks, which I'll drop one star. But no big deal, really. This is Absolutely Live, Alive She Cried and Hollywood Bowl wrapped into one happy package...one of the few instances The Doors repackaging crew got something right because ""Alive"" and ""Hollywood"" were available for only a few years prior to this package.Why Elektra or The Doors Camp decided to go back to Absolutely Live a few years after In Concert was issue, I'll never know...but go figure...it's The Doors catalog and it hasn't made much sense since ""Gold Mine"" (1972) except with this one and the Perception box. Get this one because it's one of the few where they get it right."
5,great compilation album,"this cd spans three of the doors live albums and includes a never released the end, great versions of back door man, five to one, break on through and a good preformance of celebration of the lizard, buy this you will be impressed at the live power of the doors"
2,"Something Better, Ya Think","I got this one & thought that the material & original album ""Absolutely Live"" was utterly terrible when it was originally released. So they re-release it with other vinyl gem (released later) on this set. I think if your just completing a collection, then this is fine. If you really want great ""Live"" Doors material, get the ""Live"" Philly or Detroit CD's. When this was released they should have forgot the ""Absolutely Live"" material & replaced it with some really important ""Live"" recordings. Also check out my mini site on msn ""Judemac Forever"""
2,Some decent tracks but dissapointing overall...(2.5 stars),"In Concert is a series of Doors songs taken from various concerts during their more raucous period. As someone who prefers live vs. studio 99% of the time I was hoping for more from this album. I refuse to believe that these were the best versions of these songs and this album is pretty much plauged by bad choices.I never really bought into Morrisson's ""poetry"" nor all of his psychadelic mind freeing mantras. He blabs and blabs on many of the tracks rendering them pretty much unplayable. There are some fantastic instances of the rest of the band's brillaince shining through such as in Love Me Two Times and Break on Through. Unfortunately there are just two many instances of Morrisson going off on some tangent or screaming into the microphone.Bottom Line: If drunken rambling at nauseum is your thing then this is the record for you."
3,Ego Got in the way,"I was excited for two cd live set but was disappointed when I listened to Morrison chattering poetry like a hopped up parrot. God. Maybe that is what he was like live...tho this is a compilation live album so not sure,,,but this needed to be one cd, editing out the poetry slam. Know he fancied himself as a poet first and singer second but this does not age well. Don't buy this set."
4,Good Stuff!,"A good live album, full of energy, that, sadly, I misplaced along the way. But for those of us who didn't get to hear The Doors live, this strikes me as a great substitute."
2,Disappointed,"We were disappointed in this DVD and thought it was a waste of money. We did not learn anything new. They went through things quickly, everything was so basic, things that are mainly common sense. I felt this was a big huge waste of money, and is now in the trash."
4,Very informative for new moms,I found this dvd to be very informative. The format was laid out well and the actual demonstrations on the video were very helpful to see for a first-time mom. A lot of my questions were answered and I liked the fact that there were excerpts from an ob-gyn and pediatrician. I would recommend this video to a friend.
2,"Try ""Laugh & Learn"" instead","Expecting our first, my wife and I have bought several DVDs related to childbirth, etc. We first chose to purchase ""Bringing Baby Home"" rather than ""Laugh & Learn"" because the reviews and descriptions made it seem much better. But we found ""Bringing Baby Home"" somewhat disappointing. We really liked the other DVDs in the ""Laugh & Learn"" series, so we came back and bought the Newborn Care one. ""Laugh & Learn About Newborn Care"" is much better than ""Bringing Baby Home"". More comprehensive and better presentation. Very well done like all the ""Laugh & Learn"" series."
5,A soon-to-be dance craze in the US!,"We came across this song during our recent vacation in Cancun. This is a great and fun group dance song.When ""Follow The Leader"" becomes the next big dance craze to sweep the US (a la the Macarena) remember where you heard it first! ;-)I snatched this up immediately and know it will always bring back memories of our wonderful vacation in the beautiful Riviera Maya section of Cancun!"
2,Very Short Battery Life,"I have owned my gauge for about three years now, but the non-replaceable battery is dead already, so the unit is worthless now. I originally purchased the gauge based solely for its shape, which fits my motorcycle. It can be difficult to fit a tire gauge around the dual front rotors. I am looking at options now - I will not buy this gauge again."
2,disposable after 2-3 years: Handy convenient &functional while it lasts,"31 Jan 2010 I bought this about 6 months ago and it is both convenient and works very well. Have checked tire pressure every weekend, with no problems.5 Feb 2012 2 year later update - This still works great!3 March 2012 Dead battery ...Tried changing the battery, with micro screwdrivers and the circuit board has 8 tiny screws - but you only need to remove the four furthest from the nozzle. Battery is a lithium CR1632.Got this far and had second thoughts after reading a prior review about resetting.The process is a nuisance and not worth the effort. Will update after getting the replacement battery."
2,Short Life,"I have owned four of these. One for the motorcycle, one for the truck, and one each for the cars.The Good:These gauges are accurate, repeatable, and very small.The Bad:They are disposable. I get maybe a year out of them, which is perhaps 2 uses. I tried to replace the battery in one. It would be somewhat challenging for someone who did not have the necessary micro screw drivers and the patience to remove various items. Inside you will find a shoddy piece of electrical tape holding the battery in place - nice touch. After I installed a new battery, reassembled the gauge, and turned it on, I discovered that it reset itself to units that are unfamiliar to me, perhaps pascals. I never did figure out how to change the units. The price of the product is not worth the time I put into it anyway.I don't recommend this digital pressure gauge."
2,Good gauge but only expect one year of life,"The gauge is (was)small, and seemed to be accurate. Like the other reviewers, mine died after a bit over a year. It is advertised as having a lifetime battery. That might be true if you are talking about the lifetime of a field mouse.I also tried changing the battery, with results similar to the previous reviewer. I through it away and got a trusty mechanical dial gauge instead. I do not recommend this product."
1,"Do not buy - same as other reviews SHORT BATTERY LIFE, TOO EXPENSIVE TO BE DISPOSABLE","Weak...bought for a bike trip and by the time the ride was over, the battery was dead. Very disappointed and waste of $20"
1,POS,"The first RoadGear tire gauge arrived dead on arrival. The seller had the nerve to charge me return shipping before sending a replacement, which died after only a few months. Ever been stuck out in the middle of nowhere trying to inflate your tires using a bad pressure gauge? This is a clear case of product liability and ought to be taken off the market. Needless to say, I'll never buy another RoadGear accessory again."
1,Dead on Arrival,I made the mistake of ignoring the bad experiences that other contributors said they had with this tire gauge. My optimism was rewarded with the receipt of a gauge that was dead on arrival. The gauge display would only show all number eights. There is apparently little to no quality control on this product. I have disposed of mine in the trash and am once again looking for a quality tire guage with a 90 degree neck for use on my motorcycles.
2,The foam covers turned to dust,"The foam covers on the ear buds turned to dust. They appeared to have dry rotted from age and the minute I touched them they turned to dust. Other than that I was happy with the purchase. The rubber ear tips were fine, it was just the two foam ones that disintegrated."
1,Don't buy Acorn slippers,"Don't buy Acorn products. I've had my last pair of Acorn slippers for 10 years, used to think pretty highly of their products. My wife just bought me a new pair and evidently they're all made in China now! My old ones were made in the USA. If they want to make them in China, let them stay there. The quality has definetly gone down hill..........a lot. These new ones will not last like the first ones I had, the liners and stitching are crap and the soles will be worn through in no time. We're returning them for something of better quality made here in the U.S. Don't support these greedy companies that export jobs and make inferior products, buy quality, buy American. It may cost a little more but you'll have something you won't be a shamed of."
3,Polar Moc failure,"I have been very happy with my Acorn slippers bought from Amazon 12/11. However, the left slipper sole has separated from the uppers. The slippers are used only indoors. Acorn has a 1 year warranty. You must ship the slipper back with a $5 inclosed and then within the next 4 weeks Acorn will ship a new pair.I use a pair if slippers whenever I am in the house as we do not wear outside footwear in the house. Since going barefoot for any length of time gives me foot pain, the time lapse between return and a new pair is not acceptable. In talking to Acorn customer service I was unable to have the policy waved.The only reason I am giving the slippers 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 is that the slippers have been very comfortable and I am assuming that this defective pair is an anomaly."
5,Like walking on clouds...Temperpedic clouds.,"Major upgrade over my last pair of slippers. I can't recommend these enough. They are warm, durable, and extremely comfortable."
4,Sizing: the sequel,"Like 'Howard' (the previous reviewer), I also wear a 10.5, so I ordered the larger size and, as you might guess, they're too big. Perhaps Acorn should consider making a 'Goldilocks' 10-11 size, since this is the most common shoe size. The slippers are nice though."
2,Comfortable but not durable,"Unlike other reviewers who find this a long-lasting slipper, I have not and therefore can't give it high marks. I like the slipper as it's comfortable and because it has a back works well for me, as I need to wear orthotics. I have had two pairs of these, and neither lasted a year. In both cases the sole has separated from the upper. For a slipper of this price, that is unacceptable.Subsequent to writing this, I bought a pair of Isotoner slippers that are the same style as the Acorns. I've had them nearly four months and find them equal to the Acorns at a lower price. If they last a year or more (at which time I'll report back) I would recommend them over the Acorns."
3,Definitely good slippers; but not great.,"I wear 10.5, ordered size 9-10 in Black, and the fit is good, very slipper-like (loose but not floppy). Color is much darker than photo, which I like. The sole does have heel rise similar to normal shoes, as noted in the product description. If you are looking for flat sandals, this isn't it. As far as warmth goes, the fabric is very warm BUT the fit is not conforming so they feel a bit drafty around the heel and top of the foot. I suppose this will vary from person to person, but I'd prefer a ""furry"" liner that conforms better. Also, being synthetic, they feel a bit humid on the foot, just like synthetic fabric socks. The best thing about these slippers is that they stay put when you are slipping them on or off, thanks to a grippy sole--no hands required. All in all: a good value but I will keep my eye out for something better."
3,Lacking...,"First off, I should mention that Tim Gautreaux is one of my favorite short story writers. However, it seems his sense of humor, strong command of language, creativity, and purposeful pace lack in his novels. This is a good story, the situation and scene are intriguing, but I can't help feeling Mr. Gautreaux could have written a couple of outstanding short stories from this material instead of a rather dull novel."
3,The Clearing,very much like Conrad's _Heart of Darkness_ and equally difficult to read... is this what you call a men's novel?
5,Cover,This fits perfect 1st time I took it of I was surprised after several days of rain the car was perfect. Shiny and clean
1,Horribly designed-essentially non-functional and useless,"My employer got a bunch of these for my project group. I have had Plantronic headsets in the past at other jobs and they were fine. This is utter junk. The attachment for ear only simple does not work. It is cheap rubber and doesn't conform to any ear correctly. The headset is way too small to fit around the average head size and doesn't stay in place very well at all and is not comfortable. I don't know what the product design cycle and testing/QA process was for this product, but it is a total disaster. I would not pay $5 for this this yet it is going here for about 10 times that. Unreal."
2,If I had to choose...,"I don't think I would buy this particular kind again. I'm used to using a double headset, and this single one is just hard to use. I generally put in a headset so I can hear better. Also, If you don't cram, and I DO mean CRAM, the mic next to your face, no one can hear you.I use this headset at work, (at a call center), and honestly, my old crappy one that work gave me was better. I just don't think I will buy it again."
4,sturdy durable toy and fun,my granddaughter loved this and remember those paper clothes with the folded tabs that never stayed on when I was a kid I thought this was the greatest invention and she loved them.
5,Very cute and entertaining toy!,"I bought these dolls for my 1.5 year old daughter. She loves them! They look like toddlers of her age and they have the same type of clothes my daughter has. She is not capable of dressing her 3D dolls yet, but she loves to apply clothes to these 2D paper dolls. She also like to sort the clothes and stick them to the fridge. She was disappointed that the dolls themselves don't stick to the fridge. So I glued a magnet to the dolls as well. It says that it is a choking hazard for kids below 3. But my daughter doesn't have a habit to put small parts into her mouth anymore. And I hided small parts (socks) from her. It is very nicely done dolls, very cute. They have no smell. I recommend!"
1,Hated it...,"I don't like this cd at all. The concept of the album is ""old school,"" meaning all of the songs are supposed to be reminiscent of the recordings from the 70s. While other neosoul artists use this concept, they do it with a new school flavor. This cd does not do that. I feel like if I really wanted something old school, I would have bought a Donny Hathaway cd, or a Marvin Gaye cd, or something along those lines. This cd is very different from his first cd (which I really enjoyed), and in my opinion, that is not a good thing. I listened to the whole cd, and none of the songs stand out to me, they all sound the same, so I really can't pin point a favorite."
2,Throw this stinker back over the fence,"I ordered this CD with high expectations, based on his excellent last album.But Once Again has zero great tracks, and only 3 or 4 good ones. The rest of the album is pure filler; boring and uninspired lyrics set to elevator music. Maybe he's got nothing left to say?I didn't necessarily expect more Get Lifted, but I expected something better than this!"
5,really good,"was a tad dissapointed with his first cd ""get lifted"" but this one from begining to end is really good i really like how he incorperates a ""now a day"" sound with some music from back in the day really good cd 5 star"
5,Legendary,"For those interested in grown folks music, this one's definitely for you. Smooth, sultry, romantic, will love Again even if you have been hurt,wearing your heart on your sleeve kind of music. After his amazing concert in Trinidad & Tobago in August 2006, I hope that he would definitely be back soon so that we can do it Once Again and Slow Dance..............."
5,Unique...,"This album is a very unique, original offering from Mr. Legend and doesn't sound like anything on the market today. It has a totally different feel from other r&b albums and the uniqueness of the album is what I love most. It sounds like no other r&b offering that is out there. Plus, the album is just very cool and super easy for me to vibe to. I dig!"
3,"Just ok, not great","And therein lies the problem with this follow up. It's so personal and introspective that as a listener I feel somewhat detached from it. It's like listening to Muzak while in the waiting room at the dentist's office. Honestly I could take it or leave it, which is not the response I'd thought I would have had before listening to it. I understand wanting to go in a different direction than ""Get Lifted"", but to completely abandon the sound that helped make the first CD such a success in the first place wasn't a good idea in my opinion. In a concert setting, these new songs would really have to be remixed and amped up to get my attention. I will always be a ""Get Lifted"" fan; I just hope the next release a year or so from now embraces that sound once again."
5,Once Again Legend Delivers,"My fav cuts are Again and I cannot stop playing the soul stirring Show Me, if the lyrics and notes don't move you then you aren't breathing. I love the way John branches out beyond neo soul and pop on this album. I cannot wait for the live DVD version."
3,john legend second album It's ok. but ?,"I just want to say john legend is the bomb! but his second album really is as not as powerful then his debut album which is stillone of the best r&b; albums of 2005, for this one have a few catchy tunessuch as the great cover of ( save room) & ( each day gets better ) but hopefully the third album will again be the charm!"
5,"JL does it ""Once Again""","Corny title I know but it's fitting. I, admittedly, am a late fan of John Legend. I did not purchase his first album until 6 months after its initial release. I usually buy albums later than most to let the hoopla subside and engage the album for it's musical value. From ""Get Lifted"" a little over half of the songs appealed to the musician in me. That's a pretty good number considering the state of R&B;/Soul music. However, after picking up Once Again on it's release date I have been inspired by each and every song. I have already learned to play half of the album and have done self transcriptions of two of the songs(chords, bass, and melody)This album is a great follow up to, in my opinion, the best album in recent R&B;/soul history. It is a movement away from his ""Lifted"" style but if you listen to it ""Once"" you'll definitely do it ""Again"". ;-)"
5,A Definitive Outing,"Plain and simple: this is a great album, get it!Its a waste of time analyzing it track for track, the only thing you can do is listen through and enjoyA fun, mature, and soulful collection of songs -- John wasn't dubbed 'Legend' for nothing"
3,Great voice,"I first saw John Legend on a BET gospel special. Be aware if you are a gospel fan that some of these lyrics don't fit into that category! whoa. His vocals and piano are beautiful, though."
5,Wonderful!,"My Favorite Cut From This Cd Is ""Each Day Gets Better"". John Has A Very Different Stye Of His Own....Am Really Feeling Him......"
2,Not as good as the first one,"This album didn't move me. Definitely not as good as the first. Best song is ""Save Room."""
3,Cool...But Not Cold,"This was a good second try, but for sure not the CD I thought it would be. Good one to have if you are fan, because for sure you can not take away the vocals and the content of what he is doing on this. But the full CD gives me a 60's Rat Pack feel. But some songs do stand out."
2,Disappointed,"Based on a Newsweek recommendation, I'm a first time Legend buyer. After listening once, I tried to listen again and found myself at Half Priced Books where my $10 investment became .75 cents. At least the McDonald's coffee was good. The songs were smooth. Smooth as in flat, without interest or color. Were the words introspective and deeply meaningful? I don't know, my attention kept wandering.If jazzy, soulful, romantic ballads are for you grab this one. Its just not for me."
3,trouble in river city,"save room imediately struck me as being just a little too close to the classic four's stormy,in other words,i've not had any 'constant craving' to hear the stone's 'has anybody seen my baby' duh!!!!!!!"
2,Kind of disappointed,"For the John Legend fans who bought the 1st album like I did, this one is nothing like it. I love his voice sooo much, but the song choices were a bit of a let down. There are maybe 3 songs that I listen to. I would advize people to preview the tracks and buy the oes you really like on I-Tunes or something like that, that way you won't waste your money like I did."
3,Smooth Sounds,"The first song, ""Save Room"", is a complete copy of the old song ""Stormy."" This is my first John Legend album and I think it's good, smooth, and enjoyable - - but nothing groundbreaking. It's a good album to listen to while driving or as background music while doing chores. While I like it, it appears that he is capable of much more."
2,MsGenevaC,This album is pretty boring and one dimensional. I own his previous album and was extremly disappointed with the way this album came out. All the songs are slow and talk about the same thing. I wouldn't purchase unless you need something to put you asleep.
1,Copy-Cat,"The song ""Save Room"" is almost exactly like the Classics IV ""Stormy."" Listen to both and you'll see. I thought John Legend was supposed to be good. Turned me off really bad."
1,this is a big downstep,john legend dissappointed me....this is a not a good album compared to the first one.....maybe 2 tracks are worth buying it...
2,Now I'm going to be completely honest...,"Some people love this album, and that's just fine. I just have to tell the truth here. I really did not like this album at all. It is annoying.I know that after a great, critically-acclaimed debut, John wanted to deliver another classic. And it shows. This album is so clean cut and perfect. His diction is so precise on here that it is annoying. To me... it sounds like he sat in the studio for a year tweaking this up until it sounded perfect... trying so desperately to make a great album.The songs are like Starbucks material. Very boring and laid-back. And again, his diction and vocals are just so absolutely perfect that it is unnatural and quite frankly unlistenable to me. But that's just my two cents. Let the unhelpful votes roll..."
1,Disappointing,"I love you John. Really. really do, but I cannot listen to this Cd for a 2nd time. I'll await the next one."
2,"not quite ""again""","i recently borrowed the ""get lifted"" cd from the public library to try it out and was so amazed that so many of the other tracks haven't yet made it to radio rotation, that i was swept away by the diversity of the album, yet the continuity from track 1 to the end. i impulsively then bought both that cd and this new one based on its predecessor. boy was i disappointed. ""heaven"" the heavily played track is definitely the highlight (in my opinion) of this cd. you definitely hear the ecclectic john legend vibe, but it's a bit more fragmented (again, in my opinion).i'll know to wait on the library copy before committing again."
3,"OK....But, bring back the soul!","OK is all I can rate this sophomore CD by last year's best new artist. Legend seems to be going the POP route on this outing. He is best when he stays true to R&B with a funky edge as he demonstrated on his ""Get Lifted"" CD. BRING BACK THE FUNKY SOUL! I did like how he has shown a Burt Bacharach influence on his ""Maxine"" interlude. The vocal arrangement brings to mind the 5th Dimension and '60s Dionne Warwick. ""Each Day Gets Better"" has a Spinners musical setup as when they were produced by Thom Bell back in the day."
1,sounds like stormy,"song sounded familiar to me, then remembered the old song ""stormy"" by classic iv. It is exactly the same."
4,"What does the song ""stereo"" refer to?","I'm stumped, can someone tell me what JL's referring to in his song ""stereo""?"
2,"""Once Again I want to take it back!!""",If you're jonesing to hear some John Legend just break out the first cd because this one will not do it for you!!I was very disappointed with this cd - he has a beautiful voice - what happend to the ballads???Waste of another beautiful voice..
2,I'm not feeling this,"I bought this album wanting to like it, because I truly enjoyed his first cd. I've listened to it several times, but nothing really stands out for me. It has that lounge music vibe ... you hear it but you just don't feel it."
5,WoW!! Once Again a Legendary Album,"May I be one of the first to say that for me this album is Waaay!!! Better than John's first album ""Get Lifted"". The latter left me wanting more in the way of the piano melodies and more vocally. ""Once Again"" delivers all easily superceeds those requirements.From the opening track ""Save Room"" to the last emotionally thoughtful track ""Coming Home"" this album coasts. I can listen to the entire album without stopping once(a true rarity in the music scene). My favorite Tracks in order... PDA(We Just dont care), Save Room, Another Again, Where did my baby go, Each Day Gets Better. It really dosen't matter, I'm feeling them all. Gotta see the concert when it comes through, John Stephens A.K.A. John Legend put it down with this record. Just put the CD in and press PLAY!!! and let it ride."
5,Genius,"If you were not smitten by the John Legend bug with songs like 'Ordinary People' and 'So High', the album will definately do it. Love the ablum and I listened to it over and over ago the first few days after I got it."
4,John Legend,"If your any kind of fan of John Legend, then this is a great cd purchase. It has a great vibe to it, and u'll be sining and crusin along with it for sure."
5,Excellent Follow Up,"Not resting on his laurels, John Legend has expanded his musical prowess and has delivered a project that will be listened to for many, many years to come."
4,Once Again John Legend gives us a gem,"The very first time I listened to the CD I was kinda puzzled as to why the songs weren't as upbeat as the last album... However, the lyrics are hott and as soon as it was over, I pressed play cuz I was in love with what I'd heard! I just bought an ipod and this was the first thing to go on it....My fave tracks are Stereo, Slow Dance and Maxine...Hope you enjoy it as much as I do!!"
5,once again...,I am very pleased with my purchases. I received my cds within a few days and they were not damaged at all.
4,JOHN LEGEND IS THE SAVING GRACE OF TODAY'S R&B,"I love this cd...it's a beautiful cd which showcases his voice and piano playing...I didnt even know he had another cd coming out and they happpened to be playing it in FYE when i was looking for music, I fell for it automatically, I could tell it was John Legend but it was so much more grown up I almost 2nd guessed myself lol...I loved Get Lifted but I like Once Again even more, his voice has matured and sounds better then it did on get lifted...I love the fact that there are no hip hop cameo's on this cd...it flows like an old school R&B ablum with hints of Adult Contemporary...The kind of cd you can just put in and play and let it rock..."
2,a Broke Brian Mcknight meets Bobby Short,"John Legend maintains his Coffee house pass of music making on this follow up to his debut. alot of the tracks sound like bits&pieces from yesteryear with not much Orginality in there. his vocal runs all pretty much sound the same. ""Save room"" echos the same 60's vibe that ""ordinary people"" did on his debut.""Stereo"" is a Decent track,but there is nothing on here that moves me. his vocals as with much of his music pretty much puts me to sleep. he lacks any kind of personality as a Artist to me."
2,Not made in France,"Sorry but when did Le Crueset move production to Thailand. I have 2 pieces and while they function as promised, I won't be adding more to my collection. B4 anyone accuse me of being racist, let me state that I am Asian."
4,"Best Of Acapella, Volume 2","It was still in 1965 that the second Relic Record was produced. The first was selling well in a streetcorner underground around New York City and Philadelphia. Eddie Gries and his partners decided to start producing their own acappella sessions. They began with the popular group, the Chessmen. The Holidays were a young group which auditioned right in the Times Square Record Shop. The Citadels were the first mixed group to record acappella, streetcorner style. The Youngtones were a young Latino group who almost made it big. This second record was rounded out with leased masters by the Delstars of ""Zoop Bop"" fame (remember them?) and the Five Jades. None of these songs had been released before Best of Acappella Vol 2. The CD is packaged with the same images which a adorned the original album jacket and includes the original album notes."
5,"If you are a gamer and don't own this item, you should.","My copy of this wonderful booklet is so worn from use it looks like it has been through hell and back. It's chock full of everyday items that ANY DM/GM and player may want or need. Think of it as an old Sears and Roebuck catalog from the early 1900s, with wonderful ""reviews"" on many items and a real salesmanship feeling to the descriptions.Trust me, you will love it, and it makes for a great prop in ANY game."
4,Good starter for ideas,"This book is useful for DMs of all experience levels. It has some obvious and some unique items that can help jump-start your imagination. While not necessary, it's been a nice addition to my library.Works fine for all fantasy games; just may need to adjust prices."
5,A Jazz Masterpiece,"This album is a duet between Michel Petrucciani and the bassist Ron Mc Clure; this is an excellent album, totally worth listening to; this is high level music, a music you'll never get tired of.Buy it with confidence."
1,Do Not Buy This Version,I have nothing against the guide itself. I have several earlier copies but I would warn anyone to check the book first. In the copy I have the pages between 496 and 561 are entirely missing. Pages 961 to 1024 are in it twice. A gross error by the publisher that should never have been shipped.
2,The Guide's shrinking!,"Every other year I replace my dog-eared Maltin Guide with a new one. The 2006 Guide is noticeably smaller than the 2004--with 2,000 FEWER entries! Like many film buffs, I use the Guide as a reference book. Film info and stats are more valuable to me than the reviews, i.e., who is that actress? when was is shot? is it available on DVD yet?, etc. I wonder what criteria were used in excising such a large chunk of film history.Now I'll have to hang on to the old dog-eared version for films cut from the 2006. Come on, Leonard!"
2,"Too much of the time, too little or too much","To me this movie guide is maddening.Some of my favorite films of all time have been sorely underrated. Fabulous Baker Boys, 2-1/2 starts? Nixon, 3 stars? Natural Born Killers, 1-1/2 stars? Rumble Fish, 2-1/2 stars? My Dinner with Andre, 2-1/2 starts?? TAXI DRIVER, 2 STARS??? Geeeez!!And then there are the overrated movies. Runaway Bride, 3 stars? Gone with the Wind, 4 stars? Ordinary People, 4 stars?? Kramer vs. Kramer, 4 stars??? Whaaaa??Maddening. Absolutely maddening. And that's just a quick sample. The list goes on and on.But I still purchased the darn book. Whenever I feel the need to bounce against the walls, well, I just read this thing."
1,Movie Guide,"The book is comprehensive. Very seldom you try to look up a picture or video which is not in the book. The reviews are sometimes too short, however, the book would be too unhandy if every picture had a bigger review. Also the facts about the different movies are accurate and helpful."
5,2006 Movie Guide,"This book is a great all-inclusive compilation of movies ranging from older hard-to-find, to popular pop culture films. Excellent listings, complete with a section on how to search for actors and actresses."
4,Better than earlier editions,"It has always bothered me than earlier editions of this guide (as opposed to its leading competitor _DVD and Video Guide_ by Martin and Porter) never had a directors' index. Finally, they have included one. (They even put a disclaimer that this is merely an index of the directors of films included in the book, not a complete listing of all films by a given director. Was this why such a necessary index was omitted before, that it doesn't list all of a director's films?)It's a little worrisome to me that a well-known film critic can put his name to a book series without a directors' index. I guess this book is just another income stream for Mr. Maltin. Consider the Martin guide, instead."
4,Jason & Trucks,"The story I read about was about trucks. I practically love trucks myself, their one of my favorite vehicles besides old hotrods...This story had all kinds of trucks which do different jobs such as the logging truck, it carries logs to places. I liked the big monster truck...Trucks come in different sizes and shapes. They can do all kinds of jobs including farm work, help carry building materials, deliver mail for the postal service, and fire fighters use trucks to put out fires.This book was as good book but it left out a truck, a pickup truck. This truck book was a good book other than the pickup truck they left out."
4,[A 12-year old's] thoughts,This book is about all kinds of big earth rumbling trucks. It showes them and thier jobs. On each page thier is a diffrent truck. Each truck has its own important job that it does.
4,Fairy Tale Album??,"Once upon a time, Joey surfed on to [the web]hoping to find the best cover album ever. He happened to stumble across ""Punk Goes Metal"" and gave it a disapproving glance, thinking to himself ""The eighties were horrible. Come on! Look at these artists! I've never seen them on MTV!"" Since Billy's birthday was coming up, Joey decided to buy it for him for a joke. When the CD finally came, Joey gave it to Billy and forced him to pop it in his stereo at once, all the while thinking they'd have a great laugh about it. The first song came on and suddenly Joey realized that this CD was actually good. In fact, this CD was very good. These bands took songs he thought [were bad]and made them great. Billy on the other hand loved the eighties, and he was impressed at how these songs he thought were perfect could actually be improved! By the end on the CD, both Joey and Billy were singing along and having a wonderful time, and they lived happily ever after."
2,Punk Goes Poseur Metal,"It is too bad that the makers of this album did not choose REAL metal songs to sing. (Like songs from Slayer, Pantera, Bloodbath, Dying Fetus, Bolt Thrower, Ministry or at least early Metallica) They choose phony, overproduced corporate garbage hair metal songs. I can see why so many punk rockers hate metal. They think metal is about some jackass in spandex with an annoyingly high voice who is so detatched from reality and lives in a mansion in Beverly Hills. Probably the only good part is that AFI doesn't sound like Guns N' Poseurs, or maybe that Divit doesn't sound like Judass Priest (which was really a cheap and corny imitation of Black Sabbath)"
5,Almost Perfect,I purchased this toaster to replace my previous T-fal Avante that finally gave up after many years of service. The only thing I don't like about this particular model is it didn't have the frozen setting. I can live without that but my last T-fal spoiled me. It comes as avertised though and everything it should do works as expected if not better.
2,Toaster,I thought I had done adequate study before buying what one would think should not be so difficult a purchase. First day- the toast traveled about the kitchen before landing on the floor--- awful design!! does not toast even and just plain sucks.
1,Is medication the problem,Are you kidding me. The seller of this item needs there medication adjusted. Come on people $500.00 for this toaster. This must be a mis-print.
3,beautiful book on silent films,"This is a wonderful book for the fabulous colour and black and white photos, but there are errors in the text. The information is general and nothing new or enlightening."
2,Niel Sinyard is a master at writing books like these.,"But this is no CLASSIC MOVIE COMEDIANS. And it can't hold a small candle to Brownlow's THE PARADE'S GONE BY... either. However, if you are a fan of silent movies you may enjoy some of the coshured information about classics, but this is a turgid and flawed effort."
3,"Gale, Not Gales","Don't confuse Eric Gale with Eric Gales. Gale (no ""s"") died in 1994 when Gales (with ""s"") was 20 years old. Aside from his solo albums Gale was best known for his guitar work on Bob James and Grover Washington, Jr.'s albums in the 1970s and on Paul Simon's ""One Trick Pony"" album from 1980. he can be seen playing with Simon's band in the film of the same name."
5,ERIC GALES ROCKS!!,"Yeah, you'll probably hear that he sounds like Hendrix or Stevie Ray, so what!! Don't let that stop you from enjoying disc. This guy rips! There are so many juicy riffs here and Eric gets a killer sound from his guitar. My favorites are CHANGES IN EMOTION, PIECE OF MY SOUL, FED UP WITH YOU, RESURRECTION and HIGH ANXIETY.FED UP WITH YOU is some ballsy, high powered blues. The 3 man format works very well here. Crank this sucker up and let Eric Gales blow your socks off!! This is what power trio rock is supposed to be.[...]"
3,Kernal Seasonings,"Since popcorn is my snack of choice, I thought this product would give me a little variety.The label says to sprinkle it in the bag of popped corn. Well, that only takes it to the bottom of the bag!!!! So, I use the same method as when I sprinkle parmasean cheese on my corn. I empty the bag of popped corn in a big bowl, spray it with olive oil cooking spray (what I coat my cooking pans with) and then sprinkle the parasean on the corn. The spray helps the cheese to adhere to the corn. It also works with the Kernel Seasonings, except that I do it in half bag batches (1/2 of the corn in the bowl, spray, sprinkle and then the second half of corn."
5,Fun!,"This is Walt Disney's version of ""The Little Mermaid"". It follows the animated movie. However, this small book is told by Sebastian the Crab's point-of-view.***** If you have readers in your family that are ready to go a step above the ""beginner's"" stage, then this book is just PERFECT. It has colorful pages that help bring the story to life and fire up the imagination. It would make an excellent birthday or Christmas present for young girls. *****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."
5,Amazing Artistic Achievement!,"I absolutely love this CD; the textures abound with ""Circles"", Dirty Second Hand"", and ""4:12"". Lyrically, it is one of their best; how can you not love ""You've one life left to leave"" from Faust, Midas and Myself"". The double meaning is rich and thought provoking.Must be experienced through headphones first.Strongly recommended!"
2,Oh Gravity Shoots Straight Down,"The Beautiful Letdown was fresh and new. Nothing Is Sound hit you even harder with some fresh sounds and inspiring lyrics (mostly, some of the songs on there were a little dry). This album is a little too ""hard rock"" for my taste. In addition to that, the lyrics aren't as relevant as there were on the last two albums. It's fall 2008, and I am just now giving this album a full listen, because nothing on it really captured my ears when I gave it a run through when it came out. EPIC FAIL!"
3,One Great Track,"""Faust, Midas and Myself"" is beautiful, absolutely brilliant. Worth buying the cd for, if you can get it for 5 bucks or less. A couple of other tracks (""Circles"", ""Head Over Heels"") aren't bad. The rest are pretty average and forgettable.Is it important that they are a Christian rock band ? No. I didn't even know they were until I came on here to see reviews and write my own. Who bloody cares what faith (or not) a group has, providing they write good music. Religion has been the excuse for more wars, more death and greater destruction than anything else mankind has done."
1,When you spend,"When you spend 16 bucks on a album. You hope for something more then 1 good song. Well with Switchfoot's album that is it.I am sad because I have been a longtime fan, and this album was really bad. I also heard they lost their record deal with columbia and I hate to think that this could be the last release by switchfoot."
2,Major disappointment,"Listened to it 2 or 3 times, but probably not ever again. Lame is the only word that comes to mind."
5,Switchfoot's best CD yet!,"I've always enjoyed Switchfoot as a band, yet in the past, every CD of theirs had at least one or two songs that I really loved, some that I was okay with, and a few that I tended to skip over. This has to be the first CD by Switchfoot that is great from start to finish! They were close to hitting a home run with ""Nothing is Sound,"" but they weren't quite there yet. ""Oh! Gravity"" is right on the money. Switchfoot adds to their edgier material from their previous release, giving their songs even more depth and maturity. At the same time, some songs, such as 4:12 and Secondhand Lovers, bring back fond memories of their first release, ""Legend of Chin."" ""Singability"" is at an all-time high--songs like the title track, American Dream, and Head Over Heals have great choruses that you can't help but sing along with. As owner of all their previous work, I can honestly say that this is the best investment in Switchfoot material that I've made in years."
4,"Good album, continuing the hits.","This is another good album from Switchfoot. Unfortunately in the omaha area, the song ""oh! Gravity"" has not been played on the stations I listen to, so this album snuck up on me for release. Its good, but I honestly like the last album Nothing is Sound a bit more, a little more rock edge. This album is solid, but nothing that seems groundbreaking for them, although it is a good continuation of their sound. Much more of a poppy feel in my book. I don't here the big air play singles on this album Like ""dare you to move"", ""meant to live"", or ""stars"". Still a great album to get, available at a major electric discount stores with 2 bonus tracks and a bonus download."
3,"Great music, weak lyrics","I love Switchfoot, but like so many bands that start out with that amazing innocence and fresh approach that sounds amazing and smacks us with enlightening lyrics, they seem to have compromised in this album. As one reviewer said, he didn't even know they were a Christian band. I have to say I probably wouldn't know either from this album. The music is great, but what message is this getting out? Even the video, while fun, really is pointless, not even a glimpse of the hope we have in God's love.While I don't believe every song of a Christian band has to have a blatant message, I do expect that on every album there will be at least one song stating what the band stands for. I'm sad because they used to have such a great message ""Christ is the answer"". Now they seem to have lost it."
3,Average effort from Switchfoot,"I would have to say this album is average at best. I will say though, if you ever get a chance to see Switchfoot live do it. They are incredible in concert."
3,A not-so-beautiful letdown,"Some revewers and critics have said that this is a comeback for Switchfoot after ""Nothing is Sound."" My personal opinion is that it is another step further away from what made Switchfoot good in ""The Beautiful Letdown."" First of all, the music is less ""musical."" It is more noisey with less melody. A good example of this is the title track and ""Dirty Second Hands."" It seems that John foreman and the rest were more concerned with taking things in a new direction than creating plain old good music. Some tracks suffer frome being excessively experimental and bizare (good examples are ""Amature Lovers"" and ""Faust, Midas, and Myself""). Thanfully, the album does have some songs that are more down-to-earth like ""Awakening"" and ""Head Over Heels."" All in all, the CD is not a total waste, but it isn't very strong as a whole."
3,Pretty good but not as good as Beautiful Letdown,"Good cd, at least 1/2 the songs are good, but like some other reviewers, about 1/2 pretty forgettable. They definitely missed the mark with the title track, Oh! Gravity. I try and try to listen and get in to but its always, ah just okay. Anyway, if your a fan its a good cd to have in your collection, just lower your expectations and you'll be fine."
4,Still sounds great...,"Ten years on and this CD still sounds great. I would like to add to previous comments that ""Tank Park Salute"" is simply a crushingly moving song. I bought this CD in '91 and that song would bring me to tears at times. It's a beautiful song. I also love ""Cindy of a Thousand Lives"" because it's so different from any song out there. I was fortunate to see Bragg in concert here in Atlanta on this tour and Michael Stipe came out to sing with him. His CD's translate so well in a live venue. This is my favorite Bragg CD with full production, but I still would say ""Talking With The Taxman"" is his pinnacle."
2,"AFTER ""WORKER'S PLAYTIME"", THIS FALLS SHORT.","I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS ALBUM. MOST OF THE SONGS ARE FORCED AND TEDIOUS. THERE ARE A FEW GOOD ONES LIKE ""YOU WOKE UP MY NEIBOURHOOD"" WITH R.E.M.'S MICHAEL STIPE AND ""SEXUALITY"" WHICH HE PUTS A PUNCH INTO THE LYRICS (""I LOOK LIKE ROBERT DENIRO, I DRIVE A MITSUBISHI ZERO""....ON SESSIONS AT WEST 54TH, HE CHANGED THE LAST LINE SINCE MISTUBISHI DOESNT SELL THE ZERO IN THE STATES). THE REST OF THE SONGS ARE LACKING (""GOD'S FOOTBALLER"" SUCKS BAD). I KNOW HE CAN AND HAS DONE BETTER. BUY ""WORKERS PLAYTIME"" AND SIT BACK AND ENJOY THE BEST ALBUM EVER PUT OUT ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH."
4,Bunch of books in one,"A bunch of books in one as we see the turbulent litigation of the 60s and 70s from an insider's point of view, then the growth of Human Rights Watch and the important work done in Central America and elsewhere to George Soros' occasionally transformational efforts in former Soviet countries. Refreshingly honest, such as the part where Neier admits that the ACLU's mental health litigation asking for the mentally ill to be released from institutions unwittingly contributed to the homeless crises which continues to this day. I have never heard a liberal admit this, though it is probably true (it's important to admit mistakes to avoid them in the future). The book would have been better with more about Neier's personal life and his personal feelings about triumphs and defeats, but all in all a great insider view of civil liberties litigation, NGO politics, and human rights strategy."
5,Saved me from headaches reading in the sun:),I recently bought The BookShade and took it on a trip to Hilton Head South Carolina to relax in the sun read. The BookShade worked great! The BookShade stopped the suns glare and I never got a headache as I did in the past straining my eye's in the sun.Thank you
4,Great Idea,I received this item as a gift and I love it. It was easy to use and blocked the sun so I could enjoy my book. Highly recommended.
3,"""Practically"" useless ...","This book could have been useful, except for one (enormous) drawback. There is no documentation for any of its ""facts."" Oops! Kind of a large blunder, wouldn't you say? After I discovered this ""fact"" I found the book to be ""practically"" useless.In all fairness, the book addresses some very interesting topics."
1,Creationism....Now? Yeah..and Earth is flat!,"A manipulation with wider ordience,intended just to enrich authors pocket.Every provincial curator of naturalistic museum knows all contraarguments. Study Bible carefully and you will find enormous contradiction.Stage has been reached in our understanding of universe historical development that rejects this claims in toto.I am afraid that scienctist are too seclusive and ultraspecialist kind of people,and they are loosing ground to Creationists fictions.What more evidence do those people need in order to perceive reality as it is?"
3,they are ok...,"These baskets are ok, but they shed bits of wood(?) that are splinter-like, and this could be dangerous with little kids/animals. However they do hold a lot, and the outsides look attractive."
1,"""His Story"" should be listed under feminist studies.","Mann's linking of society's ills to the patriarchal world displays a gross ignorance of history and anthropology, two fields in which he claims expertise. Feminist revisionist historians will love his deluded fantasies. If you're male and interested in accurate historical analysis, don't waste your money!"
4,Not bad!,"I don't usually read 'relationship' books. I generally find them to be cliche'-ridden and draining. I almost put the book down but decided to stick it out because I was curious to meet Daphne, the girl with the 'shadowy secrets.' The minute Daphne entered the scene I was hooked. I'm talking cooking-with-one-hand-and-reading-with-the-other kind of hooked. It was the battle of...the playa versus the gentleman. It was thrilling being inside the mind of a man and I often found myself saying loudly to my husband, ""So THAT'S how it happens!""Kudos to Tervalon for a job well done."
3,A Man And His Women,"Read about college instructor Jordan and his relationships with three women - Mary, Trisha, and Daphne. The story focuses mainly on the Jordan/Trisha/Daphne triangle, with Daphne giving Jordan all the trouble he needs. A pretty good find. It's short, so you can finish it rather quickly."
5,A mouse worth having,"It was everything I expected, since it's my second one. Plug in and start using! That simple. Very comfortable in my hand. Love the ""back"" button on the side."
3,good and a half,"DJ Logic is one of those whose albums I want when I see his name. I have both the dance retro-riot ofThe Anomalyand the experimentalProject Logic. Both are remarkable.Zen of Logic is not, which does not make it bad by any measure. This album explores more conventional hip and trip hop grooves. DJ Logic, master he is, does this well.But what I loved about the other two albums is the odd source material Logic choose to work with, breathing new life into old forms and making classic albums. There is nothing wrong, intrinsically, with him wanting to work with newer forms, but while he does this well, there is no angle to make his take on the music compelling.If you like the other albums, this is worth getting. If you have and love this, you have just GOT to get the other two-because you ain't heard nothin' yet"
4,Misleading description!,"This CD does not have the cover tracks listed in the description. It is the PROUD CD with 2 extra tracks to the tune of 50.00 bucks....totally not worth it. I was very dissapointed with that...the music on the CD is great of course, but the description itself that is presented in the AMAZON. COM listing suggested another 18 songs which ARE NOT THERE. The extra songs would justify the price. Someone needs to review these things before posting them."
1,Wake Up Amazon We need a CORRECTION !,People do not buy this album until the error on this itemhas been corrected the album does not match the description.Even as an import it should not cost $50.00. I Really Lovethe Artist but this is hurting her album sales. I hope this willbe corrected soon I would like to see what tracks are actually on the import.
2,It depends on what you want from this book,"I wanted to find out how Muslim women in the USA live their religion. For me, therefore, I didn't want to only hear from Muslim feminists rallying for their cause. I wanted to also hear from American Muslim women who were satisfied with the way they lived their religion here in the USA and what they liked about their religion and why Christianity didn't seem fitting for them. I didn't get that. And many of the chapters simply seemed like ""rah, rah, let's change this and that!"" It was like going to a political rally for one side. I didn't feel like I learned a heck of a lot."
4,American Muslim Women Testimonies,"Essays and poems by women born in America and raised as Muslims. Telling their stories and how they are forging a current identity as Muslims in a modern western secular setting. Many thoughtful ideas on viable Islamic adaptations that reject traditional cultural limitations and abuse of women found in some Islamic cultures. Patriotic, spiritual and dynamic women dealing with the realities facing them, and their positive interpretations of Quranic faith as a liberating force in their lives. This volume will provide rewarding insights into Islam. These essays are not somebody's unconsidered opinion about Islam and how it affects women. This is a set of personal testimonies of Muslim Women. This is the real deal - not just the negative, but the positive. See and learn of here of personal faith, not about a religion."
2,Didn't care for it!,"I understand the need for Muslimahs in America to tell their personal stories and I respect that. However, I was very distrubed by many of the stories I read. I am left wondering, if people want to change Islam to suit their personal perspectives and desires then what will be left of this way of life? I realize people have different applications of Islam but how can one justify sex outside of marriage, marrying a non-Muslim man, or being gay?? The Quran is CLEAR in its position on these matters. How can some of these authors expect people to see it any different? I totally support women praying in the same hall as men (separated), serving on the masjid boards, and taking a stand against sexist norms that have been interpreted as ""Islam"". But a woman trying to be an imam? Praying in mixed gender rows? I think that's taking things too far..."
5,More fun than a litter of kittens!,"I am familiar with Mr. Lester's work, so when I found this CD, I had to get a copy. It is delightful. The wealth of music about cats is amazing! I played Copland's Cat and Mouse in a recital many years ago. I had no clue there were so many other cat tunes out there. The Cat duet that closes the CD is very funny. Zez Confrey's Kitten on the Keys rings so true - if you know cats.Please don't let the ""cute"" idea behind this CD make you think the compositions or the performances are second rate. Nothing here is second rate. Noel Lester is a true artist and I admire his skill. The voices are full and rich. Even the short snippets of poetry work beautifully and I ordinarily don't like spoken word combined with my music. All the spoken word bits are very short, less than 25 seconds.You will enjoy the playfulness and artistry of this CD. Look for more music from Mr. Lester. He is an American treasure."
5,Outstanding!,"I can't say how much I enjoyed this movie! I laughed out loud several times, jumped a few times too. The writing is smart and very well paced. I loved how the characters reacted to the insanity happening to them. I kept thinking this sounds like my firends and I if we were caught in a similar situation. This film is funny, smart, terriically shot and i am sooooooo glad I bought this film. Totally worth the dime and totally worth the time."
4,Very Funny,"Any movie that makes me laugh is worth recommending to others. It's a take-off from other horror movies, such as previously mentioned, with a humorous twist that works. The trailer pretty much nails it. You won't be disappointed."
5,"Funny/Scary, Good Movie, Love the Characters",This was a great movie my family and I loved it. We laughed at some of the scenes we jumped at some of the scenes it was fantastic.
5,this is a great book!!!!!!!,"This is the only book on pumping I believe, it is the best book I have ever read. It really helped me, when I needed it the most. When I had my baby I was told I would be able to breastfeed and my heart broke, this was the one thing I wanted to get right (right for me), my labor and delivery didn't go as planed, and then neither did breast breastfeed. The nurses told me to pump to relive pressure, but not to pump too much and I would dry up. When I asked if I would pump and give it in bottles they said I could but that it wasn't worth the time. It was worth my time, This book helped show that I wasn't alone and helped me find support. If you are trying to breastfeed and are thinking about pumping BUY THIS BOOK it saved me, my pump, and gave my baby breast milk"
2,Oversimplistic book for practitioners,"This book is good for laypersons who are keen to learn about their injuries and about how to approach their clinicians but not so good for the practitioners. It lacks sufficient coverage. There is hardly any coverage of vascular injuries, the main problem of neck injuries. The airway injuries is also insufficiently covered. I hope it improves with time."
2,Not for beginners,"This book is full of in-depth information on Audition and it's many functions and is worded in plain english that will make sense to anyone already familar with Audio work. Unfortunately, its not structured for a beginner. It progresses in a manner consistent with the program but not in a logical manner from start to finish, which is what a first time user needs to be able to grasp the basic concepts of using the program from scratch."
5,power of a praying woman,The packing was great and the item was as expected. I have not started reasing this yet but I am excited to get to reading it.
5,The Power of a Praying Woman,"My Methodist Women's group is studying this book and we love it so much that we are taking it one chapter at a time. It has taken two years so far because we do one chapter a month but each chapter is so filled with great advise and inspiration that we don't want to speed through the book. Some have said that since it will take us three years to get through the book, we should just start it all over again. :)"
4,"Not his best, but fun nevertheless","Here's the thing. If you go into this book expecting the scope and depth and wild imagination of, say, Steel Beach, you're going to be disappointed. If what you're looking for instead is a fun, entertaining, fast-reading story featuring a little time travel, a little romance, a couple of interesting plot twists, an eccentric multi-billionaire, and, yup, mammoths, then, hey, here you go! It isn't profound or groundbreaking or destined to be a classic of the genre. But, as I can personally testify, it is a fine way to pass the time on a boring night shift."
2,Would have made a great short story,"To be fair the only other thing I've read by the author was his short story Press Enter_ which I found in a Hugo Award compliation several years ago.Since I loved Press Enter_ I had high expectations for Mammoth. Mammoth just didn't deliver. I think if the author had cut out a lot of the fluff this could have made a great short story. There was just too much fluff left in to make a great novel. Also, I think that if you're going to write a novel about time travel that you should make *some* attempt to explain where the time machine came from. Maybe you can get away with it in a short story but I expect more from a novel.I did like the twist at the end though."
1,Varley is 5 Stars; Mammoth is Not,"You can read the boilerplate to figure out the gist of the story, no sense in me wasting your time with a rehash.I am astounded and in awe of John Varley's imagination.John Varley is one of the best writers/SF writers I have ever read.John Varley is absolutely world class. I rank him with Howard Waldrop and Ted Sturgeon, among few others.""Mammoth"" is flat and, although I loyally read through to the end, tedious. It ranks right down there with ""Red Thunder."" A spark of imagination, coupled with cut-out characters and a ""see it coming around the bend"" twist at the end do not combine to enthrall.Do buy ""The John Varley Reader."" Be amazed by brilliance. Pray that John Varley has only fallen asleep, and will someday awake, and return to writing the stories that have dazzled me for the last twenty-five years.And do buy everything else by John Varley save ""Mammoth/Red Thunder."" Best money you ever spent."
3,This Mammoth is a Little Shaggy,"Although an enjoyable 'pot-boiler'-type adventure story, this novel is not really up to Varley's standards. The characters are too extraordinary: the world's richest man, the world's most beautiful actress, the world's best mathematician and a circus performer who also happens to be the leading expert on elephants. The concept of time travel is not fully worked out: the paradoxes are left unexplored, the mechanism is left unexplained, and the chunk of earth sent time-traveling changes size with each occurrence. The plot has some pleasant twists but also a fair amount of gaping holes (which I won't describe -- those who have already read it will know what they are).In short, I enjoyed the journey but there were a few too many places along the trail where the reader's attention is drawn away from the story being told. Because this is John Varley, I expected a bit more."
3,pretty good,"it's good without the time travelling element really. I never imagined mammoths as being like this, of course I have to rememeber that it is fiction."
3,"Loved it, but...","I loved this book, but I felt a little disappointed in it too. Varley's characters live and breathe for me, and thus I can't help but be interested in what they're doing. ""Mammoth"" kinda came apart for me when Susan revealed her great plan, which left me thinking ""and this is a good idea exactly why, please, I understand why you want to, but how will anything be better, what are you thinking anyway, please 'splain.""I find it annoyingly vague when stories don't specify What Really Happened and leave the readers to decide for themselves what was Real and what was Imaginary. Perhaps this is an artistic authorial technique and I just don't underestand or enjoy it because I'd prefer to have major plot points all laid out for me. So it bothered me that ""Mammoth's"" text never actually refers to the Building of the Time Machine.However, all that said, still: it's a John Varley book. Yay! Another hardcover to live on my shelves forever."
2,Varley wimps out,"Mammoth is a quick and easy read, perhaps working as simple weekend entertainment. As a pulp sf/action novel, it has a lot in common with Michael Crichton novels. For many, that would suffice, but I found Mammoth to be disappointing. There is very little hard science here: the physics and philosophy of time travel are completely lacking, for example, supplanted by Rubik's cube hand-waving magic. Paleontology is discussed at a level that might be expected from a children's museum; part of the story (that part that contains most of the paleontological information) is, in fact, written literally at that level. But most disappointing is Varley taking consistently wimpy stances on the paradoxes of time travel, the corrupting influence of big business, science vs religion, and especially the rights (or not) of animals. Mammoth provided a very good framework for Varley to take a stand on these issues, but he takes the middle ground, placating in every instance."
2,Too Predictable,"Spoiler alert.This started out as a good, fun book. And I generally enjoyed it. But two big things bothered me about it. First, the chapters are numbered by time sequence. The book starts with Chapter 5, then continues in order until a time jump back to chapters 2-4. Then there is another skip to the current time (Chapter 16). It's around this part of the book that the reader realizes the book is going to end with Chapter 1. Not only that, but the who/what/when/where of Chapter 1 is obvious. Varley does throw in a twist at the end with one of those Ws. But the other 3 Ws are as predicted.The other problem with the book is that a big chunk of the middle is tedious and not as fun to read as the rest.Overall, a decent book. Some good things, some bad. But knowing the ending ahead of time is not enjoyable."
5,Fantastic time travel story,"A really solid, exciting time travel story. It redeems (and makes fun of) the flaws in Millenium by the same author."
4,Would have rated 5 but......,"Actually an excellent book all around with a novel plot line, that tied time travel and a special mammoth together extremely well. The character development is good and Varley has you "" in their heads"" and feeling either for them or building a dislike against them. They come alive.The only reason I did not rate this book at 5 stars was that the well constructed and most satisfying ending was telegraphed a little too early for my tastes. Varley has made me a fan."
5,Riveting,"Mammoth is absolutely riveting. Beginning with the opening page, I simply couldn't tear myself away from this amazing tale.The story is about a mammoth's corpse which is found sheltering the body of a man with a time machine. It's fascinating, absolutely fascinating, and continually challenges the mind. The protagonist is a super genius, which may account for the massive headache I now have (though that could also be from reading for 6-8 hours straight without wearing my contact). Without offering too many spoilers, I'll just say the book had a little bit of everything I love (drama, mystery, sci-fi, etc.), including a lot of surprises. The ending was completely satisfying, too. And I loved the little intersticials, particularly given how they turned out in the end of the book."
5,A pass around book,"EXCELLENT book. Won't review it, you can read that anywhere. Purchased it for my husband and he passed it on to me who enjoyed it greatly. Next it's going to our son and then our daughter and son-in-law. Varley is a good writer. Enjoyed The Varley Reader also. Good sci-fiction read for all readers."
3,Not For Guitar Enthusiasts,"Muriel Anderson is unquestionably a great guitarist. If you love her music, this is a great audio dvd. The unfortunate part of this Blu-ray disc is that the video format adds absolutely nothing to her performance. I was really hoping to see more of her playing, with closeups of her hands, however the shots of her are mostly close-ups of her face. The majority of the rest of the disc is amateur stock footage of animals and landscapes (camera shake, bad zooming and complete lack of good composition and storytelling). As for the audio quality, it's good, but not brilliant. My PS3 with all of the latest updates as of May 08, 2008, can't play back the 5.1 track. I get an unsupported format error. I'm really hoping that Muriel puts out a complete concert footage Blu-ray disc, as I really do appreciate her obvious talent."
2,cant sleep? put this on.,"I just sold my copy on ebay, So i did actually own this hd dvd. Unlike so many fake reviews. First off, The sound and video is awesome.Real reference quality. But it really doesnt hold up to repeated viewings. Shes really kinda hot, Almost like a young carly simon.Great guitar player too.The songs themselves are pretty bland.Which is a shame.The background videos are nothing special. Your better off putting on the planet earth hd dvd with pat metheny in the background. Now thats cool............"
5,Love for the performance.,"Muriel Anderson is an incredibly talented artist. Being able to see her songs performed live, and being able to watch it on Blu-ray disc was a lot of fun. I love this DVD, I'd recommend getting it to watch when feeling really relaxed!"
2,"bland music, boring imagery","First I'll say that Ms. Andersen is a fine musician, but that is not enough to be entertaining. The music was mostly soothing in a Yanni sort of way, but the pieces all blended together. Occasional nature scenes are shown, but for the most part we see Muriel playing the guitar (there is no singing.) While this would probably be fine as background music while conversing with a friend in a bar or cafe, it is quite boring when your attention is focused on it. Picture quality is good, but then again there is not much to look at. Sound is good as well, but this will only be appreciated by those who like this style of music. This one is not even worht renting in my opinion."
1,"No Eye Candy, Visually Disappointing","I will preface that I do not claim to specifically be a Muriel Anderson fan, but I do like soothing guitar music, and was excited with the idea of having it combined with the visual beauty of nature. I am a huge fan of Discovery HD Sunrise Earth. This DVD fell completely flat of my expectations. (Which, no doubt, could be fixed by a more accurate description). This is an HD DVD of Muriel Anderson on stage performing, with the camera rarely showing anything other than her face or her hands, and almost subliminal flickers of nature scenes thrown in a such a scant and rare fashion that I cannot think why they even bothered other than to provide the misguided hook that caught me. If you want to look at Muriel up close in HD for long stretches, you will love this. If your expectations are anything otherwise, you may just try downloading or buying the audio (which is pleasant, but not dynamic), and playing Discovery HD in the background."
1,bulky face of watch,"Face of watch appeared much larger than the photo online. otherwise, worked fine."
1,Dont buy this !,"This watch is junk. I bought it for my husband who likes to have the light so he can check the time at night, well that stopped working 2 weeks after he got it, and two days later the whole thing stopped working the display died. . We changed the batteries, and it still didnt work. This has been the worst purchase I have ever made. Dont waste your money."
4,Alternative 80's throwback with some edge,What a great album. Every track seems to conjure up memories of great songs from the past but with a present-day edge. Combine The Cure from the 80's and the modern-day band The Killers and you have a lot of what these songs sound like.This one will be on my playlist for the forseeable future.
3,See these guys live!,"I first saw this band live at a festival show in Minneapolis in 2008 (note they're a LA band and play mostly on the West Coast), which then prompted me to buy this album. The album actually plays a little flatter than they did live, which is a little disappointing, but not totally unexpected. Had they captured the same energy in the studio that they project while on stage, this album would be a slam dunk. It's still a fun listen, with some great vocals, it's just not an album I play when trying to get pumped up (like in the gym, or before heading out on the town). I'm pretty sure it's their first full-length album, so I expect bigger things from them on album #2."
5,My kind of music,Reviews requires 20 words. I'm not a detail reviewer--either I like it or I don't. This is my kind of music and that is all I have to say. If that is not good enough I won't be doing further reviews even though I understand that is important for some sellers to continue a relationship with Amazon.
4,A Tribute To Thrash Gods,"All I have to say about this album is that it f-ing rocks. Many have come from all genres of metal, from the scathing Luciferion to the melodic In Flames, to pay homage to a time when Metallica was Metallica. Many new names pop up here, including Exmortem and Sarcazm. I've never hear of either group, but I hope they will be big. In short, if you are a Metallica fan, this is a must have. If you are an Alternica fan, stay away, for it will ravage you."
2,Very weak.,"This is not a good album. The lead vocalist who sings Master of puppets really sounds amateurish. He does not know how to sing metal. Although there are some sweet times, they can not save this cd. If you want good tribute to the great metal bands, try ""Nativity in black"" or ""Masters of Misery"". They are all for Black Sabbath. It is shame I can not find any good tribute to Metallica."
4,i like it,"on that price i can say it ok, i think im happy about it, not exactly what i expect, but still happy. thanks to the seller"
4,Nice Item,"I bought the seat covers for my 1997 Jetta. They fit the seats almost perfectly, were easy to put on, and look great."
2,Poor Quality Rolling Pin,"Rolling pin wasn't sanded and had rough edges on the handles as well as the roller so I had to sand it to use it. One handle was assembled crooked, which makes rolling feel unbalanced, kind of like a car with a flat tire. The ball bearings worked okay. I wouldn't purchase this rolling pin again. What can you expect....it's made in China."
1,Classic movie Musicals: 20 movies DVD,I would waste your money. There are like 2-3 good movies the rest are not interesting or even what I would consider musicals. The movies are poor quality and not remastered so they are bad viewing. Save your money and invest in better a better DVD.
5,FUN!,"Great collection, lots more variety than the cover shows. The review that says Fred is not representative of the collection is correct."
3,Mom enjoyed this DVD quite a lot!,"Mom's memory is not so good, but she does still enjoy singing and dancing movies and enjoyed this more than the usual movies on TV."
2,Not my idea of classic,"Unless ""classic"" just means old. I do love old movies and when I had TV I watched a lot of old movies. I also love musicals, but I was sorely disappointed with this collection. There are 4 discs of movies in the package and of all the so-called classics, I had only heard of or previously seen 4 of them. I suppose this is not a terribly bad value for the price, but I already have ""Royal Wedding"" on another disc featuring Fred Astaire, and I wouldn't have purchased this set just to get the Dorsey Brothers film. I think this set would be a good buy for students of Black History in the Arts."
3,NOT THE BEST SELECTION,"Would have liked to see some better versions of the musicals. Lots of ""forgotten"", boring movies that left me wondering why I bought this package."
4,A great B'day treat for my 84 year old mother.,"Great fun for the whole family to watch with my Mother. Lots of memories, and laughs from the lack of modern techno, but amazing staging and sound."
1,D and C movies at best,"I would not waste my money on this HORRIBLE compilation of B&W movies with very bad cinematography, acting and story lines. I thought I was getting mostly Fred Astaire musicals instead of movies I never heard of. These are movies no one would watch and if it wasn't so much trouble, I would send it back!"
2,Eh,"This is worth checking out if you're new to Ashtanga Yoga. She goes pretty slow and tries to explain what she's doing but I wouldn't recommend it for practice. Also, she only goes through half of the standing poses so you're kind of left wanting more when she decides to quit on you. I recommend Ashtanga Yoga: The Primary Series with Richard Freeman. The production value obviously isn't going to be as high as Gaiam but what it lacks in aesthetics it more than makes up with instruction. So all in all I say this is something good to rent but it will outlive its usefulness rather quickly."
2,"I'm not sure who found this more boring, me or the instructor","Beginners is definitely a misnomer here, unless it's just referring to an introduction to ashtanga. I am an intermediate yoga practitioner and I wouldn't wish this video on a yoga newbie. While you can turn on a pose explaination track, no modifications are shown on the main track. The instructor honestly seemed bored; her voice was about as excitement filled as Ben Stein's in Ferris Bueller. You know... ""Bueller? Bueller?"" The pacing of this is so slow I wanted to start counting sheep, but it manages to not feel relaxing at all. The sequencing seemed uninspired, and I grew quickly bored."
2,"Im chanting ""nooooooo""","I was really put off by the chanting, I guess mostly because the cover of the box did not tell me this was a chanting yoga video. I also found the instructor's approach to be distracting and annoying. But mostly, it was the chanting."
2,The voice!,"The session has its points, namely the explanation of the poses, as some of the other reviewers have stated. But I cannot get past her annoying, grating voice! I have not been able to actually complete a workout: not because of the difficulty of the poses, but because of that voice. ""Monotone"" doesn't begin do justice! I must admit, I'm somewhat sensitive to this issue, being a professional singer and voice teacher. However, the number of other reviewers who mentioned this distraction leads me to believe that this is something that Ms. Doane should adjust in future tapings. Again, her ""interview voice"" was perfectly pleasant. This was my first purchase of a Nicki Doane yoga video; it would take a notice that she has revamped her instructional delivery, and at least an audio preview to entice me to purchase another."
2,Nails on a Chalkboard,"I found it impossible to get past the voice of this instructor, which is equivalent to nails on a chalkboard, and the fact that she just talks too much. The workout in and of itself is okay for beginners but I would never purchase another DVD with this instructor!"
2,Watched once then tossed,"This is a very disappointing DVD. I was looking for a beginner tape - something easy. This is not it. It repeats each exercise endlessly and assumes that you can do all the poses without offering alternatives if you can't, for example, reach the floor with your hands while standing straight. Not a keeper."
1,Buyer beware!,"I bought the first DVD in this series, Doane's Ashtanga Yoga: Introductory Poses. I thought it gave a great introduction to the Ashtanga system, taking you through suryanamaskar A and B and several standing poses. I bought the second DVD, Beginner's workout. It is the EXACT same practice. There is nothing new. Doane goes through the same standing poses as on the first DVD. I find that to be incredibly un-yogic of the people at Gaiam, just a way for them to get more money from unsuspecting customers who get no clue from the descriptions of the two DVDs that they are actually the same.Do not buy this. I plan to write to Gaiam as well to complain about this."
1,Only for someone who has *never* done astanga,"What a letdown. I have done a lot of astanga, but bought the ""beginners"" DVD because I am not terribly flexible and have had some injuries. According to the box, it's a 1 hour, 40 minute program, which would be a normal time to get through the entire astanga first series poses. But in reality, only 55 minutes of this DVD is poses, and she only gets through some of the standing poses -- at a glacial pace. I felt like I'd barely gotten warmed up, and she was laying down for sivasana. I do not recommend this DVD unless you have literally never done an astanga series."
1,"Is ""terrible"" a strong enough word?","This is the worst yoga video I have seen to date. Nicki Doane's voice is awful to have to listen to. Fifteen minutes into the workout, her voice just seemed to grate my nerves. Her voice also just seemed to have a tension behind it, which caused stress. The workout wasn't terrible in itself, so I suggest memorizing the sequences and doing them without the video.This supposedly is a beginner's video. But there is no information on using yoga props, and no warning about not trying to reach the full pose right away, so as not to injure yourself. There is the option of watching the video with extra pose hints, but they are not very helpful. I would have expected more on how to make sure that you are properly aligned, or doing it properly.I would strongly recommend a different video. I wish I would have rented it before I bought it."
2,Do not waste your money,"I have done Ashtanga many times at the yoga center - but it would be nice to save the $15 per session and be able to do it at home. Especially, since Ashatanga is the same every time.Well, this DVD didn't help me out much at all. It doesn't go through the whole routine. It doesn't follow the Ashtanga breathing. And her voice is annoying! I have turned the volume way down and it is still grating.The workout itself is actually not too bad. It is strenous in parts because she goes through A and B many times and very slowly. However, as an Ashtanga workout - it really fails miserably.For the workout it is - it could have been improved with a pose-only narration track.Save your money, there are better DVDs out there."
1,Bulky and unpredictable,"The unusual design may be pleasing to look at but it is bulky and not practical to use. Temperature setting is totally unreliable, you have to ""pop out and check"". My toaster just died after 14 months and frankly I will not miss it !"
3,"So far, so good.",So far the toaster is working fine. Just have to get used to the settings. I use it on # 2 setting and its been fine.
1,Great toaster if you want black or undertoasted bread!,"We bought the toaster because we liked the look and because there was an overall favorable view of it here. Once we got it home, we discovered it was great at toasting the bread to blackness... or not really toasted at all! We went through an entire loaf of bread to find the right spot to place the dial, and we found that it went from one click made it not toasted at all (not enough to make it more stiff than a regular piece of bread) or blackened to inedibility if we went to the next setting from that!On top of the problem with it not working, it takes up WAAAAAAAY too much space on the counter, and the mechanism it uses to hold the bread in the toaster often keeps the bread from going down all the way.Bottom line: We bought a toaster that is too big and requires us to sit and watch the bread and pop it up manually or we get a burned piece of bread. Not effective on any level."
1,Should have sent it back,I purchased this about a year ago. I have been threatening to take it back ever since. I kept giving it another chance. It does not toast it only burns. It is not easy to take in and out of the cupboard and too big for the counter. The flip out basket does not always work. Big waste of money.
1,I was the only thing toasted,"I was suckered into buying this toaster by the loads of 5 Star recommendations. I plugged it in and could see right away that the heating wires were faulty. My toast is all patchy; snow white in some patches on one side and burnt to a crisp in some places on the other side. I will now have to waste a lot of time returning it to the manufacturer. I don't even want a new one back. I want my money back. I would never buy another one and I recommend that others avoid the product. Shame on T-Fals's quality control for letting faulty product off the assembly line. A 30 second test would have detected the issue - but they didn't test it and I own the problem and they have my money . . . . not a good trade. I will never buy one of their products ever again, and I curse their name every time I use the miserable toaster. Avoid it."
2,BEHEMOTH TOASTER---BE PREPARED,NO DOUBT YOU HAVE READ ALL THE TECHNICAL REVIEWS.ACTUAL USE IS THAT IT IS A VERY FAST HOT TOASTER. YOU WILL BE PLEASED WITH THE TIME IT TAKES TO TOAST ANYTHING.HOWEVER IT TOASTS UNEVENLY.THE INITIAL PICTURES APPEARED THAT IT IS A UNIQUE DESIGN BUT MANAGEABLE SIZE. BUT THE PINK ELEPHANT IS THAT IT IS HUGE AND APPEARS TO OVERTAKE ALL OTHER APPLIANCES IN THE KITCHEN.YOU MAY HAVE NIGHTMARES OF THIS GARGANTUAN 4 SLICER. IT SCARES ME EVERY TIME I GO INTO THE KITCHEN. I FEEL LIKE I HAVE ENTERED INTO THE TWILIGHT ZONE.
4,It's bigger than I expected,"I like it, it is fast and easy to use. I just wish it was bit smaller since I don't have much counter space. The price is pretty good, considering free shipping."
3,"Nice toaster, but a little big","This is a nice toaster, but physically it is a bit large. If I didn't mail order it I would have exchanged it for something smaller. It does a nice job toasting frozen bread so now I'm probabaly stuck with it for the next 10 years till it breaks."
2,disappointed,had a t fal toaster for about 12 years until it died. thought i would play the odds and buy another t fal. This one not as good does not do the taost as well first time have to put it through again. Why can't they make a toaster that works ????
1,HOW EMBARASSING !,"GAVE TOASTER AS A GIFT FOR XMAS...ARRIVED WITH BROKEN PLASTIC BASE...LOOKS LIKE IT WAS USED OR RETURNED BEFORE BUT I ASKED & PAID FOR NEW !! THIS SUCKS BIG TIME, WHAT A HASSLE.. LAST TIME I BUY ON LINE ! PAID SIX BUCKS FOR GIFT WRAP THEY STUFFED IT IN SOME CRAPPY BAG..LIKE YOU CAN'T EVEN WRAP A LITTLE TOASTER.....LAME...HOW EMBARASSING"
3,Disappointed!,"My Stepdaughter has one of these however, it's over 10 years old. That's why we bought one. Her toaster works great, fast and even toasting. Ours is not as well made or as sturdy as hers. The darkness controls are a little sloppy and one side of the toast is always darker than the other. It does a nice job on bagels the sliced side nicely toasted and the outside warmed. Looks like a Maserati drives like a Fiat. I think the product quality has taken a nose dive since my stepdaughter's toaster manufactured 10 years ago. Like most things today this product was ""Made In China"". If I had to choose a toaster again it wouldn't be this one and hopefully made somewhere other than the orient."
4,Gives real toast,"While the Toaster does a fine job of making toast, it cannot handle large slices of bread. I do recommend this toaster."
1,Wish I hadn't tossed my old toaster...,"I bought this in March 2010 because our old toaster was so slow and the reviews were good on this one. Big mistake. It takes so long to toast and then, as others have mentioned, we get one-sided or spotty toasting. We would never buy another one. Unfortunately, I didn't complain soon enough and couldn't return it. Wish I had our old one back. As slow as it was, it was faster than this one.Nice looking machine, but that's about all."
1,No big stars here!!!,"Very disappointed. I wanted a toaster that was faster than my old one, able to handle larger items (i.e. bagels), and would be consistent. This one fails on all three.1 - its slower than a seven year itch2 - it does handle larger items ... but one side is broken already (i.e. does not lock down at all)3 - it makes darker toast when it is repeatedly usedBottom line - do not buy."
4,Different and Useful,"The angled slots are useful and easier than top loaders. The right pull pushes the bread up once toasted, I love this feature. The bagel toaster is handy as is the stop button. All of the buttons and pulls are easy and intuitively obvious, you don't need a degree to operate it. It looks interesting on my counter since it doesn't look like the typical toaster. I would have given 5 stars except for the fact that a large slice of bread doesn't fit all the way in, the slots could have been a bit larger. They are wide enough for fat bread. I really like this toaster so far."
4,Nice Toaster,The toaster is a very nice - functional toaster. I love the two extra levers you press to bring the bread/bagels up and away from the hot toaster. This saves burnt fingers. The toaster has an off button if you want to stop the toaster.Nothing negative to say. It is light and time will tell how well it lasts. But I am very happy with it. Also the company I purchased it from is very reputable.
3,Pretty Good,I have had this toaster for a few months now and my experience so far has been okay.It does a great job toasting bagels.Some of my bread slices seem too long for the toaster. It is a very square toaster.It looks nice on my counter.
4,just fine until it died,"Had this toaster for 5 years and it finally just stopped toasting for no discernible reason. Worked great all that time: even, relatively quick toasting of just about anything breaded you can think of, minimal mess, easy clean up, relatively handsome on the counter with no tarnishing or scratching. However, I think we'll go for a replacement that's a bit cheaper. Why pay more if it's only going to last a few years? My parents had the same toaster for 20 years, but maybe they just don't make things the way they used to. All in all, good toaster that I was happy with, just wish it had lasted longer."
4,Toaster Slots,I only gave it a 4 star because the slots are plenty wide enough for bagels E.T.C. the slots aren't long enough for some rye or oat bran loafs of bread. If the slots were about 1/2 inch longer the toaster would perfect. Jim
5,Great Toaster,Great toaster. Unique shape. Looks great on counter.Love the fact that I can pop the toast up so I don't burn my fingers!
4,T-Fal earns it's stars,"Every two years or so, we wear out our toaster and begin the process of researching another brand. We've never bought the same one twice and we usually purchase it through Amazon. It's easy to start with the quirks, so here they are:1. don't push down both handles on the side at once with any force, the toaster will flip forward. Not an issue now that I know.2. Options for defrost and bagel are only offered for the left side; not both. No biggie.Other than that, it's a good toaster that gets the job done fast. Build and fit feels more like a BMW than a Chevy, and it looks good on the counter, which matters, even if your not willing to admit it does."
3,"Toast pretty good , but not great","This toaster has only one problem, it does not toast evenly. It dam near burns the toast at the bottom (all the time)"
5,t-fal toaster,this toaster is grate.defrost works excellent the butte to remove toast is handy and the one to eject is just grate.Love it.
3,TOAST CHUCKER,"I had a real slow Black and Decker toaster. My kids got tired of me complaining so they bought me this one. It seems to be a little faster, but the angled design causes it to throw the toast on the floor. My wife is pretty clean, so I don't mind eating it off the floor, but if I was single and living like a single man, I would probably contract some deadly disease!"
1,Toaster runs wild,First week perfect toast and love the look of the toaster BUT once I throw away box & receipt etc it all went down hill. I started on #5 and was getting beautiful moist toast... I'm now toasting @ #2 and it's still coming up really dark dry and just awful. My advice don't ever throw away boxs or receipts maybe mine just has bad wiring alas after only 3 weeks it's to late to return for replacement.
3,Probably better than most,"Although they claim it's faster than other toasters, I don't think it is. The slot is not long enough for the larger bread on the market now. The slant angle of the surface is nice. The stop button is nice. It's a nice looking toaster. The lift button is necessary for short pieces like English muffins. Once in a while the bread will shoot right out at you when it pops up. This alone is worth the price of the toaster for the laugh it produces. It's negatives equal its positives and it's probably better than most other toasters."
2,Returned,"Used daily for over 2 months. It's being returned.PROS :- it toasts the bread- wide slotsCONS:- toast flies out of the toaster onto the floor almost every use (primary reason for return)- slots do not fit taller breads (see note below)- did not toast faster than our old 1100W toaster- very short electrical cord (typical with appliances these days)- hard to clean, crumbs stick to bottom of slot, very few end up in the crumb traysPERSONAL NOTES:- large, takes up a lot of counter space- we never tried the bagel function- Oroweat Russian Rye bread did not fit the slot"
3,Disappointing,I used this particular toaster at a beach rental house and was very impressed so as soon as I got home I ordered one. It seems to take forever to toast a bagel or piece of bread. Perhaps it is just this particular one and not conducive to the model.
1,Questionable Quality,"Bagel option on left side is nice, but right side broke shortly after purchase with only very limited use - consider others"
1,Looks pretty but a piece of crap,"I like how pretty this is and how it compliments the stainless steel look in my kitchen. However, it seems I am the only one who knows how to use it. Setting on 2 does not get the bread done and 3 burns it. I have to give each family member/friend a lesson on how to use it. Style wise I love it, performance wise okay but not as good as I had hoped.Update January 5, 2013: My toaster broke this morning. I used it yesterday morning and it was fine. I've never had a toaster that did not last several years. I had my doubts from day one. Would not recommend as I am pretty upset about it only lasting a little over one year after only being used about twice per week. Pretty bad!!!"
2,Do not buy!!,"I purchased this a few years ago. After wiping it down with a damp sponge the first time, all the black letters and numbers started coming off. I would say they were 50% gone after that one wipe with a damp sponge and no cleaning fluids as all. I now have a toaster that has no numbers or words on it as all... It doesn't toast very well either... Especially when you can't see the numbers to set the toast level.. I would never buy this toaster again. And I paid a lot more than this for it.."
4,Good and toasts fast,I have had this toaster for several years now. The reason I bought it was because I wanted a fast toaster so I didn't have to wait around in the morning for toast to cook. It is fast! Also I had returned another brand toaster because of uneven toasting. This one is not perfect in that department but is more even than a lot of them. Toast lifts out easily and controls work just fine. I would recommend it.
4,Love this toaster,The angle makes it easier for kids to reach toast.Fits in easily with the decor of the home. Toast evenly although it cannot fit some of the wider bread slices out there on the market (with some of my whole grain options a portion sticks out of the toaster )
2,T Fal Avante Deluxe Toaster,We bought this toaster because it was well reviewed. However it is just not doing the job. With a setting on 3 the bread white or rye is almost burnt on one side and hardly toasted on the other. If I put the setting on 4 one side is really burnt andthe other is brown. Can you help us? I would be glad to return it if you would send me another one. Any suggestions?Sandy and Les Leonettisandyles@zoominternet.net
4,Very Satisfied,"Happy with all of the options such as the bagel and defrost buttons. It is faster than my old toaster. looks good in my kitchen. I am glad that I spent a little more, this toaster is worth it."
4,T-Fal toaster,"This toaster is HUGE! Be prepared to make lots of room on your counter. However, it is worth it. We tried several others. Never knew a toaster could be such a complicated purchase. This one is simple to use. Love the lifters and the english muffins actually get toasted perfectly (crispy) on the first try. Had to toast them twice on the highest setting to get them crispy with our old toaster. The cuisinart we tried from Costco made stripes on the toast ranging from untoasted to brown to burnt, even on the low setting."
1,Uneven toasting-very disappointed,"I heavily researched toasters before purchasing this one and I am very disappointed. It doesnt toast one side at all and nearly scorches the other side. If you are looking to buy this one, you might want to keep on shopping."
1,T-Fal TT7461002 Avante 4 slice toaster,Did not function properly. Toasted more on one side than the other side. I returned the item.
4,This toaster rocks!,"I had a T-Fal Avante toaster before so this is my second. I bought one for my boyfriend, too. This is absolutely the best, top of the line toaster on the market today. Toasts perfectly every time, has wide enough slots for bigger slices or bagels, and the best thing about it is the little level that lifts the toast up out of the slots for easy retrieval without having to fish it out with a fork or something sharp that could cause electric shock. No burning of fingers."
2,Toaster That Never Made It!,"This toaster didn't last long enough to make an actual comment. After a few months it wasn't worth the space it took up on the counter.Thank you,The Anthony's"
1,Don't waste your money!,"I recommend NOT purchasing this toaster for several reasons. First, and most importantly, it did not toast BOTH sides of the bread. A slice of bread that is not square will not fit into the toaster. And last of all, a strange design problem keeps the bread from going completely down into the toaster. It has a wire cage that ""grips"" the bread and pulls it down. The gripping action doesn't allow the bread to fall completely into the toaster so only the bottow 2/3's of the bread toasted. Also, the unit is large and bulky, it takes up way too much space on the counter for just a 2 slice toaster. The only thing ""deluxe"" about it, was the price. Way too much money for such a lousy toaster. I sent it back."
2,Great Looking Toaster But Not Great Toast!,"I loved the slanted top of this toaster. It's large, rather tall but you wouldn't need to cover up this one. The extra lift handles work well on short bread. The bad news is - I toasted several pieces of Italion short thick bread. One piece always did not toast on one side and was quite white. When I turned up the level from about 3 1/2, it wanted to burn the other side.Looking at the wires, I can see an uneven heat or glo from some. It just doesn't toast well. Looks like the electric wires are not heating the same on both sides. My 10 year old toaster elements were fine but it didn't have the lift handles and I was constantly trying to pick out the toast. Ouch! hot! I bought another brand locally, a Cuisinart. Same thing, Both toasters are Made in China. Hmmm - Wonder if we need to do some manufacturing in the USA again."
1,Not Pleased,"I have returned the item, as it did not work properly; toast was done unevenly, and settings did not work at all. Sometimes a lower setting would result in dark toast, and a higher one with too light toast. Considering the price, it was quite a disappointment."
2,Only toasts one side,"We've had ours for about a year now. I like the features such as the button that instantly stops toasting. I frequently use that one as well as the lift-the-toast lever so it's easy to take the toast out. Biggest draw back is that the bread toasts a great deal more on the one side of the bread, as if it is always on a bagel setting. This would be very helpful if I only ate bagels, however, I usually toast bread and waffles in it. I've given up taking the toast out and flipping it over so that the other side gets browner. I just deal with one side being a lot less toasted.Also, once in awhile, our toast will fly out and onto the floor. When it starts doing this, I angle it away from the floor so it will land on the counter.I wanted to love this toaster, but I can't but I don't want to break down and buy another that may turn out bad too. So I will stick it out until this one dies."
3,Bad Outweighs the Good,"I was immediately intrigued by this design--nothing I've seen before changed a very long-standing toaster design. I like the features on this toaster VERY much. The design makes it easy to retrieve your toast and the booster knob is also a really great innovation--I use it every time. The one-side bagel feature is also appreciated and the Cancel button operation is the best I've seen. However, where it falls short, is on the actual toasting. It toasts one area more than others and it is rare to not need to go a second time--which ends up burning stuff half the time if I get ditracted. A setting of 3 means it has to go again and a setting of 4 usually ends up with burned spots. If I rated it separately, I'd give it a 5 star rating on design and features but only one star on actual toasting--and it is a toaster after all. Sorry but I wouldn't buy it again."
2,Disappointed,"I did a lot of reviews before I purchased this toaster and this seemed like the best bet. All negative reviews on all toasters are the same - uneven toasting, unable to get proper setting, etc. Well, that was the problem I had. It's a beautiful toaster, but I wasn't ready to try again. I sent it back, Amazon was GREAT about refunding the cost of the toaster, as well as most of the shipping charges to send it back. Really wanted the relationship to work."
3,not good enough,"I wish I liked this toaster better. I like the design and the the ability to lift out the smaller slices.Unfortunately anything other than the standard loaf bread does not properly fit. I often have to toast one end, turn the bread around and then toast the other. This leads to un evenly toasted bread."
2,Poorly designed filaments,"We've had this toaster for a little over a year now. I dislike it for one reason: The filaments (heating elements) are so whimpy that the bread dries out before it actually gets toasted. As far as longevity goes, the inside elements went belly-up just the other day. The ones on the outside of the slots still work. Not helpful."
3,Disapointed,"Perhaps I was expecting too much. I had a T-Fal toaster which was several years old and I had really liked it. When it got tempremental about toasting bread, I ordered another. The price was right, the color and the order came promptly.The instructions were too brief. There was nothing telling what side to use if I just had one slice. It works OK though not toasting as evenly as the old one. The toast is OK even when I toast just one slice and I do like the crumb tray better than the old one.Also, it is a bit wider and I don't like the fact that it takes up more space than the old one. I would buy it again, knowing what I know now but there is very little,if any, improvvement over the old one. Perhaps the company thought they had reached the point of perfection and I don't agree."
1,Great toaster and then just Poof,"So I got this toaster because I am in a wheelchair and the angle of the delivery allows me to get the toast out of the toaster from a low seated position, very nice. This toaster worked very well for about a year and a half when something went Poof, hissing steam poured out, then some smoke. I unplugged it, allowed it to cool down, and dropped it in the garbage. Toasters are one of those things not worth repairing but they should last a little longer than a year and a half, and I am not a big user of the toaster. If you buy this toaster, you might want to consider Amazon's replacement program."
2,Repaired with a paperclip,"Our toaster performed OK, but stopped functioning after about 18 months. Turned out there was a very thin metal rod, where pushing down the toast shut the electrical contacts. This was broken, very poor design. I bent up a paper clip, replaced the rod, and it works fine now. Don't you want to do this to your toaster?"
4,Tfal toaster,"Toaster is of good quality, nice appearance, desirable features.Is way too large for small-medium size counter spaces. The toaster is slow, not fast as advertised. Toast lift feature is helpful at times."
2,Disappointed,"After owning a T-Fal toaster and after reading most of the great reviews for this T-Fal toaster, I went ahead and ordered the 4-slice toaster. I was very disappointed in that it toasted well on one side and not the other. I find this common with many brands of toasters. I have returned the new T-Fal toaster. It might have just been my luck of the draw. In this day and age you'd think someone could produce an almost perfect toaster."
4,T-fal toaster,"love the toaster only one fault, when toasting one slice it tends to spring it out on to the counter"
1,Wear and tear shows way too soon,This toaster looked so nice when it was new. Since being put into use it has enough wobble of its internal grills that it will get jammed and the grates will not spread. I would have expected a lot more durability out of such a simple item.
2,toaster doesn't toast on one side of the inside slots.,I ordered this toaster because of the ratings. It certainly did not meet our expectations. If you put one slice of toast in the toaster throws it on the floor when done. Takes forever to toast!
2,This toaster is ENORMOUS!,I'm going to have to return this toaster. It is ENORMOUS! Might as well get a toaster oven.
2,Doesn't Toast Great,I have this toaster and while it looks nice on the counter it barely toasts bread enough at it's highest setting. Bagels usually take two passes.
1,Not like thier old toaster,"I had a very similar model of this toaster and loved it. It eventually died and I tried to find a close, if not exact, replacement. I wanted it to be angled, to have a lift feature and hold hand cut slices of bread from loaves that are a bit wider than standard.This one looks quite a lot like the original but is a pretty big lemon! Very short slice holders, doesn't toast evenly, the lift feature barely works - it short, it is nothing like their old model. So back it went, and I bought a very boring utilitarian one that is OK but will never cause me to be delighted with a toaster like the old Tefal one did."
2,does not toast evenly,the toast is only toasting on the inside. Many coils on outsides do not heat. very disappointed. workd okay for bagels with the bagel setting.
2,Avante Deluxe Toaster,"I was very happy at the beginning with this toaster, the design is great, the stainless steel looks awesome. But after toasting everyday during 2 years, one of the heating elements broke. And it's nearly impossible to repair..."
5,Stylish,Nice to have a toast pop up lever so I dont have to use a knife to pull out the toast. Also the button to stop the toasting is right in the center where it should be.
2,"Great features, uneven heating","After six months, the heating elements would glow on one side and the other side only 20% would glow. This uneven heating caused bread to be toasted more or less on one side. Contacted the distributor through Amazon, but never received a response."
2,Non toasting toaster,"We like both sides of our bread toasted and finding a toaster that does that is not an easy task. I read many reviews and finally settled on the T-Fal. When we took it out of the box I thought we were in trouble...it seemed to be cheaply made..no substance. However, we gave it a chance. We toasted a half of a loaf of bread and not once were both sides of the slice toasted. We tried different settings etc. So we put it back in the box and returned it. The good news..we hadn't thrown our old toaster away and, in addition, Amazon.com was very easy and efficient to deal with on the return. We have moved on to a Cuisinart that is working perfectly for us."
2,"good looking, somewhat amusing, but not a good buy","I have to admit that the great styling was the top reason that I selected this toaster. It also has an excellent pop up feature, and the reviews were very good. We had a previous T fal that was very good when it worked, but lost function of one side after 2 years, so I should have been more selective. This toaster is totally uneven in it's browning, and changes so we can't adapt to it's quirky toasting. The most annoying trait is that it will send lighter toast pieces flying in the air, crash landing on our kitchen floor; this is so humorous that we just live with it, especially our kids who think it is a fun feature to go airborne; my son actually caught a piece mid-arc once. We will keep the toaster, but would not recommend it to anyone else."
2,Uneven Toasting,"Sadly, each side of the four slots toasts VERY unevenly. The reason for this is the heating elements haven't been threaded and spaced properly. It's a quality control issue I've come to expect from Chinese products. We'll probably just live with it since I don't expect it to last more than a year or two.The design however is fantastic, which is why I'm giving it two stars instead of none. It takes up much space, yes, but it's a show stopper. I get more complements on this thing than my new Subzero. Also glad I followed another reviewer's advice and ordered black instead of white--agree completely.LESSON LEARNED: In the future, I will, no matter how painful, buy European. European manufacturing always leaves me amazed by its quality and indestructibility. This toaster is a beautiful piece of furniture. If only it had been assembled by a Swede."
2,Nice while it lasted,"It was a very nice, stylish toaster while it lasted. Days after the one year warranty expired, the tiny piece of cheap plastic fell into the crumb tray and it was over. I now have a two slice toaster - the plastic catch broke and the side with the defrost and bagel selections will no longer stay down. It was used sparingly and not abused in any way so I'm leary of buying this brand again."
3,Only toasts one side!,"I bot this toaster at Sams. Since they usually have top quality products at the cheapest price, I didn't shop around for the price. Unfortunately, Sam's was considerably more than purchasing it online. We needed a 4 slice toaster and I checked several places before settling on this one. From the beginning, it only toasted the inside half of each piece of bread. If you looked at it while it was heating, you could see that the outside wires never turned red. I returned it and got another one. I just plugged it in to check it out. One side worked properly, but the other side (the far left slot) only heated up on one side. I haven't decided whether to return it again, or just live with it. The first toaster was very slow to toast, also. I don't know about this one yet. If you set it above a 2, it burns. For the money, I think it's a rip-off. Wish I had bot the cheaper one at Wal-mart or Target."
2,toaster review,"I like this toaster ok- bought it to replace a previous model that just conked out. But this new model is a little to bulky and the dials are loose. I have a hard time setting the level of darkness- and the bottom burns while the top of the bread is normal. Seems to have uneven coils along the sides, or else the slant effect causes it. Sometimes the toasts flies out of the slots and onto the floor because of the slant. Kind of weird and probably will not buy another like it ever."
2,"Looks Great, Works Not So Much","Great looking toaster, unfortunately I had the same uneven toasting problem that many other people mention. Then it stopped working about a year later. Really not worth it."
3,Lasts only 6 years,I enjoyed my toaster for 6 years then the handle suddenly broke off. It has a one year warrrenty so I called the company and asked if I could get parts. They said no that I could send it in and let them repair it. I elected not to do that as it probably would cost more than I would want to pay for a 6 year old toaster.
1,Not worth the $$.,"I received this toaster as a gift in April of 2007. It is stylish and easy to use, but if the setting is not just right, it will burn toast very easily. It worked ok until today (January 2009) when it just died. Only comes with a 1 year limited warranty, so no hope of getting it replaced. For costing almost $50 I expected it to last longer than under 2 years, even with daily use."
3,"Good toaster, but large","It is a bit of an SUV amongst toasters and takes a good amount of counter space. In a world full of lot-filling MacMansions and SUVs - both of which I abhor - it fits right in, but in a normal kitchen it looks silly large, especially if you use it only once a week.It does the job well, although one side works better than the other, and I had to wiggle one of the moving racks a bit before it opened and closed properly, though not convincingly for'ever', so I keep an eye on that rack every time I use it."
5,Great Toaster,"This toaster is really great. It toasts evenly and quickly. I don't like the bagel setting though because it only toast one side of the bagel, but bagels toast fine on regular. The toaster looks nice in the kitchen too and is made well."
1,Great while it worked,Should a toaster last more than 2 years? My Gran's lasted decades. This one didn't. Now it wont stay down and thinks all bread you put in is already toasted. So getting a new one - needless to say it wont be a T-Fal.
1,"Pretty, but not long lasting","Perhaps I am expecting too much, as I have had this toaster for about 4 years. I have never been impressed with it's toasting. Only one side does the defrost/bagel option. I did however love what it looked like. The toasting has gotten worse over the years, as in uneven or one side of the toasting slots don't work at all. Now I'm down to one full slot and one half slot. Time for a new toaster, in which I will not be purchasing this one again."
3,TFal Toaster,This toaster toasts unevenly and has a very small crumb collection area. It is fast and has super easy access to the toasting slots. The lever to raise the toast makes burnt fingers a thing of the past. The stainless steel look exterior is difficult to keep free of fingerprints but looks great in todays modern kitchens.Overall I am pleased with this purchase.
3,NOT MADE IN THE USA,"We ordered this toaster specifically because the web told us it was made in the USA, it's not, it's made in China."
1,No Toast for You!,"Had an earlier version of this model and we loved it. This model was purchased in Sept 10 and it lasted until Feb 11 - WOW 6 whole months! Do we really live in such a disposable society? It worked great for 6 months and then one day completely stopped, just dropped dead out of nowhere. Tried taking it apart but no success. Once you get the housing off you can't go any further to see if a wire came undone or something else ridiculous. Very disappointed, feel like I have no options for return either. Is anything built well anymore? I really don't think so."
4,"Good toaster, nice appearance","I bought this toaster looking for something that toasted fast and actually popped up the toast when it was supposed to! As for toasting fast, I guess I was expecting miracles because I thought it would toast faster than it does...but it's still better than what I had! And it's very good on the customization factor, being able to choose exactly how dark you want it and popping the toast up when it's supposed to. The ""toast lift"" feature is very nice too so you don't have to risk your fingers digging into the toaster to get your food. Overall, a very nice toaster."
4,Cool Toaster,"We really like this toaster. We have a pantry off the kitchen where the small appliances reside and the design of this toaster works for us. It slants outward toward you and has a lever to push out big bagels etc. without getting electrocuted. That's a good thing. Also, gets alot of use as we have six kids."
3,T-Fal Toaster,I love the color and style....you need to have counter space as it is bigger than most. At times it will toast unevenly....so you have to check it. I have an older (about 7 yrs old) 2 slice T-fal that I love. This one doesn't compare as well as I had hoped for....but the features are great....love the cool touch sides.....bagel button....pop-up lever....and it toasts fast! Great for frozen waffles...no need to retoast....perfect bagel toaster. I would recomend it.
5,GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRREAT!!,This is the best toaster I have ever owned! For once I am finally able to have toast that is brown all over instead of on just half of each side. I reccomend this to anyone looking for a grrrrreat toaster!!
3,We have owned this toaster for 3 years and I am replacing it,"I bought this toaster 3 years ago. We have never been thrilled with it, it is NOT high speed. The toasting has never been even and the last few weeks it has been burning on one side. I dont know what the trouble is but I am replacing it. It just seems to take forever to toast and I am actually relieved to have an excuse to replace it with a new one. I checked consumer reports - they dont review them all but I am getting their highest rated toaster this time. I see on Amazon that the one I am buying also gets some bad reviews - I just do not see any that are consistantly rated good."
3,big beast,"Not a bad toaster, if your short of counter space, not the one you want, looks good pretty fast, just big for a 2 slice. An Amazone purchase."
2,Nothing Fast about this Toaster,"I bought this toaster because we wanted a 4 slice toaster and it was suppose to toast fast.Well, forget that! It takes longer than our old 2 slice toaster. Even if you only put 2slices in, it is still slow. There is also uneven toasting. It is however great for bagels.Even frozen bagels toast well. But you can only toast 1 bagel at a time."
1,China Quality,"I did not buy this through amazon rather Sam's club. 2 weeks later one side would stick and burn, 3 weeks later the auto stop button on same side stopped working. It works when it wants and burns what it can, awful product."
2,Dead Toaster,"This is the second toaster of this model I've owned. It was a pretty good toaster, in terms of getting the job done, but died after only nine months of light usage. The first one I owned lasted longer, maybe two years. Both showed no signs of problems, but simply stopped one working one day. I will be shipping this one back!"
2,Fine while it lasted,"When I first received this toaster, it worked just fine, although it is very large and takes up a lot of counter space. Within 6 weeks, though, 2 of the slots stopped working: the lever wouldn't stay down, so we couldn't use that side at all. When I contacted T-Fal about the problem, they said I could pay to ship the toaster to a little repair shop and it might be repaired. I chose not to do that because 1) shipping that giant toaster would cost about as much as buying a new toaster at Wal-Mart, and 2) I would have no toaster at all for an undetermined amount of time while they attempted to fix it. I kept it, and used it as the world's largest 2-slot toaster for 4 more months, until the remaining 2 slots also stopped working. Again T-Fal told me that I could pay to ship the toaster to a repair shop. Paying $60 for a toaster is not a good deal when it doesn't even last 6 months."
4,A real toaster,when shopping for a quality toaster the other reviews about this units size scared me a little. while it may be larger then most it is very sleek and we love it
1,Does not toast the whole slice,"I bought this toaster based on the favorable reviews and the attractive look in my kitchen. Well, it looks nice, but it does not toast a whole slice of bread -- only about 2/3 gets toasted, plus when toasting smaller pieces of bread, they fly out of the toaster and land somewhere on the counter when they are done."
2,Not so fast...,"I like many are still looking for the perfect toaster. I don't find this toaster to be any faster than any other toaster I've owned. The heating is uneven because the heating wire touches the mounting surface in some places and not in others so some parts glow red and others do not. The slot size is about a quarter inch shorter than some other units so full size, store bought sandwich bread doesn't really fit all that well. After several months one of the toast raise levers flew off and landed in the heating mechanism and partially melted. I'd have to send back the whole toaster to get it repaired... customer service was tedious. The angled forward slots are really no advantage in fact you just end up looking at crumbs. I'd look elseware for a quality toaster."
2,Floor Toast,"Length:: 0:09 MinsI know it's funny the first time you find your toast on the floor. This only happens in the left slot, as far as I have noticed. Will keep you posted."
4,Good......but,"I recently purchased this toaster from Amazon. It has all the basc features I need and does not require any reprogramming after power failures. Instead, there are push buttons for reheat and bagel modes. It toasts quickly and evenly, so to speak. Although each side of the bread gets nicely toasted, one side is significantly darker than the other. For example, I get lightly toasted bread on one side, and the other is medium. That is not a problem for me and my wife, but could be for fussy cooks/eaters. The other thing I want to point out is that this toaster has a large footprint compared to a lot of the others on the market. If you have limited counter space, this could be a Problem. I wish it had a button so I could set it to activate only one slot when I am toasting one slice of bread. It would be an energy saver."
1,"Built well, but does a poor job toasting",This unit is big but well built. The controls are easy to use and a pushbutton pops up the toast at any time. It even has separate handles that raise the toast to view it. However when it comes to toasting it fails miserably.If you have it set to brown the bread in the center it burns it on top. Set it to brown on top and it will be white in the middle. We went through a whole loaf of bread trying to fine tune it but finally gave up.I'm sending it back.
5,4-Sliced Wonder!,"This is my first 4-Slice Toaster, and I bought is based off of the other Amazon customer reviews here. I could not be happier with this toaster (unless it came with artificial intelligence)5 Star Toaster!!!"
5,Great Toaster,"Before I purchase a item, I check it out in Consumer Report and also what other people have said about the item. Its definitely a good toaster. It best to have your setting on low the first time you make toast. I'm 100% satisfied with the toaster."
3,t fal toaster,"I had one before,but this one is not made as good as the last one..handles are loose and the middle ones do not pop up.otherwise ok"
3,Brown & White,Great looking and easy to use but it doesn't brown very evenly - a common problem of toasters nowadays. I halve the time and flip the bread around.
4,nice toaster,"This toaster works very well. It's also much faster than the last one we had, which is nice. It is fairly large, which might be a consideration for someone without much counter space. The only problem I've had with it is that it sometimes ejects the bread completely out of the slot and onto the counter when it pops... I just try to remember to put my plate in front of it while it's toasting. But overall I'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others."
3,"looks nice, but...","Item looks great on the counter and it does work well enough to make toast, but...- it does pop the toast all the way out so it lands on the counter. Don't set the toaster too close to the edge, or your toast will be on the floor!- also, I read the reviews saying it's difficult to get it to toast both sides of a slice of bread to a nice golden brown and figured the reviewers just hadn't dialed in the adjustment properly, but it's true...the bread will be nice and brown on one side, and too light on the other.That being said, it looks nice, and it's good enough for me, but if you're picky about your toast being toasted on both sides, and care if it's thrown at you out on the counter, then this isn't the one for you."
2,Not long enough for bread,"They need to go measure bread. Most bread is 7 "" wide but this is not. Really disappointed as tfal is usually a great manufacturer"
4,Wonderful and deep story of the Sword Coast,"As a long time reader of each and every Forgotten Realms book, of late I have been disappointed with the quality of writting. Ed Greenwood's latest attempts with Elminster's tale have falled short of the mark Mel Odom's writting is both refeshing and very accurate to the history of the Sword Coast. What appeals to me is that fact that he does not try to squeeze too many things into one book. Or course knowing that he has 3 more to follow does help He does a very good job of taking 3 different ""quests"" and weave them into one. As a fan of the new Baldur's Gate CRPG, it was great to see cities and areas that I had just explored leap to life on the pages of his book A must read for any Forgotten Realms fan"
4,decent book,"I picked up this book because I was in the mood for a sea based adventure and in that respect it delivers. I kind of felt a love/ hate relationship for the two main characters. Jherek, the hero, is a mere boy who of course is destined to be an amazing hero who saves all of faerun (played out plot yawn) was annoyingly innocent. He did have my sympathy for his tendency to have bad luck. The other semi-villan Laaqueel a malenti (birth deformed saughin) was just plain annoying. The only thing she did through the whole book was pray to her god.It was a decent enough book just because I was in the mood for the particular setting. I even picked up the rest of the series that is were things went downhill."
4,At last a book with good fighting scenes,This is probebly the first book i read that has good fighting scenes not some boring all to long fighting scenes the worst thing in this book was the relationship between Sabyna and Jherekto much romance for my taste. But yet this book is one of the best i have ever read.I live in Icland so im sorry if my english is bad.
1,Way out there,"Albert Ayler-style free jazz, only with found sound effects and tape effects. It does not swing, it has no melody, and all of the selections sound much the same. This is a time travel period piece, and a real hoot for anyone familiar with his subsequent work.Not my cup of tea."
4,A sexy vampire film,"I was a fan of the original tale when I read it in high school and was looking forward to seeing the two movies based on the classic short story. Neither film, either the 1970's version with Glynis Johns or this one with Magenta Brooks, followed the story very closely so they must be judged on their own instead of as adaptations. The Johns movie is disappointing since it is neither scary nor sexy, however, the Brooks movie is both. Production values are very low and the sound and acting is just passable but the star, Magenta Brooks, is sexy, elegant and carries the film effortlessly. She wears her costumes with the grace of Sargent's ""Madame X"" and steals every scene she's in. Buy it just to see her.Mrs. Amworth"
1,Mrs. Amworth,Even for a B film this one is bad... it had potential but the lack of any real story line and the really bad sound killed it. In all fairness Ms Brooks was on the right track but unless you are a dyed in the wool aficionado it is not worth the current asking price.
2,Amateur Work,"Mrs. AmworthAn amateurish piece of work in every sense. Dialogue poorly written can't possibly be good acted. The lighting seems to come from old soap operas, where every set was flooded with light to save time on set ups. Just for vampire movie lovers to satisfy their curiosity, but don't expect much."
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen.,"This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen and I can usually find something redeemable in any movie I have watched. However, when it comes to Mrs. Amworth, I am at a loss to discover any reason that would compel anyone to watch it; other than they have a family member that had the misfortune to be associated with it. The cinematography, screen play and acting were all dismal. At one point I became slightly dizzy as the camera swung from one character's delivering their lines to the other. There is no way that it could be considered campy or even mildly amusing, it is just a very bad movie. Do not waste your time or money."
1,Not recommended,I don't like it because:It's uncomfortable to wear. I would go so far as to say it's painful to wear.The sound quality is poor; no stereo sound and it buzzes if there isn't a clear line of sight to the base unit.It's expensive for the poor quality of sound and the uncomfortable (and painful) listening experience.My recommendation:Get a wireless radio frequency (RF) unit with stereo and ample padding for your ears (Sennheiser is a good brand).
1,these are not what I hoped for,"I actually have these on right now and keep moving them around because they are so uncomfortable. The ear pieces are not adjustable, hard and in the wrong direction. When I move around there's just static.Off to research something with a great review so I can return these...."
2,Not all they're cracked up to be.,"I bought a set of these for my mom..the ""one-two year battery life"" is actually just about four months. And the battery ain't cheap, folks..they glued the two tiny hearing aid batteries in place in the case, making the battery ""assembly"" a proprietary part which sells for 20+ bucks plus shipping.Being a handy guy with a soldering iron, I replaced the batterys with a pair of off-the-shelf cells for under $4.00..Likewise, their ""ear buds"" (which are ungodly painful!) wear out/fall off, and sell for (you guessed it!) 20+ bucks a set plus shipping..way to prey on the senior citizens TV Ears!Two thumbs down for crappy design which is painful to old ears and ridiculously priced replacement parts, which is even more painful to fixed incomes."
3,tv ears,the hearing assist for tv works ok . they seem to be a litle cheaply made for the 90 buck I spent. They won't easily fit in the charger as you must position them perfectly.....they hurt my ears a little. I can't hear anyone else talking in the room............I wish for better quality for the money
1,No Customer Support,Bought this to go along with a new Toshiba LCD TV. I didn't realize when I purchased the TV that it has a digital optical sound connection. There is no place to hook up the 2 TV Ears rca jacks into that works. I called the customer service and left a voice mail. No human answers. Then I sent an email asking about a solution. This can't be the first TV with this problem. No reply after several days of waiting. Sending this back.
5,I no longer have to have the TV so loud even the dogs left the room,I put off getting them because of the cost. When they came they hurt my ears when I used them so I fixed that with a little thin foam and they are just great. I couldn't do with out them now. The sound is clear and very adjustable. My UPS man encouraged me to try them. They got here really fast and packaged to prevent breakage. I have tried other devices but nothing can compare to the TV Ears.
5,TV Ears,"I've been using TV Ears for almost two years, and they really do the trick. Very comfortable and easy to control tone and volume."
1,listen up,had them before. the wands eventually separate from the battery case. But this most recent model lasted only 2 months. and there is no one to repair it.
3,TV Ears do not last,"This is the 3rd pair of the ears I have owned. They work good until the plastic ear holder breaks. The first two pair broke within a year, but worked fine while they were whole. They are more comfortable to wear than muffs and provide good, clear sound, but they are much less durable."
4,"Thank you, thank you,","My husband is very hard of hearing and watching tv became unpleasant because. He had to turn the sound so high, e en with hearing aids. TVEars really has done the trick. He can now hear tv and I can listen at a lesser volume. My only complaint might be that the batter life is not great. You must recharge after e er use."
1,Garbage,Works good for a few months but they don't last 1 year. I've now gone through 2 of them. I give up. I will look for something else.
1,"It doesnt works, there is a lot of noise between receiver and transm.",There is any way to change frecuency? There is a lot of noise in the head set.
2,It's awful...,"So I get this in an effort to help my husband sleep while I watch TV late at night. On the second day, the foam ear cover popped off never to be replaced (although I did try and I'm usually good at this kind of thing). Inside the foam ear cover, the plastic knob has a sharp little nipple on it...so to put that side in my ear, I had to get a fingernail file and file down the protrusion. Now I have a foam cover on one side and the plastic ear piece on the other...ok at least the sound works. And then suddenly a month later, it didn't work. It's charged, it is connected right because it used to work but now all I get is static and a faint sound of what is on TV. I have to try and hear what they are saying through the white noise surrounding the sound.....oh, and try and read their lips as I watch the program. It's so much trouble and I spent so much money, I'll just try and sleep!"
2,tv ears need improvement,"tv ears need a lot of improvement. earpices fall off, and base charger only works saometimes"
2,Beware of this product,"The audio and electronics work well as advertised. However, they have ignored a serious mechanical weakness in the headset construction. I have owned 2-3 of these devices and twice now one of the arms on the headset has broken. Last time I bought a new one because their warranty/replacement/repair service is as bad as it can be. If it breaks, don't bother. Just buy a new one. The disgusting part of all this is the fact that the mechanical weakness could be obviated with a simple tweak at the factory, which the Chinese engineers would be more than happy to accommodate. They need to have installed a stress relief at the point of juncture of the arm and the base. It would be that simple. They could even charge another $5 for a 5-cent fix. So, it will probably work well for you for a year or so, but be prepared to junk it and buy a replacement soon thereafter."
1,Does not last,"Nice unit helped a lot with my father watching TV on the top of sound level, but biggest problem is - it lasted less than 5 months. We paid $99.00 for one. If you rich enough to pay for the unit each 5 month - go ahead and buy it."
1,TV EARS IS A RIP-OFF!!!!,"First I had problems fitting the headset ""just so"" in the cradle so it would charge correctly. Then I noticed that they became very uncomfortable in my ears after about 30 minutes. Finally, after months of a bad connection (where I had to tap the circuit in the bottom of the headset until I heard sound), my TV Ears suddenly ceased to function. Now all I hear is static when I switch it on. I wonder how often this has happened, because when I call 1-888-TV3EARS or their HELP # (866-611-9944), the greeting I get is ""MAILBOX IS FULL."" And I wouldn't be so foolish as to pay the company $99 (per their ""Lifetime Service Guarantee"") for a new TV Ears System--only to be faced with the same problem later on!"
1,An unwise purchase,"This system is a rip-off. I bought it for my mother who is bed-ridden and a stroke victim. After three months the transmitter started shorting out. I had to put cardboard in the cradle to make a connection. After another two months the charging cradle transmitter is practically worthless. It takes me about ten minutes fiddling with it to get one of the two two charging connections to engage. Most TV earphone sets are too cumbersome. They mess up my mother's hair and cause her cheekbones to ache. We are going to try the Sennheiser IS410 system which has gotten better reviews and does not cost much more. If you watch TV a lot and want a wireless system that works do not buy this one. The doctors who recommended it do not know what they're talking about. I recommend not buying a product reviewed by a doctor but by an electronics expert or someone like me who has tried one. Bad, really bad product."
1,"Be Careful - only analog connections, no digital connections","The manufacturer needs to update their marketing material especially the outside of the box that says ""compatiable with any TV"". This device only has analog connections for the ""audio output"" and no digital connections. With most metropolitan areas in the U.S., our city went all digital a few years ago and we have replaced all the TVs in our house with HDTVs (plasma and LED with only digital connections). I believe they sell converted boxes for another $25-$30 but for the $90 I already spent on this product, I expected it would work with my existing TVs."
2,Does Not Work very well,"This product is supposed to be a world class product, so I bought it. Whiel the signal os OK, the connector pin to the bsae (from where the headsets are recharged) do not seem to work very well. I have used it a couple of time (to my wife's pleasure) but gave up on waiting for it to recharge."
4,hearing better,I am enjoying my Tv Ears. They do exactly what is proclaimed. My wife has great hearing & now she can turn the TV down to her level.
2,A very limited product,"The product allows one to listen at a volume without disturbing others, and it's light weight. Then comes the shortcomings, namely, one can hear interference from AM radio; it's uncomfortable for long durations; and the product starts to fall apart after few weeks of use. A better wireless headphone I ended up buying costs four times as much. Bottom line, you get what you pay for."
1,TV Ears work poorly for me.,"My primary use was to be watching movies from Netflix. Most of these movies played on the DVD system do not put the full sound track out to the TV. Sometimes it is only the sound track. Mostly it is nothing. So mostly TV Ears do not work for me.TV shows do put the full sound track from the Cable box to the TV, so it works for this use."
1,Don't buy from The Natural Health Shope,"I had nothing but trouble when ordering from The Natural Health Shoppe. I was told several time that the item was ordered only to be called much later and told my card had been refused. When the store closes the phones are disconnected. I was disconnected, even though they had called me. There were charges to my credit card while telling me that my card had been denied. They had a new employee working who could not authorize credit cards and no supervisors on duty each time I called. The final straw was when they told me I would have to have a conference call with the credit company in order to get the item ordered. After being assured by the credit company that the charges could be taken off, I ordered from another company and had no trouble. I cannot rate the actual product since I have not yet received it. Just don't order from The Natural Health Shoppe."
3,NOT ENOUGH GOOD,"HEAD BAND IS NOT ADJUSTABLE, WITH ANY MOVEMENT COMES NOISY AND DISTORTED.SHOUD BE 5.6 mh .2.3 mh IS NOT GOOD ENOGH TO USE IT ."
2,Beware of Warranty!,"This product worked fine for about 4 months. Then it stopped. I called the TV Ears service center and they informed me that the base was not working properly since the 5 lights on the bottom of it were not illuminated. They said that since it was no longer in warranty - which is 3 months - I would have to buy a new base for $40 plus $8 shipping. I was told that the new base comes with a '5 year limited warranty' - I can only imagine how limited -and was made in the United States unlike the one that came with the original purchase. I asked why it didn't come with a base made in the United States in the first place and was told that they really didn't know why. I can guess the answer - they wouldn't be making money, hand over fist, replacing the bases a month after the warranty expires."

1,Total disappointment,"I purchased thru Amazon two sets and they worked satisfactorily for about one year, even though ONE OF THEM had very little use. They both failed almost simultaneously. I ordered a new headset (to replace one to which I broke its earplugs)and a battery pack for for the other one. But none worked.I had to throw away everything. I DO NOT RECOMMEND TV EARS TO NO ONE, BECAUSE THEY ARE BAD CHINA JUNK."
1,Junk,I purchased the TV ears and right after I got it home it would only work for a while then quit. I called the company and for them to send me a replacement part they made me give them another credit card to guarantee the return of the junk part. The tv ears worked long enough to go past the warranty date then quit working again a different problem. The concept works so find a good one from another manufacturer and stay away from this junk!
1,A cautionary Tale,"I bought these from Costco (and unfortunately tossed away the purchase slip when the TV Ears worked). They worked alright, for just two days, then quit. While they worked, I was quite happy since my hearing impairment is extreme. I thought that I would now be able to listen to TV and especially watch movies. From other reviews I see that there is serious quality control problem with this company. I would never bother with them again."
1,Junk,"Yep mine lasted only 6 months. A total waste of money. The batteries will not charge, it only works when plugged into the cradle."
5,Best Product EVER for hard of hearing people,"I bought this product for my grown son who is hard of hearing. The TV was always on full blast, now I can turn the TV sound down to save my hearing and he can still enjoy the programs we watch. My Mother also uses this product and she really enjoys being able to hear TV. GREAT PRODUCT!!!!"
2,Engineered Failire,"I have owned two(2) pair of these EARS, and neither had any TONE CONTROL. The first pair also broke the STEM off at the receiver. I sent the second set back for a refund, only to find someone who can apparently hear, to tell me that there is nothing wrong with the tone control. Well, I'm the one who bought the Ears because of the Tone Adjustment, because I have the problem and you don't. You turn a knob and see meter movement and tell me. I'll tell you that your EARS don't have enough ""TREBLE"" and that is YOUR problem, in that fact that your EARS will not be bought by me again.Oh, I didn't send the first set back because of the same kind of a story I just got about the TONE CONTROL.LK"
3,TV Ears for hard of hearing,"Setup problem with older type TV system was complicated and directions were not very specific. The range of tone adjustment is not sufficient for elderly with reduced high frequency hearing ability. Otherwise, it is great for watching TV with the sound muted or lowered so as not to bother others who may not wish to hear the programs."
2,Hearing impaired...,"The tone on these TV Ears doesn't adjust enough for my type of hearing loss.It has too much bass. Also, they didn't work on one of my TV's (only one audio out connection)without me having to buy an audio cord with a male connector on both ends. I passed them on to friends, though, and they just love them!"
2,No more TV Ears,"They worked great for about 6 months, suddenly have to sit very close to the transmitter to get decent sound. In that period of time I only used them about 2 dozen times. Have ordered new batteries, hopefully that will fix the problem but they have not arrived yet. The batteries cost $19.95 with another $10 for shipping. If I have to replace the batteries every 6 months then it can get quite expensive.I would not recommend this item to a friend.TV Ears 10341 2.3 System Wireless Headset System (Blue)"
2,Not a value.,"I purchase two of these for my elderly father who lives with us. I got two since the battery runs down.They work ok for a while. Foam bud covers come off too easily.He could not use them if he lived alone. Occasional static requires a hard reset of the base...The base is the worst part of the system. The headset does not easily rest in the correct position to charge. I though cordless phones in the 1980's but somehow TV ears decided to design a less effective connector. Heck, a jack would be better.the 'stethoscope' design is not very comfortable.I'm looking harder this time for a replacement."
4,Tv Ears a good choice.,"These are good for our families use. I use them at night when family is asleep.So cheaper earphones would work but these are wireless and sound quality to my liking. My husbands sometimes plays tv too loud and if he used then consistenly this would help. Just don't like exhorbitant cost of ear tip replacements and shipping. Rip off there. Our Dad 91 has 3 prs. one at his home, one at my sisters and one at his neighbors house. He now has hearing aids but can still use them on top to keep the tv silent while those who are not watching tv can do other activities."
3,"Lots of static, needs improvement",When we first go the TV Ears we had trouble getting them to fit tightly in the charger. We had to make sure the light was on to ensure they were being charged. Once we took care of that problem they worked well for approximately 9 months. Then they started to produce a static with any movements. As time went on they got worse with more static than not. We haven't figured out how to fix that problem. May have to buy some new ones and hope for the best. TV ears do need improvement but they are nice for people who can hear and don't want the volume loud.
1,TV Ears,I found this unacceptable for me as (1) The ear buds were too large and (2) Ididn't realize how limiting infra red is. I had to sit in one place and if Imoved my head the sound went away. I think FM would be more acceptable.
4,TV Ears are not a luxury...,"...they are a necessity. For aging boomers like me who have increasing difficulty with amplified sounds, they are indispensable for watching television. These are my second pair (the first wore out) and I use them every day. The tone adjustment doesn't seem to have a wide range, and it would be nice if the earphone batteries were a more common type - I must order them by mail - but these are minor annoyances. Great product!"
1,A really bad choice,When it works it is OK. Most of the time it doesn't work and requires unplugging for a few minutes then try again. The charging stand is poorly designed. It is very difficult to position the ears in the charging stand so they make contact.The TV ears are useless to me!
5,The best thing I've found,"These t.v. ears are phenomenal! I bought these for my dad who's hearing is not what it used to be. He's on oxygen continuously and the other devices I bought only magnified the air flow from his nasal cannula and not the t.v. sound. He is so happy with these because he hears the t.v. with total clarity and yet he can still hear someone speaking to him and he doesn't hear the oxygen at all! These are actually mini speakers and they are great! In fact, my mother tried out dad's and loved them too. She said she could hear so much better with them so we bought her a pair. The charging station/cradle has room for four pairs of t.v. ears and it's very handy. I recommend these to everyone, hearing problems or not!"
5,TV Ears to the Rescue,"Didn't realize how much of a program I was missing until I used the TV Ears. I can now walk around the room and still hear every bit of the program. Wife loves it, as now the TV sound can be set to her hearing level."
5,TV Ears Wireless Headphones,these are great. Saved my marriage as I had to have TV on so loud it hurt my wife's ears. I can watch my programs with the TV on mute so it doesn't bother anyone else!
1,Think twice ....,"I purchased this item for my father-in-law for a Holdiday Gift. He loved them! Then 4 months later the headset broke. I contacted TV Ears and paid over $40 for a replacement headset. Again, my father-in-law was happy. Lo and behold the headset broke again. I contacted TV Ears and again was told $40 something to get a replacement. Warranty is 90 days. I know a 75 year old man isn't like a 3 year old, so I can't blame him for them breaking twice. Don't buy this item unless you are willing to replace headsets at least twice a year!!"
4,My new set of ears,"The TV EARS work just great I no longer annoy my wife with high volume,the only reason it didn't give it 5 stars was because the ear pads are very hard on the ears and starts to hurt after the first half hour, wish they provided a little more padding."
2,Garbage...,"Purchased them so that I would not disturb the wife. They worked perfectly for about 6 months. They are not very comfortable and its rough having a device hanging from your face for an hour's worth of TV time. Then after six months, the battery cant hold a charge and you owe another 20-30 bucks to replace the battery. Mine are going in the trash can...."
1,Disappointed,"TV Ears 2.3 MHz System - Wireless Headphones - Complete SystemThis product has good volumn but sound is disappointing. I have been unable to get rid of the static in the background. I can hear the voices but that static in the background is annoying, and I am returning the product.Nini"
2,tv ears,"After receiving the order found it would not work on my tv without buying some additional ""kit"". I did not wish to do this so am returning it and don't know if it works or not."
1,Don't move too much,"If you turn your head, you may lose audio and get static. Make sure there is nothing blocking the transmitter. The charger interface never seems to connect to the earphones, so charging is a problem. They are very uncomfortable.. my ears get sore from wearing anything over 15 minutes. Sound quality is good if you can get the darn thing charged. A good idea, but poorly executed."
5,TV Ears...the best!,"This is one of the best gifts I ever bought. My mother is 80 years old with very limited hearing. She cannot tolerate the sound of the tv as the noise is distorted. So for years, my father has been reading the captions. For my dad's 87th birthday I got him the TV Ears. Now he can listen to the tv with the captions on. Everyone is happy! He is enjoying his news programs and sporting events. The headset is light weight and it is cordless and easy to manage. The TV Ears are truely a very useful product!"
3,Not from the show,"I thought this was the music from the show of the same name, but it's not. It's pleasant listening though."
2,8 days in my first belt broke!,"Bought our unit on sale for less than the little plastic one that we bought first. I give this tumbler two stars because it's much quieter than the toy machines. It just rumbles rather than rattling.I did this search because I just got home and noted the rumble was nothing but a HUM! I thought maybe somehow someone had caused the drum to come off the rollers but no - it was a broken drive belt. Looks like it broke in two places.Now, I see that this is common for these devices. Good Luck."
5,Great Tumbler!,"After the little toy tumbler my wife gave me for Xmas broke, I ordered this Chicago 3 lb. rotary rock tumbler. It has been working great,even when I overload it!"
4,Pete Engelhardt-style Ribbon Crasher...,"I've been a fan/player of the Engelhardt instruments since the 80's--ever since his Lens Drums were featured in ""Mexican Radio"" by Wall Of Voodoo, and ""Like Humans Do""by David Byrne. I just wish that his instruments were more widely available, and ingreater variety--I also miss the rough, natural patina of Pete's 1st generation pieces.As for this instrument, the 15"", It's treating me alright, but it's not as loud or lively as my 1st gen ribbon crasher, which is the smaller, 11"" size...I expected the 15"" to have a bigger, more aggressive sound than my old 11"". Perhaps I can jam something between the slats to achieve the desired effect..."
4,Is this all?,"Not bad. It is not just a purely war story. There is extra flesh on those bones, where we have a good description of the social struggles that parallel and drive the armed conflict. Some of the characters may indeed seem more real than others. It may well be that the authors spent more time expanding out some and just cursory attention to others.If you end up liking this book, the biggest problem may be that there are no sequels. In this future history of Pournelle's, he and his co-authors have done little in recent years. Perhaps it is because it posits as its starting point the CoDominium - an alliance between the US and the USSR. Since the latter imploded, this future history has become alternate future history. Maybe that is perceived by Pournelle or the publisher to have negative impact on future sales?"
5,the best,well thought out and covered the coming down fall of the u s followed by gobal .i guarentee within 12 months
4,cd,"bought for my husband he was looking online for a while , i dont remember this band but he likes it.."
4,Trompe le Monde,"Trompe le Monde being Pixies 4th and final studio album to date and was released in 1991. The album received good reviews and peaked at #7 on the UK album chart. The album had three singles, ""Planet of sound"", ""Head on"" and ""Letter to Memphis"". All the lyrics are included and we get a personnel list. The booklet is very odd and the theme with the eyes is a bit creepy. 4/5."
5,Truely amazing,"This album I beleive is the pixies second best although still truely amazing and pure talent at its best. This album is for any one who has only heard one track off any of their other albums and thought it was too light and soft then you HAVE to listen to this. With Umass and Sad Punk you'll be wishing you'd listened to them earlier. For a small number of Pixies fans could you please state why you hate this album so much, because I love it!"
5,Trompe le Monde isn't only the Pixies' best release...,"it's also the greatest rock album EVER. The myriad intracies of the title track, ""The Sad Punk"", and ""Space""... the base weirdness of ""UMass"", ""Subbacultcha"", and ""D=RxT""... and the blinding beauty of ""Alec Eiffel"", ""Letter to Memphis"", ""Bird Dream of the Olympus Mons"", and ""Motorway to Roswell""... make for a punk-pop masterpiece that is simply too sophisticated for most people to fully grasp and that nearly renders all other Pixies releases (save Surfer Rosa) obsolete. Take it from a toddler that knows."
5,"""Thank you. I comprehend, sir.""","The weirdness just kept on coming with the Pixies, and we kept on listening. This release marks a slight transition towards Frank's first solo outing. It is often underrated, simply because it's more ""out there"" in the sci-fi themes. Most Pixies fans didn't even know what ""Motorway to Roswell"" was all about until the recent anniversary, media bonanza, and teenybopper show on the subject. Frank sang about what interested him, and made no excuses for it. Confusing to casual listeners? Yes, hence the mocking title. But those of us on the same planet as him were singing right along, all the way home. ET phone home."
4,For all those that gave it the once over and gave up..,"I did too. Took me about 5 or 6 listens, months apart to get the hang of it. Contrary to most bands, this last album of theirs is possibly the most inaccesible. Its very harsh, seems to lack a certain spontenaety at first, but suddenly, like a chain on a bicycle that's been slipping, it suddenly clicks in, and boy, it rides like the wind. And what a trip. It'll make you nostalgic for those days when punk was inspired art, not Ramones wannabes. Farwell Frank, rest on your laurels, you did it. I give this four stars simply because nothing ever deserves five."
5,Not what you would like to hear,"While most seem to dismiss this album, I see it as their best. See, I didn't discover the Pixies until my Junior year in high school, and this was their newest. I listened to this again and again -- only discovering the older stuff a year or so later. While I adore all of the Pixies stuff and the bastard bands they became (amps, breeders, frank black, frank & the catholics, etc.), this record really hits home. I'm 25 now and own well over 500 CDs. THIS is the ONE disc that takes me back. (FWIW, I love ALL pixies discs, as well as their offspring, but this one really hits emotionally. your mileage may vary.)"
2,i'm the only one again?,i love doolittle surfer rose and come on pilgrim bossanova is an good album but not as great as the two mentioned but this my friends is appalling god could they make much more un-inspired noise i kno that's the trait of the pixies but for gods sake just a few guitars being plucked badly and frank black screeching with his balls in his throat god...no thanks there is one song i like plant of sound great riff the only great songall the rest are noiseget the albums mentioned above then a frank black solo album before this good point
2,Worst Pixies album,This album was a huge dissappointment. I saw the Pixies in concert three times and the last tour was as dissapointing as this album. After the brilliant Bossanova a good follow-up was obviously beyond their reach. The Pixies remain one of my all time favorite bands but I can't think of a single song on this record that is worth listening to.
1,i guess when you come out it's ok when you right artsy music,"random guitar plucks just like always, but it's talent because they pluck guitars like no other and squawk like birds in a microphone"
4,The best and final Pixies,"I've been listening to the Pixies since I was 12. They'll always be one of the best rock bands ever. Yes, ""Come on Pilgrim"" is the first release, and the rawest. Yes, ""Doolittle"" is probably considered the best Pixies album to date. ""Bossanova"" just rocks. Then, we have the final act.""Trompe Le Monde"" is a venture into a more produced, more ""sci-fi"" sound (Frank also took the sci-fi with him for his first 2 solo releases). It is frankly, for me, the best Pixies, or Frank Black writing ever released.This album is worth the money alone for the track ""Letter to Memphis"". If you've only got one Pixies album so far, this should be the next."
2,Aka 'A Fool and His Money'... not one of the best.,"A well-worn story about a marketing executive who starts a phoney religion only to discover that bilking people out of their money isn't worth the loss of his morals and his love. The actors all do a good job (including Sandra Bullock, in what I assume is an early role), but the elements of this film are just too tired to really make it worth the time it takes to watch."
5,Hell Yeah.,Back when he was just Cube's cousin. Look at him now. This album is still great. I remember when it first came out. Del the funky what? That's dope! This was the album to own back then and it's one you have to have in your collection now.
3,Where'd you get that Funk from?,"Del did not dig this album's vibe,but Ice Cube's heavy P-Funk sound carries over well from his 1991 classic Death Certificate onto this album. Del revolutionized the Northern Cali Underground with his second (and lyrically tighter) album, but this one contain a few choice cuts too like What is a Booty?, Mr. Dobalina and Same Ol Thang."
3,"Good, but just one thing...","Without a doubt you can state that Del is a gifted rapper and this cd is tight. He has a unique laid back style that i enjoy with some dope rhymes too, good beats, but there is one thing that i don't like about Del and that are his reocurring rhymes where he complains about how bad white people are. It's disappointing to hear that a supposedly clever lyricist still has such narrowminded views that he would come up with a chorus like ""Dark skin girls are better than light skinned, light skin girls ain't better than dark skinned"".If you don't care about that, or if you agree with him, than this is a great album. For me it was reason enough not to buy it."
4,Great CD,"It was a little off with those women in the background but this dude is definantly very Funky and he has a smooth flow and great lyrics. It is increddible that Ice Cubes cuz sounds so different then him. But there are some of Del's biggest hits here and he also has a good rap CD now with the Gorillaz as he finally gets some Mainstream recognition you would have thought he would recieve.""Mistadobolina""-""Mr.Bombay"" and the song about his couch are the best here. A Great CD that is worth a 4 1/2Lyrics 10 Production 9 Replay 8.5 Entertainment 9.5"
4,morning yoga,This video is exactly what I was expecting and will serve my purpose in the morning. I will use it daily to follow Dr. Oz's suggest of 7-10 minutes of yoga in the morning.
5,"coarse, wirey hair","I wasn't going to post a review but seeing that someone else has left a one star, I had to saying in it's defense.I only curl my hair during the summer because humid weather does a major frizz job on my hair. This iron curls my hair faster than my chi and hair comes out shiny, smooth and curled and stays that way till I wash it. The iron stays hot, I have burned myself a good many times on it. The cord is long and it swivels so you're not tangled up in it. The temperature dial varies from low (180) to high (200+). It monitors and keeps the desired temperature at all times. I had considered giving my iron to my hair stylist because I know she would enjoy it. But I like so much that it has stayed home even though I don't used it often.I haven't had problems with this iron or maybe I have not used it as much as the previous reviewer to have problems with it, but I like it and it serves it purpose."
1,"Worst, Most Overpriced Curling Iron Ever",Do not purchase. It breaks after 6 months and the company does not honor its warranty.
2,Doesn't grip well,"This would be a great iron if the clamp that clutches your hair was tighter and also seemTo heat up only to 210 , not enough for coarse hair,"
5,Required Reading for any MS Developer,"Great magazine. Covers the full range of .NET technologies. Every issue is packed with windows, web, and xml development articles plus industry news and a lot more. High recomended."
4,"Nice product, color not same as pictured","This hose cover is exactly what I needed. I was sick of seeing my wife drag the hose across our hardwood floors and seeing damage on our moldings. The unit shipped was a dark forest green, nearly black which I was ok with because it won't show dirt anytime soon. I installed the unit in all of about 90 seconds since it just zips on or unzips off. I would not buy a unit that wasn't zippered since I would have to wrestle with the hose to get it all the way on or off.There were some loose threads that I snipped but overall the quality is fine for what this product is. The zipper is hidden by some fabric to keep the zipper from dragging on your floors and doing any damage. It's made in China which I wish wasn't the case."
3,its too tight for the hose,The sock itself is so tight that the zipper keeps coming apart in areas along the length of the hose.
4,Zippered Hose Sock,The zippered hose sock fit perfectly with no issues regarding performance either. I will add that I was pleased with my purchase. Thank you
4,Does what is says,"This works perfectly, was put on VERY easily. The reason for only 4 stars instead of 5 - Not the same color as the picture would be my only downside to the product. It's a dark green color. Not a big deal when it comes to what it does, but I feel pictures of products should accurately reflect what is shipped."
3,Thunder on the Hills,A nice period black & white movie with a lot of long forgotten movie stars. Something the whole family can enjoy.
4,ULTRA PRODUCTS ULT31578 Deluxe Screw and Accessory Kit,"Its a nice little kit all the parts where there they just got all mixed up in shipping.My only problem with the kit is the case, parts like to jump and get mixed upIts perfect if you need the parts but not a good case to store them in"
2,Not as many of several parts as indicated,"When opening the package, I noticed that in shipping some of the parts had jumped from one cubbyhole to a neighboring one. I decided to sort them out and noticed that there didn't seem to be as many of some types of parts as indicated on the box.I started counting them and found out that this was the case. I counted the jumpers and the standoffs (didn't bother with the screws) and found that of the 4 types of parts I counted, each had between 10% and 20% fewer then listed.I'm not going to bother to return this, and normally I'd just write it off to poor quality control. But I noticed that in no case were there *more* than listed."
1,this kit is lacking,What are they thinking? This kit is lacking the right screws for computer installation. There was only 1 type of screw I could use. If you need them the ty raps were useful. I think I got screwed with this screw kit. They give you lots of stuff but most not useful. I'd rather spend mre to get the right screws than throw away lots of junk screws in this kit. If I could I would rate this 1/2 star.
4,"Does not contain flat/flush mount screw heads, but it's still a good mix.","Was needing some flat head type screws for mounting a floppy drive and discovered this kit had none. That's okay. Can get them someplace else. The kit does contain a wealth of other screws, tiny tie wraps, spacers, nuts, and peel and place spare feet (handy because my PC lost one of it's feet and is a bit wobbly). I would recommend buying it with the warning that the flat head type screws for flush mounting will have to be purchased separately."
1,Booooreeedommmmm,"I bought it because I figured that it would be a great way to learn the various poses, but it's so lifeless that I've never lasted past the first 15 minutes. Usually, when I do yoga, I feel refreshed, here you feel dulled. No, i don't expect Nickie Doane to be relentlessly cheery, but she's so grave that it's a killjoy. Less exciting than watching paint dry."
5,An excellent beginning,"I've taken a few yoga classes, but this tape really helped me ""get"" the sun salutations. The extra time in the different poses is tiring, but it really helped me get familiar with the sequence and gave me time to work at holding the positions correctly. By the end of this workout, my body feels tired, but I feel exhilirated. The production values are excellent, and Nicki Doane is a fantastic instructor. When I first heard her voice, I thought she sounded too stern, but after going through the workout, I found her voice perfect: very neutral but no-nonsense. She doesn't drown the workout in new-agey yammering---she talks only when it's relevant, and that helped me to really focus on the poses and to succeed in ""stilling"" my mind."
4,GREAT,I REALLY ENJOY THIS DVD ITS THE FIRST WORKOUT THAT HAS GOTTEN ME TO ACTUALLY WANT TO GET UP THE NEXT DAY AND DO IT. ITS SIMPLE YET DIFFICULT AT THE SAME TIME WHICH IS WHAT YOU WANT IF YOU WANT RESULTS. IM NOT QUITE READY FOR THE NEXT LEVEL YET BUT I WILL CONTINUE THE INTRO UNTIL I DO.
1,Another waste of $$,"All these videos are the same! Just with new music, and a new setting. I wish i could say I like it, but all it made me feel is depressed being in my own living room, while these rich people were in hawaii cause i bought there tape.If you already own one of their tapes, don't bother buying anymore. they're all the same.Waste of money."
4,Early 70's Smooth Stuff,"This stuff was played at basement parties on the East coast black in the day. Slow dancing or girl on top of the washing machine... you know what I mean. ""Love is remembered, after the wine, locks your heart, and intoxicates your mind."" (from Time Is Love) Music will never be that good again!"
4,If you're a fan of the Adagio--caveat emptor!,"First off a warning: if you came to Gayane via ""2001"" as I did--beware! Apparently the 1957 revision excluded Gayane's Adagio, and so does this recording. Which is why I gave this version 4 stars instead of 5. Fortunately thanks to computer technology I've been able to download the Adagio by itself and after ripping the CDs to my HD insert it where it belongs. Muuch better. Otherwise it's like ""Lakme"" without the Flower Duet. Otherwise otherwise, this is an xlnt recording of arguably the best Soviet ballet after ""Romeo & Juliet."" Which it ain't, nor is it ""Swan Lake"" so the orchestra plays it as it should be played: pedal to the metal and subtlety be damned. The recording is detailed and in your face if a bit shrill, fits the piece perfectly. Just be aware that if you play it at the level it requires, your ears are gonna be a-ringin' for awhile afterward."
5,The most comprehensive book on Visibroker for Java to date!,This book is by far the best handbook for any development tool I've ever read. I recommend it to anyone who has a vague interest in learning how to program with the VisiBroker for Java.
2,Formula&Average,While The Title cut with Joe Public was Bumping most of this Disc is So-So&Formula Driven.without Teddy Riley The Grooves&Vibe aren't as Strong.
2,Comin' With a 2.5!,"Keith Sweat's 1991 release didn't come off as the usual or other releases of his. For starters, Keith is mostly known for his bumping slow jams and he didn't let us down with the ones on here. As a matter of fact, that was the only thing that kept this one from being a total disaster. Once getting to track 6 with ""I Want To Love You Down"" the lp quickly prepares you for the whining and begging that makes him so popular. It couldn't have got any better with ""Give Me What I Want"" featuring Silk on background and taking the song to the next level of sexiness. Silk and Mr. Sweat invites you with ""The Ten Commandments Of Love"" with the background vocals saying, ""...come on, come on, come on, come on baby..."". Maybe this release would have been better if it was an entire Keith Sweat & Silk release."
1,Where is my stuff,I placed an order with you two weeks ago and I want to know where my stuff is!!!!!!!!!!!! Or give me my money back!!!!!!!!
3,Just As Good As The First Two,"Many music critics and fans felt that with Keep It Comin, that Mr. Sweat didn't leave up to the promise shown on his first two CD'S. In one aspect the up-tempo material wasn't as strong but the ballads including the I Want To Love You Down,There You Go Tellin Me No Again, and Give Me What I Want are all very good. The two up-tempo singles released from the album Why Me Baby and the self-titled track were also very good."
3,Neil Sedaka - The Definitive Collection,"This CD was not what I was expecting. I was hoping for these songs when he did them in his earlier years and not reccently. It is alright but, I would not purchase it again if something happened to it. I prefer the original sound tracks and not the ones they redo when they are older and their voice and arrangements have changed."
5,Neil Sedaka CD,I really enjoy the CD. I was kept informed during every step of the delivery process and appreciate your thoroughness. Thank you very much
1,wrong useless cd,The cd I received was Kenny G instead of Neil Sadaka. Also it would not play I tried it in 3 cd players
3,Not really definitive,"Be advised that the first half dozen tracks on this CD are re-recordings of Sedaka's 60's hits, and not the original versions."
2,Re-Recording Alert!!,"From the TV ad by Razor & Tie and Sedaka's own appearance plugging this CD on QVC, to the packaging itself, there are no indications that the RCA stuff are re-recordings. I should give the thing 1 star for deception alone. But the Rocket songs are the original's. What a missed opportunity this CD is. It could've been the first U.S. CD that combined Sedaka's RCA and Rocket hits. As it stands, this is only for Sedaka die-hard's."
1,What a Rip Off...,"I was very excited to be getting Neil's RCA hits and his 70's Rocket Records material on one CD...I was all ready to sell my ""RCA 100 Years of Music - Best of Neil Sedaka""...I pop the CD in my car in front of the store, and what do I find? RE-RECORDINGS! I HATE RE-RECORDINGS! Especially when the package does not indicate this fact. Come on Razor and Tie; couldn't you work out a deal with RCA to get access to the original masters? I really get disgusted with this type of ""bait and switch"" sales strategy. I only wish that I had waited to read the reviews here at Amazon; I would never have bought this sham..."
3,Not all songs are originals,"What the hell, no where on the case states that these songs are not all originals, almost all his 60s hits on this are rerecordings of him covering his older material in recent recordings. How could they do this to Sedaka fans, we want all originals, they are much better. At least his 70s stuff on this are the original recordings, but that doesn't make up for the other half that consists of purely rerecordings. Good thing I only checked this out from the library, avoid this and get very best of Neil Sedaka for his original 60s hits."
5,Outstanding,An extremely talented man and a timeless singer. We are fortunate to be able to get these CD's. Thank you.
2,Just Okay,"Neil Sedaka is one of my all time favorites, and this was my very first music download. I was slightly disappointed, though, as I only liked about half of the numbers. It was as if they would alternate one good number with a so-so number after it. I guess what I'd really like is a download of just his best classics. I'll probably search for that next time I download."
1,"BREAKING UP, NEXT DOOR, HAPPY BIRTHDAY SWEET 16--NOT ORIGINALS",These listed songs contained in the CD are NOT the original RCA recordingS nor are they the original arrangements created by Alan Lorber. They are poor re-arranged copies without the original rhythm section intricacies.He did this once before a number of years ago in an earlier album of so-called reissues. Shame again!
4,Acceptable,"We expected more from this album. Not that it isn't good. It is a good compilation of Neil's work. I guess we expected some new music and for that reason only is why the ""acceptable"" title and a 4 star rating.He is a great entertainer. The limited amount of new music on this CD is disappointing. None the less you can enjoy the old favorites all on one CD.It is enjoyable."
2,Through the years originals?,"Just my two cents on this. I grew up listening to Neil Sedaka and his other contemporaries. I have to clarify that I'm writing this mostly cause I hate re-recordings. They tend to hi-jack the true spirit of the music as we knew it.Whenever any performer have endurance throughout the decades, you can't expect a definitive compilation may include all the original recordings, mostly due to label changes. Rhino are the only guys (and I don't own any financial association with them) that have been offering this, as they pay royalties for gathering original takes from different record labels. That makes it clear: you got to pay a little more for ""real definitive compilations""."
5,The best!!,"This is the best beginning ""How To"" on genealogy I have ever come across in 20 years. I checked out a copy from my local library, and after just a few pages had to stop reading, because I was wanting to make notes in the margins! I had to run to the bookstore for one! I sincerely hope and highly recommend the publishers print another edition. I am looking for several copies for friends and to donate to my Family History Center."
4,Perfect,"These headset ear pads fit our Plantronics device perfectly. No doubt, we will order these again the next time these wear out."
1,"Cranberries very tough, like rocks","Ordered from Amazon and the item received was already expired. Complained to Amazon customer service but received no response so far. Very disappointing shopping experience. Would recommend buying from local grocery market, i.e. Whole Foods."
1,Don't break you teeth on cranberrys,"I loved the Hawiaan mix, and when it was no longer available, I decided to go for this one. I am so disappointed, and spend my mornings picking out the cranberry rocks. Ussually all Udi products for the gluten free are superior, but this cranberry granola should never leave the factory,"
3,Looking for KMFDM?..,"If you are looking at this cd for KMFDM's work...dont go out of your way to purchase it..take a look at their new tribute album or even RETRO which contains all their best. The remixes on this album are alright so if you have a lot of money to spend, go for it!"
2,So-so,"Bought this remote about a year and a half ago, and threw it away last night.The ""touch-screen"" is very gimmicky and is much more of an annoyance than a feature. The inset panel makes the buttons difficult to hit with one hand, and you can't locate a button by touch, so you have to look at the remote everytime you want to press a button on it. That cost it two stars.Last night, the remote finally died. It went haywire, acting completely dead at times, and randomly pressing its own buttons and activating its backlight at others. This cost it another star.I wish I could give more than 2 stars after a year and a half, but now that I have reverted to the old set of remotes that this one replaced, I realize how much I missed them."
2,Not Totally Universal,I bought the URC6690 as a Christmas gift. I was unable to control the DirectTV DVR Model HR40. The manufacture never replied to my email asking for help upgrading the device. The controller may not work with any DirectTV DVR's so beware. The remote seems to be well built but only a few buttons are programmable so it cannot learn an entire remote control.
5,Fabulous Movie for Toddlers,My 4 1/2 and 2 year old absolutely loved this movie. We originally rented this Mickey from the library and can no longer renew it. The characters look and sound acurate. Highly recommended.
1,2 yr old girl scared of it,"My 2-year-old daughter LOVES Minnie Mouse and LOVES princesses so when she saw the song from this movie on her Disney Princess Sing Along DVD she would always say ""Princess Minnie"" (even though its really Queen Minnie). So I got this movie anticipating that she'd love it but she was afraid of the bad guys. So she never watches it at all. Oh well, at least I bought a used copy so I didn't blow a lot of money on it. Maybe she'll like it later at a different age."
4,Great Disney film,"My son saw this on Disney Junior and loved it. He already loved Mickey Mouse Playhouse, so he loved the basic characters (Donald, Goofy, Pete, Minnie and Daisy) in this movie. And he loves the music from the movie, so we purchased the music CD from the movie to listen to in the car. The music is based on classics like Bizet's Carmen, The Pirates of Penzance and Strauss's Blue Danube. Great fun for my 5 yr old and 3 yr old twins."
3,Disappointed,"For some reason, I thought this was a film that I saw as a kid, so I was expecting older character voices. My 7 year old son loved it, but I am disappointed that it's a recent film with modern ""cool"" voices and characters, which I am not a fan of. Given that it's not a classic, I think it's not worth the almost $15 price on Amazon."
5,the three musketeers,i think this movie will be the best of mickey's 75th birthday i hope i will buy this movie. all for one and one for all. from the three musketeers.
2,Nice but...,"There was so much potential for this. What could have been a much funny movie was toned down quite a bit. And for Mickey and company's first feature film in many years, wouldn't it have made more sense to release it into the theaters first? With the classic look of Disney animated films from the past, it might have been a winner ."
1,Awful. Awful. Awful.,"I was shocked to read the many wonderful reviews here. Being a fan of most things Disney, I picked this one up locally a few months ago. Me and my preteen daughter sat down to watch it, and gave up before ever finishing viewing it. The script is dull. The songs, while based on 'classic' melodies, are amateurish. (What happened to all the wonderful songs that graced the 1990's Disney films?) Even the characters voices bear no resemblence to the ones we are familiar with. (Yes, I'm aware that the actors doing the voices during the 30's through 50's have long since died. But surely a company with the funds Disney has could find voice talent that could do at least a passable facsimile.Disney should be ashamed of putting their name on this yawner."
3,scratch easily,gave away. only able to watch it about 5 times. dvd scratch and stop playing. need to be careful with this product.
2,"Arrived quickly, but skips a lot while playing and now won't play at all","I was so very excited to see that there was this DVD for sale, as it was a used item, I was so delighted how reasonably priced it was. I have been renting it via Amazon and that was getting expensive. The DVD arrived quickly and was very well packaged...unfortunately, it doesn't play well. There are no obvious scratches on the DVD but it was constantly skipping and now I cannot even get it to play....I'm going to try it on my portable DVD player but it looks like I may have to purchase another one...oh well, at least it wasn't a significant amount of money...."
2,Disney's Musketeers,"Growing up with Disney, my husband and I were dissapointed in this video. Instead of taking the classic humor of things like falling, tripping, being knocked on the head with an anvel, this video uses degrading language as it's humor. By this I mean the character's would call each other names like ""stupid"" and cut down on one another.We bought this for our 3 year old and didn't think we'd have to review it before he watched it because it's Disney! We ended up having to skip through sections we didn't think age appropriate. We didn't even finish watching the video. I would say the minimum age for this video is 5-6yo.We will be reviewing all Disney videos before we let our children watch them from now on."
2,don't like it,"I purchased this dvd for my 3 yr old. He didn't particularly like this movie when i first put it in, so it took me a while to convince him to watch it. Once he decided to give it a chance, he watched it the whole way through, but it's not a movie he asks to watch. This may be due to the fact that it's a classic mickey mouse movie rather than the modern mickey mouse clubhouse that he's used to watching."
5,Classics!,"Must have for any generation, Mickey Mouse is still awesome! Much better than these new generation boring cartoons! Highly recommended."
5,Kids love it,Kids love it and watch it all the time. Streaming video is a plus. I wish all videos where avaliable via streaming video
3,They are terribly cute but...,"My wife fell in love with these the minute we hit the door of the Le Creuset outlet store. I have to admit that they do look good on the kitchen table (we have the yellow ones). There's not much to a set of salt and pepper shakers, but here are my observations:The plastic plug in the base (which you remove to fill the shakers) is extremely hard to get out. I had to go to the garage and get a pair of pliers, which worked but I am sure after a few years this will cause these plastic plugs to wear out...The design of the shakers is top heavy. This means that every time I go to grab one, or bump one, etc... they seem to be falling over.These are just minor points. For the price I would probably buy them again because they do look good and of course they do provide salt and pepper as well as one would expect."
2,Not in good condition as stated.,"I ordered this book because I used to have a copy and wanted to get it again.The book I ordered was listed as being in good condition, but the book I received as not at all in good condition. The cover is very worn at the edges, frayed actually, so that it is beginning to tear off. THere are multiple notes and markings throughout the book, and the paper is worn and in bad condition.It's as if it was left out on the back porch for about a year and then brought inside and mailed to me.Not good. Usable, but just barely due to the condition of the cover - It's just about falling apart."
4,a change of venue for Baldacci,I'm a big fan of his political thrillers. This book delivered a welcome change of venue and much better than his True Blue attempt to shift gears.
3,The Winner - different,"David Baldacci has always been one of my favorite authors, but this book was very different from any I have ever read before. The beginning 1/4 of the book was almost enough to make me put it down and not finish the book. I could not figure out where it was going and I found it boring. Finally the book skipped 10 years and it became a little more interesting. I did finish it, but found it to be a little unbelievable."
2,A great idea,"poorly executed. With so many ways to go with this, Baldacci takes the road to tedium. 100 pages too long into the bargain.EKW"
3,thoroughly enjoyable,"The book was quite weird at first. It was kind of hard to understand. Although there were a lot of exciting times in it, there were also a lot of inconsistensies. Nevertheless, the writing style is very smooth. The book overall is enjoyable. It is not at all disappointing, although it could have been made better."
4,Easy read!!! You want to finish it in one sitting,"Very easy readable book...If you like Grishom, you will love Baldacci.....A masterful story for everyone, if you havent read it yet, what are you waiting for"
5,Entertaining tale,"I enjoyed The Winner so much that I purchased the audiotapes after reading the book because I wanted it in both formats. There are noticeable gaps in the plot, which weakens it, but that could be expected with the passage of over 10 years of time. The most believable characters are LuAnne and Jackson and the least believable would be Charlie. Nevertheless, I found the The Winner to be great fun and I would recommend the book or the tapes to any reader who wants to have a good time with a tall story. I think we can count on the fact that this story will become a movie in the near future."
3,"Buy The Premise, Buy The Bit","Buy the premise, buy the bit. Moderately-paced thriller about a man of many disguises who has developed a way to rig the National Lottery. He has picked a dozen impoverished people to be winners. One of them is our intrepid heroine who unites with another far-fetched character, an ex-FBI agent on the witness protection program, to bring the bad guy to his knees.This is the weakest of Baldacci's four novels but adequate to entertain although very implausible if you really stop to think about it."
3,my review,This plot is about a woman who receives an incredible offer: to become a millionaire. She accepts but in the end she becomes a very unhappy woman.The author has a very unusual story: about lotteries and how you can beat them.I thought this book to be very enjoyable. The story is well thought-out and the characters blend well with the story. There is never a dull moment in the book and it all seems to flow easily and to keep the reader glued to the book.Good read.
2,"Good Start, but poor finish","Baldacci ""grabs"" you at the beginning, but I believe he ""tires"" toward the the story's end, and it drifts to a much-too-predictable conclusion. Maybe six hundred plus pages is just too much to fill...."
4,great book!!,"I really enjoyed this book! The middle dragged a little for awhile, but the pace is quickly picked up again a short time later. Great characters, great plot. I highly recommend this one!!"
3,"Implausible, but fun.","This book moves fast. If you stop to think about it too much, it won't work for you. Definitely unrealistic. The Lu Ann character is too unbelievably good to be true. ""Stronger than any man, totally broke, but won't cash in on a chance of a lifetime, completely ethical, great mother and on and on and on."" If you can get through her perfection, it's a fun story."
3,"GOOD, BUT NOT GREAT....","THE WINNER started off slowly, but developed into a decent book, although, not on par with his first two novels. Great reading for the train, fast moving and easy to follow. A little too predictable at the end."
3,"Certainly fast-moving, but plausible? Well....","The Winner, by David Baldacci definitely moves right along, and is undeniably original. But originality like this sometimes brings a plot that is contorted beyond description. Mr. Baldacci has something in his book for just about everyone, including gamblers and romance-novel purists. He spins quite a yarn, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a fast, riveting read even if it is a bit implausible. In some ways it may not quite stand up to comparison with his previous works (it is difficult for me to visualize this as a successful screenplay), but it's a pretty exciting read nonetheless, and that's worth a lot."
2,Stretches credibility beyond breaking point,"I appreciate that fiction has evolved to a point where credibility is not an essential requirement, but please, how hokey can it get.... This story disappointed me by its tacky method for fixing the lottery. It just sort of cast a dreary pall over the story, which was not unlike the '50's (?) TV show The Millionaire...poor girl gets money and runs...Not a good read."
2,STARS FOR FIRST HALF,A DIFFICULT BOOK TO FINISH. I FOUND MYSELF FLIPPING THRU PREDICTABLE PAGES. THESE WERE AFTER SHE RETURNED TO THE US. UP UNTIL THEN GREAT READING. STILL HAVE TO FINISH. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!
1,There is no way Baldacci could have written this book...,"What a clunker. The prose and grammar are so bad in this book it could not have been written by the same man who wrote Total Control, etc.Also, take the safety off of a revolver? Where might one find a manual safety on a revolver? How about some research?What a rip."
2,Eh....,"This book was just so-so. It had an interesting premise but the bad, lowest-common denominator writing and shallow, one-dimentional characters sqandered a potentially decent story. The female lead could've been a real heroine if she wasn't such a figment of her male writer's fantasies. If you want to read a silly book and forget about it as soon as you put it down, this one's for you. Or, you could be a real-life winner and just skip this one altogether."
1,Used book,"Description said book was in ""Good"" condition. When it arrived it had several loose pages and a broken spine that would allow additional pages to be loose shortly."
3,classic Baldacci,"Very interesting book..as i have found all of Baldaccis books..Good characters with LuAnn, Charlie, Riggs and the villan, Jackson..well thought out schemes by both the good and bad..i did however feel it was kind of hard to believe that the villan was able to actually fool people with his array of disguises..was everybody 5 foot 10 in the book or what..sometimes the least obvious can be the dead give-away to the trained eye..and there were alot of trained eyes involved in this novel..i recommend it to anyone who likes a good murder mystery.."
3,Not as good as his others!,"I enjoyed this book but did not feel that it lived up to the first two Baldacci books. It was almost totally unbelievable! The character of Jackson got by with too much, too easily -- for years! Why didn't someone catch on to him before all that! It was an easy and at some times an enjoyable read, but too far fetched!"
4,This book needs to be told on the Big Screen.,"I picked up the book and by the days end I had the first half read. It was over 4 months before I picked it back up.(I thought I'd loss the book!) I found it under my car seat and took it into work with me. I was almost fired, because I spent the entire day reading the second half. Couldn't put it down. If my boss did give me a choice to leave or stop reading. Well, I'd be reading another David Baldacci novel in the unemployement line. LuAnn Tyler sould be brought to life on the big screen. I pictured Nave Campbell as LuAnn. A friend of mine said a Baldwin could easily be Riggs. To be honest I don't have a clue who would be great enough to tackle the creepy role of Jackson. Keep up the good work."
3,Entertaining and amusing,"After reading the review at the top of the page from Kirkus Reviews, I just had to write. Whomever wrote that review really needs to reread the book (and carefully!) because he or she got the plot all wrong. Charlie is NOT the executioner, doesn't see wedding bells, nor does he follow LuAnn to Sweden. He accompanies her, at her request! I cannot believe Amazon.com would post such an inaccurate, poorly-researched review. I'm disappointed."
4,A very good book!,"I enjoyed this book a great deal. After reading Baldacci's previous 2 books I couldn't help but pick this one up too. LuAnn, the main character, is a remarkable person. Not only is she strong in her morals, but she can kick *** when it comes right down to it. I've read a few reviews complaining that she is too good to be true. Um, isn't this supposed to be fiction? I personally like a little drama. The way she takes care of herself and the people around her is fantastic. Overall, a very good book. I would recommend it to anyone."
2,Started great and kept going downhill,I thought the first half of the book was excellent - kept me interested and the characters were intriguing. Then...it just became predictable and I knew basically how it would end up. Second half of book very disappointing
2,Not David Baldacci's Best. At All.,"In D.Baldacci's Camel Club books, he creates believable characters. He also creates believable scenes. In The Winner, neither is true. First, it seems that Part One was written as a short story or novelette. He could have ended there nicely. Unfortunately, he didn't, and the beginning of Part Two has the main character, LuAnn, making a decision that--given her independent spirit, not having a good childhood, and love of her little girl--never would have done. All of the characters are cardboard and unbelievable. The story line is contrived. Then there is the constant use of the words, ""...eyes bored into..."" And the worst phase--""...her breasts quivered."" Breasts quivering?! Come on, David, that's for the newbie writers!Yes, it's a page turner, and that's why I give it two stars. Something is always going on, and you'll read it to see if your guesses are right."
5,Quite good,"This is my second novel by Baldacci, having read his ""Christmas Train"" first. I wasn't disappointed in this effort in the least! It seems Baldacci has a knack for strong character development. Some authors go on too long, trying to describe their characters, while others don't divulge nearly enough. Baldacci gets it right!LuAnn Tyler is a strong female character, and Charlie is a wonderful ""oversized teddy-bear"" like man. The ambition and charisma of these two have you hoping for their success. The plot is great, and the setting is described wonderfully. Some things about the antagonist irked me a bit, but not enough to take away from the story.This certainly will not be my last novel by Baldacci!"
2,Too Predictable,"Most of the David Baldacci books that I have read have kept me very interested all the way too the end. This book started out fairly strong but then I began to feel I knew what was going to happen. It does have a great villian but the other characters relationships were very perdictable. I kept reading the book, hoping I was wrong. The book ended up as I expected and I find that disappointing."
4,slow start big finish!!,It did not reach out and grab me in the beginning but with each page it pulled me in. Great read
2,Very Disappointing Narration,"Mr. Baldacci's story, as usual, had me hooked from page one. However, the reader of the audio version not only almost put me to sleep, she almost put herself to sleep! And it seemed to get worse as the reading went along. I respectfully hope Mr. Baldacci doesn't use this person again."
4,"Amazing! Kinda complex and branchy, but amazing.","Jackson has got to be one clever deciever! Fortunately, LuAnn is smarter! It's amazing seeing how she has to undergo all this torture just to get her name cleared and that rat Jackson off her back! I'll probably never look at any lottery the same way again! Even though it was a significantly long novel, I was able to finish it in about a week. I hope I will win at least $100 someday, and I'll think about this book."
1,Too unrealistic,"The villian was way to unrealistic and the plot didn't have very much depth. I was very disappointed. Too sum up my feelings, ""Don't waste your time!"""
1,THE LOSER!!!,"I just scrolled through 60 reviews and it surprises me that no one came up with the obvious--- The Winner is the Loser! Sorry DB, but you have done much better in the past. I loved Absolute Power and believe the movie was a gross injustice to the book. Total Control had me happily reading along. But The Winner? Argh!!! What agony! Please, if you must, dear determined readers of The Winner, borrow it from your local library and save your hard-earned dollars for a future and, hopefully, considerably improved, title worthy of the name Baldacci. Can't WIN 'em all, folks."
1,The Winner...NOT,"The first 2 books were the the winners, not this un-edited, overly long manuscript. Please Mr. Baldacci, don't catch Stephen Kingitis. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME."
3,Show me the Money,I found this book to be quite interesting. It started off pretty fast and the author really didnt have anywhere to go with the characters. I found it very easy to root for Lou Ann. Jackson made her an offer in which she really could not refuse. She really did not have anything to lose. I thought some of plot was pretty predictable but it still kept my attention. There was alway's a just in case factor in this book. I did find the storyline with Uncle Charlie kinda of okey dokey.I mean really a hit man turns uncle. If you can get to the last part of the book you wont be disappointed. It was a real page turner at the end. I realy felt like I was in the scenes with Lou Ann Matt Riggs and Uncle Charlie. I would buy another Baldacci book in a heartbeat!!!
1,"Baldacci is a great author, but this one didnt sum up","LuAnne Tyler is a trailor trash woman, who wins, wouldnt you guess it, 100 million dollars. Amazing isnt it? Not really. Total Control was an excellent book, so i decided to read The Winner, even though the intelect level was fairly high, it was one of the few books that i chose to not finish, even though i was very near the end, and i am not normally one to put a book down.If you are wanting to read a David Baldacci, read ""Total Control"", if you want a cliche story of a lottery winner, that won't make you want to continue reading, read this book. I've read much better, nice try David, but try again."
1,A by-the-numbers thriller that didn't thrill.,"I read Baldacci's ""Absolute Power"" and I enjoyed it a lot more than this trite, boring book. I found the story and the characters too implausible. I had no trouble putting the book down at night."
1,A ridiculous collection of cliches.,"I read and enjoyed Absolute Power and Total Control and can't believe that this novel was by the same author. The premise was good and the character of Jackson was fascinating (though absurd), but the storyline became so hackneyed and cliched that I almost quit reading the book. The numerous ""fight scenes"" were so contrived as to be laughable. A high school English student could write a more believable and entertaining novel. What a joke!"
1,One dimensional comic book characters,"""The Winner"" was a Christmas present to me this year and I was glad I did not pay for the book. All the characters are painted in flat, superhero (or villain) primary colors. The protagonist, LuAnn Tyler is a drop dead gorgeous woman who is physically stronger than any of the men in the novel, tougher than any of the men, and is as smart as any of the good guys there. The villain, Jackson is brilliant, immensely rich, all-powerful, all knowing, and is skilled in all the ways on how to kill a person. The other characters go down from there. The novel's plot line and the dilemma created from the plot are simplistic. Needless to say, I do not recommend buying/reading this book. The reading experience is akin to watching TV."
1,This is on the Bestseller list?????,"I would have given this book great reviews if someone had told me it was written by an eighth-grade adolescent. I purchased this book before getting on an airplane and found myself so bored, I began reading the emergency card in the back of the seat to stay awake! The plot had more holes in it than swiss cheese. One man controlling billions of dollars, yet has enough time to work a job at the company that cleans the balls for the lottery machine, appear at different locations throughout the world on a moment's notice, and is able to control covert political operations in third world countries. I'm writing to the publisher to get my money back."
2,"good start, weak middle and ending",i gave it 2 stars as i felt that overall i would not recommend this book.
2,bubble gum for the brain,"Starts great, rapidly goes downhill, predictable, boring, no depth to the characters. Very disappointing, so glad I didn't buy it, don't waste your time!!"
5,Best thriller novel since Craig Furnas's THE SHAPE,This is one of the best thriller novels I've read since Craig Furnas's THE SHAPE. (THE SHAPE is also available on Amazon.com)
3,A let down from his first two novels.,"I would rate his first two novels ""Absolute Power"" and ""Total Control"" as solid 9's. Good entertainment, with well drafted plots, consistent writing and good solid endings. ""The Winner"" is entertaining much of the time, but there are too many gaps where the writing and the plot are like a B movie - there is no mystery after the half way point. It is too bad as the book starts well and the first section is entertaining, starts with the beginings of a good plot with a lot of directions to take it before finishing. Unfortunately the story becomes bland after LuAnn wins the Lottery, and losses the pace and any sense of mystery. The story becomes too predictable and the characters appear like Barby and Ken - plastic.Unfortunately I think I have lost one of my new favorite writers. I will be more critical before I buy one of his books again."
4,"If you read for entertainment, don't miss this one","Although a cut below Absolute Power and Total Control from a technical standpoint, The Winner provides a very entertaining read. Those looking for great literature should look elsewhere with the other snobs, but those looking for a well paced novel with a heroine instead of a hero for a change, this is a rewarding book. With so many poorly written books being passed off as bestsellers, it's nice to have confidence in a writer like Mr. Baldacci."
2,Getting worse not better,"This is Baldacci's third book, and I've read the first two so far, which started off good with Absolute Power and deteriorated a bit with Total Control, but The Winner just doesn't cut it for me. I'm not giving it 1 star because I think the story is good it's just that the writing is a little too cliché, the metaphors too corny, and it's sort of juvenile overall for my taste."
3,"Good idea, poor execution of plot","I was very intriguied by this book and drawn in...but as it went on, it became predictable and even a bit unbelievable. Not one of his best."
5,"Another Baldacci ""Winner""",I enjoy Baldacci as a writer and this book was very hard to put down. Good twists and turns. This would make a good book to do a book report on if they still do those sort of things in school. Good characters and good pace.
2,THE WINNER,THE BOOK DID DRAG IN SEVERAL PLACES AND THE PLOT BECAME REPETISIOUS. THE SEVERAL COSTUMES OF THE VILLIAN BECAME A LITTLE FAR OUT AND HARD TO IMAGINE
4,"An Improbable,entertaining journey","I am a huge David Baldacci fan, and while this book was not his best, it was extremely entertaining. His character development was wonderful and the plot, though highly implausible, drew you in and took you on an action filled ride. There were some nice twist and turns but the ending was a little too pat for me."
3,Good Premise - but lacks sufficient surprises,"A bit of a disappointment. I had read Baldacci's Stone Cold and really enjoyed it. This one has a nice premise but fails to deliver. Poor woman is offered chance to get out of her miserable life by participating in a fixed lottery. It is clear that the man offering the deal is both brilliant and extremely dangerous. The plot is reasonable, and the characters have some depth. The problem is that there was nothing really surprising. Anyone who has read these types of thriller has a pretty good idea about what is going to happen. If I read Baldacci again, I'll stick to his spy novels."
3,Mediocre novel that was a little unbelievable,"I have enjoyed Baldacci books in the past but must say I was a little bit disappointed in this one. It dragged on longer than I thought was necessary and in doing so it took me much longer to read this than most novels. I thought the plot was a little overdone,,,the over evil villian who is evil for the sake of evil,,,the stereotypical helpless bumbling Georgia trailer park girl who against all odds outsmarts the professionals at the FBI, and some unrealistic connections amongst characters that make the whole thing so far from realistic it turns you off to the whole novel. Its so predictable that I really wanted to put the book down but had invested too much time in it not to finish."
3,Not my favorite,I love when David Baldacci writes about Washington DC. This was not about DC - what a disappointment. A Lottery winner - I wasn't much interested.
5,Slow Start---- Great Ending,Good Read - More words are required to get this published... So here are some words and more and more
4,A good read,"Not a classic, but hard to put down, none the less! Baldacchino is a great story teller. I enjoyed it!"
3,The Winner,"I don't think this was up to the usual Baldacci novel. It was weak in places and rather far fetched and not very believable in that the plot for the lead character, staggered at the end."
4,Easy too read excitement,I enjoyed this book tremendously although Baldacci did overdo the relationship between mother and daughter in the first third of the book. That said I couldnt put it down and will eargerly await his next book. (In the meantime read Alan Folsom 'Day after Tommorrow' and await his second book 'Day of Confession')
5,A real Page Turner,"David Baldacci's ""The Winner"" was a real page turner. The characters were true to life and the ""bad guy"" Jackson was great! This was an excellent story and can't wait to read more of Baldacci."
3,Fun read! Not as good as Absolute Power and Total Control.,"As assistant to the Director of the Trauma Center at the University of Virginia Health System I would like to say ""thank you"" to Mr. Baldacci, on behalf of the Trauma Center, for the reference to, and his comments in the book regarding the quality of our Center."
4,Enjoyed this book...,This is the first book I've read of Baldacci. Enjoyed this book very much and I will read his other works now. A good and fast read.
3,Entertaining,"This book is not great but it is sure entertaining! If you just want an easy satisfiying lounge on your chair at the beach book, then this is definitely the one for you!"
4,My 4th Baldacci book - another Winner,"I liked th fast-paced storyline, most of the characters, and the plot. I thought Matt was a little boring and I thought LuAnn was just too perfect. But, otherwise, a great book."
5,The Winner is a winner.,The winner is a supurb read. Great fun. Hat's off to David Baldacci for another great book.
3,Good but not great,It kept me entertained but it wasn't a page turner. I easily put this book down plenty of times.
1,A big disappontment,"Disappointing hardly begins to describe this book. After enjoying two other books by David Baldacci, I have to wonder if he employed a hack to ghost write this one. The miserable dialogue, lack of real research, stock characters, and oh yes, forseeable plot development rate a big zero for effort."
3,"Pretty Good, but not Stellar","Baldacci never totally disappoints, but he frequently doesn't totally satisfy. That's my take on this one, along with about half of his I've read. A woman lured into a rigged lottery scheme because she's so beautiful and her daughter's so cute that the fiendish lotterymeister can't resist making her into the multimillion dollar lottery poster girl. Then she's chased by the meister's assassin, who falls in love with her, and . . . . aw, come on, David. A lot more action ensues. People get chased, shot at and in the end I didn't care that much. It's entertainment, and the best thing I can say about this one is that it's at least as good as half the crap you can read out there. So if you love Baldacci, enjoy. But if you're seeking him at his best, which is very good, pass and look for his next one. Or the next after that."
1,too much stupidity,"First, the idea of a ""fixed result"". It's just an impossible thing to happen.Second, the trilling effects were mainly caused by stupidities of LuAnn Tyler herself. This makes reader feels to be fooled by the author..."
3,Pretty Formula but Fast paced,"This book does have quite a few structure problems that I am not going to get into. That said, not really dull. Not great but not dull."
5,Winner,No longer have a casset player gave the book away and that person said it was five star bookI need on CD or MP3
1,Baldacci's worst - Spoiler,"This is Baldacci's worst. I could never get over the fact that this woman got tired of living in Europe and New Zealand. And why did she think she had to keep on the run in Europe, but could come home to the US where she was wanted for murder and settle down. The premise was just plain stupid (please keep in mind that I love Baldacci's other books). If this woman had stayed away, many innocent people would not have died. Yeah, because of her they caught the bad guy, but he had stopped rigging the lottery and killing people long ago. Was catching him really worth more people getting killed? How ironic that after getting these people killed she still got to keep $100 million tax-free."
3,"Well written, but this yarn's a little hard to swallow...","This book is well-written and very suspenseful, but the plot is a bit convoluted and hard to believe at times. Still, it's an entertaining read but not nearly as compelling as Baldacci's other works, especially ""Absolute Power."""
4,"Believable characters, well-paced, fascinating premise","""The Winner,"" was a well-paced and intricately developed book with sympathetic protagonists and credible antagonists. It compares favorably to some of the better fiction of J. Kellerman, and does not quite hit the pinnacle of Baldacci's earlier novel, Absolute Power, but far exceeds his last novel, Total Control. Some books take two weeks to read - The Winner is of the two-day variety; a page-turner. Personally, I enjoy plot twists late in the story, and Baldacci does not disappoint."
2,The Loser!!,"I cannot believe this is the same person who wrote that fantastic book, Absolute Power. David, what happened???? The story is very fascinating but the characters were not. I found myself rooting for the villian who is definitely a very bad person. But our herione, LuAnn, is not believable. He has her as a backward hick who does not have a social security number on one hand and then he has her acting like a genius on the other hand. There were just too many up and downs for me. I am sure the next book will be back on track."
4,The Winner,This novel held my interest from start to finish and was a very imaginative plot with unexpected twists. Found it hard to put down. Can recommend to anyone who likes a different take on a thriller/mystery novel.
3,Winner/Loser,"This book starts a little slowly, but soon it develops into a spellbinder. Baldachi again does very well with detail. Unfortunately, the book arrived in poor condition, and it was not a good value. Even so, Baldachi remains my favorite author for pleasure reading."
4,What a storyteller ...,"and what a creative mind! David Baldacci hits another home run with THE WINNER. When you get a minute to stop and think about it, you say, ""Where does one person comes up with this stuff?"" The few small moments of incredulity in the book are easily overlooked by the clever and fast-paced scope of the story.It is a great read."
3,bad dialogue voice,"Not a bod book, but the voice the speaker chose for the main character is very poor. She sounds week, vulnerable and incompetent- which is NOT who the character is."
4,It Could Happen,"I enjoyed this book and the characters. The idea of fooling the Lottery is a very real thing. I liked how the main character matured from a dirt poor girl to a rich, put together woman. Naturally, having huge amounts of money helps."
1,Predictable and tedious but I read it anyway,"This was my first Balducci book. Had to read it so as not to disappoint my daughter who gave it to me for Christmas. As compared to Clancy, Forsyth, Follett, Grisham, Ludlum and others, well what can I say? If the ""The Winner"" is typical work from this author, then perhaps he should take more lessons from the established mystery writers. There was not one 'Jackson' character that I didn't pick up on immediately. Didn't anybody tell this guy that revolvers don't have safeties on them or that shotguns don't shoot bullets or that hiding a .44 magnum in a jacket pocket is about as realistic as hiding a gallon of milk in one? Predictable and tedious, but I read it."
2,Does anyone actually ENJOY the voice of Frances Cassidy?,"This book (Baldacci's part) is fine - but OMG I cannot stand Frances Cassidy's narration style!!! She CAN vary her tonal quality, I've heard her do it. But for the most part she uses a PAINFULLY monotone voice. Arrrgh! It is SO hard to listen to - and for 14 cd's! I wish someone at Books On Tape would direct her differently. I really want to hear this book, but I feel like I outta be paid to put up with Cassidy.Recently I heard a story about audiobooks on NPR. They gave an example of a book you should not listen to while driving because the voice would lull you to sleep. I'm pretty sure the reader was Frances Cassidy.I'm sure she is a fine human being...yadda yadda. I just wish she would do her job differently."
3,Entertaining,"Baldacci is very good at spinning an entertaining yarn with sympathetic characters and very canny villains. Lots of action here in a story that almost anyone can relate to in regard to imagining how we might deal with winning a huge lottery. The story remained tight and well paced for better than two thirds of the book, but got a little bogged down in technicalities toward the end, and the plot was wrapped up just a little bit too neatly IMHO. I got this book on my Kindle and intend to keep my favs as long as I can. When I need to clean house to make room for more books, The Winner may be the first to go. It was fun while it lasted, but certainly not something I'd plan to revisit."
5,The Winner,"Jackie Tortorella expressed my thoughts accurately. However, I would add this: Although this book could be termed a ""page turner"", I recommend that the reader take his/her time and savor this author's writing like one savors a fine wine or elegant cuisine."
5,Excellent First Baldacci Experience,"This is the first Baldacci book I have read and found it to be quality reading that stimulated my mind. Some thrillers move very quickly and mindlessly fly by, but this book was a page turner that required you to emerse yourself into the nove. I will read more Baldacci."
4,White Trash Meets Millions,"David Baldacci is a truly gifted writer. He has that unique ability to paint a picture such that one can actually picture themselves in the trailer with LuAnn, holding our breaths as we wish her the best in making her escape.I had a hard time putting this book down. In fact, I finished it in two days.After winning her millions and making a successful break, we are re-introduced to LuAnn a decade later. The two LuAnn's are not even comprable--a testimony to what millions and proper tutoring can do!For anyone who enjoys suspensful fiction, this is a great read."
3,Kind of a Grisham book ripoff,"This book was pretty good in the beginning, but I thought the villian was a little over the top. I once was a scientist and thought the portrayal was pretty streotypical, to say the least. I must not have taken the Chem class on how to poison and kill people! The heroine character was fleshed out pretty well too, although I found her perfection kind of annoying. This is the first Baldacci book I have read - I suppose the others must be variations on this theme. This book could make a good cheesy movie, along the lines of ""The Hand that Rocks the Cradle."""
2,"Great concept, Terrrible execution","I thought that this was a good concept, but the writing was sub-par, at best. The characters were one-dimensional and the dialogue was stilted. I wish this concept had been handled by a better writer."
2,No Winner Here,"I just finished reading my first David Baldacci novel, and I wasn't very impressed. The plot was very contrived, and the whole time I was reading the book I felt like I was two steps ahead of what was going on. Although Baldacci set up the story pretty well,after page 50 I felt like he lost his inspiration and mailed in the rest of the novel. I hope that his reputation as an excellent writer of thrillers wasn't based on the garbage I just finished reading."
2,A real let-down compared to other Baldacci books,"After reading his first two novels, I could not wait to tear into The Winner. What a disappointment. Where his others were fresh, invigorating, and intricately plotted, this one was trite, predictable and utterly absurd. The characters were so one-dimensional it was embarrassing, and the scenarios he had them in were typical cookie-cutter thriller plots. I have a hard time believing the same author wrote Absolute Power and Total Control, two books which I thought were brilliant."
4,Another fine work by Baldacci,An imaginative plot buoyed by great character development. Baldacci adds ironic twists resulting in suspenseful story.The book is difficult to put down.
2,Not a winner,"David Baldacci's ""The Winner"" is the first book by this author I've read with an unrealistic plot and characters that are not believable. It's only Baldacci's racy style that rescues this book from being a dud."
5,Baldacci's best yet!,"I've read Baldacci's Total Control and The Simple Truth. They both were entertaining, but I find The Winner to be the best of the bunch. Although predictable at times, the book still was a page-turner, especially the last 100 pages or so. Seems like another Baldacci book destined for the silver screen, following the route of Absolute Power."
4,Exciting way to spend and evening!,"Very exciting good entertainment. Intersting characters if not always believable. A little predictable in places, but kept you thinking for the most part."
5,"Fast Paced, Great read!",A fun read in the usual Baldacci tradition.Great pace and colorful characters. The ending was satisfying. This would make a fine movie.
5,A real page turner from the start.,"I have read about 14 Baldacci books. I enjoyed ""The Winner"" as much or more than any of the other books I read. You will not be disappointed"
5,I liked this book alot,"How can I put this without giving away the whole book? It is about a mysterious man that comes to a woman who is not having a good year, and tells her to use certain numbers on the lottery. Then the action begins."
3,Good enough to keep the pages turning,"The book felt quite disjointed. The reasons behind LuAnn Tyler's return to the US weren't clear at all. Even the key characters weren't given enough depth, even though Baldacci tried somewhat with Jackson. However, it was enough to while away the hours."
3,"Entertaining, but not classic.","I was interested & impressed as the plot progressed to endow the protagonist (who was endowed with all but $$$, it seems) with her lottery winnings, but from there the book digressed into a TV movie. I did find the idea of rigging the lottery, and the author's thematic comments concerning the ethics of a govt. that promotes it to be sound. I expected more from the characters: must all women be big chested & shapely? And saved by a former CIA agent? Was there a publisher's deadline? The only excuse to ruin an initially decent plot line.Entertaining, but by far not a literary, or celluloid, classic."
2,Adrienne's Review,"I wasn't thoroughly pleased with the audiobook, ""The Winner"". It didn't seem to grab my attention as much as David Baldacci's previous books. The main character, LuAnn Tyler, grabbed the reader's sympathy but the plot lacked suspenseful action and seemed at times, predictable. I gave it 2 stars because the story only faintly held my interest."
4,WAS DEFINITELY A WINNER!!,"The Winner started off a bit slowly, but picked up after the first couple of chapters. After chapter 2 it started to get more interesting and I couldn't put it down after that. To read this book you must have a great imagination and a good sense of humor. It made for excellent company."
3,interesting read but not his best,Apparently Baldacci has not taken care of small children much. He makes it seem effortless. The book is fun and I so enjoy his writing.
3,A little hard to believe....,"Is it just me, or is Luann Tyler a little to good to be true?? Cumon, the plot is a real page turner but you have to go away from this story saying ""Are you kidding me???"" There are to many instances where you question what is happening and how it is happening toward the end."
4,everybody has this wish,Gets one thinking..........what would I do? Very cleaver plot. One where you shout at the book....Dont be so stupid.One point. Is it an unwritten law not to have dead heroes.
4,Another good read by DBaldacci,"David Baldacci is one of my favorite writers. Although I found the premise of the book a bit far fetched. I did enjoy the main characters, their devotion to each other. The story was a bit too long."
2,Pretty Predictable,"Book was Ok, but not up to Baldacci mystery standards as far as I'm concerned. Atill feel his book about the president (can't recall the name) has been his best. This one a bit far-fetched.!"
4,Excellent,"A really creative idea. Well written, of course slightly implausible Jackson being the thorough mastermind would have cut Luann loose once he realized the potential criminal charges she could have been facing in Georgia but otherwise good plot twists."
4,Good Read.,Interesting concept! I'll never look at the lottery the same as before the book. I enjoyed reading the book very much.
4,The Winner,The winner was a very enjoyable read that kept you turning the pages . A twist at the end that you may have forgot from earlier.
2,The Winner,I have read several of his books. The Winner iis not what I consider one of his better books. I was very surprised with all the excellent reviews.
3,Not very amazing,"This wasn't a bad book at all but it wasn't amazing. I really wanted to know how the lottery was fixed, and that explanation seemed a little lame, honestly. I would have liked to see more of the story from Jackson's view- it was more interesting when I read how he was thinking instead of viewing his actions through others. Sometimes I had to suspend belief- some things I just couldn't see how it was possible- even for the super rich.The story got bogged down in the middle and then really picked up at the end. The little twist was good- I wouldn't have guessed Jackson's true identity at all.Riggs was too good to be true, I would have liked to see his motives be more than just attraction."
3,The Winner,"Let me start by saying I have always enjoyed Baldacci's writing. While I enjoyed ""The Winner"", it is not his best effort. I found it just good enough to keep reading, but certainly not something that you had trouble laying down."
3,Protagonist ruins the book,"The story is solid and interesting, but the fact that I did not like the protagonist ruins the book for me.The success on this story hinges on the likeability of the main character, because if you can't root for her, then you're not going to enjoy this book.However, I'm sure I'm in the minority here, but I got tired of hearing about how beautiful, humble, smart, intelligent, blah blah blah.....the main character was. On the surface, all she was was just your typical un-wed, white trash mother, who CHOSE to be in an abusive relationship.I had a hard time feeling sorry for this individual, because she just came across as a drain on society that seems to be averrunning this country. I just could not sympathize with her plight, and found myself rooting against her.Of course the commonality of this character is the whole appeal that Baldacci is striving for, so in that sense, he succeeds. And for that reason, this will strike a chord for most readers."
3,the winner,Give the book one hundred pages and you will enjoy it. Good suspense with good characters.
1,Junior High prose style- middle schoolers will love it.,"I wasn't expecting P. D. James, but I was hoping for a good read. I had seen the author interviewed on television and he seemed to be reasonably literate. But this thing is juvenile beyond belief. I might have ""bought"" the preposterous story line (even the part about the young mother with super-human strength and the baby which required no care) had I not been so distracted by the prose style (or lack thereof) and the poor, (abysmal describes it better) grammar. I could hardly keep my mind on the plot thread. The prose is equivalent to that one might expect of a seventh grader. I thought this man had been to college and law school. This guy makes Grisham look like potential Nobel laureate."
1,"The Winner, the Book in bad shape","the book was yellow it was so old and one of the pages torn. If I had known the shape it was in, I would not have ordered it."
2,Very disappointing,"I read a particularly bad review, ""comic book characters"", but choose not to believe it- a bad mistake! This does read like the script for a bad ""action movie"", I thought Sandra Bullock but maybe Demi Moore. My advice wait for the movie or at least paper back - compared with Mr. Baldacci's previous two books this is very disappointing."
3,Slow mover....,"Appears this book was written for the 'big screen' in mind, and not for the reader. Absolute Power was a great book plus the movie was good as well, although it was so...far from the book. Hey, David, the guys in Hollywood always change the book up so write for the reader and let the other guys do the rewrites. Also, take a look a Paul Lyndsey and you will find how to cut out alot of details, yet keep the reader on the edge. The first couple of hundred pages were slow in the development of the characters. Jackson was not as scary as you would have wanted him to appear. Expecting a Much better plot and characters in your next novel."
2,A disappointing thriller.,"It's the kind of book that makes you wonder if reading really is better than watching television. The heroine is a super hero who you know right from the beginning cant lose. All that was missing was the heading ""Soon to be a movie starring Demi Moore""."
5,Exciting and engaging!,"Baldacci definitely has a hold on the ability to keep a reader guessing! While I might take him to task about the incredible (if truly believable) powers of the main character LuAnn, his creation of Jackson, the nemesis, is simply scrumptious. Baldacci weaves a tale that is both fun to read and heart-pounding at the same time. I enjoyed this as much or more than ""Total Control"". I highly recommend it!"
3,"The book was umm, adequate.","I almost put the book down when I read that LuAnn, the heroine, bested a man splitting firewood, (who had done it all his life) and left him panting for breath. It would have been more believable, although the author makes sure you know she has incredible physical strength, if it had been a man who was in good physical shape, but hadn't done it all his life. Not to say the book is not a good one. Parts are brilliant, inventive and suspenseful, but LuAnn is just a bit too much a super-hero woman and digesting her just gives me an upset tummy."
5,The Winner is a winner,"First book I have ready by him. Will not be my last.This book so hard to put dwon. Love it all the way thru it.I have other people at work reading it now.Just wish it still didn't cost so much, since it was an older book."
4,"A real page turner, some of the action is a stretch though","The Winner is indeed a winner. It's a good book to lose yourself in for a few days. I picked this as my first Baldacci book based on some other Amazon reviews, and that was good advice. The book was a real page turner - I was looking forward to my commute on the subway every day for quality reading time. I liked the character development and the action, even though some of it was a tad far-fetched at times."
3,slow to start,My opinion was that it just took a little too long to get to the action. Once I got there I felt it was a good read.
4,The Winner.......is a Winner!!!!,"Although ""Total Control"" remains my favorite Baldacci novel, I still breezed through his latest. I found the concept of lottery tampering quite fascinating although I didn't buy Jackson's modus operandi. Luann Tyler was a believable heroine who would risk everything for her daughter. Name a parent that wouldn't? The reason I didn't give it a higher rating is because the first hundred pages were rather slow, like climbing to the top of the rollercoaster. Once on top, the ride down was fast and furious. I would like to see this turned into a movie."
4,Gets better with repeated listening,"When I first listened to this album, I liked the sound but the songs didn't take. The album seemed kind of self-indulgent and sad, sort of this artist's ""Blood on the Tracks"" but without the incredible Dylan lyrics and general songwriting. The lyrics are very simple, and repeated often. Repetition, like water drops, is kind of a theme. Maybe that's the clue to the name of the album: an apparent simplicity.The more I listen to it, the variation and complexity starts to unfold. And the songs are pretty searing, even if they don't carry Dylan's kind of poetry: Very emotionally honest stuff. At times, this isn't an easy album to listen to, in the way that Lucinda Williams' recent albums are tough. But, I now think it has some of Jesse's very best songs on it. Wolleson and Goldings sound great...the musicians are listening closely to each other. The whole album's aural quality and production are really sublime. So, recommended...don't give up on it."
2,I Cant get it yet,I have the same problem with this mag subscripcion im not sure when i can get this purshase.Please let me know and help me to know when i an get it!!!
1,Very Disappointed,"Heard so much hype about this movie and I really did not like the characters - there was nothing redeeming about their stories, lives or ANYTHING. Was hoping for something with a more meaningful story line.Sorry to say this but I thought that Jennifer Westfeldt was a better actor than she portrayed in this movie."
1,Disappointed in Friends with Kids,"The trailer was misleading and made it look like a ""funny"" movie. It was not funny at all, and was in fact, very sad and depressing. I would not recommend this movie to anyone."
4,Friends with kids is well written,"The writing is pretty smart and the tone feels natural and clever. Acting all round is very good. Overall, I enjoyed this more than I thought I would."
1,Unable to watch,I never watched it because apparently my 5meg internet connection is not powerful enough for Amazon...but Netflix plays just fine. And no refund or any way to say that I couldnt watch the video.
3,Pretty Entertaining,Starred many known actors.....but not as hilarious as I thought it would be. It's definitely a rental. Glad I didn't pay $15 to watch it in the theaters!
2,Weird movie - definitely a chick flick,"Made my poor husband watch it because I thought it was a normal, comedy type movie - and while it started as such and definitely had some funny scenes, it quickly became a major cheesy chick flick. Although, it was very realistic vs a fairy tale type story (although its still a happy-ish ending at the end).So yeah - if you have the time and are bored out of your mind, go ahead. If you have other stuff to do, skip right over this because you will want to slap yourself if you watch this instead of getting other stuff done. lol."
1,Disappointing,"Just a bad movie. If you want to see it, my suggestion is to wait for it to show up on television."
2,Friends with Kids,"semi amusing plot, but poorly executed. Fell asleep on it at first attempt to view and would prefer the 2hrs of my life back"
3,decent plot... until it resembled a porn movie,"I was following along with the movie and enjoying it... until right at the end, when I was immediately turned off. It suddenly made me think that the movie was just a long plot line to lead up to the porn. I understand the character development, and why it makes sense for the movie to go in that way, but it just threw me off and soured everything for me"
2,Very disappointing,"Based on the previews and the excellent billed cast, I was expecting a smart and intelligent movie. Instead, I got a terribly self-indulgent, cliched mess of a movie that is mostly the writer-director-star nattering on. She must have extreme narcissism to cast herself to play what I presume was supposed to be a charming and brilliant love interest. But the whole relationship was just creepy and weird, with a large age gap and no chemistry. Adam Scott did his best, but the rest of the great cast was utterly wasted and were clearly there as a favor for this rejected film-school project. Perhaps my high expectations are leading to an overly negative reaction to this film, but either way it was terrible and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1,DUMB,"This movie was the pits! I thought that by looking at the trailer it would be good, but Boy was I wrong"
3,It's OK.,"Could have been better. Did not like the original portrayal of parents with babies. But enjoyed many clever, clever moments."
3,Friends with Kids,"I really enjoyed Jennifer Westfeldt's previous movies. Her 3rd was rather funny and I enjoyed the actors chosen for the roles. It was okay overall, but it was missing something."
2,Such a great cast,"Such terrible writing and direction. The premise was a good one, but the execution left me wondering how you could come up with so less than the sum of the parts."
3,Friends With Kids,This was okay but it basically follows the same storyline as most of the movies out there where best friends will end up falling in love. The only difference is these friends had a baby together. I wasn't impressed.
3,Not Bad,"My wife made me watch this, and it wasn't bad. I made it through it. If you have kids you will be able to relate with the story line."
1,vulgar,Can never up date 'When Harry Met Sally' with a bunch of vulgarity. Almost had to plug my ears. Hope the kids were not on the set for some of this.
4,Funny and original!,This movie surprised me! It was funny and the acting is great! I enjoyed the way it moved along quickly and really drew me in.
2,dumb,i didnt enjoy the movie :/ it was time wasted.. i kept waiting for it to get better and it never did..
1,screaming constantly does not make it funny,"I was very excited for this movie, it had a cast that I really enjoy. However, i couldn't finish this one because it was painful and terrible in every way. Just a group of unpleasant people constantly screaming things that are meant to be a ""shocking"" kind of funny but it's just awkward and uncomfortable. A lot of times I enjoy some inappropriate humor and most comedies I enjoy are probably more rude and crude than others but this was just stupid and after about ten minutes became very predictable in what they were going to ""joke"" about next.As said before,I was really excited but I had to shut this one off."
3,Friends with kids,"I really only watched this movie because Jon Hamm is in it and I think he is a total hunk. Problem is, I didn't like his character in this movie at all, but that is ok because you aren't supposed to like his character in this movie, so, mission accomplished. Overall it wasn't a bad movie just not one I would recommend. I think the on screen chemistry was off."
4,Instant streaming Friends with Kids,"Movie was excellent-a cynical rom-com from Jennifer Westfeldt. Streaming was sub-par. Audio was low, and no subtitles were available. Image quality was average."
4,This movie is for everyone,"""Friends with Kids"" does an excellent job of expressing the different issues single and non-single people experience. I addition, it's funny and playful."
4,Good movie,I enjoyed this movie because it was a different take on the traditional rom/com. I liked how fresh and new it was and the writimg was very well done.
2,Great cast - disappointing movie,"How do you take such a great cast and make such a disappointing movie? I can't understand it. Perhapds a combination of bad script, bad directing, and probably bad producers too. This movie had a few chuckle moments, but mostly it was boring and a bit tiresome. Don't expect anything as nearly as funny as ""Bridesmaids"" in which 4 of the same actors starred and performed wonderfully. To top it off, this movie has such overt liberal left, anti-God, anti-religion overtones, it made the movie feel like a soapbox film instead of an enjoyable funny movie that it could have been."
5,LOVED IT!!!!,"I LOVED IT SO MUCH I WOULD PURCHASE IT, VERY FUNNY!!! THE STORY LINE WAS SO PERFECT AND THE ACTING WAS FANTASTIC!!"
2,Not as funny as expected....,"I expected a bit more sheer comedy, but as with many movies of its kind it starts off hilarious then goes into a serious message. Also in my opinion, Jennifer Westfelt is not funny at all."
1,Not a comedy,"I would really love to know why a movie that is in fact a drama would advertise itself as a comedy? The moviegoer, in this case, me, settles in to expect to laugh, especially with the cast of Friends with Kids but instead waits......and waits......and waits for the funny. The funny never comes. So the viewer gets disappointed and ends up thinking it's going to end up on her ""most hated movies"" list when really if they would have advertised it as a drama she would have approached it as such and could have made her determination based on the movie being serious....but, nooooooooo, she just gets to watch a really unfunny comedy."
2,meh,"I thought this might be a fun movie about the changes people go through when they become parents. It was funny from time to time, and did show how parenting wears on people, but the part that sticks with me is what a bunch of self absorbed jerks the characters are. That and what must be one of _the_ stupidest romantic exchanges in cinematic history: ""I'm gonna f___ the sh__ out of you""... ""OK f___ the sh__ out of me"". This is what you say to someone you just realized is your soul mate? This might be where I got too old and out of touch to understand popular culture."
1,"Really, Really bad movie.","This movie was terrible. It has a stupd plot. The language was terrible. The romantic climax is the male character trying to convince the girl that he loves her by repeating that he wants to ""f*** the sh** out of you."" Foul language doesn't necessarily offend me, when in an appropriate setting, but the language in this was completely inappropriate."
1,So disappointing. Cheesy dialogue. Trite.,Wow. Appalling. Why did so many good actors sign up to do this movie? Couldn't watch more than 30 minutes. The dialogue was weak and predictable. You know what characters are going to do/say before they do it. Really amateurish.
1,None,"Stupid movie...one of those movies that was trying too hard to be relevant and funny, and it just never clicked. The portrayal of people with kids was so cliche, as was the portrayal of people without kids...it just wasn't funny, and bordered on being annoying and ridiculous."
4,Great movie,Great movie for the family had an incredible time watching it couldnt stop laughing had me smiling from ear tto ear
4,not sure why its rated less than 4.5.....,worth a watch....:)this movie touches on modern romance and issues of 2012 in a witty and real-life fashion. Very enjoyable and believable.
4,A rom com with a difference,"The latest genre is the rom com and this is a story that you have seen before but it takes on a whole new dimension. I looked out for in the cinema in the UK and I saw it on the DVD before it got its showing in the cinema. I decided to buy it before it reached the cinema which I find myself doing more and more these days.To the film itself I really enjoyed and and so did the other special one who saw it with me.Movies to me are a great source of entertainment and and although this one may be rented more than bought I am glad I have it for my collection as I will see it again and again over the coming years.It will not get five stars but really it should be given four and half so although it is marked as a four it goes up a notch.Well done to the cast,crew and Jennifer Westfeldt who wrote and directed this film and I will do some research on IMDB Pro and may well purchase more of her work."
3,Not very original,"As one reviewer has already stated, this is ""Harry Meets Sally"" with a baby. Also with lots of crude sexual ""humor"". A couple of poignant moments, a few good laughs, but totally predictable."
2,Boring,They really stretched out this movie when you knew what was going to happen the whole time. It had some funny spots but overall it was boring.
4,Satisfying,"I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. It has a great cast, and I'm usually a fan of most everything Jennifer Westfeldt does. While the plot had a few clunks here and there, I thought it was overall a reflection of some common experiences we all have, and I found some of the scenes very touching. In one of what I thought would be a great scene, where they all travel together to the ski lodge, John Hamm's character destroys the mood of companionship because he's drunk and because he and his wife are falling apart. It was a little jarring, but a key scene in the movie. It was the turning point and provided the framework for the only resolution to the plot that wouild have worked. Well done overall, and if you haven't seen anything else with Westfeldt, give her a try. She's great as an actress, writer, and director."
2,"The more I think about it, the less I like it.","Had I written this review right after viewing the film, I probably would have given it three stars, but as the days have passed, I'm realizing how little I liked this movie. ""Friends With Kids"" has what seems to be a cast of comedy all-stars, but I was disappointed to find that the majority of those people are barely in the movie at all. Instead, it's basically the female lead/writer/director trying way too hard in every aspect, being a horrible actress, and Adam Scott being an unlikable jerk. In fact, nobody in this movie is likable. It became painfully obvious about halfway through that the only reason this film was made is because Jennifer Westfeldt is riding on the coattails of her partner, Jon Hamm, and was likely able to get this film made due to his success. I took nothing away from this film aside from wanting my 108 minutes back, which was quite disappointing because I really thought I'd enjoy it."
5,Witty and Fun,Loved the cast and the concept of the movie! Each character brought a real personality to the story and well it was just fabulous!!!
3,Fair at best,Kind of generic. Too bab bc i love adam scott... This seems like bridemaids 2.0. Needs a hot chic or will ferrell/vince vaughn type
4,Better than most,"This was a predictable story with a twist. Even though you could guess how the movie would end, I enjoyed how the story got there. Funny and cute. A great date night movie while the kids were at the grandparents."
2,It was OK,It was ok. There was 1 or 2 funny parts. Not terrible but not great either. I give it a 5 out of 10. Be prepared because the ending is really stupid.
1,wow-so disappointed,"Well, if you are hoping for a great movie with Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph....DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! It is no Bridesmaids. Wiig is barely in the movie, and the moments she is are the most depressing of the entire ALMOST TWO HOUR torture fest they call a film. Terrible writing. The ending made me want to vomit all over myself."
1,Waste of time and money,"This movie was a complete disappointment. I was ready to turn it off after the first 10 minutes, but having paid for it; I watched it and continued to hope it would get better.It didn't.The concept is cute, but that's about the only positive thing I would say about this film.I would not recommend it to any one, at all, ever."
2,"I wanted to like it, but...","I was so disappointed with this movie. I love the cast, but this movie made me hate most of them. It was very much a stereotype of married people with kids. The couples that hate each other and only yell and nit pick. You could tell about half way through the movie you were supposed to be rooting for the two main characters, but the father character was such a d-bag that I could not root for him. Very disappointed with the ending."
2,"One Dimensional Characters, Dialogue is Not Believable",The dialogue in this film between the two leads was annoying and not believable. The entire plot was far fetched and the main characters are over the top and one dimensional. Thank goodness it's only 99 cents.....
3,Moderately Entertaining,The movie was moderately entertaining. It could had been a lot better of a movie if it did'nt skip around so much on the timeline; at times it got to serious & I feel there could had been a lil more comedy to this movie. The men were definitely blunt & vulgar about there needs & wants; main subject revolved around sex;marriage & family life.
3,Different...,"I wouldn't say it was a 1 star, but it definitely isn't a 5 star movie. There is no real comedy here. I found some of the relationships and characters really weren't well developed. I can understand the concept and I think it was a nice twist on the traditional romantic movies, but it needed a bit more.It's a good movie for something to do...not for something with substance."
3,Eh,"Had some good moments. It was okay. In some ways the storyline was similar to The Switch with Jennifer Aniston. However, it was not as well written. I was not as invested in the characters."
4,Good not great,Good but not great. Was worth watching once but not something I think that I would watch again. Not what I was expecting either
2,Use subtitles option,"Many of the best lines in this mediocre movie are mumbled or talked over. Best to see it with subtitles. Although some scenes were authentic (lead male sprayed with baby poop while caring for his son), the adult ensemble scenes were predictable and the lead female/directors face inexpressive. Hard to get through the whole movie."
1,Horrible movie,"Waste of time, kept thinking it was going to get better but it didn't. Don't waste your time or money."
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"Dont waste your time, I couldn't even finish it. Not funny at all, boring as can be. Doesnt even deserve one star"
3,"Fun, Cheesy, Predictable",Nice for one of those days you feel like watching something light and humorous. Think SNL for chicks. Movie night rental ok...i would not own it.
3,Fizzles out,The movie starts strong with many big laughs... but fizzled out near the end and never quite recovers. Interesting themes though.
4,"Funny, cute, witty easy entertainment",This was a cute movie that didn't require a ton of intense concentration. A very good film to sit down and have a few good laughs with friends.
3,Friends With Kids,"I feel like this movie went a little overboard with showing the changes of relationships when having a child. Many parts were understandable, not a very logical movie, but a great cast felt like it could have been better with that much talent."
4,Fun movie,This movie was a good movie to be enjoyed by guys and gals. Made the time at the airport go by faster.
4,Sad,Im one that likes romantic sappy movies which this turns out to be. Truly liked the storyline and really liked the ending. Predictable but good
4,Surprisngly Really Good,"It's a shame because I think this movie never got it's due in theatrical release. I think it was overlooked because people just saw it as the people from Bridesmaids doing their friend a favor. The truth is, it's really good. I am a big Jennifer westfeldt fan, if for no other reason than I just appreciate her point of view. I think she's a really great woman telling great stories. Her movies can be flawed, but inherently I really like them. I just finished Friends with Kids and it was great. The performances were real and just good. My only issue is that while I loved Adam Scott, I didn't really believe that they ever had any real romantic chemistry. However, in that last moment, probably the most important moment, I did.On a side note, I know that Kristin Wiig wants to be this actress, and being cynical I've been thinking just stay to comedy, but I thought she was excellent and understated."
5,"Funny, sad - a laugh and a cry.","Lauren's review of this film could not have matched my own better, so I will just piggy-back off her review and ask you to read it. She gave it four stars and rightly so. I gave it five to counter a 1 star review that was sheer nonsense. There was only one negative for me, however. The dialogue in the last scene was unnecessarily vulgar and took the audience away from one of the most tender moments in the film. This is where Jason shows a side of himself that you hope is there, but because the character's sarcastic-laced wittiness is so pervasive, you're unsure. The very end was a bit disappointing, but did not alter my overall opinion of the movie."
1,Would a chick enjoy this flick?,"Really! The movie's screenwriters are probably gay writers who really thing straight people actually talk this way. Best friends do not continue to drop the ""F"" bomb every other word! If today's screenwiters had to write a script without it, they couldn't.The storyline was intriguing, and I would've given it a 3 if not for the profanity. And the previous writer had it right....the last line is supposed to be a turn-on???? Ha!"
3,Not as good as I thought it would be,"I liked the movie but it wasn't nearly as funny as I thought it would be with the cast--especially Maya Rudolph. It's ok. But more of a ""chick flick"" than anything."
2,Not so good,"It looked promising and the talent was certainly there...Super predictable ending, nothing much to see here.It was pretty funny when Don Draper got Mad in a climactic scene towards the end but that is all I remember."
4,well....,"love the story (what if) line, and the fact that your soul mate can be your best friend, still it would have done without so much fowl language, it kind off degrades the whole romantic feeling of the movie, specially the end, but then again can help feeling that is what the viewers find entertaining, I'm old school!"
3,A little bit of a bait & switch.,"The movie is fine, has a good story and GREAT actors... but the marketing of this film was very misleading. They really played up the ""featuring most of the case of Bridesmaids"" angle, and implied it was a comedy... which is definitely is not. A fairly heavy relationship drama, maybe only one funny line in the whole film. It's fine as a drama but don't go into it expecting a comedy."
2,COULDN'T EVEN FINISH IT,"I tried....I really did....but the characters were so boring. Maybe it's because I'm a grandmother, but I found myself thinking how immature they were and that they all needed to grow up! They were irritatingly self-absorbed people so that lines I think we're meant to be funny .....well, they weren't at all. And they talked like teenagers who just discovered four letter words....I mean, I throw them around when it feels right but Westfeldt seemed to depend on them instead of genuine dialogue far too often. Like I said, maybe I'm just too old to appreciate these ""adults""......"
1,Horse manure,"Within two minutes of this crass, vulgar so-called comedy, one of the supposedly charming male leads tells a female friend over the phone that she needs to get the cobwebs out of her vagina. Less than 10 minutes in, he's telling her men worry about their partners having a baby because they fret the mother's vaginas will become cavernous and therefore she won't be attractive. And click went the off button. I've seen my wife struggle at times to deal with almost casual sexism that can damage a career, I watch with alarm as my teenage daughter navigates a modern culture where some players seem to delight in putting down women, and Friends with Kids is just continuing that trend. Shame on everyone involved in this pile of ordure."
2,Tries to make some good points but gets tiresome,Nice acting by the leads but the story is silly and unreal. It does make the great point that being a small family can be extremely satisfying and romantic in many ways but it does not make entertaining viewing even with the best of writing.The logical process for why they decided to have a baby is totally unbelievable.
2,Had high hopes,"Overall I feel that this film was a wasted opportunity. A misused cast, a self indulgent script and immature directing."
3,Cute Movie,"This was a worthwhile rental for my long flight to the East coast. It is a romcom with a twist, which I appreciated. It is hard to do something new with the romcom genre. The characters were believable, even if somewhat stereotypical. The quickfire banter was entertaining. I'm glad I didn't see it in the theater, but I am happy that I rented it."
2,Okay movie. Terrible ending.,"I thought the movie was just okay - not really very good from my point of view, but I didn't shut it off. I wish I had before the ending. The dialog sounded like something someone might hear in a bad porn film or something like that. It really left the movie hanging on a bad note for me."
1,Did not enjoy,I was very disappointed by this movie. This movie promised to be thoughtful and witty with a cast including Jon Hamm and Kristen Wiig. I thought the premise of kids changing a group of friends and the couples themselves would be interesting and relatable. The characters proved to be unable to evoke much sympathy from me as they wallowed in their disappointments with life. I found the movie depressing and un-insightful.
1,Not too great at all. Hmmmmm!,"I was dying to see this movie mostly because of the cast. Movie was very slow and not too funny at all. I thought the characters were shallow and snooze worthy. I did not buy any of the relationships at all. The best part of this film was Jon Hamm's monologue at the dinner table. That was the only good part. I thought that the two leads (Adam Scott and Jennifer Westfeldt were horrible and annoying), I did not believe the ending at all. This was not a film I would recommend to anyone at all unless I was going to show them how NOT to write a script and how NOT to direct a movie."
2,just ok,"i was really looking forward to this movie but was disappointed. I thought Kristen Wigg and Maya would be in it more, didn't find Jennifer Westfeldt very funny, Adam Scott was good. Seemed to drag on, won't watch it again. And the comment Jon Hamm's character made at the dinner table at the ski cabin...just ugly!"
1,Please don't watch this,"Just terrible. If you really think you have to watch it, just watch the first 5 minutes. You'll know exactly what's going to happen after that."
2,It's just OK,"I thought this would be along the more entertaining lines of Bridesmaids and the like, but this film disappoints. If anything, it offers interesting cameos from Jon Hamm, Kristen Wiig, and Maya Rudolph, but mostly we spend way too much time with the main characters, who are frankly, annoying."
2,Mediocre to say the least...,"Was excited for the cast and since I loved Brides Maids. However, this movie is not written nearly as well and had few if any lough out loud moments. The whole concept of the movie was uninteresting to me. Mya Rudolph and her husband are the only real bright spot in this movie."
2,Could have been a good movie.....,"This movie has actually funny parts and the characters are also played pretty well. This movie could have been good if the language used would have been more real, ...unless the average person in New York really has such bad and degrading language, which I doubt.The way the characters speak sounds more appropriate for clubbing teenagers than real adults.I guess the female author tried to appeal to the male audience with this movie as well instead of creating ""just a chick-flick"", a try that went badly wrong in my opinion."
2,Strong language,"Okay movie but slightly overdone, particularly the use of strong language. I would think it may appeal to the younger set. I watched it with my 42 year old daughter and we both felt the same about it."
2,Dragged out,"Why say in 30 minutes what you can say in and hour and 47? There is one small story in this movie that is addressed, readdressed, and never stops getting addressed throughout the movie yet never gets developed. I felt like I could have guessed the rest of the movie the minute Jason says ""Let's do it.""Neither Wiig nor Hamm are funny let alone entertaining but are in fact the depressing force in this story. Scott is entirely unbelievable as a womanizer. Poor casting overall.SPOILER: the dramatic ending is sudden, forced, predictable, and completely anticlimactic.It is still a good story and even topical, albeit expounded to the point of frustration. I won't be watching it a second time."
3,Decent Flick,Nice warm humorous romantic comedy that is not too syrupy sweet. Decent choice for date night. Decent acting. Good cinematography.
4,Pretty funny!,"This movie does bring out a lot of good points. Relationships, friendships and real life situations...over all a pretty good movie."
1,So bad we couldn't even get all the way through it,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Contrived plot, terrible writing and mediocre acting combine for a complete waste of time."
2,Did I miss something?,"Some nice moments, but really, what WAS the point? I was just really left with a ""So What?"" kinda feeling."
4,Loved this movie!!!,This movie was great! Super funny & touching at the same time. Made me fall in love w/ Adam Scott.
1,One of the Worst......,"Nope, the worst movie I have seen in a long long time, and besides not being funny...who's the one with plastic surgery from hell?"
2,Rather boring,"I am sorry, there is virtually no chemistry between the two leads, Adam Scott and Jennifer Westfeldt. I looked forward to this movie because of the indy hype. The cast is high caliber--Jon Hamm, Maya Rudolph, Kristin Wiig, but they were all just going through the motions. The script is predictable. Sadly, it was not worth four dollars to stream."
1,So this is Comedy?,This is not a comedy. Do friends really talk so nasty? The story could have been very funny and did have some soul touching moments. The end was predictable and but the dialogue was a epic let down.
1,Wow A Very Sad Almost...,"Wow, I listened to the NPR interview with Maya Rudolph and Terry Grose and was captivated by the movie's content. I have two breatuful daughters and a lovely wife. We have had our beautiful daughters and many tough time that the movie failed to relate to on so many levels. The ending dailog was the worst. If I had been asked to write the lines I could have saved it but the lines were put to film. Is there something less than one star. The one was only for trying. What I would actually rate this movie was that you invaded being a human with children. Nothing redeeming for those who have childred and love them."
3,"Not the brightest, but good for focused lighting","I tested this flashlight in my dark barn. Usually, I carry a larger flashlight with a wide, yellow beam so I won't step on any cats or chickens. As far as size, it is conveniently small. But after shaking back and forth according to the instructions, it still did not cast a very wide beam.I felt like it worked best for focused lighting-- as in, reading maps or books. The light is pale and doesn't spread out, so if you're looking for a flashlight that will help you avoid tripping in the dark, this might not be the best one.Still, not needing batteries or bulbs is convenient, and I haven't had any problems with the light fading or going out. As far as walking outside in the dark or going into my barn, though, I still prefer a brighter flashlight. Maybe it's only a matter of perfecting the new technology."
3,"I bought 2, Only 1 worked","Pretty cool product. I researched a ton of them and this seemed perfect. I ordered 2. One didnt work, but amazon has an easy return policy. I'll try it out in real life and I will report back.Also it warns you to keep away from credit cards laptops and TVs since it has a magnetic pull!!"
2,"Better than nothing, but not for long","I really wanted to like this flashlight. It's a cool idea, and I'd really like to get away from keeping batteries on hand in an emergency. The light isn't very bright, as many people have said, and it's the weird LCD light. This would still be ok for power outages, etc., but for one thing - the first time I used it, the cat bumped it and it fell to the floor - the thing shattered. Not exaggerating - broke into a lot of really tiny pieces. I still don't know if I've found all of it. What a waste of money. Any normal flashlight would have been fine. This thing is a fad. Do yourself a favor and keep something sturdy nearby - with batteries, of course."
1,Bad flashlight,"This flashlight is not waterproof! If you looking for waterproof, do not buy this. I dropped into water then I have water inside now."
2,"After a year, it loses value","I've had this flashlight for over a year. The concept was great until time passed and it needed more vigorous shaking just to shine for 30 seconds or less. We kept this flashlight in the car for emergencies. However, it's a pretty long flashlight and we've found smaller flashlights on Amazon that are crank based and therefore take far less effort and shine brighter. For a similar price, you can find these crank flashlights that nowadays use LEDs and offer cell phone-charging capabilities as well as a built-in radio."
2,Good idea but not very useful,Forever last flashlight does not need battery. You shake the flashlight to generate electric power. Shake it for one minute can last for 100 minutes the ad says. But the light is so dim that it is useless for most purposes. I eventually bought regular LED flashlight with batteries. It is so bright that I stopped using Forever Last Flashlight.
1,Don't waste your hard earn $$$,"I wish it could have turned out to be another great product from Amazon. I purchased one, tested it and was impressed by the light and how little effort it took to get charged. It was like instant power. Since I was leaving for a month long vacation to Pakistan, I ordered 4 more for my family back home. I didn't have time to test all of them. Unfortunately, only one of them worked for a week or so and then it won't work. After shaking it for 10 min would give about 2-3 min, very weak, light.Please note that it was operated in about 70 to 80+ tempratures. It won't work no matter what. This is just a piece of crap in my experience."
4,Father's Day gift for my dad,"I put this in a ""camping theme"" basket for my dad. He loves it! He said he can take it camping, or have it in the car or someplace for an emergency... the possibilities are endless because this Flashlight will never die! I think it's a great item & a great gift. Great price, too!"
1,Not good,"You have to continually shake this flashlight to get ANY light, and what you get isn't much for all that shaking. I'd pass and buy a real flashlight."
1,buyer beware,"I purchased one of these types of flashlights at a gun show. Upon returning home and close inspection,I noticed that there was a sm. buttonbattery bundle inside. After a few months the light stopped working ,regardless of shaking it like a dry martini. I ended up throwing the thing in the trash(wasn't very expensive). I don't know about this product. Maybe it is the real deal,but beware of the little things. If you see a bundle of button batteries,send it back."
1,"Sadly, quite disappointed after manufacturer said no warranty at all","I had bought Faraday-style flashlights before, and this one ""appeared"" to be better than most (though like most of this style is not very bright). I have one in my glove box, and purchased another for my son's stocking for Christmas. Alas, two weeks after Christmas he dropped it about a foot to the road while walking to school (he is only five so he is close to the ground). The top black screw-on ring that holds the lens on shattered into a ton of pieces. I emailed iTouchless asking if I could purchase the top piece, and they replied ""no"", along with the message ""in addition, there is no warranty for this product."" Well, honestly, I could understand not selling parts even though I don't like it. But stating there is no warranty at all? I guess they can have whatever quality they want since they don't promise it will work, even new! Buyer beware: don't drop this thing at any height onto anything or you are out $16."
4,Almost perfect,"Just used it on an overnight fishing trip. Works underwater, floats, no batteries. The main prblem though with this light is that its made of clear plastic. So the light comes out the back of the flashlight. I plan on painting mine to get rid of that problem though."
3,"Good Light, not the best, but in a pinch it does help.","Good Light, not the best, but in a pinch it does help.Great to have, but the light focus is a little on the lacking side.But still if you don't have a flash light handy, this is a great light to have.... no batteries needed!"
1,I won't even give it 1 star!,"This is a FAKKEEEE!!! I needed it for my project, and when I opened it I was disappointed at what I found!Basically a shake light is supposed to have a magnet inside a container that is wrapped with a lot of copper wire. But What I found was a plastic container(not really the best for induction), with a piece of metal (not magnet), and a plastic copper sticker... And what is powering this fake ""shake"" light are batteries. DO NOT BUY, unless you just want a weak cheap looking flashlight for random needs, I guess you do get what you pay for!"
1,don't buy,I shook this flashlight for 2 minutes instead of 1 minute andstill I only get about 3 minutes of light. I bought my grandchildrena different brand and it works much better. Don't waste your moneylike I did.
1,Do not buy this product,"As a fireman who works in emergency situations I give this product a D-. The manufacture claims if you shake the light for 1 minute it ""will last up to 100 minutes"". This is false. I followed manufactures directions and shook for 1 minute (approx. 180 times). What I got was 6 minutes 45 seconds of light which consisted or 3 minutes of good light followed by the rest consisting of dim night light. I repeated this experiment 10 times, each time getting similar results. After that I shook for 2 minutes and lasted for about 8-9 minutes each time. The only reason I gave it one star is because unit if built well. Too bad the light part is very poor. I'm going to return this and try wind 'n go flashlight. I'll update this review after I get it."
3,It's OK but not great...,The Bad- It's not as bright as I expected.- The solenoid gets stucked sometimes and wont let you recharge.The Good- Very strong casing. It's almost unbreakable- Still a good concept product.
1,Very short 'forever'!,"Within a week the switch on this flashlight broke. I was able to fix it and now, a few months later, it's just stopped working completely. It flashes on for a second each time you shake it, if you hold the switch on... Great idea, poor execution!"
1,worthess touchless,This product did not work out of the box. It was a present for my son who loves flashlights. I thought I might save on batteries. I shook the flashlight many many times and it just didn't work. Unfortunately I missed the return date and it is now in the trash. That is a very expensive piece of trash. I do NOT recommend this to anyone.
1,Don't Waste Your money!,"Don't waste your money, this light is a piece of crap. I bought three in the hopes that they would actually work the way they are advertised. Right off the bat one was defective and then only a couple months later the second one is done. The idea is great, I mean, who wouldn't want a flashlight that lasts forever without batteries? The execution however, is poor. Another plastic ""Made in China"" piece of junk."
